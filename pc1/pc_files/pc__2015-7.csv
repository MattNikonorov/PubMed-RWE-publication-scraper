The crude extract of Euphorbia formosana (CEEF) has been used for treatment of different diseases but the cytotoxic effects of CEEF on human cancer cells have not been reported. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine effects of CEEF on cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis in DU145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Contrast-phase microscope was used for examining cell morphological changes. Flow cytometric assays were used for cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, and Ca2+ production and mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm ). Western blotting was used for examining protein expression of cell cycle and apoptosis associated proteins. Real-time PCR was used for examining mRNA levels of caspase-3, -8, and -9, AIF, and Endo G. Confocal laser microscope was used to examine the translocation of AIF, Endo G, and cytochrome in DU145 cells after CEEF exposure. CEEF-induced cell morphological changes, decreased the percentage of viable cells, and induced S phase arrest and apoptosis in DU145 cells. Furthermore, CEEF promoted RAS and Ca2+ production and reduced ΔΨm levels. Real-time QPCR confirmed that CEEF promoted the mRNA expression of caspase-3 and -9, AIF and Endo G and we found that AIF and Endo G and cytochrome c were released from mitochondria. Taken together, CEEF-induced cytotoxic effects via ROS production, induced S phase arrest and induction of apoptosis through caspase-dependent and independent and mitochondria-dependent pathways in DU245 cancer cells. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In recent years, research on the use of ferrite nanoparticles in T2 contrast agents has shown a great potential application in MR imaging. In this work, Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 and Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-DMSA magnetic nanoparticles, CZF-MNPs and CZF-MNPs-DMSA, were investigated as MR imaging contrast agents.  Methods:   Cobalt zinc ferrite nanoparticles and their suitable coating, DMSA, were investigated under in vitro condition. Human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3) with bare (uncoated) and coated magnetic nanoparticles were investigated as nano-contrast MR imaging agents.  Results:   Using T2-weighted MR images identified that signal intensity of bare and coated MNPs was enhanced with increasing concentration of MNPs in water. The values of 1/T2 relaxivity (r2) for bare and coated MNPs were found to be 88.46 and 28.80 (mM (-1) s(-1)), respectively.  Conclusion:   The results show that bare and coated MNPs are suitable as T2-weighted MR imaging contrast agents. Also, the obtained r2/r1 values (59.3 and 50) for bare and coated MNPs were in agreement with the results of other previous relevant works.""","""['Zeinab Ghasemian', 'Daryoush Shahbazi-Gahrouei', 'Sohrab Manouchehri']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Avicenna J Med Biotechnol""","""['Assessment of Manganese-Zinc Ferrite Nanoparticles as a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent for the Detection of 4T1 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Superparamagnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles as T2 contrast agent in MRI: in vitro study.', 'Design and characterization of lisinopril-loaded superparamagnetic nanoparticles as a new contrast agent for in vitro, in vivo MRI imaging, diagnose the tumors and drug delivery system.', 'Polymer-Coated Magnetite Nanoparticles for Protein Immobilization.', 'Contrast agents: magnetic resonance.', 'Advances in the Synthesis and Application of Magnetic Ferrite Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy.', 'Spinel ferrite (AFe2O4)-based heterostructured designs for lithium-ion battery, environmental monitoring, and biomedical applications.', 'Design and Synthesis of Luminescent Lanthanide-Based Bimodal Nanoprobes for Dual Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Optical Imaging.', 'Assessment of Manganese-Zinc Ferrite Nanoparticles as a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent for the Detection of 4T1 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeted T1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Enhancement with Extraordinarily Small CoFe2O4 Nanoparticles.']"""

Prostate cancer was the most common cancer in men (ASR 40.6 per 100,000) while breast cancer was the most common among women (ASR 51.7 per 100,000). Cervical cancer ranked the second most common cancer among women in Nairobi with an ASR of 46.1 per 100,000, somewhat lower than those of other registries in East Africa region. Breast and cervical cancers accounted for 44% of all cancers in women. Cancer of the oesophagus was common in both sexes, with a slight excess of cases in men (sex ratio 1.3). Unlike other regions in East Africa, the rate of Kaposi sarcoma was relatively low during the period (men 3.6/100,000; women 2.0/100,000).

Isolation/characterization of PCa-derived exosomes from bodily fluids enables us to discover new markers for this disease. Unfortunately, isolation with current techniques (ultracentrifugation) is labor intensive and other techniques are still under development. The goal of our study was to develop a highly sensitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TR-FIA) for capture/detection of PCa-derived exosomes. In our assay, biotinylated capture antibodies against human CD9 or CD63 were incubated on streptavidin-coated wells. After application of exosomes, Europium-labeled detection antibodies (CD9 or CD63) were added. Cell medium from 37 cell lines was taken to validate this TR-FIA. Urine was collected (after digital rectal exam) from patients with PCa (n = 67), men without PCa (n = 76). As a control, urine was collected from men after radical prostatectomy (n = 13), women (n = 16) and patients with prostate cancer without digital rectal exam (n = 16). Signal intensities were corrected for urinary PSA and creatinine. This TR-FIA can measure purified exosomes with high sensitivity and minimal background signals. Exosomes can be measured in medium from 37 cell lines and in urine. DRE resulted in a pronounced increase in CD63 signals. After DRE and correction for urinary PSA, CD9 and CD63 were significantly higher in men with PCa. This TR-FIA enabled us to measure exosomes with high sensitivity directly from urine and cell medium. This TR-FIA forms the basis for testing different antibodies directed against exosome membrane markers to generate disease-specific detection assays.""","""['Diederick Duijvesz', 'C Yin L Versluis', 'Christa A M van der Fels', 'Mirella S Vredenbregt-van den Berg', 'Janne Leivo', 'Mari T Peltola', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Kim S I Pettersson', 'Guido Jenster']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.', 'Comparative analysis of prostate cancer specific biomarkers PCA3 and ERG in whole urine, urinary sediments and exosomes.', 'Nanoscale flow cytometry to distinguish subpopulations of prostate extracellular vesicles in patient plasma.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Update on the diagnosis of PCa in urine.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays important roles in human prostate cancer progression. Deletion of the endogenous Wnt antagonist adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) in mice causes high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, widely thought to be the precursor to prostate cancer. However, no metastasis occurrs in this model. New mouse models are needed to determine molecular causes of tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis.  Methods:   To determine whether the overexpression of the prostate oncogene Hepsin could cause prostate cancer progression, we crossed a prostate-specific Hepsin overexpression model to a prostate-specific Apc-deletion model and classified the observed phenotype.  Results:   When Apc was deleted and Hepsin overexpressed concurrently, mice displayed invasive carcinoma, with loss of membrane characteristics and increase of fibrosis. These tumors had both luminal and basaloid characteristics. Though no metastasis was observed, there was evidence of adenomas and lung necrosis, inflammation, and chronic hemorrhage.  Conclusions:   This work indicates that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the Hepsin pathway act in concert to promote prostate cancer progression.

Results:   Dialectical analysis revealed men experienced four tensions; a) obligation to disclose/autonomy not to disclose; b) confident to help others/vulnerable and needing help from others; c) accept support/not accept support and d) desire for normality/need to tolerate uncertainty. These tensions were predominantly managed by vacillation. Specifically, the men used their communication network to select one pole with some people and the other pole with others to maintain balance between the poles of the dialectical tensions.  Conclusions:   Health care professionals can help men in this situation by having a conversation about disclosure and support prior to them being diagnosed, educating men to reframe or connect as a more effective form of tension management, and linking men who have small or ineffective networks to other resources such as social support networks to facilitate tension management.""","""['Dot Brown', 'John Oetzel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""['Communication networks of men facing a diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Qualitative insights into how men with low-risk prostate cancer choosing active surveillance negotiate stress and uncertainty.', ""Sharing experiences in a support group: men's talk during the radiotherapy period for prostate cancer."", 'Psychosocial barriers to active surveillance for the management of early prostate cancer and a strategy for increased acceptance.', 'Sexual intimacy in heterosexual couples after prostate cancer treatment: What we know and what we still need to learn.', ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", ""Men's perception of information and descriptions of emotional strain in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer-a qualitative individual interview study.""]"""

In the present study, we stably knocked down PKP1 in the non-neoplastic, prostatic BPH-1 cell line. In the PKP1-deficient cells, the expression of keratin 14 was lost, and the apoptosis rate was significantly reduced indicating that the cells acquired new biological capabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the gene expression profile of the PKP1-deficient BPH-1 cells. Among the genes that were significantly altered upon PKP1 knockdown, we noticed several extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes and identified sparc/osteonectin, cwcv, and kazal-like domains proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1/testican-1) as a gene of interest. SPOCK1 is a component of the ECM and belongs to a matricellular protein family named secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC). The role of SPOCK1 in prostate cancer has not been clearly elucidated. We analyzed SPOCK1 mRNA expression levels in different cancer databases and characterized its expression in 136 prostatic adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry and western blot. SPOCK1 revealed a cytoplasmic localization in the glandular epithelium of the prostate and showed a significant upregulation of mRNA and protein in prostate tumor samples. Our findings support the hypothesis that PKP1 may have a tumor-suppressive function and suggest an important role of SPOCK1 in prostate tumor progression.

These inconsistencies are likely attributable, in part, to biases that arise due to post-diagnostic and post-treatment TL measurement. To avoid such biases, we used a Mendelian randomization approach and estimated associations between nine TL-associated SNPs and risk for five common cancer types (breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian and prostate cancer, including subtypes) using data on 51 725 cases and 62 035 controls. We then used an inverse-variance weighted average of the SNP-specific associations to estimate the association between a genetic score representing long TL and cancer risk. The long TL genetic score was significantly associated with increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma (P = 6.3 × 10(-15)), even after exclusion of a SNP residing in a known lung cancer susceptibility region (TERT-CLPTM1L) P = 6.6 × 10(-6)). Under Mendelian randomization assumptions, the association estimate [odds ratio (OR) = 2.78] is interpreted as the OR for lung adenocarcinoma corresponding to a 1000 bp increase in TL. The weighted TL SNP score was not associated with other cancer types or subtypes. Our finding that genetic determinants of long TL increase lung adenocarcinoma risk avoids issues with reverse causality and residual confounding that arise in observational studies of TL and disease risk. Under Mendelian randomization assumptions, our finding suggests that longer TL increases lung adenocarcinoma risk. However, caution regarding this causal interpretation is warranted in light of the potential issue of pleiotropy, and a more general interpretation is that SNPs influencing telomere biology are also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma risk.""","""['Chenan Zhang', 'Jennifer A Doherty', 'Stephen Burgess', 'Rayjean J Hung', 'Sara Lindström', 'Peter Kraft', 'Jian Gong', 'Christopher I Amos', 'Thomas A Sellers', 'Alvaro N A Monteiro', 'Georgia Chenevix-Trench', 'Heike Bickeböller', 'Angela Risch', 'Paul Brennan', 'James D Mckay', 'Richard S Houlston', 'Maria Teresa Landi', 'Maria N Timofeeva', 'Yufei Wang', 'Joachim Heinrich', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'Ken Muir', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Fredrick Schumacher', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Brian E Henderson', 'Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Irene L Andrulis', 'John L Hopper', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Esther M John', 'Kathleen E Malone', 'Marilie D Gammon', 'Giske Ursin', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'David J Hunter', 'Stephen B Gruber', 'Julia A Knight', 'Lifang Hou', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Polly A Newcomb', 'Thomas J Hudson', 'Andrew T Chan', 'Li Li', 'Michael O Woods', 'Habibul Ahsan', 'Brandon L Pierce;GECCO and GAME-ON Network: CORECT', ' DRIVE', ' ELLIPSE', ' FOCI', ' and TRICL']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Mendelian randomization study of telomere length and lung cancer risk in East Asian population.', 'Mendelian Randomization and mediation analysis of leukocyte telomere length and risk of lung and head and neck cancers.', 'Association Between Telomere Length and Risk of Cancer and Non-Neoplastic Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Challenges and factors that influencing causal inference and interpretation, based on Mendelian randomization studies.', 'Genetic determinants of telomere length and cancer risk.', 'Genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma in East Asia and comparison with a European population.', 'Common genetic variations in telomere length genes and lung cancer: a Mendelian randomisation study and its novel application in lung tumour transcriptome.', 'Harnessing Genomic Analysis to Explore the Role of Telomeres in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease.', 'Implications of risk conferred by 5p15.33 loci genetic variants; human telomerase reverse transcriptase rs2736098 and rs2736100 in predisposition of bladder cancer.', 'Persistent organic pollutant exposure contributes to Black/White differences in leukocyte telomere length in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.']"""

However, some men might not adhere to these strict protocols.  Objective:   To determine the number of noncompliers and disease reclassification rates in men not complying with the follow-up protocol of the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 4547 men with low-risk prostate cancer were included and prospectively followed on AS. Men were regularly examined using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, and repeat biopsies, and were advised to switch to definitive treatment on disease reclassification (>cT2c, Gleason score > 3+3, >2 cores positive, or PSA doubling time [PSA-DT] 0-3 yr).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Rates of men not complying with follow-up visits or a recommendation to discontinue AS are reported. Biopsy outcome (Gleason ≥7 or >2 cores positive) was compared between compliers and noncompliers using Cox proportional hazards analysis.  Results and limitations:   The compliance rate for PSA visits was 91%. By contrast, the compliance rate for standard repeat biopsies decreased over time (81%, 60%, 53%, and 33% at 1, 4, 7, and 10 yr after diagnosis, respectively). Yearly repeat biopsies in men with faster rising PSA (PSA-DT 3-10 yr) was low at <30%, although these men had higher upgrading rates at repeat biopsy (25-30% vs 16%). PSA-DT of 0-3 yr was the most common recommendation for discontinuation, but 71% continued on AS. Men with PSA-DT of 0-3 yr were at higher risk of upgrading on repeat biopsy (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.36-3.00) compared to men without fast rising PSA.  Conclusion:   Some men and their physicians do not comply with AS follow-up protocols. In particular, yearly repeat biopsies in men with fast rising PSA are often ignored, as is the recommendation to discontinue AS because of very fast rising PSA. Although these men are at greater risk of higher Gleason scores on repeat biopsy, the majority still exhibit favorable tumor characteristics. Fast rising PSA should therefore not trigger a recommendation to receive active treatment, but should rather serve as a criterion for stricter follow-up. In addition, we should aim to find ways of safely reducing the number of biopsies to increase adherence to AS protocols.  Patient summary:   We looked at compliance with an active surveillance protocol for low-risk prostate cancer in a large active surveillance study. We observed reluctance to undergo yearly biopsies because of fast rising prostate-specific antigen, despite a higher risk of disease progression. Further research should aim to safely reduce the number of repeat biopsies in men on active surveillance to increase protocol adherence.""","""['Leonard P Bokhorst', 'Arnout R Alberts', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Tom Pickles', 'Yoshiyuki Kakehi', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Monique J Roobol;PRIAS study group']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Evolution of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Refined Analysis of Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics to Predict Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Outcomes.', 'Predictors of unfavourable repeat biopsy results in men participating in a prospective active surveillance program.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Development and External Validation of the STRATified CANcer Surveillance (STRATCANS) Multivariable Model for Predicting Progression in Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Starting Active Surveillance.', 'Detecting Liver Cancer Using Cell-Free DNA Fragmentomes.', 'Risk of progression following a negative biopsy in prostate cancer active surveillance.', 'The impact of age on prostate cancer progression and quality of life in active surveillance patients.']"""

Objective:   To report outcomes for men who underwent surgery after AS compared to men who underwent immediate surgery and the influence of selection bias on this outcome.  Design, setting, and participants:   AS-eligible (ASE) men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) after a median of 20 mo of AS were compared to ASE men who underwent RP within 6 mo of diagnosis. A subset of men on AS who underwent RP after upgrade to Gleason 3+4 was compared to matched controls with similar pretreatment biopsy features who underwent immediate RP.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   Rates of adverse pathology (upstaging, positive surgical margin, or Gleason upgrading) were examined. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between treatment subgroup and adverse pathology.  Results and limitations:   Of 157 ASE men who underwent delayed RP after AS, 54 were upgraded to Gleason 3+4 before surgery. ASE men who underwent immediate RP had lower probability of adverse pathology than ASE men who underwent delayed RP (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.55). The rate of adverse pathology did not differ between immediate and delayed RP patients matched for pretreatment characteristics (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.27-2.28). The observational design of this study is its main limitation.

Objective:   To determine whether the use of different types of ADT in patients with PCa is associated with an increased incidence of VTE.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort study was conducted using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics repository. The cohort consisted of men newly diagnosed with PCa between April 1, 1998, and March 31, 2014.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards models with a time-varying exposure definition were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of patients hospitalized for VTE associated with current and past ADT use compared with nonuse. A secondary analysis was conducted to assess the risk with current use of specific types of ADT.  Results and limitations:   The cohort included 21 729 patients, of whom 609 were hospitalized for VTE during follow-up. Current ADT use was associated with an 84% increased risk of VTE (incidence rates: 10.1 vs 4.8 per 1000 person-years; HR: 1.84; 95% CI, 1.50-2.26), whereas there was no association with past use (HR: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.81-1.42). In the secondary analysis, most types of ADT were associated with a high risk of VTE. Residual confounding is possible given the observational nature of the study.  Conclusions:   The use of ADT was associated with an overall 84% increased risk of VTE, with the risk elevated for most ADT types.  Patient summary:   In this study, we investigated whether androgen deprivation therapy was associated with the risk of blood clots in a cohort of patients with prostate cancer. We observed that the risk was nearly doubled in patients who used ADT compared with those who never used it.

Remarkably, also castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is dependent on functional AR, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the addiction. Known causes of CRPC include gene amplification and overexpression as well as point mutations of AR. We report here the pharmacological profile of ODM-201, a novel AR inhibitor that showed significant antitumor activity and a favorable safety profile in phase 1/2 studies in men with CRPC. ODM-201 is a full and high-affinity AR antagonist that, similar to second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509, inhibits testosterone-induced nuclear translocation of AR. Importantly, ODM-201 also blocks the activity of the tested mutant ARs arising in response to antiandrogen therapies, including the F876L mutation that confers resistance to enzalutamide and ARN-509. In addition, ODM-201 reduces the growth of AR-overexpressing VCaP prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in a castration-resistant VCaP xenograft model. In contrast to other antiandrogens, ODM-201 shows negligible brain penetrance and does not increase serum testosterone levels in mice. In conclusion, ODM-201 is a potent AR inhibitor that overcomes resistance to AR-targeted therapies by antagonizing both overexpressed and mutated ARs.

Materials and methods:   With IRB approval, 145 consecutive patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and multi-parametric (T2W+DWI+DCE) MRI between 2012 and 2013. Eighty patients (66.3% with EPE) were staged without PI-RADS and 65 patients (64.6% with EPE) were staged using a 5-point PI-RADS scoring system. Studies were reported by fellowship-trained radiologists in routine clinical practice. Individual PIRADS scores were assessed using ROC to determine the score which optimized sensitivity/specificity. Diagnostic accuracy for EPE was compared with/without PI-RADS using the McNemar test. Subgroup analysis by radiologist experience was performed using Spearman correlation and chi-square.  Results:   Area under ROC curve for EPE using PI-RADS was 0.62 and optimal sensitivity/specificity was achieved with PI-RADS score ≥ 3. Compared to non-standardized reporting, sensitivity for EPE improved with PI-RADS (59.5% [49.1-68.2] vs. 24.5% [16.7-31.2]), p=0.01; with no difference in specificity (68.0% [50.5-82.6]) vs. (75.0% [60.1-87.6]), p=0.06. Overall accuracy improved with PI-RADS (62.7% [49.6-73.6] vs. 42.0% [31.7-50.7%]), p=0.006. Diagnostic accuracy was better among experienced radiologists without PI-RADS (p=0.005); however, there was no difference in accuracy by reader experience using PI-RADS (p=0.24).

Thus, numerous studies have focused on the development of novel treatments for brain tumors. Frog ribonucleases, such as Onconase and Rana catesbeiana ribonuclease (RC-RNase), exert antitumor effects on various tumor cells, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer cells. In addition, frog Onconase has been applied as a treatment in clinical trials. However, the antitumor effects of frog ribonucleases on brain tumors are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that RC-RNase demonstrates a decreased cytotoxic effect in normal cells compared with Onconase. Therefore, the present study investigated the ability of RC-RNase to exert antitumor activities on human glioblastoma. It was found that RC-RNase inhibits the growth of the human glioblastoma DBTRG, GBM8901 and GBM8401 cells. In addition, the present study revealed that RC-RNase induces caspase-9/-3 activity and triggers the apoptotic cell death pathway in human glioblastoma cells.

Immunostaining of CgA was performed using prostate biopsy samples obtained at the initial PCa diagnosis, during androgen deprivation therapy, at the time of CRPC diagnosis, and after 2 cycles of DEC therapy. The positive rate was expressed as the mean percentage of positively stained tumor cells against the total number of tumor cells. Differences in positive rates among the treatment courses were compared using a Mann-Whitney test.  Results:   The mean percentage of CgA-positive PCa cells increased in a stepwise manner until CRPC development and then significantly decreased after DEC therapy. Subanalysis of CgA at CRPC diagnosis showed a more evident reduction of CgA expression after DEC therapy in patients who also had a high level of CgA as compared to those with a low CgA level (P = .003). Likewise, longer prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival was related to CRPC and high CgA (P = .028).

Methods:   Ninety-eight consecutive patients (90 men; mean age±SD, 65.7±14.2 y) underwent 158 18F-fluoride PET/CT scans for evaluation of skeletal metastatic disease. In order to determine the mean normal bone SUV, initially a 1-cm spheric volume of interest (VOI) was placed over 5 bone sites: T12, L5, sacrum, right iliac bone, and right femur. For each patient, the mean SUVmax for all sites was generated. Afterward, a threshold value of normal bone uptake was established. Subsequently, skeletal tumor burden was determined by generating volumetric data using a whole-body segmentation method. Any SUVmax below the normal threshold was excluded from analysis, as were VOIs not related to metastatic disease. Statistics for the remaining VOIs were then generated and defined as the skeletal metastatic tumor burden by 2 parameters: total lesion fluoride uptake above an SUVmax of 10 (TLF10) and fluoride tumor volume above an SUVmax of 10 (FTV10). TLF10 and FTV10 reproducibility was determined using 2 independent and experienced PET/CT interpreters analyzing a subset of 13 18F-fluoride PET/CT scans.  Results:   Mean (±SD) normal bone SUVmax was 6.62±1.55 for T12, 6.11±1.73 for L5, 4.59±1.74 for sacrum, 5.39±1.72 for right iliac bone, and 3.90±1.57 for right femur. The mean normal SUVmax for all 543 sites was 5.32±0.99. On the basis of these values, an SUVmax threshold of 10 was chosen to exclude normal bone from the volumetric calculations. Semiautomated measurements of TLF10 and FTV10 exhibited high interobserver reproducibility, within ±0.77% and ±3.62% of the interinterpreter average for TLF10 and FTV10, respectively.  Conclusion:   Determination of skeletal tumor burden with 18F-fluoride PET/CT is feasible and highly reproducible. Using an SUVmax threshold of 10 excludes nearly all normal bone activity from volumetric calculations.""","""['Eric M Rohren', 'Elba C Etchebehere', 'John C Araujo', 'Brian P Hobbs', 'Nancy M Swanston', 'Michael Everding', 'Tracy Moody', 'Homer A Macapinlac']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['18F-Fluoride PET in the Assessment of Malignant Bone Disease.', 'Prognostic Factors in Patients Treated with 223Ra: The Role of Skeletal Tumor Burden on Baseline 18F-Fluoride PET/CT in Predicting Overall Survival.', 'Assessment of skeletal tumour burden on 18F-NaF PET/CT using a new quantitative method.', 'Skeletal Tumor Burden on Baseline 18F-Fluoride PET/CT Predicts Bone Marrow Failure After 223Ra Therapy.', 'Newer PET application with an old tracer: role of 18F-NaF skeletal PET/CT in oncologic practice.', 'The Role of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Bone Scans in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Bone Disease from Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative assessment of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone SPECT/CT for assessing bone metastatic burden and its prognostic value in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancers: initial results in a single-center retrospective study.', 'Automated quantification of PET/CT skeletal tumor burden in prostate cancer using artificial intelligence: The PET index.', 'A Retrospective Comparative Study of Sodium Fluoride Na18F-PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the Bone Metastases of Prostate Cancer Using a Volumetric 3-D Radiomic Analysis.', 'Current and future targeted alpha particle therapies for osteosarcoma: Radium-223, actinium-225, and thorium-227.', 'Combined bone scintigraphy and fluorocholine PET/computed tomography predicts response to radium-223 therapy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eight hundred and thirty patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (mean 11.9 μg/l) underwent mpMRI of the prostate at 1.5 Tesla with endorectal coil. The characteristics of all PrCa detected within 2 years after a negative mpMRI were analysed. Primary Gleason grade 4 or any grade 5 PrCa were considered high-grade (HG), Gleason score 3 + 4 intermediate grade (IG) and Gleason score ≤3 + 3 low-grade (LG). Tumour size was considered 'small' when <1 cm on radical prostatectomy specimen or limited to ≤2 cores on prostate biopsy.  Results:   mpMRI was negative in 391 patients (47.1 %). In 124 patients (31.7 %) PrCa was detected within 2 years. Eighty-four (67.7 %) were LG, 22 (17.7 %) IG and 18 (14.5 %) HG. 119 (96.0 %) of the missed PrCa were organ-confined. The negative predictive value was 95.4 % (373/391) for HG PrCa. Among the 18 missed HG PrCa, 15 (83.3 %) were organ-confined and 12 (66.6 %) were small.  Conclusion:   The majority of missed tumours on mpMRI were low grade and organ-confined. In patients with elevated PSA and a negative mpMRI, consideration could be given to continued surveillance rather than immediate biopsy.  Key points:   • The majority of missed prostate cancers were low grade and organ-confined. • In patients with a negative mpMRI a biopsy may be postponed. • mpMRI had a negative predictive value of 95.4 % for high-grade prostate cancer.""","""['Pieter Julien Luc De Visschere', 'Leslie Naesens', 'Louis Libbrecht', 'Charles Van Praet', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Eva Pattyn', 'Geert Villeirs']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Value of 3-Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for improved risk stratification in patients considered for active surveillance.', 'Detecting recurrent prostate Cancer using multiparametric MRI, influence of PSA and Gleason grade.', 'The influence of prostate-specific antigen density on positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer in a repeat biopsy setting.', 'Can Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging?

Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. In addition to direct consequences such as infertility and abortion, there are indications that trichomoniasis favours development of prostate cancer and it has also been associated with increased risk of spreading human immunodeficiency virus and papillomavirus infections. Reports from around the world show that the rate of drug resistance in T. vaginalis is increasing, and therefore new therapeutic approaches have to be developed. Studying molecular biology of T. vaginalis will be quite helpful in identifying new drugable targets. RNAi is a powerful technique which allows biologist to specifically target gene products (i.e. mRNA) helping them in unravelling gene functions and biology of systems. However, due to lack of some parts of the required intrinsic RNAi machinery, the RNAi system is not functional in all orders of life. Here, by using synthetic siRNAs targeting two genes, i.e. α-actinin and cystein protease 12 (cp12), we demonstrate T. vaginalis cells are amenable to RNAi experiments conducted by extrinsic siRNAs. Electroporation of siRNAs targeting α-actinin or cp12 into T. vaginalis cells resulted in, respectively, 48-67% and 33-72% downregulation of the cognate transcripts compared to the T. vaginalis cells received siRNAs targeting GL2 luciferase as a control. This finding is helpful in that it demonstrates the potential of using extrinsically induced RNAi in studies on molecular biology of T. vaginalis such as those aiming at identifying new drug targets.""","""['Roya Ravaee', 'Parimah Ebadi', 'Gholamreza Hatam', 'Arghavan Vafafar', 'Mohammad Mahdi Ghahramani Seno']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Exp Parasitol""","""['Role of α-Actinin 2 in Cytoadherence and Cytotoxicity of Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Recombinant α-actinin subunit antigens of Trichomonas vaginalis as potential vaccine candidates in protecting against trichomoniasis.', 'Comparison between mixed lysate antigen and α-actinin antigen in ELISA for serodiagnosis of trichomoniasis.', 'Drug resistance in the sexually transmitted protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'RNA-Binding Proteins in Trichomonas vaginalis: Atypical Multifunctional Proteins.', 'Identification of Trichomonas vaginalis 5-Nitroimidazole Resistance Targets.', 'Recent advances in the molecular biology of the protist parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Highly Potent 1H-1,2,3-Triazole-Tethered Isatin-Metronidazole Conjugates Against Anaerobic Foodborne, Waterborne, and Sexually-Transmitted Protozoal Parasites.', 'Synthesis and Preliminary Antimicrobial Analysis of Isatin-Ferrocene and Isatin-Ferrocenyl Chalcone Conjugates.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification and gene knock out in the human-infective parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.']"""

The present study was undertaken to gain insights into the prevalence and clinical significance of ligase IV (LIG4) expression in prostate cancer. A total of 11,152 prostate cancer specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for LIG4 expression. Results were compared to follow-up data, ERG status and deletions at PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15. LIG4 expression was predominantly localized in the nucleus of the cells with increased intensities in malignant as compared to benign prostate epithelium. In prostate cancer, LIG4 expression was found in 91% of interpretable tumors, including 12% cancers with weak, 23% with moderate and 56% with strong LIG4 positivity. Strong LIG4 expression was tightly linked to advanced Gleason score (P<0.0001) and positive nodal involvement (P=0.03). There was a remarkable accumulation of strong LIG4 expression in tumors harboring TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletions (P<0.0001 each). High LIG4 expression was also tightly related to early biochemical recurrence when all tumors (P<0.0001) or the subsets of ERG-negative (P=0.0004) or ERG-positive prostate cancers (P=0.006) were analyzed. Multivariate analysis including parameters that are available before surgery demonstrated independent association with biochemical recurrence for advanced Gleason grade on biopsy, high preoperative PSA level, high clinical stage (P<0.0001 each) and for LIG4 immunostaining (P=0.03).

The main objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of prostate cancer patients, the, diagnostic process and the factors that might influence intervals from consultation to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment.  Methods:   We conducted a multicentre, cohort study in seven hospitals in Spain. Patients' characteristics and diagnostic and therapeutic variables were obtained from hospital records and patients' structured interviews from October 2010 to September 2011. We used a multilevel logistic regression model to examine the association between patient care intervals and various variables influencing these intervals (age, BMI, educational level, ECOG, first specialist consultation, tumour stage, PSA, Gleason score, and presence of symptoms) and calculated the odds ratio (OR) and the interquartile range (IQR). To estimate the random inter-hospital variability, we used the median odds ratio (MOR).  Results:   470 patients with prostate cancer were included. Mean age was 67.8 (SD: 7.6) years and 75.4% were physically active. Tumour size was classified as T1 in 41.0% and as T2 in 40% of patients, their median Gleason score was 6.0 (IQR:1.0), and 36.1% had low risk cancer according to the D'Amico classification. The median interval between first consultation and diagnosis was 89 days (IQR:123.5) with no statistically significant variability between centres. Presence of symptoms was associated with a significantly longer interval between first consultation and diagnosis than no symptoms (OR:1.93, 95%CI 1.29-2.89). The median time between diagnosis and first treatment (therapeutic interval) was 75.0 days (IQR:78.0) and significant variability between centres was found (MOR:2.16, 95%CI 1.45-4.87). This interval was shorter in patients with a high PSA value (p = 0.012) and a high Gleason score (p = 0.026).  Conclusions:   Most incident prostate cancer patients in Spain are diagnosed at an early stage of an adenocarcinoma. The period to complete the diagnostic process is approximately three months whereas the therapeutic intervals vary among centres and are shorter for patients with a worse prognosis.

Sulforaphane (SFN), abundant in cruciferous vegetables, exhibited effective resistance to carcinogenesis in a variety of tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether SFN inhibited invasion in human prostate cancer cells via sustained activation of ERK1/2 and downstream signaling by an invasion assay, gelatin zymography and western blot analysis. The results showed that SFN inhibited invasion and we characterized the underlying mechanisms in human DU145 prostate cancer cells. SFN (15 µM) changed cell morphology leading to short‑cell pseudopodia which may suppress tumor migration and invasion. The Transwell assay showed that SFN phosphorylated ERK1/2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significantly inhibited cell invasion, while the effect was reduced by the ERK1/2 blocker PD98059 (25 µM). Furthermore, these effects contributed to the upregulation of E-cadherin and the downregulation of CD44v6 and were eradicated by PD98059. Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography showed that SFN decreased the expression and activity of MMP-2. Thus, SFN inhibited invasion by activating ERK1/2 to upregulate E-cadherin and downregulate CD44v6, thereby reducing MMP-2 expression and activity. E-cadherin is an invasion inhibitor, while CD44v6 and MMP-2 are invasion promoters. Therefore, SFN is a prospective therapeutic agent that may be used to prevent invasion in prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaohui Peng', 'Yan Zhou', 'Hua Tian', 'Gaoxiang Yang', 'Chunliu Li', 'Yang Geng', 'Sai Wu', 'Wei Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Sulforaphane inhibits invasion via activating ERK1/2 signaling in human glioblastoma U87MG and U373MG cells.', 'Sulforaphane-cysteine suppresses invasion via downregulation of galectin-1 in human prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells.', 'Crude extract of Euphorbia formosana inhibits the migration and invasion of DU145 human prostate cancer cells: The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 inhibition via the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Sulforaphane-cysteine induces apoptosis by sustained activation of ERK1/2 and caspase\xa03 in human glioblastoma U373MG and U87MG cells.', 'Shikonin inhibits prostate cancer cells metastasis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression via AKT/mTOR and ROS/ERK1/2 pathways.', 'Sulforaphane: An emergent anti-cancer stem cell agent.', 'Sulforaphane inhibits CD44v6/YAP1/TEAD signaling to suppress the cancer phenotype.', 'SFPQ Promotes Lung Cancer Malignancy via Regulation of CD44 v6 Expression.', 'mTOR inhibitor PP242 increases antitumor activity of sulforaphane by blocking Akt/mTOR pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Sulforaphane: A Broccoli Bioactive Phytocompound with Cancer Preventive Potential.']"""

We aimed to characterize, in a cellular model system in vitro, the potential modulation of aromatase and sex steroid hormone receptors upon exposure to tadalafil (TAD).  Methods:   Human osteoblast-like cells SAOS-2 were chosen as an in vitro model system since osteoblasts are target of steroid hormones. Cells were tested for viability upon TAD exposure, which increased cell proliferation. Then, cells were treated with/without TAD for several times to evaluate potential modulation in PDE5, aromatase (ARO), androgen (AR) and estrogen (ER) receptor expression.  Results:   Osteoblasts express significant levels of both PDE5 mRNA and protein. Exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of TAD (10(-8)-10(-7) M) decreased PDE5 mRNA and protein expression. Also, TAD inhibited ARO mRNA and protein expression leading to an increase in testosterone levels in the supernatants. Interestingly, TAD increased total AR mRNA and protein expression and decreased ERα, with an increased ratio of AR/ER, suggesting preferential androgenic vs estrogenic pathway activation.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate for the first time that TAD decreases ARO expression and increases AR protein expression in human SAOS-2, strongly suggesting a new control of steroid hormones pathway by PDE5i. These findings might represent the first evidence of translational actions of PDE5i on AR, which leads to hypothesize a growing relevance of this molecule in men with prostate cancer long-term treated with TAD for sexual rehabilitation.""","""['A Aversa', 'S Fittipaldi', 'V M Bimonte', 'F Wannenes', 'V Papa', 'D Francomano', 'E A Greco', 'A Lenzi', 'S Migliaccio']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Endocrinol Invest""","""['Tadalafil and Steroid Hormones Interactions in Adipose, Bone and Prostate Tissues: Focus on Translational Perspectives.', 'Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil Modulates Steroid Hormones Signaling in a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Exposure to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors stimulates aromatase expression in human adipocytes in vitro.', 'Effects of aromatase inhibitors on human osteoblast and osteoblast-like cells: a possible androgenic bone protective effects induced by exemestane.', 'Effects of tadalafil on skeletal muscle tissue: exploring interactions and novel mechanisms of action.', 'Ferula communis L.

Hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause and PCa-specific death, and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using Cox models, adjusting for Gleason score and major confounders.  Results:   Out of 263 PCa deceased patients, 81 died because of PCa. Smokers at PCa diagnosis reported increased risks of all-cause (HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) and PCa death (HR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.8), as compared to never smokers. Dose-response effects emerged according to smoking intensity (HRs for >15 cigarettes/day: 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-3.0, for all causes and 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9, for PCa) and duration (HRs for >45 years: 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6, for all causes and 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.5, for PCa). Conversely, former smokers at PCa diagnosis showed no statistically significant higher risks of PCa death. The effects of smoking were consistent in strata of Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Current smoking at PCa diagnosis negatively impacted PCa-specific, long-term survival, regardless of Gleason score. Our findings suggest that smoking could be a modifiable risk factor to improve prognosis of men diagnosed with PCa.""","""['Jerry Polesel', 'Andrea Gini', 'Luigino Dal Maso', 'Carmen Stocco', 'Silvia Birri', 'Martina Taborelli', 'Diego Serraino', 'Antonella Zucchetto']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer survival.', 'Smoking and Risk of Prostate Cancer and Prostate Cancer Death: A Pooled Study.', 'The effect of smoking on prostate cancer survival: a cohort analysis in Barcelona.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco use and prostate cancer mortality and incidence in prospective cohort studies.', 'Tobacco smoking and survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between smoking and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio among prostate cancer survivors: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Status, Chronic Conditions, and Behavioral Risk Factors Among Prostate Cancer Survivors, United States, 2015.', 'Adherence to Mediterranean Diet, Physical Activity and Survival after Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Alpinia zerumbet (Pers.): Food and Medicinal Plant with Potential In Vitro and In Vivo Anti-Cancer Activities.', ""Comment on 'Anthropometric measurements and survival after prostate cancer diagnosis'.""]"""

Trends in death rates can be used to predict progress toward meeting HP2020 targets.  Methods:   We used mortality data from 1975 through 2009 and population estimates and projections to predict deaths for all cancers and the top 23 cancers among men and women by race. We apportioned changes in deaths from population risk and population growth and aging.  Results:   From 1975 to 2009, the number of cancer deaths increased among white and black Americans primarily because of an aging white population and a growing black population. Overall, age-standardized cancer death rates (risk) declined in all groups. From 2007 to 2020, rates are predicted to continue to decrease while counts of deaths are predicted to increase among men (15%) and stabilize among women (increase <10%). Declining death rates are predicted to meet HP2020 targets for cancers of the female breast, lung and bronchus, cervix and uterus, colon and rectum, oral cavity and pharynx, and prostate, but not for melanoma.  Conclusion:   Cancer deaths among women overall are predicted to increase by less than 10%, because of, in part, declines in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer deaths among white women. Increased efforts to promote cancer prevention and improve survival are needed to counter the impact of a growing and aging population on the cancer burden and to meet melanoma target death rates.""","""['Hannah K Weir', 'Trevor D Thompson', 'Ashwini Soman', 'Bjorn Møller', 'Steven Leadbetter', 'Mary C White']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prev Chronic Dis""","""['Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Cancer mortality in the United States by education level and race.', 'CDC National Health Report: leading causes of morbidity and mortality and associated behavioral risk and protective factors--United States, 2005-2013.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Operational Characteristics of Central Cancer Registries that Support the Generation of High-Quality Surveillance Data.', 'PPA1, an energy metabolism initiator, plays an important role in the progression of malignant tumors.', 'A Polymer Prodrug Strategy to Switch from Intravenous to Subcutaneous Cancer Therapy for Irritant/Vesicant Drugs.', 'Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma: A rare but unpleasant event.', 'Adherence to a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern and Cancer Risk in a Prospective Cohort Study.']"""

Additionally, plan parameters extracted from the adapted plans are used to verify the quality of these plans. The methods were tested as a prostate class solution and compared to replanning and to their current clinical practice.  Methods:   The proposed VMAT adaptation is an extension of their previous intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) adaptation. It follows a direct (forward) planning approach: the multileaf collimator (MLC) apertures are corrected in the beam's eye view (BEV) and the monitor units (MUs) are corrected using point dose calculations. All MLC and MU corrections are driven by the positions of four fiducial points only, without need for a full contour set. Quality assurance (QA) of the adapted plans is performed using plan parameters that can be calculated online and that have a relation to the delivered dose or the plan quality. Five potential parameters are studied for this purpose: the number of MU, the equivalent field size (EqFS), the modulation complexity score (MCS), and the components of the  Mcs:   the aperture area variability (AAV) and the leaf sequence variability (LSV). The full adaptation and its separate steps were evaluated in simulation experiments involving a prostate phantom subjected to various interfraction transformations. The efficacy of the current VMAT adaptation was scored by target mean dose (CTVmean), conformity (CI95%), tumor control probability (TCP), and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The impact of the adaptation on the plan parameters (QA) was assessed by comparison with prediction intervals (PI) derived from a statistical model of the typical variation of these parameters in a population of VMAT prostate plans (n = 63). These prediction intervals are the adaptation equivalent of the tolerance tables for couch shifts in the current clinical practice.  Results:   The proposed adaptation of a two-arc VMAT plan resulted in the intended CTVmean (Δ ≤ 3%) and TCP (ΔTCP ≤ 0.001). Moreover, the method assures the intended CI95% (Δ ≤ 11%) resulting in lowered rectal NTCP for all cases. Compared to replanning, their adaptation is faster (13 s vs 10 min) and more intuitive. Compared to the current clinical practice, it has a better protection of the healthy tissue. Compared to IMRT, VMAT is more robust to anatomical variations, but it is also less sensitive to the different correction steps. The observed variations of the plan parameters in their database included a linear dependence on the date of treatment planning and on the target radius. The MCS is not retained as QA metric due to a contrasting behavior of its components (LSV and AAV). If three out of four plan parameters (MU, EqFS, AAV, and LSV) need to lie inside a 50% prediction interval (3/4-50%PI), all adapted plans will be accepted. In contrast, all replanned plans do not meet this loose criterion, mainly because they have no connection to the initially optimized and verified plan.  Conclusions:   A direct (forward) VMAT adaptation performs equally well as (inverse) replanning but is faster and can be extended to real-time adaptation. The prediction intervals for the machine parameters are equivalent to the tolerance tables for couch shifts in the current clinical practice. A 3/4-50%PI QA criterion accepts all the adapted plans but rejects all the replanned plans.""","""['Wouter Crijns', 'Gilles Defraene', 'Hans Van Herck', 'Tom Depuydt', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Frederik Maes', 'Frank Van den Heuvel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric adaptive IMRT driven by fiducial points.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Properties of the anisotropy of dose contributions: A planning study on prostate cases.', 'Effects of collimator angle, couch angle, and starting phase on motion-tracking dynamic conformal arc therapy (4D DCAT).']"""

The potent GRPr antagonist D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 was conjugated to the sarcophagine (3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6] icosane=Sar) derivative 5-(8-methyl-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaaza-bicyclo[6.6.6]icosan-1-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid (MeCOSar) via PEG4 (LE1) and PEG2 (LE2) spacers and radiolabeled with 64Cu2+ with >95% yield and specific activities of about 100 MBq/nmol. Both Cu(II) conjugates have high affinity for GRPr (IC50: natCu-LE1, 1.4±0.1 nM; natCu-LE2, 3.8±0.6 nM). The antagonistic properties of both conjugates were confirmed by Ca2+-flux measurements. Biodistribution studies of Cu-64-LE1 exhibited specific targeting of the tumor (19.6±4.7% IA/g at 1 h p.i.) and GRPr-positive organs. Biodistribution and PET images at 4 and 24 h postinjection showed increasing tumor-to-background ratios with time. This was illustrated by the acquisition of PET images showing high tumor-to-normal tissue contrast. This study demonstrates the high affinity of the MeCOSar-PEGx-bombesin conjugates to GRPr.

In this study, we investigated the impact of CAP on cellular proliferation and consecutive molecular response mechanisms in established prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. PC cells showed a significantly reduced cell growth following CAP treatment as a result of both an immediate increase of intracellular peroxide levels and through the induction of apoptosis indicated by annexin V assay, TUNEL assay, and the evaluation of changes in nuclear morphology. Notably, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) completely neutralized CAP effects by NAC uptake and rapid conversion to glutathione (GSH). Vitamin C could not counteract the CAP induced effects on cell growth. In summary, relatively short treatments with CAP of 10 seconds were sufficient to induce a significant inhibition of cancer proliferation, as observed for the first time in urogenital cancer. Therefore, it is important to understand the mode of CAP related cell death and clarify and optimize CAP as cancer therapy. Increased levels of peroxides can alter redox-regulated signaling pathways and can lead to growth arrest and apoptosis.

However, many of these studies had shortcomings like time-related biases. We aimed to compare the incidence rate of any cancer and some selected cancer sites in metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin users and to reduce some major biases common in observational studies.  Methods:   In a retrospective database study, we used patient data from general practices throughout Germany and the UK. Eighty thousand two hundred and sixty-three patients aged 30-89 years at diagnosis of diabetes were observed for a mean follow-up of 4.8 years after the first antidiabetes medication. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, country, metabolic factors, diabetes duration, medication, and comorbidity, patients who started using metformin were compared with those who started using sulfonylurea (or insulin) (intention-to-treat type analysis), and, additionally, patients with metformin monotherapy were compared with those with sulfonylurea (or insulin) monotherapy. The initial 12 months of follow-up after the first antidiabetes prescription were excluded.  Results:   Four thousand seven hundred seventy-nine (6.0%) incident cases of cancer were identified. Throughout all analyses, hazard ratios were close to the null for comparisons of metformin use with sulfonylurea and insulin use. For example, in intention-to-treat analyses comparing metformin with sulfonylurea use, hazard ratios were 1.05 (95%CI: 0.99-1.12) for any cancer, 1.05 (0.85-1.30) for colorectal, 1.04 (0.82-1.31) for lung, 1.03 (0.81-1.30) for breast, and 0.89 (0.73-1.08) for prostate cancer.

The surgical technique and preliminary data regarding its effectiveness in improving early UC recovery are presented.  Patients and methods:   Between November 2013 and February 2014, 60 patients who underwent RARP at a single high-volume center were prospectively randomized into sling and nonsling groups. Early UC was assessed at 5 days (time of catheter removal), 10 days, and 30 days postoperatively by the daily number of pads used and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) score. Sling-related operative time and urethral erosion were also analyzed. Chi-square and independent sample t tests were used to investigate surgical and functional outcomes between groups.  Results:   Complete data were available for all patients. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) numbers of pads used daily in nonsling and sling groups, respectively, were 1.9 ± 1.2 versus 1.7 ± 1.4 (P = 0.5) at 5 days, 1.8 ± 1.3 versus 1.3 ± 1.3 (P = 0.1) at 10 days, and 1.1 ± 1.2 versus 0.4 ± 0.8 (P = 0.01) at 30 days.

Surgical time did not differ between groups, and in sling patients, no cases of urethral erosion or uroflowmetry suggestive of urinary obstruction were found. Limitations included the small sample size and the lack of assessment of morphologic and urodynamic changes produced by the sling.  Conclusions:   The suburethral autologous sling is technically feasible and may improve early UC recovery after RARP. These preliminary results should be confirmed in a larger sample of patients.""","""['Andrea Cestari', 'Matteo Ferrari', 'Massimo Ghezzi', 'Mattia Sangalli', 'Matteo Zanoni', 'Fabio Fabbri', 'Francesco Sozzi', 'Carolina Lolli', ""Vincenzo Dell'Acqua"", 'Patrizio Rigatti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Re: Retropubic Intracorporeal Placement of a Suburethral Autologous Sling during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy to Improve Early Urinary Continence Recovery: Preliminary Data.', 'Simple vs six-branches autologous suburethral sling during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy to improve early urinary continence recovery: prospective randomized study.', 'Intraoperative Retrograde Perfusion Sphincterometry to Evaluate Efficacy of Autologous Vas Deferens 6-Branch Suburethral Sling to Properly Restore Sphincteric Apparatus During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A Randomized Study of Intraoperative Autologous Retropubic Urethral Sling on Urinary Control after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current techniques to improve outcomes for early return of urinary continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support May Improve Urinary Continence and Quality of Life After Non-nerve-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of Different Invasive Devices for the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'To sling or not to sling?

In present studies, it was demonstrated that microRNA-29a (miR-29a) expressions were significantly lower in prostate cancer (PCa) patient samples, but the role of microRNA-29s in PCa remains unclear. KDM5B was highly expressed in PCa cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a conserved target site for miR-29a in the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of KDM5B. Gain-of-function studies using mature miR-29a were performed to investigate cell proliferation and apoptosis in two PCa cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3). We utilized gene expression analysis and in silico database analysis to identify miR-29a-mediated molecular pathways and targets. We showed that miR-29a significantly suppressed the activity of a lucifarice reporter containing KDM5B-3'UTR, which was not observed in cells transfected with mutated KDM5B-3'UTR. Gene expression data demonstrated that KDM5B expression was lower in noncancerous prostatic cell WPMY-1 than in the four PCa cell lines (LNCaP, 22RV1, PC-3 and DU145). Moreover, the enforced expression of miR-29a in PC-3 and LNCaP cells inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis by repressing the expression of KDM5B. This study revealed that the aberrant expression of miR-29a in PCa cells regulated KDM5B expression levels associated with tumor dissemination.

A prospective, quasi-experimental before-and-after study with a sample of 61 men out of 372 patients referred to the Pelvic Floor Unit from October 2005 to June 2012 was performed. The protocol consisted of 20 sessions of EMG-BFB supervised by a physiotherapist twice a week. The session durations were 30 minutes (118 work/rest cycles of pelvic muscles). Work lasted 3 seconds and rest 7 seconds. Patients were given standards of conduct and questionnaires (International Consultation on Incontinence-Short Form and Incontinence Quality-of-Life Measure) at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. The average age was 64.85 ± 14.34 years; 44.3% (n = 27) had benign prostatic hypertrophy, 41.9% (n = 25) had prostate malignant neoplasm, 86.9% (n = 53) had undergone prostatectomy, 16.4% (n = 10) had undergone abdominal surgery. Abdominal surgery and radical prostatectomy were significantly associated with UI (p < .05). Stress urinary incontinence was the most common type of UI (86.67%), followed by mixed urinary incontinence (8.33%) and urge urinary incontinence (5%). A significant improvement (p < .05) in both International Consultation on Incontinence-Short Form and Incontinence Quality-of-Life Measure questionnaires was observed when making comparisons regarding the results before and after the EMG-BFB treatment protocol.

We have previously shown that miR-193b is hypermethylated in prostate cancer (PC) and suppresses cell growth. It has been suggested that miR-193b targets cyclin D1 in several malignancies. Here, our aim was to determine if miR-193b targets cyclin D1 in prostate cancer. Our data show that miR-193b is commonly methylated in PC samples compared to benign prostate hyperplasia. We found reduced miR-193b expression (P < 0.05) in stage pT3 tumors compared to pT2 tumors in a cohort of prostatectomy specimens. In 22Rv1 PC cells with low endogenous miR-193b expression, the overexpression of miR-193b reduced CCND1 mRNA levels and cyclin D1 protein levels. In addition, the exogenous expression of miR-193b decreased the phosphorylation level of RB, a target of the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 pathway. Moreover, according to a reporter assay, miR-193b targeted the 3'UTR of CCND1 in PC cells and the CCND1 activity was rescued by expressing CCND1 lacking its 3'UTR. Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclin D1 showed that castration-resistant prostate cancers have significantly (P = 0.0237) higher expression of cyclin D1 compared to hormone-naïve cases. Furthermore, the PC cell lines 22Rv1 and VCaP, which express low levels of miR-193b and high levels of CCND1, showed significant growth retardation when treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In contrast, the inhibitor had no effect on the growth of PC-3 and DU145 cells with high miR-193b and low CCND1 expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-193b targets cyclin D1 in prostate cancer.""","""['Kirsi M Kaukoniemi', 'Hanna E Rauhala', 'Mauro Scaravilli', 'Leena Latonen', 'Matti Annala', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Matti Nykter', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Tapio Visakorpi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['MicroRNAs as Potential Predictors of Response to CDK4/6 Inhibitor Treatment.', 'MicroRNA-193b inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells via targeting cyclin D1.', 'miR-193b is an epigenetically regulated putative tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'miR-449a causes Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest and senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Methylation-associated silencing of miR-193b improves the radiotherapy sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells by targeting cyclin D1 in areas with zinc deficiency.', 'Regulation of the Cell Cycle by ncRNAs Affects the Efficiency of CDK4/6 Inhibition.', 'Biomarkers of Response and Resistance to CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Breast Cancer: Hints from Liquid Biopsy and microRNA Exploration.', 'LSGSP: a novel miRNA-disease association prediction model using a Laplacian score of the graphs and space projection federated method.', 'MiR-193b-5p inhibits proliferation and enhances radio-sensitivity by downregulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in tongue cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as Potential Predictors of Response to CDK4/6 Inhibitor Treatment.']"""

For this purpose, the 'Prostate interdisciplinary communication and mapping algorithm for biopsy and pathology' (PIC-MABP) was developed. This study evaluated the accuracy of the PIC-MABP system.  Methods:   PIC-MABP was tested and validated in findings of 10 randomly selected patients from routine clinical practise with 18 histologically proven cancer lesions. Patients received an mpMRI of the prostate prior to prostatectomy. After surgery the prostates were prepared as whole-mount step sections. Cancer lesions, which were found suspicious on mpMRI, were assigned to the according PIC-MABP sectors by a radiologist. MpMRI slides were masked and sent to seven urologists from different centres, providing only the PIC-MABP location of each lesion. Urologists marked the accordant regions. Then mpMRI slides were unmasked, and the correctness of each mark was evaluated.  Results:   One hundred and seventeen of the 126 marks (93%) were correctly assigned. Detection rates differed for lesions >0.5 cc compared with lesions <0.5 cc (p < 0.005): 3/7 (43%) marks were correctly assigned in lesions <0.3 cc, 16/21 (76%) in lesions with 0.3-0.5 cc, and 98/98 (100%) in lesions >0.5 cc.

The authors propose a new replanning algorithm, named gradient maintenance (GM), which does not require the delineation of organs at risk (OARs), and can enhance automation, drastically reducing planning time and improving consistency and throughput of online replanning.  Methods:   The proposed GM algorithm is based on the hypothesis that if the dose gradient toward each OAR in daily anatomy can be maintained the same as that in the original plan, the intended plan quality of the original plan would be preserved in the adaptive plan. The algorithm requires a series of partial concentric rings (PCRs) to be automatically generated around the target toward each OAR on the planning and the daily images. The PCRs are used in the daily optimization objective function. The PCR dose constraints are generated with dose-volume data extracted from the original plan. To demonstrate this idea, GM plans generated using daily images acquired using an in-room CT were compared to regular optimization and image guided radiation therapy repositioning plans for representative prostate and pancreatic cancer cases.  Results:   The adaptive replanning using the GM algorithm, requiring only the target contour from the CT of the day, can be completed within 5 min without using high-power hardware. The obtained adaptive plans were almost as good as the regular optimization plans and were better than the repositioning plans for the cases studied.  Conclusions:   The newly proposed GM replanning algorithm, requiring only target delineation, not full delineation of OARs, substantially increased planning speed for online adaptive replanning. The preliminary results indicate that the GM algorithm may be a solution to improve the ability for automation and may be especially suitable for sites with small-to-medium size targets surrounded by several critical structures.""","""['Ergun E Ahunbay', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technical Note: A fast online adaptive replanning method for VMAT using flattening filter free beams.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Comparison of online IGRT techniques for prostate IMRT treatment: adaptive vs repositioning correction.', 'Fast online replanning for interfraction rotation correction in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Online adaptive radiotherapy and dose delivery accuracy: A retrospective analysis.', 'Dosimetric benefit of MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy in different tumor entities: liver, lung, abdominal lymph nodes, pancreas and prostate.', 'Magnetic resonance linear accelerator technology and adaptive radiation therapy: An overview for clinicians.', 'Clinical implementation of magnetic resonance imaging guided adaptive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'A Fast Online Replanning Algorithm Based on Intensity Field Projection for Adaptive Radiotherapy.']"""

For TZ tumour detection, nADC achieved significantly higher specificity (p=0.003) and accuracy (p=0.004) than ADC for reader 2. For PZ Gleason score >3+3 tumour detection, ADC achieved significantly higher AUC (p=0.003) and specificity (p=0.005) than nADC for reader 1, and significantly higher AUC (p=0.023) than nADC for reader 2. For TZ Gleason score >3+3 tumour detection, ADC achieved significantly higher specificity (p=0.019) than nADC for reader 1.  Conclusion:   In contrast to prior studies performing unblinded evaluations, ADC was observed to outperform nADC overall for two independent observers blinded to the histopathology findings. Therefore, although strategies to improve the utility of ADC measurements in prostate cancer assessment merit continued investigation, caution is warranted when applying normalisation to improve diagnostic performance in clinical practice.""","""['A B Rosenkrantz', 'V Khalef', 'W Xu', 'J S Babb', 'S S Taneja', 'A M Doshi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Radiol""","""['Prostate cancer vs. post-biopsy hemorrhage: diagnosis with T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: revisiting the role of multiparametric MRI at 3 T.', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Values of the Benign Central Zone of the Prostate: Comparison With Low- and High-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'The utility of quantitative ADC values for differentiating high-risk from low-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A literature review of the association between diffusion-weighted MRI derived apparent diffusion coefficient and tumour aggressiveness in pelvic cancer.', 'Nomogram Models for Distinguishing Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate From Prostatic Acinar Adenocarcinoma Based on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Utility of quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient measurements and normalized apparent diffusion coefficient ratios in the diagnosis of clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate: should we use quantitative metrics to better characterize focal lesions originating in the peripheral zone?', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging is a sensitive biomarker of response to biologic therapy in enthesitis-related arthritis.', 'Interobserver Reproducibility of the PI-RADS Version 2 Lexicon: A Multicenter Study of Six Experienced Prostate Radiologists.']"""

Methods:   Patients who underwent surgery for RCC or PCa between 2006 and 2012 were offered enrollment in respective prospective cancer registries that included baseline and annual QoL assessments. We identified 201 RCC patients and 616 PCa patients who completed a baseline QoL survey and were mailed annual QoL surveys [RCC: SF-36, FACT-G (73 questions), PCa: EPIC, IIEF, Max-PC (80 questions)]. We compared patient characteristics between responders and non-responders using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and a Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables.  Results:   The overall response rates for the PCa and RCC groups were 63 and 48% (p < 0.001), respectively. This difference in response rates remained when we limited analysis to only those with early stage disease (pT2 for PCa and pT1 RCC, 62% vs. 52%; p = 0.03). PCa characteristics associated with response included older age (64.1 vs 62.6 years, p = 0.032) and robotic versus open surgery (56% vs 44%; p = 0.009). There were no characteristics that were associated with response in RCC patients.  Conclusions:   Surgically treated PCa patients have higher QoL mail-based survey response rates compared to patients treated surgically for RCC.

Previous studies have demonstrated that alterations in YAP activity may result in tumourigenesis of the prostate. With androgen deprivation therapies becoming progressively ineffective, often leading to life‑threatening androgen‑resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The present study aimed to analyse the role of YAP in prostate cancer (PCa), particularly in CRPC. YAP protein was detected using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis in different prostatic tissues. In addition, three specific RNA interference vectors targeting the human YAP gene were synthesised, and PC‑3 cells with a stable inhibition of YAP were obtained by transfection. MTT, flow cytometry, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays were used to analyse the effects of YAP inhibition on the proliferation and apoptosis of PC‑3 cells. The frequency of cells that were positive for YAP protein in PCa (78.13%) was significantly higher, compared with para‑PCa (26.67%; P=0.007) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (0%; P=0.002). The frequency of cells, which were positive for the expression of YAP exhibited a positive correlation (P=0.008) with the Gleason score, the tumour‑node‑metastasis staging (P=0.033) and the level of prostate specific antigens (P=0.0032) in PCa. The proliferative capacity of the transfected group was significantly lower, compared with the negative control group (P=0.022). The cell‑cycle of the transfected group was arrested in the G1 stage, which was detected using flow cytometry, and there was a significant increase in the apoptosis of cells in the transfected group (P=0.002). The mRNA and protein levels of TEA domain family member 1 were inhibited in the transfected group (P=0.001 and P=0.00, respectively). Therefore, it was concluded that gene transcription and protein expression of YAP may be involved in the development of PCa, particularly CRPC, and may be a novel biomarker for investigation of the occurrence and progression of CRPC.

We hypothesized that they would benefit from radiation therapy.  Methods:   We utilized the Survival, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database for patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 2004 to 2008. Patients treated surgically or with brachytherapy were excluded. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models.

Results:   A total of 75,539 nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients were identified who received either radiotherapy or no local treatment. Median age was 70 years. Median follow-up of alive subjects was 60 months, with an interquartile range of 47 to 77 months. Estimated 4-year overall survival of entire population was 88%. Significant prognostic variables for overall survival on multivariate analysis included age, grade, PSA level, T stage, and use of radiation therapy. Use of radiation therapy was the most powerful predictor of both cause-specific and overall survival (HR=0.41 and 0.46, respectively, P<0.001). The benefit conferred by local treatment was seen even in subjects with PSA≥75 ng/mL. Four-year cancer-specific survival was 93.8% in those receiving radiation treatments versus 76.5% in those who did not receive any local treatment.

In this paper, we have focused on the mechanism(s) associated with ring-DIM-mediated cell death, and on identifying the specific intracellular target(s) of these compounds. The 4,4'- and 7,7'-dichloroDIMs and 4,4'- and 7,7'-dibromoDIMs induced the death of LNCaP, C42B and DU145 prostate cancer cells, but not that of immortalized normal human prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) cells. Ring-DIMs caused the early loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and decreased mitochondrial ATP generation in prostate cancer cells. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, inhibited ring-DIM-mediated cell death, and salubrinal, an inhibitor of ER stress, inhibited cell death mediated only by 4,4'-dihaloDIMs. We found that although salubrinal did not inhibit the onset of ER stress, it prevented 4,4'-dibromoDIM mediated loss of MMP. Salubrinal potentiated cell death in response to 7,7'-dihaloDIMs and DIM, and this effect concurred with increased loss of MMP. Using in silico 3-D docking affinity analysis, we identified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) as a potential direct target for the most toxic ring-DIM, 4,4'-dibromoDIM. An inhibitor of CaMKII, KN93, but not its inactive analog KN92, abrogated cell death mediated by 4,4'-dibromoDIM. The ring-DIMs induced ER stress and autophagy, but these processes were not necessary for ring-DIM-mediated cell death. Inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine or by LC3B gene silencing sensitized LNCaP and C42B, but not ATG5-deficient DU145 cells to ring-DIM- and DIM-mediated cell death.

Here, PI3K pathway activation was assessed, in clinical tissue from 1,021 men with prostate cancers, using multiple pathway nodes that include PTEN, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), and stathmin. Based on these markers, a 9-point score of PI3K activation was created using the combined intensity of the 4-markers and analyzed its association with proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and androgen receptor (AR) status, as well as pathologic features and cancer-specific outcomes. In addition, the PI3K activation score was compared with mRNA expression profiling data for a large subset of men. Interestingly, those tumors with higher PI3K activation scores also had higher Gleason grade (P = 0.006), increased AR (r = 0.37; P < 0.001) and Ki67 (r = 0.24; P < 0.001), and decreased TUNEL (r = -0.12; P = 0.003). Although the PI3K activation score was not associated with an increased risk of lethal outcome, a significant interaction between lethal outcome, Gleason and high PI3K score (P = 0.03) was observed. Finally, enrichment of PI3K-specific pathways was found in the mRNA expression patterns differentiating the low and high PI3K activation scores; thus, the 4-marker IHC score of PI3K pathway activity correlates with features of PI3K activation.

Materials and methods:   All patients undergoing diagnostics for cancer at our Hospital during 2011 were included in the study (n=139). Plasma tumor M2-PK concentration was analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   The different cancer types found in the study were: 60 colorectal, 43 breast, 8 lung, 5 prostatic, 4 ovarian and the remaining 19 cases were other uncommon tumor types. Most tumors had high concentrations of tumor M2-PK; prostatic, pharyngeal and testicular tumors had levels lower than or near the cut-off. Plasma tumor M2-PK levels were significantly higher in patients with distant metastases and stage IV by TNM.  Conclusion:   Plasma tumor M2-PK is not a specific marker for CRC and is elevated in many other types of cancers, including breast, lung, ovarian, and thyroid. Small amounts are found in prostatic, pharyngeal and testicular tumors.""","""['Aurora Muñoz-Colmenero', 'Antonio Fernández-Suárez', 'Daniel Fatela-Cantillo', 'Esther Ocaña-Pérez', 'José L Domínguez-Jiménez', 'José M Díaz-Iglesias']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['A comparison of tumour M2-PK with carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 in patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal metastases.', 'Tumor type M2-pyruvate-kinase levels in pleural fluid versus plasma in cancer patients: a further tool to define the need for invasive procedures.', 'Quantitative detection of tumor M2-pyruvate kinase in plasma of patients with lung cancer in comparison to other lung diseases.', 'Tumour M2-pyruvate kinase: a gastrointestinal cancer marker.', 'Current status of tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) as a biomarker of gastrointestinal malignancy.', 'Evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum TuM2-PK, NSE, and ProGRP in small cell lung cancer.', 'Shikonin induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell apoptosis by suppressing PKM2/PHD3/HIF-1α signaling pathway.', 'The roles of glycolysis in osteosarcoma.', 'Assessment of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using plasma tumour M2-pyruvate kinase test.', 'The Role of PKM2 in the Regulation of Mitochondrial Function: Focus on Mitochondrial Metabolism, Oxidative Stress, Dynamic, and Apoptosis.

SHOT-RNAs are not abundantly present in ER(-) breast cancer, AR(-) prostate cancer, or other examined cancer cell lines from other tissues. ER-dependent accumulation of SHOT-RNAs is not limited to a cell culture system, but it also occurs in luminal-type breast cancer patient tissues.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic compound, on cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and colony formation in the PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The effect of FA on cell viability was determined via a 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) method. Total RNA was isolated with Tri Reagent. Expression of 84 genes for both cell cycle and apoptosis separately was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Protein expressions were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, apoptotic effects of FA were observed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Effects of FA on cell invasion and colony formation were determined using Matrigel chamber and colony assay, respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) dose of FA was found to be 300 μM in PC-3 cells and 500 μM in LNCaP cells. According to RT-PCR results, it was observed that FA inhibited cell proliferation by increasing the gene expressions of ATR, ATM, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, E2F4, RB1, and TP53 and decreasing the gene expressions of CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 in PC-3 cells. On the other hand, it was seen that FA suppressed cell proliferation by increasing in the gene expressions of CASP1, CASP2, CASP8, CYCS, FAS, FASLG, and TRADD and decreasing in the gene expressions of BCL2 and XIAP in LNCaP cells. In this study, protein expression of CDK4 and BCL2 genes significantly decreased in these cells. It could induce apoptosis in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Also, it was observed that FA suppressed the invasion in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Moreover, it suppressed the colony formation.

CaP knowledge, intention to screen, and preferences were assessed before and after exposure to DSI using a convenience sample of 120 AA men aged 40 years and above. Participants interested in screening were referred to healthcare providers through a community-based patient navigator to obtain prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. We followed up 3 months after to determine if participants screened for CaP. CaP knowledge increased following exposure to both DSI in equivalent proportions. While similar proportions of men ultimately intended on having a PSA test following both DSI, bivariate analysis revealed that the culturally tailored DSI demonstrated a statistically significant increase in intention to screen. Participants' degree of certainty in their decision-making process with regard to CaP screening increased following the culturally tailored DSI (p < .001).

Methods and methods:   First 200 patients treated with (125)I PPB monotherapy (145 Gy) at a single institution were assessed. Postimplant dosimetry (PID) using CT was evaluated for whole prostate (global) and 12 sectors, assessing minimum dose to 90% of prostate (D90) and dose to 0.1 cm(3) of rectum (D0.1cc). Global and sector PID results were evaluated to investigate changes in D90 with case number. Urinary and bowel PROMs were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire. The correlation between global and individual sector PID and urinary/bowel PROMs was also evaluated.  Results:   Linear regression confirmed a significant improvement in global D90 with case number (r(2) = 0.20; p = 0.001) at a rate of 0.11 Gy/case. Postimplant D90 of base sectors increased at a rate of 0.11-0.15 Gy/case (p = 0.0001) and matched global improvement.

Methods:   Male members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California who were aged ≥40 years and had no history of prostate cancer (N = 15,326) were passively followed through electronic health plan files from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2012 (N = 1,539,469). The rates of PSA testing, elevated PSA tests, prostate biopsies, prostate cancer treatment (surgery and radiation), and urology visits were calculated per year among eligible men and stratified by age group.  Results:   A 59% decrease in PSA screening occurred among men aged ≥75 years beginning in 2008, followed by 49% in ages 65-74, 20% in ages 50-64, and 33% in ages 40-49 years in 2009. However, the number of elevated PSA tests remained largely unchanged in all groups except in men aged ≥75 years (45% decrease). Prostate biopsy rates and urology visits remained consistent among elderly men.  Conclusion:   Among men in this managed care setting, although there was a sharp decline in PSA testing among men aged ≥75 years after 2008, prostate biopsy rates remained constant, and subsequent prostate cancer treatment remained highest among men in this age group. These results suggest that the guidelines recommending against PSA and the subsequent provider-targeted interventions implemented in this system resulted in decreased screening across age groups and potentially led to more discriminant screening among those aged ≥75 years.""","""['Lauren P Wallner', 'Jin-Wen Y Hsu', 'Ronald K Loo', 'Darryl E Palmer-Toy', 'Joanne E Schottinger', 'Steven J Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Reply: To PMID 26123517.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Trends in Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening, Prostate Biopsies, Urology Visits, and Prostate Cancer Treatments from 2000 to 2012.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Comparative efficiency of prostate-specific antigen screening strategies for prostate cancer detection.', 'Changes in serum prostate-specific antigen levels and the identification of prostate cancer in a large managed care population.', 'The use of prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer screening: a managed care perspective.', 'Approach to primary care follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.', 'The use of electronic health records to inform cancer surveillance efforts: a scoping review and test of indicators for public health surveillance of cancer prevention and control.', 'An Up-to-date Assessment of US Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Stage and Race: A Novel Approach Combining Multiple Imputation with Age and Delay Adjustment.', 'A continuous fall of PSA use for prostate cancer screening among Brazilian doctors since 2001.

The use of in vitro models gives excellent control of the cellular environment, crucial in the understanding of enzyme kinetics. The increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells has been well studied with HP (13)C NMR. Unfortunately, the equally important metabolic step of lactate transport out of the cell remains undetected, because intracellular and extracellular lactate are measured as a single resonance. Furthermore, typical experiments must be performed using tens of millions of cells, a large amount which can lead to a costly and sometimes highly challenging growing procedure. We present a relatively simple set-up that requires as little as two million cells with the spectral resolution to separate the intracellular and extracellular lactate resonances. The set-up is tested with suspensions of prostate cancer carcinoma cells (PC3) in combination with HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate. We obtained reproducible pyruvate to lactate label fluxes of 1.2 and 1.7 nmol/s per million cells at 2.5 and 5.0 mM pyruvate concentrations. The existence of a 3-Hz chemical shift difference between intracellular and extracellular lactate enabled us to determine the lactate transport rates in PC3.

Methods:   We studied a prospective cohort of cancer patients aged ≥ 70 years and referred to geriatric oncology clinics between 2007 and 2012. A multidimensional geriatric assessment was performed before choosing the cancer-treatment strategy. Clinical depression was diagnosed by senior geriatricians by a semi-structured interview. It encompassed criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) and of the International Classification of Diseases (10th edition). Multivariate logistic regression was performed.  Results:   Of 1121 consecutive patients, 1092 had available data (mean age, 80.4 years; women, 48.8%; metastases, 51.3%; cancer location: colorectal 21.1%, breast 16.8%, kidney, bladder or urinary tract 14.0%, and prostate 11.4%). The overall prevalence of clinical depression was 28.4% (95% confidence interval, 25.7-31.2). Factors independently associated with clinical depression by multivariate analysis adjusting for all following factors plus gender, and metastasis were impaired mobility (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.35; 1.59-3.46), impaired functional status defined as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ≥ 2 (aOR, 2.39; 1.66-3.43) or as activities of daily living < 6 (aOR, 2.43; 1.73-3.41), inpatient status (aOR, 1.68; 1.20-2.37), inadequate social support (aOR, 1.66; 1.16-2.37), cognitive impairment (aOR, 1.76; 1.24-2.49), polypharmacy defined as five or more non-antidepressant drugs (aOR, 1.65; 1.14-2.38), multimorbidity (aOR additional CIRS-G point , 1.08; 1.04-1.12), and cancer-related pain (aOR, 1.76; 1.26-2.46).

The nomogram allows improved decision making with curative intent within this heterogeneous patient cohort, which is important, as RP in patients with clinical HRPCa remains a topic of controversy.  Methods:   We externally validated the nomogram in 1,669 men with clinical HRPCa who underwent RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection between 1992 and 2011. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate 5- and 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was performed. To investigate the SCD model׳s performance, the previously reported regression coefficients of the SCD nomogram were applied. Within loess calibration plots, the extent of overestimation or underestimation was graphically explored. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical value of the SCD nomogram was performed.  Results:   Overall, 49% of men showed SCD after RP. The 5- and 10-year biochemical recurrence rates for men with SCD were 66% and 56%, respectively, vs. 32% and 20%, respectively, for men without SCD (log-rank test P<0.001). External validation demonstrated comparable accuracy in relation to accuracy derived from internal validation (68.1% vs. 72.0%). Calibration was suboptimal, showing a tendency to underestimate SCD probability. In DCA, the nomogram׳s usage was associated with a clinical net benefit relative to both treating all and none.  Conclusions:   Within our cohort, the nomogram׳s use was associated with a clinical net benefit according to DCA. However, one-third of men were falsely classified as having SCD or non-SCD.

Sample:   51 PCSs randomized to one year of resistance and impact training or a stretching control group.  Methods:   The authors investigated changes in body composition and cancer-related biomarkers, and the influence of age and fat loss on changes in biomarkers.  Main research variables:   Body composition (total fat, trunk fat, and lean mass), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and sex hormone-binding globulin.  Findings:   In the 36 PCSs with baseline and 12-month data, total fat (p = 0.02) and trunk fat (p = 0.06) mass decreased in the training group compared to gains in controls. Loss of total and trunk fat each mediated the relationship between groups and one-year change in insulin (p < 0.05). Age moderated the insulin response to exercise where insulin reductions were smaller with increasing age (p = 0.03).

Materials and methods:   Prostates were obtained from 194 deceased men 45 years or older who did not have a history of prostate cancer. Serial sections and histological examinations of the prostate were performed. The MnSOD genotypes of the specimens were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.  Results:   Of the 194 men, 31 and 26 had clinically insignificant and significant prostate cancer. Clinically significant cancer comprised 29% and 58% of the cancers in men <70 and >70 years old, respectively. The age-specific proportion of significant cancer significantly increased with the advance of age (p<0.001). MnSOD AA, as compared with the other genotypes (VA and VV together), was associated with significant prostate cancer across all ages, odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-5.49, and in men older than 69 years (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.51-15.8), but not in men younger than 70 years. The genotype was not associated with clinically insignificant cancer regardless of age.

In the prostate, ERβ is highly expressed in the epithelium and appears to participate in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Evidence shows that ERβ is decreased in malignant prostate, suggesting that it plays an important role in protecting this tissue. Despite the relationship between reductions in ERβ and abnormal growth of the gland, little is known about the age-dependent variation of this receptor. Therefore, we aimed to investigate ERβ expression in the prostatic lobes of aging Wistar rats (3 to 24 months). Histopathological alterations, including hyperplasia, intraluminal concretions, nuclear atypia and prostate intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN), were observed in the prostates of aging rats. Epithelial proliferation led to cribriform architecture in some acini, especially in the ventral prostate (VP). In the VP, areas of epithelial atrophy were also observed. Furthermore, in the lateral prostate, there was frequent prostatitis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of ERβ is reduced in specific areas related to PIN, atrophic abnormalities and cellular atypia in the prostate epithelium of senile rats. Corroborating the involvement of the receptor with proliferative activity, the punctual reduction in ERβ paralleled the increase in cell proliferation especially in areas of PIN and nuclear atypies. The decrease in ERβ reactivity occurred in a hormonal milieu characterized by a constant concentration of estradiol and decreased plasmatic and tissue DHT. This paper is a pioneering study that reveals focal ERβ reduction in the prostate of aging rats and indicates a potential disorder in the ERβ pathway. These data corroborate previous data from humans and dogs that silencing of this receptor may be associated with premalignant or malignant conditions in the prostate.""","""['Mônica Morais-Santos', 'Aryane E B Nunes', 'André G Oliveira', 'Júnia Dayrell Moura-Cordeiro', 'Germán A B Mahecha', 'Maria Christina W Avellar', 'Cleida A Oliveira']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Profile of cell proliferation and apoptosis activated by the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the prostate of aging rats.', 'Essential role for estrogen receptor beta in stromal-epithelial regulation of prostatic hyperplasia.', 'High-fat diet obesity associated with insulin resistance increases cell proliferation, estrogen receptor, and PI3K proteins in rat ventral prostate.', 'The role of Eralpha and ERbeta in the prostate: insights from genetic models and isoform-selective ligands.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Current evidence for the involvement of sex steroid receptors and sex hormones in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Estrogen receptor β, a regulator of androgen receptor signaling in the mouse ventral prostate.', 'Comprehensive assessment of estrogen receptor beta antibodies in cancer cell line models and tissue reveals critical limitations in reagent specificity.']"""

Previous studies showed that androgen receptor (AR) is crucially involved in regulation of metabolism in prostate cancer (PCa) cells throughout the transition from early stage, androgen-sensitive PCa to androgen-independent CRPC. AR achieves such metabolic rewiring directively either via its transcriptional activity or via interactions with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, due to the heterogeneous expression and activity status of AR in PCa cells, it remains a challenge to investigate the links between AR status and metabolic alterations. To this end, we compared the proteomes of three pairs of androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-independent (AI) PCa cell lines, namely, PC3-AR(+)/PC3, 22Rv1/Du145, and LNCaP/C42B, using an iTRAQ labeling approach. Our results revealed that most of the differentially expressed proteins between each pair function in metabolism, indicating a metabolic shift between AS and AI cells, as further validated by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based quantification of nucleotides and relative comparison of fatty acids between these cell lines. Furthermore, increased adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK1) in AS relative to AI cells may result in activation of AMPK, representing a major regulatory factor involved in the observed metabolic shift in PCa cells.""","""['Qingbo Shu', 'Tanxi Cai', 'Xiulan Chen', 'Helen He Zhu', 'Peng Xue', 'Nali Zhu', 'Zhensheng Xie', 'Shasha Wei', 'Qing Zhang', 'Lili Niu', 'Wei-Qiang Gao', 'Fuquan Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Differential proteome expression analysis of androgen-dependent and -independent pathways in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Expression profiles and functional associations of endogenous androgen receptor and caveolin-1 in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: a model of integration of genomic and non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor in cell lines model.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'Quantitative Proteomics Using Isobaric Labeling: A Practical Guide.', 'Proteomics reveals the function reverse of MPSSS-treated prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts to suppress PC-3 cell viability via the FoxO pathway.', 'Prostate Cancer Proliferation Is Affected by the Subcellular Localization of MCT2 and Accompanied by Significant Peroxisomal Alterations.', 'Attenuation of Equine Lentivirus Alters Mitochondrial Protein Expression Profile from Inflammation to Apoptosis.']"""

NPC patients with low PSCA expression had a consistently poor metastasis-free survival (p = 0.003). Knockdown and overexpression of PSCA respectively enhanced and impaired the migration and invasion in vitro and the lung metastasis in vivo of NPC cells. Mechanistically, the enhancement of NPC metastasis by knocking down PSCA probably involved epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by up-regulating N-cadherin and ZEB1/2 and by activating RhoA.

MTOR inhibition suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by senescent cells. Rapamycin reduced IL6 and other cytokine mRNA levels, but selectively suppressed translation of the membrane-bound cytokine IL1A. Reduced IL1A diminished NF-κB transcriptional activity, which controls much of the SASP; exogenous IL1A restored IL6 secretion to rapamycin-treated cells.

Aleksandra Luszczynska's institutional affiliation was incorrectly set as Warsaw School of Social Sciences and Humanities. It should have been University of Social Sciences and Humanities. All versions of this article have been corrected.]  Objective:   Radical prostatectomy, a standard treatment for localized prostate cancer, is often followed by a recommendation to initiate and maintain pelvic floor exercise (PFE), to control postsurgery urinary incontinence. Previous studies showed that planning facilitated the uptake and maintenance of a new behavior. Whereas individual planning addresses the setting of plans by 1 person, dyadic planning refers to creating plans together with a partner on when, where, and how the individual target person will perform a behavior. Individual and dyadic planning of PFE, their development over time, and their associations with PFE were investigated.  Research method:   In a correlational study, 175 prostate-cancer patients provided data at 1, 3, 5, and 7 months following the onset of incontinence. Individual planning of PFE by patients and dyadic planning of PFE between patients and their partners, PFE, and incontinence were assessed by patients' self-reports.  Results:   Two-level models with repeated assessments nested in individuals revealed stable levels of individual planning of PFE over time in patients with higher incontinence severity, whereas patients with receding incontinence showed decreases. Independent of incontinence severity, a curvilinear increase followed by a decrease of dyadic planning of PFE across time emerged. Sequential associations of both planning strategies with PFE were found. Whereas individual planning was steadily associated with PFE, associations between dyadic planning and PFE were nonsignificant in the beginning, but increased over time.  Conclusions:   Findings point to the importance of individual planning for the adoption and maintenance of PFE, with dyadic planning being relevant for PFE maintenance only.""","""['Jan Keller', 'Silke Burkert', 'Amelie U Wiedemann', 'Aleksandra Luszczynska', 'Mark Schrader', 'Nina Knoll']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Rehabil Psychol""","""['Correction to Keller et al.

Therefore, DAB2 has always been regarded as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the role of DAB2 in tumor progression and metastasis remains unclear. In this study, DAB2 expression was upregulated along with human prostate cancer (PCa) progression. DAB2 overexpression or knockdown effects in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were verified to address the biological functions of DAB2 in PCa progression and metastasis. LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were generated from human PCa cells with low and high metastatic potentials, respectively. The results showed that DAB2 shRNA knockdown can inhibit the migratory and invasive abilities of PC3 cells, as well as the tumorigenicity, whereas DAB2 overexpression enhanced LNCaP cell migration and invasion. Further investigation showed that DAB2 regulated the cell migration associated genes in PC3 cells, and the differential DAB2 expression between LNCaP and PC3 cells was partly regulated by histone 4 acetylation.

We investigated factors associated with cancer-related financial stress and strain in breast and prostate cancer survivors in Ireland, which has a complex mixed public-private healthcare system.  Methods:   Postal questionnaires were distributed to 1373 people diagnosed with cancer 3-24 months previously identified from the National Cancer Registry Ireland. Outcomes were cancer-related financial stress (impact of cancer diagnosis on household ability to make ends meet) and financial strain (concerns about household financial situation since cancer diagnosis). Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) for factors associated with cancer-related financial stress and strain.  Results:   Seven hundred forty survivors participated (response rate = 54 %). Of the respondents, 48 % reported cancer-related financial stress and 32 % cancer-related financial strain. Compared to those employed at diagnosis, risk of cancer-related financial stress was significantly lower in those not working (RR = 0.71, 95 % CI 0.58-0.86) or retired (RR = 0.48, 95 % CI 0.34-0.68). It was significantly higher in those who had dependents; experienced financial stress pre-diagnosis; had a mortgage/personal loans; had higher direct medical out-of-pocket costs; and had increased household bills post-diagnosis. For cancer-related financial strain, significant associations were found with dependents, pre-diagnosis employment status and pre-diagnosis financial stress; risk was lower in those with higher direct medical out-of-pocket costs.  Conclusions:   Cancer-related financial stress and strain are common. Pre-diagnosis employment status and financial circumstances are important predictors of post-diagnosis financial wellbeing. These findings could inform development of tools to identify patients/survivors most in need of financial advice and support.""","""['Linda Sharp', 'Aileen Timmons']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Financial Impact of Colorectal Cancer and Its Consequences: Associations Between Cancer-Related Financial Stress and Strain and Health-Related Quality of Life.', 'Cancer-related financial hardship among head and neck cancer survivors: Risk factors and associations with health-related quality of life.', 'Financial hardship associated with colorectal cancer survivorship: The role of asset depletion and debt accumulation.', 'Costs of cancer along the care continuum: What we can expect based on recent literature.', 'Financial Hardship and the Economic Effect of Childhood Cancer Survivorship.', 'Trends in emotional functioning and psychosocial wellbeing in breast cancer survivors: a prospective cohort study using patient-reported outcome measures.', 'Occupational and Financial Setbacks in Caregivers of People with Colorectal Cancer: Considerations for Caregiver-Reported Outcomes.', 'The economic impact of cancer diagnosis to individuals and their families: a systematic review.', 'Identifying missing links in the conceptualization of financial toxicity: a qualitative study.', 'Patient-Reported Financial Distress in Cancer: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors in Universal Healthcare Systems.']"""

Methods:   From January 2012 to January 2014, 169 patients with a median of 2 negative conventional PBX and/or initially or consistently elevated prostate-specific antigen levels were prospectively included and underwent 3 T mpMRI. Real-time MRI-US fusion scan was used to biopsy the mpMRI-targeted lesions (n = 316). Scanning by mpUS, including B-mode, power Doppler, strain elastography, and contrast-enhanced US was performed to further characterize those lesions and to score by US modalities resulting in an mpUS score. Afterward, a conventional 10-core PBX was performed. PCa detection based on the results of targeted and conventional PBX was estimated. Performances of single US modalities were analyzed. The mpUS score was also investigated for PCa and PI-RADS score prediction.  Results:   Among 169 patients, 71 PCa (42%) were detected. From these 71 cases, clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥7) were detected exclusively by MRI-US fusion in 31 from 46 cases (67.4%). The highest sensitivity was observed in contrast-enhanced US (85%) and elastography (80%). The mpUS score predicts PCa and PI-RADS score with an overall accuracy of 86% and 80%, respectively.

The 2 specialties often disagree about postprostatectomy adjuvant treatment recommendations.  Materials and methods:   Twenty-six radiation oncologists and 20 urologists with genitourinary oncology expertise reviewed de-identified clinical results from 11 patients after radical prostatectomy and made adjuvant treatment recommendations. The same cases were later randomized and reassigned, and treatment recommendations were made using the clinical information and GC test results together.  Results:   Using clinical information alone, observation was recommended in 42% of decisions made by urologists vs 23% by radiation oncologists (P < .0001). The GC test results altered 35% and 45% of treatment recommendations made by radiation oncologists and urologists, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed GC risk was the strongest factor influencing treatment recommendations by both specialties, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.26-7.70) and 6.51 (95% CI, 4.29-9.88) for radiation oncologists and urologists, respectively. GC results indicating high metastatic risk resulted in intensification of treatment, whereas low metastatic risk resulted in less aggressive recommendations.

To improve survival, strategies in England have focused on early presentation (reducing delay to improve stage at diagnosis), improving quality of care and ensuring equity throughout the patient pathway. We assessed whether primary care characteristics were associated with later stage cancer at diagnosis (stages 3/4 versus 1/2) for female breast, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data obtained from the National Cancer Registration Service, Quality Outcomes Framework, GP survey and GP workforce census, linked by practice code. Risk differences (RD) were calculated by primary care characteristics using a generalised linear model, accounting for patient clustering within practices. Models were adjusted for age, sex and an area-based deprivation measure.  Results:   For female breast cancer, being with a practice with a higher two week wait (TWW) referral rate (RD -1.8% (95 % CI -0.5% to -3.2%) p = 0.003) and a higher TWW detection rate (RD -1.7% (95 % CI -0.3% to -3.0%) p = 0.003) was associated with a lower proportion diagnosed later. Being at a practice where people thought it less easy to book at appointment was associated with a higher percentage diagnosed later (RD 1.8% (95 % CI 0.2% to 3.4%) p = 0.03). For lung cancer, being at practices with higher TWW referral rates was associated with lower proportion advanced (RD-3.6% (95 % CI -1.8%, -5.5%) p < 0.001) whereas being at practices with more patients per GP was associated with higher proportion advanced (RD1.8% (95 % CI 0.2, 3.4) p = 0.01). A higher rate of gastrointestinal investigations was associated with a lower proportion of later stage colorectal cancers (RD -2.0% (95 % CI -0.6% to -3.6%) p = 0.01). No organisational characteristics were associated with prostate cancer stage.  Conclusion:   Easier access to primary care, faster referral and more investigation for gastrointestinal symptoms could reduce the proportion of people diagnosed later for female breast, lung and colorectal, but not prostate cancer.

Methods:   Data from 120 patients with T3-T4N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with IMRT were analyzed. NA-ADT with a median duration of 6 months was provided in all cases. Seventy-eight Gy, at 2 Gy per fraction, was delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles. Adjuvant ADT (A-ADT) was not provided for any patient following the completion of IMRT. Salvage ADT (S-ADT) commenced when PSA values >4 ng/ml.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 97 months. S-ADT was initiated in 39 patients. The median PSA value at the initiation of S-ADT was 5.7 ng/ml. The 8-year biochemical relapse-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, overall survival and S-ADT-free rates were 53.2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 43.4, 62.1], 96.6 % (95 % CI 91.2, 98.7), 89.1 % (95 % CI 81.5, 93.7) and 66.6 % (95 % CI 60, 74.6), respectively.

Conclusions:   High-dose IMRT, combined with NA-ADT for LAPC, was associated with favorable long-term disease-specific and overall survival outcomes, despite non-provision of A-ADT under the early S-ADT provision policy.

The expression of Ring1 was evaluated using Western blot analysis in 8 paired fresh HCC tissues and immunohistochemistry on 98 paraffin-embedded sections from 2005 to 2008. Moreover, RNA interference, CCK-8, colony formation, and flow-cytometry analyses were performed to investigate the role of Ring1 in the regulation of HCC cell proliferation.

We designed a study to examine factors associated with men's interest in genetic testing to identify prostate cancer susceptibility. Our sample consisted of 267 men present in waiting rooms of a urology clinic in an urban area. We examined whether the concept of ""monitoring"" could be used to predict the interest of men in a genetic test for prostate cancer susceptibility. Our results indicated that ""monitoring"" trait was positively associated with interest in genetic testing in these men, but principally for patients rather than nonpatients. Moreover we found that monitoring was associated with over estimation of risk in those men with prostate cancer. Other factors found to influence interest in genetic testing included recommendation by a doctor, family history of prostate cancer, and cost.

To date, the concrete pathogenic signaling pathways and core machineries involved in tumorigenesis and progression of PeCa remain to be elucidated. Several studies suggested miRNAs, which modulate gene expression at posttranscriptional level, were frequently mis-regulated and aberrantly expressed in human cancers. However, the miRNA profile in human PeCa has not been reported before. In this present study, the miRNA profile was obtained from 10 fresh penile cancerous tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues via next-generation sequencing. As a result, a total of 751 and 806 annotated miRNAs were identified in normal and cancerous penile tissues, respectively. Among which, 56 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels between paired tissues were identified. Subsequently, several annotated miRNAs were selected randomly and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the previous publications regarding to the altered miRNAs expression in various cancers and especially genitourinary (prostate, bladder, kidney, testis) cancers, the most majority of deregulated miRNAs showed the similar expression pattern in penile cancer. Moreover, the bioinformatics analyses suggested that the putative target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs between cancerous and matched normal penile tissues were tightly associated with cell junction, proliferation, growth as well as genomic instability and so on, by modulating Wnt, MAPK, p53, PI3K-Akt, Notch and TGF-β signaling pathways, which were all well-established to participate in cancer initiation and progression. Our work presents a global view of the differentially expressed miRNAs and potentially regulatory networks of their target genes for clarifying the pathogenic transformation of normal penis to PeCa, which research resource also provides new insights into future investigations aimed to explore the in-depth mechanisms of miRNAs and other small RNAs including piRNAs in penile carcinogenesis regulation and effective target-specific theragnosis.""","""['Li Zhang', 'Pengfei Wei', 'Xudong Shen', 'Yuanwei Zhang', 'Bo Xu', 'Jun Zhou', 'Song Fan', 'Zongyao Hao', 'Haoqiang Shi', 'Xiansheng Zhang', 'Rui Kong', 'Lingfan Xu', 'Jingjing Gao', 'Duohong Zou', 'Chaozhao Liang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[]"""

Experimental design:   To study the synergistic effect of both agents on human cancer xenografts, athymic nude (Nu/Nu) mice were used and treated with various combination regimes intraperitoneally. Serum levels of tumour markers for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were assessed using sandwich ELISA. IHC and Western blotting were also conducted on in vivo tumour biopsies to investigate the involvement of NF-κB regulated genes and inflammatory biomarkers. Quantification and correlation between drug efficacies and AFP-receptors were done using IF-IC and Pearson's correlation analysis.  Results:   Mice exposed to combined treatments displayed higher reductions in tumour volume compared to stand alone agents, consistent with in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Milder signs of systemic toxicity, such as loss in body weight and inflammation of vital organs were also demonstrated compared to stand alone treatments. Tumour marker levels were consistent within all rhAFP/ACA treatment groups where levels of CEA and PSA were initially elevated upon commencement of treatment, and consecutively reduced corresponding to a decrease in tumour bulk volume. Both IHC and Western blotting results indicated that the combined action of rhAFP/ACA was not only able to down-regulate NF-κB activation, but also reduce the expression of NF-κB regulated genes and inflammatory biomarkers. The efficacy of rhAFP/ACA complex was also found to be weakly negatively correlated to the level of surface AFP-receptors between tumour types.  Conclusions:   This drug complex formulation shows great therapeutic potential against AFP-receptor positive tumours, and serves as a basis to overcome insoluble and non-specific anti-neoplastic molecules.""","""['Norhafiza M Arshad', 'Lionel L A In', 'Tchen Lin Soh', 'Mohamad Nurul Azmi', 'Halijah Ibrahim', 'Khalijah Awang', 'Elena Dudich', 'Eduard Tatulov', 'Noor Hasima Nagoor']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""[]"""

Imaging findings were compared to standarised 20-core transperineal saturation biopsy. The prostate was divided into 16 standart sectors(10 posterior and 6 anterior).  Results:   Overall, prostate cancer was detected in 16 patients(94%) on DW-MRI alone and in all 17 patients (100%) on T2W-MRI alone, and on combined imaging. On T2W-MRI165 sectors out of 272 were suspicious for PCa and 124 (75%)were cancer positive. On DW-MRI 126 sectors out of 272 were suspicious for PCa and 118 (95%) were cancer positive. On the combined imaging approach 134 sectors out of 272 were suspicious for PCa and 126 (94%) were cancer positive. This resulted in diagnostic accuracies per sector of 76% for T2WMRI, 86% for DW-MRI and 89% for combined imaging. Multifocal PCa was confirmed both on MR imaging and by biopsy in 8 of the 17 men (47%) Extra capsular extension(ECE) or seminal vesicles invasion (SVI) was highly suspected in 8 (47%) respectively 7 (41%) of the 17 patients. 6 patients(35%) presented both ECE and SVI. MRI findings were taken into account for treatment planning and none of these patients underwent radical prostatectomy and instead was treated with palliative cryotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.  Conclusions:   Endorectal MRI is highly accurate in PCa detection in the high-risk group and seems to have an important role in local staging and treatment planning for Romanian population.""","""['A Lebovici', 'S A Sfrangeu', 'C Caraiani', 'C Lucan', 'M Suciu', 'F Elec', 'Gh Iacob', 'M Buruian;-']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chirurgia (Bucur)""","""[]"""

In addition, the RSK-EphA2 signalling pathway controls cell migration and invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells.

In this study, we used prostate tissues from Chinese cases to validate six of these markers (CAV1, COL4A2, HSPB1, ITGB3, MAP1A and MCAM). In validation by real-time PCR, four genes (COL4A2, HSPB1, ITGB3, and MAP1A) demonstrated significantly lower expression in tumor-adjacent stroma compared to normal stroma (p value ≤ 0.05). Next, we tested whether these expression differences could be extended to the protein level. In IHC assays, all six selected proteins showed lower expression in tumor-adjacent stroma compared to the normal stroma, of which COL4A2, HSPB1 and ITGB3 showed significant differences (p value ≤ 0.05).

Moreover, FGF9/TRAMP bigenic mice (F9TRAMP) grew advanced PCa earlier and had higher frequencies of metastasis than TRAMP littermates. We observed tumor microenvironmental changes including hypercellularity and hyperproliferation in the stromal compartment of F9TG and F9TRAMP mice. Expression of TGFβ1, a key signaling molecule overexpressed in reactive stroma, was increased in F9TG and F9TRAMP prostates. Both in vivo and in vitro data indicated that FGF9 promoted TGFβ1 expression via increasing cJun-mediated signaling. Moreover, in silico analyses showed that the expression level of FGF9 was positively associated with expression of TGFβ1 and its downstream signaling molecules in human prostate cancers.

Analysis of the β-PDGFR ligands in PCa revealed association between PDGF-D expression and Gleason score as well as tumor stage. During the course of studying the functional consequences of PDGF ligand-specific β-PDGFR signaling in PCa, we discovered a novel function of PDGF-D for activation/shedding of the serine protease matriptase leading to cell invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis. The present study showed that PDGF-D, not PDGF-B, induces extracellular acidification, which correlates with increased matriptase activation. A cDNA microarray analysis revealed that PDGF-D/β-PDGFR signaling upregulates expression of the acidosis regulator carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a classic target of the transcriptional factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Cellular fractionation displayed a strong HIF-1α nuclear localization in PDGF-D-expressing cells. Treatment of vector control or PDGF-B-expressing cells with the HIF-1α activator CoCl2 led to increased CAIX expression accompanied by extracellular acidosis and matriptase activation. Furthermore, the analysis of the CAFTD cell lines, variants of the BPH-1 transformation model, showed that increased PDGF-D expression is associated with enhanced HIF-1α activity, CAIX induction, cellular acidosis, and matriptase shedding. Importantly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CAIX expression effectively reversed extracellular acidosis and matriptase activation in PDGF-D-transfected BPH-1 cells and in CAFTD variants that express endogenous PDGF-D at a high level. Taken together, these novel findings reveal a new paradigm in matriptase activation involving PDGF-D-specific signal transduction leading to extracellular acidosis.""","""['Abdo J Najy', 'Gregory Dyson', 'Bhanu P Jena', 'Chen-Yong Lin', 'Hyeong-Reh C Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Cell Physiol""","""['A novel signaling axis of matriptase/PDGF-D/ß-PDGFR in human prostate cancer.', 'Differential tumorigenic potential and matriptase activation between PDGF B versus PDGF D in prostate cancer.', 'A novel function for platelet-derived growth factor D: induction of osteoclastic differentiation for intraosseous tumor growth.', 'Transcriptional control of the tumor- and hypoxia-marker carbonic anhydrase 9: A one transcription factor (HIF-1) show?', 'PDGF-C and PDGF-D signaling in vascular diseases and animal models.', 'Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases as Modulators in Adipose Tissue Phenotype and Function.', 'Targeting Breast Cancer Stem Cells.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'The production of recombinant platelet-derived growth factor D using the second generation modified vaccinia Ankara viral system.', 'Regulation of Tumor Metabolism and Extracellular Acidosis by the TIMP-10-CD63 Axis in Breast Carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   A retrospective, nonrandomized analysis was performed on 5044 prostate cancer (PCa) patients with median age 70 years, who received RT-with or without ADT-between November 1992 and May 2007.

Univariate association between predictor variables and BCR was assessed by the log-rank test, and three linked nomograms were created for multivariate prognosis of BCR-free survival. Each nomogram corresponds to a category of the Gleason score-either 6,7, or 8-10-and all of them were created from a single proportional hazards regression model stratified also by months of ADT (0, 1-6, 7-12, 13-24, 25-36, 36-60).

Nontoxic tea polyphenols are potent antioxidants, and they also modulate several signalling pathways and inhibit proteins such as MMP-9 or protein plasminogen activator system, making them very attractive potential therapeutics. One criticism of the prophylactic or therapeutic use of green or black tea polyphenols was presumably the poor bioavailability of these chemicals when ingested. However, studies have shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin (TF) can be detected in the small and large intestine, liver, and prostate of experimental animals after consumption of tea extracts. In particular, a study was carried out on 20 men scheduled for prostatectomy, who were assigned to consume teas for five days before surgery. Tea polyphenols were detected in the prostate. This fact contradicts the common misconception of poor bioavailability of TF and EGCG and makes feasible the application of green or black tea polyphenols as prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Theaflavins and catechins seem to act on cancer cells largely through different pathways, so utilisation of both could offer synergistic anticancer effects, but so far no work has been done on the cumulative effects of EGCG and TF on prostate cancer. Therefore, in this study we have investigated if EGCG in combination with TF can reduce the rate of prostate cancer growth, and we have observed greater cell death compared to application of either TF or EGCG alone.""","""['Andrew J Kobalka', 'Rick W Keck', 'Jerzy Jankun']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cent Eur J Immunol""","""['Tea polyphenols and theaflavins are present in prostate tissue of humans and mice after green and black tea consumption.', 'Inhibition of activator protein 1 activity and cell growth by purified green tea and black tea polyphenols in H-ras-transformed cells: structure-activity relationship and mechanisms involved.', ""Suppression of extracellular signals and cell proliferation by the black tea polyphenol, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate."", 'Tea Polyphenols in Promotion of Human Health.', 'Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as adjuvant in cancer therapy.', 'A comprehensive review of nano-delivery system for tea polyphenols: Construction, applications, and challenges.', 'Anti-Cancer Properties of Theaflavins.', 'Can components of the plasminogen activation system predict the outcome of kidney transplants?', 'Can EGCG Alleviate Symptoms of Down Syndrome by Altering Proteolytic Activity?', 'Formulation and characterization of EGCG for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.']"""

In addition to inducing AhR degradation, TCDD has been reported to induce degradation of hormone receptors. The studies reported here, evaluate the effect of TCDD exposure on androgen receptor (AR) expression and activity in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 prostate cancer cells. Our results show that TCDD exposure does not induce AhR or AR degradation in C4-2 cells. However, both AhR and AR are degraded in LNCaP cells following TCDD exposure.

Patients and methods:   In the study, 805 men underwent 3 tesla mpMRI without endorectal coil before MRI/transrectal ultrasonography-fusion guided prostate biopsy. MRIs were analyzed using the prostate imaging reporting and data system. The cohort was classified into risk groups according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria. Of 132 men who subsequently underwent RP, pathologic stage and SM status at RP were used as reference. Retrospectively, we investigated a European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) score for ECE and SV-infiltration. Statistical analyses included regression analyses, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and Youden Index to assess an ESUR-score cutoff.  Results:   Area under the curve in ROC curve analyses was 0.82 for ESUR-ECE score to detect pT(3a)-disease and 0.77 for ESUR-SV score for pT(3b). Using a cutoff of 4 for ECE and of 2 for SV, the positive predictive value of the ECE-score for harboring pT(3) was 50.0%, 90.0%, and 88.8% for the low-, intermediate- and high-risk cohort. Retrospectively, the use of the ESUR-ECE score preoperatively would have changed the initial surgical plan, according to NCCN criteria, in 31.1% of patients. In the high-risk subgroup, 9/35 (25.7%) patients were correctly assessed as not harboring pT(3) by imaging (ECE score <4), and would have allowed secure robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and nerve-sparing surgery (NSS). When T3 suspicion on preoperative MRI would be taken into account, intraoperative frozen-sections (IFS) might avoid positive SM in 12/18 high-risk patients and an oncologic secure NSS in 8/20 intermediate-risk patients.  Conclusion:   Prediction of pT(3) disease is crucial to plan NSS and to achieve negative SM in RP. Standardized ECE scoring on mpMRI is an independent predictor of pT(3) and may help to plan RP with oncologic security, even in high-risk patients.

Progesterone inhibited oestrogen-mediated growth of ERα(+) cell line xenografts and primary ERα(+) breast tumour explants, and had increased anti-proliferative effects when coupled with an ERα antagonist. Copy number loss of PGR, the gene coding for PR, is a common feature in ERα(+) breast cancers, explaining lower PR levels in a subset of cases.

Methods:   For heterogeneity analysis, a prostate cancer heterogeneity TMA containing samples from 10 different tumor blocks of 189 consecutive prostate cancers was used. PSMA expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   PSMA expression was found in 97.6% of 1171 interpretable tissue spots including 260 (22.2%) with weak, 345 (29.5%) with moderate, and 538 (45.9%) with strong positivity.

Inherited deficiency in factor XI or XII or high-molecular-weight kininogen, but not plasma kallikrein, protected mice from prostasome-induced lethal pulmonary embolism. Targeting polyphosphate or factor XII conferred resistance to prostate cancer-driven thrombosis in mice, without increasing bleeding. Inhibition of factor XII with recombinant 3F7 antibody reduced the increased prostasome-mediated procoagulant activity in patient plasma.

We compared all-cause mortality between foreign-born and Sweden-born residents of Sweden who were diagnosed with cancer of the colon, lung, stomach, prostate, breast, cervix, and all site.  Methods:   We used Swedish national vital status and health registers to follow a cohort of 1,556,108 patients 45 years of age and older diagnosed with cancer between 1961 and 2009 in Sweden. Among them, 109,915 were born abroad. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   We identified 604,035 and 540,138 deaths among men and women, respectively. Among them 33,595 men and 34,174 women were born abroad. At the time of diagnosis, patients born abroad were on average 4 years younger than patients born in Sweden. All-cause mortality was generally lower in the former than in the latter group of patients before 1990 but higher after 2000. The mortality trend was similar for prostate and breast cancer.  Conclusions:   Whilst national policy in Sweden aims at achieving equal access to health care, the mortality trend observed among cancer patients born in Sweden was different from that observed among patients born elsewhere. Mortality after diagnosis of major types of cancer has worsened among foreign-born after the year 2000.

Dosimetric measurements were taken in Philips SL25/75, Elekta Synergy Platform (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden), Varian Clinac DHX High Performance systems (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), and Cyberknife Robotic Radiosurgery Unit (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) using bubble detector for neutron dosimetry. The measurement data were used to determine in-field and out-of-field neutron equivalent dose in 6-MV 3D conformal radiotherapy, sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy and to calculate the effective dose in 18-MV 3D conformal radiotherapy and sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques for patients with prostate cancer undergoing a standard treatment. For the 18-MV treatment techniques, the secondary malignancy risk due to the neutron contamination was estimated using the risk factors published by The International Commission on Radiological Protection. The neutron contamination-based secondary malignancy risk for the 18-MV 3D conformal radiotherapy and sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy modalities was found to be 0.44% and 1.45% for Elekta Synergy Platform and 0.92% and 3.0% for the Varian Clinac DHX High Performance, respectively. For 6-MV 3D conformal radiotherapy, sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment techniques, neutron equivalent doses inside the treatment field were found to be lower than 40 mSv. Our measurements reveal that equivalent dose and effective dose due to the neutron contamination are at a considerable level for 18-MV sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatments, while 6-MV photon beams used in different modalities still induce only negligible photoneutrons. The secondary malignancy risk based on photoneutron should be therefore taken into consideration in case of selecting 18-MV photons in a sliding window-intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment instead of 6 MV.""","""['Fatih Biltekin', 'Mete Yeginer', 'Gokhan Ozyigit']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['SU-E-T-208: The Secondary Malignancy Risk Estimation Due to the Neutron Contamination in 3D-CRT and IMRT Treatment Techniques by Using Bubble Detectors.', 'Whole-body dose equivalent including neutrons is similar for 6 MV and 15 MV IMRT, VMAT, and 3D conformal radiotherapy.', 'In vivo and phantom measurements of the secondary photon and neutron doses for prostate patients undergoing 18 MV IMRT.', 'Different Methods of Measuring Neutron Dose/Fluence Generated During Radiation Therapy with Megavoltage Beams.', 'Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy: Which machine for which therapeutic indication?

Patients in cohort 1 (n = 33) and cohort 2 (n = 34) received 76 Gy in 34 fractions (2.25 Gy/F) and 71.6 Gy in 28 fractions (2.65 Gy/F), respectively, to the prostate and seminal vesicles, while 25 patients in cohort 2 also received integrated elective lymph node irradiation (50.4 Gy). All patients were treated with helical tomotherapy, and daily image guidance was performed before each treatment. Acute toxicities were assessed with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. No significant difference was detected between the 2 cohorts in the incidence of acute toxicities. In cohort 1, the incidences of grade 1 and 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 45.5% and 45.4%, respectively, and without grade 3 and 4 toxicities. In cohort 2, the incidences of acute grade 1 and 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 47.1% and 55.9%, respectively, and grade 3 genitourinary toxicity (hematuria) was noted only in 1 patient. No significant difference was detected in the incidence of acute toxicities between the patients receiving integrated elective lymph node irradiation and those receiving irradiation to prostate and seminal vesicle in cohort 2.

For instance, in high-throughput cancer treatment screening experiments, it is meaningful to test whether any new treatment effects are seen compared with existing compounds. Here, we present hypothesis tests for such global level novelty. The problem is approached through a set of very general assumptions, making it innovative in relation to the current literature. We introduce test statistics capable of detecting novelty. They operate on local neighborhoods and their null distribution is obtained by the permutation principle.

In this study, we sought to investigate potential mechanisms that govern WWP1/Tiul1 (WWP1) ubiquitin ligase activity, focusing on its ability to trigger degradation of TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) in conjunction with Smad7. Our data reveal that the WWP1 protein is very stable at steady states because its autopolyubiquitination activity is silenced due to an intra-interaction between the C2 and/or WW and Hect domains that favors WWP1 monoubiquitination at the expense of its polyubiquitination or polyubiquitination of TβRI. Upon binding of WWP1 to Smad7, this functional interplay is disabled, switching its monoubiquitination activity toward a polyubiquitination activity, thereby driving its own degradation and that of TβRI as well. Intriguingly, a WWP1 point mutation found in human prostate cancer disrupts this regulatory mechanism by relieving the inhibitory effects of C2 and WW on Hect and thereby causing WWP1 hyperactivation. That cancer-driven alteration of WWP1 culminates in excessive TβRI degradation and attenuated TGFβ cytostatic signaling, a consequence that could conceivably confer tumorigenic properties to WWP1.""","""['Thomas Courivaud', 'Nathalie Ferrand', 'Abdelouahid Elkhattouti', 'Santosh Kumar', 'Laurence Levy', 'Olivier Ferrigno', 'Azeddine Atfi', 'Céline Prunier']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['WW Domain-Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1: A Self-Disciplined Oncoprotein.', 'Negative regulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling by WW domain-containing protein 1 (WWP1).', 'Tollip, an intracellular trafficking protein, is a novel modulator of the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway.', 'The novel E3 ubiquitin ligase Tiul1 associates with TGIF to target Smad2 for degradation.', 'WWP1: a versatile ubiquitin E3 ligase in signaling and diseases.', ""Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes in Huntington's disease."", 'WW Domain-Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1: A Self-Disciplined Oncoprotein.', 'The emerging role of WWP1 in cancer development and progression.', 'E3 Ubiquitin Ligases: Key Regulators of TGFβ Signaling in Cancer Progression.', 'Structural insights into a HECT-type E3 ligase AREL1 and its ubiquitination activities in vitro.']"""

A phase II protocol was developed to investigate the benefit and tolerability of regional hyperthermia with moderately dose-escalated radiotherapy.  Methods:   The study hypothesis is that radio-thermotherapy is a safe and feasible salvage treatment modality. The primary endpoint is safety measured by frequency of grade 3+ genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4. Feasibility is defined by number of hyperthermia treatments (n ≥ 7) and feasibility of radiotherapy according to protocol. Target volume delineation is performed according to the EORTC guidelines. Radiation treatment is administered with single doses of 2 Gy 5×/week to a total dose of 70 Gy. Regional hyperthermia is given 2×/week to a total of 10 treatments.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer eventually fails with relapse occurring in the form of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC tumors typically overexpress androgen receptor (AR), demonstrating continued dependence upon AR signaling. Platelets have been previously demonstrated to contain androgens, and we sought to explore the contribution of platelet-derived androgens in CRPC. In this study, we examined the role of platelet-derived androgens in vitro using platelets from men with CRPC, men with high-risk prostate cancer, and healthy male donors. A series of in vitro assays was performed to elucidate the impact of platelet-derived androgens on androgen-sensitive prostate tumor cells. By examining platelet-derived androgen effects on AR signaling in prostate tumor cells, we found that platelets, from men with CRPC and on ADT, strongly induce AR target genes and tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, we show a fully intact testosterone (T) biosynthetic pathway within platelets from its precursor cholesterol and demonstrate that platelets of CRPC patients with ADT resistance are able to generate T. Overall, our findings reveal an unknown capacity of platelets to synthesize T at functionally relevant levels in patients with lethal prostate cancer.

In this post hoc analysis we investigated the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in elderly (age 75 years or greater) and younger (less than 75 years) patient subgroups at the prespecified interim analysis (55% of total overall survival events) for the COU-AA-302 (Abiraterone Acetate in Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer) trial.  Materials and methods:   Patients were stratified and randomized 1:1 to abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg plus prednisone/prednisolone 5 mg twice daily (abiraterone-prednisone) vs placebo plus prednisone/prednisolone 5 mg twice daily (prednisone alone). Co-primary end points were radiographic progression-free and overall survival. Median time to event and HR were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox model, respectively.  Results:   A total of 350 elderly patients treated with abiraterone-prednisone had significant improvements in overall and radiographic progression-free survival vs those with prednisone alone (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.96 vs HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.83), similar to 738 younger patients (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63-1.03 vs HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40-0.59). All secondary end points favored the abiraterone-prednisone arm for both age subgroups. Specific adverse events with abiraterone-prednisone were similar between the age subgroups. Elderly patients in both treatment arms had higher rates of fluid retention and cardiac disorders than younger patients, although rates of dose reduction or treatment interruptions due to adverse events were low in both age subgroups.  Conclusions:   Abiraterone acetate demonstrated clinical benefit and was well tolerated in elderly and younger men with chemotherapy naïve, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Thus, findings support it as a treatment option for elderly patients who may not tolerate other therapies with greater toxicity.""","""['Matthew R Smith', 'Dana E Rathkopf', 'Peter F A Mulders', 'Joan Carles', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Jinhui Li', 'Thian Kheoh', 'Thomas W Griffin', 'Arturo Molina', 'Charles J Ryan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in an elderly patient subgroup (aged 75 and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone in the treatment of prostate cancer: safety and efficacy.', 'Feasibility of cabazitaxel in octogenarian prostate cancer patients.', 'Association between age and efficacy of combination systemic therapies in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Real-world outcomes and risk stratification in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer treated with upfront abiraterone acetate and docetaxel.', 'Apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus placebo plus abiraterone and prednisone in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (ACIS): a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 study.', 'Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Signaling Inhibitors for Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Older Patients.']"""

It is a common practice to start an average 7-day pretreatment regimen with an antiandrogen agent before initiating GnRH agonist therapy, to circumvent disease flare from testosterone surge. However, this might not be the best strategy and can be harmful, especially in patients at high risk of imminent organ damage from minimal testosterone surge. Surgical castration is a simple and cost-effective method that should be considered in these scenarios. But most patients refuse this procedure because of the permanent and psychologic impact of surgery. Novel GnRH antagonists, such as degarelix, and cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17) enzyme inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, achieve castrate-equivalent serum testosterone levels much faster than traditional GnRH agonists without the need for coadministration of antiandrogens. This article reports on 3 cases of impending oncologic emergencies in advanced prostate adenocarcinoma treated promptly with degarelix and ketoconazole without any disease flare related to testosterone surge. In the setting of symptomatic hormone-naïve metastatic prostate cancer, the authors suggest clinical trials using abiraterone, orteronel, and other newer agents that target the CYP17 axis (eg, ketoconazole) for fine-tuning the emergent medical castration methods and avoiding the dangers from the flare phenomenon.""","""['Venkata K Pokuri', 'Houman Nourkeyhani', 'Bodie Betsy', 'Laurie Herbst', 'Marcus Sikorski', 'Edward Spangenthal', 'Andrew Fabiano', 'Saby George']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['The efficacy and safety of degarelix: a 12-month, comparative, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III study in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Abarelix and other gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: an update review of the antagonists versus agonists.', 'The effect of baseline testosterone on the efficacy of degarelix and leuprolide: further insights from a 12-month, comparative, phase III study in prostate cancer patients.', 'Degarelix 240/80 mg: a new treatment option for patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Small-molecule inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and more: FDA-approved novel therapeutic drugs for solid tumors from 1991 to 2021.', 'Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways.']"""

Histopathological findings were compatible with benign etiology in 36 (61%) patients and malign etiology in 23 (39%) patients. Additionally, comparisons were made to evaluate the relationships between uptake patterns,total PSA values and Gleason scores.  Results:   A statistically significant difference was found between the benign and malignant groups in terms of uptake in planar and SPECT images and T/Bg ratios and PSA values. No statistically significant difference was found between uptake patterns of planar and SPECT images and Gleason scores in the malignant group.

We investigate the influence of the antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs (AP/AC drugs) on the transfusion requirement after vesical transurethral resection (VTUR). We also describe the epidemiology of the blood components transfusion in our department.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective observational study of a series of patients needing blood transfusion at the Urology Department between June 2010 and June 2013. Selection of 100 consecutive patients who were transfused after VTUR due to bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC) (group A = GA).  Control group:   100 consecutive patients who underwent VTUR due to BTCC and were not transfused (group B = GB). Transfusion criteria: Haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl + anaemia symptoms. Age, gender, associated AP/AC treatment, secondary diagnoses, toxics, tumour stage and grade were analysed.  Results:   212 patients required transfusion of a blood component. 169 were men (79%) and 43 women (21%). Median age 77.59 years (SD 9.42, range 50-92). Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus 64%, high blood pressure 77%, dyslipidemia 52%. 60% of patients were previously treated with AP/AC drugs. Average Haemoglobin pre-transfusion values: 7.4 g/dl (DE ± 0.7). Average Haemoglobin post-transfusion values: 8.9 g/Dl (DE ± 0.72). Most frequent transfusion indications were bladder cancer (37%), kidney cancer (11%), prostate cancer (8%), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) (8%), other urological diagnoses (36%). Intraoperative transfusions indicated by the anaesthesiologist: kidney cancer (33%), BPH (28%). Patients who underwent VTUR due to BTCC were older in GA (77.59 years SD 9.42) than in GB (68.98 years SD 11.78) (p = 0.0001). Similar gender distribution (15 women in GA and 24 in GB). Less patients were asked to keep their treatment with ASA 100mg (AcetylSalicylicAcid) in GA (25.64%) than in GB (50%) (p = 0.0330). More aggressive tumour grade in GA (p = 0.0003) and higher stage in GA (p = 0.0018) regardless of concomitant treatment with AP/AC drugs.  Conclusions:   The pathologies which most needed blood components' transfusions in the Urology Department were (in order of frequency): bladder cancer, kidney cancer, prostate cancer, prostate adenoma. ASA100mg did not influence the transfusion's requirements in VTUR due to BTCC. Tumour stage and higher grade have a greater influence in transfusion's requirements than concomitant AP/AC treatment. The heterogeneity of AP/AC protocols does not allow to establish the benefit of stopping those drugs before surgery in terms of avoiding blood transfusions when performing a VTUR.""","""['Alvaro Julio Virseda-Rodríguez', 'Barbara Padilla-Fernández', 'Mirian López-Parra', 'Maria Tatiana Santos-Antunes', 'Lauro Sebastian Valverde-Martínez', 'Maria Jesus Nieto-González', 'Jesus Fernando San Miguel-Izquierdo', 'Anabel Lorenzo-Gómez', 'Maria Begoña García-Cenador', 'Patricia Antúnez-Plaza', 'Maria Fernanda Lorenzo-Gómez']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Towards bloodless cystectomy: a 10-year experience of intra-operative cell salvage during radical cystectomy.', 'Role of immediate radical cystectomy in the treatment of patients with residual T1 bladder cancer on restaging transurethral resection.', 'Results of radical cystectomy for management of invasive bladder cancer with special reference to prognostic factors and quality of life depending on the type of urinary diversion.', 'Clinical outcome in patients with locally advanced bladder carcinoma treated with conservative multimodality therapy.', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Perioperative Safety of Bladder Hydrodistention in Patients on Antithrombotic Therapy.']"""

Therefore patients' quality of life is disrupted and duration of hospitalization is prolonged. Relevant literature about accurate staging and treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer with bladder invasion was investigated. Locally advanced prostate cancer can present as a large-volume aggressive tumor extending beyond boundaries of prostate gland, and involving neighboring structures which can be involved as recurrence(s) following initial local therapy. Survival times of these patients can range between 5 and 8 years. Their common characteristics are adverse and severe local symptoms unfavorably affecting quality of life Control of local symptoms and their effective palliation are independent clinical targets influencing survival outcomes of these patients. The treatment outcomes of locally advanced prostate cancer into the bladder are currently debatable. Although in the current TNM classification, it is defined in T4a, we think that this may be categorized as a subgroup of T3 and thus encourage surgeons for the indication of radical surgeries (radical prostatectomy, radical cystoprostatectomy) in selected patient populations after discussing issues concerning consequences of the treatment alternatives, and expectations with the patients. Cystoprostatectomy followed by immediate androgen deprivation therapy may be a feasible option for selected patients with previously untreated prostate cancer involving the bladder neck because of excellent local control and long term survival.""","""['Özgür Haki Yüksel', 'Ayhan Verit', 'Ahmet Ürkmez']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Cystoprostatectomy for effective palliation of symptomatic bladder invasion by prostate cancer.', 'Value of cystoprostatectomy in locally advanced prostate carcinoma.', 'Cystoprostatectomy as a treatment of prostate cancer involving the bladder neck.', 'Prognostic influence of prostate gland invasion by bladder tumour and/or prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomy specimen: a review.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'The role of cystoprostatectomy in management of locally advanced prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

It is unknown whether comorbidity interacts clinically with prostate cancer (PC) to increase the VTE rate beyond that explained by PC and comorbidity alone, for example, by delaying diagnosis or precluding treatment.  Methods:   A nationwide, registry-based cohort study of all 44,035 Danish patients diagnosed with PC from 1995 to 2011 and 213,810 men from the general population matched 5:1 on age, calendar time, and comorbidities. The authors calculated VTE rate ratios and the interaction contrast as a measure on the additive scale of the excess VTE rate explained by synergy between PC and comorbidity.  Results:   In total, 849 patients in the PC cohort and 2360 men from the general population had VTE during 5 years of follow-up, and their risk of VTE was 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. The 1-year VTE standardized rate among PC patients who had high comorbidity levels was 15 per 1000 person-years (PYs) (95% confidence interval, 6.8-24 per 1000 PYs), and 29% of that rate was explained by an interaction between PC and comorbidity. The VTE risk was increased among older patients, those with metastases, those with high Gleason scores, those in the D'Amico high-risk group, and those who underwent surgery.  Conclusions:   PC interacted clinically with high comorbidity levels and increased the VTE rate. Because of the large PC burden, reducing VTEs associated with comorbidities may have an impact on VTE risk and the potential to improve prognosis. Clinical interactions between high levels of comorbidity and PC on the risk of VTE were observed. Almost 30% of all episodes of VTE occurred among patients who had high levels of comorbidity.""","""['Anne G Ording', 'Erzsébet Horváth-Puhó', 'Timothy L Lash', 'Vera Ehrenstein', 'Michael Borre', 'Mogens Vyberg', 'Henrik T Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Comorbidity and the risk of venous thromboembolism in prostate cancer.', 'Colorectal cancer, comorbidity, and risk of venous thromboembolism: assessment of biological interactions in a Danish nationwide cohort.', 'Cancer, other comorbidity, and risk of venous thromboembolism after stroke: a population-based cohort study.', 'Venous thromboembolism and effect of comorbidity in bladder cancer: A danish nationwide cohort study of 13,809 patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2011.', 'Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer: epidemiology and risk factors.', 'Venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.', 'Construction and Verification of Risk Predicting Models to Evaluate the Possibility of Venous Thromboembolism After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'MALAT1 Fusions and Basal Cells Contribute to Primary Resistance against Androgen Receptor Inhibition in TRAMP Mice.', 'Regulated Cell Death in Urinary Malignancies.', 'Association of smoking and cancer with the risk of venous thromboembolism: the Scandinavian Thrombosis and Cancer cohort.', 'The Risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Treated with 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors (5ARIs).']"""

Methods:   From January 2003 to March 2014, 1832 patients with prostate cancer were treated, among which 9 patients (represented 0.49%) were identified as Gleason score 10 disease on prostate core biopsy without distant metastases when first diagnosed. All 9 patients were treated by whole pelvic external radiotherapy (The whole pelvic dose was 50.0 Gy and the boost dose ranged from 76.2 to 78.0 Gy) and long-term hormone therapy. We assessed the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes and treatment toxicities. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The median follow-up was 4.8 years. Six patients' pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were lower than 20.0 μg/L and three patients' pre-treatment PSA levels were higher than 70.0 μg/L. The median percentage of positive biopsy cores was 91%. Three, four and two cases were classified as T2c, T3a and T3b stage, respectively. Three cases were assessed as N1 stage. The 5-year biochemical failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, cancer specific survival and overall survival rates were 28.6%, 57.1%, 66.7% and 57.1%, respectively. Five patients experienced grade 1-2 acute gastrointestinal toxicities and six patients complained of grade 1-2 acute genitourinary toxicities. No bone fracture or cardiovascular disease was detected.  Conclusions:   Gleason score 10 prostate cancer on core biopsy is usually combined with other high risk factors. The pre-treatment PSA levels lie in two extremes.

The combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) resembles glycosaminoglycan (GAG) replenishment therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of HA and CS on nocturia, in men with nocturia after PCa radiotherapy.  Methods:   Twenty-three consecutive patients with symptomatic cystitis after external radiotherapy for PCa were enrolled. Patients underwent bladder instillation therapy with HA and CS weekly for the first month and, afterwards, on week 6, 8 and 12. Nocturnal voiding frequency was assessed by item 3 (Q3) of the Interstitial Cystitis Symptoms Index (ICSI) and item 2 (Q2) of the Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI). Data were analyzed with paired-samples T-test and adjusted for age.  Results:   Eighteen patients (78%) reported about nocturia. Pre- and post-treatment ICSI-Q3 was 2.13 ± 0.28 and 1.61 ± 0.21 (-24.4%, p = 0.001). With logistic regression analysis, both age and baseline ICSI-Q3 had a significant impact on nocturnal voiding frequency (r = 0.293, p = 0.011 and r = 0.970, p < 0.001). Pre- and post-treatment ICPI-Q2 was 1.87 ± 0.26 and 1.30 ± 0.25 (-30.5%, p = 0.016); logistic regression analysis was without significant findings.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying L-plastin transcription are unclear. We hypothesize that the occurrence of polymorphic genetic variations in the L-plastin promoter might affect an individual's susceptibility to prostate cancer. In this study, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -1,687 in the L-plastin promoter by genotype sequencing. The SNP -1,687 showed different transcriptional activity in the luciferase assay in vitro. The TRANSFAC software was applied to predict the multiple cis-elements, and luciferase assay was used to further identify the L-plastin regulatory region. We performed EMSAs, supershift assays and ChIP-qPCR demonstrated that the transcriptional suppressor NKX3.1 binds to the SNP site of the L-plastin promoter. SNP -1,687 (T/T) led to an increase in the affinity of NKX3.1 for L-plastin promoter, resulted in lower levels of L-plastin RNA and protein expression. Furthermore, we collected and sequenced samples from 640 individuals (372 prostate cancer patients and 268 healthy controls) from 2000 to 2013. The results showed that SNP -1,687 (T/T) occurred more frequently in the healthy individuals than that in the prostate cancer patients compared to SNP -1,687 (C/C). Similarly, SNP -1,687 (T/T) genotype occurred more frequently compared to SNP -1,687 (C/C) genotype in the patients with low and moderately differentiated tumors. In conclusion, SNP -1,687, located in the NKX3.1 binding site within the L-plastin promoter, might reduce the expression of L-plastin and potentially decrease the tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer.

The absence of electron beams and the inability to seamlessly deliver inverse planned intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) segments, mean that some out-of-the-box thinking is mandatory for the full range of required treatments in different clinical settings, but is ultimately very rewarding. Our department started off in July 2011, with the Elekta Compact, equipped with MLCi2 and a camera-based electron portal imaging device. For head-neck cancers, we have successfully utilized a 3D conformal class-solution of eight-to-nine oblique beams, with multiple segments, to deliver an adequate dose to the posterior neck, respecting spinal cord tolerance. Parotid gland sparing is possible in selected node-negative hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancers. For prostate cancers, we have developed a forward-planned IMRT protocol to routinely deliver 76-80 Gy to the prostate, with margins, while conforming to the same rectal dose-volume constraints as in inverse IMRT. Response and tolerance have been excellent so far. In head-neck cancers, the majority (71%) of patients was locally advanced; however, complete response was achieved in 75% of the cases. Grade 3 acute toxicities were seen in only 7% of the cases and compliance overall was excellent, with no patients requiring a gap in treatment. We achieved biochemical control in 100% of the prostate cancer patients; no patients had grade 3 acute toxicities, and with a median follow-up of 12 months, have yet to see any late rectal bleeding. Although engineered for simplicity and versatility, the Compact requires some innovative thinking by clinicians/physicists to optimize the full range of its possibilities. However, upgrades like inverse IMRT delivery, which are in the pipeline, are urgently needed for it to be viable, especially in a single-accelerator department.""","""['Jyotirup Goswami', 'Suman Mallik', 'Arnab Adhikary', 'Suresh Das', 'Bipasha Pal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['3D-conformal-intensity modulated radiotherapy with compensators for head and neck cancer: clinical results of normal tissue sparing.', 'Simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas: II--clinical results.', 'Preservation of oral health-related quality of life and salivary flow rates after inverse-planned intensity- modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head-and-neck cancer.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Clinical evaluation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancers.', 'High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: A Clinical Review.', 'A Survival Analysis of Hypopharyngeal Cancer Patients: A Hospital-Cancer registry Based Study.']"""

Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were transfected with miR-221/222 mimics or inhibitors. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. The expression levels of miR-221/222 were detected with quantitative real-time PCR. Apoptosis was induced with TNF-α/CHX treatment, and evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining, propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometric analysis, caspase-3 activity measurement, and Western blot analysis. Luciferase activity assay, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot were performed to evaluate the effects of miR-221/222 on caspase-10 expression.  Results:   Our results showed that miR-221/222 could promote the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, including LNCaP and PC3 cells. After transfection and apoptosis induction, Hoechst 33342 staining and PI flow cytometric assay showed that apoptosis was dramatically decreased in prostate cancer cells treated with miR-221/222 mimics. Moreover, caspase-3 activity was dramatically decreased, and the cleaved forms of caspase-3 were reduced, in the miR-221/222 mimic-treated group. On the contrary, miR-221/222 knockdown sensitized the prostate cancer cells to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between the expressions of miR-221/222 and caspase-10 in prostate cancer cells. miR-221/222 could repress the expression of caspase-10, which was confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay.

We investigated the effect of a smaller multileaf collimator (MLC) width on the onset of late rectal bleeding after high-dose prostate IMRT.  Materials and methods:   Two hundred and five prostate cancer patients were treated with a total dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions by use of a dynamic MLC technique; however, two different MLC were used: a 10-mm-wide device and a 5-mm-wide device. Gastrointestinal toxicity and several clinical factors were assessed.  Results:   The 5-year actuarial risk of grade 2 or higher rectal bleeding was 6.9 % for the 10-mm-wide group (n = 132) and 1.8 % for the 5-mm-wide group (n = 73) (p = 0.04). The median estimated rectal doses for the two groups were 55.1 and 50.6 Gy (p < 0.001), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that acute toxicity, rectal V30-60, median rectal dose, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and MLC type were significant predictive factors for late rectal toxicity. In multivariate analysis, acute toxicity and NTCP remained significant.

Design and methods:   Calgary Laboratory Services' Clinical Laboratory Information System was searched for prostate biopsies reported between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Total prostate-specific antigen tests were recorded for each patient from January 1, 2007 to the most recent test before their recorded prostate biopsy. The data set was divided into the following three groups for comparison; benign, all prostate cancer and Gleason 7-10. The Gleason grade 7-10 group was further divided into 4+3 and 3+4 Gleason 7 prostate cancers. Prostate-specific antigen velocity was calculated using four different methods found in the literature. Receiver operator curves were used to assess operational characteristics of the tests.  Results:   4622 men between the ages of 40-89 with a prostate biopsy were included for analysis. Combining prostate-specific antigen velocity with total prostate-specific antigen (AUC=0.570-0.712) resulted in small non-statistically significant changes to the area under the curve compared to the area under the curve of total prostate-specific antigen alone (AUC=0.572-0.699). There were marked increases in the area under curves when 3+4 and 4+3 Gleason 7 cancers were separated.

Objectives:   To assess the oncologic and functional outcomes of focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation in unilateral organ-confined PCa.  Design, setting and patients:   Single-center prospective evaluation of HIFU hemiablation for unilateral organ-confined PCa was performed from July 2009 through December 2013.  Intervention:   Cancer localization was done with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging followed by HIFU hemiablation.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   Oncologic outcomes were analyzed with control biopsies and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement. Functional outcomes were assessed with validated questionnaires for genitourinary symptoms.  Results and limitations:   Of 71 HIFU hemiablation patients, 67 completed the study protocol. The mean age was 70.2 yr (standard deviation: 6.8 yr), and median PSA was 6.1 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.6-15.5 ng/ml). Median maximum cancer-core length was 3 mm (IQR: 2-10 mm), and total cancer length was 6.5 mm (IQR: 2-24 mm). Gleason score was 6 (3+3) in 58 patients (86.6%) and 7 (3+4) in 9 patients (13.4%). Median follow-up was 12 mo (IQR: 6-50 mo), and at 12 mo, 56 of 67 patients had a negative control biopsy in the treated lobe. At 3 mo, all patients were continent, and potency was maintained in 11 of 21 preoperatively potent patients (confidence interval, 0.18-0.69). Complications included 8% Clavien-Dindo grade 2 and 2.8% grade 3 events.  Conclusions:   Focal HIFU hemiablation appears to achieve acceptable oncologic outcomes with low morbidity and minimal functional changes. Longer follow-up will establish future considerations.

Materials and methods:   The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried from 2005 to 2013 to identify patients undergoing cystectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and nephroureterectomy. Using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, 11 variables were matched to the database; 4 were also added because of their relevance in oncology patients. The incidence of mortality, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, and adverse events were assessed with patients grouped according to their modified frailty index score.  Results:   We identified 41,681 patients who were undergoing surgery for presumed urologic malignancy. Patients with a high frailty index score of >0.20 had a 3.70 odds of a Clavien-Dindo IV event (CI: 2.865-4.788, P<0.0005) and a 5.95 odds of 30-day mortality (CI: 3.72-9.51, P<0.0005) in comparison with nonfrail patients after adjusting for race, sex, age, smoking history, and procedure. Using C-statistics to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive ability of different models per risk stratification tool and the Akaike information criteria to assess for the fit of the models with the data, the modified frailty index was comparable or superior to the Charlson comorbidity index but inferior to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class in predicting 30-day mortality or Clavien-Dindo IV events. When the modified frailty index was augmented with the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class, the new index was superior in all aspects in comparison to other risk stratification tools.  Conclusion:   Existing risk stratification tools may be improved by incorporating variables in our 15-point modified frailty index as well as other factors such as walking speed, exhaustion, and sarcopenia to fully assess frailty. This is relevant in diseases such as kidney and prostate cancer, where surveillance and other nonsurgical interventions exist as alternatives to a potentially complicated surgery. In these scenarios, our modified frailty index augmented by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class may help inform which patients have increased surgical complications that may outweigh the benefit of surgery although this index needs prospective validation.""","""['Danny Lascano', 'Jamie S Pak', 'Max Kates', 'Julia B Finkelstein', 'Mark Silva', 'Elizabeth Hagen', 'Arindam RoyChoudhury', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'G Joel DeCastro', 'Mitchell C Benson', 'James M McKiernan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Re: Validation of a Frailty Index in Patients Undergoing Curative Surgery for Urologic Malignancy and Comparison with Other Risk Stratification Tools.', 'Frailty impact on postoperative complications and early mortality rates in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a systematic review.', 'Use of the modified frailty index to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality from spine surgery.', 'Modified frailty index associated with Clavien-Dindo IV complications in robot-assisted radical prostatectomies: A retrospective study.', 'Assessment of the Predictive Value of the Modified Frailty Index for Clavien-Dindo Grade IV Critical Care Complications in Major Head and Neck Cancer Operations.', 'Surgical Risk and Comorbidity in Older Urologic Patients.', 'Impact of Frailty Risk on Adverse Outcomes after Traumatic Brain Injury: A Historical Cohort Study.', 'Frailty is a predictor of moderate to severe pain after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: A case-control study (FRAP study).', 'Prognostic value of the veterans affairs frailty index in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Evaluation of comorbidity indices in determining the most suitable candidates for uro-oncological surgeries in elderly men.', 'Frailty impact on postoperative complications and early mortality rates in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a systematic review.']"""

Methods:   Between 2000 and 2013, 1864 men consented to participate in a prospective longitudinal outcomes study after RP for localized PCa by a single surgeon. Men lost to follow-up were queried to the National Death Index to acquire mortality data.  Results:   From our cohort of 1864 men (median age 59 years, median preoperative prostate-specific antigen 5.0, median follow-up 9.1 years), Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated 10-year all-cause mortality and PCSM of 4.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Ten-year PCSM for low, intermediate, and high D'Amico risk were 0.9%, 1.0%, and 7.4%, respectively (P <.001). For men with postoperative Gleason score 4-6, 7, and 8-10, 10-year PCSM was 0.8%, 1.0%, and 11.5%, respectively (P <.001).

Although several studies provide evidence of transcriptional control of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by various endogenous and exogenous compounds, potential post-transcriptional regulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by microRNAs (miRs) in prostate cancer cells has not been examined. The present study identified a putative miR-376c target site in the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of both UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 mRNAs. In accordance with the possibility that this miRNA negatively regulates UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression, there is an inverse correlation in the levels of miR-376c and UGT2B15/UGT2B17 mRNAs in prostate cancer cell lines versus normal prostate tissue. In LNCaP cells, transfection of miR-376c mimics inhibited the glucuronidations of testosterone, 4-methylumbelliferone (a substrate of UGT2B15), and androsterone (a substrate of UGT2B17). miR-376c reduced both UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 mRNA and protein levels and the activity of luciferase reporters containing UGT2B15 or UGT2B17 3'-UTRs. This microRNA-mediated repression was significantly abrogated by mutating the miR-376c binding site in the 3'-UTRs of both UGTs. Collectively, these data indicate that the expression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 is negatively regulated by the binding of miR-376c to the 3'-UTRs of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in prostate cancer cells. This represents the first evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by miRNAs in prostate cancer cells and may have importance in regulating androgen receptor signaling.""","""['Dhilushi D Wijayakumara', 'Dong Gui Hu', 'Robyn Meech', 'Ross A McKinnon', 'Peter I Mackenzie']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Epigenetic regulation of steroid inactivating UDP-glucuronosyltransferases by microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 by miR-331-5p in Prostate Cancer Cells Involves Canonical and Noncanonical Target Sites.', ""Identification and validation of the microRNA response elements in the 3'-untranslated region of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B15 genes by a functional genomics approach."", 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Characterization and regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in steroid target tissues.', 'The Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) superfamily: the role in tumor cell metabolism.', 'Identification of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15) as a Target for IGF1 and Insulin Action.', 'Coordinated Regulation of UGT2B15 Expression by Long Noncoding RNA LINC00574 and hsa-miR-129-5p in HepaRG Cells.', 'Current trends in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.', '6-Formylindolo3,2-bcarbazole (FICZ) Enhances The Expression of Tumor Suppressor miRNAs, miR-22, miR-515-5p, and miR-124-3p in MCF-7 Cells.']"""

Efficient and user-friendly tools are critical in carrying out such analysis on high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data. However, existing tools are either not scalable well, or inadequate in providing visualization and other desirable functionalities.  Results:   In order to handle ultra large sequencing data and to provide additional functions and features, we have developed BSPAT, a fast online tool for bisulfite sequencing pattern analysis. With a user-friendly web interface, BSPAT seamlessly integrates read mapping/quality control/methylation calling with methylation pattern generation and visualization. BSPAT has the following important features: 1) instead of using multiple/pairwise sequence alignment methods, BSPAT adopts an efficient and widely used sequence mapping tool to provide fast alignment of sequence reads; 2) BSPAT summarizes and visualizes DNA methylation co-occurrence patterns at a single nucleotide level, which provide valuable information in understanding the mechanism and regulation of DNA methylation; 3) based on methylation co-occurrence patterns, BSPAT can automatically detect potential allele-specific methylation (ASM) patterns, which can greatly enhance the detection and analysis of ASM patterns; 4) by linking directly with other popular databases and tools, BSPAT allows users to perform integrative analysis of methylation patterns with other genomic features together within regions of interest.  Conclusion:   By utilizing a real bisulfite sequencing dataset generated from prostate cancer cell lines, we have shown that BSPAT is highly efficient. It has also reported some interesting methylation co-occurrence patterns and a potential allele-specific methylation case.

Study design:   53 patients underwent s-RARP at our institution. Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes were compared between propensity matched cohorts.  Results:   Patients in the s-RARP group were at significantly higher risk based on the D'Amico classification system (p = 0.010). Estimated blood loss, complication rate, hospital stay, BCR risk, persistent cancer and time to return of potency were similar between groups (full nerve spare [NS] n = 22). In the s-RARP cohort there was a higher prevalence of lymphovascular invasion (26.4% versus 13.2%; p = 0.032), time to catheter removal and a higher prevalence of anastomotic leaks in the postoperative period (34.0% vs 5.7%, p < 0.010). The hazard ratio for return to potency regardless of nerve sparing in the s-RARP group was 0.47 (95% CI 0.25-0.88). Significantly more patients undergoing primary RARP with partial nerve sparing (NS) recovered continence (p < 0.001) and potency (p = 0.043) compared to partial NS s-RARP patients.

Roles for pituitary GH in cancer are therefore well established. The expression of the GH gene is, however, not confined to the pituitary gland and it is now known to occur in many extrapituitary tissues, in which it has local autocrine or paracrine actions, rather than endocrine function. It is, for instance, expressed in cancers of the prostate, lung, skin, endometrium and colon. The oncogenicity of autocrine GH may also be greater than that induced by endocrine or exogenous GH, as higher concentrations of GHR antagonists are required to inhibit its actions. This may reflect the fact that autocrine GH is thought to act at intracellular receptors directly after synthesis, in compartments not readily accessible to endocrine (or exogenous) GH. The roles and actions of extrapituitary GH in cancer may therefore differ from those of pituitary GH. The possibility that GH may be expressed and act in glioma tumors was therefore examined by immunohistochemistry. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of abundant GH- and GH receptor (GHR-) immunoreactivity in glioma, in which they were co-localized in cytoplasmic but not nuclear compartments. These results demonstrate that glioma differs from most cancers in lacking nuclear GHRs, but GH is nevertheless likely to have autocrine or paracrine actions in the induction and progression of glioma.""","""['Robert W Lea', 'Timothy Dawson', 'Carlos G Martinez-Moreno', 'Nasra El-Abry', 'Steve Harvey']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Gen Comp Endocrinol""","""['Autocrine/paracrine roles of extrapituitary growth hormone and prolactin in health and disease: An overview.', 'Extrapituitary growth hormone and growth?', 'Extrapituitary growth hormone.', 'Growth hormone in the nervous system: autocrine or paracrine roles in retinal function?', 'Growth hormone and growth?', 'Investigational Microbiological Therapy for Glioma.', 'Primary Malignant Brain Tumors following Systemic Malignancies: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Identification of growth hormone receptor as a relevant target for precision medicine in low-EGFR expressing glioblastoma.', 'Noncontrast MRI Protocol for Selected Pediatric Pituitary Endocrinopathies: A Procedure with High Diagnostic Yield and Potential to Reduce Anesthesia and Gadolinium-Based Contrast Exposure.', 'Growth Hormone Upregulates Mediators of Melanoma Drug Efflux and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition In Vitro and In Vivo.']"""

Here, we combined three distinct approaches: multiethnic fine-mapping, putative functional annotation (based upon epigenetic data and genome-encoded features), and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, in an attempt to reduce this complexity. We examined 67 risk regions using genotyping and imputation-based fine-mapping in populations of European (cases/controls: 8600/6946), African (cases/controls: 5327/5136), Japanese (cases/controls: 2563/4391) and Latino (cases/controls: 1034/1046) ancestry.

The two groups were comparable with respect to patient demographics, estimated blood loss, drainage time, duration of catheterization, catheterization rate >14 days, complication rate, postoperative hospitalization, and postoperative functional and oncologic outcomes (p > 0.05). The SPOPL-RP procedures had a longer mean operative time (170.1 minutes vs. 139.5 minutes, p = 0.005), but with fewer patients requiring analgesics (20% vs. 54.1%, p = 0.038) and earlier resumption of oral intake (20.7 hours vs. 26.8 hours, p = 0.037). The mean scar length in the SPOPL-RP group was much smaller (3.4 cm vs. 5.8 cm, p = 0.000) owing to the significant reduction of the skin incision. The peri- and postoperative outcomes of SPOPL-RP for low-risk prostate cancer are comparable to those with the standard laparoscopic approach.

The purpose of this retrospective investigation was to evaluate the volume and dimensions of nodes identified by Glu-urea-Lys-(Ahx)-[(68)Ga(HBED-CC)] ((68)Ga-PSMA-11) in the setting of recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   All PET/CT images were acquired 60 ± 10 min after intravenous injection of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 (mean dose 176 MBq). In 21 patients with recurrent prostate cancer and rising PSA, 49 PSMA-positive lymph nodes were identified. Using semiautomated lymph node segmentation software, node volume and short-axis and long-axis dimensions were measured and compared with the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). Round nodes greater than or equal to 8 mm were considered positive by morphological criteria alone. The percentage of nodes identified by elevated SUVmax but not by conventional morphological criteria was determined.  Results:   The mean volume of (68)Ga-PSMA-11-positive nodes was 0.5 ml (range 0.2 - 2.3 ml), and the mean short-axis diameter was 5.8 mm (range 2.4 - 13.3 mm). In 7 patients (33.3 %) with 31 PSMA-positive nodes only 11 (36 %) were morphologically positive based on diameters >8 mm on CT. In the remaining 14 patients (66.7 %), 18 (37 %) of PSMA positive lymph nodes had short-axis diameters <8 mm with a mean short-axis diameter of 5.0 mm (range 2.4 - 7.9 mm). Thus, in this population, (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT detected nodal recurrence in two-thirds of patients who would have been missed using conventional morphological criteria.

We investigate the mechanism of action of compound 1 in A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Whole-transcriptome sequencing identified three missense mutations in the mitochondrial genome of this cell line, coding for ND5, a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) in the electron transport chain. ND5 is a proton pump, helping to maintain the coupling gradient in mitochondria. The identified mutations correspond to known protein variants (p.I257V, p.N447S, and p.L517P), not reported previously in epithelial ovarian cancer. Time-series RNA sequencing suggested that osmium-exposed A2780 cells undergo a metabolic shunt from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, where defective machinery, associated with mutations in complex I, could enhance activity. Downstream events, measured by time-series reverse-phase protein microarrays, high-content imaging, and flow cytometry, showed a dramatic increase in mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent DNA damage with up-regulation of ATM, p53, and p21 proteins. In contrast to platinum drugs, exposure to this organo-osmium compound does not cause significant apoptosis within a 72-h period, highlighting a different mechanism of action. Superoxide production in ovarian, lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancer cells exposed to three other structurally related organo-Os(II) compounds correlated with their antiproliferative activity.

A few studies indicate that health literacy influences cancer patients' health-related quality of life, but additional investigation is needed. The authors examined the relation between health literacy and health-related quality of life among cancer patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with cancer patients in Wisconsin during 2006-2007. Data on sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life, and health literacy were obtained from the state's cancer registry and a mailed questionnaire. Regression analyses were used to characterize the association between health-related quality of life and health literacy. The study sample included 1,841 adults, newly diagnosed with lung, breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer in 2004 (response rate = 68%). Health-related quality of life was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Adjusting for confounders, higher health literacy was associated with greater health-related quality of life (p < .0001). Controlling for covariates, we found significant differences between those in the highest and lowest health literacy categories (p < .0001) and in the physical (p < .0001), functional (p < .0001), emotional (p < .0001), and social (p = .0007) well-being subscales. These associations exceeded the minimally important difference threshold for overall health-related quality of life and functional well-being. Health literacy is positively and independently associated with health-related quality of life among cancer patients. These findings support adoption of health literacy best practices by cancer care systems.""","""['Julie L Halverson', 'Ana P Martinez-Donate', 'Mari Palta', 'Ticiana Leal', 'Sam Lubner', 'Matthew C Walsh', 'Jeanne Schaaf Strickland', 'Paul D Smith', 'Amy Trentham-Dietz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Health Commun""","""['The association between quality of life(QOL) and health literacy among junior middle school students: a cross-sectional study.', 'Health literacy and urbanicity among cancer patients.', 'Effect of Health Literacy on Quality of Life amongst Patients with Ischaemic Heart Disease in Australian General Practice.', 'Health Literacy in Adult Oncology: An Integrative Review.', 'The relationship between health literacy and quality of life among hemodialysis patients: An integrative review.', 'Documenting limited health literacy in a clinical setting.', 'Ki67 as a Predictor of Response to PARP Inhibitors in Platinum Sensitive BRCA Wild Type Ovarian Cancer: The MITO 37 Retrospective Study.', 'Proximal Humerus Fracture: An Evaluation of the Readability and Value of Web-Based Knowledge.', 'The Association of Health Literacy with Health-Related Quality of Life in Youth and Young Adults with Spina Bifida: A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Health-related quality of life and health literacy in patients with systemic mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome.']"""

However, half of the patients do not respond to treatment and those do respond eventually become refractory. A better understanding of the resistance mechanisms to taxane chemotherapy is both urgent and clinical significant, as taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) are being used in various clinical settings. Sustained signaling through the androgen receptor (AR) has been established as a hallmark of CRPC. Recently, splicing variants of AR (AR-Vs) that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD) have been identified. These variants are constitutively active and drive prostate cancer growth in a castration-resistant manner. In taxane-resistant cell lines, we found the expression of a major variant, AR-V7, was upregulated. Furthermore, ectopic expression of two clinically relevant AR-Vs (AR-V7 and ARV567es), but not the full-length AR (AR-FL), reduced the sensitivities to taxanes in LNCaP cells. Treatment with taxanes inhibited the transcriptional activity of AR-FL, but not those of AR-Vs. This could be explained, at least in part, due to the inability of taxanes to block the nuclear translocation of AR-Vs. Through a series of deletion constructs, the microtubule-binding activity was mapped to the LBD of AR. Finally, taxane-induced cytoplasm sequestration of AR-FL was alleviated when AR-Vs were present. These findings provide evidence that constitutively active AR-Vs maintain the AR signaling axis by evading the inhibitory effects of microtubule-targeting agents, suggesting that these AR-Vs play a role in resistance to taxane chemotherapy.""","""['Guanyi Zhang', 'Xichun Liu', 'Jianzhuo Li', 'Elisa Ledet', 'Xavier Alvarez', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Xueqi Fu', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Yan Dong', 'Haitao Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants determine taxane sensitivity in prostate cancer.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Crosstalk between Microtubule Stabilizing Agents and Prostate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Transcriptomic Determinants and the Effect of Inhibiting Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling by XAV939.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'Preliminary mechanistic insights of a brain-penetrant microtubule imaging PET ligand in a tau-knockout mouse model.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Hence, further comprehension of PC metastasis is highly appreciated for improving the levels of therapy. We have previously shown that Adiponectin reduces the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in PCs to suppress tumor-associated neovascularization, possibly through AMPK/mTor signaling. Here, we studied the regulation of Adiponectin signaling in PCs.  Methods:   We analyzed the levels and correlation of Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and microRNA-323 (miR-323) in the PC specimen, compared to the paired normal prostate tissue. We analyzed the binding of miR-323 to the 3'UTR of AdipoR1 mRNA and its effects on AdipoR1 translation by bioinformatics analysis and by luciferase-reporter assay, respectively. We modified miR-323 levels in PC cells, and examined the effects on the expression of AdipoR1 and VEGF-A, as well as on vessel formation in a human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transwell collagen gel assay.  Results:   We detected significantly lower levels of AdipoR1 and significantly higher levels of miR-323 in PC specimen. Moreover, the levels of AdipoR1 and miR-323 are inversely correlated. Moreover, miR-323 was found to bind to the 3’UTR of AdipoR1 mRNA to inhibit its translation. Overexpression of miR-323 in PC cells decreased AdipoR1 protein levels, whereas inhibition of miR-323 increased AdipoR1 protein levels, without affecting AdipoR1 transcripts. Moreover, overexpression of miR-323 increased the levels of VEGF-A and the vessel formation by HUVECs, while inhibition of miR- 323 decreased the levels of VEGF-A and the vessel formation by HUVECs.

Re-expression of either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms of AKR1C3 partially rescued AR activity and growth defects in Siah2 knockdown cells, suggesting a nonenzymatic role for AKR1C3 in these outcomes. Unexpectedly, AKR1C3 re-expression in Siah2 knockdown cells elevated Siah2 protein levels, whereas AKR1C3 knockdown had the opposite effect. We further found that AKR1C3 can bind Siah2 and inhibit its self-ubiquitination and degradation, thereby increasing Siah2 protein levels.

PBRT was administered to 134 patients (the PBRT group), while the remaining 29 patients (the WPRT group) received WPRT.  Results:   Median follow-up was 57 months (range 18-122 months). In the propensity score-matched cohort, the 4-year bRFS of the WPRT group was significantly higher compared to the PBRT group (63.1 vs. 43.4%, p = 0.034). Subgroup analysis showed that the bRFS of patients who had two or more risk factors (seminal vesicle invasion, Roach score for lymph node invasion ≥ 45%, and number of harvested lymph nodes ≤ 5) and were treated with WPRT was significantly improved compared to those who received PBRT (hazard ratio, HR 0.33; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.13-0.83; p = 0.018).  Conclusion:   Elective WPRT for SRT may improve bRFS in patients with unfavorable risk factors.

However, clear parameters for selecting the right patient for each strategy are not available, and new biomarkers and treatment modalities are needed. Low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP) could present such a target.  Objective:   To correlate expression levels of LMWPTP in primary PCa to clinical outcome, and determine the role of LMWPTP in prostate tumor cell biology.  Design, setting, and participants:   Acid phosphatase 1, soluble (ACP1) expression was analyzed on microarray data sets, which were subsequently used in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a tissue microarray containing material of 481 PCa patients whose clinicopathologic data were recorded. PCa cell line models were used to investigate the role of LMWPTP in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and anoikis resistance.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association between LMWPTP expression and clinical and pathologic outcomes was calculated using chi-square correlations and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Functional consequences of LMWPTP overexpression or downregulation were determined using migration and adhesion assays, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and proliferation assays.  Results and limitations:   LMWPTP expression was significantly increased in human PCa and correlated with earlier recurrence of disease (hazard ratio [HR]:1.99; p<0.001) and reduced patient survival (HR: 1.53; p=0.04). Unbiased Ingenuity analysis comparing cancer and normal prostate suggests migratory propensities in PCa. Indeed, overexpression of LMWPTP increases PCa cell migration, anoikis resistance, and reduces activation of focal adhesion kinase/paxillin, corresponding to decreased adherence.  Conclusions:   Overexpression of LMWPTP in PCa confers a malignant phenotype with worse clinical outcome. Prospective follow-up should determine the clinical potential of LMWPTP overexpression.  Patient summary:   These findings implicate low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase as a novel oncogene in prostate cancer and could offer the possibility of using this protein as biomarker or target for treatment of this disease.""","""['Roberta R Ruela-de-Sousa', 'Elmer Hoekstra', 'A Marije Hoogland', 'Karla C Souza Queiroz', 'Maikel P Peppelenbosch', 'Andrew P Stubbs', 'Karin Pelizzaro-Rocha', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Guido Jenster', 'Hiroshi Aoyama', 'Carmen V Ferreira', 'Gwenny M Fuhler']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase as signaling hub of cancer hallmarks.', 'Immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 predicts outcome after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Overexpressed Rce1 is positively correlated with tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP) upregulation mediates malignant potential in colorectal cancer.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Multiparametric MRI radiomics in prostate cancer for predicting Ki-67 expression and Gleason score: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases: Mechanisms in Cancer.', 'Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase as signaling hub of cancer hallmarks.', 'LMWPTP modulates the antioxidant response and autophagy process in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells.', 'A Multi-Institutional Validation of Gleason Score Derived from Tissue Microarray Cores.']"""

The aim of the study was to develop the first nomogram for predicting LNI in PCa patients undergoing sentinel guided pelvic lymph node dissection (sPLND).  Materials and methods:   Analysis was performed on 1,296 patients with PCa who underwent radioisotope guided sPLND and retropubic radical prostatectomy (2005-2010). Median prostate specific antigen (PSA): 7.4 ng/ml (IQR 5.3-11.5 ng/ml). Clinical T-categories: T1: 54.8%, T2: 42.4%, T3: 2.8%. Biopsy Gleason sums: ≤ 6: 55.1%, 7: 39.5%, ≥ 8: 5.4%. Multivariate logistic regression models tested the association between all of the above predictors and LNI. Regression-based coefficients were used to develop a nomogram for predicting LNI. Accuracy was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC).  Results:   The median number of LNs removed was 10 (IQR 7-13). Overall, 17.8% of patients (n = 231) had LNI. The nomogram had a high predictive accuracy (AUC of 82%). All the variables were statistically significant multivariate predictors of LNI (p = 0.001). Univariate predictive accuracy for PSA, Gleason sum and clinical stage was 69, 75 and 69%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The sentinel nomogram can predict LNI at a sPLND very accurately and, for the first time, aid clinicians and patients in making important decisions on the indication of a sPLND.

Therefore, we quantified the incidence rate and cumulative incidence of second primary cancers (SPC) and standardised incidence ratios (SIR) in a population-based cohort of subjects diagnosed with a first primary cancer (FPC).  Methods:   We evaluated a cohort of cancer patients from the Portuguese North Region Cancer Registry (RORENO), with the first diagnosis in 2000-2003 (n = 39451), to estimate the incidence rate and cumulative incidence of SPC and standardised incidence ratios (SIR), for different periods of follow-up, up to 5 years; SPC were defined according to the International Association of Cancer Registries and the International Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines.  Results:   The incidence rate of SPC was more than 5-fold higher in the first 2 months of follow-up than in the period between 2 months and 5 years (metachronous SPC), across which the incidence rates were relatively stable. Cancer survivors had an overall higher incidence rate of cancer than the general population (SIR = 1.31 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.25-1.38)), although that difference faded when only metachronous SPC were considered (SIR = 1.02 (95 % CI, 0.96-1.08)). Cancer incidence rates were higher among female lung FPC survivors and lower in prostate FPC cancer survivors than in the general population. The 5-year cumulative risk of developing a metachronous SPC was 3.0 % and reached nearly 5.0 % among patients with FPC associated with lower risk of death.  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors had higher incident rates of cancer that the general population, especially due to diagnoses in the first months following the FPC. Nevertheless, after this period SPC remain frequent events among cancer survivors.  Implications for cancer survivors:   SPC constitute an important dimension of the burden of cancer survivorship, and this needs to be taken into account when defining strategies for surveillance, prevention and counselling.""","""['Luís Pacheco-Figueiredo', 'Luís Antunes', 'Maria José Bento', 'Nuno Lunet']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Risk of second primary cancers among patients with a first primary gastric cancer: A population-based study in North Portugal.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Evaluation of the frequency of and survival from second primary cancers in North Portugal: a population-based study.', 'What is the most appropriate period to define synchronous cancers?', 'Risk of extracolonic second primary cancers following a primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Incidence and relative risk of metachronous second primary cancers for 16 cancer sites, Osaka, Japan, 2000-2015: Population-based analysis.', 'The clinicopathological features of second primary cancer in patients with prior breast cancer.']"""

A novel and sensitive multiplex biosensor was developed by immobilizing plasmonic nanoparticles in a site-specific manner and functionalized with monoclonal antibodies that recognize the target protein on hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterned glass slide. The proposed multi-analyte biosensor exhibited outstanding selectivity and sensitivity. The limit of detection was determined to be 91 fM, 94 fM and 10 fM for AFP, CEA and PSA from patient-mimicked serum, respectively.

Methods:   Expression of EphA2 protein in non-metastatic RCC (Caki-2 and A498), metastatic RCC cells (Caki-1 and ACHN), HEK-293 cells and prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU-145; positive controls of EphA2 expression) was evaluated by Western blot. Changes in mRNA or protein expression of EphA2, FAK or membrane-bound RhoA following EphA2, FAK or RhoA small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. The effect of siRNA treatment on cellular viability, apoptosis and invasion was analyzed by cell counting kit-8, Annexin-V and modified Matrigel-Boyden assays, respectively.  Results:   In all RCC cell lines, the expression of EphA2 protein was detectable at variable levels; however, in HEK-293 cells, EphA2 expression was very low. Treatment with EphA2 siRNA significantly reduced the expression of EphA2 mRNA and protein in all RCC cell lines. For non-metastatic RCC cells (Caki-2 and A498) but not metastatic RCC cells (Caki-1 and ACHN), cellular viability, invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis, expression of membrane-bound RhoA protein and FAK phosphorylation were significantly decreased in EphA2 siRNA-treated cells compared to the control. In non-metastatic RCC cells, FAK siRNA significantly attenuated the invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis, as well as expression of membrane-bound RhoA protein without changing protein expression of EphA2. RhoA siRNA significantly decreased the malignant cellular behavior and expression of membrane-bound RhoA protein without changing EphA2 protein expression or FAK phosphorylation.

Results:   100 of 161 invited patients participated. There were more females (69 vs. 48%; P = 0.004), breast cancer patients (46 vs. 25%; P = 0.007), non-smokers (87 vs. 74%; P = 0.041), younger (mean age 60 vs. 67 yrs; P < 0.001) and fitter (82 vs. 64% with EGOC 0; P = 0.036) participants vs. non-participants included. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, age (Odds Ratio 0.94, 95% Confidence Interval 0.91, 0.97) and smoking (0.42, 0.18, 0.99) were negatively associated with participation. After 4 months, 63 participants were still participating. Cancer type, smoking and age increased the probability of dropping out. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that age was the only significant determinant of 4 month participation (0.95, 0.91, 0.99). Patients aged >70 years were less likely to participate at baseline and 4 months.  Conclusion:   Individualized lifestyle interventions in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy appear to facilitate a high participation rate that declines with increasing age; both during the enrollment process and completing the intervention. Neither oncologic nor socioeconomic variables deterred participation.""","""['Karianne Vassbakk-Brovold', 'Sveinung Berntsen', 'Liv Fegran', 'Henrik Lian', 'Odd Mjåland', 'Svein Mjåland', 'Stephen Seiler', 'Christian Kersten']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Lifestyle changes in cancer patients undergoing curative or palliative chemotherapy: is it feasible?', 'Experiences of Patients With Breast Cancer of Participating in a Lifestyle Intervention Study While Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy.', ""Palliative Cancer Patients' Experiences of Participating in a Lifestyle Intervention Study While Receiving Chemotherapy."", ""Cancer Patients' Long-term Experiences of Participating in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention Study While Receiving Chemotherapy."", 'Integrative Treatment for Colorectal Cancer: A Comprehensive Approach.', 'Do Breast Cancer Patients Manage to Participate in an Outdoor, Tailored, Physical Activity Program during Adjuvant Breast Cancer Treatment, Independent of Health and Socio-Demographic Characteristics?', 'Lifestyle Medicine Interventions in Patients With Advanced Disease Receiving Palliative or Hospice Care.', 'Patient preference and timing for exercise in breast cancer care.', 'Dietary Guidelines for Breast Cancer Patients: A Critical Review.', 'Synergic Effect of α-Mangostin on the Cytotoxicity of Cisplatin in a Cervical Cancer Model.']"""

In order to gain insight into the full scope of coding HOXB13 mutations in Portuguese prostate cancer patients, we decided to sequence the entire coding region of the HOXB13 gene in 462 early-onset or familial/hereditary cases. Additionally, we searched for somatic HOXB13 mutations in 178 prostate carcinomas to evaluate their prevalence in prostate carcinogenesis. Three different patients were found to carry in their germline DNA two novel missense variants, which were not identified in 132 control subjects. Both variants are predicted to be deleterious by different in silico tools. No somatic mutations were found. These findings further support the hypothesis that different rare HOXB13 mutations may be found in different ethnic groups.

Further it aimed to report the financial cost of these admissions.  Subjects & methods:   The Department of Health's Victorian Admitted Episodes Data Set was used to identify those patients who underwent TRUS biopsy in Victoria who were subsequently readmitted within 7 days to any Victorian hospital with infective complications from July 2007 to June 2012. All Victorian public and private hospitals were included. Patients were excluded if their biopsy was performed during a multi-day admission. Financial costing data was obtained where available from the Department Of Health and Human Services for readmissions with post-TRUS infection where available and adjusted to 2012 prices. Institutional ethics committee approval was granted for this study.  Results:   Thirty-four thousand eight hundred and sixty-five TRUS biopsies were performed in the 5-year period. 1276 (3.66%) were readmitted to a Victorian hospital within 7 days. 604 (1.73%) of these were readmitted with a biopsy-related infection. No significant trend in sepsis rates was seen in 5 years. The median readmission LOS was 4 days. The total burden of readmissions was 3 686 days over 5 years. One patient readmitted with a biopsy related infection died during that episode of care. 20 051 (57.51%) of biopsies resulted in a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Subjects without follow up data, Gleason grade, pathological stage were excluded as were those who had pT4 disease or received neoadjuvant treatment. 1967 cases (91.3% of total) met the inclusion criteria for this study. Tumour characteristics were collated via a central registry. We used competing hazards regression models to investigate associations.  Results:   At median follow up of 10.3 years pT stage of RP (P < 0.001) and high Gleason score of the RP specimen (P < 0.001 for ≥8 [Subhazard ratio (SHR) 11.19] and 4 + 3 = 7 [SHR 7.10]) compared with Gleason score 6 disease were strong predictors of progression to PCSM. Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 was not at this time a significant predictor of PCSM (P = 0.08, SHR 1.84). Predictors of PCSM, independent of stage and grade, included rural residency (P = 0.003), primary surgeon contributing less than 40 cases (low-volume) to the VRPR (P = 0.025) and the involvement of a trainee surgeon in the operation (P = 0.031).  Conclusion:   The significant prediction of PCSM by pT cancer stage, Gleason score and primary Gleason pattern at RP in this whole of population study suggests a need to avoid understaging/grading in the process of cancer diagnosis and active surveillance protocols. Multi-modality therapy is likely to have a greater impact on PCSM in higher stage and Gleason grade disease.

Results:   Differences between the two groups, considering age, American Society of Anesthesiologist score, total PSA, prostate volume, anesthesia duration, and cancer presence, were not statistically significant. Pain experienced during probe insertion, biopsy, and 30 minutes after biopsy was significantly lower in the low-dose spinal anesthesia group (P < 0.0001). Anal sphincter relaxation degree was significantly higher in the spinal group (P < 0.001). Patient procedure-related overall satisfaction level was significantly higher in the spinal anesthesia group (P < 0.001). In the spinal anesthesia group, no motor blockade was observed.

We recently reported that amino acids (a.a.) 50-250 of the NTD are capable of modulating AR nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. To further explore the mechanism associated with a.a. 50-250, GFP pull-down assays were performed in C4-2 CRPC cells transfected with GFP tagged a.a. 50-250 of the AR. Mass spectrometry analysis of the pulled down proteins identified poly (A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) interaction with this region of the AR. In silico analysis of gene expression data revealed PABPC1 up-regulation in prostate cancer tissue specimens and this up-regulation correlates to increased disease recurrence. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the association of PABPC1 with a.a. 50-250 of the NTD of the AR. Knockdown of PABPC1 decreased nuclear AR protein levels and inhibited androgen activation of the AR target PSA in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. Additionally, knockdown of PABPC1 inhibited transactivation of the PSA promoter by NAR (AR lacking the LBD) and attenuated proliferation of AR-positive prostate cancer cells.

In contrast to cells that expressed the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb, we have shown that in retinoblastoma cell lines that do not express Rb, anti-ILK therapies induced aberrant mitosis that led to the accumulation of temporarily viable multinucleated cells. The present work was undertaken to: 1) determine the ultimate fate of cells that had survived anti-ILK therapies and 2) determine whether or not Rb expression altered the outcome of these cells. Our data indicate that ILK, a chemotherapy drug target is expressed in both well-differentiated, Rb-negative and relatively undifferentiated, Rb-positive retinoblastoma tissue. We show that small molecule targeting of ILK in Rb-positive and Rb-deficient cancer cells results in increased centrosomal declustering, aberrant mitotic spindle formation and multinucleation. However, anti-ILK therapies in vitro have different outcomes in retinoblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines that depend on Rb expression. TUNEL labeling and propidium iodide FACS analysis indicate that Rb-positive cells exposed to anti-ILK therapies are more susceptible to apoptosis and senescence than their Rb-deficient counterparts wherein aberrant mitosis induced by anti-ILK therapies exhibit mitotic arrest instead. These studies are the first to show a role for ILK in chemotherapy-induced senescence in Rb-positive cancer lines.

Previous studies have suggested that prostate cancer cell proliferation is induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) exposure, but the mechanism of this induction remains unknown. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferative response of prostate cancer cell to the interaction of AGEs and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). To investigate this mechanism, we used Western blotting to evaluate the responses of the retinoblastoma (Rb), p-Rb and PI3K/Akt pathway to AGEs stimulation. We also examined the effect of knocking down Rb and blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway on AGEs induced PC-3 cell proliferation. Our results indicated that AGE-RAGE interaction enhanced Rb phosphorylation and subsequently decreased total Rb levels. Bioinformatics analysis further indicated a negative correlation between RAGE and RB1 expression in prostate cancer tissue. Furthermore, we observed that AGEs stimulation activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and that blocking PI3K/Akt signaling abrogated AGEs-induced cell proliferation.

We investigated the relationship of HSP27 and c-FLIP expression to prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score sum (GSS), and pathologic stage.  Materials and methods:   Samples from 163 patients between May 2004 and April 2010 were analyzed: 83 from patients that had underwent a radical prostatectomy, and 80 from those that underwent transurethral resection of the prostate to alleviate urinary symptoms from benign prostate hyperplasia. c-FLIP and HSP27 expression were observed by immunohistochemistry staining. Samples with less than 5% expression-positive cells were scored as 1, with 5%-50% were scored as 2, and with more than 50% were scored as 3. Local reactions were identified as 0.5 and evaluated.  Results:   Both the presence of HSP27 within the tumor and the number of cancer cells positive for HSP27 were significantly correlated to GSS and pathologic stage (p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001). The same was true for c-FLIP expression (p<0.001). GSS was more highly correlated to HSP27 expression than to c-FLIP expression (r=0.814 for HSP27, r=0.776 for c-FLIP), as was pathologic stage (r=0.592 for HSP27, r=0.554 for c-FLIP).  Conclusions:   In prostate cancer, higher GSS and a more advanced pathologic stage were associated with a higher likelihood of having a HSP27-positive tumor and more HSP27-positive tumor cells. HSP27 expression was correlated with GSS and prostate cancer stage. A more advanced pathologic stage corresponded to a higher likelihood of having a c-FLIP-positive tumor and more c-FLIP-positive tumor cells.

We performed a first-in-human phase I/II study of (89)Zr-DFO-huJ591 ((89)Zr-J591) PET/CT immunoscintigraphy to assess performance characteristics for detecting metastases compared with conventional imaging modalities (CIM) and pathology.  Experimental design:   Fifty patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers were injected with 5 mCi of (89)Zr-J591. Whole-body PET/CT scans were obtained, and images were analyzed for tumor visualization. Comparison was made to contemporaneously obtained bone scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging on a lesion-by-lesion basis and with biopsies of metastatic sites.  Results:   Median standardized uptake value for (89)Zr-J591-positive bone lesions (n = 491) was 8.9 and for soft-tissue lesions (n = 90), it was 4.8 (P < 0.00003). (89)Zr-J591 detected 491 osseous sites compared with 339 by MDP and 90 soft-tissue lesions compared with 124 by computed tomography (CT). Compared with all CIMs combined, (89)Zr-J591 detected an additional 99 osseous sites. Forty-six lesions (21 bone and 25 soft tissue) were biopsied in 34 patients; 18 of 19 (89)Zr-J591-positive osseous sites and 14 of 16 (89)Zr-J591-positive soft tissue sites were positive for prostate cancer. The overall accuracy of (89)Zr-J591 was 95.2% (20 of 21) for osseous lesions and 60% (15 of 25) for soft-tissue lesions.  Conclusions:   (89)Zr-J591 imaging demonstrated superior targeting of bone lesions relative to CIMs. Targeting soft-tissue lesions was less optimal, although (89)Zr-J591 had similar accuracy as individual CIMs. This study will provide benchmark data for comparing performance of proposed prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting agents for prostate cancer.""","""['Neeta Pandit-Taskar', ""Joseph A O'Donoghue"", 'Jeremy C Durack', 'Serge K Lyashchenko', 'Sarah M Cheal', 'Volkan Beylergil', 'Robert A Lefkowitz', 'Jorge A Carrasquillo', 'Danny F Martinez', 'Alex Mak Fung', 'Stephen B Solomon', 'Mithat Gönen', 'Glenn Heller', 'Massimo Loda', 'David M Nanus', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Jarett L Feldman', 'Joseph R Osborne', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'Neil H Bander', 'Howard I Scher', 'Steven M Larson', 'Michael J Morris']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Combined 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET scans in patients with newly progressive metastatic prostate cancer.', '⁸⁹Zr-huJ591 immuno-PET imaging in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer.', '89Zr-DFO-J591 for immunoPET of prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in vivo.', '89Zr-Desferrioxamine B-J591 anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody.', 'Positron emission tomography and bone metastases.', 'Current and potential roles of immuno-PET/-SPECT in CAR T-cell therapy.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Immuno-PET: Design options and clinical proof-of-concept.', 'Tumor-Targeting Ability of Novel Anti-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Antibodies.', 'Current role of prostate-specific membrane antigen-based imaging and radioligand therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

AR signaling is the principal target for prostate cancer treatment, but current androgen-deprivation therapies cannot completely abolish AR signaling because of the heterogeneity of prostate cancers. Therefore, unraveling the mechanism of AR reactivation in androgen-depleted conditions can identify effective prostate cancer therapeutic targets. Increasing evidence indicates that AR activity is mediated by the interplay of modifying/demodifying enzymatic co-regulators. To better understand the mechanism of AR transcriptional activity regulation, we used antibodies against AR for affinity purification and identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 7, USP7 as a novel AR co-regulator in prostate cancer cells. We showed that USP7 associates with AR in an androgen-dependent manner and mediates AR deubiquitination. Sequential ChIP assays indicated that USP7 forms a complex with AR on androgen-responsive elements of target genes upon stimulation with the androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Further investigation indicated that USP7 is necessary to facilitate androgen-activated AR binding to chromatin. Transcriptome profile analysis of USP7-knockdown LNCaP cells also revealed the essential role of USP7 in the expression of a subset of androgen-responsive genes. Hence, inhibition of USP7 represents a compelling therapeutic strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shu-Ting Chen', 'Maiko Okada', 'Ryuichiro Nakato', 'Kosuke Izumi', 'Masashige Bando', 'Katsuhiko Shirahige']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Deubiquitinating enzyme Usp12 is a novel co-activator of the androgen receptor.', 'Proteasome-associated deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 14 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by deubiquitinating and stabilizing androgen receptor.', 'Regulation of FGF8 expression by the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor levels: implications for prostate cancer progression and therapy.', 'Implications of ubiquitin ligases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'The role of ubiquitination in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'Hao-Fountain syndrome and genital disorders: report of a new possible association.', 'Role of ubiquitin specific proteases in the immune microenvironment of prostate cancer: A new direction.', 'Deubiquitinases in Cancers: Aspects of Proliferation, Metastasis, and Apoptosis.']"""

PCA3-277 aptamer ligands were obtained, and the best binding molecule, named CG3, was synthesized for validation. Aiming to prove its diagnostic utility, we used an apta-qPCR assay with CG3-aptamer conjugated to magnetic beads to capture PCA3 transcripts, which were amplified 97-fold and 7-fold higher than conventional qPCR in blood and tissue, respectively. Histopathologic analysis of 161 prostate biopsies arranged in a TMA and marked with biotin-labeled CG3-aptamer showed moderate staining in both cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa samples; in contrast, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples presented strong nuclear staining (78% of the cases). No staining was observed in stromal cells. In addition, using an apta-qPCR, we demonstrated that CG3-aptamer specifically recognizes the conformational PCA3-277 molecule and at least three other transcript variants, indicating that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is processed after transcription.

Methods:   Men aged 40+ years were identified from 18 rural and 13 urban general practices across the Midland Cancer Network region. Computerized practice records were cross-referenced with community laboratory data to ascertain the number and level of PSA tests undertaken in 2010 and 3 years prior. For men with an elevated PSA result in 2010, practice records were searched for information on specialist visits, and they were cross-referenced with histology reports regarding biopsy and prostate cancer diagnosis.  Findings:   The study population included 34,960 men aged 40+ years, of whom 48% were enrolled in rural practices. Men in rural practices were 43% less likely to be screened with a PSA test in 2010, but they were 53% more likely to have an elevated PSA result. The prostate cancer detection rate from all screened men was 6 per 1,000 for rural men compared with 3 per 1,000 for urban men. Rural men were more likely diagnosed with Gleason score 9 tumors and metastatic disease.  Conclusion:   Significant differences were found in PSA screening patterns between rural and urban general practices. Due to lower screening rates, rural men were more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer when screened and also seemed to be diagnosed with more advanced disease compared with urban men.

Identification of molecular subtypes of prostate cancer has opened the opportunity for testing whether biomarkers that characterize these subtypes can be used as biomarkers of prognosis. Two established molecular subtypes are identified by high expression of the ERG oncoprotein, due to structural DNA alterations that encode for fusion transcripts in approximately ½ of prostate cancers, and over-expression of SPINK1, which is purportedly found only in ERG-negative tumors. We used a multi-institutional prostate cancer tissue microarray constructed from radical prostatectomy samples with associated detailed clinical data and with rigorous selection of recurrent and non-recurrent cases to test the prognostic value of immunohistochemistry staining results for the ERG and SPINK1 proteins. In univariate analysis, ERG positive cases (419/1067; 39%) were associated with lower patient age, pre-operative serum PSA levels, lower Gleason scores (≤ 3+4=7) and improved recurrence free survival (RFS). On multivariate analysis, ERG status was not correlated with RFS, disease specific survival (DSS) or overall survival (OS). High-level SPINK1 protein expression (33/1067 cases; 3%) was associated with improved RFS on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Over-expression of either protein was not associated with clinical outcome. While expression of ERG and SPINK1 proteins was inversely correlated, it was not mutually exclusive since 3 (0.28%) cases showed high expression of both. While ERG and SPINK1 appear to identify discrete molecular subtypes of prostate cancer, only high expression of SPINK1 was associated with improved clinical outcome.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis (CoxPH) was performed in order to construct the nomogram. The nomogram was internally validated using the bootstrap technique.  Results:   Overall, the KM estimated 5 year bPFS was 72.8%. Stratified by D'Amico risk, The KM estimated 5 year bPFS was 82.6%, 71.1%, and 57.8% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Statistically significant predictors of biochemical outcomes from CoxPH analysis were pre-treatment prostate specific antigen (PTPSA) (P < 0.001), total prostate volume (P = 0.004), clinical stage (P = 0.034), and Gleason score (0.004). A nomogram for predicted 5 year biochemical progression free probability was constructed with a concordance index of 0.652. An online risk calculator was also generated.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first predictive nomogram for biochemical outcomes after primary whole gland cryoablation of the prostate using socio-demographic, pretreatment, clinical, and prostate biopsy data. Our nomogram and online risk calculator can guide both patients and urologists for shared decision making regarding definitive treatment options.""","""['Ahmed Elshafei', 'Evan Kovac', 'Nivedita Dhar', 'David Levy', 'Thomas Polascik', 'Vladimir Mouraviev', 'Changhong Yu', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Definition of biochemical success following primary whole gland prostate cryoablation.', 'Five-Year Biochemical Progression-Free Survival Following Salvage Whole-Gland Prostate Cryoablation: Defining Success with Nadir Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Predictors of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation.', 'A post-radical-prostatectomy nomogram incorporating new pathological variables and interaction terms for improved prognosis.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Lymph nodes ratio based nomogram predicts survival of resectable gastric cancer regardless of the number of examined lymph nodes.', 'Cryosurgery would be An Effective Option for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.']"""

In this study, we demonstrated that microRNA-7 (miR-7) appears to be a novel tumor-suppressor miRNA, which abrogates the stemness of PCSCs and inhibits prostate tumorigenesis by suppressing a key stemness factor KLF4. MicroRNA-7 is down-regulated in prostate cancer cells compared to non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Restoration of miR-7 suppresses the expression of the stemness factor KLF4 in PCSCs and inhibits prostate tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the suppression of the stemness of PCSCs by miR-7 is sustained for generations in xenografts. Analysis of clinical samples also revealed a negative correlation between miR-7 expression and prostate tumor progression. Mechanistically, overexpression of miR-7 may lead to a cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis, which seems achieved via suppressing the KLF4/PI3K/Akt/p21 pathway.

Regucalcin (RGN), a Ca2+-binding protein that plays a relevant role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, was identified as an under-expressed protein in human PCa. Moreover, RGN was associated with suppression of cell proliferation, suggesting that the loss of RGN may favor development and progression of PCa. This work aims to unveil the role of Ca2+o on RGN expression and viability of non-neoplastic (PNT1A) and neoplastic (LNCaP) prostate cell lines. It was demonstrated that Ca2+o up-regulates RGN expression in both cell lines, but important differences were found between cells for dose- and time-responses to Ca2+o treatment. It was also shown that high [Ca2+]o triggers different effects on cell proliferation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic PCa cells, which seems to be related with RGN expression levels. This suggests the involvement of RGN in the regulation of cell proliferation in response to Ca2+o treatment. Also, the effect of Ca2+o on CaSR expression seems to be dependent of RGN expression, which is strengthened by the fact that RGN-knockdown in PNT1A cells increases the CaSR expression, whereas transgenic rats overexpressing RGN exhibit low levels of CaSR. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of RGN as a regulatory protein in Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways and its deregulation of RGN expression by Ca2+o may contribute for onset and progression of PCa.""","""['Cátia V Vaz', 'Daniel B Rodrigues', 'Sílvia Socorro', 'Cláudio J Maia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Regucalcin is an androgen-target gene in the rat prostate modulating cell-cycle and apoptotic pathways.', 'Suppressed glycolytic metabolism in the prostate of transgenic rats overexpressing calcium-binding protein regucalcin underpins reduced cell proliferation.', 'Aging-associated changes in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis are prevented in the prostate of transgenic rats overexpressing regucalcin.', 'The Emerging Role of Regucalcin as a Tumor Suppressor: Facts and Views.', 'Regucalcin, a calcium-binding protein with a role in male reproduction?', 'RGN as a prognostic biomarker with immune infiltration and ceRNA in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Effects of 6-Month Square Stepping Exercise Intervention on Physical and Cognitive Competence, Regucalcin, and Body Composition in Older People: Study Protocol for a Randomised Control Trial.', 'Enzymatically Crosslinked In Situ Synthesized Silk/Gelatin/Calcium Phosphate Hydrogels for Drug Delivery.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', ""Diabetes and inflammatory diseases: An overview from the perspective of Ca2+/3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling.""]"""

As evident from animal studies, the inconsistency was owing to various degrees of ethanol backflow along the needle tract. In acute canine experiments, we previously documented that using convection enhanced delivery (CED) eliminates backflow and improves ethanol distribution. The goal of this study was to compare the diffusion pattern between a microporous hollow fiber catheter (MiHFC) and a standard needle in human prostates from organ donors.  Methods:   Prostates were harvested from cadaveric organ donors immediately after removal of organs for transplant. After trimming off excess fat and weighing, prostates were injected with absolute ethanol. The total injected volume was 25% of the calculated prostate volume. One lateral lobe was injected using a single lumen 21-gauge control needle. The contralateral lobe was injected with the same volume but using a MiHFC. Immediately after injection, prostates were fixed en bloc in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and then sectioned. Three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to determine lesion volume based on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained cross-sections.  Results:   Three fresh human prostates were harvested and injected. The time from harvest to intraprostatic injection was 15-35 min. The lesion created by the MiHFC was 1.14±0.52 cm(3), whereas that from the control needle was 0.28±0.10 cm(3) (P=0.038). No backflow was observed along the needle tract of the MiHFC.

Therefore, the requirement to develop novel and effective anti-prostate cancer drugs is extremely urgent. Angiogenin has been suggested as a molecular target for prostate cancer treatment; its overexpression contributes to androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth and castration-resistant growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neamine, a low toxicity angiogenin nuclear translocation inhibitor, has preferential anti-prostate cancer activity compared with cis-platinum (DDP) and the mechanisms involved. Immunofluorescence and MTT assays were used to observe the effect of neamine on the nuclear translocation of angiogenin and cell proliferation, and a PC-3 cell transplanted tumor model was used to investigate the in vivo activity of neamine and DDP. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expression of angiogenin, cluster of differentiation (CD)31 and Ki-67. It was found that neamine blocked nuclear translocation of angiogenin effectively and inhibited angiogenin-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell and PC-3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Neamine exerted a comparative antitumor effect, but lower toxicity (weight loss), in the PC-3 xenograft models treated with DDP. Neamine consistently reduced the expression of angiogenin and CD31 significantly, but no difference was found in Ki-67 expression compared with DDP.

[(18)F]5 was synthesized, and cell uptake and internalization studies were conducted in PSMA(+) LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells and PSMA(-) PC-3 cells. In vivo PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed at 1 and 4 h post injection in mice bearing CWR22Rv1 tumor, with or without blocking agent.  Results:   The crystallographic data showed interaction of the p-fluorobenzoyl group with an arene-binding cleft on the PSMA surface. In vitro studies revealed elevated uptake of [(18)F]5 in PSMA(+) cells (2.2% in CWR22Rv1 and 12.1% in LNCaP) compared to PSMA(-) cells (0.08%) at 4 h. In vivo tumor uptake of 2.33% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio of 265:1 was observed at 4 h.  Conclusions:   We have successfully synthesized, radiolabeled and evaluated a new PSMA-targeted PET agent. The crystal structure of the PSMA/5 complex highlighted the interactions within the arene-binding cleft contributing to the overall complex stability. The high target uptake and rapid non-target clearance exhibited by [(18)F]5 in PSMA(+) xenografts substantiates its potential use for PET imaging of PCa.  Advances in knowledge:   The only FDA-approved imaging agent for PCa, Prostascint®, targets PSMA but suffers from inherent shortcomings. The data acquired in this manuscript confirmed that our new generation of [(18)F]-labeled PSMA inhibitor exhibited promising in vivo performance as a PET imaging agent for PCa and is well-positioned for subsequent clinical trials. Implications for Patient Care Our preliminary data demonstrate that this tracer possesses the required imaging characteristics to be sensitive and specific for PCa imaging in patients at all stages of the disease.""","""['Tanushree Ganguly', 'Shorouk Dannoon', 'Mark R Hopkins', 'Stephanie Murphy', 'Hendry Cahaya', 'Joseph E Blecha', 'Salma Jivan', 'Christopher R Drake', 'Cyril Barinka', 'Ella F Jones', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Clifford E Berkman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Structure-Activity Relationship of (18)F-Labeled Phosphoramidate Peptidomimetic Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Targeted Inhibitor Analogues for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of an 18F-labeled phosphoramidate peptidomimetic as a new prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted imaging agent for prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'Identification of alternative protein targets of glutamate-ureido-lysine associated with PSMA tracer uptake in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Turn-on Probe for Imaging Cargo Release in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer Therapy: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives.', 'Nanobodies Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen for the Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

We report here that TβRI interacts with the SH3 domains of the adaptor protein CIN85 in response to TGFβ stimulation in a TRAF6-dependent manner. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CIN85 resulted in accumulation of TβRI in intracellular compartments and diminished TGFβ-stimulated Smad2 phosphorylation.

We evaluated whether patient- and neighborhood-level education is associated with the effect of obesity on biochemical recurrence.  Methods:   Seven hundred and forty-six CaP cases were classified into four groups: Concordant Low-Low: less educated cases (<4 years college) living in a less educated neighborhood (below-median proportion of college-educated residents; n = 164); Concordant High-High: highly educated cases (≥ 4 years college) living in a highly educated neighborhood (above-median proportion of college-educated residents; n = 326); Discordant Low-High: less educated cases living in a highly educated neighborhood (n = 69); and Discordant High-Low: highly educated cases living in a less educated neighborhood (n = 187). Cox regression models were used to examine associations between obesity and biochemical (PSA) failure after prostatectomy stratified by the concordant/discordant groups.  Results:   The association of obesity with biochemical failure varied significantly by educational concordance/discordance (p = 0.007). Obesity was associated with risk of biochemical failure for less educated cases residing in less educated neighborhoods (HR 3.72, 95% CI 1.30-10.65). The relationship was not significant for other concordant/discordant groups.  Conclusions:   Obesity effects on CaP outcomes vary by multilevel educational discordance/concordance.

This gene expression profile may also have a prognostic value in other histological cancer types, and could potentially have a function as a universal hypoxia profile. The hypoxia induced upregulation of the included genes, and the validity of the previously used reference genes was established in this study, in a range of different cell lines representing carcinomas of the prostate, colon, and esophagus.  Materials and methods:   Eleven adenocarcinoma and one squamous cell lines: Six colon carcinomas (HTC8, HT29, LS174T, SW116, SW948 and T48), 3 prostate carcinomas (LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3) and 3 esophagus carcinoma cell lines (OE19, OE21 and OE33) were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (0% O2) for 24hours. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression levels measured by qPCR. For each tissue type, individual reference genes were selected and applied in the normalization of the relative expression levels.  Results:   In all three tissue types, individual, optimal, reference genes were selected. In the analysis of the hypoxia induced genes, both the original reference genes and the new selected reference genes were used. There was no significant difference in the obtained data. The gene expression analysis demonstrated cell line specific differences in the hypoxia response of the 15 genes, with BNIP3 not being upregulated at hypoxic conditions in 3 out of 6 colon cancer cell lines, and ALDOA in OE21 and FAM162A and SLC2A1 in SW116 only showing limited hypoxia induction. Furthermore, in the esophagus cell lines, the normoxic and hypoxic expression levels of LOX and BNIP3 were below the detection limit in OE19 and OE33, respectively. However, a combined analysis of the 15 genes in both adenocarcinoma cell lines and squamous carcinoma cell lines demonstrated a very consistent expression pattern in hypoxic induced gene expression across all cell lines.  Conclusion:   This study addressed the tissue type dependency of hypoxia induced genes included in a 15-gene hypoxic profile in carcinoma cell lines from prostate, colon, and esophagus cancer, and demonstrated that in vitro, with minor fluctuations, the genes in the hypoxic profile are hypoxia inducible, and the hypoxia profile may be applicable in other sites than HNSCC.""","""['Brita Singers Sørensen', 'Anders Knudsen', 'Catja Foged Wittrup', 'Steffen Nielsen', 'Ninna Aggerholm-Pedersen', 'Morten Busk', 'Michael Horsman', 'Morten Høyer', 'Pierre Nourdine Bouchelouche', 'Jens Overgaard', 'Jan Alsner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Hypoxia-regulated gene expression and prognosis in loco-regional gastroesophageal cancer.', 'Development of a hypoxia gene expression classifier with predictive impact for hypoxic modification of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer.', 'Proteins upregulated by mild and severe hypoxia in squamous cell carcinomas in vitro identified by proteomics.', 'Prognostic gene expression profiling in esophageal cancer: a systematic review.', 'Molecular pathogenesis of carcinoma of the esophagus.', 'Radiogenomics Reveals Correlation between Quantitative Texture Radiomic Features of Biparametric MRI and Hypoxia-Related Gene Expression in Men with Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNA Pattern in Hypoxic Microenvironment of Kidney Cancer-Role of PTEN.', 'Robust metabolic transcriptional components in 34,494 patient-derived cancer-related samples and cell lines.', 'Refinement of an Established Procedure and Its Application for Identification of Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer Xenografts.', 'Predictive and prognostic transcriptomic biomarkers in soft tissue sarcomas.']"""

Methods:   Double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-institutional study, evaluated the effects of pomegranate liquid extract on serum PSA levels. The primary end point of this study was change in serum PSADT. Additional secondary and exploratory objectives were to evaluate the safety of pomegranate juice and to determine the interaction of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype and pomegranate treatment on PSADT.  Results:   One-hundred eighty-three eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the active and placebo groups with a ratio of 2:1 (extract N=102; placebo N=64; juice N=17). The majority of adverse events were of moderate or mild grade. Median PSADT increased from 11.1 months at baseline to 15.6 months in the placebo group (P<0.001) compared with an increase from 12.9 months at baseline to 14.5 months in the extract group (P=0.13) and an increase from 12.7 at baseline to 20.3 in the juice group (P=0.004). However, none of these changes were statistically significant between the three groups (P>0.05). Placebo AA patients experienced a 1.8 month change in median PSADT from 10.9 months at baseline to 12.7 months (P=0.22), while extract patients experienced a 12 month change in median PSADT from 13.6 at baseline to 25.6 months (P=0.03).  Conclusions:   Compared with placebo, pomegranate extract did not significantly prolong PSADT in prostate cancer patients with rising PSA after primary therapy.

During androgen synthesis, 5α-reductase encoded by SRD5A catalyses testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone and may be involved in the progression to CRPC. Then, this study aimed to reveal the association between genetic variations in SRD5A and the prognosis in metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   We studied the polymorphisms rs518673 and rs166050 in SRD5A1, and rs12470143, rs523349, rs676033 and rs2208532 in SRD5A2 as well as the time to CRPC progression and overall survival in 104 patients with metastatic prostate cancer that had undergone primary ADT. The association between the polymorphisms and the progression to CRPC as well as overall survival was examined.  Results:   Patients carrying the more active GG genotype in SRD5A2 rs523349 exhibited a higher risk of the progression (hazard ration [95% confidence interval], 1.93 [1.14-3.14], p=0.016) and death (hazard ration [95% confidence interval], 2.14 [1.16-3.76], p=0.016), compared with less active GC/CC genotypes in SRD5A2 rs523349.  Conclusions:   High 5α-reductase activity due to the polymorphism in SRD5A2 may contribute to resistance to ADT.

Given that breast and prostate cancer have remarkable underlying biological similarities and given the important roles of basal cells in prostate cancer, we examined the expression patterns and role of gal-7 in human prostate cancer. Using tissue microarray, we found that although gal-7 is readily expressed in basal cells in normal prostate tissue, it is downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. De novo expression of gal-7 in prostate cancer cells increases their sensitivity to apoptosis in response to etoposide and cisplatin. The assessment of a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD)-defective mutant form of gal-7 (R7S) showed that the ability of this protein to modulate apoptosis was independent of its CRD activity. This activity was also independent of its ability to translocate to the mitochondrial and nuclear compartments. However, CRD activity was necessary to inhibit the invasive behaviors of prostate cancer cells. In vivo, gal-7 overexpression in PCa cells led to a modest yet significant reduction in tumor size, while its CRD-defective mutant form significantly increased tumor growth compared to controls. Taken together, these results suggest that although de novo expression of gal-7 may be an interesting means of increasing the tumorigenic phenotypes of PCa cells, alterations in the CRD activity of this protein drive a phenotypic switch in its role in PCa cells. This CRD-independent activity represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the functions of galectin. The R74S model will be useful to distinguish CRD-dependent and CRD-independent functions of gal-7 in cancer progression.""","""['Marilyne Labrie', 'Maria Vladoiu', 'Bruno G Leclerc', 'Andrée-Anne Grosset', 'Louis Gaboury', 'John Stagg', 'Yves St-Pierre']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cytosolic galectin-7 impairs p53 functions and induces chemoresistance in breast cancer cells.', 'X-ray structure of a protease-resistant mutant form of human galectin-8 with two carbohydrate recognition domains.', 'The second glutamic acid in the C-terminal CRD affects the carbohydrate-binding properties of recombinant galectins of Haemonchus contortus.', 'Galectin-7 in Epithelial Homeostasis and Carcinomas.', ""Integrating structure and function of 'tandem-repeat' galectins."", 'Galectin-7 reprograms skin carcinogenesis by fostering innate immune evasive programs.', 'Mutation of the galectin-3 glycan-binding domain (Lgals3-R200S) enhances cortical bone expansion in male mice and trabecular bone mass in female mice.', 'Assessment of galectins -1, -3, -4, -8, and -9 expression in ovarian carcinoma patients with clinical implications.', 'Functions and Inhibition of Galectin-7, an Emerging Target in Cellular Pathophysiology.', 'Molecular Identification and mRNA Expression Profiles of Galectin-9 Gene in Red Sea Bream (Pagrus major) Infected with Pathogens.']"""

Current practice relies on external beam irradiation or on a variety of medical devices for brachytherapy. Both approaches proved useful in controlling tumor growth, but are characterized by poor compliance of the patient, significant side-effects, high costs, and technological complexity, which hamper widespread use. The authors recently described a novel form of radionuclide therapy based on the oxidized form of avidin that, chemically reacting with tissue proteins, can secure radioactive biotin within the injected tissue, either when precomplexed or when taken from the blood stream after intravenous administration. AvidinOX-pretargeted (177)Lu-biotinDOTA ((177)Lu-ST2210) is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of liver oligometastases from colorectal cancer (clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02053324). In the present work, the authors show that injected AvidinOX can link tissues of various natures such as prostate, kidney, breast, or brain and can react by contact with scraped tissues such as skin or urinary bladder. AvidinOX injected into human OSC19 tongue cancer masses orthotopically transplanted in nude mice takes up intravenously administered (90)Y-ST2210, which exerts significant antitumor activity, while preserving the integrity and functionality of the tongue.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of our prostate cancer database identified robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients between April 2007 and December 2011 who completed pre- and postsurgical (24 months) Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 surveys. Gleason score, margins, D'Amico risk, prostate-specific antigen, radiotherapy, and nerve-sparing status were tabulated. Survey questions addressed urinary irritation/obstruction, incontinence, and overall bother. Responses were averaged to calculate a urinary sum (US) score. Patients were stratified according to the severity of their baseline urinary bother (UB), and changes in urinary indices determined at 24 months.  Results:   A total of 737 patients were included. Postsurgical improvement in urinary obstruction, bother, and sum score was related to baseline UB (P <.001). Men with severe baseline bother had the greatest improvement in US (+9.3), whereas those with asymptomatic baseline UB experienced a decline in US (-2.8). All patients experienced a decline in urinary incontinence of 6.3-8.3 that was independent of baseline bother (P = .507). Patients with severe UB experienced positive outcomes, whereas those at asymptomatic baseline experienced negative US outcomes. Negative urinary incontinence outcomes were unrelated to baseline UB. Age, radiotherapy, and nerve-sparing status were not associated with improved UB (P = .029). However, baseline UB was significantly associated with improvement in postsurgical UB (P = .001).  Conclusion:   Baseline UB is a predictor of postsurgical improvement in urinary function. These data are helpful when counseling a subset of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients with severe preoperative urinary symptoms.""","""['Gregory Murphy', 'Peter Haddock', 'Hoyt Doak', 'Max Jackson', 'Ryan Dorin', 'Anoop Meraney', 'Stuart Kesler', 'Ilene Staff', 'Joseph R Wagner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Urinary and sexual quality of life 1 year following robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of prostate size on urinary quality of life indexes following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of outcomes between pure laparoscopic vs robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a study of comparative effectiveness based upon validated quality of life outcomes.', 'Epidemiology of urinary incontinence in prostate cancer.

Combining of Gleason scores into a three-tiered grouping (6, 7, 8-10) is used most frequently for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are often considered the same prognostic group.  Objective:   To verify that a new grading system accurately produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal therapy data.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2005 and 2014, 20,845 consecutive men were treated by radical prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5501 men were treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcome was based on biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores.  Results and limitations:   In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in recurrence rates between both Gleason 3+4 versus 4+3 and Gleason 8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were 1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9-10, respectively. These differences were attenuated in the radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease but were clearly seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy only. A five-grade group system had the highest prognostic discrimination for all cohorts on both univariable and multivariable analysis. The major limitation was the unavoidable use of prostate-specific antigen BCR as an end point as opposed to cancer-related death.  Conclusions:   The new PCa grading system has these benefits: more accurate grade stratification than current systems, simplified grading system of five grades, and lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.  Patient summary:   We looked at outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and validated a new grading system with more accurate grade stratification than current systems, including a simplified grading system of five grades and a lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.""","""['Jonathan I Epstein', 'Michael J Zelefsky', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Joel B Nelson', 'Lars Egevad', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Samson W Fine', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Misop Han', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Eric A Klein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: A simplified prostate cancer grading system.', 'Detailed Quantification of High-grade Cancer Allows Precise Prediction of Prostate Cancer Prognosis.', 'Three Things About Gleason Grading That Just About Everyone Believes But That Are Almost Certainly Wrong.', 'Clinical Utility of Quantitative Gleason Grading in Prostate Biopsies and Prostatectomy Specimens.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', ""'Stealth' Prostate Tumors."", 'Comparison of Rotterdam and Barcelona Magnetic Resonance Imaging Risk Calculators for Predicting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Characterization of metabolism-associated molecular patterns in prostate cancer.', 'Acquisition Parameters Influence Diffusion Metrics Effectiveness in Probing Prostate Tumor and Age-Related Microstructure.', 'Development and internal validation of a novel nomogram for predicting lymph node invasion for prostate cancer patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.']"""

However, clinical studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding cancer outcomes and cancer risk when β-blockers were used. This study investigated the association between propranolol and cancer risk.Between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2011, a patient cohort was extracted from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, a subset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A propranolol cohort (propranolol usage >6 months) and nonpropranolol cohort were matched using a propensity score. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer associated with propranolol treatment.The study sample comprised 24,238 patients. After a 12-year follow-up period, the cumulative incidence for developing cancer was low in the propranolol cohort (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67-0.85; P < 0.001). Patients with propranolol treatment exhibited significantly lower risks of cancers in head and neck (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.95), esophagus (HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13-0.96), stomach (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30-0.98), colon (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.93), and prostate cancers (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33-0.83). The protective effect of propranolol for head and neck, stomach, colon, and prostate cancers was most substantial when exposure duration exceeded 1000 days.This study supports the proposition that propranolol can reduce the risk of head and neck, esophagus, stomach, colon, and prostate cancers. Further prospective study is necessary to confirm these findings.""","""['Ping-Ying Chang', 'Wen-Yen Huang', 'Cheng-Li Lin', 'Tzu-Chuan Huang', 'Yi-Ying Wu', 'Jia-Hong Chen', 'Chia-Hung Kao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['The effect of propranolol on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: A nationwide population-based study.', 'Carvedilol use is associated with reduced cancer risk: A nationwide population-based cohort study.', 'Impact of selective and nonselective beta-blockers on the risk of severe exacerbations in patients with COPD.', 'Severity of chronic periodontitis and risk of gastrointestinal cancers: A population-based follow-up study from Taiwan.', 'Preadmission Use of Calcium Channel Blocking Agents Is Associated With Improved Outcomes in Patients With Sepsis: A Population-Based Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study.', 'Propranolol restores susceptibility of XDR Gram-negative pathogens to meropenem and Meropenem combination has been evaluated with either tigecycline or amikacin.', 'Harnessing interventions during the immediate perioperative period to improve the long-term survival of patients following radical gastrectomy.', 'Adrenergic receptor signaling regulates the CD40-receptor mediated anti-tumor immunity.', 'Behavioral factors to modulate immunotherapy efficacy in cancer.', 'Cancer Metastasis and Treatment Resistance: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Stem Cells and the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

In palliative care, there is little research studying the correlation between comorbidity and survival in the advanced stages of oncological disease. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of comorbidity, measured with the ACCI, on survival in our patients. Our hypothesis was that higher ACCI scores would be associated with lower survival rates after the first visit.  Method:   We conducted a prospective observational study over one year. Patients were attended by palliative home care teams. The main variables were: survival from metastatic disease after the first visit and ACCI score on the first visit. We also employed a descriptive analysis and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including different ranges of ACCI scores.  Results:   The final sample included 66 subjects. The standard patient was a 76-year-old man with lung cancer who had received chemotherapy. The overall average ACCI score was 10.45. Significant differences were found between the different locations of metastatic disease (greater survivals in breast, ovary, and prostate; p = 0.005) and some treatments (hormone and radiotherapy; p = 0.001 for each), but not from the first visit. We found lower survival rates among lung cancer patients with higher comorbidity (ACCI ≥ 11, p = 0.047), with no differences on other primary locations or overall values.

With SPECT/CT not only the thoracic spine but also the surrounding soft tissue needs to be evaluated for pathological findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of non-osseous findings detectable on low-dose CT datasets from patients studied by thoracic 99mTc-dicarboxypropane diphosphonate (DPD)-SPECT/CT.  Patients, methods:   119 consecutive oncologic patients (81 breast cancer, 38 with other cancer) who underwent DPD-SPECT CT of the thoracic region were included in this study. Non-osseous findings on CT were classified as either probably benign or suspicious. Suspicious findings were correlated with retrievable previous imaging and if performed with follow up imaging (MRI, CT with contrast medium, Ultrasound) or biopsy results.  Results:   In 80/119 (67%) patients no imaging was performed before SPECT/CT. Only 7/119 subjects (6%) had no other lesions than bone lesions. In 101/119 (85%) patients lesions found on SPECT/CT images were rated as benign and in 65/119 (55%) patients as suspicious. In 8/119 (7%) patients with previously unknown suspicious lesions on SPECT/CT images suspicious findings were confirmed by biopsy.  Conclusion:   7% of patients referred to SPECT/CT of the thoracic spine for staging of malignant disease had previously unknown suspicious non-osseous lesions detectable on the low-dose CT images which were confirmed by biopsy.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective analysis included 2,694 patients with localized prostate cancer who received definitive, dose escalated external beam radiotherapy from 1991 to 2008. First recurrence sites were defined as initial sites of clinically detected recurrence and any subsequent clinically detected recurrence within 3 months. Anatomical recurrence patterns were classified as local (prostate/seminal vesicles only), lymphotropic (lymph nodes only) and osteotropic (bones only) in patients with disease confined only to these respective sites for at least 2 years from the initial clinically detected recurrence.  Results:   Prostate was the most common first recurrence site in the low, intermediate and high risk groups with an 8-year cumulative incidence of 3.5%, 9.8% and 14.6%, respectively. The 8-year risk of isolated pelvic lymph node relapse as the first recurrence site was 0%, 1.0% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 474 patients with clinically detected recurrence the most common first recurrence site was local in 55.3%, bone in 33.5%, pelvic lymph nodes in 21.3% and abdominal lymph nodes in 9.1%. Patients showed unique relapse distributions, including a pattern that was local in 41.6%, lymphotropic in 9.7%, osteotropic in 20.3% and multiorgan/visceral in 28.5%. Anatomical recurrence pattern was the strongest predictor of prostate cancer specific mortality on multivariate analysis of patients with clinically detected recurrence.  Conclusions:   The most common first recurrence site after dose escalated external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer is in the prostate and seminal vesicles in all risk groups. In contrast, patients treated without elective pelvic lymph node irradiation are at relatively low risk for isolated pelvic lymph node relapse.

We report the long-term outcome of men who developed biochemical recurrence (BCR) after SRT and were treated >14 years ago.  Methods:   In total, 61 patients treated with SRT from 1992 to 2000 at our institution were identified. Survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox regression were used to determine significance of clinical parameters.  Results:   The median follow-up was 126 months (interquartile range, 66-167 mo). Thirty-four (56%) had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after SRT. At 10 years, overall survival (OS) was 67%, freedom from PSA failure (FFPF) was 33%, prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) was 84%, and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) was 84%. Pathologic T-stage, Gleason score, seminal vesicle involvement, and pre-SRT PSA were associated with FFPF. For patients who failed SRT, the median time to BCR after SRT was 30 mo. A total of 19 (68%) received androgen deprivation therapy. The median OS was 13.6 years. At 10 years from time of BCR, OS was 59%, PCSS was 73%, DMFS was 75%, and castration-resistant-free survival was 70%. Early SRT failure correlated with significantly decreased DMFS and PCSS. Ten-year DMFS from SRT was 43% (BCR≤1 y) versus 91% (BCR>1 y).  Conclusions:   Extended follow-up demonstrates that despite SRT failure, PCSS remains high in select patients. Early failure (≤1 y after SRT) predicted for significantly worse outcome and may represent a subgroup with more aggressive disease that may be considered for further prospective clinical studies.""","""['James Ying', 'Chiachien J Wang', 'Jingsheng Yan', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Christopher Straka', 'David Pistenmaa', 'Xian-Jin Xie', 'Yair Lotan', 'Claus Roehrborn', 'D Nathan Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Improved Metastasis-Free and Survival Outcomes With Early Salvage Radiotherapy in Men With Detectable Prostate-Specific Antigen After Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Outcomes of salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

For PCa at the late hormone-refractory stage, substantial improvement in treatment strategies is critically needed. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent, but both intrinsic and acquired resistance to TRAIL poses a huge problem in establishing clinically effective TRAIL therapies. In the present study, we examined the role played by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the TRAIL‑induced nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) pathway in a PCa cell line. Downregulation of CK2 combined with a sub-dose of TRAIL suppressed p65 phosphorylation at serine 536. The combination treatment of TRAIL and the CK2 inhibitor decreased p65 nuclear translocation. Under the treatment of a sub-dose of TRAIL, downregulation of CK2, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, decreased the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the expression of NF-κB downstream anti-apoptosis genes. Therefore, we provided novel molecular mechanistic insight reporting that CK2 regulates the sensitivity of PCa cells to the antitumor effect of TRAIL. This is important for understanding how the TRAIL pathway is disrupted in PCa and may help to develop an effective combinatorial therapy for PCa.""","""['Xiaokun Gang', 'Yao Wang', 'Yingdi Wang', 'Yu Zhao', 'Liya Ding', 'Jingwen Zhao', 'Lin Sun', 'Guixia Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Role of protein kinase CK2 in antitumor drug resistance.', 'Role of protein kinase CK2 in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Influence of casein kinase II in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.', 'Examination of CK2α and NF-κB p65 expression in human benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer tissues.', 'Emergence of protein kinase CK2 as a key target in cancer therapy.', 'Casein kinase II activates Bik to induce death of hyperplastic mucous cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner.', 'The Preeclamptic Environment Promotes the Activation of Transcription Factor Kappa B by P53/RSK1 Complex in a HTR8/SVneo Trophoblastic Cell Line.', 'Exploring the Potential of MicroRNA Let-7c as a Therapeutic for Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of protein kinase CK2 in antitumor drug resistance.', 'Andrographolide sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.']"""

Studies suggest that carotenoid and tocopherol intake may be associated with PrCA risk and progression. We examined plasma carotenoid and tocopherol levels in relation to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels among men with PSA-defined biochemical recurrence of PrCA.  Methods:   Data analyzed were from a 6-month diet, physical activity and stress-reduction intervention trial conducted in South Carolina among biochemically recurrent PrCA patients (n=39). Plasma carotenoids and tocopherol levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Linear regression was used to estimate least-square means comparing PSA levels of men with high versus low carotenoid/tocopherol levels, adjusting for covariates.  Results:   After adjusting for baseline PSA level, plasma cis-lutein/zeaxanthin level at 3 months was related inversely to PSA level at 3 months (P=0.0008), while α-tocopherol (P=0.01), β-cryptoxanthin (P=0.01), and all-trans-lycopene (P=0.004) levels at 3 months were related inversely to PSA levels at 6-months. Percent increase in α-tocopherol and trans-β-carotene levels from baseline to month 3 were associated with lower PSA levels at 3 and 6 months. Percent increase in β-cryptoxanthin, cis-lutein/zeaxanthin and all-trans-lycopene were associated with lower PSA levels at 6 months only.  Conclusions:   Certain plasma carotenoids and tocopherols were related inversely to PSA levels at various timepoints, suggesting that greater intake of foods containing these micronutrients might be beneficial to men with PSA-defined PrCA recurrence.""","""['Samuel O Antwi', 'Susan E Steck', 'Hongmei Zhang', 'Lareissa Stumm', 'Jiajia Zhang', 'Thomas G Hurley', 'James R Hebert']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Lower prostate cancer risk in men with elevated plasma lycopene levels: results of a prospective analysis.', 'Relationship between plasma carotenoids and prostate cancer.', 'Plasma Carotenoids, Tocopherols, and Retinol in the Age-Stratified (35-74 Years) General Population: A Cross-Sectional Study in Six European Countries.', 'Plasma fat-soluble vitamin and carotenoid concentrations after plant sterol and plant stanol consumption: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Prospective study of carotenoids, tocopherols, and retinoid concentrations and the risk of breast cancer.', 'Plasma Micronutrient Profile of Prostate Cancer Cases Is Altered Relative to Healthy Controls-Results of a Pilot Study in South Australia.', 'Anti-prostate cancer protection and therapy in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine - comprehensive effects of phytochemicals in primary, secondary and tertiary care.', 'Novel immune-related signature for risk stratification and prognosis in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Dietary Factors and Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Reduction.', 'Chili Pepper Carotenoids: Nutraceutical Properties and Mechanisms of Action.']"""

Combining ridaforolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, with MK-2206, an Akt inhibitor, may more completely block the PI3K pathway and inhibit tumor growth.  Experimental design:   This phase I study assessed dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of oral ridaforolimus plus oral MK-2206 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Efficacy was evaluated in patients with biomarker-identified estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (low RAS gene signature and high Ki67 index) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (PTEN deficiency) with PI3K pathway addiction.  Results:   Thirty-five patients were enrolled: 11 patients in part A (three breast cancer) and 24 biomarker-eligible patients in part B (16 breast cancer, eight prostate cancer). One patient with breast cancer from part A was also found to be biomarker-eligible when tested after she had clinical response. The MTD was 10 mg/d ridaforolimus 5 d/wk + 90 mg/wk MK-2206; 1 of 17 patients experienced DLT (grade 3 rash) at this dose. The most common adverse events at MTD were rash (44.4%), stomatitis (38.9%), diarrhea (27.8%), and decreased appetite (27.8%). By investigator assessment, 2 of 16 (12.5%) evaluable patients with breast cancer had partial response; by central assessment, 2 of 14 (14.3%) evaluable patients had complete response. Two patients had durable stable disease (SD) for 416 and 285 days, respectively. No patients with prostate cancer responded; one patient had SD for ≥ 6 months.

Nonetheless, representative survey data show that 35% of the European adult population is physically inactive. Inadequate levels of physical activity are disconcerting given substantial epidemiologic evidence showing that physical activity is associated with decreased risks of colon, endometrial, and breast cancers. For example, insufficient physical activity levels are thought to cause 9% of breast cancer cases and 10% of colon cancer cases in Europe. By comparison, the evidence for a beneficial effect of physical activity is less consistent for cancers of the lung, pancreas, ovary, prostate, kidney, and stomach. The biologic pathways underlying the association between physical activity and cancer risk are incompletely defined, but potential etiologic pathways include insulin resistance, growth factors, adipocytokines, steroid hormones, and immune function. In recent years, sedentary behavior has emerged as a potential independent determinant of cancer risk. In cancer survivors, physical activity has shown positive effects on body composition, physical fitness, quality of life, anxiety, and self-esteem. Physical activity may also carry benefits regarding cancer survival, but more evidence linking increased physical activity to prolonged cancer survival is needed. Future studies using new technologies - such as accelerometers and e-tools - will contribute to improved assessments of physical activity.

(18)F-FCH PET/CT showed a focus of linear increased uptake by a possible Meckel's diverticulum in the right hemi-pelvis, which was an incidental finding in this asymptomatic patient. Uptake of (18)F-FCH by Meckel's diverticulum has not been reported before and thus the mechanism of uptake has not been established. Two postulations may explain this uptake. First, since Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum containing all layers of the intestinal wall, the uptake may be related to physiological bowel-related uptake. Second, the uptake may be due to heterotopic pancreatic tissue in Meckel's diverticulum, especially since the intensity of uptake we have noticed was similar to that of physiological pancreatic uptake. As (18)F-FCH PET/CT scan is often used for evaluating prostate cancer, (18)F-FCH uptake by Meckel's diverticulum in the pelvis or lower abdomen may be mistaken for tumor involvement/recurrence. The identification by imaging of Meckel's diverticulum relies on the identification of a blind ending tubular structure, arising from the distal ileum. The identification of this structure may be best appreciated on the axial, coronal or sagittal plane.  Conclusion:   In this particular case, we managed to clearly demonstrate the presence of a tubular blind ending structure arising from the distal ileum on the sagittal images.

Combining classes of agents that target different components of AR signaling has the potential to delay resistance and improve patient outcomes. Many oncoproteins, including the AR, rely on the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) for functional maturation and stability. In this study, enhanced anti-proliferative activity of the Hsp90 inhibitors 17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and AUY922 in androgen-sensitive and CRPC cells was achieved when the agents were used in combination with AR antagonists bicalutamide or enzalutamide. Moreover, significant caspase-dependent cell death was achieved using sub-optimal agent doses that individually have no effect. Expression profiling demonstrated regulation of a broadened set of AR target genes with combined 17-AAG and bicalutamide compared with the respective single agent treatments. This enhanced inhibition of AR signaling was accompanied by impaired chromatin binding and nuclear localization of the AR. Importantly, expression of the AR variant AR-V7 that is implicated in resistance to AR antagonists was not induced by combination treatment. Likewise, the heat shock response that is typically elicited with therapeutic doses of Hsp90 inhibitors, and is a potential mediator of resistance to these agents, was significantly reduced by combination treatment. In summary, the co-targeting strategy in this study more effectively inhibits AR signaling than targeting AR or HSP90 alone and prevents induction of key resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer cells.

Hypoxia decreases androgen receptor (AR) protein levels. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that p62-mediated autophagy degrades AR protein and suppresses apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCaP cells in hypoxia. In LNCaP cells, hypoxia decreased AR at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. Hypoxia-induced AR degradation was inhibited not only by knockdown of LC3, a key component of the autophagy machinery, but also by knockdown of p62. Depletion of p62 enhanced hypoxia-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-3 cleavage, markers of apoptosis, whereas simultaneous knockdown of p62 and AR suppressed hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Hypoxia increased the formation of a cytosolic p62-AR complex and enhanced sequestration of AR from the nucleus. Formation of this complex was promoted by the increased phosphorylation of serine 403 in the ubiquitin-associated domain of p62 during hypoxia. An antioxidant and an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor reduced hypoxia-induced p62 phosphorylation at serine 403 and suppressed hypoxia-induced complex formation between AR and p62. These results demonstrate that hypoxia enhances the complex formation between p62 and AR by promoting phosphorylation of p62 at serine 403, probably through activating AMPK, and that p62-mediated autophagy degrades AR protein for cell survival in hypoxia.""","""['Takakazu Mitani', 'Masato Minami', 'Naoki Harada', 'Hitoshi Ashida', 'Ryoichi Yamaji']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Hypoxia-activated autophagy accelerates degradation of SQSTM1/p62.', 'RIPK3 regulates p62-LC3 complex formation via the caspase-8-dependent cleavage of p62.', 'Involvement of selective autophagy mediated by p62/SQSTM1\xa0in KLHL3-dependent WNK4 degradation.', 'Autophagic Regulation of p62 is Critical for Cancer Therapy.', 'Interaction domains of p62: a bridge between p62 and selective autophagy.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Couples 3βHSD1 Enzyme and Cofactor Upregulation to Facilitate Androgen Biosynthesis and Hormone Therapy Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Possible Mechanisms for Maintenance and Regression of Corpus Luteum Through the Ubiquitin-Proteasome and Autophagy System Regulated by Transcriptional Factors.', 'Riluzole induces AR degradation via endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting the turnover of oncoproteins as a new avenue for therapeutics development in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Since constructing a robust and interpretable classifier is challenging in a high dimensional feature space, dimensionality reduction (DR) is often implemented prior to classifier construction. However, when DR is performed it can be challenging to quantify the contribution of each of the original features to the final classification result. We have previously presented a method for scoring features based on their importance for classification on an embedding derived via principal components analysis (PCA). However, nonlinear DR involves the eigen-decomposition of a kernel matrix rather than the data itself, compounding the issue of classifier interpretability. In this paper we present feature importance in nonlinear embeddings (FINE), an extension of our PCA-based feature scoring method to kernel PCA (KPCA), as well as several NLDR algorithms that can be cast as variants of KPCA. FINE is applied to four digital pathology datasets to identify key QH features for predicting the risk of breast and prostate cancer recurrence. Measures of nuclear and glandular architecture and clusteredness were found to play an important role in predicting the likelihood of recurrence of both breast and prostate cancers. Compared to the t-test, Fisher score, and Gini index, FINE was able to identify a stable set of features that provide good classification accuracy on four publicly available datasets from the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge.""","""['Shoshana B Ginsburg', 'George Lee', 'Sahirzeeshan Ali', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Variable importance in nonlinear kernels (VINK): classification of digitized histopathology.', 'Exploring nonlinear feature space dimension reduction and data representation in breast Cadx with Laplacian eigenmaps and t-SNE.', 'Computer-aided prognosis: predicting patient and disease outcome via quantitative fusion of multi-scale, multi-modal data.', 'A framework for optimal kernel-based manifold embedding of medical image data.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Revealing the Roles of Part-of-Speech Taggers in Alzheimer Disease Detection: Scientific Discovery Using One-Intervention Causal Explanation.', 'Ten quick tips for computational analysis of medical images.', 'Deep Learning-Based Diagnosis Method of Emergency Colorectal Pathology.', 'Digital pathology and computational image analysis in nephropathology.', 'Artificial intelligence in digital pathology - new tools for diagnosis and precision oncology.']"""

More recently, immature colon carcinoma transcript 1 (ICT1) has been reported to be overexpressed in various kinds of cancer cells. However, the role of ICT1 in human prostate cancer has not yet been determined. The authors selected two ICT1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences to block its endogenous expression in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC-3. Decreased ICT1 expression by either specific shRNA significantly inhibited cell viability and proliferation. Moreover, compared to controls, ICT1-silenced cells were more inclined to redistribute in the G2/M phase, leading to cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometry and Annexin V-APC/7-AAD double staining confirmed that knockdown of ICT1 increased late apoptotic cells. Furthermore, they found that ICT1 knockdown restricting G2-M transition may be partly through suppression of CDK1 and Cyclin B1. Knockdown of ICT1 induced apoptosis through activation of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase 3, upregulation of Bax expression, and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression in DU145 cells. In conclusion, this study highlights the crucial role of ICT1 in promoting prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. The depletion of ICT1 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA or small molecular inhibitor may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhijun Wang', 'Danfeng Xu', 'Yi Gao', 'Yushan Liu', 'Jizhong Ren', 'Yacheng Yao', 'Lei Yin', 'Jie Chen', 'Sishun Gan', 'Xingang Cui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Retraction of: Immature Colon Carcinoma Transcript 1 Is Essential for Prostate Cancer Cell Viability and Proliferation (doi: 10.1089/cbr.2014.1728).', 'Knockdown of Immature Colon Carcinoma Transcript 1 Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Immature colon carcinoma transcript-1 promotes cell growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via facilitating cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance.', 'ICT1 knockdown inhibits breast cancer cell growth via induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Immature colon carcinoma transcript-1 promotes proliferation of gastric cancer cells.', 'Knockdown of immature colon carcinoma transcript\xa01 induces suppression of proliferation, S-phase arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells.', 'Retraction of: Lentivirus-Mediated Knockdown of Myosin VI Inhibits Cell Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cell (doi: 10.1089/cbr.2014.1759).', 'Retraction of: Ribosomal Protein S15A Augments Human Osteosarcoma Cell Proliferation In Vitro (doi: 10.1089/cbr.2014.1698).', 'Functional Diversity of Mitochondrial Peptidyl-tRNA Hydrolase ICT1 in Human Cells.', 'Knockdown of Immature Colon Carcinoma Transcript 1 Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.']"""

We tested the hypothesis that the stromal cells from PZ and transitional zone (TZ) have differential effects on the ability of tumorigenesis.  Methods:   Stromal cells isolated from the PZ and TZ of normal human prostates mixed with DU145 cells subcutaneously injected into athymic nude mice. The volume and weight of tumors was measured and analyzing the ability of purified DU145 cells isolated from the tumors to migrate and proliferate. The expression patterns of stem cell-specific genes of these DU145 cells were examined. The C-Kit inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, was administrated to confirm the effect of stromal cells on the tumorigenesis.  Results:   The volume and weight of tumors were significantly higher in mice transplanted with DU145 and stromal cells from PZ. In contrast, the data was significantly lower with DU145 and stromal cells from TZ than DU145 alone. The purified DU145 cells isolated from the tumors with DU145 and stromal cells in PZ had increased ability to migrate and proliferate, and had increased expression of C-Kit. These effects of the stromal cells in the PZ on DU145 cells could be blocked using imatinib mesylate.  Conclusions:   Human stromal cells in the PZ promote the in vivo tumorigenesis of DU145 through up-regulating C-Kit; in contrast, the stromal cells in the TZ inhibit it through down-regulating the expression of C-Kit.

It acts as a tumor suppressor gene in cutaneous melanoma, prostate cancer and gastric cancer. However, whether fibulin-1 also acts as a tumor suppressor gene in lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. We also determined the association of fibulin-1 expression with various clinical and pathological parameters, which would show its potential role in clinical prognosis.  Methods:   We investigated and followed up 140 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent lung resection without pre- and post-operative systemic chemotherapy at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from 2009 to 2013. Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of fibulin-1 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. We then analyzed the correlations between fibulin-1 expression and clinicopathological variables as well as the patients' overall survival rate.  Results:   Both western blot assay and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the level of fibulin-1 was downregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with that of normal lung tissues. Fibulin-1 expression significantly correlated with histological differentiation (P = 0.046), clinical stage (P< 0.01), lymph node status (P = 0.038) and expression of Ki-67 (P = 0.013). More importantly, multivariate analysis revealed that fibulin-1 was an independent prognostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma, and high expression of fibulin-1 was significantly associated with better prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.

PIA was not related to Gleason grade and clinical stage, however it was associated to an insignificant tumors increase, OR:3.08 (95%CI:1.09-8.7), P = 0.033. The information in RPS suggests that PIA is associated with less aggressive tumors and a higher probability of insignificant tumors.  Conclusions:   PIA is present in one third of PBs, HGPIN in one half of them, and no association exists between both lesions. Contrary to HGPIN, PIA finding is associated to lower risk of PCa detection.

This study aimed to describe the detailed trend of PCa incidence and mortality in Shanghai, China.  Material and methods:   Incidence and mortality data of PCa in urban Shanghai during 1973 and 2009 were collected by the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Age standardized rates (ASR) of incidence and mortality were calculated based on the 1966 world standard population. Join point regression analysis was used to describe the trends and to identify specific time points when significant changes in incidence and mortality occurred.  Results:   The PCa incidence in Shanghai increased ~sixfold from an ASR of 2.13/100,000 in 1973 to 12.96/100,000 in 2009, and its rank ascended from the 17th to the 4th most common cancer during the period. The PCa mortality in Shanghai increased threefold from an ASR of 1.61/100,000 in 1973 to 4.97/100,000 in 2009, and its rank ascended from the 17th to the 6th most deadly cancer during this period. More specifically, the ASR of incidence increased slightly before 1991, sharply during1991-2004, and slightly after 2004, with annual percent changes (APC) of 2.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.3%-4.3%), 13.2% (11.4%-15.0%), and 3.2% (-0.3%-6.8%), respectively. The mortality trend was stable before 1985 and increased slowly but steadily after 1985, with APC of -0.6% (-4.4%-3.3%) and 5.3% (4.7%-6.0%), respectively. The increasing incidence and mortality rates were primarily observed in men ≥ 70 years.

We herein establish a novel role for pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), an established effector of Warburg-like glycolytic behavior, in OXPHOS metabolism induced by CAFs. Indeed, CAFs promote PKM2 post-translational modifications, such as cysteine oxidation and Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, allowing nuclear migration of PKM2 and the formation of a trimeric complex with hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and the transcriptional repressor Differentially Expressed in Chondrocytes-1 (DEC1). DEC1 recruitment is mandatory for downregulating miR205 expression, thereby fostering EMT execution and metabolic switch toward OXPHOS. Furthermore, the analysis of a cohort of PCa patients reveals a significant positive correlation between PKM2 nuclear localization and cancer aggressiveness, thereby validating our in vitro observations. Crucially, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological targeting of PKM2 nuclear translocation using DASA-58, as well as metformin, impairs metastatic dissemination of PCa cells in SCID mice.

As is currently increasingly recognized, a variety of channel types are involved in cancer hallmarks, and regulate specific stages of neoplastic progression. Long-term in vitro work has established that inhibition of these ion channels impairs the growth of cancer cells. Recently, these studies have been followed up in vivo, hence revealing that ion channels constitute promising pharmacological targets in oncology. The channel proteins can be often accessed from the extracellular milieu, which allows use of lower drug doses and decrease untoward toxicity. However, because of the central physiological roles exerted by ion channels in excitable cells, other types of side effects may arise, the gravest of which is cardiac arrhythmia. A paradigmatic case is offered by Kv11.1 (hERG1) channels. HERG1 blockers attenuate the progression of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but may also lead to the lengthening of the electrocardiographic QT interval, thus predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias. These side effects can be avoided by specifically inhibiting the channel isoforms which are highly expressed in certain tumors, such as Kv11.1B and the neonatal forms of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Preclinical studies are also being explored in breast and prostate cancer (targeting voltage-gated Na(+) channels), and gliomas (targeting CLC-3). Overall, the possible approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) the development of specific inhibitors for the channel subtypes expressed in specific tumors; (2) drug delivery into the tumor by using antibodies or nanotechnology-based approaches; (3) combination regimen therapy and (4) blocking specific conformational states of the ion channel.

(18)F-fluoride is a bone-specific tracer whose uptake depends on osteoblastic activity. Because of the resulting increase in bone mineralization and sclerosis, the osteoblastic process can also be detected morphologically in CT images. Although CT is characterized by high resolution, the potential of PET is limited by its lower spatial resolution and the resulting partial-volume effect. In this context, the synergy between PET and CT presents an opportunity to resolve this limitation using a novel multimodal approach called synergistic functional-structural resolution recovery (SFS-RR). Its performance is benchmarked against current resolution recovery technology using the point-spread function (PSF) of the scanner in the reconstruction procedure.  Methods:   The SFS-RR technique takes advantage of the multiresolution property of the wavelet transform applied to both functional and structural images to create a high-resolution PET image that exploits the structural information of CT. Although the method was originally conceived for PET/MR imaging of brain data, an ad hoc version for whole-body PET/CT is proposed here. Three phantom experiments and 2 datasets of metastatic bone (18)F-fluoride PET/CT images from primary prostate and breast cancer were used to test the algorithm performances. The SFS-RR images were compared with the manufacturer's PSF-based reconstruction using the standardized uptake value (SUV) and the metabolic volume as metrics for quantification.  Results:   When compared with standard PET images, the phantom experiments showed a bias reduction of 14% in activity and 1.3 cm(3) in volume estimates for PSF images and up to 20% and 2.5 cm(3) for the SFS-RR images. The SFS-RR images were characterized by a higher recovery coefficient (up to 60%) whereas noise levels remained comparable to those of standard PET. The clinical data showed an increase in the SUV estimates for SFS-RR images up to 34% for peak SUV and 50% for maximum SUV and mean SUV. Images were also characterized by sharper lesion contours and better lesion detectability.  Conclusion:   The proposed methodology generates PET images with improved quantitative and qualitative properties. Compared with standard methods, SFS-RR provides superior lesion segmentation and quantification, which may result in more accurate tumor characterization.""","""['Elisabetta Grecchi', ""Jim O'Doherty"", 'Mattia Veronese', 'Charalampos Tsoumpas', 'Gary J Cook', 'Federico E Turkheimer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Performance measurement of PSF modeling reconstruction (True X) on Siemens Biograph TruePoint TrueV PET/CT.', 'Phantom and Clinical Evaluation of the Bayesian Penalized Likelihood Reconstruction Algorithm Q.Clear on an LYSO PET/CT System.', 'Characterization of the impact to PET quantification and image quality of an anterior array surface coil for PET/MR imaging.', 'A literature review of 18F-fluoride PET/CT and 18F-choline or 11C-choline PET/CT for detection of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Error propagation analysis of seven partial volume correction algorithms for 18FTHK-5351 brain PET imaging.', 'Optimization of a Bayesian penalized likelihood algorithm (Q.Clear) for 18F-NaF bone PET/CT images acquired over shorter durations using a custom-designed phantom.', 'Amyloid PET as a marker of normal-appearing white matter early damage in multiple sclerosis: correlation with CSF β-amyloid levels and brain volumes.', 'Multimodal partial volume correction: Application to 11CPIB PET/MRI myelin imaging in multiple sclerosis.', 'Partial volume correction for improved PET quantification in 18F-NaF imaging of atherosclerotic plaques.']"""

Methods:   Six patients received 2 intravenous injections of (223)Ra-dichloride, 6 wk apart, at 100 kBq/kg of whole-body weight. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution as a function of time were determined, and dosimetry was performed for a range of organs including bone surfaces, red marrow, kidneys, gut, and whole body using scintigraphic imaging; external counting; and blood, fecal, and urine collection. Safety was assessed from adverse events.  Results:   The injected activity cleared rapidly from blood, with 1.1% remaining at 24 h. The main route of excretion was via the gut, although no significant toxicity was reported. Most of the administered activity was taken up rapidly into bone (61% at 4 h). The range of absorbed doses delivered to the bone surfaces from α emissions was 2,331-13,118 mGy/MBq. The ranges of absorbed doses delivered to the red marrow were 177-994 and 1-5 mGy/MBq from activity on the bone surfaces and from activity in the blood, respectively. No activity-limiting toxicity was observed at these levels of administration. The absorbed doses from the second treatment were correlated significantly with the first for a combination of the whole body, bone surfaces, kidneys, and liver.  Conclusion:   A wide range of interpatient absorbed doses was delivered to normal organs. Intrapatient absorbed doses were significantly correlated between the 2 administrations for any given patient. The lack of gastrointestinal toxicity is likely due to the low absorbed doses delivered to the gut wall from the gut contents. The lack of adverse myelotoxicity implies that the absorbed dose delivered from the circulating activity may be a more relevant guide to the potential for marrow toxicity than that due to activity on the bone surfaces.""","""['Sarah J Chittenden', 'Cecilia Hindorf', 'Christopher C Parker', 'Valerie J Lewington', 'Brenda E Pratt', 'Bernadette Johnson', 'Glenn D Flux']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Pharmacokinetics of single dose radium-223 dichloride (BAY 88-8223) in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Phase I pharmacokinetic and biodistribution study with escalating doses of ²²³Ra-dichloride in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The potential of 223Ra and 18F-fluoride imaging to predict bone lesion response to treatment with 223Ra-dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'High-linear energy transfer irradiation targeted to skeletal metastases by the alpha-emitter 223Ra: adjuvant or alternative to conventional modalities?', 'Radium-223 treatment of bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radiation safety considerations for the use of radium-224-calciumcarbonate-microparticles in patients with peritoneal metastasis.', 'Comparing absorbed doses and radiation risk of the α-emitting bone-seekers 223RaRaCl2 and 224RaRaCl2.', 'Differential responses to 223Ra and Alpha-particles exposure in prostate cancer driven by mitotic catastrophe.', 'Joint EANM, SNMMI and IAEA enabling guide: how to set up a theranostics centre.', 'Personalized Dosimetry in Targeted Radiation Therapy: A Look to Methods, Tools and Critical Aspects.']"""

Desmopressin is a well-known synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. It has recently been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in in vivo models. Docetaxel is widely used for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. However, durable responses have been uncommon to date. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of desmopressin in combination with docetaxel in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Two prostate cancer cells (PC3, LNCaP) were treated with different concentrations of desmopressin alone, docetaxel alone, and a combination of desmopressin and docetaxel. Cell proliferation was determined by MTS assay. The anti-invasive and anti-migration potential of desmopressin and in combination with docetaxel were examined by wound healing assay, migration chamber assay, and matrigel invasion assay.  Results:   The combination of desmopressin and docetaxel resulted in a significant inhibition of PC3 and LNCaP cell proliferation (p < 0.01). Additionally, cell migration and invasion were also inhibited by the combination when compared to that of either treatment alone in PC3 cells (p < 0.01). The anti-tumor effect of this combination treatment was associated with down-regulation of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in PC3 cells.  Conclusions:   We are the first to elucidate the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic potential of desmopressin in combination with docetaxel in a prostate cancer model via the uPA-MMP pathway. Our finding could potentially contribute to the therapeutic profile of desmopressin and enhance the efficacy of docetaxel based treatment for CRPC.""","""['Hiroshi Sasaki', 'Laurence H Klotz', 'Linda M Sugar', 'Alexander Kiss', 'Vasundara Venkateswaran']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Combining Desmopressin and Docetaxel for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in an Orthotopic Model.', 'Antitumor and antimetastatic activities of docetaxel are enhanced by genistein through regulation of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand/MMP-9 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Rapamycin enhances docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in a androgen-independent prostate cancer xenograft model by survivin downregulation.', 'Insulin-like growth factor I and urokinase-type plasminogen activator bioregulation system as a survival mechanism of prostate cancer cells in osteoblastic metastases: development of anti-survival factor therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.', 'Exploiting Dependence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer on the Arginine Vasopressin Signaling Axis by Repurposing Vaptans.', 'Anticancer activity of repurposed hemostatic agent desmopressin on AVPR2-expressing human osteosarcoma.', 'Ricinus communis Butanol Fraction Inhibits MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cell Migration, Adhesion, and Invasiveness.', 'New drugs are not enough‑drug repositioning in oncology: An update.', 'Rosemary Extract Inhibits Proliferation, Survival, Akt, and mTOR Signaling in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

The degree of improvement by age, race, and sex remains unclear.  Objective:   To quantify the degree of survival improvement over time by age, race, and sex in the United States.  Design, setting, and participants:   Longitudinal analyses of cancer follow-up data from 1990 to 2010, from 1.02 million patients who had been diagnosed as having cancer of the colon or rectum, breast, prostate, lung, liver, pancreas, or ovary from 1990 to 2009 and who were included in 1 of 9 population-based registries of the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.  Main outcomes and measures:   Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for cancer-specific death were estimated for patients diagnosed as having any of these cancers during 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, and 2005 to 2009, compared with those diagnosed in 1990 to 1994.  Results:   Significant improvements in survival were found for cancers of the colon or rectum, breast, prostate, lung, and liver. Improvements were more pronounced for younger patients. For patients aged 50 to 64 years and diagnosed from 2005 to 2009, adjusted HRs (95% CIs) were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.55-0.60), 0.48 (95% CI, 0.45-0.51), 0.61 (95% CI, 0.57-0.69), and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30-0.36), for cancer of the colon or rectum, breast, liver, and prostate, respectively, compared with the same age groups of patients diagnosed during 1990 to 1994. However, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for elderly patients (those 75-85 years old) were only 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69-0.84), and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61-0.70), for the same 4 cancer sites, respectively. A similar, although weaker, age-related period effect was observed for lung and pancreatic cancers. The adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for lung cancer were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.86), respectively, for patients aged 50 to 64 years and 75 to 85 years diagnosed between 2005 and 2009, compared with the same age groups of patients diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 (0.73 [95% CI, 0.69-0.77] and 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85-0.95], respectively.

These men may experience considerable detriments of quality of life owing to sexual, urinary, and/or rectal toxic effects associated with these treatments. Without a better understanding of the mutable agents and predictors of treatment types, diffusion of expectant management among these men will be slow.  Objective:   To determine population-based predictors for treatment and use of watchful waiting or active surveillance for indolent prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data. A total of 37,621 men in the general community diagnosed as having prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 were followed until December 31, 2009.  Exposures:   Watchful waiting or active surveillance, radiation therapy, or radical prostatectomy.  Main outcomes and measures:   We used mixed-effects logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with aggressive treatment and use of watchful waiting or active surveillance for men with prostate cancer.  Results:   The most common treatment type is radiation therapy (57.9% [95% CI, 57.4%-58.4%]), followed by radical prostatectomy (19.1% [95% CI, 18.7%-19.5%]) and watchful waiting or active surveillance (9.6% [95% CI, 9.3%-9.9%]). Moreover, patients and providers significantly integrate age (odds ratio [OR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.29-0.35]) and comorbidities (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.56-0.68]) when determining radical prostatectomy, while regional variation (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47-0.68]) and referral patterns (OR, 44.46 [95% CI, 41.04-48.17]) influence the use of radiation therapy. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics significantly account for 40% of patients undergoing prostatectomy, 12% choosing watchful waiting or active surveillance, and only 3% undergoing radiotherapy.  Conclusions and relevance:   There is increased use of radiotherapy among patients with indolent prostate cancer with limited to no correlation with tumor biology. Active surveillance was underused, and a significant proportion of the variance was unexplained.

Our previous studies have proved that activation of P2Y2 receptor by extracellular ATP could promote prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo via regulating the expressions of some epithelial-mesenchymal transition/invasion-related genes (including IL-8, E-cadherin, Snail and Claudin-1), and the most significant change in expression of IL-8 was observed after P2Y2 receptor activation. However, the signaling pathway downstream of P2Y2 receptor and the role of IL-8 in P2Y2-mediated prostate cancer cell invasion remain unclear. Here, we found that extracellular ATP/UTP induced activation of EGFR and ERK1/2. After knockdown of P2Y2 receptor, the ATP -stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 was significantly suppressed. Further experiments showed that inactivation of EGFR and ERK1/2 attenuated ATP-induced invasion and migration, and suppressed ATP-mediated IL-8 production. In addition, knockdown of IL-8 inhibited ATP-mediated invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. These findings suggest that P2Y2 receptor and EGFR cooperate to upregulate IL-8 production via ERK1/2 pathway, thereby promoting prostate cancer cell invasion and migration.

These studies were mainly carried out in Western populations and little was known about associations in East Asians.  Objective:   To analyze the association between PD and risk of cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cohort study, the data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which contained information on approximately 24.7 million insured individuals. The cohort included individuals with newly diagnosed as having PD between 2004 and 2010. An age- and sex-matched systematic random-sampling method was used for subject selection in the reference non-PD cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the effects of PD on the risks of cancer, as shown by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.  Main outcomes and measures:   The Taiwan Population Census and National Cancer Registry Databases were used to identify patients with cancer. The last follow-up date was December 31, 2012.  Results:   In 62 023 patients with PD, the HR for all subsequent cancers combined was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.50-1.65). Of the 19 types of cancer, Parkinson disease was not associated with breast, ovarian, or thyroid cancers. Increased HRs were found in the remaining 16 cancers, including malignant brain tumors (HR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.84-6.38), gastrointestinal tract cancers (esophageal [HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28-2.57], stomach [HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94], colorectal [HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.31-1.65], liver [HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.67-2.14]; gallbladder [HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.16-2.57], and pancreas [HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.02]) (P < .05 for all comparisons), lung cancers (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.38-1.76), some hormone-related cancers (uterine [HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-3.01], cervical [HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.76], and prostate [HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.52-2.13; P < .05 for all comparisons), urinary tract cancers (kidney and bladder cancers; HRs, 1.59 and 1.99, respectively; P < .001 for both comparisons), lymphoma and/or leukemia (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.01), melanoma (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.35-5.59), and other skin cancers (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.46-2.23). For hepatocellular carcinoma, the highest HR resided in the 50- to 59-year-old group (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.7-3.89).

However, scarce evidence addresses whether dose escalation improves overall survival.  Objective:   To examine the association between dose-escalated EBRT and overall survival among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective, nonrandomized comparative effectiveness study of dose-escalated vs standard-dose EBRT for prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), which includes data from patients treated at Commission on Cancer-accredited community, academic, and comprehensive cancer facilities. Three cohorts were evaluated: men with low-risk (n = 12,229), intermediate-risk (n = 16,714), or high-risk (n = 13,538) prostate cancer.  Exposures:   We categorized patients in each risk cohort into 2 treatment groups: standard-dose (from 68.4 Gy to <75.6 Gy) or dose-escalated (≥75.6 Gy to 90 Gy) EBRT (1 Gy = 100 rad).  Main outcomes and measures:   We compared overall survival between treatment groups in each analytic cohort using Cox proportional hazard models with an inverse probability weighted propensity score (IPW-PS) approach. In secondary analyses, we evaluated dose response for survival.  Results:   Dose-escalated EBRT was associated with improved survival in the intermediate-risk (IPW-PS adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88; P < .001) and high-risk groups (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.85; P < .001) but not the low-risk group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.05; P = .54). For every incremental increase of about 2 Gy in dose, there was a 7.8% (95% CI, 5.4%-10.2%; P < .001) and 6.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-9.1%; P < .001) reduction in the hazard of death for intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively.  Conclusions and relevance:   Dose-escalated EBRT is associated with improved overall survival in men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer but not low-risk prostate cancer. These results add to the evidence questioning aggressive local treatment strategies in men with low-risk prostate cancer but supporting such treatment in men with greater disease severity.""","""['Anusha Kalbasi', 'Jiaqi Li', 'Abigail Berman', 'Samuel Swisher-McClure', 'Marc Smaldone', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Dylan S Small', 'Nandita Mitra', 'Justin E Bekelman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Dose-Escalated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Is the Sky the Limit?', 'Re: Dose-Escalated Irradiation and Overall Survival in Men with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival Outcomes of Dose-Escalated External Beam Radiotherapy versus Combined Brachytherapy for Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Using the National Cancer Data Base.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the effectiveness of adding androgen deprivation to modern dose-escalated radiotherapy for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Optimal treatment of intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma with radiotherapy: clinical and translational issues.', 'Radiotherapy planning in a prostate cancer phantom model with intraprostatic dominant lesions using stereotactic body radiotherapy with volumetric modulated arcs and a simultaneous integrated boost.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy for clinically localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeted Radiation and Immune Therapies-Advances and Opportunities for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life of salvage prostate reirradiation using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy with urethral-sparing.']"""

Preoperative serum levels of testosterone (T), free T, and SHBG level were prospectively analyzed in 307 consecutive patients who underwent RP at our institution between January 2006 and July 2007. We analyzed potential associations of sex hormones with postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival via multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis. Mean postoperative follow-up duration for 307 total patients was 72.1 ± 19.6 months. Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that BCR-free survival was significantly worse in patients with higher (≥ 40 ng/mL) SHBG level than others (P < 0.001). Serum T (P = 0.280) and free T (P = 0.606) levels showed no significant association with biochemical outcome. In multivariate analysis encompassing postoperative variables along with PSA, T, and free T, SHBG level (HR 1.825, 1.061-3.138; P = 0.030) was observed to be independently associated with BCR-free survival. Addition of SHBG level to the multivariate model for prediction of BCR-free survival resulted in increased accuracy (83.5% vs. 82.2%; P = 0.164).

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a precursor of testosterone and a substrate for SLCO2B1, an organic anionic transporter. We previously demonstrated that genetic variants of SLCO2B1 correlated with time to progression (TTP) during receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Statins also use SLCO2B1 to enter cells, and thus we hypothesized that they may compete with DHEAS uptake by the tumor cells.  Objective:   To evaluate whether statin use prolongs TTP during ADT for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   In vitro studies were performed using prostate cancer cell lines at an academic, comprehensive cancer center. Statin use was retrospectively analyzed in 926 patients who had received ADT for biochemical or metastatic recurrence or de novo metastatic prostate cancer between January 1996 and November 2013.  Main outcomes and measures:   To determine whether statins interfere with DHEAS uptake, we performed in vitro studies using prostate cancer cell lines. Next, we queried our institutional clinical database to assess for an association between statin use and TTP during ADT using multivariable Cox regression analysis and adjusted for known prognostic factors.  Results:   In vitro, we demonstrated that statins block DHEAS uptake by competitively binding to SLCO2B1. In our ADT cohort of 926 patients, 283 (31%) were taking a statin at ADT initiation. After a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 644 patients (70%) had experienced disease progression while receiving ADT. Median TTP during ADT was 20.3 months (95% CI, 18-24 months). Men taking statins had a longer median TTP during ADT compared with nonusers (27.5 [95% CI, 21.1-37.7] vs 17.4 [95% CI, 14.9-21.1] months; P < .001). The association remained statistically significant after adjusting for predefined prognostic factors (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]; P = .04). The positive statin effect was observed for both patients with and without metastases (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.58-1.07] for M0 disease and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.67-1.06] for M1 disease; P for interaction = .72).  Conclusions and relevance:   Statin use at the time of ADT initiation was associated with a significantly longer TTP during ADT even after adjustment for known prognostic factors. Our in vitro finding that statins competitively reduce DHEAS uptake, thus effectively decreasing the available intratumoral androgen pool, affords a plausible mechanism to support the clinical observation of prolonged TTP in statin users.""","""['Lauren C Harshman', 'Xiaodong Wang', 'Mari Nakabayashi', 'Wanling Xie', 'Loana Valenca', 'Lillian Werner', 'Yongjiang Yu', 'Aaron M Kantoff', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Mark Pomerantz', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Incorrect Units in Methods.

We describe a whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused on patients with advanced cancer.  Objective:   To understand how WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response.  Design, setting, and patients:   Patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information with clinical response.  Main outcomes and measures:   Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and identification of novel biomarkers.  Results:   A total of 154 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95X and 16 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided informative results in 91 cases (94%), including alterations for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however, treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5%) on the basis of these recommendations because of access to clinical trials and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial loss of function of the second allele through germline missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss of FANCA function was associated with platinum hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional evidence for his extreme clinical response.

Objective:   To investigate whether AR-V7-positive patients would retain sensitivity to taxane chemotherapy and whether AR-V7 status would have a differential impact on taxane-treated men compared with enzalutamide- or abiraterone-treated men.  Design, setting, and participants:   We examined CTCs for AR-V7 mRNA using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. From January 2013 to July 2014, we prospectively enrolled patients with metastatic CRPC initiating taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) at a single academic institution (Johns Hopkins). Our prespecified statistical plan required a sample size of 36 taxane-treated men.  Main outcomes and measures:   We evaluated associations between AR-V7 status and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates, PSA progression-free survival (PSA PFS), and clinical and/or radiographic progression-free survival (PFS). After incorporating updated data from our prior study of 62 patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone, we also investigated the interaction between AR-V7 status (positive or negative) and treatment type (taxane vs enzalutamide or abiraterone).  Results:   Of 37 taxane-treated patients enrolled, 17 (46%) had detectable AR-V7 in CTCs. Prostate-specific antigen responses were achieved in both AR-V7-positive and AR-V7-negative men (41% vs 65%; P = .19). Similarly, PSA PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7, 95% CI, 0.6-5.0; P = .32) and PFS (HR, 2.7, 95% CI, 0.8-8.8; P = .11) were comparable in AR-V7-positive and AR-V7-negative patients. A significant interaction was observed between AR-V7 status and treatment type (P < .001). Clinical outcomes were superior with taxanes compared with enzalutamide or abiraterone therapy in AR-V7-positive men, whereas outcomes did not differ by treatment type in AR-V7-negative men. In AR-V7-positive patients, PSA responses were higher in taxane-treated vs enzalutamide- or abiraterone-treated men (41% vs 0%; P < .001), and PSA PFS and PFS were significantly longer in taxane-treated men (HR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.07-0.52] for PSA PFS, P = .001; HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.59] for PFS, P = .003).  Conclusions and relevance:   Detection of AR-V7 in CTCs from men with metastatic CRPC is not associated with primary resistance to taxane chemotherapy. In AR-V7-positive men, taxanes appear to be more efficacious than enzalutamide or abiraterone therapy, whereas in AR-V7-negative men, taxanes and enzalutamide or abiraterone may have comparable efficacy.

Many essential proteins for cell death, growth, differentiation, and development, such as Ras, require prenylation for subcellular localization and activation. Prenylation of a protein is defined as the attachment of isoprenoids to a cysteine residue at or near the C-terminus. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) produces isoprenoids, and is posttranslationally regulated by oxygen. We investigated a critical role of intracellular oxygen in membrane localization of prenylated proteins. Localization of prenylated proteins (H-Ras, prelamin A/C, and Rab5a) was observed in poorly differentiated PCa (PC-3) and well-differentiated PCa (LNCaP) cells. PC-3 cells exhibited high intracellular oxygen concentration, and H-Ras, prelamin A/C, and Rab5a were localized to various membranes (Golgi and plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and early endosomes, respectively). Remarkably, exogenous hypoxia (0.2% O2) in PC-3 cells induced intracellular hypoxia and changed the localization of the prenylated proteins. H-Ras and Rab5a were translocated to cytosol, and prelamin A/C was in the nucleus forming an abnormal nuclear envelope. The localization was reversed by mevalonate indicating the involvement of mevalonate pathway. In contrast, in LNCaP cells, exhibiting low intracellular oxygen concentration, H-Ras and Rab5a were localized in the cytosol, and prelamin A/C was inside the nucleus forming an inadequate nuclear envelope. Exogenous hyperoxia (40% O2) increased the intracellular oxygen concentration and induced Ras translocation from cytosol to the membrane. Prelamin A/C was translocated to the nuclear membrane and formed a proper nuclear envelope. Rab5a was translocated to the early endosomes. The specific localizations of the prenylated proteins were dependent on intracellular oxygen concentration. These results demonstrate that intracellular oxygen concentration regulates the localization and activation of prenylated proteins.""","""['A Kim', 'R Davis', 'M Higuchi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Consumption of oxygen: a mitochondrial-generated progression signal of advanced cancer.', 'Lycopene induces cell growth inhibition by altering mevalonate pathway and Ras signaling in cancer cell lines.', 'Dynamics of rab5 activation in endocytosis and phagocytosis.', 'Isoprenoids and Ras: potential role in chronic rejection.', 'Protein prenylation: molecular mechanisms and functional consequences.', 'Cysteine-based regulation of redox-sensitive Ras small GTPases.', 'Intracellular Oxygen Concentration Determined By Mitochondrial Respiration Regulates Production of Reactive Oxygen Species.', 'Subcellular Distribution of S-Nitrosylated H-Ras in Differentiated and Undifferentiated PC12 Cells during Hypoxia.', 'Sphingolipid accumulation causes mitochondrial dysregulation and cell death.']"""

Understanding underlying reasons for this disparity could identify preventive interventions important to African American men.  Objective:   To determine whether the association of obesity with prostate cancer risk differs between African American and non-Hispanic white men and whether obesity modifies the excess risk associated with African American race.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective study of 3398 African American and 22,673 non-Hispanic white men who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (2001-2011) with present analyses completed in 2014.  Main outcomes and measures:   Total, low-grade (Gleason score <7), and high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) prostate cancer incidence.  Results:   With a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.6 (1.8) years, there were 270, 148, and 88 cases of total, low-, and high-grade prostate cancers among African American men and a corresponding 1453, 898, and 441 cases in non-Hispanic white men, respectively. Although not associated with risk among non-Hispanic white men, BMI was positively associated with an increase in risk among African American men (BMI, <25 vs ≥35: hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 0.95, 2.34]; P for trend = .03). Consequently, the risk associated with African American race increased from 28% (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.91-1.80]) among men with BMI less than 25 to 103% (HR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.38-2.98]) among African American men with BMI at least 35 (P for trend = .03). Body mass index was inversely associated with low-grade prostate cancer risk within non-Hispanic white men (BMI, <25 vs ≥35: HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.58-1.09]; P for trend = .02) but positively associated with risk within African American men (BMI, <25 vs ≥35: HR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.17-4.21]; P for trend = .05). Body mass index was positively associated with risk of high-grade prostate cancer in both non-Hispanic white men (BMI, <25 vs ≥35: HR, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.90-1.97]; P for trend = .01) and African American men, although the increase may be larger within African American men, albeit the racial interaction was not statistically significant (BMI, <25 vs ≥35: HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 0.79-4.11]; P for trend = .02).  Conclusions and relevance:   Obesity is more strongly associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American than non-Hispanic white men and reducing obesity among African American men could reduce the racial disparity in cancer incidence.

However, given the grade migration following the 2005 International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference, AS may be appropriate for men presenting with favorable intermediate-risk PC.  Objective:   To estimate and compare the risk of PC-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) following brachytherapy among men with low and favorable intermediate-risk PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective cohort study of 5580 consecutively treated men (median age, 68 years) with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with brachytherapy at the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Chicago between October 16, 1997, and May 28, 2013.  Intervention:   Standard of practice per the NCCN guidelines.  Main outcomes and measures:   Fine and Gray competing risks regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess whether the risks of PCSM and ACM, respectively, were increased in men with favorable intermediate-risk vs low-risk PC. Analyses were adjusted for age at brachytherapy, year of treatment, and known PC prognostic factors.  Results:   After median follow-up of 7.69 years, 605 men had died (10.84% of total cohort), 34 of PC (5.62% of total deaths). Men with favorable intermediate-risk PC did not have significantly increased risk of PCSM and ACM compared with men with low-risk PC (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% CI, 0.76-3.53; P = .21 for PCSM; adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88-1.39; P = .38 for ACM). Eight-year adjusted point estimates for PCSM were low: 0.48% (95% CI, 0.23%-0.93%) and 0.33% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.56%) for men with favorable intermediate-risk PC and low-risk PC, respectively. The respective estimates for ACM were 10.45% (95% CI, 8.91%-12.12%) and 8.68% (95% CI, 7.80%-9.61%).  Conclusions and relevance:   Men with low-risk PC and favorable intermediate-risk PC have similarly low estimates of PCSM and ACM during the first decade following brachytherapy.

However, randomized clinical trials have raised concerns that their use may be associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer tumors that would ultimately lead to worse prostate cancer outcomes. To date, few observational studies have addressed this important safety concern.  Objective:   To determine whether the use of 5-ARIs before prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in men with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer in the real-world setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a cohort of 13,892 men with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2009, who were followed up until October 1, 2012. Patients were individually linked across 4 databases from the United Kingdom: National Cancer Data Repository, Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episodes Statistics database, and Office for National Statistics database.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality associated with prediagnostic use of 5-ARIs. For each outcome, 2 models were constructed, one adjusted for predefined covariates (conventional model) and another adjusted for high-dimensional propensity score (HD-PS) deciles.  Results:   During a mean (SD) of 4.5 (3.1) years, 5001 deaths occurred, including 2429 from prostate cancer (crude incidence rate of 3.86 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 3.71-4.02]). In the conventional model, use of 5-ARIs before prostate cancer diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (crude incidence rates, 3.76 [95% CI, 3.04-4.59] [use] vs 3.87 [95% CI, 3.71-4.03] [nonuse] per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.69-1.06]) and all-cause mortality (crude incidence rates, 8.42 [95% CI, 7.32-9.64] [use] vs 7.93 [95% CI, 7.71-8.16] [nonuse] per 100 person-years; aHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.00).

Objective:   To assess the association between midlife CRF and incident cancer and survival following a cancer diagnosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, observational cohort study conducted at a preventive medicine clinic. The study included 13 949 community-dwelling men who had a baseline fitness examination. All men completed a comprehensive medical examination, a cardiovascular risk factor assessment, and incremental treadmill exercise test to evaluate CRF. We used age- and sex-specific distribution of treadmill duration from the overall Cooper Center Longitudinal Study population to define fitness groups as those with low (lowest 20%), moderate (middle 40%), and high (upper 40%) CRF groups. The adjusted multivariable model included age, examination year, body mass index, smoking, total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and fasting glucose level. Cardiorespiratory fitness levels were assessed between 1971 and 2009, and incident lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer using Medicare Parts A and B claims data from 1999 to 2009; the analysis was conducted in 2014.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcomes were (1) incident prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer and (2) all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality among men who developed cancer at Medicare age (≥65 years).  Results:   Compared with men with low CRF, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers among men with high CRF were 0.45 (95% CI, 0.29-0.68), 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36-0.87), and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02-1.46), respectively. Among those diagnosed as having cancer at Medicare age, high CRF in midlife was associated with an adjusted 32% (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98) risk reduction in all cancer-related deaths and a 68% reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality following a cancer diagnosis (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.64) compared with men with low CRF in midlife.

Objective:   To determine whether regional rates of inappropriate prostate and breast cancer imaging were associated.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective cohort study using the the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. We identified patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2007 with low-risk prostate (clinical stage T1c/T2a; Gleason score, ≤6; and prostate-specific antigen level, <10 ng/mL) or breast cancer (in situ, stage I, or stage II disease), based on Choosing Wisely definitions.  Main outcomes and measures:   In a hospital referral region (HRR)-level analysis, our dependent variable was HRR-level imaging rate among patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Our independent variable was HRR-level imaging rate among patients with low-risk breast cancer. In a subsequent patient-level analysis we used multivariable logistic regression to model prostate cancer imaging as a function of regional breast cancer imaging and vice versa.  Results:   We identified 9219 men with prostate cancer and 30,398 women with breast cancer residing in 84 HRRs. We found high rates of inappropriate imaging for both prostate cancer (44.4%) and breast cancer (41.8%). In the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of breast cancer imaging, inappropriate prostate cancer imaging was 34.2%, 44.6%, 41.1%, and 56.4%, respectively. In the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of prostate cancer imaging, inappropriate breast cancer imaging was 38.1%, 38.4%, 43.8%, and 45.7%, respectively. At the HRR level, inappropriate prostate cancer imaging rates were associated with inappropriate breast cancer imaging rates (ρ = 0.35; P < .01). At the patient level, a man with low-risk prostate cancer had odds ratios (95% CIs) of 1.72 (1.12-2.65), 1.19 (0.78-1.81), or 1.76 (1.15-2.70) for undergoing inappropriate prostate imaging if he lived in an HRR in the fourth, third, or second quartiles, respectively, of inappropriate breast cancer imaging, compared with the lowest quartile.  Conclusions and relevance:   At a regional level, there is an association between inappropriate prostate and breast cancer imaging rates.

This effect was not significantly reduced in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Rhodamine 123 efflux assay showed that phentolamine was not a P-gp substrate. Phentolamine induced mitotic arrest of the cell cycle and formation of hyperdiploid cells, followed by an increase of apoptosis. Mitotic arrest was confirmed by cyclin B1 up-regulation, Cdk1 activation, and a dramatic increase of mitotic protein phosphorylation. Both in vitro and cellular identification demonstrated that phentolamine, similar to paclitaxel, induced tubulin polymerization and formation of multiple nuclei. Besides, it did not compete with paclitaxel binding on tubulin. Phentolamine induced the phosphorylation and degradation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and the loss of ΔΨm indicating the induction of mitochondrial damage. It ultimately induced the activation of caspase-9, -8, and -3 and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, combination treatment with phentolamine and paclitaxel caused a synergistic apoptosis.  Conclusions:   The data suggest that phentolamine is a potential anticancer agent. In contrast to a wide variety of microtubule disrupting agents, phentolamine induces microtubule assembly, leading to mitotic arrest of the cell cycle which ""in turn"" induces subsequent mitochondrial damage and activation of related apoptotic signaling pathways in CRPC cells. Furthermore, combination between phentolamine and paclitaxel induces a synergistic apoptotic cell death. Phentolamine has a simple chemical structure and is not a P-gp substrate. Optimization of phentolamine structure may also be a potential approach for further development.""","""['Chen-Hsun Ho', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Shih-Ping Liu', 'Lih-Ching Hsu', 'Wei-Ling Chang', 'Chuck C-K Chao', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Investigation of anti-tumor mechanisms of K2154: characterization of tubulin isotypes, mitotic arrest and apoptotic machinery.', 'Quinolone analogue inhibits tubulin polymerization and induces apoptosis via Cdk1-involved signaling pathways.', 'Zerumbone, a ginger sesquiterpene, induces apoptosis and autophagy in human hormone-refractory prostate cancers through tubulin binding and crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial insult.', 'Microtubule-targeted anticancer agents and apoptosis.', 'Microtubules in apoptosis induction: are they necessary?', 'Cell metabolomics analyses revealed a role of altered fatty acid oxidation in neurotoxicity pattern difference between nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based paclitaxel.', 'Differences in Fatty Acid Oxidation between Nab-Paclitaxel- and Solvent-Based Paclitaxel-Treated A549 Cells Based on Metabolomics.', 'Screening of Drug Repositioning Candidates for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Renal Drug Transporters and Drug Interactions.', 'Resveratrol induces mitochondria-mediated, caspase-independent apoptosis in murine prostate cancer cells.']"""

The objective was to compare the inter-practice and inter-regional variability in total and free PSA (tPSA and fPSA) requests by General Practitioners (GPs).  Methods:   76 laboratories covering a population of 17,679,195 inhabitants filled out the number of tPSA and fPSA requested by GPs during the year 2012. Test requests per 1,000 inhabitants and fPSA/tPSA request ratio were calculated. These variables were compared for the different hospitals according to their setting (urban, urban-rural or rural, location), and type of management (public/private). The tPSA requests necessary to comply with the recent guidelines from the European Association of Urology were calculated according to Spanish demographic characteristics in two possible scenarios depending on tPSA request: 2-4 years and 8 years interval.  Results:   tPSA/1,000 inhabitants ranged from 8.2 to 92.7. It was significantly higher in rural areas and varied significantly among the different geographical areas. fPSA/1,000 inhabitants was higher in hospitals with private management. A total of 1,755,712 additional tPSA tests would have been necessary to follow guidelines in the first scenario and 112,129 in the second.

We reviewed the following data: Surgeon, date of intervention, patient age, PSA, rectal digital examination (DRE), ultrasound, prostate volume, number of cores obtained, pathology result of the biopsy. The surgeons were residents in Urology in their first year in the department. For statistical analysis the biopsies were grouped in blocks of 25 and 75 cases performed by a surgeon, in a chronological order. To evaluate the influence of the learning curve on diagnosis we performed univariate and multivariate analysis between the different variables and pathological report.  Results:   Median age was 67 years (42-90). 300 biopsies (38%) were positive for prostate cancer. On univariate analysis, regarding cancer detection rate, the variables surgeon, PSA, DRE, ultrasound result, prostate volume, number of cores and groups of 75 showed statistically significant differences, this latter showing 32% in the first 75 biopsies and 43.2% in the last group.

DIAPH3 interacted with microtubules (MT), and its loss altered several parameters of MT dynamics as well as decreased polarized force generation, contractility, and response to substrate stiffness. Silencing of DIAPH3 increased the cytotoxic response to taxanes in prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of drug activity for tubulin-targeted agents in the NCI-60 cell line panel revealed a uniform positive correlation between reduced DIAPH3 expression and drug sensitivity. Low DIAPH3 expression correlated with improved relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic regimens containing taxanes.

Methods:   A data query for cases of UM seen at the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre between January 1993 and May 2014 was performed. Only patients who had UM with other non-ocular primary malignancies were included. Demographic and clinical data were analysed.  Results:   A total of 5042 (2563 males, 50.8%) patients with UM were found in the database; of whom, 216 (4.3%) had at least one other primary non-ocular malignancy. Of these 216 patients, 119 were males (55.1%). Forty five males (37.8%) had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, 30 (25.2%) with unspecified skin cancers, 15 (12.6%) with colon and bowel carcinoma, eight (6.7%) with systemic lymphoma and the remaining patients with less common tumours. Of the 97 females, 45 (46.4%) had been diagnosed with breast carcinoma, 19 (19.6%) had unspecified skin cancers, seven (7.2%) renal cell carcinoma, six (6.2%) colon and bowel carcinoma, and the remaining patients had other less common tumour types. In this cohort, the frequency of the most common additional malignancy in male and female patients with UM was comparable with their prevalence in the general UK population.

Thus, this study tested the combination of mTOR inhibition (everolimus) and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition (gefitinib) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   In phase 1, 12 patients (10 with CRPC and 2 with glioblastoma) received daily gefitinib (250 mg) with weekly everolimus (30, 50, or 70 mg). In phase 2, 27 CRPC patients received gefitinib with everolimus (70 mg).  Results:   Phase 1 revealed no pharmacokinetic interactions and no dose-limiting toxicities. In phase 2, 18 of 27 patients (67%) discontinued treatment before the 12-week evaluation because of progression as evidenced by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (n = 6) or imaging (n = 5) or because of a grade 2 or higher toxicity (n = 7). Thirteen of the 37 CRPC patients (35%) exhibited a rapidly rising PSA level after they had begun treatment, and this declined upon discontinuation. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 24 to 72 hours after the initiation of treatment showed a decrease in the standardized uptake value consistent with mTOR inhibition in 27 of the 33 evaluable patients (82%); there was a corresponding rise in PSA in 20 of these 27 patients (74%).  Conclusions:   The combination of gefitinib and everolimus did not result in significant antitumor activity. The induction of PSA in tumors treated with mTOR inhibitors was consistent with preclinical data showing that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway signaling feedback inhibits the androgen receptor (AR).

Favorable pathology was defined as Gleason score ≤6 and organ-confined cancer as detected by surgical pathology. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictive variables of favorable pathology, and the Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression model were used to estimate BCR-free survival after RARP. Overall, 38 patients (18.7%) had favorable pathology after RARP. Lower quartile prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) was associated with favorable pathology compared to the highest quartile PSAD after adjusting for preoperative PSA, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score (odds ratio, 5.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-28.97; P = 0.048).

There were significant differences with regard to BCR free survival by PSAD quartiles (log rank, P = 0.003). Using a multivariable Cox proportion hazard model, PSAD was found to be an independent predictor of BCR in patients with IRPCa after RARP (hazard ratio, 4.641; 95% confidence interval, 1.109-19.417; P = 0.036).

Methods:   Men who had completed active anti-cancer treatment for TC between 6 months and 5 years previously showing no evidence of recurrence were recruited from 14 Australian cancer centers from September 2009 to February 2011. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire measuring demographic, disease, and treatment information, psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress; DASS21), generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL; SF-36v2), TC-specific HRQOL (EORTC QLQ-TC26), coping (MAC), social support (DUFSS), and unmet needs (CaSUN).  Results:   Of 486 eligible TC survivors, 244 (50.2%) completed the questionnaire. Compared with normative data, TC survivors reported: small but statistically significant increases in mean levels of anxiety and depression; a greater prevalence of moderate to extremely severe anxiety (19%) and depression (20%); and significant deficits to mostly mental aspects of generic HRQOL. The most problematic TC-specific HRQOL issues (e.g., fear of recurrence) were also more mental than physical. In multiple regression analyses, the strongest correlates of psychological distress and impaired generic HRQOL were psychosocial (e.g., helpless/hopeless coping and lower social support) rather than disease or treatment factors.  Conclusions:   Generally, TC survivors appear to experience mild psychological distress and HRQOL impairments, while a vulnerable subgroup experience more severe morbidity.  Implications for cancer survivors:   There is a need to identify TC survivors at risk of poorer outcomes and for interventions to target the areas of greatest impairment (i.e., psychological distress and mental HRQOL).""","""['Allan Ben Smith', 'Phyllis Butow', 'Ian Olver', 'Tim Luckett', 'Peter Grimison', 'Guy C Toner', 'Martin R Stockler', 'Elizabeth Hovey', 'John Stubbs', 'Sandra Turner', 'George Hruby', 'Howard Gurney', 'Mahmood Alam', 'Keith Cox', 'Madeleine T King']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['The prevalence and correlates of supportive care needs in testicular cancer survivors: a cross-sectional study.', 'A systematic review of quantitative observational studies investigating psychological distress in testicular cancer survivors.', 'Health-related quality of life and psychological distress among cancer survivors in Southeast Asia: results from a longitudinal study in eight low- and middle-income countries.', 'An Updated Systematic Review of Quantitative Studies Assessing Anxiety, Depression, Fear of Cancer Recurrence or Psychological Distress in Testicular Cancer Survivors.', 'A literature review of the social and psychological needs of ovarian cancer survivors.', 'Unmet Supportive Care Needs after Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Resection at a Tertiary Hospital in Seoul, South Korea.', 'Changes in male sexuality after urologic cancer: a narrative review.', 'Psychological Distress in Patients Treated for Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Testicular cancer survivorship: Long-term toxicity and management.', 'The impact of testicular cancer and its treatment on masculinity: A systematic review.']"""

Recent studies demonstrated that Testicular orphan nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) could play a critical role in anti-oxidative stress responses and might modulate the DNA damage repair. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of TR4 in the radiotherapy for PCa.  Methods:   The TR4 expression in tissue samples from PCa patients treated with brachytherapy was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell survival test and colony formation assay were applied to test the radio-sensitivity of PCa cells with modulated TR4 gene expression upon irradiation.  Results:   PCa patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after brachytherapy tend to have higher TR4 expression (80%, n = 30) as compared to those without BCR (36.67%, n = 30). Survival analysis demonstrated a significant higher BCR occurrence in patients with high level of TR4 expression (HR = 3.474, 95%CI 1.678-7.192, P = 0.0008). Multivariate analysis showed that the TR4 staining score on IHC was the only significant variable for predicting the PCa patients' clinical outcomes after radiotherapy (OR = 9.919, 95% CI 2.516-39.101, P = 0.001). Using cell survival test and colony forming assay, we found that the addition of functional TR4 in PC3 cells lead to elevated radio-resistance. In contrast, knocking-down TR4 in LNCaP cells resulted in increased radio-sensitivity. The γH2AX foci kinetic analysis suggested that knocking down TR4 might delay the PCa cell's DNA damage repair which would enhance the radio-sensitivity.  Conclusion:   TR4 could mediate the PCa cells' radio-sensitivity and might become a prognostic indicator for PCa patients received radiotherapy. This study provides a novel approach to manipulate radio-sensitivity of PCa cells, and may bring a promoted therapeutic outcome of radiotherapy to battle PCa in future.""","""['Shicheng Yu', 'Mingchao Wang', 'Xianfan Ding', 'Liqun Xia', 'Bide Chen', 'Yicheng Chen', 'Zhigen Zhang', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Gonghui Li', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Increased chemosensitivity via targeting testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4)-Oct4-interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) axis in prostate cancer CD133+ stem/progenitor cells to battle prostate cancer.', 'Differential roles of PPARγ vs TR4 in prostate cancer and metabolic diseases.', 'TR4 nuclear receptor promotes prostate cancer metastasis via upregulation of CCL2/CCR2 signaling.', 'TR4 nuclear receptor functions as a tumor suppressor for prostate tumorigenesis via modulation of DNA damage/repair system.', 'TR4 Nuclear Receptor Different Roles in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The Influence of Anti-Diabetic Drugs on Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of miR‑145 and testicular nuclear receptor 4 inhibition to reduce chemoresistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Small-Molecule Regulators of Testicular Receptor 4 via a Drug Repurposing Screening.', 'Atorvastatin Enhances Effects of Radiotherapy on Prostate Cancer Cells and Xenograft Tumor Mice Through Triggering Interaction Between Bcl-2 and MSH2.', 'Targeting the TR4 nuclear receptor-mediated lncTASR/AXL signaling with tretinoin increases the sunitinib sensitivity to better suppress the RCC progression.']"""

PTEN gene deletion and ERG gene rearrangement are among the most common genomic changes in acinar prostate cancers. Though ductal adenocarcinoma most commonly occurs with synchronous usual-type acinar adenocarcinoma, little is known about the molecular phenotype of these mixed tumors.  Methods:   We used genetically validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays to assess PTEN and ERG status in a group of 37 surgically treated ductal adenocarcinomas and 18 synchronous acinar adenocarcinomas where we have previously reported ERG gene rearrangement status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A group of 34 stage and grade-matched pure acinar adenocarcinoma cases was studied as a control.  Results:   ERG IHC was highly concordant with ERG FISH results, with 100% (36/36) concordance among ductal adenocarcinomas and 91% (31/34) concordance among 34 pure acinar carcinomas. Similar to previous FISH results, ERG expression by IHC was significantly less common among ductal adenocarcinomas (11% or 4/37) and their synchronous acinar tumors (6% or 1/18) compared to matched pure acinar adenocarcinoma cases (50% or 17/34; P = 0.0005 and 0.002, respectively). PTEN loss by IHC was also less common among ductal adenocarcinomas (18% or 6/34) and their synchronous acinar tumors (22% or 4/18) compared to matched pure acinar carcinomas (50% or 17/34; P = 0.01 and 0.08, respectively). As expected, PTEN loss was enriched among ERG positive compared to ERG-negative tumors in the pure acinar tumor control group (2.5-fold enrichment; P = 0.04) however this was not observed among the ductal adenocarcinomas (1.5 fold enrichment; P = NS). Of ductal adenocarcinomas with an evaluable synchronous acinar component, ERG status was concordant in 94% (17/18) and PTEN status was concordant in 94% (16/17).

We aimed at developing a model for the identification of pathologically favorable PCa at radical prostatectomy (RP) among intermediate-risk patients.  Methods:   Overall, 3,821 intermediate-risk patients treated with RP at two centers between 2005 and 2013 were identified. Pathologically favorable PCa was defined as low-grade organ-confined disease. Age, biopsy Gleason, PSA density (PSAD), and the percentage of positive cores were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting favorable PCa and formed the basis for a logistic regression-based risk calculator. The internally validated discrimination and calibration of the risk calculator were quantified using 200 bootstrap resamples. Decision curve analysis (DCA) provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained using this model versus treating no one and treating everyone.  Results:   Overall, 10.0% of all intermediate risk patients had favorable disease. In multivariable analyses, patients with biopsy Gleason score ≤6 had higher probability of favorable disease compared to those with higher-grade disease (P < 0.001). Similarly, age, PSAD, and percentage of positive cores were associated with the probability of favorable disease (all P ≤ 0.01). The risk calculator achieved a validated accuracy of 82.5%. The DCA showed that our prediction model is better than both treating no one and treating everyone.  Conclusions:   One out of ten intermediate-risk patients harbors favorable disease at RP.

Methods:   A total of 25 patients were randomly assigned to the no balloon previous transurethral resection of the prostate laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group (n = 12) and the with balloon previous transurethral resection of the prostate laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group (n = 13). Two matched pairs analyses were carried out to identify the 12 (control A) and 13 (control B) surgery-naïve patients. The outcomes were compared between the groups with previous transurethral resection of the prostate (no balloon previous transurethral resection of the prostate laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and with balloon previous transurethral resection of the prostate laparoscopic radical prostatectomy groups) and the controls. The rate of intra- and postoperative complications was assessed. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form and the International Index of Erectile Function 5 were used for symptoms evaluation.  Results:   The mean blood loss was higher in patients submitted to transurethral resection of the prostate, with statistically insignificant reduced blood loss in the with balloon previous transurethral resection of the prostate laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group.

They can be used for primary patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) or serially transplantable PDXs, but only a small proportion of samples grow successfully. To improve the efficiency and quality of PDXs, we investigated the factors that determine the initial engraftment of patient tissues derived from TURP specimens.  Methods:   Fresh tissue was collected from castrate patients who required a TURP for urinary symptoms. Tissue was grafted under the renal capsule of immune-compromised mice for up to 14 weeks. The abundance of cancer in ungrafted and grafted specimens was compared using histopathology. Mice were castrated or implanted with testosterone pellets to determine the androgen-responsiveness of CRPC PDXs from TURP tissue.  Results:   Primary PDXs were successfully established from 7 of 10 patients that underwent grafting. Of the 112 grafts generated from these 10 patients, 21% contained cancer at harvest. Grafts were most successful when the original patient specimens contained high amounts of viable cancer, defined as samples with (i) at least 50% cancer cells, (ii) no physical damage, and (iii) detectable Ki67 expression. PDX grafts survived in castrated hosts and proliferated in response to testosterone, confirming that they were castrate resistant but androgen-responsive.  Conclusions:   Primary PDXs of CRPC can be established from TURP specimens with modest success. The take rate can be increased if the original tissues contain sufficient numbers of actively proliferating cancer cells. Selecting specimens with abundant viable cancer will maximize the rate of engraftment and increase the efficiency of establishing PDXs that can be serially transplanted.""","""['Mitchell G Lawrence', 'David W Pook', 'Hong Wang', 'Laura H Porter', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'John Kourambas', 'Sree Appu', 'Christine Poole', 'Emma K Beardsley', 'Andrew Ryan', 'Sam Norden', 'Melissa M Papargiris', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Renea A Taylor']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Movember GAP1 PDX project: An international collection of serially transplantable prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.', 'Establishing a cryopreservation protocol for patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer.', 'Establishing prostate cancer patient derived xenografts: lessons learned from older studies.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Patient-Derived Prostate Cancer: from Basic Science to the Clinic.', 'Generation, evolution, interfering factors, applications, and challenges of patient-derived xenograft models in immunodeficient mice.', 'The cell-line-derived subcutaneous tumor model in preclinical cancer research.', 'The MURAL collection of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts enables discovery through preclinical models of uro-oncology.', 'Patient-Derived Xenograft Models in Breast Cancer Research.', 'Using the Microwell-mesh to culture microtissues in vitro and as a carrier to implant microtissues in vivo into mice.']"""

In cancer treatment, these therapies exploit the metabolic phenotype associated with oncogenesis and cancer progression. One recent strategy involves the depletion of the cofactors needed to maintain the high rate of glycolysis seen with the Warburg effect. Specifically, blocking nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis via nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition depletes cancer cells of the NAD needed for glycolysis. To characterize this metabolic phenotype in vivo and describe changes in flux with treatment, non-invasive biomarkers are necessary. One such biomarker is hyperpolarized (HP) [1-(13) C] pyruvate, a clinically translatable probe that allows real-time assessment of metabolism.  Methods:   We therefore developed a cell perfusion system compatible with HP magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET) to develop translatable biomarkers of response to NAMPT inhibition in reduced volume cell cultures.  Results:   Using this platform, we observed a reduction in pyruvate flux through lactate dehydrogenase with NAMPT inhibition in prostate cancer cells, and showed that both HP lactate and 2-[(18) F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) can be used as biomarkers for treatment response of such targeted agents. Moreover, we observed dynamic flux changes whereby HP pyruvate was re-routed to alanine, providing both positive and negative indicators of treatment response.

Design, setting, and participants:   Cohort and nested case-control analyses among persons with diabetes. A bladder cancer cohort followed 193,099 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997-2002 until December 2012; 464 case patients and 464 matched controls were surveyed about additional confounders. A cohort analysis of 10 additional cancers included 236,507 persons aged 40 years or older in 1997-2005 and followed until June 2012. Cohorts were from Kaiser Permanente Northern California.  Exposures:   Ever use, duration, cumulative dose, and time since initiation of pioglitazone as time dependent.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incident cancer, including bladder, prostate, female breast, lung/bronchus, endometrial, colon, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, kidney/renal pelvis, rectum, and melanoma.  Results:   Among 193,099 persons in the bladder cancer cohort, 34,181 (18%) received pioglitazone (median duration, 2.8 years; range, 0.2-13.2 years) and 1261 had incident bladder cancer. Crude incidences of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users and nonusers were 89.8 and 75.9 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Ever use of pioglitazone was not associated with bladder cancer risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.26). Results were similar in case-control analyses (pioglitazone use: 19.6% among case patients and 17.5% among controls; adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.78-1.80). In adjusted analyses, there was no association with 8 of the 10 additional cancers; ever use of pioglitazone was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26) and pancreatic cancer (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.71). Crude incidences of prostate and pancreatic cancer in pioglitazone users vs nonusers were 453.3 vs 449.3 and 81.1 vs 48.4 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No clear patterns of risk for any cancer were observed for time since initiation, duration, or dose.  Conclusions and relevance:   Pioglitazone use was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bladder cancer, although an increased risk, as previously observed, could not be excluded.

A total of 16.5% did not have their testosterone level checked at all. Among those prescribed therapy, 1.4% had prostate cancer, 7.6% had obstructive sleep apnea, and 3.5% had elevated hematocrit at baseline.  Conclusions:   Only a small proportion of men receiving testosterone in VA underwent appropriate testing, and some received this therapy despite important contraindications. Promoting a more uniform application of clinical guidelines may facilitate appropriate use of testosterone.""","""['Guneet K Jasuja', 'Shalender Bhasin', 'Joel I Reisman', 'Dan R Berlowitz', 'Adam J Rose']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Care""","""['Irrational Exuberance in Testosterone Prescribing: When Will the Bubble Burst?', 'Who Gets Testosterone?

Advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of prostate cancer provide the opportunity to develop gene-based medicines capable of treating metastatic disease. The aim of this work was to establish a 3D cell culture model of prostate cancer bone metastasis using collagen-based scaffolds, to characterise this model, and to assess the potential of the model to evaluate delivery of gene therapeutics designed to target bone metastases. Two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) were cultured in 2D standard culture and compared to 3D cell growth on three different collagen-based scaffolds (collagen and composites of collagen containing either glycosaminoglycan or nanohydroxyapatite). The 3D model was characterised for cell proliferation, viability and for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) secretion. Chemosensitivity to docetaxel treatment was assessed in 2D in comparison to 3D. Nanoparticles (NPs) containing siRNA formulated using a modified cyclodextrin were delivered to the cells on the scaffolds and gene silencing was quantified. Both prostate cancer cell lines actively infiltrated and proliferated on the scaffolds. Cell culture in 3D resulted in reduced levels of MMP1 and MMP9 secretion in PC3 cells. In contrast, LNCaP cells grown in 3D secreted elevated levels of PSA, particularly on the scaffold composed of collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Both cell lines grown in 3D displayed increased resistance to docetaxel treatment. The cyclodextrin.siRNA nanoparticles achieved cellular uptake and knocked down the endogenous GAPDH gene in the 3D model. In conclusion, development of a novel 3D cell culture model of prostate cancer bone metastasis has been initiated resulting, for the first time, in the successful delivery of gene therapeutics in a 3D in vitro model. Further enhancement of this model will help elucidate the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and also accelerate the design of effective therapies which can penetrate into the bone microenvironment for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Kathleen A Fitzgerald', 'Jianfeng Guo', 'Erica G Tierney', 'Caroline M Curtin', 'Meenakshi Malhotra', 'Raphael Darcy', ""Fergal J O'Brien"", ""Caitriona M O'Driscoll""]""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery assessed in a 3D co-culture model simulating prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Formulation and Evaluation of Anisamide-Targeted Amphiphilic Cyclodextrin Nanoparticles To Promote Therapeutic Gene Silencing in a 3D Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Model.', 'A physiologically relevant 3D collagen-based scaffold-neuroblastoma cell system exhibits chemosensitivity similar to orthotopic xenograft models.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer bone metastases: targeting the lethal phenotype.', 'Machine learning and 3D bioprinting.', 'In vitro models of breast cancer bone metastasis: analyzing drug resistance through the lens of the microenvironment.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'The application of 3D bioprinting in urological diseases.']"""

These observations support the hypothesis that AR isoform accumulation is a consequence of selective therapeutic pressure on the full length AR. The Pten deficient prostate cancer model proceeds with well-defined kinetics including progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While surgical castration and enzalutamide treatments yield an initial therapeutic response, Pten-/-epithelia continue to proliferate yielding locally invasive primary tumor pathology. That most epithelium remains AR positive, but ligand independent, suggests the presence of oncogenic AR variants. To address this hypothesis, we have used a panel of recently described Pten-/- tumor cell lines derived from both from hormone intact (E4, E8) and castrated Pten mutants (cE1, cE2) followed by RACE PCR to identify and characterize three novel truncated, amino terminus containing AR variants (mAR-Va, b, c). Variants appear not only conserved throughout progression but are correlated with nearly complete loss of full length AR (AR-FL) at castrate androgen levels. The overexpression of variants leads to enhanced transcriptional activity of AR while knock down studies show reduced transcriptional output. Collectively, the identification of truncated AR variants in the conditional PTEN deletion model supports a role for maintaining the CRPC phenotype and provides further therapeutic applications of this preclinical model.""","""['Mengmeng Liang', 'Helty Adisetiyo', 'Xiuqing Li', 'Ren Liu', 'Parkash Gill', 'Pradip Roy-Burman', 'Jeremy O Jones', 'David J Mulholland']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Identification of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants in the Pten Deficient Murine Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Regulation of the transcriptional coactivator FHL2 licenses activation of the androgen receptor in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Biologic and clinical significance of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of the Regulatory Targets of miR-3687 and miR-4417 in Prostate Cancer Cells Using a Proteomics Approach.', 'Context-Specific Efficacy of Apalutamide Therapy in Preclinical Models of Pten-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting castration-resistant prostate cancer with androgen receptor antisense oligonucleotide therapy.', 'Vitamin K epoxide reductase regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.']"""

Gal disrupts androgen receptor (AR) signaling via inhibition of CYP17, AR antagonism and AR degradation. Resistance to current therapy is attributed to up-regulation of full-length AR (fAR), splice variants AR (AR-Vs) and AR mutations. The effects of gal and VNPT55 were analyzed on f-AR and AR-Vs (AR-V7/ARv567es) in LNCaP, CWR22Rv1 and DU145 (transfected with AR-Vs) human PC cells in vitro and CRPC tumor xenografts. Galeterone/VNPT55 decreased fAR/AR-V7 mRNA levels and implicates Mdm2/CHIP enhanced ubiquitination of posttranslational modified receptors, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Gal and VNPT55 also induced significant apoptosis in PC cells via increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio, cytochrome-c release with concomitant cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. More importantly, gal and VNPT55 exhibited strong in vivo anti-CRPC activities, with no apparent host toxicities. This study demonstrate that gal and VNPT55 utilize cell-based mechanisms to deplete both fAR and AR-Vs.

Materials and methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with clinically localized (cN0, cM0) pure DC (n = 1328) and AC (n = 751,635) between 1998 and 2011. High-risk AC was defined as Gleason 8-10. Demographic, treatment, pathological, and survival characteristics of patients were compared.  Results:   Compared to patients with Gleason 8-10 AC, those with DC presented with lower mean prostate-specific antigen (10.3 vs 16.2 ng/mL, P <.001), had similar rates (11.7% vs 11.5%, P = .8) of clinical extra-capsular extension (stage ≥ cT3), and were more likely to undergo prostatectomy (54% vs 36%, P <.001). Compared to patients with Gleason 8-10 AC undergoing prostatectomy, those with DC had more favorable pathology: stage ≥ T3 (39% vs 52%, P <.001), fewer positive lymph nodes (4% vs 11%, P <.001), and fewer positive margins (25% vs 33%, P <.001). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with DC had similar 5-year survival (75.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [71.7-78.9]) compared to those with Gleason 8-10 AC (77.1%, 95% CI [76.6%-77.6%], P = .2).

We have here investigated the proteome of urinary exosomes by using mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy male controls. In total, 15 control and 16 prostate cancer samples of urinary exosomes were analyzed. Importantly, 246 proteins were differentially expressed in the two groups. The majority of these proteins (221) were up-regulated in exosomes from prostate cancer patients. These proteins were analyzed according to specific criteria to create a focus list that contained 37 proteins. At 100% specificity, 17 of these proteins displayed individual sensitivities above 60%. Even though several of these proteins showed high sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer as individual biomarkers, combining them in a multi-panel test has the potential for full differentiation of prostate cancer from non-disease controls. The highest sensitivity, 94%, was observed for transmembrane protein 256 (TM256; chromosome 17 open reading frame 61). LAMTOR proteins were also distinctly enriched with very high specificity for patient samples. TM256 and LAMTOR1 could be used to augment the sensitivity to 100%. Other prominent proteins were V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit (VATL), adipogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), and several Rab-class members and proteasomal proteins.

The distribution of mRNA expression levels of 20 validated biomarkers reported to be associated with PC initiation and progression was compared with ethnicity using false discovery rate, adjusted Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, and logistic regression models. A conditional logistic regression model was used to evaluate the interaction between ethnicity and biomarkers for predicting clinicopathologic outcomes.

Patients with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PSA range 2.2-11.7, mean 6.2) and a negative (PIRAD 1-2/5) pre-biopsy mp-MRI (pre-contrast T1, T2, diffusion-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI) who underwent 10-core TRUS-guided biopsy were recruited for additional mp-MRI examinations performed at 1, 2 and 6 months post biopsy. We quantified mp-MRI peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) normalized T2 signal intensity (nT2-SI); T1 relaxation time (T10); diffusion-weighted MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, maximum enhancement (ME); slope of enhancement (SoE) and area-under-the-contrast-enhancement-curve at 120 s (AUC120). Significant changes in mp-MRI parameters were identified by analysis of variance with Dunnett's post testing.  Results:   Diffuse signal changes were observed post-biopsy throughout the PZ. No significant signal change occurred following biopsy within the TZ.

Significant changes (P<0.05) of PZ-ME and AUC120 were observed at 1 month but resolved by 2 months post biopsy. PZ ADC did not change significantly following biopsy (P=0.23-1.0). There was no significant change of any TZ mp-MRI parameter at any time point following biopsy (P=0.1-1.0).  Conclusions:   Significant PZ (but not TZ) T2 signal changes persist up to 6 months post biopsy, whereas PZ and TZ ADC is not significantly altered as early as 1 month post biopsy.

However, these strategies have not been directly compared against an accurate test yet. The aim of this study was to obtain pilot data on the diagnostic ability of visually directed targeted biopsy vs. software-based targeted biopsy, considering transperineal template mapping (TPM) biopsy as the reference test.  Methods and materials:   Prospective paired cohort study included 50 consecutive men undergoing TPM with one or more visible targets detected on preoperative multiparametric MRI. Targets were contoured on the Biojet software. Patients initially underwent software-based targeted biopsies, then visually directed targeted biopsies, and finally systematic TPM. The detection rate of clinically significant disease (Gleason score ≥3+4 and/or maximum cancer core length ≥4mm) of one strategy against another was compared by 3×3 contingency tables. Secondary analyses were performed using a less stringent threshold of significance (Gleason score ≥4+3 and/or maximum cancer core length ≥6mm).  Results:   Median age was 68 (interquartile range: 63-73); median prostate-specific antigen level was 7.9ng/mL (6.4-10.2). A total of 79 targets were detected with a mean of 1.6 targets per patient. Of these, 27 (34%), 28 (35%), and 24 (31%) were scored 3, 4, and 5, respectively. At a patient level, the detection rate was 32 (64%), 34 (68%), and 38 (76%) for visually directed targeted, software-based biopsy, and TPM, respectively. Combining the 2 targeted strategies would have led to detection rate of 39 (78%). At a patient level and at a target level, software-based targeted biopsy found more clinically significant diseases than did visually directed targeted biopsy, although this was not statistically significant (22% vs. 14%, P = 0.48; 51.9% vs. 44.3%, P = 0.24). Secondary analysis showed similar results. Based on these findings, a paired cohort study enrolling at least 257 men would verify whether this difference is statistically significant.  Conclusion:   The diagnostic ability of software-based targeted biopsy and visually directed targeted biopsy seems almost comparable, although utility and efficiency both seem to be slightly in favor of the software-based strategy. Ongoing trials are sufficiently powered to prove or disprove these findings.""","""['Massimo Valerio', 'Neil McCartan', 'Alex Freeman', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim U Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy versus Transperineal Template Prostate Mapping Biopsy in the Detection of Localised Radio-recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'The SmartTarget Biopsy Trial: A Prospective, Within-person Randomised, Blinded Trial Comparing the Accuracy of Visual-registration and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Image-fusion Targeted Biopsies for Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Transperineal US-MRI Fusion-Guided Biopsy for the Detection of Clinical Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Cognitive and Software-Assisted Technique.', 'Pathological Accuracy in Prostate Cancer: Single-Center Outcomes of 3 Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy Techniques and Random Systematic Biopsy.', 'How to Improve TRUS-Guided Target Biopsy following Prostate MRI.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Techniques in Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Prostate Ablation.']"""

The anatomy of the pelvic fossae is presented, including the recto-vesical pouch (pouch of Douglas) created by the reflections of the peritoneum. The actual technique of the trans-Douglas, intrafascial nerve-sparing robotic radical prostatectomy is described. The technique allows the prostate gland to be shelled out from under the overlying detrusor apron and dorsal vascular complex (DVC-Santorini plexus), entirely avoiding the pubovesical ligaments. There is no need to control the DVC, since the line of dissection passes beneath the plexus. Three key points to ensure enhanced nerve preservation should be respected: (1) the tips of the seminal vesicles, enclosed in a ""cage"" of neuronal tissue; a seminal vesicle-sparing technique is therefore advised when oncologically safe; (2) the external prostate-vesicular angle; (3) the lateral surface of the prostate gland and the apex. The principles of tension and energy-free dissection should guide all the maneuvers in order to minimize neuropathy. Using robotic technology, a complete intrafascial dissection of the prostate gland can be achieved through the Douglas space, reducing surgical trauma and providing excellent functional and oncological outcomes.""","""['Anastasios D Asimakopoulos', 'Roberto Miano', 'Antonio Galfano', 'Aldo Massimo Bocciardi', 'Giuseppe Vespasiani', 'Enrico Spera', 'Richard Gaston']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Anat""","""['Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with intrafascial dissection of the neurovascular bundles and preservation of the pubovesical complex: a step-by-step description of the technique.', 'Complete periprostatic anatomy preservation during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP): the new pubovesical complex-sparing technique.', 'Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy with a laparoscopic robot-assisted extraperitoneal approach: early oncological and functional results.', 'Anatomic and technical considerations for optimizing recovery of sexual function during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Anatomical basis for carrying out a state-of-the-art radical prostatectomy.', 'The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy-a Contemporary Review.', 'Is Retzius-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy effective in early continence?

Methods:   This retrospective study included 172 consecutive patients with PC who underwent FCH PET/CT for biochemical recurrence. Mean rising PSA was 10.7 ± 35.0 ng/ml. Patients with positive FCH PET were classified into three groups: those with uptake only in the prostatic bed, those with locoregional disease, and those with distant metastases. Referring physicians were asked to indicate the hypothetical therapeutic strategy with and without the FCH PET/CT results. Clinical variables and PET parameters including SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, total lesion choline kinase activity (TLCKA) and standardized added metabolic activity (SAM) were recorded and a multivariate analysis was performed to determine the factors independently predicting PFS.  Results:   In 137 of the 172 patients, the FCH PET/CT scan was positive, and of these, 29.9 % (41/137) had prostatic recurrence, 42.3 % (58/137) had pelvic lymph node recurrence with or without prostatic recurrence, and 27.7 % (38/137) had distant metastases. The FCH PET/CT result led to a change in treatment plan in 43.6 % (75/172) of the 172 patients. Treatment was changed in 49.6 % (68/137) of those with a positive FCH PET/CT scan and in 20 % (7/35) of those with a negative FCH PET/CT scan. After a median follow-up of 29.3 months (95 % CI 18.9 - 45.9 months), according to multivariate analysis age <70 years, SAM ≥23 and SUVmean ≥3 were parameters independently predicting PFS. A nomogram constructed using the three parameters showed 49 months of PFS in patients with the best scores (0 or 1) and only 11 months in patients with a poor score (score 3).

Methods and materials:   Multileaf collimator tracking was implemented for 15 patients in a prostate cancer radiation therapy trial; in total, 513 treatment fractions were delivered. During each treatment fraction, the prostate trajectory and treatment MLC positions were collected. These data were used as input for dose reconstruction (multiple isocenter shift method) to calculate the treated dose (with MLC tracking) and the dose that would have been delivered had MLC tracking not been applied (without MLC tracking). The percentage difference from planned for target and normal tissue dose-volume points were calculated. The hypothesis was tested for each dose-volume value via analysis of variance using the F test.  Results:   Of the 513 fractions delivered, 475 (93%) were suitable for analysis. The mean difference and standard deviation between the planned and treated MLC tracking doses and the planned and without-MLC tracking doses for all 475 fractions were, respectively, PTV D99% -0.8% ± 1.1% versus -2.1% ± 2.7%; CTV D99% -0.6% ± 0.8% versus -0.6% ± 1.1%; rectum V65% 1.6% ± 7.9% versus -1.2% ± 18%; and bladder V65% 0.5% ± 4.4% versus -0.0% ± 9.2% (P<.001 for all dose-volume results).

A patient had advanced prostate cancer with multiple metastases in the lung, pelvis, femur, and perhaps the sacrum. In April 2013, this 60-year-old patient started treatment with leuprorelin and estradiol, which continued until July 2014, but the patient became refractory to this treatment. So the patient underwent proton beam radiotherapy targeted to the primary prostate cancer, and P-THP was administered for numerous metastatic tumor nodules concomitantly with radiotherapy. This combination therapy had remarkable results, with complete remission of multiple metastases in the lung and bone.

We conducted a nationwide study to determine whether family history of VTE is a risk factor for hospitalized VTE in cancer patients.  Methods:   The Swedish Multi-Generation Register was linked to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and the Swedish Cancer Registry. Familial (sibling/parent history of VTE) hazard ratios (HRs) for VTE in 20 cancer types were determined by cause-specific Cox regression for 258877 cancer patients in 1987-2010 without previous VTE. Familial HRs were also determined in 7644203 individuals without cancer or VTE before 1987, with follow-up in 1987-2010.  Results:   Significant familial HRs for VTE in cancer patients were observed for the following cancer types: cancers of the breast (HR=1.79), lung (HR=1.21), colon (HR=1.30), prostate (HR=1.46), testis (HR=2.02), nervous system (HR=1.31), stomach (HR=1.73), and rectum (HR=1.77), as well as melanoma (HR=1.71), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR=1.32), myeloma (HR=1.69), and leukemia (HR=1.44). In a time-dependent analysis the familial HRs for VTE were significant before diagnosis of cancer (p-values <0.0001). After diagnosis of cancer the familial HRs VTE were weaker, with significant HRs for 12 cancer types. On an additive scale, the joint effect of cancer and family history was significantly increased compared to separate effects in four cancer types. However, for certain cancers the familial VTE cases were limited.  Conclusions:   Family history of VTE is a risk factor for VTE in several cancer types.

However, exploration of intrarural cancer incidence may have important public health implications for risk assessment, cancer control, and resource allocation.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to explore intrastate rural cancer risk and incidence differences within Illinois.  Design:   Illinois's 83 rural counties were categorized into northern, central, and southern regions (IL-N, IL-C, and IL-S, respectively). Chi-square test for independence and analysis of variance calculations were performed to assess regional differences in demographic characteristics, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking history, obesity, cancer-screening adherence, and density of general practitioners. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 5 cancer categories: all cancers combined, lung, colorectal, breast (female), and prostate cancers. Unadjusted and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to evaluate regional differences in rates for each cancer category.  Results:   Socioeconomic deprivation varied by region: 4.5%, 6.9%, and 40.6% of IL-N, IL-C, and IL-S counties, respectively (P < .001). Smoking history also significantly differed by region. Mean former/current smoking prevalence in IL-N, IL-C, and IL-S counties was 46.4%, 48.2%, and 51.4%, respectively (P = .006). In unadjusted analysis, IL-C (IRR = 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.23) and IL-S (IRR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.35) had increased lung cancer incidence compared with IL-N.

Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis and indirect comparison to assess the efficacy and safety of ET-A receptor antagonists for treatment of CRPC.  Methods:   We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to November 2014 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed ET-A receptor antagonists for treatment of CRPC. Meta-analysis was conducted by STATA version 12.0 software.  Results:   Eight RCTs were identified, involving 6,065 patients. The results of direct comparison showed that compared with placebo, there was no statistically significant difference in the improvement of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to disease progression (TTP), and total adverse events (AEs) with ET-A receptor antagonist treatment for CRPC. The results of ET-A receptor antagonists plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone were similar. The indirect comparisons showed that there were no significant differences between zibotentan plus docetaxel versus atrasentan plus docetaxel when compared with docetaxel alone or zibotentan versus atrasenta compared with placebo in the improvement of PFS, OS, TTP, and total adverse events.  Conclusions:   There were no significant benefits for ET-A receptor antagonists with or without docetaxel in the improvement of PFS, OS, TTP, and overall AEs. And there were no significant differences between zibotentan and atrasentan.

Materials and methods:   The cohort included 392 men with Gleason 6 prostate cancer on initial biopsy undergoing confirmatory biopsy. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression to assess if high grade cancer (Gleason 7 or greater) on confirmatory biopsy could be predicted from initial diagnostic parameters (prostate specific antigen density, magnetic resonance imaging result, percent positive cores, percent cancer in positive cores and total tumor length).  Results:   Median patient age was 62 years (IQR 56-66) and 47% of patients had a dominant or focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 392 patients 44 (11%) had high grade cancer on confirmatory biopsy, of whom 39 had Gleason 3+4, 1 had 4+3, 3 had Gleason 8 and 1 had Gleason 9 disease. All predictors were significantly associated with high grade cancer at confirmatory biopsy on univariate analysis. However, in the multivariable model only prostate specific antigen density and total tumor length were significantly associated (AUC 0.85). Using this model to select patients for confirmatory biopsy would generally provide a higher net benefit than performing confirmatory biopsy in all patients, across a wide range of threshold probabilities.

We examined the association of prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater at diagnosis with distant metastasis and prostate cancer specific survival.  Material and methods:   A total of 15,635 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2009 who were identified in PCBaSe (Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden 2.0) were included in a population based registry study. Prostate cancer specific survival was compared among 3 groups, including 1,879 men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater and negative imaging (M0), 5,642 with distant metastases on imaging (M1) and prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater, and 3,828 with M1 and prostate specific antigen less than 100 ng/ml. A fourth group consisted of 4,286 men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater who had not undergone imaging (Mx). The latter men were not included in the assessment of survival.  Results:   Of 7,521 men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater who underwent imaging for staging 75% were classified with M1 disease. Only 59% of 3,527 men with prostate specific antigen 100 to 300 mg/ml had distant metastases on imaging. Five-year prostate cancer specific survival was 72% (95% CI 70-74) in men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater and M0, 24% (95% CI 23-25) in men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater and M1, and 39% (95% CI 37-40) in men with prostate specific antigen less than 100 ng/ml and M1.  Conclusions:   A fourth of men with prostate specific antigen 100 ng/ml or greater did not have distant metastases.

APIM-indicated that the association between holding back sharing concerns, and patient and spouse distress, well-being, and relationship satisfaction could be partially accounted for by their influence on patient and spouse perceptions of relationship intimacy.

In most cases, only general models are used without taking into account patient-specific features. However, patient specificity has proven to be crucial in guiding clinical practice because of disastrous consequences that can arise should the model be inaccurate. This paper proposes a framework for the computational modeling applied to the example of the male pelvic cavity for the purpose of prostate cancer diagnostics using palpation. The effects of patient specific structural features on palpation response are studied in three selected patients with very different pathophysiological conditions whose pelvic cavities are reconstructed from MRI scans. In particular, the role of intrabladder pressure in the outcome of digital rectal examination is investigated with the objective of providing guidelines to practitioners to enhance the effectiveness of diagnosis. Furthermore, the presence of the pelvic bone in the model is assessed to determine the pathophysiological conditions in which it has to be modeled. The conclusions and suggestions of this work have potential use not only in clinical practice and also for biomechanical modeling where structural patient-specificity needs to be considered. © 2015 The Authors.

Clinical, pathological, and SRT characteristics were evaluated for association with BCR using relative risks (RRs) from multivariable Cox regression models.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 5.5 years after SRT, 354 patients (61%) experienced BCR. At 5 years after SRT, 40% of patients were free of BCR. Independent associations with BCR were identified for the PSA level before SRT (RR [doubling]: 1.25, P < 0.001), pathological tumour stage (RR [T3a vs T2] 1.21, P = 0.19; RR [T3b/T4 vs T2] 2.09, P < 0.001; overall P < 0.001), Gleason score (RR [7 vs <7] 1.63, P < 0.001; RR [8-10 vs <7] 2.28, P < 0.001; overall P < 0.001), and surgical margin status (RR [positive vs negative] 0.71, P = 0.003). We combined these four variables to create a prognostic scoring system that predicted BCR risk with a c-index of 0.66. Scores ranged from 0 to 7, and 5-year freedom from BCR for different levels of the score was as follows: Score = 0-1: 66%, Score = 2: 46%, Score = 3: 28%, Score = 4: 19%, and Score = 5-7: 15%.

The urachus is left intact for an exposure/retraction point. The anatomy is described in terms of lymph nodes (LNs) that are easily retrieved vs those that require additional manipulation of the anatomy, and a determined surgeon. A representative cohort of 167 RARPs was queried for representative metrics that distinguish the ePLND: 146 primary cases and 21 with neoadjuvant systemic therapy.  Results:   The median (interquartile range, IQR) LN yield was 22 (16-28) for primary surgeries and 21 (16-23) for neoadjuvant cases. The percentage of cases with positive LNs (pN1) was 16.4% for primary and 29% for neoadjuvant. The hypogastric LNs were involved in 75% of pN1 primary cases and uniquely positive in 33%.

Patients and methods:   Caveolin-1 expression was evaluated by immunochemistry on a tissue microarray in 3 117 patients treated with RP for prostate cancer at five institutions. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed the association of Caveolin-1 status with BCR. Harrell's c-index quantified prognostic accuracy.  Results:   Caveolin-1 was overexpressed in 644 (20.6%) patients and was associated with higher pathological Gleason sum (P = 0.002) and lymph node metastases (P = 0.05). Within a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 38 (21-66) months, 617 (19.8%) patients experienced BCR. Patients with overexpression of Caveolin-1 had worse BCR-free survival than those with normal expression (log-rank test, P = 0.004). Caveolin-1 was an independent predictor of BCR in multivariable analyses that adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathological features (hazard ratio 1.21, P = 0.037). Addition of Caveolin-1 in a model for prediction of BCR based on these standard prognosticators did not significantly improve the predictive accuracy of the model. In subgroup analyses, Caveolin-1 was associated with BCR in patients with favourable pathological features (pT2pN0 and Gleason score = 6; P = 0.021).  Conclusions:   We confirmed that overexpression of Caveolin-1 is associated with adverse pathological features in prostate cancer and independently predicts BCR after RP, especially in patients with favourable pathological features.

We focussed on patients who were treatment naive, with the aim of determining if SBRT could delay disease progression. We included patients with three or fewer metastases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and local progression-free survival (LPFS). Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. In total, 163 metastases were treated in 119 patients. The median DPFS was 21 mo (95% confidence interval, 15-26 mo). A lower radiotherapy dose predicted a higher local recurrence rate with a 3-yr LPFS of 79% for patients treated with a biologically effective dose ≤100Gy versus 99% for patients treated with >100Gy (p=0.01). Seventeen patients (14%) developed toxicity classified as grade 1, and three patients (3%) developed grade 2 toxicity. No grade ≥3 toxicity occurred. These results should serve as a benchmark for future prospective trials.

We previously demonstrated that hypoxia up-regulated RUNX2 in tumour cells, which in turn up-regulated the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. Here, we investigate the impact of nitric oxide (NO) on RUNX2 and Bcl-2 expression in prostate cancer and further, how RUNX2 over-expression can impact tumour growth, angiogenesis and oxygenation in vivo. The effect of NO levels on RUNX2 and thus Bcl-2 expression was examined in prostate cancer cells in vitro using methods including gene and protein expression analyses, nitrite quantitation, protein-DNA interaction assays (ChIP) and viability assays (XTT). The effect of RUNX2 over-expression on tumour physiology (growth, oxygenation and angiogenesis) was also assessed in vivo using LNCaP xenografts. A low (but not high) concentration of NO (10 μM) induced expression of RUNX2 and Bcl-2, conferring resistance to docetaxel. These effects were induced via the ERK and PI3K pathways and were dependent on intact AP-1 binding sites in the RUNX2 promoter. RUNX2 over-expression in LNCaP tumours in vivo decreased the time to tumour presentation and increased tumour growth. Moreover, these tumours exhibited improved tumour angiogenesis and oxygenation. Low levels of NO increase expression of RUNX2 and Bcl-2 in LNCaP prostate tumour cells, and in vivo up-regulation of RUNX2 created tumours with a more malignant phenotype.

Unfortunately, these measurements give no insight into the details of the cellular-level mechanisms acting to close the initially-vacant area. We provide an alternative method enabling us to quantify the role of cell motility and cell proliferation separately. To achieve this we calibrate standard data available from IncuCyte ZOOM(™) images to the solution of the Fisher-Kolmogorov model.  Results:   The Fisher-Kolmogorov model is a reaction-diffusion equation that has been used to describe collective cell spreading driven by cell migration, characterised by a cell diffusivity, D, and carrying capacity limited proliferation with proliferation rate, λ, and carrying capacity density, K. By analysing temporal changes in cell density in several subregions located well-behind the initial position of the leading edge we estimate λ and K. Given these estimates, we then apply automatic leading edge detection algorithms to the images produced by the IncuCyte ZOOM(™) assay and match this data with a numerical solution of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation to provide an estimate of D. We demonstrate this method by applying it to interpret a suite of IncuCyte ZOOM(™) assays using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and obtain estimates of D, λ and K. Comparing estimates of D, λ and K for a control assay with estimates of D, λ and K for assays where epidermal growth factor (EGF) is applied in varying concentrations confirms that EGF enhances the rate of scratch closure and that this stimulation is driven by an increase in D and λ, whereas K is relatively unaffected by EGF.  Conclusions:   Our approach for estimating D, λ and K from an IncuCyte ZOOM(™) assay provides more detail about cellular-level behaviour than standard methods for analysing these assays. In particular, our approach can be used to quantify the balance of cell migration and cell proliferation and, as we demonstrate, allow us to quantify how the addition of growth factors affects these processes individually.""","""['Stuart T Johnston', 'Esha T Shah', 'Lisa K Chopin', 'D L Sean McElwain', 'Matthew J Simpson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Reproducibility of scratch assays is affected by the initial degree of confluence: Experiments, modelling and model selection.', 'Quantifying the effect of experimental design choices for in vitro scratch assays.', 'Interpreting scratch assays using pair density dynamics and approximate Bayesian computation.', 'Quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates for stochastic models of collective cell spreading using approximate Bayesian computation.', 'The role of diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of ischemic brain injury - a review.', 'Geometric analysis enables biological insight from complex non-identifiable models using simple surrogates.', 'High-throughput screening of toxicants that modulate extravillous trophoblast migration.', 'Integration of quantitative methods and mathematical approaches for the modeling of cancer cell proliferation dynamics.', 'Anticancer Effects of Propolis Extracts Obtained with the Cold Separation Method on PC-3 and DU-145 Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Decoding molecular programs in melanoma brain metastases.']"""

Cabazitaxel might, however, remain effective in AR-V7-positive patients.  Objective:   To investigate the association between AR-V7 expression in CTCs and resistance to cabazitaxel.  Design, setting, and participants:   We selected patients with mCRPC from the multicenter, randomized, phase 2, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in mCRPC on the pharmacodynamic effects of budesonide on cabazitaxel (Jevtana) (CABARESC). Before the start of the first and third cabazitaxel cycle, CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch System. In patients with ≥10 CTCs in 7.5 ml blood at baseline, the expression of AR-V7 was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was the association between the AR-V7 status and the CTC response rate (decrease to fewer than five CTCs in 7.5 ml blood during treatment). Secondary end points were the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Analyses were performed using chi-square and log-rank tests.  Results and limitations:   AR-V7 was detected in 16 of 29 patients (55%) with ≥10 CTCs and was more frequently found in abiraterone pretreated patients (5 of 5 [100%] treated vs 7 of 20 [35%] untreated; p=0.009). We found no differences in CTC and PSA RRs. The presence of AR-V7 in CTCs was not associated with progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.8) or overall survival (HR 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6-4.4).  Conclusions:   The response to cabazitaxel seems to be independent of the AR-V7 status of CTCs from mCRPC patients. Consequently, cabazitaxel might be a valid treatment option for patients with AR-V7-positive CTCs.

Mortality data are readily available for states and counties, but not for congressional districts, from which representatives are elected and which may be more influential in compelling legislation and policy. The authors calculated average annual cancer death rates during 2002 to 2011 for each of the 435 congressional districts using mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates from the US Census Bureau. Age-standardized death rates were mapped for all sites combined and separately for cancers of the lung and bronchus, colorectum, breast, and prostate by race/ethnicity and sex. Overall cancer death rates vary by almost 2-fold and are generally lowest in Mountain states and highest in Appalachia and areas of the South. The distribution is similar for lung and colorectal cancers, with the lowest rates consistently noted in districts in Utah. However, for breast and prostate cancers, while the highest rates are again scattered throughout the South, the geographic pattern is less clear and the lowest rates are in Hawaii and southern Texas and Florida. Within-state heterogeneity is limited, particularly for men, with the exceptions of Texas, Georgia, and Florida. Patterns also vary by race/ethnicity. For example, the highest prostate cancer death rates are in the West and north central United States among non-Hispanic whites, but in the deep South among African Americans. Hispanics have the lowest rates except for colorectal cancer in Wyoming, eastern Colorado, and northern New Mexico. These data can facilitate cancer control and stimulate conversation about the relationship between cancer and policies that influence access to health care and the prevalence of behavioral and environmental risk factors.""","""['Rebecca L Siegel', 'Liora Sahar', 'Kenneth M Portier', 'Elizabeth M Ward', 'Ahmedin Jemal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['U.S. congressional district cancer death rates.', 'Cancer statistics for Hispanics/Latinos, 2015.', 'Cancer survival in five continents: a worldwide population-based study (CONCORD).', 'Cancer statistics, 2004.', 'Geographic Variability in Liver Disease-Related Mortality Rates in the United States.', 'Sig1R activates extracellular matrix-induced bladder cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis by combing β-integrin.', 'Pharmacogenomics and health disparities, are we helping?', 'Aptamer-Functionalized Iron-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Synergistic Cascade Cancer Chemotherapy and Chemodynamic Therapy.', 'The role of Fbxo5 in the development of human malignant tumors.', 'The functional roles of the circRNA/Wnt axis in cancer.']"""

FKBP52 is a positive regulator of AR in cellular and whole animal models and is required for the development of androgen-dependent tissues. We previously characterized an AR inhibitor termed MJC13 that putatively targets the AR BF3 surface to specifically inhibit FKBP52-regulated AR signaling. Predictive modeling suggests that β-catenin interacts with the AR hormone binding domain on a surface that overlaps with BF3. Here we demonstrate that FKBP52 and β-catenin interact directly in vitro and act in concert to promote a synergistic up-regulation of both hormone-independent and -dependent AR signaling. Our data demonstrate that FKBP52 promotes β-catenin interaction with AR and is required for β-catenin co-activation of AR activity in prostate cancer cells. MJC13 effectively blocks β-catenin interaction with the AR LBD and the synergistic up-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin. Our data suggest that co-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin does not require FKBP52 PPIase catalytic activity, nor FKBP52 binding to Hsp90.

Rac1 is a small G-protein which upon activation results in formation of lamellipodia, the first protrusions formed by migrating cells. We have previously shown that Snail promotes cell migration through down-regulation of maspin tumor suppressor. We hypothesized that Snail's regulation of cell migration may also involve Rac1 signaling regulated by PI3K/AKT and/or MAPK pathways. We found that Snail overexpression in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells increased Rac1 activity associated with increased cell migration, and the Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, could inhibit Snail-mediated cell migration. Conversely, Snail downregulation using shRNA in the aggressive C4-2 prostate cancer cells decreased Rac1 activity and cell migration. Moreover, Snail overexpression increased ERK and PI3K/AKT activity in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Treatment of Snail-overexpressing 22Rv1 cells with LY294002, PI3K/AKT inhibitor or U0126, MEK inhibitor, decreased cell migration significantly, but only LY294002 significantly reduced Rac1 activity, suggesting that Snail promotes Rac1 activation via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, 22Rv1 cells overexpressing Snail displayed decreased maspin levels, while inhibition of maspin expression in 22Rv1 cells with siRNA, led to increased PI3K/AKT, Rac1 activity and cell migration, without affecting ERK activity, suggesting that maspin is upstream of PI3K/AKT. Overall, we have dissected signaling pathways by which Snail may promote cell migration through MAPK signaling or alternatively through PI3K/AKT-Rac1 signaling that involves Snail inhibition of maspin tumor suppressor.

Patients and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to study 40 533 men diagnosed with N0M0 Gleason score 8 or 9 prostate cancer from 2004 to 2011. Using Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 as the referent, Fine and Gray competing risks regression analyses modelled the association between Gleason score and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   The 5-year PCSM rates for patients with Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 3 = 8, and 9 disease were 6.3%, 6.6%, 13.5%, and 13.9%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Material and methods:   Twelve technologists realized 286 CBCT/CT registrations (bone registration followed by prostate to prostate registration). The registration results were compared to those obtained by two radiation oncologists (reference). Each technologist reported the shifts calculated by the software in all three axes. A statistical analysis allowed us to calculate the minimum threshold under which 95% of the observers found similar values. A variance analysis followed by the post hoc test were used to find differences in interobserver registration variability and determine whether any individual users performed registrations which differed significantly from those of the other users.  Results:   The registration differences compared to the reference in the three directions in terms of 95th percentile are: 2.1mm left-right, 3.5mm target-gun, 7.3mm anterior-posterior. In the posterior direction, 4% of the observers have found differences superior to 8mm, margin used in routine without the use of a daily CBCT. The variance test revealed a P-value <0.05 only for target-gun and for all observers there was no significant difference compared to the reference.  Conclusion:   This study confirmed the interest of a 3D tissue registration for prostate treatments. The registration study showed a good interobserver reproducibility. This showed the importance of a daily CBCT/CT registration in prostate treatment with the possibility of a planning target volume margin reduction in the three directions.

Early stages of tumor development were unaffected, but progression to advanced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was severely inhibited. Dgcr8 loss blocked Pten null-induced expansion of the basal-like, but not luminal, cellular compartment. Furthermore, while late-stage Pten knockout tumors exhibit decreased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and increased proliferation, the simultaneous deletion of Dgcr8 blocked these changes resulting in levels similar to wild type. Sequencing of small RNAs in isolated epithelial cells uncovered numerous miRNA changes associated with PTEN loss. Consistent with a Pten-Dgcr8 association, analysis of a large cohort of human prostate tumors shows a strong correlation between Akt activation and increased Dgcr8 mRNA levels.

Methods:   14 prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy patients with 2 planning CTs were identified. For both CTs, OB was delineated using model-based segmentation. IB was delineated manually. Then, using uniform contractions from OB, the position of IB was approximated using a: 2.5-mm contraction, patient-specific contraction, patient-specific constant wall volume method and variable wall volume method. The structures created using those strategies were compared against the manual IB contours using geometric and dosimetric indices.  Results:   In the presence of variable bladder filling, use of a generic or patient-specific constant contraction resulted in a significant overestimation of IB volume (+12 and +13 cm(3), respectively; p < 0.001) that was inversely correlated with the difference in urine volume between the scans (R(2) > 0.86). Mean differences across 95% of IB surfaces were ≤2 mm for methods using either constant or variable wall volume. Mean dose-volume histogram (DVH) differences were <1 cm(3) across the whole BW DVH when using the method that assumed a variable wall volume.  Conclusion:   The variable volume BW model provided the best approximation of the IB surface position under varying filling conditions, based on geometric and dosimetric indices.

Previous studies have reported that valproic acid (VPA) suppresses prostate carcinoma (PCa) cell metastasis and down-regulates SMAD4 protein levels, which is the key molecule in TGF-β-induced EMT. However, the correlation between VPA and the EMT in PCa remains uncertain.  Methods:   Markers of the EMT in PCa cells and xenografts were molecularly assessed after VPA treatment. The expression and mono-ubiquitination of SMAD4 were also analyzed. After transfection with plasmids that express SMAD4 or short hairpin RNA for SMAD4 down-regulation, markers of EMT were examined to confirm whether VPA inhibits the EMT of PCa cells through the suppression of SMAD4.  Results:   VPA induced the increase in E-cadherin (p < 0.05), and the decrease in N-cadherin (p < 0.05) and Vimentin (p < 0.05), in PCa cells and xenografts. SMAD4 mRNA and protein levels were repressed by VPA (p < 0.05), whereas the level of mono-ubiquitinated SMAD4 was increased (p < 0.05). SMAD4 knockdown significantly increased E-cadherin expression in PC3 cells, but SMAD4 over-expression abolished the VPA-mediated EMT-inhibitory effect.  Conclusions:   VPA inhibits the EMT in PCa cells via the inhibition of SMAD4 expression and the mono-ubiquitination of SMAD4. VPA could serve as a promising agent in PCa treatment, with new strategies based on its diverse effects on posttranscriptional regulation.""","""['Xiaopeng Lan', 'Guoliang Lu', 'Chuanwei Yuan', 'Shaowei Mao', 'Wei Jiang', 'Yougen Chen', 'Xunbo Jin', 'Qinghua Xia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Up-regulation of TIF1γ by valproic acid inhibits the epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate carcinoma through TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.', 'Valproic acid inhibits epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in renal cell carcinoma by decreasing SMAD4 expression.', 'Quercetin modulates Wnt signaling components in prostate cancer cell line by inhibiting cell viability, migration, and metastases.', 'Combination Therapies Using Metformin and/or Valproic Acid in Prostate Cancer: Possible Mechanistic Interactions.', '27-hydroxycholesterol: A novel player in molecular carcinogenesis of breast and prostate cancer.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

Objective:   To identify specific patients who would benefit from LTA more than PN.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based assessment was performed of 2476 patients in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database who had cT1a kidney cancer treated with either LTA or PN, between 2000 and 2009.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome of the study was the relevant perioperative complications rate. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict the risk of complications after PN. Model-derived coefficients were used to calculate the risk of complication in case of PN among patients treated with LTA. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method was used to plot the observed complication rate against the predicted risk of complication in case of PN.  Results and limitations:   At multivariable logistic regression, age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; p<0.001), Charlson comorbidity index (OR: 1.14; p<0.001), acute kidney injury (OR: 1.91; p=0.04), or chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.16; p=0.002), tumour size (OR: 1.02; p=0.01), and minimally invasive approach (OR: 0.77; p<0.03) emerged as significant predictors of complications. When LTA was chosen over PN, the reduction in the risk of complications was greatest in high-risk patients, intermediate in intermediate-risk patients, and least in low-risk patients.  Conclusions:   When postoperative complications are evaluated, the benefit of choosing LTA is not the same in all patients diagnosed with T1a kidney cancer. Specifically, patients at high risk of complications in case of PN may benefit the most from LTA and represent ideal LTA candidates.

Several treatments have been proposed, with varying outcomes. The available data are difficult to interpret, because patient and disease characteristics differ significantly among reports. Details of long-term follow-up and functional status are rarely provided. We describe a technique of rectourethral fistula repair via an intersphincteric route.  Methods:   Preoperative workup included proctoscopy and urethrocystography. All patients already had a stoma at the time of fistula repair. Mechanical cleansing of the bowel distal to the colostomy was routinely performed, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. Patients were placed in the lithotomy position. Under spinal anesthesia, a curvilinear anteanal incision was made, to expose the external sphincter. The anterior portion of the external sphincter was gently displaced along half of its circumference. The anterior rectal wall was sharply dissected free from the urethra, approximately up to 2 cm above the fistula level through the intersphincteric plane. The fistula was identified. The surrounding tissues were mobilized to obtain a tension-free repair of the urethral defect, using a single row of 4-0 polyglactin transverse, interrupted sutures. Transanally, a U-shaped full-thickness rectal flap was advanced and sutured with 3-0 monofilament interrupted sutures to cover the rectal opening, and care was taken to ensure that the two suture lines were in different planes. The catheter was left in place for 4 weeks. Patients were evaluated at 3-month follow-up for stoma closure.  Results:   We successfully treated five patients. Only one minor complication was observed (surgical site infection). Stomas were taken down uneventfully. After a median follow-up duration of 2 years (range 2-3 years), no patients had fistula recurrence or impaired continence.  Conclusions:   Intersphincteric repair should be considered as an effective option in patients with iatrogenic rectourethral fistulas. This technique offers several advantages over alternative procedures that require more extensive approaches or invasive manipulation of the anal sphincters.""","""['A Amato', 'G Pellino', 'P Secondo', 'F Selvaggi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tech Coloproctol""","""['Minimally Invasive Transanal Repair of Rectourethral Fistulas.', 'Transanal repair of rectourethral fistula after a radical retropubic prostatectomy: report of a case.', 'Transperineal management for postoperative and radiation rectourethral fistulas.', 'Rectourethral fistulas in the cancer survivor.', 'Acquired rectourethral fistula: methods of repair.', 'Prostatic abscesses.

However, the data on clinical outcomes in these patients are limited. In this study we assess pathological and survival outcomes in patients with cN1-3 disease treated with induction chemotherapy and radical cystectomy.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected on patients from 19 North American and European centers with cT1-4aN1-N3 urothelial carcinoma who received chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy between 2000 and 2013. The primary end points were pathological complete (pT0N0) and partial (pT1N0 or less) response rates, with overall survival as a secondary end point. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard ratios were used for multivariate analysis of factors predicting these outcomes.  Results:   The total of 304 patients had clinical evidence of lymph node involvement (cN1-N3). Methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin was used in 128 (42%), gemcitabine/cisplatin in 132 (43%) and other regimens in 44 (15%) patients. The pN0 rate was 48% (cN1-56%, cN2-39%, cN3-39%, p=0.03). The complete and partial pathological response rates for the entire cohort were 14.5% and 27%, respectively. The estimated median overall survival time for the cohort was 22 months (IQR 8.0, 54). On Cox regression analysis overall survival was associated with pN0, negative surgical margins, removal of 15 or more pelvic nodes and cisplatin therapy.  Conclusions:   Complete pathological nodal response can be achieved in a proportion of patients with cN1-3 disease receiving induction chemotherapy.

Methods:   Weighted data from the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 NHANES databases was analyzed. A subpopulation of male participants was selected who were older than one year of age, had completed two days of dietary recall including supplement usage, and had fasted for at least 4 h prior to having their serum folate measured. Total dietary folate equivalent (DFE) intake (mcg) represented the combination of all natural food folate and folic acid from fortification and dietary supplements. Geometric means of serum folate (nM), red blood cell (RBC) folate (nM), and DFE intake were calculated for nine consecutive age groups, with each group generally representing a 10 year span. Analysis was then focused on males older than 20 years of age.  Results:   A total of 19,142 subjects were in the initial NHANES population, which represented over 294 million people within the United States. Applying our inclusion criteria created a final subpopulation size of 3775. Subsequent analysis of the age groups for all males older than 20 years found the following: The mean serum folate (nM) with 95% CI levels ranged from 28.2 (26.6, 29.9) to 55.1 (47.5, 63.9). RBC folate (nM) concentrations with 95% CI levels without any fasting exclusions ranged from 795.6 (741.5, 853.7) to 1038.4 (910.7, 1184.2). Serum and RBC folate concentrations were significantly higher with age across these age groups (p < 0.001). However, the mean total daily DFE intake did not significantly differ ranging from 640.4 (574.7, 713.7) to 720.2 (665, 780) mcg, (p = 0.373). Serum folate concentrations in men with total daily DFE intake of at least 1000 mcg increased more significantly with increasing age than serum folate concentrations in men with less than 400 mcg of total daily DFE intake (p < 0.001).

At later stages, however, the growth of prostate cancers becomes androgen independent, which leads to an increase in mortality. The switch to an androgen-refractory state is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of prostate cancer cells. Several factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased cAMP production promote NED of prostate cancer cells. In this work we investigated whether IL-6 evoked NED of LNCaP cells results in a significant change in T-type Ca(2+) channel expression in comparison to non-stimulated LNCaP cells.  Methods:   T-type Ca(2+) channel subunit Cav3.2 expression was studied using PCR analysis, western blot and whole cell recordings. Tubulin IIIβ expression and neurite-like morphology was assessed to investigate the role of T-type Ca(2+) channels in the differentiation of prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Treatment of LNCaP cells with IL-6 for 4days evokes considerable morphological and biochemical changes consistent with NED. Transcripts of the T-type Ca(2+) channel subunit Cav3.2 but not Cav3.1 or Cav3.3 are detected in IL-6 stimulated cells. Real time PCR analysis of IL-6 stimulated cells indicates no significant change in Cav3.2 mRNA expression in comparison to non-stimulated cells. LNCaP cells stimulated with IL-6 show a threefold increase in T-type Ca(2+) channel subunit Cav3.2 protein expression, suggesting that channel expression is upregulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that increased Cav3.2 protein expression following IL-6 stimulation of LNCaP cells does not result in increased expression of functional channels in the membrane. Functional expression of Cav3.2 channels in LNCaP cells is facilitated by co-stimulation with IL-6 and the cAMP-stimulating agent, forskolin (FSK). Inhibition of T-type Ca(2+) channel activity in IL-6 stimulated LNCaP cells prevents the development of morphological characteristics consistent with NED.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that the functional expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels is regulated by the interplay of multiple factors in LNCaP cells.""","""['Erika M Weaver', 'Francis J Zamora', 'Jennifer L Hearne', 'Miguel Martin-Caraballo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Androgen receptor signaling regulates T-type Ca2+ channel expression and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Functional upregulation of the H2S/Cav3.2 channel pathway accelerates secretory function in neuroendocrine-differentiated human prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of T-type calcium channel expression by sodium butyrate in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of the T-type Ca(2+) channel Cav3.2 by hydrogen sulfide: emerging controversies concerning the role of H2 S in nociception.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: a mechanism of radioresistance and treatment failure.', 'Secretion of Interleukin 6 in Human Skeletal Muscle Cultures Depends on Ca2+ Signalling.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Oncofetal protein glypican-3 is a biomarker and critical regulator of function for neuroendocrine cells in prostate cancer.', 'Ion Channel Profiling in Prostate Cancer: Toward Cell Population-Specific Screening.', 'Role of Calcium Signaling in Prostate Cancer Progression: Effects on Cancer Hallmarks and Bone Metastatic Mechanisms.']"""

Here we show that hypoxia-responsive miR-182 is regulated by HIF1α at transcriptional level. Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH1), negative regulators of HIF1 signaling, are direct targets of miR-182. Overexpression of miR-182 in prostate cancer cells led to a reduction of PHD2 and FIH1 expression and an increase in HIF1α level either under normoxic or hypoxic condition. Consistently, inhibition of miR-182 could increase PHD2 and FIH1 levels, thereby reducing the hypoxia-induced HIF1α expression. Matrigel plug assay showed that angiogenesis was increased by miR-182 overexpression, and vice versa. miR-182 overexpression in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts decreased PHD2 and FIH1 expression, elevated HIF1α protein levels, and increased tumor size. Lastly, we revealed that the levels of both miR-182 and HIF1α were elevated, while the expression PHD2 and FIH1 was downregulated in a mouse model of prostate cancer.

Herein, we investigate the expression and function of Daxx in OSCC.  Materials and methods:   RT-quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluation of the expression of Daxx in human OSCC cell lines and clinical surgical specimens. Short hairpin RNA targeting Daxx was transduced by lentivirus infection to knockdown the expression of Daxx in SAS and SCC25 cell lines, and the influence of this knockdown was evaluated by analyzing the growth and the cell cycle in transduced cells. Immunoprecipitation and sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR were used to analyze the associations between Daxx, TCF4, and cyclin D1 promoter. Xenograft tumor model was used to evaluate the in vivo tumorigenicity of Daxx in OSCC.  Results:   Daxx mRNA and protein expression are elevated in several OSCC cell lines and human OSCC samples in comparison to those in normal tissue. We further find that depletion of Daxx decreases OSCC cell growth activity through G1 cell cycle arrest. Daxx silencing reduces cyclin D1 expression via a Daxx-TCF4 interaction, whereas the Daxx depletion-mediated G1 arrest can be relieved by ectopic expression of cyclin D1. Moreover, we show that in OSCC clinical samples, the expression of Daxx is significantly correlated with that of cyclin D1.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrate the importance of Daxx in regulation of cyclin D1 expression and provide the first evidence that Daxx exhibits tumor-promoting activity in OSCC.

Methods:   Manual rectal contours were obtained for kilovoltage and daily megavoltage CT scans for 10 participants from the VoxTox study (380 scans). Daily delivered dose recalculation was performed using a ray-tracing algorithm. Delivered DVHs were summated to create accumulated DVHs. The rectum was considered as a cylinder, cut and unfolded to produce daily delivered DSMs; these were summated to produce accumulated DSMs.  Results:   Accumulated dose-volumes were different from planned in all participants.

For each of these four participants, ≥1% of pixels on the accumulated DSM received ≥5 Gy more than had been planned.  Conclusion:   Differences between accumulated and planned dose-volumes were seen in all participants. DSMs were able to identify differences between DA and planned dose that could not be appreciated from the DVHs. Further work is needed to extract the dose data embedded in the DSMs. These will be correlated with toxicity as part of the VoxTox Programme.

Defining the role of MSCs in tumorigenesis is crucial for their safe utilization in regenerative medicine. Herein, we conducted comprehensive investigation of the cross-talk between human MSCs (hMSCs) and 12 cancer cell lines derived from breast, prostate, colon, head/neck and skin.  Methods:   Human bone marrow-derived MSC line expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) (hMSC-GFP) were co-cultured with the following cancer cell lines: (MCF7, BT-20, BT-474, MDA-MB-468, T-47D, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, HT-29, MDA-MB-435s, and FaDu) and changes in their morphology were assessed using fluorescent microscopy. For cellular tracking, cells were labeled with Vybrant DiO, DiL, and DiD lipophilic dyes. Time-lapse microscopy was conducted using Nikon BioStation IM-Q. Stable expression of mCherry, and luciferase genes was achieved using lentiviral technology. IL1-Beta neutralizing experiments were conducted using soluble recombinant IL-1R (srIL-1R). Changes in gene expression in sorted hMSCs were assessed using Agilent microarray platform while data normalization and bioinformatics were conducted using GeneSpring software.  Results:   We observed a dynamic interaction between cancer cells and hMSCs. High CDH1 (E-cadherin) and low IL1-Beta expression by cancer cells promoted reorganization of hMSCs into a niche-like formation, which was dependent on direct cell-cell contact. Our data also revealed transfer of cellular components between cancer cells and hMSCs as one possible mechanism for intercellular communication. Global gene expression analysis of sorted hMSCs following co-culturing with MCF7 and BT-20 cells revealed enrichment in signaling pathways related to bone formation, FAK and MAPKK signaling. Co-culturing hMSCs with MCF7 cells increased their growth evidenced by increase in Ki67 and PCNA staining in tumor cells in direct contact with hMSCs niche. On the other hand, co-culturing hMSCs with FaDu, HT-29 or MDA-MB-231 cells led remarkable decline in their cell growth.  Conclusions:   Dynamic interaction exists between hMSCs and cancer cells. CDH1 and IL1-Beta expression by cancer cells mediates the crosstalk between hMSCs and cancer cells.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of T2-weighted imaging and an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map in the detection of anterior prostate cancer and to compare that with the diagnostic performance in the detection of posterior prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 87 patients who underwent 3-T MRI that included T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging before radical prostatectomy. The prostate gland was divided into anterior and posterior segments, and the radiologists interpreted two protocols (T2-weighted imaging alone vs T2-weighted imaging and an ADC map) and sorted the confidence levels for the presence of prostate cancer into five grades. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each protocol for the detection of anterior and posterior prostate cancers. We also assessed the relative fractions of sensitivity and specificity between anterior and posterior prostate cancers. Additionally, the ADCs of noncancerous anterior fibromuscular stroma were measured and compared with the ADCs of anterior prostate cancers.  Results:   The AUCs with T2-weighted imaging alone and with T2-weighted imaging and an ADC map were 0.75 and 0.88 for anterior prostate cancer, respectively, and were 0.70 and 0.81 for posterior prostate cancer.

The purpose of this study was to report the 6-month follow-up oncologic and functional data of the initial phase 1 trial of patients treated with focal transrectal MRI-guided focused ultrasound in North America.  Subjects and methods:   Four patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 ng/mL or less, tumor classification cT2a or less, and a Gleason score of 6 (3 + 3) were prospectively enrolled in the study and underwent multiparametric MRI and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate systematic biopsy. Under MRI guidance and real-time monitoring with MR thermography, focused high-frequency ultrasound energy was delivered to ablate the target tissue. The incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events were recorded along with responses to serial quality-of-life questionnaires for 6 months after treatment. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated with multiparametric MRI and repeat transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy 6 months after treatment.  Results:   Four patients with a total of six target lesions were treated and had complications graded Clavien-Dindo I or less. Quality-of-life parameters were similar between baseline and 6-months. All four patients had normal MRI findings in the treated regions (100%), biopsy showed that three patients (75%) were clear of disease in the treated regions, representing complete ablation of five target lesions (83%). All patients had at least one Gleason 6-positive core outside of the treated zone.

Materials and methods:   The study included 27 patients with prostate cancer (mean [± SD] age, 60.0 ± 7.6 years) who had 3-T endorectal coil MRI of the prostate performed before undergoing prostatectomy with whole-mount histopathologic assessment. Mean ADC values were recorded from the ROI within the index tumor and within benign CZ, PZ, and TZ, with the use of histopathologic findings as the reference standard. ADC values of the groups were compared using paired t tests and ROC curve analysis.  Results:   The ADC of benign CZ in the right (1138 ± 123 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) and left (1166 ± 141 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) lobes was not significantly different (p = 0.217).

In this study we introduced a method to evaluate robustness of proton therapy with respect to inter-fractional motion and applied it to irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) from different beam angles. Patient- versus population-specific patterns in dose deterioration were explored.  Material and methods:   Patient data sets consisting of a planning computed tomography (pCT) as well as multiple repeat CT (rCT) scans for three patients were used, with target volumes and organs at risk (ORs) outlined in all scans. Single beam spot scanning proton plans were optimized for the left and right LN targets separately, across all possible beam angle configurations (5° angle intervals). Isotropic margins of 0, 3, 5 and 7 mm from the clinical target volume (CTV) to the planning target volume (PTV) were investigated. The optimized fluence maps for the pCT for each beam were applied onto all rCTs and the dose distributions were re-calculated. WEPL variation for each beam angle was computed by averaging over beams eye view WEPL distributions.  Results:   Similarity in deterioration patterns were found for the investigated patients, with beam angles delivering less dose to rectum, bladder and overall normal tissue identified around 40° and around 150°-160° for the left LNs, and corresponding angles for the right LNs. These angles were also associated with low values of WEPL variation.  Conclusion:   We have established and explored a method to quantify the robustness towards inter-fractional motion of single beam proton plans treating the pelvic LNs from different beam configurations and with different CTV to PTV margins. For the patients investigated we were able to identify beam orientations that were robust to dose deterioration in the target and ORs.""","""['Andreas G Andersen', 'Oscar Casares-Magaz', 'Ludvig P Muren', 'Jakob Toftegaard', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Sara Thörnqvist', 'Jørgen B B Petersen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Beam angle evaluation to improve inter-fraction motion robustness in pelvic lymph node irradiation with proton therapy.', 'A method for selection of beam angles robust to intra-fractional motion in proton therapy of lung cancer.', 'Degradation of target coverage due to inter-fraction motion during intensity-modulated proton therapy of prostate and elective targets.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Concepts of PTV and Robustness in Passively Scattered and Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy.', 'Proton therapy planning and image-guidance strategies within a randomized controlled trial for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'On-line dose-guidance to account for inter-fractional motion during proton therapy.', 'A biological modelling based comparison of radiotherapy plan robustness using photons vs protons for focal prostate boosting.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine the induced prostate displacement during such TAUS imaging. The prostate displacement was monitored using a novel transperineal four-dimensional (4D) US (TPUS) system.  Material and methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients, with a mean age of 68 years (58/76), were US scanned in the computed tomography (CT) room utilizing the Clarity 4D TPUS monitoring system. The patients were asked to comply with a moderate bladder filling protocol. After US-CT fusion, the prostate volume was delineated and used as a reference for weekly US imaging in the treatment room. Immediately after treatment delivery the TPUS monitoring system was set up. During real-time monitoring of the prostate, a conventional 2D probe was applied to simulate a TAUS scan. The time dependent prostate displacements induced by the 2D probe pressure were recorded for the three orthogonal directions. In total 42 monitoring curves with applied 2D probe were recorded.  Results:   Data analysis of 42 US scans resulted in pressure induced prostate displacements with mean values (± 1 SD) (mm); inferior (+)-superior (I/S): (-0.1 ± 0.8); left (+)-right (L/R): (0.2 ± 0.7); and anterior (+)-posterior (A/P): (-0.1 ± 1.0). The majority of the displacements were within 1-2 mm. Only two scans (5%) (A/P direction) and 16% of Euclidean distances were larger than 2.0 mm. The largest displacement was 2.6 mm in the anterior direction.  Conclusion:   The novel 4D TPUS system was capable of tracking and recording the prostate positional displacements.

NDRG1 expression in cancer cells is generally low, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) in gene promoter was able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes, disordering cell proliferation and apoptosis, playing a promotion role in tumor occurrence and progression. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of epigenetic modification of NDRG1 on prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The protein expression in human specimens was measured by immunohistochemical staining. The expression level of NDRG1 was changed by plasmid vectors in PCa cells. These cells were used to study proliferation and invasiveness. NDRG1 expression in normal prostate cells was higher than that in PCa cells. Downregulation of NDRG1 expression enhanced cell proliferation and invasiveness. In contrast, its upregulation could reduce cell proliferation and invasiveness. In PCa cells, the methylation rate of CGIs in the promoter region of NDRG1 was higher than that in normal prostate cells. 5-Aza-CdR, a methylation inhibitor, was able to effectively reverse the aberrant methylation of NDRG1, enhancing its expression, inhibiting cell growth. NDRG1 can inhibit the cell proliferation and invasion of PCa, but its expression level is low. The aberrant methylation of NDRG1 promoter is an important mechanism for gene silencing, playing an important role in tumor occurrence and progression.

We sought to describe patients' questions when faced with cancer prevention and screening decisions, and to explore differences in question-asking as a function of health literacy with respect to spoken information (health literacy-listening).  Methods:   Four-hundred and thirty-three (433) adults listened to simulated physician-patient interactions discussing (i) prophylactic tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention, (ii) PSA testing for prostate cancer and (iii) colorectal cancer screening, and identified questions they would have. Health literacy-listening was assessed using the Cancer Message Literacy Test-Listening (CMLT-Listening). Two authors developed a coding scheme, which was applied to all questions. Analyses examined whether participants scoring above or below the median on the CMLT-Listening asked a similar variety of questions.  Results:   Questions were coded into six major function categories: risks/benefits, procedure details, personalizing information, additional information, decision making and credibility. Participants who scored higher on the CMLT-Listening asked a greater variety of risks/benefits questions; those who scored lower asked a greater variety of questions seeking to personalize information.

Patients may try to regain control through dietary change aimed at preventing progression and/or recurrence. Evidence for the effectiveness of post-diagnostic dietary change in prostate cancer is not conclusive, which can cause uncertainty among patients and health professionals. This qualitative study explored how eight men in the U.K., who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the previous 5 years, accounted for any post-diagnostic changes they made to their diet. Data were generated through semi-structured telephone interviews and were subjected to thematic analysis. This yielded two themes concerning the perceived nature and importance of dietary change and the perceived determinants of dietary change. The latter focused on internal dimensions such as agency and external dimensions such as the perceived role of relationships with health professionals, the availability of credible dietary information and family influences. The study points to the importance of the family context in enabling the men to implement dietary change. It is suggested that, even if health professionals can only offer qualified, general advice about diet, this may provide men with a focus for action and a means of regaining control.""","""['A P Kassianos', 'A Coyle', 'M M Raats']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Acceptability of dietary and physical activity lifestyle modification for men following radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative investigation.', 'The provision of dietary and physical activity advice for men diagnosed with prostate cancer: a qualitative study of the experiences and views of health care professionals, patients and partners.', 'Barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle and acceptability of a dietary and physical activity intervention among African Caribbean prostate cancer survivors in the UK: a qualitative study.', ""Men, food, and prostate cancer: gender influences on men's diets."", 'Diet and dietary supplement intervention trials for the prevention of prostate cancer recurrence: a review of the randomized controlled trial evidence.', 'Psychosocial Determinants of Lifestyle Change after a Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'The provision of nutritional advice and care for cancer patients: a UK national survey of healthcare professionals.', 'Stable, fragile and recreated - a qualitative study of agency in everyday life with breast and prostate cancer.', 'The feasibility of the Prostate cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial (PrEvENT) dietary and physical activity modifications: a qualitative study.']"""

Integrating information from different, but related, 'transcriptomic' data may help build better classification models. However, most proposed methods for integrative analysis of 'transcriptomic' data cannot incorporate domain knowledge, which can improve model performance. To this end, we have developed a methodology that leverages transfer rule learning and functional modules, which we call TRL-FM, to capture and abstract domain knowledge in the form of classification rules to facilitate integrative modeling of multiple gene expression data. TRL-FM is an extension of the transfer rule learner (TRL) that we developed previously. The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that ""an integrative model obtained via the TRL-FM approach outperforms traditional models based on single gene expression data sources"".  Results:   To evaluate the feasibility of the TRL-FM framework, we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of models developed with TRL-FM and other traditional methods, using 21 microarray datasets generated from three studies on brain cancer, prostate cancer, and lung disease, respectively. The results show that TRL-FM statistically significantly outperforms TRL as well as traditional models based on single source data. In addition, TRL-FM performed better than other integrative models driven by meta-analysis and cross-platform data merging.  Conclusions:   The capability of utilizing transferred abstract knowledge derived from source data using feature mapping enables the TRL-FM framework to mimic the human process of learning and adaptation when performing related tasks. The novel TRL-FM methodology for integrative modeling for multiple 'transcriptomic' datasets is able to intelligently incorporate domain knowledge that traditional methods might disregard, to boost predictive power and generalization performance. In this study, TRL-FM's abstraction of knowledge is achieved in the form of functional modules, but the overall framework is generalizable in that different approaches of acquiring abstract knowledge can be integrated into this framework.""","""['Henry A Ogoe', 'Shyam Visweswaran', 'Xinghua Lu', 'Vanathi Gopalakrishnan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['CARSVM: a class association rule-based classification framework and its application to gene expression data.', 'Integrating gene set analysis and nonlinear predictive modeling of disease phenotypes using a Bayesian multitask formulation.', 'Integrative multi-platform meta-analysis of gene expression profiles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients for identifying novel diagnostic biomarkers.', 'LEMRG: Decision Rule Generation Algorithm for Mining MicroRNA Expression Data.', 'Integrative modeling of the cell.', 'Analysis of the Nosema Cells Identification for Microscopic Images.', 'Application of Taxonomic Modeling to Microbiota Data Mining for Detection of Helminth Infection in Global Populations.', 'The parameter sensitivity of random forests.']"""

To define the impact of typical servings of commercially available tomato products on resultant plasma and prostate lycopene concentrations, men scheduled to undergo prostatectomy (n 33) were randomised either to a lycopene-restricted control group ( < 5 mg lycopene/d) or to a tomato soup (2-2¾ cups prepared/d), tomato sauce (142-198 g/d or 5-7 ounces/d) or vegetable juice (325-488 ml/d or 11-16·5 fluid ounces/d) intervention providing 25-35 mg lycopene/d. Plasma and prostate carotenoid concentrations were measured by HPLC. Tomato soup, sauce and juice consumption significantly increased plasma lycopene concentration from 0·68 (sem 0·1) to 1·13 (sem 0·09) μmol/l (66 %), 0·48 (sem 0·09) to 0·82 (sem 0·12) μmol/l (71 %) and 0·49 (sem 0·12) to 0·78 (sem 0·1) μmol/l (59 %), respectively, while the controls consuming the lycopene-restricted diet showed a decline in plasma lycopene concentration from 0·55 (sem 0·60) to 0·42 (sem 0·07) μmol/l ( - 24 %). The end-of-study prostate lycopene concentration was 0·16 (sem 0·02) nmol/g in the controls, but was 3·5-, 3·6- and 2·2-fold higher in tomato soup (P= 0·001), sauce (P= 0·001) and juice (P= 0·165) consumers, respectively. Prostate lycopene concentration was moderately correlated with post-intervention plasma lycopene concentrations (r 0·60, P =0·001), indicating that additional factors have an impact on tissue concentrations. While the primary geometric lycopene isomer in tomato products was all-trans (80-90 %), plasma and prostate isomers were 47 and 80 % cis, respectively, demonstrating a shift towards cis accumulation.

In the current study we analyzed prevalence and prognostic impact of the de-SUMOylation enzyme SENP1 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   SENP1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing more than 12,400 prostate cancer specimens. Results were compared to tumor phenotype, ERG status, genomic deletions of 3p, 5q, 6q and PTEN, and biochemical recurrence.  Results:   SENP1 immunostaining was detectable in 34.5 % of 9,516 interpretable cancers and considered strong in 7.3 %, moderate in 14.9 % and weak in 12.3 % of cases. Strong SENP1 expression was linked to advanced pT stage (p < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (p < 0.0001), positive lymph node status (p = 0.0019), high pre-operative PSA levels (p = 0.0037), and PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). SENP1 expression was strongly associated with positive ERG fusion status as determined by both in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry as well as with PTEN deletions. Detectable SENP1 immunostaining was found in 41 % of ERG positive and in 47 % of PTEN deleted cancers but in only 30 % of ERG negative and 30 % of PTEN non-deleted cancers (p < 0.0001 each). Deletions of 3p, 5q, and 6q were unrelated to SENP1 expression. Subset analyses revealed that the prognostic impact of SENP1 expression was solely driven by the subgroup of ERG positive, PTEN undeleted cancers. In this subgroup, the prognostic role of SENP1 expression was independent of the preoperative PSA level, tumor stage, Gleason grade, and the status of the resection margin.  Conclusions:   SENP1 expression has strong prognostic impact in a molecularly defined subset of cancers. This is per se not surprising as the biologic impact of each individual molecular event is likely to be dependent on its cellular environment.

Prolactin (PRL) and androgens stimulate CPD gene transcription and expression, which increases intracellular production of NO to promote viability of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro. The current study evaluated whether hormonal upregulation of CPD and NO promote PCa cell viabilty in vivo, by correlating changes in expression of CPD and nitrotyrosine residues (products of NO action) with proliferation marker Ki67 and associated proteins during PCa development and progression.  Methods:   Fresh prostate tissues, obtained from 40 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or PCa, were flash-frozen at the time of surgery and used for RT-qPCR analysis of CPD, androgen receptor (AR), PRL receptor (PRLR), eNOS, and Ki67 levels. Archival paraffin-embedded tissues from 113 men with BPH or PCa were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of CPD, nitrotyrosines, phospho-Stat5 (for activated PRLR), AR, eNOS/iNOS, and Ki67.  Results:   RT-qPCR and IHC analyses showed strong AR and PRLR expression in benign and malignant prostates. CPD mRNA levels increased ∼threefold in PCa compared to BPH, which corresponded to a twofold increase in Ki67 mRNA levels. IHC analysis showed a progressive increase in CPD from 11.4 ± 2.1% in benign to 21.8 ± 3.2% in low-grade (P = 0.007), 40.7 ± 4.0% in high-grade (P < 0.0001) and 50.0 ± 9.5% in castration-recurrent PCa (P < 0.0001). Immunostaining for nitrotyrosines and Ki67 mirrored these increases during PCa progression. CPD, nitrotyrosines, and Ki67 tended to co-localize, as did phospho-Stat5.  Conclusions:   CPD, nitrotyrosine, and Ki67 levels were higher in PCa than in benign and tended to co-localize, along with phospho-Stat5. The strong correlation in expression of these proteins in benign and malignant prostate tissues, combined with abundant AR and PRLR, supports in vitro evidence that the CPD-Arg-NO pathway is involved in the regulation of PCa cell proliferation.

Animal and in-vitro prostate cancer (PCa) models have demonstrated decreased tumor growth with metformin, however the precise mechanisms are unknown. We examine the effects of metformin on PCa biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a large clinical database followed by evaluating metabolic signaling changes in a cohort of men undergoing prostate needle biopsy (PNB).  Methods:   Men treated for localized PCa were identified in a comprehensive clinical database between 2001 and 2010. Cox regression was performed to determine association with BCR relative to metformin use. We next identified a separate case-control cohort of men undergoing prostate needle biopsy (PNB) stratified by metformin use. Differences in mean IHC scores were compared with linear regression for phosphorylated IR, IGF-IR, AKT, and AMPK.  Results:   One thousand seven hundred and thirty four men were evaluated for BCR with mean follow up of 41 months (range 1-121 months). ""Ever"" metformin use was not associated with BCR (HR 1.12, 0.77-1.65), however men reporting both pre/post-treatment metformin use had a 45% reduction in BCR (HR = 0.55 (0.31-0.96)). For the tissue-based study, 48 metformin users and 42 controls underwent PNB. Significantly greater staining in phosphorylated nuclear (p-IR, p-AKT) and cytoplasmic (p-IR, p-IGF-1R) insulin signaling proteins were seen in patients with PCa detected compared to those with negative PNB (P-values all <0.006). When stratified by metformin use, IGF-1R remained significantly elevated (P = 0.01) in men with PCa detected whereas p-AMPK (P = 0.05) was elevated only in those without PCa.  Conclusion:   Metformin use is associated with reduced BCR after treatment of localized PCa when considering pre-diagnostic and cumulative dosing. In men with cancer detected on PNB, insulin signaling markers were significantly elevated compared to negative PNB patients. The finding of IGF-1R elevation in positive PNBs versus p-AMPK elevation in negative PNBs suggests altered metabolic pathway activation precipitated by metformin use.""","""['Brian Winters', 'Stephen Plymate', 'Steven B Zeliadt', 'Sarah Holt', 'Xiaotun Zhang', 'Elaine Hu', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Bryan Wooldridge', 'John L Gore', 'Michael P Porter', 'Jonathan L Wright']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Investigating the role of the IGF axis as a predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients post-surgery.', 'Antidiabetic drug use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Statins are Associated With Increased Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in Diabetic Men but no Association was Seen in Men also Taking Metformin: Results From the SEARCH Database.', 'The anticancer potential of metformin on prostate cancer.', 'Combination Therapies Using Metformin and/or Valproic Acid in Prostate Cancer: Possible Mechanistic Interactions.', 'Statin and metformin use and outcomes in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide: A meta-analysis of AFFIRM, PREVAIL and PROSPER.', 'The Impact of Metformin Use with Survival Outcomes in Urologic Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Randomized trial evaluating the role of weight loss in overweight and obese men with early stage prostate Cancer on active surveillance: Rationale and design of the Prostate Cancer Active Lifestyle Study (PALS).', 'Identification of a novel 2-oxindole fluorinated derivative as in vivo antitumor agent for prostate cancer acting via AMPK activation.', 'Hyperglycaemia-induced resistance to Docetaxel is negated by metformin: a role for IGFBP-2.']"""

Materials and methods:   Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to TP (32) and EP (30) to RARP. Pre-operation data were collected for all patients. Hemodynamic, respiratory and blood acid-base parameters were measured at the moment of induction of anesthesia (T0), after starting CO(2) insufflation (T1), and at 60 (T2) and 120 minutes (T3) after insufflation. In all cases, the abdominal pressure was set at 15 mmHg. Complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Student's two-t-test, with a significance level set at p<0.05, was used to compare categorical values between groups. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the median values of two nonparametric continuous variables.  Results:   The demographic characteristics of the patients in both groups were statistically comparable. Analysis of intra-operative anesthesiologic parameters showed that partial CO(2) pressure during EP was significantly higher than during TP, with a consequent decrease in arterial pH. Other parameters analysed were similar in the two groups. Postoperative complications were comparable between groups. The most important limitations of this study were the small size of the patient groups and the impossibility of maintaining standard abdominal pressure throughout the operational phases, despite attempts to regulate it.

The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of the percentage of positive biopsy cores to predict the chance of extraprostatic cancer.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 1787 patients with localized prostate cancer submitted to radical prostatectomy. The percentage of positive cores in prostate biopsy was correlated with the pathologic outcome of the surgical specimen. In the final analysis, a correlation was made between categorical ranges of positive cores (10% intervals) and the risk of extraprostatic extension and/or bladder neck invasion, seminal vesicles involvement or metastasis to iliac lymph nodes. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   For each 10% of positive cores we observed a progressive higher prevalence of extraprostatic disease. The risk of cancer beyond the prostate capsule for <10% positive biopsy cores was 7.4% and it increased to 76.2% at the category 90-100% positive cores. In patients with Gleason grade 4 or 5, the risk of extraprostatic cancer prostate was higher than in those without any component 4 or 5.

This study aimed to examine the association between the tumor volume estimations based on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy results and the tumor volume measured on the pathological specimen.  Materials and methods:   A total of 237 patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) were included in this retrospective study. The differences and correlations between cancer volume estimations based on TRUS guided biopsy findings and cancer volume estimations based on post-prostatectomy pathology specimens were examined. In addition, diagnostic value of TRUS guided biopsy-based volume estimations in order to predict clinically significant cancer (>0.5 cc) were calculated.  Results:   The mean cancer volume estimated using TRUS biopsy results was lower (5.5±6.5 cc) than the mean cancer volume calculated using prostatectomy specimens (6.4±7.6 cc) (p<0.041).TRUS guided biopsy examination resulted in 5 false positive and 15 false negative cases. There was a significant but weak correlation between the two parameters (r=0.62, p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of TRUS guided biopsy in predicting the presence of clinically significant cancer was 93.4% (95% CI, 89.1-96.1) and 50.0% (95% CI, 20.1-79.9), respectively.

HDR brachytherapy monotherapy doses consisted of two 1,350-1,400 cGy fractions separated by 2-3 weeks, and HDR brachytherapy boost doses consisted of two 950-1,150 cGy fractions separated by 4 weeks. Twelve of 32 (38%) unfavorable intermediate risk, high risk, and very high risk patients received androgen deprivation therapy. Acute toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.  Results:   Median follow-up was 14 months.

We were able to show that PESIN-based peptide multimers can result in substantially higher GRPR avidities, highly advantageous in vivo pharmacokinetics and tumor imaging properties compared to the respective monomers. However, the minimal distance between the peptidic binders, resulting in the lowest possible system entropy while enabling a concomitant GRPR binding and thus optimized receptor avidities, has not been determined so far. Thus, we aimed here to identify the minimal distance between two GRPR-binding peptides in order to provide the basis for the development of highly avid GRPR-specific PET imaging agents. We therefore synthesized dimers of the GRPR-binding bombesin analogue BBN(7-14) on a dendritic scaffold, exhibiting different distances between both peptide binders. The homodimers were further modified with the chelator NODAGA, radiolabeled with (68)Ga, and evaluated in vitro regarding their GRPR avidity. We found that the most potent of the newly developed radioligands exhibits GRPR avidity twice as high as the most potent reference compound known so far, and that a minimal distance of 62 bond lengths between both peptidic binders within the homodimer can result in concomitant peptide binding and optimal GRPR avidities. These findings answer the question as to what molecular design should be chosen when aiming at the development of highly avid homobivalent peptidic ligands addressing the GRPR.""","""['G Fischer', 'S Lindner', 'S Litau', 'R Schirrmacher', 'B Wängler', 'C Wängler']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['PESIN multimerization improves receptor avidities and in vivo tumor targeting properties to GRPR-overexpressing tumors.', 'A new (68)Ga-labeled BBN peptide with a hydrophilic linker for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', 'N-terminal modifications improve the receptor affinity and pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled peptidic gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonists: examples of 68Ga- and 64Cu-labeled peptides for PET imaging.', 'Radiolabeled peptide conjugates for targeting of the bombesin receptor superfamily subtypes.', 'An update of radiolabeled bombesin analogs for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeting.', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent SiFAlin-Modified Peptidic Radioligands Targeting Both Integrin αvβ3 and the MC1 Receptor-Suitable for the Specific Visualization of Melanomas?', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Hybrid Multimodal Imaging Synthons for Chemoselective and Efficient Biomolecule Modification with Chelator and Near-Infrared Fluorescent Cyanine Dye.', 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Functional Hybrid Molecules for the Visualization of Cancer: PESIN-Homodimers Combined with Multimodal Molecular Imaging Probes for Positron Emission Tomography and Optical Imaging: Suited for Tracking of GRPR-Positive Malignant Tissue*.']"""

The cost of providing care to this group as they approach the end of their lives is unknown, but represents a significant cost to health and social care systems, charities patients and their families.  Aim:   In this study, we estimate the direct and indirect costs for lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients at the end of life (from the start of strong opioids to death) in England and Wales.  Methods:   We use a modelling-based approach to estimate the costs of care. Data are estimated from the literature and publicly available data sets. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to reflect uncertainty in model estimates.  Results:   Total estimated costs for treating people with these four cancers at the end of life are £ 641 million. Breast and prostate cancer patients have the highest expected cost per person at £ 12,663 (95% credible interval (CI): £ 1249-£ 38,712) and £ 14,859 (95% CI: £ 1391-£ 46,424), respectively. Lung cancer has the highest expected total cost (£ 226 m). The value of informal care giving accounts for approximately one-third of all costs.  Conclusion:   The cost to society of providing care to people at the end of their lives is significant. Much of this cost is borne by informal care givers.

In this study we present a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method to quantitate the thickness and elasticity of the rectal wall in prostate cancer patients treated with RT.  Material and methods:   Four patients previously treated with RT for prostate cancer underwent an MRI session with stepwise rectal bag deflation (from a maximum tolerable volume to 0 ml, in 50 ml steps), with a probe inserted inside the bag to monitor the internal rectal pressure. MRIs were acquired using Dixon sequences (4 mm axial slice thickness) at each deflation step. Rectal walls were defined from the recto-sigmoid junction to 3 cm above the anal canal as the space between the inner and outer wall surfaces. The wall thickness was determined and biomechanical properties (strain and stress) were calculated from the pressure measurements and the MRI-segmented rectal walls.  Results:   The integral rectal pressure varied for the maximum tolerable volume (range 150-250 ml) across patients and ranged from 1.3 to 4.0 kPa (SD = 1.2 kPa). Wall thickness was found to vary between patients and also across different rectum segments, with a mean (SD) thickness for the different segments at the 50 ml distension volume of 1.8-4.0 (0.6) mm. Stress showed larger variation than strain, with mean (SD) values for the different segments ranging between 1.5 and 7.0 (1.5) kPa.  Conclusion:   We have developed a method to quantify biomechanical properties of the rectal wall. The resulting rectal wall thickness, strain and stress differed between patients, as well as across different rectal wall sections.

Mechanistically, we identify p19(ARF) as a direct Stat3 target. Loss of Stat3 signalling disrupts the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumour suppressor axis bypassing senescence. Strikingly, we also identify STAT3 and CDKN2A mutations in primary human PCa. STAT3 and CDKN2A deletions co-occurred with high frequency in PCa metastases. In accordance, loss of STAT3 and p14(ARF) expression in patient tumours correlates with increased risk of disease recurrence and metastatic PCa.

Development of novel therapeutic options is critically needed to target advanced forms. Here we demonstrate that combinatorial treatment with the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TZD) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce significant apoptosis in various PCa cells independent of androgen receptor status. Because TZD is known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), we determined whether AMPK is a molecular target mediating this apoptotic cascade by utilizing PCa cell lines stably overexpressing AMPKα1 dominant negative (C4-2-DN) or empty vector (C4-2-EV). Our results indicated a significantly higher degree of apoptosis with TRAIL-TZD combination in C4-2-EV cells compared with C4-2-DN cells. Similarly, results from a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed a larger reduction of viability of C4-2-EV cells compared with C4-2-DN cells when treated with TRAIL-TZD, thus suggesting that C4-2-DN cells were more apoptosis-resistant. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous AMPKα1 expression showed a reduction of TRAIL-TZD-induced apoptosis, further confirming the participation of AMPK in mediating this apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by this combinatorial treatment was also associated with a cleavage of β-catenin that was inhibited in both C4-2-DN cells and those cells in which AMPKα1 was knocked down. In addition, time course studies showed an increase in pACC(S79) (AMPK target) levels coinciding with the time of apoptosis. These studies indicate the involvement of AMPK in TRAIL-TZD-mediated apoptosis and β-catenin cleavage and suggest the possibility of utilizing AMPK as a therapeutic target in apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Sreevidya Santha', 'Navin Viswakarma', 'Subhasis Das', 'Ajay Rana', 'Basabi Rana']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Caspase-mediated cleavage of beta-catenin precedes drug-induced apoptosis in resistant cancer cells.', 'Involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase and Death Receptor 5 in TRAIL-Berberine-induced apoptosis of cancer cells.', 'Modulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β following TRAIL combinatorial treatment in cancer cells.', 'Wnt and SHH in prostate cancer: trouble mongers occupy the TRAIL towards apoptosis.', ""NutriTRAILomics in prostate cancer: time to have two strings to one's bow."", 'Ets1 mediates sorafenib resistance by regulating mitochondrial ROS pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The potent AMPK inhibitor BAY-3827 shows strong efficacy in androgen-dependent prostate cancer models.', 'Mutant Kras as a Biomarker Plays a Favorable Role in FL118-Induced Apoptosis, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production and Modulation of Survivin, Mcl-1 and XIAP in Human Bladder Cancer.', 'Berberine Represses β-Catenin Translation Involving 4E-BPs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Curcumin Recovers Intracellular Lipid Droplet Formation Through Increasing Perilipin 5 Gene Expression in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells In Vitro.']"""

Here we use a combination of yeast reporter assays and mammalian systems to provide a more complete understanding of glucagon receptor signaling, considering the effect of multiple ligands, association with the receptor-interacting protein receptor activity-modifying protein-2 (RAMP2), and the role of individual G protein α-subunits. We demonstrate that RAMP2 alters both ligand selectivity and G protein preference of the glucagon receptor. Importantly, we also uncover novel cross-reactivity of therapeutically used GLP-1 receptor ligands at the glucagon receptor that is abolished by RAMP2 interaction.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-nine consecutive men between May 2001 and January 2012 were identified for this analysis. All patients underwent definitive HDR monotherapy for favorable prostate cancer to a total dose of 3150 cGy in three fractions, 3800 cGy in four fractions, or 3850 in five fractions. Patient-reported genitourinary function was assessed before HDR, during an acute period after treatment (within 90 days of HDR), and on long-term followup using the American Urological Association International Prostate Symptom Score, a urinary QOL Likert questionnaire, and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed using the ordinary least squares method.  Results:   With median followup of 57 months, biochemical progression-free survival was 100%. There were no grade ≥3 toxicities. Dose to the urethra and bladder, as well as prostate size and intraprostatic urethra length were predictive for short-term changes in QOL. Advanced patient age was predictive for worse sexual function on both acute and long-term followup.  Conclusions:   Toxicity after HDR monotherapy for prostate cancer is acceptable. Patients with larger prostates, longer intraprostatic urethras, and greater doses to the bladder and urethra may experience worse acute urinary QOL.

Patients and methods:   In all, 115 patients with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer underwent mp-MRI before radical prostatectomy. A single expert radiologist recorded all prostate cancer foci including the index lesion 'blinded' to the pathologist's biopsy report. Stained whole-mount histological sections were used as the reference standard. All lesions were contoured by an experienced uropathologist who assessed their volume and pathological Gleason score. All lesions with a volume of >0.5 mL and/or pathological Gleason score of >6 were defined as clinically significant prostate cancer. Multivariate analysis was used to ascertain the characteristics of lesions identified by MRI.  Results:   In all, 104 of 115 index lesions were correctly diagnosed by mp-MRI (sensitivity 90.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 83.5-95.1%), including 98/105 clinically significant index lesions (93.3%; 95% CI 86.8-97.3%), among which three of three lesions had a volume of <0.5 mL and Gleason score of >6. Overall, mp-MRI detected 131/206 lesions including 13 of 68 'insignificant' prostate cancers. The multivariate logistic regression modelling showed that pathological Gleason score (odds ratio [OR] 11.7, 95% CI 2.3-59.8; P = 0.003) and lesion volume (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.3-14.7; P = 0.022) were independently associated with the detection of index lesions at MRI.  Conclusions:   This study shows that mp-MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer index lesions, while having disappointing results for the detection of small-volume, low Gleason score prostate cancer foci.

We found pro-apoptotic activity of sponge FAU protein. The same as its human homologue, sponge FAU increases apoptosis in human HEK293T cells. This indicates that the biological functions of FAU, usually associated with ""higher"" metazoans, particularly in cancer etiology, possess a biochemical background established early in metazoan evolution. The ancestor of all animals possibly possessed FAU protein with the structure and function similar to evolutionarily more recent versions of the protein, even before the appearance of true tissues and the origin of tumors and metastasis.

Degarelix is a GnRHR antagonist approved for use in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who need androgen deprivation therapy. The slowing of prostate cell growth is a common goal shared by PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and the effect of degarelix on BPH cells has not yet been investigated. We wanted to evaluate the direct effect of degarelix on human BPH primary cell growth. Gene expression studies performed with BPH (n=11), stage 0 (n=15), and PCa (n=65) human specimens demonstrated the presence of GNRHR1 and GNRHR2 and their respective endogenous peptide ligands. BPH-isolated epithelial and stromal cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured (1:4 or 4:1 ratio of epithelial to stromal cells) and subsequently treated with increasing concentrations of degarelix. Degarelix treatment induced a decrease in cell viability and cell proliferation rates, which occurred in parallel to an increase in apoptosis. Both epithelial and stromal BPH cells are sensitive to degarelix treatment and, interestingly, degarelix is also effective when the cells were growing in a co-culture microenvironment. In contrast to degarelix, the GnRHR agonists, leuprolide and goserelin, exerted no effect on the viability of BPH epithelial or stromal cells. In conclusion, (i) prostate tissues express GNRHR and are a potential target for degarelix; and (ii) degarelix directly inhibits BPH cell growth through a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.

Significant synergy of DOX and DAS in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was demonstrated in various types of cancer cells, including breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Co-encapsulation of the two agents was facilitated by incorporation of 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and carboxybenzyl (Cbz) groups into a nanocarrier for effective carrier-drug interactions. Spherical nanomicelles with a small size of ∼30 nm were self-assembled by PLFCL. Strong carrier/drug intermolecular π-π stacking was demonstrated in fluorescence quenching and UV absorption. Fluorescence study showed more effective accumulation of DOX in nuclei of cancer cells following treatment with DOX&DAS/PLFCL in comparison with cells treated with DOX/PLFCL. DOX&DAS/PLFCL micelles were also more effective than other treatments in inhibiting the proliferation and migration of cultured cancer cells. Finally, a superior anti-tumor activity was demonstrated with DOX&DAS/PLFCL. A tumor growth inhibition rate of 95% was achieved at a respective dose of 5 mg/kg for DOX and DAS in a murine breast cancer model. Our nanocarrier may represent a simple and effective system that could facilitate clinical translation of this promising multi-agent regimen in combination chemotherapy.""","""['Peng Zhang', 'Jiang Li', 'Mohammed Ghazwani', 'Wenchen Zhao', 'Yixian Huang', 'Xiaolan Zhang', 'Raman Venkataramanan', 'Song Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Doxorubicin delivered by a redox-responsive dasatinib-containing polymeric prodrug carrier for combination therapy.', 'Lymphoma Immunochemotherapy: Targeted Delivery of Doxorubicin via a Dual Functional Nanocarrier.', 'Mixed polymeric micelles for combination cancer chemotherapy through the concurrent delivery of multiple chemotherapeutic agents.', 'A comprehensive review on alginate-based delivery systems for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agent: Doxorubicin.', 'The Synthesis of Nano-Doxorubicin and its Anticancer Effect.', 'STING agonist-loaded, CD47/PD-L1-targeting nanoparticles potentiate antitumor immunity and radiotherapy for glioblastoma.', 'Micelles as potential drug delivery systems for colorectal cancer treatment.', 'Glutathione-depleting polymer delivering chlorin e6 for enhancing photodynamic therapy.', 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a novel mitomycin nanomicelle delivery system.', 'Nanotechnology of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy: A Perspective.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective case-control study. In 129 PCa patients who underwent ultrasound-guided needle prostate biopsy and subsequent radical prostatectomy from 1987 to 1999 at the University Hospital of Careggi, we evaluated: (1) mRNA expression of the serine 2 (TMPRSS2): erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG); (2) expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9 (epithelial and stromal); (3) expression of androgen receptor; (4) expression of prognostic marker Ki67 (MIB1); (5) presence and typing of human papilloma virus; (6) DNA methylation of CpG islands of several genes involved in PCa progression.  Results:   The cohort consists of 38 cases (patients with PCa and died of PCa within 10 years from diagnosis) and 91 controls (patients with PCa but alive 10 years after diagnosis). Gleason bioptic score, epithelial MMP expression and SERPINB5 methylation correlated with statistically significant increase in death risk OR. Compared with patients with high level of MMP, patients with low level of MMP had OR for specific death 4.78 times higher (p = 0.0066).

Several immune-related adverse events are known. Steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis is an autoimmune encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's Disease and elevated serum levels of the related antibodies (anti-thyroid-peroxidase antibody or anti-thyroglobulin antibody). Our case implies that steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis may be another previously unreported side effect of ipilimumab therapy.  Case presentation:   We report the case of a 64 years old caucasian patient with prostatic cancer who received ipilimumab therapy in a clinical trial. He presented with aphasia, tremor and ataxia, myocloni, hallucinations, anxiety and agitation in turns with somnolence. Cranial nerves, deep tendon reflexes, motor and sensory functions were normal. Electroencephalography showed background slowing but no epileptic discharges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal and showed no signs of hypophysitis. Cerebrospinal fluid findings ruled out infection and neoplastic meningitis. Anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-thyroid-peroxidase antibody and anti-thyroglobulin antibody) were heavily increased. Assuming steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis the patient was treated with 1,000 mg methylprednisolone i.v. for 3 days and continued with 1 mg/kg orally. On the 3rd day of treatment the patient's condition started to improve. Within the next few days he gradually returned to his previous state, and electroencephalography eventually showed only slight slowing. Seven months later the patient's condition was stable, and anti-thyroid antibodies were no more detectable.  Conclusion:   Steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis may be a hitherto unrecognized complication of ipililumab treatment and should be taken into consideration in patients developing central nervous symptoms undergoing this treatment.""","""['David Carl', 'Carsten Grüllich', 'Steffen Hering', 'Martin Schabet']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""[""Hashimoto's Encephalopathy: Case Series and Literature Review."", 'A patient with steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis.', 'Steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) in childhood.', ""Anti-NAE autoantibodies and clinical spectrum in Hashimoto's encephalopathy."", ""Hashimoto's encephalopathy--case report and diagnostic issues in Japan."", 'Molecular and Genetic Immune Biomarkers of Primary and Immune-Therapy Induced Hypophysitis: From Laboratories to the Clinical Practice.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced aseptic meningitis and encephalitis: a case-series and narrative review.', 'Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced endocrinopathies in cancer patients: a scoping review of case reports.', 'Endocrine and metabolic adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors: an overview (what endocrinologists should know).']"""

Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9902 was a randomized trial testing the hypothesis that adjuvant combination chemotherapy (CT) with paclitaxel, estramustine, and oral etoposide plus LT AS plus RT would improve overall survival (OS).  Methods and materials:   Patients with high-risk PCa (prostate-specific antigen 20-100 ng/mL and Gleason score [GS] ≥ 7 or clinical stage ≥ T2 and GS ≥ 8) were randomized to RT and AS (AS + RT) alone or with adjuvant CT (AS + RT + CT). CT was given as four 21-day cycles, delivered beginning 28 days after 70.2 Gy of RT. AS was given as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone for 24 months, beginning 2 months before RT plus an oral antiandrogen for 4 months before and during RT. The study was designed based on a 6% improvement in OS from 79% to 85% at 5 years, with 90% power and a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.  Results:   A total of 397 patients (380 eligible) were randomized. The patients had high-risk PCa, 68% with GS 8 to 10 and 34% T3 to T4 tumors, and median prostate-specific antigen of 22.6 ng/mL. The median follow-up period was 9.2 years. The trial closed early because of excess thromboembolic toxicity in the CT arm. The 10-year results for all randomized patients revealed no significant difference between the AS + RT and AS + RT + CT arms in OS (65% vs 63%; P=.81), biochemical failure (58% vs 54%; P=.82), local progression (11% vs 7%; P=.09), distant metastases (16% vs 14%; P=.42), or disease-free survival (22% vs 26%; P=.61).  Conclusions:   NRG Oncology RTOG 9902 showed no significant differences in OS, biochemical failure, local progression, distant metastases, or disease-free survival with the addition of adjuvant CT to LT AS + RT.

A number of analytic approaches have been proposed to assist research funding decisions, the most prominent of which are value of information (VOI) and prospective payback of research (PPoR). Despite the increasing interest in the topic, there are insufficient VOI and PPoR applications on the same case study to contrast their methods and compare their outcomes. We undertook VOI and PPoR analyses to determine the value of conducting 2 proposed research programs. The application served as a vehicle for identifying differences and similarities between the methods, provided insight into the assumptions and practical requirements of undertaking prospective analyses for research prioritization, and highlighted areas for future research.  Methods:   VOI and PPoR were applied to case studies representing proposals for clinical trials in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Decision models were built to synthesize the evidence available prior to the funding decision. VOI (expected value of perfect and sample information) and PPoR (PATHS model) analyses were undertaken using the developed models.  Results and conclusions:   VOI and PPoR results agreed in direction, suggesting that the proposed trials would be cost-effective investments. However, results differed in magnitude, largely due to the way each method conceptualizes the possible outcomes of further research and the implementation of research results in practice. Compared with VOI, PPoR is less complex but requires more assumptions.

As the prostate bed does not move in a uniform manner, there is a rationale for anisotropic PTV margins with matching to soft tissue. The aim of this study is to find the combination of PTV expansion and image guidance policy for PP-IMRT that provides the best balance of target coverage whilst minimising dose to the organs at risk.  Methods:   The Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images (n = 377) of 40 patients who received PP-IMRT with daily online alignment to bony anatomy (BA) were reviewed. Six different PTV expansions were assessed: 3 published PTV expansions (0.5 cm uniform, 1 cm uniform, and 1 + 0.5 cm posterior) and 3 further anisotropic PTV expansions (Northern Sydney Cancer Centre (NSCC), van Herk, and smaller anisotropic). Each was assessed for size, bladder and rectum coverage and geographic miss. Each CBCT was rematched using a superior soft tissue (SST) and averaged soft tissue (AST) match. Potential geographic miss was assessed using all PTV expansions except the van Herk margin.  Results:   The 0.5 cm uniform expansion yielded the smallest PTV (median volume = 222.3 cc) and the 1 cm uniform expansion yielded the largest (361.7 cc). The Van Herk expansion includes the largest amount of bladder (28.0 %) and rectum (36.0 %) and the 0.5 cm uniform expansion the smallest (17.1 % bladder; 10.2 % rectum). The van Herk PTV expansion had the least geographic miss with BA matching (4.2 %) and the 0.5 cm uniform margin (28.4 %) the greatest. BA matching resulted in the highest geographic miss rate for all PTVs, followed by SST matching and AST matching. Changing from BA to an AST match decreases potential geographic miss by half to two thirds, depending on the PTV expansion, to <10 % for all PTV expansions. When using the smaller anisotropic PTV expansion, AST matching would reduce the geographic miss rate from 21.0 % with BA matching down to 5.6 %.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest the optimal PTV expansion and image guidance policy for PP-IMRT is daily average soft tissue matching using CBCT scans with a small anisotropic PTV expansion of 0.5 cm in all directions apart from a 1 cm expansion in the anterior-posterior direction in the upper prostate bed.

C1orf63 has been reported to be up-regulated in IL-2-starved T lymphocytes, which suggests it might be involved in cell cycle control, a common mechanism for carcinogenesis. Here we investigated the expression and clinical implication of C1orf63 in breast cancer.  Methods:   Paraffin-embedded specimens, clinicopathological features and follow-up data of the breast cancer patients were collected. Publicly available microarray and RNA-seq datasets used in this study were downloaded from ArrayExpress of EBI and GEO of NCBI. KM plotter tool was also adopted. The expression of C1orf63 and CDK10, one known cell cycle-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Western blotting was performed to detect C1orf63 protein in human breast cancer cell lines, purchased from the Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai.  Results:   In a group of 12 human breast tumors and their matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63 expression was observed in 7 of the 12 breast tumors, but not in the 12 adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed of C1orf63 mRNA expression both in breast cancer and several other cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In another group of 182 breast cancer patients, C1orf63 expression in tumors was not correlated with any clinicopathological features collected in this study. Survival analyses showed that there was no significant difference of overall survival (OS) rates between the C1orf63 (+) group and the C1orf63 (-) group (P = 0.145). However, the analyses of KM plotter displayed a valid relationship between C1orf63 and RFS (relapse free survival)/OS (P < 0.001; P = 0.007). Notablely, in breast cancers with advanced TNM stages (III ~ IV) among these 182 patients, C1orf63 expression was an independent prognostic factor predicting better clinical outcome (HR: 0.41; 95 % CI: 0.17 ~ 0.97; P = 0.042). Additionally, we found that CDK10 mRNA expression was positively correlated with C1orf63, which was consistent with the relationship of protein expression between C1orf63 and CDK10 (r s = 0.391; P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63 expression was elevated in tumor tissues. However, C1orf63 predicts better prognosis for breast cancers with advanced TNM stage, and the underlying mechanism is unknown.

Since the majority of variants found in an individual are thought to be common within the population, we constructed a set of 931 samples from healthy, unrelated individuals, originating from two different sequencing platforms, to serve as a virtual normal (VN) in the absence of such an associated normal sample. Our approach removed (1) >96% of the germline variants also removed by the MN sample and (2) a large number (2%-8%) of additional variants not corrected for by the associated normal. The combination of the VN with the MN improved the correction for polymorphisms significantly, with up to ∼30% compared with MN and ∼15% compared with VN only. We determined the number of unrelated genomes needed in order to correct at least as efficiently as the MN is about 200 for structural variations (SVs) and about 400 for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. In addition, we propose that the removal of common variants with purely position-based methods is inaccurate and incurs additional false-positive somatic variants, and more sophisticated algorithms, which are capable of leveraging information about the area surrounding variants, are needed for optimal accuracy.

CD147 specificity and expression were confirmed with immunoblotting of prostate cell lines, and CD147 mRNA expression was evaluated in public expression microarray datasets of patient prostate tumors.  Results:   Expression of CD147 protein was significantly decreased in localized tumors (pT2; p = 0.02) and aggressive PCa (≥pT3; p = 0.004), and metastases (p = 0.001) compared to benign prostatic tissue. Decreased CD147 was associated with advanced pathologic stage (p = 0.009) and high Gleason score (p = 0.02), and low CD147 expression predicted biochemical recurrence (HR 0.55; 95 % CI 0.31-0.97; p = 0.04) independent of clinico-pathologic features. Immunoblot bands were detected at 44 kDa and 66 kDa, representing non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of CD147 protein, and CD147 expression was lower in tumorigenic T10 cells than non-tumorigenic BPH-1 cells (p = 0.02). Decreased CD147 mRNA expression was associated with increased Gleason score and pathologic stage in patient tumors but is not associated with recurrence status.  Conclusions:   Membrane-associated CD147 expression is significantly decreased in PCa compared to non-malignant prostate tissue and is associated with tumor progression, and low CD147 expression predicts biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy independent of pathologic stage, Gleason score, lymph node status, surgical margins, and tumor volume in multivariable analysis.""","""['Tyler M Bauman', 'Jonathan A Ewald', 'Wei Huang', 'William A Ricke']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Reduced CD147 expression is linked to ERG fusion-positive prostate cancers but lacks substantial impact on PSA recurrence in patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Upregulation of Talin-1 expression associates with advanced pathological features and predicts lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'SIGIRR/TIR8, an important regulator of TLR4 and IL-1R-mediated NF-κB activation, predicts biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in low-grade prostate carcinomas.', 'Importance of N-glycosylation on CD147 for its biological functions.', 'The biological function and clinical utilization of CD147 in human diseases: a review of the current scientific literature.', 'Identification of ADAM12 as a Novel Basigin Sheddase.', 'CD147 as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis.', 'CD147 and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The role of CD147 expression in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Quantitation of Protein Expression and Co-localization Using Multiplexed Immuno-histochemical Staining and Multispectral Imaging.']"""

To test the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor maspin may reduce microenvironment-dependent prostate tumor cell plasticity and thereby modulate drug sensitivity, we established a new schematic combination of two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and suspension cultures to enrich prostate cancer cell subpopulations with distinct differentiation potentials. We report here that depending on the level of maspin expression, tumor cells in suspension and 3D collagen I manifest the phenotypes of stem-like and dormant tumor cell populations, respectively. In suspension, the surviving maspin-expressing tumor cells lost the self-renewal capacity, underwent senescence, lost the ability to dedifferentiate in vitro, and failed to generate tumors in vivo. Maspin-nonexpressing tumor cells that survived the suspension culture in compact tumorspheres displayed a higher level of stem cell marker expression, maintained the self-renewal capacity, formed tumorspheres in 3D matrices in vitro, and were tumorigenic in vivo. The drug sensitivities of the distinct cell subpopulations depend on the drug target and the differentiation state of the cells. In 2D, docetaxel, MS275, and salinomycin were all cytotoxic. In suspension, while MS275 and salinomycin were toxic, docetaxel showed no effect. Interestingly, cells adapted to 3D collagen I were only responsive to salinomycin. Maspin expression correlated with higher sensitivity to MS275 in both 2D and suspension and to salinomycin in 2D and 3D collagen I. Our data suggest that maspin reduces prostate tumor cell plasticity and enhances tumor sensitivity to salinomycin, which may hold promise in overcoming tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity.""","""['M Margarida Bernardo', 'Alexander Kaplun', 'Sijana H Dzinic', 'Xiaohua Li', 'Jonathan Irish', 'Adelina Mujagic', 'Benjamin Jakupovic', 'Jessica B Back', 'Eric Van Buren', 'Xiang Han', 'Ivory Dean', 'Yong Q Chen', 'Elisabeth Heath', 'Wael Sakr', 'Shijie Sheng']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Maspin expression inhibits osteolysis, tumor growth, and angiogenesis in a model of prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Tackling tumor heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in cancer precision medicine: our experience and a literature review.', 'Tumorspheres derived from prostate cancer cells possess chemoresistant and cancer stem cell properties.', 'Syndecan-1 (CD138) contributes to prostate cancer progression by stabilizing tumour-initiating cells.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'N6-methyladenine-mediated aberrant activation of the lncRNA SOX2OT-GLI1 loop promotes non-small-cell lung cancer stemness.', 'Integrating the tumor-suppressive activity of Maspin with p53 in retuning the epithelial homeostasis: A working hypothesis and applicable prospects.', 'The vulnerable primed cancer stem cells in disguise: demystifying the role of Maspin.', '2D disposable stochastic sensors for molecular recognition and quantification of maspin in biological samples.', 'Salinomycin as a potent anticancer stem cell agent: State of the art and future directions.']"""

Patients were irradiated using fraction dose varied from 6 to 15 Gy (median 10), to the total dose of 24 to 45 Gy (median 30). Irradiated lymph node size varied from 0.4 to 4.0 cm. In all, 9 patients had single lymph node metastasis and 9 patients had metastases of 2 to 4 lymph nodes. Prostate-specific antigen concentration before radiotherapy varied from 0.01 to 15.58 (mean 6.97; median 4.66). All patients at the time of radiotherapy and follow-up received androgen deprivation therapy. Mann-Whitney U, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank tests were used in statistical analysis.

A total of 229 incident cases and 250 controls attended the same urology out-patient clinics at 2 major hospitals and private practitioners in the Kingston, Jamaica metropolitan area between March 2005 and July 2007.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, with DII as continuous and expressed as quartiles. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, total energy intake, education, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and family history of prostate cancer.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of Ang-(1-7) on hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the probable mechanisms. H22 hepatoma-bearing mice were randomly divided into five groups for treatment: mock group, low-dose Ang-(1-7), high-dose Ang-(1-7), high-dose Ang-(1-7) + A779 and high-dose Ang-(1-7) + PD123319. Ang-(1-7) treatment inhibited tumor growth time- and dose-dependently by arresting tumor proliferation and promoting tumor apoptosis as well as inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. The effects of Ang-(1-7) on tumor proliferation and apoptosis were reversed by coadministration with A779 or PD123319, whereas the effects on tumor angiogenesis were completely reversed by A779 but not by PD123319. Moreover, Ang-(1-7) downregulated AT1R mRNA, upregulated mRNA levels of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) and Mas receptor (MasR) and p38-MAPK phosphorylation and suppressed H22 cell-endothelial cell communication.

A pilot test was conducted to investigate the internal consistency of the the Champion Health Belief Model Scale for prostate cancer screening and the clarity of survey questions. Sample characteristics and rates of participation in prostate cancer screening were examined using means and frequencies. Important factors associated with participation in prostate cancer screening were examined using bivariate correlation and multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Four out of the seven HBM-driven factors (perceived susceptibility, benefits and barriers to PSA test, and health motivation) were statistically significant. Those with greater levels of susceptibility, benefits of PSA test and health motivation and lower levels of barriers to PSA testing were more likely to participate in prostate cancer screening. Family history, presence of urinary symptoms, age, and knowledge about prostate cancer significantly predicted the participation in prostate cancer screening.

Materials and methods:   A prospective study was conducted of all men undergoing 12 core ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for suspicion of cancer attending the Hospital DIPRECA and Hospital de Carabineros de Chile. Total serum PSA was registered, prostate volumecalculated at the moment of biopsy, and an 8 ml blood simple taken immediately before the biopsy procedure. Mononuclear cells were obtained from the blood simple using differential gel centrifugation and CPCs identified using immunocytchemistry with anti- PSA and anti-P504S. Biopsy results were classed as positive or negative for cancer and if positive the Gleason score, number of positive cores and percent infiltration recorded.  Results:   A total of 664 men participated, of whom 234 (35.2%) had cancer detected. They were older, had higher mean PSA, PSA density and lower PSA-AV. Detection of CPCs had high predictive score, sensitivity, sensibility and positive and negative predictive values, PSA-AV was not significantly different from PSA density in this population. The use of CPC detection avoided more biopsies and missed fewer significant cancers.  Conclusions:   In this screening population the use of CPC detection predicted the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer better than the other parameters. The high negative predictive value would allow men CPC negative to avoid biopsy but remain in follow up. The formula PSA-AV did not add to the predictive performance using PSA density.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Nelson Orellana', 'Francisca Morales', 'Omar Jacob']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Head to Head Comparison of the Chun Nomogram, Percentage Free PSA and Primary Circulating Prostate Cells to Predict the Presence of Prostate Cancer at Repeat Biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer screening in the fit Chilean elderly: a head to head comparison of total serum PSA versus age adjusted PSA versus primary circulating prostate cells to detect prostate cancer at initial biopsy.', 'Comparison of two on-line risk calculators versus the detection of circulating prostate cells for the detection of high risk prostate cancer at first biopsy..', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Current evidence and future perspectives about the role of iXip® in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of PSA-age volume score in predicting prostate cancer in Chinese population.']"""

The cancer incidence data from nuclear medicine and oncology institutes were gathered and presented.  Materials and methods:   The cancer incidence data for the last 30 years (1984-2014) are included to describe a data set of male and female patients. The data analysis concerning occurrence, trends of common cancers in male and female patients, stage-wise distribution, and mortality/follow-up cases is also incorporated for the last 10 years (2004-2014).  Results:   The total population of provincial capital Lahore is 9,800,000. The total number of cancer cases was 80,390 (males 32,156, females 48,134). The crude incidence rates in PAECCR areas were 580.8/105 during 2010 to 885.4/105 in 2014 (males 354.1/105, females 530.1/105). The cancer incidence rates for head and neck (15.70%), brain tumors (10.5%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 9.53%) were found to be the highest in male patients, whereas breast cancer (46.7%), ovary tumors (6.80%), and cervix (6.31%) cancer incidence rates were observed to be the most common in female patients. The age range distribution of diagnosed and treated patients in conjunction with the percentage contribution of cancer patients from 15 different cities of Punjab province treated at the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, Lahore are also included. Leukemia was found to be the most common cancer for the age group of 1-12 years. It has been identified that the maximum number of diagnosed cases were found in the age range of 51-60 years for males and 41-50 years for female cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Overall cancer incidence of the thirty years demonstrated that head and neck and breast cancers in males and in females respectively are the most common cancers in Punjab province in Pakistan, at rates almost the highest in Asia, requiring especial attention. The incidence of brain, NHL, and prostate cancers among males and ovarian and cervix cancers among females have increased rapidly. These data from a major population of Punjab province should be helpful for implementation of appropriate planning, prevention and cancer control measures and for determination of risk factors within the country.""","""['Khalid Masood', 'Andleeb Masood', 'Junaid Zafar', 'Abubaker Shahid', 'Mujahid Kamran', 'Sohail Murad', 'Misbah Masood', 'Zafar Alluddin', 'Masooma Riaz', 'Naseem Akhter', 'Munir Ahmad', 'Fayyaz Ahmad', 'Javaid Akhtar', 'Muhammad Naeem']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['A statistical evaluation of common cancer trends and cancer occurrence by age group in the population of Lahore, Pakistan, 1984-2011.', 'Thirty Years Cancer Incidence Data for Lahore, Pakistan: Trends and Patterns 1984-2014.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Childhood cancer incidence in India: a review of population-based cancer registries.', 'Part I: Cancer in Indigenous Africans--burden, distribution, and trends.', 'Body Mass Index and Other Risk Factors Effects on Colon Cancer Prognosis in Pakistan.', 'Comparing High and Low-Dose Radio-Iodine Therapy in Thyroid Remnant Ablation Among Intermediate and Low-Risk Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Patients-Single Centre Experience.', 'Recent insights into breast cancer incidence trends among four Asian countries using age-period-cohort model.', 'Mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in a South Asian population.', 'Cancer and how the patients see it; prevalence and perception of risk factors: a cross-sectional survey from a tertiary care centre of Karachi, Pakistan.']"""

Materials and methods:   From January 2010 to December 2013, a total of 225 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) underwent tPSA and %fPSA measurements. Histological examination with calculation of Gleason score and whole body bone scans were performed in identified cases of PCa.  Results:   PCa was diagnosed in 44 (19.6%) patients and the remaining 181 patients had benign prostate disease. PCa was detected in 5 (23.8%), 13 (8.7%) and 26 (47.3%) cases with tPSA level ranges≤4 ng/ml, 4 to 10 ng/ml and >10 ng/ml, respectively. The average Gleason score was 7.2±0.2.

Methods:   In a large U.S. cohort study, intakes of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and a meat-derived mutagenicity (MDM) index were assessed using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 1996. Until 2010, 2,770 prostate cancer cases were observed among 26,030 participants.  Results:   Intake of PhIP from red meat was statistically significantly associated with total prostate cancer risk (top vs. bottom quintile HR, 1.18; 95% confidence intervals; CI, 1.03-1.35), but not other HCAs (MeIQx, 1.12; 0.98-1.27, PhIP from white meat, 1.08; 0.95-1.22, DiMeIQx, 1.09; 0.97-1.21) or MDM (1.13; 1.00-1.28). For high-grade (Gleason sum 7 with pattern 4+3 and Gleason sum 8-10, n = 483 cases) and advanced cancers (n = 281), we only observed positive associations for PhIP from red meat (top vs. bottom quintile: high grade: HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04-1.98, Ptrend = 0.03; advanced: HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.99-2.26; Ptrend = 0.12), but associations for advanced cancers did not reach statistical significance.

It regulates the stability of a number of human transcription factors and tumor suppressors and plays a critical role in the development of several types of cancer, including prostate and small cell lung cancer. In addition, human USP7 is targeted by several viruses of the Herpesviridae family and is required for effective herpesvirus infection. The USP7 C-terminal region (C-USP7) contains five ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1-5) that interact with several USP7 substrates. Although structures of the USP7 C terminus bound to its substrates could provide vital information for understanding USP7 substrate specificity, no such data has been available to date. In this work we have demonstrated that the USP7 ubiquitin-like domains can be studied in isolation by solution NMR spectroscopy, and we have determined the structure of the UBL1 domain. Furthermore, we have employed NMR and viral plaque assays to probe the interaction between the C-USP7 and HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP0 (infected cell protein 0), which is essential for efficient lytic infection and virus reactivation from latency. We have shown that depletion of the USP7 in HFF-1 cells negatively affects the efficiency of HSV-1 lytic infection. We have also found that USP7 directly binds ICP0 via its C-terminal UBL1-2 domains and mapped the USP7-binding site for ICP0. Therefore, this study represents a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of C-USP7 specificity toward its substrates and may provide the basis for future development of novel antiviral and anticancer therapies.""","""['Alexandra K Pozhidaeva', 'Kareem N Mohni', 'Sirano Dhe-Paganon', 'Cheryl H Arrowsmith', 'Sandra K Weller', 'Dmitry M Korzhnev', 'Irina Bezsonova']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Crystal Structure of USP7 Ubiquitin-like Domains with an ICP0 Peptide Reveals a Novel Mechanism Used by Viral and Cellular Proteins to Target USP7.', 'Identification of a novel higher molecular weight isoform of USP7/HAUSP that interacts with the Herpes simplex virus type-1 immediate early protein ICP0.', 'Impact of the interaction between herpes simplex virus type 1 regulatory protein ICP0 and ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 on activation of adeno-associated virus type 2 rep gene expression.', 'The HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0: Modifying the cellular proteome to promote infection.', 'Role of ICP0 in the strategy of conquest of the host cell by herpes simplex virus 1.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Next-Generation Phage Display to Identify Peptide Ligands of Deubiquitinases.', 'Methyltransferase-like 3 Aggravates HCC Development via Mediating N6-Methyladenosine of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 7.', 'METTL3 facilitates the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by modulating the m6A level of USP7.', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7: A Novel Deubiquitinase That Regulates Protein Homeostasis and Cancers.']"""

Methods:   Public Health England provided prostate cancer incidence and mortality data for England (2008-2010) by major ethnic group. Ethnicity and mortality data were incomplete, requiring various assumptions and adjustments before lifetime risk was calculated using DevCan (percent, range).  Results:   The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 1 in 8 (13.3 %, 13.2-15.0 %) for White men, 1 in 4 (29.3 %, 23.5-37.2 %) for Black men, and 1 in 13 (7.9 %, 6.3-10.5 %) for Asian men, whereas that of dying from prostate cancer is approximately 1 in 24 (4.2 %, 4.2-4.7 %) for White men, 1 in 12 (8.7 %, 7.6-10.6 %) for Black men, and 1 in 44 (2.3 %, 1.9-3.0 %) for Asian men.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical factors associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Univariate analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods, and multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   The median BChE level was 255 U/L (normal range 168-470 U/L). The median age of the enrolled patients was 68 years, and the median PSA level at diagnosis of PCa was 8.39 ng/mL.

Methods:   97 men with a mean age of 66.2 (44-82) years underwent PHS augmented TRUS analysis prior to a repeat Bx. Three PHS positive foci were defined in accordance with 6 bilateral prostatic sectors. Targeted Bx (tBx) limited to PHS positive foci and a systematic 14-core backup Bx (sBx) were taken. Results were correlated to biopsy outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive accuracy, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated.  Results:   PCa was found in 31 of 97 (32%) patients. Detection rate in tBx was significantly higher (p < .001). Detection rate in tBx and sBx did not differ on patient level (p ≥ 0.7).

Methods:   Between 2002 and 2012, 758 consecutive patients underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Surgery was carried out by open retropubic RP in 545 (73.1%) of patients and laparoscopic RP in 201 (27%) by 5 surgeons who were excluded from data collection and analysis. The following symptoms were collected from the last urological check-ups or pre-operative consultation and classified as: storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, post micturition symptoms, history of acute urinary retention, benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment, history of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  Results:   A total of 661 patients were included on analysis: 136 (20.6%) patients reported low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 162 (24.5%) were considered incontinent after RP, and 45 (33.1%) of them reported LUTS before surgery. Postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPUI) was significantly different in patients with LUTS (117 [22.3%] vs. 45 [33.1%], P=0.009). The presence of any LUTS influence significantly in the appearance of PPUI (OR=1.72 [95% CI: 1.14-2.6), P=0.01). TURP is independently influential in PPUI (OR=6.13 [95% CI: 1.86-20.18], P=0.003). A patient with LUTS before surgery has an increased risk of 70% or even 200% to suffer PPUI and a patient who received treatment by TURP is 6 times at higher risk of PPUI.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, patients with LUTS are likely to present PPUI. History of TURP is influential by itself over PPUI.

However, adoption of a couples-focused approach into cancer care is limited. Previous research has shown that patients and partners hold differing views from health care professionals (HCPs) regarding their psychosocial needs, and HCPs from different disciplines also hold divergent views regarding couples' psychosocial needs. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of HCPs and couples on the provision of couple-focused psychosocial care in routine cancer services.  Methods:   A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken with 20 HCPs (medical oncologists, nurses, psycho-oncology professionals) and 20 couples where one member had been diagnosed with cancer (breast, prostate, head/neck, bowel, multiple myeloma). Interviews were analysed using the framework approach.  Results:   Three core themes were identified: ""How Do Couples Cope with Cancer?"" emphasised the positive and negative coping strategies used by couples, and highlighted that partners perceived a lack of engagement by HCPs. ""What Is Couple-focused Psychosocial Care for People with Cancer?"" described varying perspectives regarding the value of couple-focused psychosocial care and variation in the types of support couples need among HCPs and couples. Whereas most couples did not perceive a need for specialist couple-focused support and interventions, most HCPs felt couple-focused psychosocial care was necessary. ""How Can Couple-Focused Psychosocial Care be Improved?"" described couples' view of a need for better provision of information, and the importance of their relationship with oncology clinicians. HCPs identified a lack of confidence in responding to the emotional needs of couples, and barriers to providing psychosocial care, including challenges identifying distress (through screening) and referring distressed individuals/couples for specialist assessment.  Conclusions:   The three core themes revealed discrepancies about couple-focused psychosocial care between HCPs and couples, and HCPs from different professional backgrounds, and several barriers to the provision of psychosocial care for couples. Despite HCPs and couples acknowledging that a couple-focused approach to psycho-social support was potentially beneficial, the majority of couples did not feel they needed specific couple-focused interventions. These issues and recommendations for future research are discussed.""","""['Tim Regan', 'Janelle V Levesque', 'Sylvie D Lambert', 'Brian Kelly']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Do couple-based interventions make a difference for couples affected by cancer?

Three exposure scenarios are considered: inhalation dose to an individual due to the hypothetical inhalation of 219Rn and its progeny assumed to be released into the air from a liquid spill on the floor, external dose from direct photon exposure of an individual assigned to clean up a spill, and skin dose to an individual should the liquid material come into contact with their skin. Doses from the first two scenarios were very small; 2.8 × 10(-3) mSv and 8.1 × 10(-4) mSv, respectively. Using extremely conservative assumptions, the skin dose was estimated to be 72 mSv; in a realistic scenario, this dose would likely be an order of magnitude or more lower. These doses are very small compared to regulatory limits, and good health physics practices likely to be employed in such incidents would lower them still further. The authors conclude that the medical use of Xofigo does not pose any significant radiation safety issue with respect to potential contamination events, even if multiple incidents might occur during the course of a year, since all worst-case potential contamination events considered in this study will not result in significant radiation exposures to workers.""","""['Michael G Stabin', 'Jeffry A Siegel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Phys""","""['Bone-specific therapy with radium-223 dichloride : Castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Alpha emitter radium-223 dichloride: new therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radium-223 dichloride in clinical practice: a review.', 'Nuclear Medicine Therapy With 223Radium-dichloride for Osseous Metastases in Prostate Carcinoma.', 'A Phase 1, Open-Label Study of the Biodistribution, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosimetry of 223Ra-Dichloride in Patients with Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?', 'Dosimetry of inhaled 219Rn progeny.', 'A Study of 219Rn Outgassing and 211Pb Contamination from 223Ra In dry, Liquid, and Murine Tissue Samples.', 'Ra-223 Treatment for Bone Metastases in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Practical Management Issues for Patient Selection.']"""

ALKBH3 becomes upregulated during tumorigenesis and is necessary for proliferation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be understood.  Methods:   To further elucidate the function of ALKBH3 in cancer, we performed ChIP-seq to investigate the genomic binding pattern of endogenous ALKBH3 in PC3 prostate cancer cells coupled with microarray experiments to examine the expression effects of ALKBH3 depletion.  Results:   We demonstrate that ALKBH3 binds to transcription associated locations, such as places of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II and enhancers. Strikingly, ALKBH3 strongly binds to the transcription initiation sites of a small number of highly active gene promoters. These promoters are characterized by high levels of transcriptional regulators, including transcription factors, the Mediator complex, cohesin, histone modifiers, and active histone marks. Gene expression analysis showed that ALKBH3 does not directly influence the transcription of its target genes, but its depletion induces an upregulation of ALKBH3 non-bound inflammatory genes.  Conclusions:   The genomic binding pattern of ALKBH3 revealed a putative novel hyperactive promoter type. Further, we propose that ALKBH3 is an intrinsic DNA repair protein that suppresses transcription associated DNA damage at highly expressed genes and thereby plays a role to maintain genomic integrity in ALKBH3-overexpressing cancer cells. These results raise the possibility that ALKBH3 may be a potential target for inhibiting cancer progression.""","""['Robert Liefke', 'Indra M Windhof-Jaidhauser', 'Jochen Gaedcke', 'Gabriela Salinas-Riester', 'Feizhen Wu', 'Michael Ghadimi', 'Sebastian Dango']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Human RAD51 paralogue RAD51C fosters repair of alkylated DNA by interacting with the ALKBH3 demethylase.', 'A real-time PCR-based quantitative assay for 3-methylcytosine demethylase activity of ALKBH3.', 'DNA unwinding by ASCC3 helicase is coupled to ALKBH3-dependent DNA alkylation repair and cancer cell proliferation.', 'Clinical significance and therapeutic potential of prostate cancer antigen-1/ALKBH3 in human renal cell carcinoma.', '""Promoter array"" studies identify cohorts of genes directly regulated by methylation, copy number change, or transcription factor binding in human cancer cells.', 'Engineering diabetic human skin equivalent for in vitro and in vivo applications.', 'Roles of RNA Modifications in Diverse Cellular Functions.', 'Interleukin-17 receptor D (Sef) is a multi-functional regulator of cell signaling.', 'Multi-substrate selectivity based on key loops and non-homologous domains: new insight into ALKBH family.', 'OTUD4 Is a Phospho-Activated K63 Deubiquitinase that Regulates MyD88-Dependent Signaling.']"""

Little human evidence exists for the preventive potential in other malignancies, including breast cancer, with the exception of possible benefit in bladder cancer and an adverse serologic association with prostate cancer (pancreatic cancer risk may be similarly influenced) that is supported by vitamin D genetic data. Current vitamin D trials are examining high-dose supplementation (i.e., 1,600-3,333 IU daily) for effects on multiple outcomes, but they may not have sufficient power to test efficacy in colorectal or other specific malignancies and are unlikely to inform any benefit for higher physiologic levels. A more complete understanding of vitamin D and human carcinogenesis will come from multifaceted lines of research, including elucidation of organ site-specific biologic mechanisms, prospective serologic analyses, testing of vitamin D-related genetic variation, and short-term clinical-metabolic biomarker studies of multidose vitamin D supplementation, including metabolomic profiling of controlled supplementation in these and past or ongoing trials.""","""['Demetrius Albanes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Circulating Vitamin D Levels and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Women.', 'Circulating Vitamin D Levels and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Women.', 'Optimizing vitamin D status to reduce colorectal cancer risk: an evidentiary review.', 'Vitamins, metabolomics, and prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis.', 'Vitamin D and public health: an overview of recent research on common diseases and mortality in adulthood.', 'Vitamin D and Cancer Risk and Mortality: State of the Science, Gaps, and Challenges.', 'Environmental Impact on Intestinal Stem Cell Functions in Mucosal Homeostasis and Tumorigenesis.', 'Metabolomics analysis of serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study.']"""

This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a four-item benefit finding measure from the cancer survivorship supplement of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).  Methods:   Long-term survivors (5-10 years post-diagnosis) of breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer or melanoma (n = 594) completed the MEPS cancer supplement survey in 2013. Four items asked about benefit finding after the cancer: stronger person, coping better, positive changes and having healthier habits. Information on sociodemographics, disease and activity limitations after the cancer was also collected. We examined factor structure, reliability (Kuder-Richardson 20) and validity.  Results:   The four benefit finding items did not appear to measure one factor. Three of the benefit finding items (stronger person, coping better, positive changes) were related to gender, receipt of chemotherapy and activity limitations but not cancer stage, time since diagnosis or income. Having healthier habits was unrelated to any sociodemographic or disease variable.  Conclusions:   Three of the items (stronger person, coping better, positive changes) appeared to have validity as they were related to variables that literature has shown are related to benefit finding. However, having healthier habits is likely measuring a separate but related construct.

Conditional PCSM improved in all three groups over time. Among patients with T4 disease, 5-year PCSM improved from 13.9% at diagnosis to 11.2, 8.1, and 6.5% conditioned on 5, 10, or 15 years of survival, respectively (p < 0.001 in all cases). In patients with N1 disease, 5-year PCSM increased within the first five years and decreased thereafter, from 18.9% at diagnosis to 21.4% (p < 0.001), 17.6% (p = 0.055), and 13.8% (p < 0.001), respectively. In patients with metastatic disease, 5-year PCSM improved from 57.2% at diagnosis to 41.1, 28.8, and 20.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). White race was associated with a greater increase in conditional survival compared to non-white race among those with T4 or N1 disease.  Conclusions:   While patients with T4, N1, or M1 prostate cancer are never ""cured,"" their odds of cancer-specific survival increase substantially after they have survived for 5 or more years.

Neither denosumab nor abiraterone is known to cause rhabdomyolysis.  Case presentation:   A 76-year-old Caucasian man with metastatic prostate cancer presented with non-oliguric severe acute kidney injury (AKI) 3 weeks after receiving simultaneous therapy with denosumab and abiraterone. The patient had been on statin therapy for more than 1 year with no recent dose adjustments. His physical exam was unremarkable. Blood work on admission revealed hyperkalemia, mild metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) at 44,476 IU/L. Kidney biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. The patient responded well to intravenous isotonic fluids and discontinuation of denosumab, abiraterone, and rosuvastatin, with normalization of CK and recovery of kidney function.  Conclusion:   We report the first case of biopsy-proven rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in a cancer patient acutely exposed to denosumab and abiraterone.

Although orexin-A, its precursor molecule prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor have been detected in the human normal and hyperplastic prostate tissues, their expression and function in the prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be addressed.

Orexin-A administration to the human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP up-regulates OX1 receptor expression resulting in a decrease of cell survival. Noteworthy, nanomolar concentrations of the peptide counteract the testosterone-induced nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor in the cells: the orexin-A action is prevented by the addition of the OX1 receptor antagonist SB-408124 to the test system.

Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) is most commonly performed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Alternative ways of estimating BMD, such as quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement of the heel, are explored as DXA is expensive, non-portable and uses ionising radiation. We therefore investigated the diagnostic value of QUS as compared with DXA in patients commencing ADT.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study of 60 patients with prostate cancer who were about to start ADT, BMD was measured with DXA and QUS. The fracture risk score, as implemented by the Dutch National Osteoporosis Guideline, was also measured.  Results:   No significant correlations were found between the separate DXA T scores and worst DXA T score, and the QUS T scores. Correlations between DXA T scores/QUS scores and fracture risk score were also non-significant. If QUS had been used as a screening tool, with a threshold of T ≤ -0.5 to perform DXA, then relevant osteopenia/osteoporosis (worst DXA T score ≤ -2.0) would have been missed in 1/18 (5.6%) patients. The negative predictive value is 0.95. Using QUS as a screening test prior to DXA and a QUS threshold T score ≤ -0.5 would avoid 21 (35%) DXA scans at the cost of missing one (5.6%) case.  Conclusion:   QUS testing cannot replace DXA scans fully as a diagnostic test. However, QUS can be incorporated as triage test prior to DXA to reduce the need for unnecessary DXA scans and the associated costs.""","""['C van Casteren-Messidoro', 'A M Huisman', 'E Birnie', 'M van Gelder', 'F E van de Geijn', 'P Hamberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neth J Med""","""['Comparison of bone mineral density with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, quantitative ultrasound and single energy x-ray absorptiometry.', 'Usefulness of quantitative heel ultrasound compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in determining bone mineral density in chronic haemodialysis patients.', 'A comparison of quantitative ultrasound of the calcaneus with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in hospitalized orthopaedic trauma patients.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'Screening for osteoporosis in men: a systematic review for an American College of Physicians guideline.', 'Quantitative ultrasound of the calcaneus (QUS): A valuable tool in the identification of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer requiring screening for osteoporosis.']"""

This method is prone to error and can be time-consuming because of its manual nature. Therefore, we propose an automated measuring method for positioning error to improve patient throughput and achieve higher reliability. The error between a position on the DR and a position on the DRR was calculated to determine the best matched position using the block-matching method. The zero-mean normalized cross correlation was used as our evaluation function, and the Gaussian weight function was used to increase importance as the pixel position approached the isocenter. The accuracy of the calculation method was evaluated using pelvic phantom images, and the method's effectiveness was evaluated on images of prostate cancer patients before the positioning, comparing them with the results of radiology technicians' measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the calculation method for the pelvic phantom was 0.23 ± 0.05 mm. The coefficients between the calculation method and the measurement results of the technicians were 0.989 for the phantom images and 0.980 for the patient images. The RMSE of the total evaluation results of positioning for prostate cancer patients using the calculation method was 0.32 ± 0.18 mm. Using the proposed method, we successfully measured residual positioning errors.

The TZ tumours compared with PZ tumours were larger (median 5.67 vs 3.64 mL, P < 0.001), more frequently lower grade (Gleason score 6 33% vs 5%, P < 0.01), organ confined (51% vs 35.6%, P = 0.073), and preferentially involved the bladder neck (49% vs 6%, P < 0.001). Tumour zonality was not associated with BCR for the entire cohort. TZ and PZ tumours had similar 5-year BCR-free survival rates (58% vs 63%, P = 0.691) and comparable time to development of BCR (14.4 vs 19.2 months, P = 0.346). On univariate analysis, preoperative PSA level, PSM at the bladder neck, tumour volume, Gleason score (P < 0.001) and tumour stage were independent predictors of BCR for the entire cohort. On multivariate analysis tumour volume and Gleason score retained significance as independent predictors of BCR. Tumour zonality was not directly associated with BCR. Of the patients who received adjuvant therapy, the incidence of BCR was similar for TZ and PZ tumours (58% vs 67%, P = 0.077), although TZ tumours failed significantly earlier (mean 4.4 vs 16.4 months, P = 0.037).  Conclusions:   PSA recurrence in patients with histologically confirmed PSMs after RP is independent of the zonal location of the index tumour. However, tumour zonal origin may have an indirect influence on PSA relapse, as TZ tumours tend to be of large volume and more likely involve the bladder neck margin, both risk factors for BCR. Bladder neck margin involvement is associated with higher rates of BCR than other sites of PSMs. The preoperative identification of TZ tumours might aid surgical planning with appropriate alteration of RP technique to incorporate wider surgical margins at the bladder neck. Adjuvant radiotherapy appears to be associated with adverse outcome for TZ tumours, a novel finding which warrants further investigation.""","""[""Luke M O'Neil"", 'Shane Walsh', 'Ronald J Cohen', 'Stephen Lee']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Zonal origin of prostate cancer: comparison of long-term outcomes after radical prostatectomy.', 'Tumor Location and a Tumor Volume over 2.8 cc Predict the Prognosis for Japanese Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The value of transperineal apical prostate biopsy in predicting urethral/apical margin status after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic value of unifocal and multifocal positive surgical margins in a large series of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: what does it mean?']"""

Patients and methods:   Prospective cohort study of the first 200 rural or remote men to access a new OSPC at a public tertiary-level hospital in Western Australia between August 2011 and August 2014. Men attended for urological assessment, and proceeded to same-day transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsies, if appropriate. Referral criteria were either two abnormal age-related prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI), or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) regardless of PSA level.  Results:   The median (range) distance travelled was 1545 (56-3229) km and median (range) time from referral to assessment was 33 (2-165) days. The median (range) age was 62 (38-85) years, PSA level was 6.7 (0.5-360) ng/mL and 39% (78/200) had a suspicious DRE. In all, 92% (184/200) of men proceeded to prostate biopsies, and 60% (111/184) of these men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Our complication rate was 3.5% (6/172). Radical prostatectomy (46/111), active surveillance (28/111) and external beam radiation therapy (26/111) were the commonest subsequent treatment methods. A $1045 (Australian dollars) cost-saving per person was estimated based on the reduced need for travel with the OSPC model.

Patients and methods:   The study population included 2225 patients who underwent prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA levels at our department. We divided our patient collective into four age groups: ≤49 years (n = 178), 50-59 years (n = 597), 60-69 years (n = 962) and ≥70 years (n = 488). We simulated different scenarios for PSA cut-off values between 1.25 and 6 ng/mL and fPSA% between 15 and 21% for all four age groups and calculated sensitivity, specificity, confidence intervals and predictive values.  Results:   PCa was detected in 1218 men (54.7%). We found that in combination with free PSA ≤21% the following PSA cut-offs had the best cancer specificity: 1.75 ng/ml for men ≤49 years and 50-59 years, 2.25 ng/ml for men aged 60-69 years and 3.25 ng/ml for men ≥70 years. Using these adjusted PSA cut-off values all significant tumors are recognized in all age groups, yet the number of biopsies is reduced. Overall, one biopsy is avoided in 13 to 14 men (number needed to screen = 13.3, reduction of biopsies = 7.5%) when decision regarding biopsy is done according to the ""new"" cut-off values instead of the ""old"" ones. For the different age groups the number needed to screen to avoid one biopsy varied between 9.2 (≤49 years) and 17.4 (50-59 years).

Methods:   A prospectively maintained database was reviewed for cases with IPCa at the time of HoLEP. Patients with preoperative PCa were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (group I [GI]) or absence of cancer (group II [GII]) in histopathology. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.  Results:   Of 1242 patients, 70 (5.64%) were identified to have IPCa. Prostate size was comparable between both groups. GI patients had significantly higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA density (tPSAD) compared to cancer-free patients. T1a and T1b adenocarcinomas were detected in 54 (77.1%) and 16 (22.9%) patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 48 (1-171) months, both groups were comparable in all functional outcomes but the quality of life was significantly better in GII.

In this paper we investigate the distribution of hits to cells by multiple alpha particles corresponding to a typical clinically delivered dose using a Monte Carlo model to simulate the stochastic effects. The number of hits and dose deposition were recorded in the cytoplasm and nucleus of each cell. Alpha particle tracks were also visualized. We found that the stochastic variation in dose deposited in cell nuclei ([Formula: see text]40%) can be attributed in part to the variation in LET with pathlength. We also found that [Formula: see text]18% of cell nuclei receive less than one sigma below the average dose per cell ([Formula: see text]15.4 Gy).

Given the increasing interest in multiple imputation methods, we explored the interest of a multiple imputation approach in the estimation of cause-specific survival, when a subset of causes of death was observed.  Methods:   By using European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), 20 multiply imputed datasets were created and analyzed with a Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) algorithm. Then, cause-specific survival was estimated on each dataset with two methods: Kaplan-Meier and competing risks. The two pooled cause-specific survival and confidence intervals were obtained using Rubin's rules after complementary log-log transformation. Net survival was estimated using Pohar-Perme's estimator and was compared to pooled cause-specific survival. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of our constructed multiple imputation model.  Results:   Cause-specific survival performed better than net survival, since this latter exceeded 100 % for almost the first 2 years of follow-up and after 9 years whereas the cause-specific survival decreased slowly and than stabilized at around 94 % at 9 years. Sensibility study results were satisfactory.

Four MAR techniques are investigated to mitigate seed artifacts from post-implant CT images of a homogeneous phantom and eight prostate patients: a raw sinogram approach using the original CT scanner data and three methods (simple threshold replacement (STR), 3D median filter, and virtual sinogram) requiring only the reconstructed CT image. Virtual patient models are developed using six TAS ranging from the AAPM-ESTRO-ABG TG-186 basic approach of assigning uniform density tissues (resulting in a model not dependent on MAR) to more complex models assigning prostate, calcification, and mixtures of prostate and calcification using CT-derived densities. The EGSnrc user-code BrachyDose is employed to calculate dose distributions. All four MAR methods eliminate bright seed spot artifacts, and the image-based methods provide comparable mitigation of artifacts compared with the raw sinogram approach. However, each MAR technique has limitations: STR is unable to mitigate low CT number artifacts, the median filter blurs the image which challenges the preservation of tissue heterogeneities, and both sinogram approaches introduce new streaks. Large local dose differences are generally due to differences in voxel tissue-type rather than mass density. The largest differences in target dose metrics (D90, V100, V150), over 50% lower compared to the other models, are when uncorrected CT images are used with TAS that consider calcifications. Metrics found using models which include calcifications are generally a few percent lower than prostate-only models. Generally, metrics from any MAR method and any TAS which considers calcifications agree within 6%. Overall, the studied MAR methods and TAS show promise for further retrospective MC dose calculation studies for various permanent implant brachytherapy treatments.""","""['N Miksys', 'C Xu', 'L Beaulieu', 'R M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Metallic artifact mitigation and organ-constrained tissue assignment for Monte Carlo calculations of permanent implant lung brachytherapy.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric effects of metallic artifact reduction and tissue assignment on Monte Carlo dose calculations for 125 I prostate implants.', 'Patient-specific Monte Carlo dose calculations for (103)Pd breast brachytherapy.', 'Improved tissue assignment using dual-energy computed tomography in low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy for Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Large-scale Retrospective Monte Carlo Dosimetric Study for Permanent Implant Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'The application of metal artifact reduction methods on computed tomography scans for radiotherapy applications: A literature review.']"""

First, using western blot analysis, we show that the expression of TBX15 was altered in thyroid cancer cells lines with respect to normal thyroid cells. Transfection of thyroid cancer cells with TBX15, in the presence or absence of camptothecin as a cytotoxic agent, proved non effect of TBX15 in cell viability; but, it increased cell proliferation after 48 h of transfection (P < 0.01). Consistently, apoptosis was reduced in TBX15 transfected cells (P < 0.01) which also showed a decrease of the proapoptotic Bax regulator and an increase of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL regulators. Additionally, siRNA shutdown of constitutive TBX15 increased apoptosis. TBX15 transfection did not alter colony formation and cell migration.

Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5D (KDM5D) is located on the AZFb region of the Y chromosome and encodes a JmjC-domain-containing protein. KDM5D, the least well-documented member of the KDM5 family, is capable of demethylating di- and trimethyl H3K4. In this study, we detected two novel splice variants of KDM5D with lengths of 2650bp and 2400bp that correspond to the 100 and 80 kDa proteins in the human prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. The knockdown of two variants using the short interfering RNA (siRNA) approach increased the growth rate of prostate cancer cells and reduced cell apoptosis. To explore the proteome pattern of the cells after KDM5D downregulation, we applied a shotgun label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Of 820 proteins present in all four replicates of two treatments, the abundance of 209 proteins changed significantly in response to KDM5D suppression. Of these, there were 102 proteins observed to be less abundant and 107 more abundant in KDM5D knockdown cells compared with control cells. The results revealed that KDM5D knockdown altered the abundance of proteins involved in RNA processing, protein synthesis, apoptosis, the cell cycle, and growth and proliferation. In conjunction, these results provided new insights into the function of KDM5D and its splice variants.

Here we examine published articles that explore this association.  Methods:   We searched MEDLINE through PubMed and Embase for articles reporting on the association between PCa and circumcision, and performed a meta-analysis of qualifying studies.  Results:   On the basis of seven reports of case-control studies published from 1971 to 2014, overall findings showed nonsignificant reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, P=0.19) of PCa in circumcised men compared with uncircumcised men, obtained under heterogeneous conditions (I(2)=65%). Heterogeneity and nonsignificance were erased when the overall effect was subjected to outlier treatment and three studies omitted (OR 0.90, P=0.04, I(2)=0%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed significantly reduced risks in the following subgroups: (i) post-PSA testing publications (OR 0.88, P=0.01), (ii) population-based studies (OR 0.84, P=0.05), (iii) studies that collected data by personal interview (OR 0.83, P=0.03) and (iv) studies in black race (OR 0.59, P=0.02). The strengths of these summary effects lie in the robustness revealed by sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   Stability of the reduced risks observed in key subgroups suggests that the protective feature of circumcision status against PCa is best seen in the context of the post-PSA testing and population-based studies as well as in the black race subgroup.""","""['N Pabalan', 'E Singian', 'H Jarjanazi', 'A Paganini-Hill']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Circumcision and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Circumcision status and risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men: a meta-analysis.', 'Circumcision and prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study in Montréal, Canada.', 'The Association of Circumcision and Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Genital ulcerative disease and sexually transmitted urethritis and circumcision: a meta-analysis.', 'Evidence-based circumcision policy for Australia.', 'Male circumcision and prostate cancer: A geographical analysis, meta-analysis, and cost analysis.', 'Critical evaluation of arguments opposing male circumcision: A systematic review.', 'Identification of low oxygen-tolerating bacteria in prostate secretions of cancer patients and discussion of possible aetiological significance.', ""CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure.""]"""

Methods:   We relied on 40 patients suspicious for prostate cancer who underwent standard and TT-derived prostate biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the area under the curve (AUC) were assessed for the prediction of biopsy results per octant by HistoScanning™, using different HistoScanning™ signal volume cutoffs (>0, >0.2 and >0.5 ml).  Results:   Overall, 319 octants were analyzed. Of those, 64 (20.1 %) harbored prostate cancer. According to different HistoScanning™ signal volume cutoffs (>0, >0.2 and >0.5 ml), the AUCs for predicting biopsy results were: 0.51, 0.51 and 0.53, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values were: 20.7, 78.2, 17.4 and 81.6 %; 20.7, 82.0, 20.3 and 82.3 %; and 12.1, 94.6, 33.3 and 82.9 %, respectively.  Conclusions:   Prediction of biopsy results based on HistoScanning™ signals and TT-derived biopsies was unreliable. Moreover, the AUC of TT-derived biopsies was low and did not improve when additional signal volume cutoffs were applied (>0.2 and >0.5 ml).

This metabolic process is involved in the control of systemic and local androgen bioavailability.  Objective:   To examine the relationship among expression of the androgen-inactivating UGT2B28 enzyme, circulating steroid hormone levels, and clinical phenotype in prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted an analysis of a high-density prostate tumor tissue microarray consisting of 239 localized PCa cases. The study of 51 additional PCa patients with no copies of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2B subfamily, polypeptide B28 (UGT2B28) in their genomes was performed to confirm the importance of the enzyme on circulating hormone levels.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Steroid hormones were measured by mass spectrometry. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the influence of UGT2B28 on progression, and general linear model regression evaluated variations in hormone levels.  Results and limitations:   Tumor overexpression of UGT2B28 was associated with lower prostate-specific antigen levels at diagnosis, higher Gleason scores, margin and nodal invasion status, and it was shown to be an independent prognostic factor associated with progression. Enzyme overexpression correlated with 30% higher circulating levels of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Patients with no copies of UGT2B28 in their genomes have lower levels of T (19%), DHT (17%), its glucuronide metabolites (18-38%), and enhanced levels of the adrenal precursor androstenedione (36%).  Conclusions:   The UGT2B28 steroid-inactivating pathway modifies circulating T and DHT levels, and UGT2B28 overexpression is associated with high-grade PCa. Our work has uncovered the role of UGT2B28 as a regulator of steroidogenesis and underscores the interconnectivity among the steroid-inactivation capacity of cancer cells, hormone levels, disease characteristics, and the risk of cancer progression.

This study aimed to integrate previous results and explore the validity of this association. Electronic searches for all relevant publications through May 18, 2014, were conducted across several databases. Additional studies were identified manually, and only the most recent or complete were used in this meta-analysis. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Seven eligible case-control studies were identified, incorporating a total of 14,049 patients and 12,674 controls. Overall, we found that the rs4430796 (A>G) polymorphism had a decreased risk of prostate cancer (GG vs AA: OR = 0.661, 95%CI = 0.615-0.710, P = 0.304; AG vs AA: OR = 0.782, 95%CI = 0.739-0.828, P = 0.435; dominant model: OR = 0.743, 95%CI = 0.704-0.784, P = 0.912; recessive model: OR = 0.764, 95%CI = 0.718-0.813, P = 0.01). Furthermore, in the stratified analysis, there were significantly decreased risks among studies with population- and hospital-based controls.

In particular, little is known about the putative association of shift work with prostate cancer.  Method:   We studied a cohort of 27,828 male industrial production workers residing in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate who worked for at least one year in a chemical company in the period 1995-2005. We obtained data on shift work and potential confounders including age, occupational task, and duration of employment from personnel files and from the records of the occupational health service. New cases of cancer in the period 2000-2009 were ascertained from the state cancer registry. Differences in risk between shift workers and daytime workers were analyzed with Cox regression, stratified by stage of cancer, and adjusted for potential confounding effects.  Results:   There were 146 new cases of prostate cancer in 12,609 rotating shift workers and 191 in 15,219 daytime workers. The median year of birth was 1960 in the first group and 1959 in the second. The shift workers did not have an elevated hazard ratio for prostate cancer in comparison to the daytime workers (HR = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-1.18). Some differences were seen depending on tumor stage. Both groups of workers had a higher incidence of prostate carcinoma than the general population (standardized incidence rate [SIR] = 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.70 for daytime workers; SIR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.30-1.74 for shift workers).  Conclusion:   In this well-documented, large-scale cohort study, the incidence of prostate cancer among shift workers did not differ from that among daytime workers.

Results:   No significant difference was found for age, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical and pathological stage, Gleason score on biopsy and prostatectomy specimen, tumor volume, positive surgical margin, and lymph node status. Transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had shorter trocar insertion time (16.0 vs 25.9 min for transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, P < 0.001), whereas extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had shorter console time (101.5 vs 118.3 min, respectively, P < 0.001).

In addition, two control groups were formed of patients with the same primary cancer but without metastases ('cancer controls') and patients without cancer ('healthy controls'), matched for age, sex, and practice. All symptoms, signs, and laboratory test abnormalities in the year before metastasis were identified. The primary analysis used conditional logistic regression.  Results:   In total, 162 cases, 152 cancer controls, and 145 healthy controls were studied.

This study screened natural products to identify compounds that inhibit STAT3 activity using a STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter system. Sugiol was identified as a compound that decreased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Sugiol specifically inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 in DU145 prostate cells, and this inhibition was independent of the STAT3 upstream kinase. Sugiol induced cell cycle arrest and decreased the expression levels of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin D1, cyclin A, and survivin. Notably, we observed that sugiol interacted with transketolase, an enzyme in central metabolism, and increased ROS levels leading to the activation of ERK, which inhibits STAT3 activity. The protein phosphatase MEG2 was also responsible for sugiol-induced STAT3 dephosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of sugiol on cell growth was confirmed using the DU145 mouse xenograft model. We propose that sugiol inhibits STAT3 activity through a mechanism that involves the inhibition of transketolase, which leads to increased ROS levels and MEG2 activation in DU145 cells.

Analysis of both HSD3B and SRD5A activities using a live cell in situ colourimetric assay demonstrated that in PC-3 cells HSD3B activity was significantly increased by oxytocin whilst SRD5A activity was unchanged. This was confirmed in ELISA based assays of conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in cell lysates following treatment.

However, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents may induce damage in healthy cells and tissues. Thus, in recent years, there has been an increased focus on the development of new, efficient anticancer drugs exhibiting low toxicity and that are not affected by mechanisms of chemoresistance. In the present work, we tested synthetic and naturally obtained human salivary peptides against breast, prostate, colon, osteosarcoma and bladder cancer cell lines (T47-D, PC-3, HT-29, MG63, T-24, respectively). Results have showed that there is a reduced cell population increase that is peptide-, cell- and possibly pathway-specific, with the most potent effect observed in observed in T-47D breast cancer cells. Protein expression and microscopy results further indicate that, in this cell line, the peptide with the sequence GPPPQGGRPQG (GG peptide) interferes with the ability of cell adhesion proteins to stabilize adherens junctions, such as E-cadherin, leading to apoptosis. These promising results encourage future works aimed at disclosing the vast potential of salivary peptides as new therapeutic agents.""","""['João Pinto da Costa', 'Virginia Carvalhais', 'Francisco Amado', 'Artur Silva', 'Rita Nogueira-Ferreira', 'Rita Ferreira', 'Luísa Helguero', 'Rui Vitorino']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Peptides""","""['Deletion of exon 8 increases cisplatin-induced E-cadherin cleavage.', 'Induction of apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells by a cadherin antagonist peptide: involvement of fibroblast growth factor receptor-mediated signalling.', 'Antitumor and antimetastatic effect of antimicrobial peptide conjugated with tumor homing peptide TMTP1 on the transplanted prostate cancer and gastric cancer in nude mice.', 'Advanced targeted therapies in cancer: Drug nanocarriers, the future of chemotherapy.', 'Cadherins as novel targets for anti-cancer therapy.', 'Natural Peptides Inducing Cancer Cell Death: Mechanisms and Properties of Specific Candidates for Cancer Therapeutics.', 'A Review of the Latest Advances in Encrypted Bioactive Peptides from Protein-Rich Waste.']"""

This process involves the creation, by tumor and stroma cells, of a specific microenvironment, suitable for proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells. The ADAM family of proteins has been involved in these processes. This work aimed to investigate the role of the recombinant disintegrin domain of the human ADAM9 (rADAM9D) on the adhesive and mobility properties of DU145 prostate tumor cells. rADAM9D was able to support DU145 cell adhesion, inhibit the migration of DU145 cells, as well as the invasion of this cell line through matrigel in vitro. Overall this work demonstrates that rADAM9D induces specific cellular migratory properties when compared with different constructs having additional domains, specially those of metalloproteinase and cysteine-rich domains. Furthermore, we showed that rADAM9D was able to inhibit cell adhesion, migration and invasion mainly through interacting with α6β1 in DU145 tumor cell line. These results may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.""","""['Ana Carolina Baptista Moreno Martin', 'Ana Carolina Ferreira Cardoso', 'Heloisa Sobreiro Selistre-de-Araujo', 'Márcia Regina Cominetti']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Adh Migr""","""['ADAM9 silencing inhibits breast tumor cell invasion in vitro.', 'The disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-9 mediate interactions between melanoma cells and fibroblasts.', 'Inhibition of platelets and tumor cell adhesion by the disintegrin domain of human ADAM9 to collagen I under dynamic flow conditions.', 'The pleiotropic roles of ADAM9 in the biology of solid tumors.', 'ADAM-15 disintegrin-like domain structure and function.', 'Visualization of integrin molecules by fluorescence imaging and techniques.', 'The Clinical Significance and Mechanisms of REG4 in Human Cancers.', 'Expression of ADAMTS13 in Normal and Abnormal Placentae and Its Potential Role in Angiogenesis and Placenta Development.', 'Fine Tuning Cell Migration by a Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases.', 'ADAMTS13: more than a regulator of thrombosis.']"""

Methods:   A cohort of 2493 men belonging to the EUREKA-2 retrospective multicentric database on (PCa) and treated with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as primary treatment comprised the study population (median follow-up 50 months). A Cox regression time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive power of %PC, both in univariate and multivariate settings, with age, pretreatment PSA, clinical-radiological staging, bioptic Gleason Score (bGS), RT dose and RT +/- ADT as covariates.  Results:   P statistics for %PC is lower than 0.001 both in univariate and multivariate models. %PC as a continuous variable yields an AUC of 69% in ROC curve analysis for biochemical relapse. Four classes of %PC (1-20%, 21-50%, 51-80% and 81-100%) distinctly split patients for risk of biochemical relapse (overall log-rank test P<0.0001), with biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) at 5-years ranging from 88% to 58% and 10-years bPFS ranging from 80% to 38%.  Conclusions:   We strongly affirm the usefulness of %PC information beyond main risk factors (PSA, staging and bGS) in predicting biochemical recurrence after EBRT for PCa. The stratification of patients according to %PC may be valuable to further discriminate cases with favourable or adverse prognosis.""","""['Domenico Gabriele', 'Monica Garibaldi', 'Giuseppe Girelli', 'Stefano Taraglio', 'Eleonora Duregon', 'Pietro Gabriele', 'Caterina Guiot', 'Enrico Bollito;CONSORTIUM THE EUREKA']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Panminerva Med""","""[""Beyond D'Amico risk classes for predicting recurrence after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the Candiolo classifier."", 'Association of percent positive prostate biopsies and perineural invasion with biochemical outcome after external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Effect of obesity on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer as measured by the 2006 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-American Society for Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology (RTOG-ASTRO) Phoenix consensus definition.', 'Clinical utility of percent-positive prostate biopsies in predicting biochemical outcome after radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.']"""
