Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), the accelerated hybridization between two DNA hairpins catalyzed by a DNA input, is one of the most widely studied and used CDCs for amplified detection of nucleic acids and small molecules. So far, it is still challenging to expand CHAs to proteins largely due to the lack of a universal strategy to construct protein-responsive CHAs. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that a rationally designed protein-DNA binding complex can be used as an effective catalyst to accelerate CHA reactions. On the basis of this principle, we developed specific CHAs for a number of important protein biomarkers, including human α-thrombin, human prostate specific antigen, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Upon establishing this panel of protein-responsive CHAs, we further explore their potential applications to the detection of specific protein biomarkers from human serum samples and cancer cells.""","""['Yanan Tang', 'Yanwen Lin', 'Xiaolong Yang', 'Zhixin Wang', 'X Chris Le', 'Feng Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Catalytic Hairpin Assembly-Programmed DNA Three-Way Junction for Enzyme-Free and Amplified Electrochemical Detection of Target DNA.', 'l-DNA-Based Catalytic Hairpin Assembly Circuit.', 'Target DNA- and pH-responsive DNA hydrogel-based capillary assay for the optical detection of short SARS-CoV-2 cDNA.', 'Peroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes for biosensing applications: a review.', 'DNAzymes for sensing, nanobiotechnology and logic gate applications.', 'Engineering of catalytic hairpin-rigidified Y-shaped DNA-functionalized nanomachine to rapidly detect mRNA.', 'A Novel Fluorescent Aptamer Sensor with DNAzyme Signal Amplification for the Detection of CEA in Blood.', 'Prospects and challenges of dynamic DNA nanostructures in biomedical applications.', 'Amplified detection of nucleic acids and proteins using an isothermal proximity CRISPR Cas12a assay.', 'Nucleic-Acid Driven Cooperative Bioassays Using Probe Proximity or Split-Probe Techniques.']"""

The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate.

A PSM can influence local recurrence and outcomes after salvage radiation. Unlike intrinsic risk factors, a PSM is caused by intervention and thus iatrogenic failures may be elucidated by analyzing margin laterality as surgical approach is itself lateralized.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed 226 RP patients between 1991 and 2013 with PSM. Data includes operation type, pre/postoperative PSA, surgical pathology, and margin type (location, focality, laterality). The median follow-up was 47 months. Biochemical recurrence after RP was defined as PSA≥0.1 ng/mL or 2 consecutive rises above nadir. Ninety-two patients received salvage radiation therapy (SRT). Failure after SRT was defined as any PSA≥0.2 ng/mL or greater than presalvage. Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate analyses compared relapse rates.  Results:   The majority of PSM were iatrogenic (58%). Laterality was associated with differences in median relapse: right 20 versus left 51 versus bilateral 14 months (P<0.01). Preoperative PSA, T-stage, Gleason grade, and laterality were associated with biochemical progression on univariate and multivariate analyses. Right-sided margins were more likely to progress than left (hazard ratio, 1.67; P=0.04). More right-sided margins were referred for SRT (55% right vs. 23% left vs. 22% bilateral), but were equally salvaged. Only T-stage and pre-SRT PSA independently influenced SRT success.  Conclusions:   Most PSM are iatrogenic, with right-sided more likely to progress (and sooner) than left sided. Margin laterality is a heretofore unrecognized independent predictor of biochemical relapse and hints at the need to modify the traditional unilateral surgical technique.""","""['Jung J Kang', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Nicolas Kummer', 'Jean DeKernion', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Prognostic Value of Gleason Score at Positive Surgical Margin in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Both somatic and germline mutations have been implicated to cause prostate cancer. With an array of available Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data on dbSNP this study is designed to sort out functional SNPs in RNASEL by implementing different authentic computational tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen, SNPs&GO, Fathmm, ConSurf, UTRScan, PDBsum, Tm-Align, I-Mutant, and Project HOPE for functional and structural assessment, solvent accessibility, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization study. Among 794 RNASEL SNP entries 124 SNPs were found nonsynonymous from which SIFT predicted 13 nsSNPs as nontolerable whereas PolyPhen-2 predicted 28. SNPs found on the 3' and 5' UTR were also assessed. By analyzing six tools having different perspectives an aggregate result was produced where nine nsSNPs were found to be most likely to exert deleterious effect. 3D models of mutated proteins were generated to determine the functional and structural effect of the mutations on ribonuclease L. The initial findings were reinforced by the results from I-Mutant and Project HOPE as these tools predicted significant structural and functional instability of the mutated proteins. Expasy-ProSit tool defined the mutations to be situated in the functional domains of the protein. Considering previous analysis this study revealed a conclusive result deducing the available SNP data on the database by identifying the most damaging three nsSNP rs151296858 (G59S), rs145415894 (A276V), and rs35896902 (R592H).

Patients and methods:   We identified 37 501 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1988 and 2001 treated with radical prostatectomy within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The primary study variables were tumour size by largest dimension (stratified into: (i) microscopic focus only or 1 mm; (ii) 2-15 mm; (iii) 16-30 mm; (iv) >30 mm), regional LN involvement, and the corresponding interaction term. We evaluated the risk of 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) using the Fine and Gray model for competing risks after controlling for race, tumour grade, T stage, receipt of radiation, number of dissected LNs, number of positive LNs, year of diagnosis, and age at diagnosis.  Results:   The median follow-up was 11.8 years. There was a significant interaction between tumour size and LN involvement (P-interaction <0.001). In the absence of LN involvement (36 561 patients), the risk of 10-year PCSM increased monotonically with increasing tumour size. Among patients with LN involvement (940), those with the smallest tumours had increased 10-year PCSM compared with patients with tumours sized 2-15 mm (24.7% vs 11.8%; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-6.71; P = 0.017) or 16-30 mm (24.7% vs 15.5%; AHR 3.12, 95% CI 1.51-6.49; P = 0.002), and similar 10-year PCSM as those with tumours >30 mm (24.7% vs 24.9%; P = 0.156).  Conclusion:   In patients with prostate cancer with LN involvement, very small tumour size may predict for higher PCSM compared with some larger tumours, even after controlling for other prognostic variables.

We found that the AR and the E2F/RB pathway dynamically regulate distinct post-transcriptional and post-translational isoforms of PEG10 at distinct stages of NEPC development. In vitro, PEG10 promoted cell-cycle progression from G0/G1 in the context of TP53 loss and regulated Snail expression via TGF-β signaling to promote invasion.

The partition coefficient of (+)-[(211)At]pAtV was measured. Cellular uptake experiments and in vivo biodistribution experiments were performed using a mixed solution of (+)-[(211)At]pAtV and (+)-[(125)I]pIV; the human prostate cancer cell line DU-145, which expresses high levels of the sigma receptors, and DU-145 tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   The lipophilicity of (+)-[(211)At]pAtV was similar to that of (+)-[(125)I]pIV. DU-145 cellular uptake and the biodistribution patterns in DU-145 tumor-bearing mice at 1h post-injection were also similar between (+)-[(211)At]pAtV and (+)-[(125)I]pIV.

Methods and materials:   Fourteen men with prostate cancer who were candidates for brachytherapy as sole treatment were prospectively enrolled. Treatment planning goal was to escalate the tumor dose to 200% with a modest de-escalation of dose to remaining prostate compared with our standard. Primary end points included technical feasibility of TTI-guided brachytherapy and equivalent or better toxicity compared with standard brachytherapy. Secondary end points included dose escalation to tumor regions and de-escalated dose to nontumor regions on the preimplant plan, negative prostate biopsy at 2 years, and freedom from biochemical failure.  Results:   Thirteen of fourteen men successfully completed the TTI-guided brachytherapy procedure for a feasibility rate of 93%. A software malfunction resulted in switching one patient from TTI-guided to standard brachytherapy. An average of 2.7 foci per patient was demonstrated and treated with an escalated dose. Dosimetric goals on preplan were achieved. One patient expired from unrelated causes 65 days after brachytherapy. Toxicity was at least as low as standard brachytherapy. Two-year prostate biopsies were obtained from six men; five (83%) were definitively negative, one showed evidence of disease with treatment effect, and none were positive. No patients experienced biochemical recurrence after a median followup of 31.5 (24-52) months.

Looking for an improved [Formula: see text], increased near-maximum target dose (D2%) and prostate-rectum spacer insertion were tested.  Methods:   For 11 patients, two VMAT plans, with D2% ≤ 37.5 Gy (Hom) or D2% ≤ 40.2 Gy (Het), on each of two CT studies, before or after spacer insertion, were computed.

Therefore, novel strategies that can overcome these limitations are urgently needed. We made a novel discovery that fisetin, a hydroxyflavone, is a microtubule stabilizing agent. Fisetin binds to tubulin and stabilizes microtubules with binding characteristics far superior than paclitaxel. Surface plasmon resonance and computational docking studies suggested that fisetin binds to β-tubulin with superior affinity compared to paclitaxel. Fisetin treatment of human prostate cancer cells resulted in robust up-regulation of microtubule associated proteins (MAP)-2 and -4. In addition, fisetin treated cells were enriched in α-tubulin acetylation, an indication of stabilization of microtubules. Fisetin significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Nudc, a protein associated with microtubule motor dynein/dynactin complex that regulates microtubule dynamics, was inhibited with fisetin treatment. Further, fisetin treatment of a P-glycoprotein overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cell line NCI/ADR-RES inhibited the viability and colony formation. Our results offer in vitro proof-of-concept for fisetin as a microtubule targeting agent.

Several studies have indicated a possible relation between low testosterone levels and QT interval prolongation.  Objectives:   To compare the QT interval length in elderly patients with prostate carcinoma who were on anti-testosterone treatment and those who were not.  Methods:   We screened the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 100 prostate cancer patients divided into two groups: 50 patients on anti-testosterone drug treatment and 50 patients not. QT interval length was measured according to the accepted methods.  Results:   The mean QTc 12 leads in the entire group was 0.45 ± 0.04 sec, which is close to the upper limit. Mean QTc was actually longer in the control group and there was no QTc difference between the groups after adjustment for possible confounders. Prolonged QTc 12-lead ECG (48% in treated and 54% in non-treated) and lead L2 QT interval (50% in treated and 56% in non-treated) did not differ significantly between the groups. The analysis of QTc 12-lead ECG indicated no significant effects of anti-testosterone drug treatment. Only the use of furosemide was associated with QT prolongation.  Conclusions:   The results of this preliminary study do not support our initial concern of an alarmingly prolonged QT interval in the anti-testosterone treated group.

However, the value for SK is dispersed: this dispersion is not only due to the manufacturing process and variation between different source batches but also due to the classification of sources into different classes according to their SK values. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of SK dispersion on typical implant parameters that are used to evaluate the dose volume histogram (DVH) for both planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs).  Methods:   The authors have developed a new algorithm to compute dose distributions with different SK values for each source. Three different prostate volumes (20, 30, and 40 cm(3)) were considered and two typical commercial sources of different radionuclides were used. Using a conventional TPS, clinically accepted calculations were made for (125)I sources; for the palladium, typical implants were simulated. To assess the many different possible SK values for each source belonging to a class, the authors assigned an SK value to each source in a randomized process 1000 times for each source and volume. All the dose distributions generated for each set of simulations were assessed through the DVH distributions comparing with dose distributions obtained using a uniform SK value for all the implanted sources. The authors analyzed several dose coverage (V100 and D90) and overdosage parameters for prostate and PTV and also the limiting and overdosage parameters for OARs, urethra and rectum.  Results:   The parameters analyzed followed a Gaussian distribution for the entire set of computed dosimetries. PTV and prostate V100 and D90 variations ranged between 0.2% and 1.78% for both sources. Variations for the overdosage parameters V150 and V200 compared to dose coverage parameters were observed and, in general, variations were larger for parameters related to (125)I sources than (103)Pd sources. For OAR dosimetry, variations with respect to the reference D0.1cm(3) were observed for rectum values, ranging from 2% to 3%, compared with urethra values, which ranged from 1% to 2%.  Conclusions:   Dose coverage for prostate and PTV was practically unaffected by SK dispersion, as was the maximum dose deposited in the urethra due to the implant technique geometry. However, the authors observed larger variations for the PTV V150, rectum V100, and rectum D0.1cm(3) values. The variations in rectum parameters were caused by the specific location of sources with SK value that differed from the average in the vicinity. Finally, on comparing the two sources, variations were larger for (125)I than for (103)Pd. This is because for (103)Pd, a greater number of sources were used to obtain a valid dose distribution than for (125)I, resulting in a lower variation for each SK value for each source (because the variations become averaged out statistically speaking).""","""['E Nuñez-Cumplido', 'J Perez-Calatayud', 'O Casares-Magaz', 'J Hernandez-Armas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy boost treatments for localized prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between real-time intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry and its implications on intraoperative planning.', 'High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy consistently results in high quality dosimetry.', 'The impact of technological advances on the evolution of 3D conformal brachytherapy for early prostate cancer.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.']"""

The degree of equivalence of the corrected CBCT images with respect to the reference CT image (CTref) was evaluated by using angular profiles of water equivalent path length (WEPL) and passively scattered proton treatment plans. The CBCTap was further evaluated in more realistic scenarios such as rectal filling and weight loss to assess the effect of mismatched prior information on the corrected images.  Results:   The uncorrected CBCT and CBCTus images demonstrated substantial WEPL discrepancies (7.3 ± 5.3 mm and 11.1 ± 6.6 mm, respectively) with respect to the CTref, while the CBCTap images showed substantially reduced WEPL errors (2.4 ± 2.0 mm). Similarly, the CBCTap-based treatment plans demonstrated a high pass rate (96.0% ± 2.5% in 2 mm/2% criteria) in a 3D gamma analysis.  Conclusions:   A priori CT-based scatter correction technique was shown to be promising for adaptive proton therapy, as it achieved equivalent proton dose distributions and water equivalent path lengths compared to those of a reference CT in a selection of anthropomorphic phantoms.""","""['Yang-Kyun Park', 'Gregory C Sharp', 'Justin Phillips', 'Brian A Winey']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Investigating deformable image registration and scatter correction for CBCT-based dose calculation in adaptive IMPT.', 'Modified fast adaptive scatter kernel superposition (mfASKS) correction and its dosimetric impact on CBCT-based proton therapy dose calculation.', 'Evaluation of CBCT scatter correction using deep convolutional neural networks for head and neck adaptive proton therapy.', 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'Clinical evaluation of synthetic computed tomography methods in adaptive proton therapy of lung cancer patients.', 'A systematic review of volumetric image guidance in proton therapy.', 'Deep learning based synthetic CT from cone beam CT generation for abdominal paediatric radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric impact of adaptive proton therapy in head and neck cancer - A review.', 'Deep learning-based 4D-synthetic CTs from sparse-view CBCTs for dose calculations in adaptive proton therapy.']"""

Engaging the community in research affords opportunities to build capacity for teaching and raising awareness. Approach and Strategies A community steering committee of academicians, community partners, religious leaders, and other stakeholders modified a curriculum on prostate health and screening to include interactive knowledge- and skill-building activities. This curriculum was then used to train 15 African American lay health advisors, dubbed Prostate Cancer Ambassadors, in a rural NC community. Over the 2-day training, Ambassadors achieved statistically significant improvements in knowledge of prostate health and maintained confidence in teaching. The Ambassadors, in turn, used their personal networks to share their knowledge with over 1,000 individuals in their community. Finally, the Ambassadors became researchers, implementing a prostate health survey in local churches. Discussion and Conclusions It is feasible to use community engagement models for raising awareness of prostate health in NC African American communities. Mobilizing community coalitions to develop curricula ensures that the curricula meet the communities' needs, and training lay health advisors to deliver curricula helps secure community buy-in for the information.""","""['Anissa I Vines', 'Jaimie C Hunter', 'Brandolyn S White', 'Alan N Richmond']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Health Promot Pract""","""['Prostate Cancer Ambassadors: Enhancing a Theory-Informed Training Program for Informed Decision-Making.', 'Word on the Street: Engaging Local Leaders in a Dialogue About Prostate Cancer Among African Americans.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', ""What lay health advisors do: An evaluation of advisors' activities."", 'The Save our Sisters Project.

Spatial sparing of the rectum can be achieved by introducing a spacer material into the retroprostatic space, thus separating the anterior rectal wall from the PTV.  Materials and methods:   Two spacer technologies, Spacer OAR, a polyethylene glycol gel and ProSpace, a saline inflated balloon, were compared in terms of spacer volume, stability, and dose reduction to the anterior rectum wall in 78 patients.  Results:   Both spacer systems significantly reduced the rectum surface encompassed by the 95% isodose (gel: -35%, p<0.01; balloon -63.4%, p<0.001) compared to a control group. The balloon spacer was superior in reducing rectum dose (-27.7%, p=0.034), but exhibited an average volume loss of >50% during the full course of treatment of 37-40 fractions, while the volume of gel spacers remained fairly constant.

A Cohort Study Over a 1-Year Period""","""Introduction:   Prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in clinical practice to detect clinically significant prostate cancer, although its role is controversial. We audited the accuracy of prebiopsy MRI for men clinically suspected to have prostate cancer who underwent initial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy at our institution.  Patients and methods:   All patients who had a prebiopsy prostate MRI and initial TRUS prostate biopsy from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 were included in the study. Prostate MRI was performed using a 1.5-T machine with T2 and diffusion weighted imaging axial phase. TRUS prostate biopsy was performed using a monoplane ultrasound machine. Systematic 12-core prostate biopsies were taken with a Tru-Cut biopsy needle from the apex, middle, and base of the left and right lobe.  Results:   One hundred seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria; 128 (74.4%) patients had a lesion detected on MRI and 114 (66.3%) patients had a positive biopsy. The sensitivity of MRI for significant prostate cancer on TRUS biopsy of the prostate was 83.5%, specificity was 35.2%, positive predictive value was 55%, and negative predictive value was 68.9%. A positive MRI scan was significantly associated with significant prostate cancer diagnosis, and higher National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification (P ≤ .001). MRI detected 62 of 63 NCCN high-risk and 18 of 18 Gleason score 8 to 10 cases.  Conclusion:   The sensitivity and specificity of MRI appears insufficient to avoid TRUS biopsy in all men clinically suspected to have prostate cancer. Standardized MRI reporting and robust prospective studies are needed to define the role of prebiopsy MRI in this setting. For patients at risk of complications from biopsy, a negative MRI scan might be used to exclude high-risk disease.""","""['Benjamin W Lamb', 'Wei Shen Tan', 'Attia Rehman', 'Afsara Nessa', 'Daniel Cohen', ""John O'Neil"", 'James S A Green', 'John E W Hines']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['High diagnostic ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect anterior prostate cancer missed by transrectal 12-core biopsy.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'In patients with a previous negative prostate biopsy and a suspicious lesion on magnetic resonance imaging, is a 12-core biopsy still necessary in addition to a targeted biopsy?', 'Prediagnostic Risk Assessment with Prostate MRI and MRI-Targeted Biopsy.', 'Role of MRI prebiopsy in men at risk for prostate cancer: taking off the blindfold.', 'Can a prostate biopsy be safely deferred on PI-RADS 1,2 or 3 lesions seen on pre-biopsy mp-MRI?', 'Efficacy of additional periprostatic apex nerve block on pain in each of 12 transrectal prostate core biopsies: a retrospective study.', 'Accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing prostate Cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Imaging Predicting Intraprostatic Tumor Extent, Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion Prior to Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'What Are We Missing?

These PAFP LNs rarely harbor metastatic disease, and the characteristics of patients with PAFP LN metastasis are not well-described in the literature. Our previous study suggested that metastatic disease to the PAFP LN was associated with less severe oncologic outcomes than those that involve the pelvic lymph node (PLN). Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the oncologic outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) patients with PAFP LN metastasis in a larger patient population.  Methods:   Data were analyzed on 8800 patients from eleven international centers in three countries. Eighty-eight patients were found to have metastatic disease to the PAFP LNs (PAFP+) and 206 men had isolated metastasis to the pelvic LNs (PLN+). Clinicopathologic features were compared using ANOVA and Chi square tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the time to biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Of the eighty-eight patients with PAFP LN metastasis, sixty-three (71.6%) were up-staged based on the pathologic analysis of PAFP and eight (9.1%) had a low-risk disease. Patients with LNs present in the PAFP had a higher incidence of biopsy Gleason score (GS) 8-10, pathologic N1 disease, and positive surgical margin in prostatectomy specimens than those with no LNs detected in the PAFP. Men who were PAFP+ with or without PLN involvement had more aggressive pathologic features than those with PLN disease only. However, there was no significant difference in BCR-free survival regardless of adjuvant therapy. In 300 patients who underwent PAFP LN mapping, 65 LNs were detected. It was also found that 44 out of 65 (67.7%) nodes were located in the middle portion of the PAFP.  Conclusions:   There was no significant difference in the rate of BCR between the PAFP LN+ and PLN+ groups. The PAFP likely represents a landing zone that is different from the PLNs for PCa metastasis. Therefore, the removal and pathologic analysis of PAFP should be adopted as a standard procedure in all patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.""","""['Young Suk Kwon', 'Yun-Sok Ha', 'Parth K Modi', 'Amirali Salmasi', 'Jaspreet S Parihar', 'Neal Patel', 'Izak Faiena', 'Michael May', 'David I Lee', 'Elton Llukani', 'Tuliao Patrick', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Thomas Ahlering', 'Douglas Skarecky', 'Hanjong Ahn', 'Seung-Kwon Choi', 'Sejun Park', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Yen-Chuan Ou', 'Daniel Eun', 'Varsha Manucha', 'David Albala', 'Ketan Badani', 'Bertram Yuh', 'Nora Ruel', 'Tae-Hwan Kim', 'Tae Gyun Kwon', 'Daniel Marchalik', 'Jonathan Hwang', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Pathological analysis of the prostatic anterior fat pad at radical prostatectomy: insights from a prospective series.', 'Pathologic implications of prostatic anterior fat pad.', 'Detailed analysis of patients with metastasis to the prostatic anterior fat pad lymph nodes: a multi-institutional study.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Update on histopathological evaluation of lymphadenectomy specimens from prostate cancer patients.', 'Identification of Novel Prognosis and Prediction Markers in Advanced Prostate Cancer Tissues Based on Quantitative Proteomics.', 'Impact of prostatic anterior fat pads with lymph node staging in prostate cancer.', 'Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening.']"""

Silence of RNF31 suppressed PCa cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. miR-503 can directly regulate RNF31. Enforced expression of miR-503 inhibited the expression of RNF31 significantly and the restoration of RNF31 expression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-503 on PCa cell proliferation and metastasis.

Results:   Grade IV glioma was associated with higher levels of kallikrein-immunostaining compared to grade III specimens. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that elevated KLK6- or KLK7-IR was associated with poor patient prognosis. In addition, an increased percent of tumor immunoreactive for KLK6 or KLK9 was associated with decreased survival in grade IV patients.

The HGF gene encodes full-length hHGF and two truncated isoforms known as NK1 and NK2. NK1 induces all three HGF activities at modestly reduced potency, whereas NK2 stimulates only motogenesis and enhances HGF-driven tumor metastasis in transgenic mice. Prior studies have shown that mouse HGF (mHGF) also binds with high affinity to human MET.

Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) activity has been shown to be increased in various cancer types and proposed as a prognostic parameter. Aim of the present study was to investigate TK1 in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC).  Methods:   Corresponding UC and benign samples from paraffin embedded tissue of 111 patients treated with cystectomy for invasive UC from 1996 to 2006 were immunohistochemically (IHC) assessed for TK1. IHC expression patterns were evaluated in a semiquantitative fashion by 2 independent reviewers. Localization of staining was categorized into pure nuclear and additional cytoplasmic localization. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to assess differential expression in normal and UC tissue and to evaluate the diagnostic and predictive capability of TK1 by correlation to clinical data. To correlate TK1 expression with molecular subtypes of UC, analysis of TK1 RNA expression levels of the Cancer Genome Atlas UC cohort was performed.  Results:   TK1 was significantly overexpressed in invasive UC, compared to benign urothelium (P<0.0001), and cytoplasmic expression was more often found in cancer tissue than in benign tissue (P = 0.0001). No correlations of TK1 protein expression patterns to standard histopathological determinants were detected. In univariate analysis, TK1 nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was associated with improved cancer-specific survival (P = 0.0119). However, only metastasis status and histologic grade were identified as independent predictors of cancer-specific survival in multivariate analysis. TK1 expression was merely found in the basal layers of benign urothelium. RNA overexpression of TK1 could be correlated to the biologically more aggressive basal UC subtype.

To better address the utility of SAT, prospective clinical trials must address the aspects of accepted standards in the initial evaluation, treatment, follow-up, and outcomes in the oncology community. We undertook this study to achieve consensus on uniform standardized trial design for SAT trials.  Methods:   A literature search was performed and an international multidisciplinary group of experts was identified. A questionnaire was constructed and sent out to 71 participants in 3 consecutive rounds according to the Delphi method. The project was concluded with a face-to-face meeting in which the results were reviewed and conclusions were formulated.  Results:   Patients with recurrent disease after radiation therapy were considered candidates for a SAT trial using any ablation scenario performed with cryotherapy or high-intensity focused ultrasound. It is feasible to compare different sources of energy or to compare with historical data on salvage radical prostatectomy outcomes. The primary objective should be to assess the efficacy of the treatment for negative biopsy rate at 12 months. Secondary objectives should include safety parameters and quality-of-life assessment. Exclusion criteria should include evidence of local or distant metastases. The optimal biopsy strategy is image-guided targeted biopsies. Follow-up includes multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, prostate-specific antigen level, and quality of life for at least 5 years.  Conclusions:   A multidisciplinary board from international experts reached consensus on trial design for SAT in prostate cancer and provides a standard for designing a feasible SAT trial.""","""['Willemien van den Bos', 'Berrend G Muller', 'Daniel M de Bruin', 'Andre Luis de Castro Abreu', 'Christian Chaussy', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Sjoerd F M Jenniskens', 'Frank Kahmann', 'M Pilar Laguna-Pes', 'Ardeshir R Rastinehad', 'Lucy A Simmons', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Arnauld Villers', 'John F Ward', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Focal therapy in prostate cancer: international multidisciplinary consensus on trial design.', 'Intraprostatic Cancer Recurrence following Radical Radiotherapy on Transperineal Template Mapping Biopsy: Implications for Focal Ablative Salvage Therapy.', 'Standardized Nomenclature and Surveillance Methodologies After Focal Therapy and Partial Gland Ablation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Multidisciplinary Consensus.', 'Defining the index lesion for potential salvage partial or hemi-gland ablation after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility and safety of focal irreversible electroporation as salvage treatment for localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', ""A scoping review of core outcome sets and their 'mapping' onto real-world data using prostate cancer as a case study."", 'Salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer persistence after brachytherapy: repeated use of a polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacer.', 'Management Options for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Site-specific Recurrence Following Primary Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Using C-11 Choline Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography: A Nomogram for Predicting Extrapelvic Disease.']"""

Living with a cancer diagnosis may impose stress on both the men and their spouses. In this study we explore whether the scores of and verbal responses to a Health Literacy Questionnaire can be used to identify individuals in need of information and support and to reveal differences in perception and understanding in health related situations within couples.  Methods:   We used the nine-domain Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) as a framework to explore health literacy in eight couples where the men were on active surveillance for prostate cancer progression. Scores were calculated for each domain for both individuals. For each couple differences in scores were also calculated and related to the informants' self-reported experiences and reflections in relation to participating in an active surveillance program. Also an inductive analysis was performed to identify themes in the responses and these themes were compared to those of HLQ.  Results:   The men tended to score higher than their spouses. There was no consistent relation between scores and the reported experiences and reflections. However, some interesting patterns emerged, e.g. in two of the three couples with the largest within couple differences in HLQ scores, responses revealed discrepancies in how the men and their spouses perceived their situation. Also, three themes emerged which related to six of the HLQ domains, i.e. involvement of spouses and other people around the men; support from and interaction with healthcare professionals; and use of the Internet for information retrieval.  Conclusions:   Using the HLQ as an interview framework provided insight into the differences within couples and provided new perspectives on their experiences, including their contact with health professionals and the patient-spouse interaction when dealing with prostate cancer. The HLQ used as a dialogue tool may be an adjunct to assist healthcare providers to understand the need for support and information of men with prostate cancer on active surveillance and the dynamics within couples.""","""['Lars Kayser', 'Nete S Hansen-Nord', 'Richard H Osborne', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Rikke D Hansen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Couples surviving prostate cancer: Long-term intimacy needs and concerns following treatment.', 'The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) at the patient-clinician interface: a qualitative study of what patients and clinicians mean by their HLQ scores.', 'Health literacy and the health status of men with prostate cancer.', ""Developmental life stage and couples' experiences with prostate cancer: a review of the literature."", 'Sexual intimacy in heterosexual couples after prostate cancer treatment: What we know and what we still need to learn.', ""LGBTQI cancer patients' quality of life and distress: A comparison by gender, sexuality, age, cancer type and geographical remoteness."", 'The role of health literacy in cancer care: A mixed studies systematic review.', 'Improved cancer coping from a web-based intervention for prostate cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial.', 'Health literacy in cancer caregivers: a systematic review.', 'Exploring levels and correlates of health literacy in Arabic and Vietnamese immigrant patients with cancer and their English-speaking counterparts in Australia: a cross-sectional study protocol.']"""

In order to assess the role of HOOK3 in prostate cancer we analyzed HOOK3 expression by immunohistochemistry on a TMA containing more than 12,400 prostate cancers. Results were compared to tumor phenotype and PSA recurrence as well as aberrations possibly defining relevant molecular subtypes such as ERG status and deletions of 3p13, 5q21, 6q15 and PTEN. HOOK3 immunostaining was negative in normal luminal cells of prostate epithelium, whereas 53.3% of 10,572 interpretable cancers showed HOOK3 expression, which was considered low in 36.4% and high in 16.9% of cases. High-level HOOK3 expression was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason score, high proliferation index, positive lymph node stage, and PSA recurrence (p<0.0001 each). The prognostic role of HOOK3 expression was independent of established clinico-pathological parameters both in preoperative and postoperative settings. Comparisons with molecular features were performed to draw conclusions on the potential function of HOOK3 in the prostate. A strong association with all examined deletions is consistent with a role of HOOK3 for maintaining genomic integrity by contributing to proper centrosome assembly. Finding HOOK3 expression in 74% of ERG positive but in only 38% of ERG negative cancers (p<0.0001) further suggests functional interactions between these genes. In conclusion, the results of our study identify HOOK3 as a strong candidate prognostic marker with a possible role in maintaining genomic integrity in prostate cancer, which may have potential for inclusion into clinical routine assays.""","""['Nathaniel Melling', 'Levon Harutyunyan', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Martina Kluth', 'Ronald Simon', 'Patrick Lebok', 'Sarah Minner', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Christina Koop', 'Markus Graefen', 'Meike Adam', 'Alexander Haese', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Jakob Izbicki', 'Guido Sauter', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Till Krech']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'Expression of DNA ligase IV is linked to poor prognosis and characterizes a subset of prostate cancers harboring TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletion.', 'Cytoplasmic Accumulation of Sequestosome 1 (p62) Is a Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence, Rapid Tumor Cell Proliferation, and Genomic Instability in Prostate Cancer.', 'Reduced CD147 expression is linked to ERG fusion-positive prostate cancers but lacks substantial impact on PSA recurrence in patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Transcriptome analysis identification of A-to-I RNA editing in granulosa cells associated with PCOS.', 'Molecular subtyping and prognostic risk characterization of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma based on lysosome-related genes.', 'Identification of Novel Candidate Genes for Familial Thyroid Cancer by Whole Exome Sequencing.', 'Clinical relevance of RNA editing profiles in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Analysis of endometrial carcinoma TCGA reveals differences in DNA methylation in tumors from Black and White women.']"""

In this study we have estimated SC risks following RT with both previous and contemporary techniques, including proton therapy, using risk models based on different dose-response relationships.  Material and methods:   RT plans treating the prostate and seminal vesicles with either conformal radiotherapy (CRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were created for 10 patients. The risks of radiation-induced cancer were estimated for the bladder and rectum using dose-response models reflecting varying degrees of cell sterilisation: a linear model, a linear-plateau model and a bell-shaped model also accounting for fractionated RT.  Results:   The choice of risk models was found to rank the plans quite differently, with the CRT plans having the lowest SC risk using the bell-shaped model, while resulting in the highest risk applying the linear model. Considering all dose-response scenarios, median relative risks of VMAT versus IMPT were 1.1-1.7 for the bladder and 0.9-1.8 for the rectum. Risks of radiation-induced bladder and rectal cancers were lower from VMAT if exposed at 80 years versus IMPT if exposed at 50 years.  Conclusions:   The SC risk estimations for the bladder and rectum revealed no clear relative relationship between the contemporary techniques and CRT, with divergent results depending on choice of model. However, the SC risks for these organs when using IMPT were lower or comparable to VMAT. SC risks could be assessed when considering referral of prostate cancer patients to proton therapy, taking also general patient characteristics, such as age, into account.""","""['Camilla H Stokkevåg', 'Grete M Engeseth', 'Liv B Hysing', 'Kristian S Ytre-Hauge', 'Christian Ekanger', 'Ludvig P Muren']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The influence of inter-fractional anatomy variation on secondary cancer risk estimates following radiotherapy.', 'Modelling of organ-specific radiation-induced secondary cancer risks following particle therapy.', 'Modelling second malignancy risks from low dose rate and high dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Second neoplasms after percutaneous radiotherapy.', 'Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Estimation of the risk of secondary cancer in rectum and bladder after radiation therapy for prostate cancer using a feasibility dose-volume histogram.', 'CTSV (cathepsin V) promotes bladder cancer progression by increasing NF-κB activity.', 'Technical Note: validation of a material assignment method for a retrospective study of carbon-ion radiotherapy using Monte Carlo simulation.', 'VMAT for prostate cancer with 6-MV and 10-MV photons: Impact of beam energy on treatment plan quality and model-based secondary cancer risk estimates.', 'Urothelial Proliferation of Unknown Malignant Potential Involving the Bladder: Histopathologic Features and Risk of Progression in De Novo Cases and Cases With Prior Neoplasia.']"""

Thus far, there is no publicly available program for converting quantitative omics data into input formats to be used in off-the-shelf robust phylogenetic programs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on creation of two Windows-based programs, OmicsTract and SynpExtractor, to address this gap. We note, as a way of introduction and development of these programs, that one particularly useful bioinformatics inferential modeling is the phylogenetic cladogram. Cladograms are multidimensional tools that show the relatedness between subgroups of healthy and diseased individuals and the latter's shared aberrations; they also reveal some characteristics of a disease that would not otherwise be apparent by other analytical methods. The OmicsTract and SynpExtractor were written for the respective tasks of (1) accommodating advanced phylogenetic parsimony analysis (through standard programs of MIX [from PHYLIP] and TNT), and (2) extracting shared aberrations at the cladogram nodes. OmicsTract converts comma-delimited data tables through assigning each data point into a binary value (""0"" for normal states and ""1"" for abnormal states) then outputs the converted data tables into the proper input file formats for MIX or with embedded commands for TNT. SynapExtractor uses outfiles from MIX and TNT to extract the shared aberrations of each node of the cladogram, matching them with identifying labels from the dataset and exporting them into a comma-delimited file. Labels may be gene identifiers in gene-expression datasets or m/z values in mass spectrometry datasets. By automating these steps, OmicsTract and SynpExtractor offer a veritable opportunity for rapid and standardized phylogenetic analyses of omics data; their model can also be extended to next generation sequencing (NGS) data. We make OmicsTract and SynpExtractor publicly and freely available for non-commercial use in order to strengthen and build capacity for the phylogenetic paradigm of omics analysis.""","""['Jose Salazar', 'Hakima Amri', 'David Noursi', 'Mones Abu-Asab']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""OMICS""","""['Omics-Based Strategies in Precision Medicine: Toward a Paradigm Shift in Inborn Errors of Metabolism Investigations.', 'ASEQ: fast allele-specific studies from next-generation sequencing data.', 'Knowledge-guided analysis of ""omics"" data using the KnowEnG cloud platform.', 'MADMAX - Management and analysis database for multiple ~omics experiments.', ""Alzheimer's disease in the omics era."", 'The first imported case of melioidosis in a patient in central China.', 'Omics-Based Strategies in Precision Medicine: Toward a Paradigm Shift in Inborn Errors of Metabolism Investigations.', 'Study of Clinical Survival and Gene Expression in a Sample of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by Parsimony Phylogenetic Analysis.', 'A Systems Biology Interpretation of Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) Data through Phylogenetics.']"""

We report here that 2 μM WA induced cell death selectively in androgen-insensitive PC-3 and DU-145 prostate adenocarcinoma cells, whereas its toxicity was less severe in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells and normal human fibroblasts (TIG-1 and KD). WA also killed PC-3 cells in spheroid-forming medium. DNA microarray analysis revealed that WA significantly increased mRNA levels of c-Fos and 11 heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in PC-3 and DU-145, but not in LNCaP and TIG-1. Western analysis revealed increased expression of c-Fos and reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP(L). Expression of HSPs such as HSPA6 and Hsp70 was conspicuously elevated; however, because siRNA-mediated depletion of HSF-1, an HSP-inducing transcription factor, reduced PC-3 cell viability, it is likely that these heat-shock genes were involved in protecting against cell death. Moreover, WA induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PC-3 and DU-145, but not in normal fibroblasts. Immunocytochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy revealed that WA disrupted the vimentin cytoskeleton, possibly inducing the ROS generation, c-Fos expression and c-FLIP(L) suppression. These observations suggest that multiple events followed by disruption of the vimentin cytoskeleton play pivotal roles in WA-mediated cell death.""","""['Yukihiro Nishikawa', 'Daisuke Okuzaki', 'Kohshiro Fukushima', 'Satomi Mukai', 'Shouichi Ohno', 'Yuki Ozaki', 'Norikazu Yabuta', 'Hiroshi Nojima']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PAWR-mediated suppression of BCL2 promotes switching of 3-azido withaferin A (3-AWA)-induced autophagy to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cytoprotective autophagy induction by withaferin A in prostate cancer cells involves GABARAPL1.', 'Withaferin A induces Nrf2-dependent protection against liver injury: Role of Keap1-independent mechanisms.', 'Molecular insights into cancer therapeutic effects of the dietary medicinal phytochemical withaferin A.', 'Broad-spectrum antitumor properties of Withaferin A: a proteomic perspective.', 'Withaferin A: A Pleiotropic Anticancer Agent from the Indian Medicinal Plant Withania somnifera (L.)

We searched our institution's database for patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 PCa diagnosed on TRUS-guided biopsy who underwent subsequent RP between January 2010 and January 2015. Two blinded genitourinary pathologists independently reviewed and assessed the following on biopsies: (a) nuclear size, nucleolar size and distribution of macronucleoli of PCa, which were subjectively graded using a semi-quantitative scale from 1 to 3, and (b) PCa with cribriform morphology and the size of cribriform disease. Patient age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density (PSAD) were also recorded. The Gleason score and stage (presence or absence of organ-confined disease (OCD)) were retrieved from RP reports. Comparisons were performed between groups using the chi-square test and Spearman correlation. One hundred and four patients were identified to have met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 63 (±6.1) years. Mean PSA and PSAD at diagnosis were 7.5 (±4.2) and 0.25 (±0.15) ng/mL, respectively. Gleason scores were upgraded to greater than 3 + 4 = 7 in 26.9 % (28/104) of patients, and 44.2 % (46/104) of patients had no OCD after RP. There was no correlation between age, PSA, PSAD or percent of biopsies with Gleason pattern 4 for either Gleason score upgrading or absence of OCD at the time of RP (p > 0.05). Thirty patients had cribriform morphology on TRUS-guided biopsy of which 60 % (18/30) had no OCD at RP (p = 0.04) while 36.7 % (11/30) were upgraded to Gleason score ≥3 + 4 = 7 after RP (p = 0.15). There was no association between nuclear size, nucleolar size and/or distribution of macronucleoli with upgrading and/or absence of OCD (p > 0.05). The size of cribriform pattern was not associated with the absence of OCD (p = 0.43) or Gleason score upgrade (p = 0.28). A proportion of patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 PCa at needle biopsy do not have OCD or are upgraded to higher Gleason scores after RP. In our study, patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 PCa with the presence of cribriform pattern 4 had a significantly increased chance of being found to have no OCD at the time of RP.

We evaluated treatment patterns for older veterans with localized PCa, particularly those with low-risk features.  Methods:   We used VA Cancer Registry data to identify men aged 65+ diagnosed with clinically localized PCa between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st, 2008. We obtained baseline data on demographics, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, and initial treatment within 6 months of diagnosis: radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, primary androgen-deprivation therapy (PADT), or no active treatment. National VA surveys provided facility data, including academic affiliation, availability of oncologic specialists, and distance to radiotherapy facilities. Multinomial regression analyses determined associations between patient and facility characteristics and cancer treatment for men with localized (stage<III) and low-risk PCa (stage≤IIa, PSA<10ng/mL, Gleason ≤6).  Results:   17,206 veterans had localized PCa, 32% age 75+, 12% had comorbidity scores ≥3, and 33% had low-risk tumors. Overall, 39% received radiotherapy, 6% surgery, 20% PADT, and 35% no active treatment. For those with low-risk cancers, older men (RR=0.36, 95% CI 0.30-0.43) and sicker men (RR=0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90) were less likely to receive surgery or radiotherapy versus no active treatment. Over time, more of these men received no active treatment (from 41% to 57%, P<0.001) while fewer received PADT (from 11% to 4%, P<0.001).

However, there are no published data regarding the radiation dose given to the normal tissues. The aim of the present study was to estimate the pretreatment radiation doses in patients who will undergo radiometabolic therapy using a tracer amount of (177)Lu-labeled PSMA ligand.  Methods:   The study included seven patients with progressive prostate cancer with a mean age of 63.9 ± 3.9 years. All patients had prior PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and had intense tracer uptake at the lesions. The injected (177)Lu-PSMA-617 activity ranged from 185 to 210 MBq with a mean of 192.6 ± 11.0 MBq. To evaluate bone marrow absorbed dose 2-cc blood samples were withdrawn in short variable times (3, 15, 30, 60, and 180 min and 24, 48, and 120 h) after injection. Whole-body images were obtained at 4, 24, 48, and 120 h post-injection (p.i.). The geometric mean of anterior and posterior counts was determined through region of interest (ROI) analysis. Attenuation correction was applied using PSMA PET/CT images. The OLINDA/EXM dosimetry program was used for curve fitting, residence time calculation, and absorbed dose calculations.  Results:   The calculated radiation-absorbed doses for each organ showed substantial variation. The highest radiation estimated doses were calculated for parotid glands and kidneys. Calculated radiation-absorbed doses per megabecquerel were 1.17 ± 0.31 mGy for parotid glands and 0.88 ± 0.40 mGy for kidneys. The radiation dose given to the bone marrow was significantly lower than those of kidney and parotid glands (p < 0.05). The calculated radiation dose to bone marrow was 0.03 ± 0.01 mGy/MBq.  Conclusion:   Our first results suggested that (177)Lu-PSMA-617 therapy seems to be a safe method. The dose-limiting organ seems to be the parotid glands rather than kidneys and bone marrow.

Many factors that participate in the development of prostate cancer promote imbalance in the redox state of the cell. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species causes injury to cell structures, ultimately leading to cancer development. The antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1/HO-1) is responsible for the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis, playing a critical role in the oxidative stress and the regulation of prostate cancer development and progression. In the present study, the transcriptional regulation of HO-1 was investigated in prostate cancer. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 binds to the HO-1 promoter and modulates HO-1, inducing its protein levels through both the increment of its promoter activity and the induction of its transcriptional activation. In addition, in vitro and in vivo analyses show that BRCA1 also controls HO-1-negative targets: MMP9, uPA, and Cyclin D1. HO-1 transcriptional regulation is also modulated by oxidative and genotoxic agents. Induction of DNA damage by mitoxantrone and etoposide repressed HO-1 transcription, whereas hydrogen peroxide and doxorubicin induced its expression. Xenograft studies showed that HO-1 regulation by doxorubicin also occurs in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that BRCA1 overexpression and/or doxorubicin exposure induced the cytoplasmic retention of HO-1. Finally, the transcription factor NRF2 cooperates with BRCA1 protein to activate HO-1 promoter activity. In summary, these results show that the activation of BRCA1-NRF2/HO-1 axis defines a new mechanism for the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis in prostate cancer.  Implications:   Oxidative and genotoxic stress converge on HO-1 transcriptional activity through the combined actions of BRCA1 and NRF2.""","""['Estefanía Labanca', 'Paola De Luca', 'Geraldine Gueron', 'Alejandra Paez', 'Cristian P Moiola', 'Cintia Massillo', 'Juliana Porretti', 'Jimena Giudice', 'Florencia Zalazar', 'Nora Navone', 'Elba Vazquez', 'Adriana De Siervi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation via HO-1 activation underlies α-tocopheryl succinate toxicity.', 'Nrf2-heme oxygenase-1 axis in mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung: Antitumoral effects associated with down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases.', 'Rosmarinic acid up-regulates the noise-activated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and protects against noise-induced injury in rat cochlea.', 'Molecular mechanisms involved in enhancing HO-1 expression: de-repression by heme and activation by Nrf2, the ""one-two"" punch.', 'Oncogenic potential of Nrf2 and its principal target protein heme oxygenase-1.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploiting Interdata Relationships in Prostate Cancer Proteomes: Clinical Significance of HO-1 Interactors.', 'SIRT5 Promotes Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer by Suppressing DNA Damage in a ROS-Dependent Manner via Regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway.', 'Association between (GT)n Repeats in Heme Oxygenase-1 Gene Promoter and 3-Year Survival of Patients with Acute Leukemia: a Controlled, Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Oxidative stress and prostatic diseases.']"""

Here, we aimed to determine whether epigenetic events mediating the action of BPA on human prostaspheres enriched in epithelial stem-like/progenitor cells is linked to PCa. We performed genome-wide transcriptome and methylome analyses to identify changes in prostaspheres treated with BPA (10 nM, 200 nM, and 1000 nM) or estradiol-17β (E2) (0.1 nM) for 7 days and validated changes in expression, methylation, and histone marks in parallel-treated prostaspheres. BPA/E2-treatment altered expression of 91 genes but not the methylation status of 485,000 CpG sites in BPA/E2-treated prostaspheres. A panel of 26 genes was found repressed in all treatment groups. Fifteen of them were small nucleolar RNAs with C/D motif (SNORDs), which are noncoding, small nucleolar RNAs known to regulate ribosomal RNA assembly and function. Ten of the most down-regulated SNORDs were further studied. All 10 were confirmed repressed by BPA, but only 3 ratified as E2-repressed. SNORD suppression showed no correlation with methylation status changes in CpG sites in gene regulatory regions. Instead, BPA-induced gene silencing was found to associate with altered recruitments of H3K9me3, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 to 5'-regulatory/exonic sequences of 5 SNORDs. Expression of 4 out of these 5 SNORDs (SNORD59A, SNORD82, SNORD116, and SNORD117) was shown to be reduced in PCa compared with adjacent normal tissue.

The patients were subsequently categorized as having bone metastasis with or without a tumor mass, and statistically significant differences in median survival and 2-year overall survival were observed between these patients (the median survival and 2-year overall survival were respectively 3 months and 16% in patients with a tumor mass and 11 months and 26% in patients without a tumor mass; p<0.001).  Results:   According to multivariate analysis, the presence of bone metastasis with a tumor mass was found to be an independent prognostic factor (p=0.011, hazard ratio: 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.76). Bone metastasis with a tumor mass was more strongly associated with osteolytic lesions, other primary diseases (except for primary breast and prostate cancers), and spinal cord compression.  Conclusion:   Bone metastasis with a tumor mass is a strong and independent negative prognostic factor for survival in cancer patients.""","""['Birsen Yücel', 'Mustafa Gürol Celasun', 'Bilge Öztoprak', 'Zekiye Hasbek', 'Seher Bahar', 'Turgut Kaçan', 'Aykut Bahçeci', 'Mehmet Metin Şeker']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clinics (Sao Paulo)""","""['Evaluating the effects of mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic metastasis on vertebral bone quality in a new rat model.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Basic mechanisms responsible for osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases.', 'CD169(+) macrophages mediate pathological formation of woven bone in skeletal lesions of prostate cancer.', 'Notch3 promotes prostate cancer-induced bone lesion development via MMP-3.', 'Prognostic Significance of Bone Metastasis in Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients Receiving Palliative Systemic Therapy: An Explorative, Retrospective Pooled Analysis of the EORTC-Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) Database.', 'IMPROVED AGE- AND GENDER-SPECIFIC RADIATION RISK MODELS APPLIED ON COHORTS OF SWEDISH PATIENTS.', 'Clinicopathologic characteristics, metastasis-free survival, and skeletal-related events in 628 patients with skeletal metastases in a tertiary orthopedic and trauma center.', 'Paradoxical Role of Glypican-1 in Prostate Cancer Cell and Tumor Growth.', 'Survival Benefit for Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma Receiving Continuous Maintenance Chemotherapy.']"""

Disparities in cancer screening rates exist between American Indians/Alaska Natives and other racial/ethnic groups. Our study objectives were to examine prostate screening at 5 time points over a 12-year period among American Indian/Alaska Native men aged 50 to 75 years, and to compare their screening rates to African American men and white men in the same age group.  Methods:   We analyzed Health and Retirement Study data for 1996, 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2008. Prostate screening was measured by self-report of receipt of a prostate examination within the previous 2 years. Age-adjusted prevalence was estimated for each year. We used regression with generalized estimating equations to compare prostate screening prevalence by year and race.  Results:   Our analytic sample included 119 American Indian/Alaska Native men (n = 333 observations), 1,359 African American men (n = 3,704 observations), and 8,226 white men (n = 24,292 observations). From 1996 to 2008, prostate screening rates changed for each group: from 57.0% to 55.7% among American Indians/Alaska Natives, from 62.0% to 71.2% among African Americans, and from 68.6% to 71.3% among whites. Although the disparity between whites and African Americans shrank over time, it was virtually unchanged between whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives.  Conclusion:   As of 2008, American Indians/Alaska Natives were less likely than African Americans and whites to report a prostate examination within the previous 2 years. Prevalence trends indicated a modest increase in prostate cancer screening among African Americans and whites, while rates remained substantially lower for American Indians/Alaska Natives.""","""['R Turner Goins', 'Marc B Schure', 'Carolyn Noonan', 'Dedra Buchwald']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prev Chronic Dis""","""['State-specific prevalence of selected health behaviors, by race and ethnicity--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1997.', 'Psychiatric disorders and mental health treatment in American Indians and Alaska Natives: results of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.', 'Breastfeeding in Infancy Is Associated with Body Mass Index in Adolescence: A Retrospective Cohort Study Comparing American Indians/Alaska Natives and Non-Hispanic Whites.', 'Office of Management and Budget racial categories and implications for American Indians and Alaska Natives.', 'Health Disparities in Cancer Among American Indians and Alaska Natives.', 'Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Males.', 'Prostate cancer disparities among American Indians and Alaskan Natives in the United States.', 'Factors Associated with Cancer Screening Among Hopi Men.', 'Trends in Cancer Incidence Among American Indians and Alaska Natives and Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States, 1999-2015.', 'In search of Pan-American indigenous health and harmony.']"""

In the first part, we further investigate the PSA-/lo PCa cell population, which we have recently shown to harbor self-renewing long-term tumor-propagating cells and present several novel findings. We show that discordant AR and PSA expression in both untreated and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) results in AR+PSA+, AR+PSA-, AR-PSA-, and AR-PSA+ subtypes of PCa cells that manifest differential sensitivities to therapeutics. We further demonstrate that castration leads to a great enrichment of PSA-/lo PCa cells in both xenograft tumors and CRPC samples and systemic androgen levels dynamically regulate the relative abundance of PSA+ versus PSA-/lo PCa cells that impacts the kinetics of tumor growth. We also present evidence that the PSA-/lo PCa cells possess distinct epigenetic profiles. As the PSA-/lo PCa cell population is heterogeneous, in the second part, we employ two PSA- (Du145 and PC3) and two PSA+ (LAPC9 and LAPC4) PCa models as well as patient tumor cells to further dissect the clonogenic and tumorigenic subsets.

We showed that PAR-4 mRNA level is not significantly different between healthy and cancer ovarian cells. Immunohistochemistry on ovarian tissue showed that ovarian cancer cells are positive for PAR-4 nuclear and cytoplasmic staining whereas ovarian healthy cells are negative for PAR-4 nuclear staining. We then studied the role of PAR-4 in cell apoptosis. We determined that PAR-4 induces cell apoptosis in response to stimuli, in vitro, but is also involved in the relocation of GRP78 from endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface of ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3 cells). In ovo, PAR-4 decreases ovarian tumour development and increases the response to taxol treatment.

Methods:   Of the 367 patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer between February 2005 and March 2012 at Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, 344 patients whose follow-up period was more than 2 years were enrolled in this study.

We investigated whether cyclin D1 and p16 expression can inform on Rb functional status and distinguish small-cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma.  Experimental design:   We used gene expression data and immunohistochemistry to examine cyclin D1 and p16 levels in patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and prostatic small-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma specimens.  Results:   Using PDX, we show proof-of-concept that a high ratio of p16 to cyclin D1 gene expression reflects underlying Rb functional loss and distinguishes morphologically identified small-cell carcinoma from prostatic adenocarcinoma in patient specimens (n = 13 and 9, respectively). At the protein level, cyclin D1, but not p16, was useful to distinguish small-cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma. Overall, 88% (36/41) of small-cell carcinomas showed cyclin D1 loss by immunostaining compared with 2% (2/94) of Gleason score 7-10 primary adenocarcinomas at radical prostatectomy, 9% (4/44) of Gleason score 9-10 primary adenocarcinomas at needle biopsy, and 7% (8/115) of individual metastases from 39 patients at autopsy. Though rare adenocarcinomas showed cyclin D1 loss, many of these were associated with clinical features of small-cell carcinoma, and in a cohort of men treated with adjuvant ADT who developed metastasis, lower cyclin D1 gene expression was associated with more rapid onset of metastasis and death.

Methods:   For each patient, the rectum was outlined from anorectal junction to sigmoid colon, and rectal dose was parametrized using dose-volume (DVH), dose-surface (DSH) and dose-line (DLH) histograms. Generation of DLHs differed from previous studies in that the rectal dose was parametrized without first unwrapping onto 2-dimensional dose-surface maps. Patient-reported outcomes were collected using a validated Later Effects in Normal Tissues Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic questionnaire. Associations between dose and toxicity were assessed using a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test.  Results:   Associations (p < 0.05) were found between equieffective dose (EQD23) and late toxicity as follows: overall toxicity with DVH and DSH at 13-24 Gy; proctitis with DVH and DSH at 25-36 Gy and with DVH, DSH and DLH at 61-67 Gy; bowel urgency with DVH and DSH at 10-20 Gy. None of these associations met statistical significance following the application of a Bonferroni correction.  Conclusion:   Independently confirmed associations between rectal dose and late toxicity remain elusive. Future work to increase the accuracy of the knowledge of the rectal dose, either by accounting for interfraction and intrafraction rectal motion or via stabilization of the rectum during treatment, may be necessary to allow for improved dose-toxicity comparisons.

Zerumbone induced antiproliferative and apoptotic effects against PC-3 and DU-145, two human hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cell lines. Zerumbone inhibited microtubule assembly and induced an increase of MPM-2 expression (specific recognition of mitotic proteins). It also caused an increase of phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two key events in tubulin-binding effect, indicating tubulin-binding capability and mitotic arrest to zerumbone action. Furthermore, zerumbone induced several cellular effects distinct from tubulin-binding properties. First, zerumbone significantly increased, while paclitaxel (as a tubulin-binding control) decreased, Mcl-1 protein expression. Second, paclitaxel but not zerumbone induced Cdk1 activity. Third, zerumbone other than paclitaxel induced Cdc25C downregulation. The data suggest that, in addition to targeting tubulin/microtubule, zerumbone may act on other targets for signaling transduction. Zerumbone induced mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulation of GRP-78 and CHOP/GADD153 expression. Zerumbone induced an increase of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, a crosstalk marker between ER stress and mitochondrial insult, associated with the formation of active calpain I fragment. It induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent way and caused autophagy as evidenced by dramatic LC3-II formation.

Methods:   CBCT images were acquired using a novel 7 cm length image with standard exposure (1644 mAs) at Fraction 1 (7), standard 12 cm length image (1644 mAs) at Fraction 2 (12) and a 7 cm length image with higher exposure (2632 mAs) at Fraction 3 (7H) on 31 patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Eight observers (two clinicians and six radiographers) registered the images. Guidelines and training were provided. The means of the IOEs were compared using a Kruzkal-Wallis test. Levene's test was used to test for differences in the variances of the IOEs and the independent prostate position.  Results:   No significant difference was found between the IOEs of each image protocol in any direction. Mean absolute IOE was the greatest in the anteroposterior direction. Standard deviation (SD) of the IOE was the least in the left-right direction for each of the three image protocols. The SD of the IOE was significantly less than the independent prostate motion in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction only (1.8 and 3.0 mm, respectively: p = 0.017). IOEs were within 1 SD of the independent prostate motion in 95%, 77% and 96% of the images in the RL, SI and AP direction.  Conclusion:   Reducing CBCT scan length and increasing exposure did not have a significant effect on IOEs. To reduce imaging dose, a reduction in CBCT scan length could be considered without increasing the uncertainty in prostate registration. Precision of CBCT verification of prostate radiotherapy is affected by IOE and should be quantified prior to implementation.  Advances in knowledge:   This study shows the importance of quantifying the magnitude of IOEs prior to CBCT implementation.""","""['Helen A McNair', 'Emma J Harris', 'Vibeke N Hansen', 'Karen Thomas', 'Christopher South', 'Shaista Hafeez', 'Robert Huddart', 'David P Dearnaley']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'Analysis of interfraction prostate motion using megavoltage cone beam computed tomography.', 'Automatic prostate localization on cone-beam CT scans for high precision image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography imaging dose estimation and optimization: Need of daily cone-beam computed tomography.', 'A review of setup error in supine breast radiotherapy using cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'The accuracy of Magnetic Resonance - Cone Beam Computed Tomography soft-tissue matching for prostate radiotherapy.', 'A feasibility study to estimate optimal rigid-body registration using combinatorial rigid registration optimization (CORRO).', 'Comparison of prostate verification with implanted gold markers in tissue surrounding the prostate and pelvic bony anatomy for external beam radiation therapy following low-dose-rate brachytherapy: a prospective clinical trial.', 'Comparison of radiographer interobserver image registration variability using cone beam CT and MR for cervix radiotherapy.']"""

Growing numbers of prostate cancer survivors mean that this model of care may not be economically sustainable, and a number of alternative approaches have been suggested. The aim of this study was to develop an economic model to compare the costs of three alternative strategies for prostate cancer follow-up in Ireland-the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, the National Institute of Health Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and current practice.  Methods:   A cost minimisation analysis was performed using a Markov model with three arms (EAU guidelines, NICE guidelines and current practice) comparing follow-up for men with prostate cancer treated with curative intent. The model took a health care payer's perspective over a 10-year time horizon.  Results:   Current practice was the least cost efficient arm of the model, the NICE guidelines were most cost efficient (74 % of current practice costs) and the EAU guidelines intermediate (92 % of current practice costs). For the 2562 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2009, the Irish health care system could have saved €760,000 over a 10-year period if the NICE guidelines were adopted.  Conclusions:   This is the first study investigating costs of prostate cancer follow-up in the Irish setting.

We assessed whether concomitant treatment with ADT plus docetaxel would result in longer overall survival than that with ADT alone.  Methods:   We assigned men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to receive either ADT plus docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks for six cycles) or ADT alone. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that the median overall survival would be 33.3% longer among patients receiving docetaxel added to ADT early during therapy than among patients receiving ADT alone.  Results:   A total of 790 patients (median age, 63 years) underwent randomization. After a median follow-up of 28.9 months, the median overall survival was 13.6 months longer with ADT plus docetaxel (combination therapy) than with ADT alone (57.6 months vs. 44.0 months; hazard ratio for death in the combination group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). The median time to biochemical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression was 20.2 months in the combination group, as compared with 11.7 months in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001). The rate of a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.2 ng per milliliter at 12 months was 27.7% in the combination group versus 16.8% in the ADT-alone group (P<0.001). In the combination group, the rate of grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was 6.2%, the rate of grade 3 or 4 infection with neutropenia was 2.3%, and the rate of grade 3 sensory neuropathy and of grade 3 motor neuropathy was 0.5%.  Conclusions:   Six cycles of docetaxel at the beginning of ADT for metastatic prostate cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival than that with ADT alone.

We have used mass spectrometry metabolomic profiling, lipidomic profiling, bioinformatic and statistical methods to identify, quantify and characterize differentially regulated molecules in five prostate derived cell lines. We have identified potentially interesting species of different lipid subclasses including phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), glycerophosphoinositols (PIs) and other metabolites that are significantly upregulated in prostate cancer cells derived from distant metastatic sites. Transcriptomic and biochemical analysis of key enzymes that are involved in lipid metabolism demonstrate the significant upregulation of choline kinase alpha in the metastatic cells compared to the non-malignant and non-metastatic cells.

Based on DPT we have derived a Dual Processing Model (DPM) to describe and explain therapeutic medical decision-making. The DPM model indicates that doctors decide to treat when treatment benefits outweigh its harms, which occurs when the probability of the disease is greater than the so called ""threshold probability"" at which treatment benefits are equal to treatment harms. Here we extend our work to include a wider class of decision problems that involve diagnostic testing. We illustrate applicability of the proposed model in a typical clinical scenario considering the management of a patient with prostate cancer. To that end, we calculate and compare two types of decision-thresholds: one that adheres to expected utility theory (EUT) and the second according to DPM. Our results showed that the decisions to administer a diagnostic test could be better explained using the DPM threshold. This is because such decisions depend on objective evidence of test/treatment benefits and harms as well as type 1 cognition of benefits and harms, which are not considered under EUT. Given that type 1 processes are unique to each decision-maker, this means that the DPM threshold will vary among different individuals. We also showed that when type 1 processes exclusively dominate decisions, ordering a diagnostic test does not affect a decision; the decision is based on the assessment of benefits and harms of treatment. These findings could explain variations in the treatment and diagnostic patterns documented in today's clinical practice.""","""['Athanasios Tsalatsanis', 'Iztok Hozo', 'Ambuj Kumar', 'Benjamin Djulbegovic']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['When is rational to order a diagnostic test, or prescribe treatment: the threshold model as an explanation of practice variation.', 'Dual processing model of medical decision-making.', ""A regret theory approach to decision curve analysis: a novel method for eliciting decision makers' preferences and decision-making."", 'Using the Internet to calculate clinical action thresholds.', 'American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010.', 'Human-centered visualization technologies for patient monitoring are the future: a narrative review.', 'How do aged-care staff feel about antimicrobial stewardship?

The authors take advantage of text mining and reinforcement learning approaches to establish protein interaction network. Considering the high computational efficiency of co-occurrence-based interaction extraction approaches and high precision of linguistic patterns approaches, the authors propose an interaction extracting algorithm where they utilise frequently used linguistic patterns to extract the interactions from texts and then find out interactions from extended unprocessed texts under the basic idea of co-occurrence approach, meanwhile they discount the interaction extracted from extended texts. They put forward a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to establish a protein interaction network, where nodes represent proteins and edges denote interactions. During the evolutionary process, a node selects another node and the attained reward determines which predicted interaction should be reinforced. The topology of the network is updated by the agent until an optimal network is formed. They used texts downloaded from PubMed to construct a prostate cancer protein interaction network by the proposed methods. The results show that their method brought out pretty good matching rate.

Analysis included 18 prospective cohort studies conducted during 1963-2006 across 6 countries in southern and eastern Asia that are part of the Asia Cohort Consortium.

Various lifestyle factors have been examined in relation to prostate cancer risk, including diet, obesity, and physical activity; however, none of them has been consistently related to risk. In the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we investigated whether lifestyle-related factors are associated with prostate cancer risk and whether such factors explain the racial/ethnic differences in risk.  Methods:   During a mean follow-up of 13.9 years, 7,115 incident cases were identified among 75,216 white, African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and Latino men. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for prostate cancer.  Results:   Among selected lifestyle-related factors including body mass index, height, education, physical activity, and intakes of alcohol, calcium, legumes, lycopene, and selenium, only smoking (RR for current (≥20 cigarettes/day) vs. never smoking = 0.72; 95 % CI 0.63-0.83) and history of diabetes (RR for yes vs. no = 0.78; 95 % CI 0.72-0.85) were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. Compared to whites, the risk of incident prostate cancer was twofold higher in African-Americans and 16 % higher in Latinos.

However, no studies have examined the direct effect of the plant/plant extract on tumor growth in an animal model.  Methods:   Verified prostate cancer cells were plated as 3D spheroids to determine the effect of extract from boiled Arum Palaestinum Boiss roots. In addition, male NU/NU mice (8 weeks old) with xenograft tumors derived from the prostate cancer cell line were treated daily with 1000 mg/kg body weight gavage of the suspension GZ17. The tumor growth was measured repeatedly with calipers and the excised tumors were weighed at the termination of the 3 week study. Control mice (10 mice in each group) received vehicle in the same manner and volume.  Results:   The number of live prostate cancer cells declined in a dose/dependent manner with a 24 h exposure to the extract at doses of 0.015 to 6.25 mg/mL. A fortified version of the extract (referred to as GZ17) that contained higher levels of isovanillin, linolenic acid and β-sitosterol had a stronger effect on the cell death rate, shifting the percentage of dead cells from 30 % to 55 % at the highest dose while the vehicle control had no effect on cell numbers. When GZ17 was applied to non-cancer tissue, in this case, human islets, there was no cell death at doses that were toxic to treated cancer cells. Preliminary toxicity studies were conducted on rats using an up-down design, with no signs of toxic effect at the highest dose. NU/NU mice with xenograft prostate tumors treated with GZ17 had a dramatic inhibition of tumor progression, while tumors in the control group grew steadily through the 3 weeks. The rate of tumor volume increase was 73 mm(3)/day for the vehicle group and 24 mm(3)/day for the GZ17 treated mice. While there was a trend towards lower excised tumor weight at study termination in the GZ17 treatment group, there was no statistical difference.

Knocking down PAGE4 expression results in cell death, whereas its overexpression leads to a growth advantage of prostate cancer cells (Zeng, Y., He, Y., Yang, F., Mooney, S. M., Getzenberg, R. H., Orban, J., and Kulkarni, P. (2011) The cancer/testis antigen prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a highly intrinsically disordered protein. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 13985-13994). Phosphorylation of PAGE4 at Thr-51 is critical for potentiating c-Jun transactivation, an important factor in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and stress response. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain has local and long-range conformational preferences that are perturbed by site-specific phosphorylation at Thr-51. The population of transient turn-like structures increases upon phosphorylation in an ∼20-residue acidic region centered on Thr-51. This central region therefore becomes more compact and more negatively charged, with increasing intramolecular contacts to basic sequence motifs near the N and C termini. Although flexibility is decreased in the central region of phospho-PAGE4, the polypeptide chain remains highly dynamic overall. PAGE4 utilizes a transient helical structure adjacent to the central acidic region to bind c-Jun with low affinity in vitro. The binding interaction is attenuated by phosphorylation at Thr-51, most likely because of masking the effects of the more compact phosphorylated state. Therefore, phosphorylation of PAGE4 leads to conformational shifts in the dynamic ensemble, with large functional consequences. The changes in the structural ensemble induced by posttranslational modifications are similar conceptually to the conformational switching events seen in some marginally stable (""metamorphic"") folded proteins in response to mutation or environmental triggers.""","""['Yanan He', 'Yihong Chen', 'Steven M Mooney', 'Krithika Rajagopalan', 'Ajay Bhargava', 'Elizabeth Sacho', 'Keith Weninger', 'Philip N Bryan', 'Prakash Kulkarni', 'John Orban']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an intrinsically disordered cancer/testis antigen, is a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer/testis antigen PAGE4, a regulator of c-Jun transactivation, is phosphorylated by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1, a component of the stress-response pathway.', 'The Stress-response protein prostate-associated gene 4, interacts with c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation.', 'Phosphorylation-induced conformational dynamics in an intrinsically disordered protein and potential role in phenotypic heterogeneity.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Intrinsically disordered proteins and conformational noise: The hypothesis a decade later.', 'Illuminating Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with Integrative Structural Biology.', 'Drugging the Undruggable: Targeting the N-Terminal Domain of Nuclear Hormone Receptors.', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Critical Components of the Wetware.', 'Protein conformational dynamics and phenotypic switching.']"""

Methods:   Four hundred seventy prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone pain who were suitable for local radiotherapy were randomly assigned to radiotherapy (single dose, 8 Gy) or intravenous infusion of ibandronate (6mg) in a noninferiority trial. Pain was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and four, eight, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.

Because the trial was designed with a 5% one-sided test, we provide 90% confidence intervals (two-sided) for differences in pain response.  Results:   Overall, pain response was not statistically different at four or 12 weeks (WHO: -3.7%, 90% confidence interval [CI] = -12.4% to 5.0%; and 6.7%, 90% CI = -2.6 to 16.0%, respectively).

In most guidelines, concomitant therapy with anti-androgens is recommended to prevent this flare phenomenon. However, there are few reports describing serum prostate-specific antigen transitions after hormonal therapy. Here, we present a case of a man who experienced the biochemical and clinical flare phenomenon despite prior anti-androgen use and who has detailed data.  Case presentation:   A 70-year-old Asian man with metastatic prostate cancer (multiple bone) was referred to our hospital. He was treated with prior anti-androgens and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. Regardless of prior use of anti-androgens, his low back pain caused by bone metastases was deteriorated and serum prostate-specific antigen level was raised from 974.8 ng/mL to 2,555.5 ng/mL within 3 weeks. Then, his serum prostate specific antigen level started to decrease along with the pain. The nadir reached 1.0 ng/mL and remained for 6 months. Because the serum level of prostate-specific antigen then began to increase again, anti-androgen was discontinued for anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome. Then the serum level decreased again to less than 0.1 ng/mL. Until now, his serum prostate-specific antigen level has been maintained at less than 0.1 ng/mL for more than 30 months without any clinical progressions.  Conclusion:   We present the case of a patient in whom a clinical flare caused by an leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was not prevented by prior anti-androgen administration. In addition, the nadir level of prostate-specific antigen when he received leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone monotherapy was ten times lower than when he received concomitant therapy, and period of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome was longer than usual. In this case, anti-androgen was probably not effective from the initial administration. Awareness of the possibility of ineffectiveness of anti-androgens is important in the treatment of symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer. Leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist and surgical castration is a more reliable clinical approach for the prostate cancer patients with symptomatic metastatic disease.""","""['Sho Uehara', 'Takeshi Yuasa', 'Yasuhisa Fujii', 'Akihiro Yano', 'Shinya Yamamoto', 'Hitoshi Masuda', 'Iwao Fukui', 'Junji Yonese']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['The long-term results with delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy in local or locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Undetectable level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir predicts PSA biochemical failure in local prostate cancer with delayed-combined androgen blockade.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Risk of disease flare with LHRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer: myth or fact?', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A Case of Switching from GnRH Agonist to Antagonist for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Control.']"""

Auto-detection of prostate cancer can play a major role in early detection of prostate cancer, which has a significant impact on patient survival rates. While multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) has shown promise in diagnosis of prostate cancer, the existing auto-detection algorithms do not take advantage of abundance of data available in MP-MRI to improve detection accuracy. The goal of this research was to design a radiomics-based auto-detection method for prostate cancer via utilizing MP-MRI data.  Methods:   In this work, we present new MP-MRI texture feature models for radiomics-driven detection of prostate cancer. In addition to commonly used non-invasive imaging sequences in conventional MP-MRI, namely T2-weighted MRI (T2w) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), our proposed MP-MRI texture feature models incorporate computed high-b DWI (CHB-DWI) and a new diffusion imaging modality called correlated diffusion imaging (CDI). Moreover, the proposed texture feature models incorporate features from individual b-value images. A comprehensive set of texture features was calculated for both the conventional MP-MRI and new MP-MRI texture feature models. We performed feature selection analysis for each individual modality and then combined best features from each modality to construct the optimized texture feature models.  Results:   The performance of the proposed MP-MRI texture feature models was evaluated via leave-one-patient-out cross-validation using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on 40,975 cancerous and healthy tissue samples obtained from real clinical MP-MRI datasets. The proposed MP-MRI texture feature models outperformed the conventional model (i.e., T2w+DWI) with regard to cancer detection accuracy.  Conclusions:   Comprehensive texture feature models were developed for improved radiomics-driven detection of prostate cancer using MP-MRI. Using a comprehensive set of texture features and a feature selection method, optimal texture feature models were constructed that improved the prostate cancer auto-detection significantly compared to conventional MP-MRI texture feature models.""","""['Farzad Khalvati', 'Alexander Wong', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Imaging""","""['MPCaD: a multi-scale radiomics-driven framework for automated prostate cancer localization and detection.', 'Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection using T2-weighted and high-b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Potential and limitations of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer including pelvic lymph node staging: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Basics, Advantages, Cautions, and Future Prospects.', 'Quantification of Multi-Parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based on Radiomics Analysis for Differentiation of Benign and Malignant Lesions of Prostate.', 'Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

Transference is generally recognized as an unconscious and inevitable part of relationships. Both nurse and patient ""transfer"" their past emotional and psychological needs into present situations and react accordingly. Consequently, the emotions and behaviors of nurses influence the reactions of their patients. Nurses must better understand their contributions to the nurse-patient relationship in order to better detect patient thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, nurses must recognize the needs of their patients and maintain a neutral and uncritical attitude. We developed a case management model to provide a consultation corner for cancer patients. Additionally, in an attempt to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, the developed model encouraged medical personnel to discuss sexual, belonging, and love problems with patients and to hold attitudes of professionalism, composure, caring, and solemnity. Belonging and love are basic human needs. However, for patients with prostate cancer, this basic need cannot be satisfied. Even professionally trained medical personnel have difficulty directly addressing this problem. This paper describes the meaning of transference and the importance of this concept in the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. Finally, developing better insights into the nurse-patient relationship will help nurses use these insights to improve the quality of patient interactions and of care.""","""['Min-Chia Wang', 'Wen-Tsung Huang', 'Shu-Chan Chang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Hu Li Za Zhi""","""['Transference in the nurse-patient relationship.', 'How Should Clinicians Respond to Transference Reactions with Cancer Patients?', ""Cancer patients' expressions of emotional cues and concerns and oncology nurses' responses, in an online patient-nurse communication service."", 'Working patterns and perceived contribution of prostate cancer clinical nurse specialists: a mixed method investigation.', 'Nursing intervention and older adults who have cancer: specific science and evidence based practice.']"""

The results showed that the expression of HMGA2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the prostate cancer tissues and cells was significantly higher than that in normal prostate tissues and cells (p < 0.05), and the positive expression rate of HMGA2 mRNA in the prostate cancer tissues from patients with positive lymph node metastasis or with high Gleason grade was significantly higher than that from patients with negative lymph node metastasis or with low Gleason grade (p < 0.05). In order to explore the role of HMGA2 in prostate cancer, the expression of HMGA2 in the human prostate cancer PC3 cell line was downregulated by RNA interference. Then, the changes in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of PC3 cells were examined by MTT test, PI staining, Annexin V-FITC staining, and Transwell chamber assay. Results showed that the abilities of proliferation, invasion, and migration were suppressed in HMGA2 knockdown PC3 cells, and the abilities of apoptosis were enhanced in HMGA2 knockdown PC3 cells. The expression of cyclin A and vimentin was downregulated in HMGA2 knockdown PC3 cells, and the expression of caspase 3 and E-cadherin was upregulated in HMGA2 knockdown PC3 cells. Taken together, the overexpression of HMGA2 in prostate cancer might be related to the tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis of prostate cancer, the downregulation of HMGA2 could inhibit cellular proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, and improve cellular apoptosis in prostate cancer, which might be a potential target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Junyan Cai', 'Guangyu Shen', 'Su Liu', 'Qingbing Meng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Silencing of HMGA2 promotes apoptosis and inhibits migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'HMGB1 promotes cellular proliferation and invasion, suppresses cellular apoptosis in osteosarcoma.', 'HMGA2 as a Critical Regulator in Cancer Development.', 'Oncological role of HMGA2 (Review).', 'Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA CERS6-AS1 on the Biological Behavior of Prostate Cancer Cell.', 'Effects of HMGA2 gene silencing on cell cycle and apoptosis in the metastatic renal carcinoma cell line ACHN.', 'Oncogenic role of HMGA2 in fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma cells.', 'High Mobility Group AT-Hook 2 (HMGA2) Oncogenicity in Mesenchymal and Epithelial Neoplasia.', 'Exploring the Potential of MicroRNA Let-7c as a Therapeutic for Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study, we validated the application of survivin as the tumor marker to detect CTC and assessed its utility for diagnosis of PCa distant metastasis. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) were performed to confirm the levels of surviving expression in PCa tissues. In addition, CTC values in 3 mL of peripheral blood from PCa patients, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and normal controls were also measured by the survivin-targeted PCR. Our results showed that surviving was overexpressed in PCa tissues. The median levels of blood surviving mRNA of PCa patients, BPH patients, and normal controls were 5.67 (range from 0 to 12.46), 2.24 (range from 0 to 6.55), and 1.85 (range from 0 to 3.82), respectively.

Since CT image intensities are directly related to positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation coefficients, they are indispensable for attenuation correction (AC) of the PET images. However, due to the relatively high dose of radiation exposure in CT scan, it is advised to limit the acquisition of CT images. In addition, in the new PET and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanner, only MR images are available, which are unfortunately not directly applicable to AC. These issues greatly motivate the development of methods for reliable estimate of CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method to tackle this challenging problem. Specifically, we first partition a given MR image into a set of patches. Then, for each patch, we use the structured random forest to directly predict a CT patch as a structured output, where a new ensemble model is also used to ensure the robust prediction. Image features are innovatively crafted to achieve multi-level sensitivity, with spatial information integrated through only rigid-body alignment to help avoiding the error-prone inter-subject deformable registration. Moreover, we use an auto-context model to iteratively refine the prediction. Finally, we combine all of the predicted CT patches to obtain the final prediction for the given MR image. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two datasets: human brain and prostate images. Experimental results show that our method can accurately predict CT images in various scenarios, even for the images undergoing large shape variation, and also outperforms two state-of-the-art methods.""","""['Tri Huynh', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Jiayin Kang', 'Li Wang', 'Pei Zhang', 'Jun Lian', ""Dinggang Shen;Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['PET attenuation correction using synthetic CT from ultrashort echo-time MR imaging.', 'Learning-based deformable registration for infant MRI by integrating random forest with auto-context model.', 'MRI-based attenuation correction for brain PET/MRI based on anatomic signature and machine learning.', 'Hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Challenges, Methods, and State of the Art of Hardware Component Attenuation Correction.', 'Aspects of MR image distortions in radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Mapping the terraces on the Loess Plateau based on a deep learning-based model at 1.89\u2009m resolution.', 'Applications of generative adversarial networks in neuroimaging and clinical neuroscience.', 'Establishment of a diagnostic model of coronary heart disease in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus based on machine learning algorithms.', 'Deep-learning synthesized pseudo-CT for MR high-resolution pediatric cranial bone imaging (MR-HiPCB).', 'Multi-Conditional Constraint Generative Adversarial Network-Based MR Imaging from CT Scan Data.']"""

The men had undergone primary or salvage external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT combined with high-dose rate brachytherapy (BT). We also used information from 155 non-treated reference men from the general population with no history of prostate cancer, matched for age and residency.  Results:   Median time from treatment to follow-up was 5 years (range: 1-14 years). Among the 16 investigated symptoms on erectile function, libido, orgasm, and seminal fluid, 9 symptoms in the primary EBRT group and 10 in both the salvage EBRT and the EBRT+BT groups were statistically significantly more prevalent in survivors than in reference men. Erectile dysfunction was influenced by both age and time to follow-up, whereas symptoms relating to orgasm and seminal fluid were influenced by time to follow-up only. Not being sexually active was almost one and a half times as common in survivors as in reference men.

The impact of adoption of these technologies on the costs of palliative radiation treatment in patients with metastatic prostate cancer remains poorly understood in the general patient population.  Methods:   The study was a retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Medicare data of men aged 66 and older who died from metastatic prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 and received radiation therapy for bony metastases in the last year of life.

Results:   A total of 1705 men met study inclusion criteria. Total Medicare payments for radiation therapy for bony metastases in the last year of life increased by 44.4% from an average of $2,763 in 2000 to $3,989 in 2007, with the proportion of all payments accrued within hospital-based settings increasing from 48% to 57%. Complexity of radiation therapy techniques over the same period was characterized by use of less simple (30.1% to 23.3%) and more complex (59.9% versus 66.7%) radiation therapy. From 2000-2003 to 2004-2007, the use of shorter treatment courses (≤5 fractions) decreased from 22% to 14%, and the use of single fraction treatment courses decreased by half (6.3% to 2.9%; P≤.001).

The extracellular matrix laminin class of proteins is an abundant component of both myelinated and non-myelinated nerves. Analysis of human pancreatic and prostate tissue revealed both perineural and endoneural invasion with Schwann cells surrounded or disrupted by tumor, respectively. Tumor and nerve cell co-culture conditions were used to determine if myelinating or non-myelinating Schwann cell (S16 and S16Y, respectively) phenotype was equally likely to promote integrin-dependent cancer cell invasion and migration on laminin. Conditioned medium from S16 cells increased tumor cell (DU145, PC3, and CFPAC1) invasion into laminin approximately 1.3-2.0 fold compared to fetal bovine serum (FBS) treated cells. Integrin function (e.g., ITGA6p formation) increased up to 1.5 fold in prostate (DU145, PC3, RWPE-1) and pancreatic (CFPAC1) cells, and invasion was dependent on ITGA6p formation and ITGB1 as determined by function-blocking antibodies. In contrast, conditioned medium isolated from S16Y cells (non-myelinating phenotype) decreased constitutive levels of ITGA6p in the tumor cells by 50% compared to untreated cells and decreased ITGA6p formation 3.0 fold compared to S16 treated cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed loss of ITGA6p formation as reversible and independent of overall loss of ITGA6 expression. These results suggest that the myelinating phenotype of Schwann cells within the tumor microenvironment increased integrin-dependent tumor invasion on laminin.""","""['Isis C Sroka', 'Harsharon Chopra', 'Lipsa Das', 'Jaime M C Gard', 'Raymond B Nagle', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Intracellular modifiers of integrin alpha 6p production in aggressive prostate and breast cancer cell lines.', 'Gene Editing of α6 Integrin Inhibits Muscle Invasive Networks and Increases Cell-Cell Biophysical Properties in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrin alpha 6 expression in human prostate carcinoma cells is associated with a migratory and invasive phenotype in vitro and in vivo.', 'The laminin binding integrin alpha6beta1 in prostate cancer perineural invasion.', 'Integrin clipping: a novel adhesion switch?', 'Schwann cells regulate tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma microenvironment.', 'Melanoma-associated repair-like Schwann cells suppress anti-tumor T-cells via 12/15-LOX/COX2-associated eicosanoid production.', 'A reciprocal feedback between colon cancer cells and Schwann cells promotes the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer.', 'Schwann Cells Induce Phenotypic Changes in Oral Cancer Cells.', 'Overexpression of GATA5 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Progression by Regulating PLAGL2 via the FAK/PI3K/AKT Pathway.']"""

This study explores the value of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) in characterizing incidental prostate (18)F-FDG uptake.  Methods:   Thirty-one patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for reasons unrelated to prostate cancer and prostate mpMRI were eligible for this retrospective study. The mpMRI included T2-weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) sequences. Fourteen patients were excluded (n = 8 insufficient histopathology, n = 6 radical prostatectomy before PET), and final analysis included 17 patients. A nuclear medicine physician, blinded to clinicopathologic findings, identified suspicious areas and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV max) on (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Sector-based imaging findings were correlated with annotated histopathology from whole-mount or MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy samples. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were estimated using generalized estimating equations with logit link. Results were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparisons tests.  Results:   The PPV of (18)F-FDG PET alone in detecting prostate cancer was 0.65. Combining (18)F-FDG PET as a base parameter with mpMRI (T2W, DCE, ADC, and MRS) increased the PPV to 0.82, 0.83, 0.83, and 0.94, respectively. All benign lesions had SUV max < 6. Malignant lesions had higher SUV max values that correlated with Gleason scores. There was a significant difference in SUV max per prostate between the Gleason ≥ 4 + 5 and benign categories (p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Focal incidental prostate (18)F-FDG uptake has low clinical utility alone, but regions of uptake may harbor high-grade prostate cancer, especially if SUV max > 6.

The accurate diagnosis of these lesions is both important and challenging. Recently, studies suggest that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations could be a biomarker for urothelial carcinoma (UC). We hypothesized that these mutations can distinguish UC with glandular differentiation from nephrogenic adenoma, primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder (PAUB), or secondary malignancies. Twenty-five cases of benign glandular lesions (including nephrogenic adenoma); 29 cases of UC with glandular differentiation; 10 cases of PAUB; and 10 cases each of metastatic colon cancer, prostatic carcinoma, and carcinoma from Mullerian origin were collected. Slides were reviewed and selected to make sure the lesion was at least 10% to 20% of all tissue. Macrodissection was performed in some of cases, and genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue. Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations were determined by standard polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Twenty-one cases (72%) of UC with glandular differentiation were positive for TERT promoter mutations. However, none of the remaining cases (total 65 cases of benign lesions, PAUB, and metastatic carcinomas) was positive for TERT promoter mutation. Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations were highly associated with UC including UC with glandular differentiation but not other glandular lesions of bladder. Therefore, in conjunction with morphologic features, Immunohistochemistry stain profile, and clinical information, TERT promoter mutations could distinguish UC with glandular differentiation from other bladder glandular lesions. In addition, lack of TERT promoter mutations in primary adenocarcinoma of bladder suggests that this entity may have different origin or carcinogenesis from those of UC.""","""['Eric Vail', 'Xiaoyong Zheng', 'Ming Zhou', 'Ximing Yang', 'John T Fallon', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Minghao Zhong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Diagn Pathol""","""['Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations in primary adenocarcinoma of bladder and urothelial carcinoma with glandular differentiation: pathogenesis and diagnostic implications.', 'Recurrent TERT promoter mutations in urothelial carcinoma and potential clinical applications.', 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation analysis of benign, malignant and reactive urothelial lesions reveals a subpopulation of inverted papilloma with immortalizing genetic change.', 'Implications of TERT promoter mutations and telomerase activity in urothelial carcinogenesis.', 'TERT promoter mutations and methylation for telomerase activation in urothelial carcinomas: New mechanistic insights and clinical significance.', 'Precision Medicine in Bladder Cancer: Present Challenges and Future Directions.', 'Urothelial Carcinoma: Divergent Differentiation and Morphologic Subtypes.', 'Clinical and Genomic Characterization of Bladder Carcinomas With Glandular Phenotype.', 'Molecular Pathology of Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Advances in bladder cancer biology and therapy.']"""

In Taiwan, TRUS prostate biopsy has not been well-studied on a nationwide scale. This article aimed to study TRUS prostate biopsy in Taiwan and its related complications, according to the claims generated through the National Health Insurance (NHI) program.  Methods:   We applied for access to claims from the NHI Research Database of Taiwan of all patients who visited the urology clinic during the period of 2006 to 2010. In the 5-year urology profile, we obtained all records, which included admission and ambulatory clinical records. The definition of TRUS biopsy included codes for ultrasound-guided procedure and for prostate puncture; other codes involving complications such as postbiopsy voiding difficulty, significant bleeding, or infection requiring treatment were also included. Risk factors included age, diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalization or nonhospitalization, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; with a value of 0, 1, 2 or ≥ 3). Descriptive and comparative analyses were also performed.  Results:   In the 5-year urology profile, 12,968 TRUS biopsies performed of which 6885 were in-patient procedures and 6083 were ambulatory clinic procedures. After the procedures, 1266 (9.76%) biopsies were associated with voiding difficulty; 148 (1.14%) biopsies, with significant bleeding; and 855 (6.59%) biopsies, with infection that required treatment. The prostate cancer diagnosis rate was 36.02%. The overall biopsy-related mortality rate within 30 days was 0.25%, and the postbiopsy sepsis-related mortality rate was 0.13%. Age, diagnosis of cancer, hospitalization, and CCI value ≥ 1 were all significant factors in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis for postbiopsy voiding difficulty and severe infection. A diagnosis of cancer and a CCI value ≥ 2 were significant factors for significant bleeding after biopsy. Patients diagnosed as having prostate cancer had fewer bleeding complications after biopsy.  Conclusion:   The most frequent complication was postbiopsy voiding difficulty, followed by infection that required treatment and significant bleeding. The sepsis-related mortality rate was 0.13%.

However, there have been few studies of the function of HMGB1 in the malignant biological behaviour of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC), and the potential mechanism of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of BUC remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we constructed plasmid vectors that are capable of synthesizing specific shRNAs targeting HMGB1 and transfected them into BUC cells to persistently suppress the endogenous gene expression of HMGB1. The expression of HMGB1, the bioactivity of BUC cells, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, migration and invasion, and the effects of HMGB1 knockdown on downstream signalling pathways were investigated.

Methods and materials:   This prospective study examined genetic polymorphisms that modulate the expression of 4 genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis and response to radiation (HMOX1, NFE2L2, NOS3, and TGFβ1). DNA from blood samples of 179 patients (∼ 80% breast and head and neck) collected at the time of diagnosis by their radiation oncologist as exhibiting late normal tissue toxicity was used for the analysis. Patient demographics were as follows: 56% white, 43% African American, 1% other. Allelic frequencies of the different polymorphisms of the participants were compared with those of the general American population stratified by race. Twenty-six additional patients treated with radiation, but without toxicity at 3 months or later after therapy, were also analyzed.  Results:   Increased frequency of a long GT repeat in the HMOX1 promoter was associated with late effects in both African American and white populations. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs1800469 in the TGFβ1 promoter and the rs6721961 SNP in the NFE2L2 promoter were also found to significantly associate with late effects in African Americans but not whites. A combined analysis of these polymorphisms revealed that >90% of African American patients with late effects had at least 1 of these minor alleles, and 58% had 2 or more. No statistical significance was found relating the studied NOS3 polymorphisms and normal tissue toxicity.

Although associated organisational changes closely intersect with professional interests, there are relatively few studies in the literature on hospital discharge that explicitly examine the role of professional groups. Recent contributions to the literature on organisational studies of the professions help to specify how professional groups in hospitals contribute to the introduction and routinisation of discharge arrangements. This study builds on a view of organisational and professional projects as closely intertwined, where professionals take up organising roles and where organisations shape professionalism.  Methods:   The analysis is based on a case study of the introduction and routinisation of explicit discharge arrangements for patients with prostate cancer in two hospitals in Denmark. This represents a typical case that involves changes in professional practice without being first and foremost a professional project. The multiple case design also makes the findings more robust. The analysis draws from 12 focus groups with doctors, nurses and secretaries conducted at two different stages in the process of the making of the local discharge arrangements.  Results:   From the analysis, two distinct local models of discharge arrangements that connect more or less directly to existing professional practice emerge: an 'add-on' model, which relies on extra resources, special activities and enforced change; and an 'embedded model', which builds on existing ways of working, current resources, and perspectives of professional groups. The two models reveal differences in the roles of professional groups in terms of their stakes and involvement in the process of organisational change: whereas in the 'add on' model the professional groups remain at a distance, in the 'embedded model' they are closely engaged.  Conclusions:   In terms of understanding the making of hospital discharge arrangements, the study contributes two sets of insights into the specific roles of professional groups. First, professional interests are an important driver for health professionals to engage in adapting discharge arrangements; and second, professional practice offers a powerful lever for turning new discharge arrangements into organisational routines.""","""['Viola Burau', 'Flemming Bro']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Caseload midwifery as organisational change: the interplay between professional and organisational projects in Denmark.', 'Professional groups driving change toward patient-centred care: interprofessional working in stroke rehabilitation in Denmark.', ""How has the impact of 'care pathway technologies' on service integration in stroke care been measured and what is the strength of the evidence to support their effectiveness in this respect?"", 'New ways of working in mental health services: a qualitative, comparative case study assessing and informing the emergence of new peer worker roles in mental health services in England.', 'Integration and continuity of primary care: polyclinics and alternatives – a patient-centred analysis of how organisation constrains care co-ordination.', 'Medicine and management: looking inside the box of changing hospital governance.']"""

Methods:   Seventy-six consecutive patients with 89 MRI-identified targets underwent MTTP biopsy. Separate targeted biopsies and background cores were obtained according to a standardized protocol. Target biopsies were considered of added diagnostic value if these cores showed a higher Gleason grade than non-targeted cores taken from the same sector (Group 1, n = 41). Conversely, where background cores demonstrated an equal or higher Gleason grade, target cores were considered to be non-beneficial (Group 2, n = 48).  Results:   There was no significant difference in age, PSA, prostate volume, time-to-biopsy, and number of cores obtained between the groups. A greater proportion of target cores were positive for cancer (158/228; 69.3 %) compared to background (344/1881; 18.38 %). The median target volume was 0.54 cm(3) for Group 1 (range 0.09-2.79 cm(3)) and 1.65 cm(3) for Group 2 (0.3-9.07 cm(3)), p < 0.001. The targets in Group 1 had statistically lower diameters for short and long axes, even after correction for gland size. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was demonstrated when a lesion cutoff value of 1.0 cm in short axis was applied, resulting in a sensitivity of 83.3 % and a specificity of 82.9 %.

Due to its rarity this entity is not subject to standardized treatment guidelines, there is debate about typical initial symptoms that may lead to finding the correct diagnosis and information about the clinical course is also sparse.  Methods:   We have conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with pituitary metastases who were surgically treated via a transsphenoidal procedure at our institution between 2006 and 2014. Underlying primary disease, clinical and surgical course as well as adjuvant radiotherapy and follow-up data are presented.  Results:   14 patients met the inclusion criteria (8 female, 6 male). Mean age was 61.5 years. Most patients became symptomatic with visual symptoms--both visual deterioration and/or diplopia (n = 13)--and anterior lobe insufficiency (n = 8). Surprisingly diabetes insipidus was only seen in three patients. All patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery initially, four patients had to undergo surgery for residual tumor or recurrence, two of them via a transcranial route. Breast cancer was the most common entity (n = 6), followed by prostate cancer (n = 3), nsclc (n = 2) and melanoma, thyroid cancer and renal cancer in one case each. Postoperative MRI showed gross total resection in four cases and residual disease in eight cases (subtotal resection, partial resection and biopsy), two patients files were incomplete regarding MRI-results. All patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. Survival after the initial diagnosis of cancer was 36 and 16 months after diagnosis of pituitary metastases.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that transsphenoidal surgery is a safe method to resect pituitary metastases and that the extend of resection does not have an influence on survival time. Our results also indicate that diabetes insipidus may not be the most common initial symptom of pituitary metastases and lack thereof should not lead to making a wrong diagnosis and delaying appropriate therapy.""","""['T Burkhardt', 'M Henze', 'L A Kluth', 'M Westphal', 'N O Schmidt', 'J Flitsch']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pituitary""","""['Intraoperative high-field MRI for transsphenoidal reoperations of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma.', 'Primary adult infradiaphragmatic craniopharyngiomas: clinical features, management, and outcomes in one Chinese institution.', 'Giant pituitary adenomas: surgical outcomes of 50 cases operated on by the endonasal endoscopic approach.', 'Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery in elderly patients with pituitary adenomas.', 'Lymphocytic infundibulo-hypophysitis with diabetes insipidus as a new clinical entity: a case report and review of the literature.', 'The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the multidisciplinary management of pituitary metastases.', 'Rare sites of breast cancer metastasis: a review.', 'Pituitary Metastasis From Urothelial Carcinoma: A Case Report and Review of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pituitary Metastases.', 'Pituitary Metastasis of Lung Neuroendocrine Carcinoma Mimicking Pituitary Adenoma:Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Pituitary metastases: presentation and outcomes from a pituitary center over the last decade.']"""

It is not fully understood whether genetic variations in telomere-related genes are associated with development and progression in PCa patients.  Methods:   Six potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three key telomere-related genes were evaluated in 1015 PCa cases and 1052 cancer-free controls, to test their associations with risk of PCa. Among 426 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), the prognostic significance of the studied SNPs on biochemical recurrence (BCR) was also assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model. The relative telomere lengths (RTLs) were measured in peripheral blood leukocytes using real-time PCR in the RP patients.  Results:   TEP1 rs1760904 AG/AA genotypes were significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (odds ratio (OR): 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.93, P=0.005) compared with the GG genotype. By using median RTL as a cutoff level, RP patients with TEP1 rs1760904 AG/AA genotypes tended to have a longer RTL than those with the GG genotype (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.04-2.30, P=0.031). A significant interaction between TEP1 rs1713418 and age in modifying PCa risk was observed (P=0.005).

Therefore, reducing the availability of cholesterol for use as a precursor in androgen synthesis may reduce proliferation and disease progression.  Methods:   LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice were castrated and administered simvastatin via diet, and tumor volume and PSA concentration were monitored for 8 weeks post castration. Levels of serum and intratumoral androgens along with serum simvastatin and common toxicity markers were measured at end point.  Results:   Reduced post-castration tumor growth rate in simvastatin-treated mice correlated with delayed time to castration-resistant progression, determined by two serum PSA doublings from post-castration nadir, when compared with xenografts in mice on control diet. At 8 weeks post castration, serum simvastatin levels were comparable to clinically relevant human doses with no evidence of overt muscle or liver toxicity. This suppressed post-castration tumor growth in the simvastatin diet group was correlated with reduced intratumoral testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels.

However, reliable prognostic/predictive factors for determining this are lacking. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed to assist with clinical decision-making in this setting. Enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the regulatory-approved CellSearch System (CSS) is prognostic in metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize that CTCs may also be prognostic in the post-prostatectomy setting.  Methods:   Patient blood samples (n=55) were processed on the CSS to enumerate CTCs at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of RT. CTC values were correlated with predictive/prognostic factors and progression-free survival.  Results:   CTC status (presence/absence) correlated significantly with positive margins (increased likelihood of CTC(neg) disease; P=0.032), and trended toward significance with the presence of seminal vesicle invasion (CTC(pos); P=0.113) and extracapsular extension (CTC(neg); P=0.116). Although there was a trend toward a decreased time to biochemical failure (BCF) in baseline CTC-positive patients (n=9), this trend was not significant (hazard ratio (HR)=0.3505; P=0.166). However, CTC-positive status at any point (n=16) predicted for time to BCF (HR=0.2868; P=0.0437).  Conclusions:   One caveat of this study is the small sample size utilized (n=55) and the low number of patients with CTC-positive disease (n=16). However, our results suggest that CTCs may be indicative of disseminated disease and assessment of CTCs during RT may be helpful in clinical decision-making to determine, which patients may benefit from RT versus those who may benefit more from systemic treatments.""","""['L E Lowes', 'M Lock', 'G Rodrigues', ""D D'Souza"", 'G Bauman', 'B Ahmad', 'V Venkatesan', 'A L Allan', 'T Sexton']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells in prostate cancer patients receiving salvage radiotherapy.', 'Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Locally Advanced High-risk Prostate Cancer During Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic and clinicopathological significance of circulating tumor cells detected by RT-PCR in non-metastatic colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer: a potential surrogate marker of survival.', 'Zeolite Nanoparticles Loaded with 2-Methoxystradiol as a Novel Drug Delivery System for the Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Overcoming Obstacles in Liquid Biopsy Developments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Metastatic Spread in Prostate Cancer Patients Influencing Radiotherapy Response.', 'DNA Microsystems for Biodiagnosis.', 'MgO nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol as carrier for 2-Methoxyestradiol anticancer drug.']"""

Many genes has been shown to be involved in the progress of the prostate cancer. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a multifunctional protein that has an important role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of ApE1 1349T>G polymorphism and the susceptibility to prostate cancer in northern Iran population. Samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer patients and 100 controls subjects and genotyped by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). We observed a significant difference in genotype distributions of ApE1 1349T>G polymorphism between patients and controls (P= 0.039).

The TRAMP model develops and progresses through all stages of carcinogenesis similarly to humans. We hypothesized that a 10% TP diet intervention after puberty would reduce carcinogenesis at 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age in TRAMP mice. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 X FVB F1 TRAMP mice were randomized to consume either an AIN-93G + 10% TP diet (n = 90) or the AIN-93G control diet (n = 88) and randomized to 1 of 3 end point ages: 12 (n = 59), 16 (n = 60), or 20 (n = 59) weeks of age. There was no difference between diets in overall cancer incidence at any time point. However, at 16 weeks of age, TP significantly increased high-grade PIN (P = .014) and significantly decreased poorly differentiated (P = .024) lesions compared with the control diet suggesting a delay in the progression of prostate cancer. Two variables that may explain the modest effect of TP in this study are as follows: the low amount of lycopene in the TP diet (12.3 ppm) and the timing of the intervention (8 weeks of age). The TP diet contained 30-fold less lycopene than previous studies in our laboratory. In addition, the initiation of the diet intervention time of 8 weeks of age instead of 4 weeks of age may have been too late in cancer progression to substantially impact carcinogenesis. In conclusion, a low-lycopene TP intervention failed to reduce carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice.""","""['Lauren E Conlon', 'Matthew A Wallig', 'John W Erdman Jr']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nutr Res""","""['Tomatoes, Lycopene, and Prostate Cancer: What Have We Learned from Experimental Models?', 'Dietary tomato and lycopene impact androgen signaling- and carcinogenesis-related gene expression during early TRAMP prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The interactions of dietary tomato powder and soy germ on prostate carcinogenesis in the TRAMP model.', ""β-Carotene 9',10' Oxygenase Modulates the Anticancer Activity of Dietary Tomato or Lycopene on Prostate Carcinogenesis in the TRAMP Model."", 'Tomato products, lycopene, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Improving Whole Tomato Transformation for Prostate Health: Benign Prostate Hypertrophy as an Exploratory Model.', 'The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Tomatoes, Lycopene, and Prostate Cancer: What Have We Learned from Experimental Models?', 'Scientometric and Methodological Analysis of the Recent Literature on the Health-Related Effects of Tomato and Tomato Products.', 'Recent Progress in Discovering the Role of Carotenoids and Metabolites in Prostatic Physiology and Pathology-A Review-Part II: Carotenoids in the Human Studies.']"""

Several studies reported that androgens inhibit breast cancer cell growth, whereas others linked their action with the modulation of calcium (Ca(2+)) pumps, Ca(2+) channels and Ca(2+)-binding proteins. Also, it is known that deregulated Ca(2+) homeostasis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of breast. The L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCCs) were found to be up-regulated in colon, colorectal and prostate cancer, but their presence in breast tissues remains uncharacterized. On the other hand, regucalcin (RGN) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein involved in the control of mammary gland cell proliferation, which has been identified as an androgen target gene in distinct tissues except breast. This study aimed to confirm the expression and activity of LTCCs in human breast cancer cells and investigate the effect of androgens in regulating the expression of α1C subunit (Cav1.2) of LTCCs and Ca(2+)-binding protein RGN. PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and electrophysiological experiments demonstrated the expression and activity of Cav1.2 subunit in MCF-7 cells. The MCF-7 cells were treated with 1, 10 or 100 nM of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 24-72 h. The obtained results showed that 1 nM DHT up-regulated the expression of Cav1.2 subunit while diminishing RGN protein levels, which was underpinned by reduced cell viability.

We evaluated the effect of family history on CRC incidence and mortality after 55 years of age, when the risk of early onset cancer had passed.  Methods:   We collected data from participants in the randomized, controlled Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial of flexible sigmoidoscopy versus usual care (55-74 years old, no history of CRC), performed at 10 US centers from 1993 to 2001. A detailed family history of colorectal cancer was obtained at enrollment, and subjects were followed for CRC incidence and mortality for up to 13 years.  Results:   Among 144,768 participants, 14,961 subjects (10.3%) reported a family of CRC. Of 2090 incident cases, 273 cases (13.1%) had a family history of CRC; among 538 deaths from CRC, 71 (13.2%) had a family history of CRC. Overall, family history of CRC was associated with an increased risk of CRC incidence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.50; P<.0001) and increased mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69; P = .03). Subjects with 1 first degree relative (FDR) with CRC (n = 238; HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.42) or ≥2 FDRs with CRC (n = 35; HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.44-2.86) were at increased risk for incident CRC. However, among individuals with 1 FDR with CRC, there were no differences in risk based on age at diagnosis in the FDR (for FDR <60 years of age: HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.63; for FDR 60-70 years of age: HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06-1.62; for FDR >70 years of age: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.45; P trend = .59).  Conclusions:   After 55 years of age, subjects with 1 FDR with CRC had only a modest increase in risk for CRC incidence and death; age of onset in the FDR was not significantly associated with risk. Individuals with ≥2 FDRs with CRC had continued increased risk in older age. Guidelines and clinical practice for subjects with a family history of CRC should be modified to align CRC testing to risk.

Methods:   An observational prospective study was performed in 775 consecutive men with preoperative PSA levels ≤20 ng/mL who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined PCa. We evaluated prostate specimens using a cMDX-based map model of the prostate and determined the prostate volume, number of cancer foci, relative tumor volume, Gleason score, zone of origin, localization, and pathologic stage after stratification according to PSA levels categorized into 3 groups: <4 ng/mL, 4-10 ng/mL, and 10.1-20 ng/mL. The distribution of 5254 PCa foci was analyzed after stratification according to PSA levels and visualized on heat maps. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the odds ratios of PSA levels for the presence of PCa in 16 regions.  Results:   PCa with PSA <4 ng/mL was predominantly localized to the apical part and the peripheral zone of the prostate. PCa with a PSA level 10.1-20 ng/mL (16.4% of cases) was observed more frequently in the anterior part and the base of the prostate than PCa with a PSA level <4 or 4-10 ng/mL (6% and 10%, respectively).  Conclusion:   Preoperative PSA levels vary according to the spatial distribution of PCa in radical prostatectomy specimens. The probability of anterior PCa is increased with higher PSA serum levels.

Materials and methods:   A prospective database of patients undergoing prostate needle biopsies at Virginia Mason from 2004 to 2014 was reviewed. Welch's t-test and chi-square tests were used to compare patients seen before to those seen after the USPSTF recommendation. Relative risks and corresponding confidence intervals were estimated by general linear regression.  Results:   Patients in the post-USPSTF group (310) had a higher prostate specific antigen (p <0.001), were more likely to be diagnosed with higher clinical stage (2b, p=0.003; 2c-3a, p=0.027) and D'Amico high risk prostate cancer (p=0.036), with an adjusted relative risk for high risk prostate cancer of 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.52) compared to those in the pre-USPSTF group (1,416). Limiting the pre-USPSTF group to the 30 months before the draft guidelines (448 patients) yielded similar results. The absolute number of biopsies performed decreased by 31%, with the majority of the decrease occurring in the detection of intermediate risk tumors.  Conclusions:   In the 2 and a half years after the USPSTF recommendation against prostate specific antigen based screening, patients undergoing prostate needle biopsies were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with high risk disease. However, a reduction in the number of prostate needle biopsies performed occurred concomitantly with a decrease in the detection of intermediate risk, potentially curable prostate cancer.

We retrospectively investigated whether coadministration of low-dose glucocorticoids has clinical benefits.  Material and methods:   Records from 358 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated consecutively with either D 75mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (n = 124) (Rigshospitalet) or D and prednisolone (P) 10mg daily (n = 234) (Herlev Hospital) given as first-line chemotherapy were reviewed. Of these, 15 patients treated with glucocorticoids at initiation of D at Rigshospitalet were excluded. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 was used to register any grade of peripheral edema, grade ≥2 sensory neuropathy, and grade ≥3 nonhematological toxicity. Background clinical data, rates of toxicity, hospital admissions, dose reductions, and post-D treatments were analyzed by the Chi-squared test or Mann-Whitney U test. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Patients treated with D alone had a higher incidence of peripheral edema (32% vs. 15%, P<0.001) and grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (56% vs. 43%, P = 0.022). Patients treated with D alone were also more frequently hospitalized (53% vs. 41%, P = 0.035), mainly owing to a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in this group (25% vs. 10%, P<0.001).

They typically assume a low hit rate per plate. Hit rates can be dramatically higher in secondary screening, RNAi screening and in drug sensitivity testing using biologically active drugs. In particular, drug sensitivity testing on primary cells is often based on dose-response experiments, which pose a more stringent requirement for data quality and for intra- and inter-plate variation. Here, we compared common plate normalization and noise-reduction methods, including the B-score and the Loess a local polynomial fit method under high hit-rate scenarios of drug sensitivity testing. We generated simulated 384-well plate HTS datasets, each with 71 plates having a range of 20 (5%) to 160 (42%) hits per plate, with controls placed either at the edge of the plates or in a scattered configuration.  Results:   We identified 20% (77/384) as the critical hit-rate after which the normalizations started to perform poorly. Results from real drug testing experiments supported this estimation. In particular, the B-score resulted in incorrect normalization of high hit-rate plates, leading to poor data quality, which could be attributed to its dependency on the median polish algorithm.

Patients and methods:   In total, 178 men with serum PSA levels within 2.1-10 ng/ml who underwent repeat biopsies after initial negative biopsy results, were enrolled. Prostate cancer detection rates with a Gleason score of 7 or more according to age, serum PSA, %fPSA, and PSAV were investigated. The cumulative probability of detecting cancer according to risk factors was also investigated.  Results:   Out of 178 men who underwent repeat biopsy, 48 (27.0%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the observation period, and pathological examination revealed prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7 or more in 17 patients (35.4%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, %fPSA ≤ 12 at repeat biopsy and PSAV >0.40 ng/ml/year were determined to be independent risk factors for prostate cancer, and %fPSA ≤ 12 at initial biopsy and PSAV >0.40 for cancer of Gleason score 7 or greater. The cumulative probabilities of developing high-grade cancer after 5 years were 55.8% and 4.0% in men with %fPSA ≤ 12 at initial biopsy and PSAV >0.40, and in men without both, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in probabilities between groups by the log-rank test.

Emetine, a naturally-derived alkaloid from the Ipecacuanha plant, has been shown to have potential for anti-tumorigenic effects for cancer treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize novel emetine dithiocarbamate (EMTDTC) analogs for potent anti-tumorigenic activity with minimal toxicity to normal prostate cells and identify targeted apoptotic regulatory genes. The leading key compounds, EMTDTC-55 and EMTDTC-56 were studied.  Materials and methods:   Established methods of cell flow cytometry were used to analyze apoptotic potential in prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3 and LNCaP) and real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying key genes mediating apoptosis.  Results:   The effect of EMTDTC-55 on DU145, LNCaP and PC3 revealed significant anti-tumorigenic activities. Both compounds showed highly significant apoptotic potential on days 3 and 5 in the prostate cancer cells. Key apoptotic genes were differentially regulated suggestive of cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in androgen-independent cell lines, DU145 and PC3, by both compounds. However, in the androgen-dependent cell line LNCaP, cells were marginally affected by EMTDTC-55, but significant apoptosis was observed by EMTDTC-56 leading to cell-cycle arrest.

Although high levels of CD73 are associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer, the clinical impact of CD73 in prostate cancer remains unclear.  Experimental design:   We evaluated the prognostic value of CD73 protein expression and CD8(+) cell density in 285 cases of prostate cancer on tissue microarray (TMA). Normal adjacent and tumor tissues were evaluated in duplicates.  Results:   Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that high levels of CD73 in normal adjacent prostate epithelium were significantly associated with shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Notably, CD73 expression in normal epithelium conferred a negative prognostic value to prostate-infiltrating CD8(+) cells. Surprisingly, high levels of CD73 in the tumor stroma were associated with longer BCR-free survival in univariate analysis. In vitro studies revealed that adenosine signaling inhibited NF-κB activity in human prostate cancer cells via A2B adenosine receptors. Consistent with these results, CD73 expression in the prostate tumor stroma negatively correlated with p65 expression in the nuclei of prostate tumor cells.  Conclusions:   Our study revealed that CD73 is an independent prognostic factor in prostate cancer. Our data support a model in which CD73 expression in the prostate epithelium suppresses immunosurveillance by CD8(+) T cells, whereas CD73 expression in the tumor stroma reduces NF-κB signaling in tumor cells via A2B adenosine receptor signaling. CD73 expression, including in normal adjacent prostate epithelium, can thus effectively discriminate between aggressive and indolent forms of prostate cancer.""","""['Bruno G Leclerc', 'Roxanne Charlebois', 'Guillaume Chouinard', 'Bertrand Allard', 'Sandra Pommey', 'Fred Saad', 'John Stagg']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Specific blockade CD73 alters the ""exhausted"" phenotype of T cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'CD73 acts as a prognostic biomarker and promotes progression and immune escape in pancreatic cancer.', 'Targeting CD73 enhances the antitumor activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.', 'Targeting CD73 and downstream adenosine receptor signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Role of CD73 in Disease: Promising Prognostic Indicator and Therapeutic Target.', 'The Clinical Significance of CD73 in Cancer.', 'Radiomics using computed tomography to predict CD73 expression and prognosis of colorectal cancer liver metastases.', 'Inhibitors of the CD73-adenosinergic checkpoint as promising combinatory agents for conventional and advanced cancer immunotherapy.', 'Single-cell omics traces the heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.', 'Identification of m6A-associated LncRNAs as predict factors for the immune infiltration and prognosis of thyroid cancer.']"""

Unfortunately, the utility of poly(A) libraries is greatly limited when the input RNA is degraded, which is the norm for research tissues and clinical samples, especially when specimens are formalin-fixed. To facilitate the use of RNA sequencing beyond cell lines and in the clinical setting, we developed an exome-capture transcriptome protocol with greatly improved performance on degraded RNA. Capture transcriptome libraries enable measuring absolute and differential gene expression, calling genetic variants, and detecting gene fusions. Through validation against gold-standard poly(A) and Ribo-Zero libraries from intact RNA, we show that capture RNA-seq provides accurate and unbiased estimates of RNA abundance, uniform transcript coverage, and broad dynamic range. Unlike poly(A) selection and Ribo-Zero depletion, capture libraries retain these qualities regardless of RNA quality and provide excellent data from clinical specimens including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Systematic improvements across key applications of RNA-seq are shown on a cohort of prostate cancer patients and a set of clinical FFPE samples. Further, we demonstrate the utility of capture RNA-seq libraries in a patient with a highly malignant solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) enrolled in our clinical sequencing program called MI-ONCOSEQ.

Methods:   An analysis of pooled data from two mortality follow-back surveys was performed. Aggressive EOL care was defined as greater than or equal to one of the following indicators occurring during the last 3 months of life: greater than or equal to two emergency department visits, ≥30 days in hospital and death in hospital.  Results:   Of the 681 included patients, 50.1% were men and mean age at death was 75 years.

In all tissues, the SNRs and CNRs of the DWI, ADC map and EADC map were not significantly different between pre- and post-contrast (P > 0.05). Between pre- and post-contrast, ADC and EADC values showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.894) and variability of ≤3.2 %.  Conclusion:   Prostate 3 T-DWI after GBCA administration may be used without a significant difference in SNR or CNR, with minimal variability of the cancer ADC and EADC values.

Today there is a need for new drug targets for these conditions. The role of ATP receptors in bladder physiology has been studied for some time, primarily in animal models. The aim of this work is to investigate the localization of the ATP receptors P2X2, P2X3 and P2X7 and their colocalization with vimentin and actin in the human urinary bladder.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on full-thickness bladder tissues from fundus and trigonum collected from 15 patients undergoing open radical cystectomy due to chronic cystitis, bladder cancer or locally advanced prostate cancer. Colocalization analyses were performed between the three different P2X subtypes and the structural proteins vimentin and actin. Specimens were examined using epifluorescence microscopy and correlation coefficients were calculated for each costaining as well as the mean distance from the laminin positive basal side of the urothelium to the vimentin positive cells located in the suburothelium.  Results:   P2X2 was expressed in vimentin positive cells located in the suburothelium. Less distinct labelling of P2X2 was also observed in actin positive smooth muscle cells and in the urothelium. P2X3 was expressed in vimentin positive cells surrounding the smooth muscle, and in vimentin positive cells located in the suburothelium. Weaker P2X3 labelling was seen in the urothelium. P2X7 was expressed in the smooth muscle cells and the urothelium. In the suburothelium, cells double positive for P2X2 and vimentin where located closer to the urothelium while cells double positive for P2X3 and vimentin where located further from the urothelium.  Conclusion:   The results from this study demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the expression of the purinergic P2X2, P2X3 and P2X7 receptors in the different histological layers of the human urinary bladder.""","""['Karl Svennersten', 'Katarina Hallén-Grufman', 'Petra J de Verdier', 'N Peter Wiklund', 'Mirjana Poljakovic']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Expression of P2X3 purinoceptors in suburothelial myofibroblasts of the normal human urinary bladder.', 'Inhibition of urothelial P2X3 receptors prevents desensitization of purinergic detrusor contractions in the rat bladder.', 'P2X2 and P2X3 receptor expression in postnatal and adult rat urinary bladder and lumbosacral spinal cord.', 'Purinoceptors as therapeutic targets for lower urinary tract dysfunction.', 'Purinergic signalling in the urinary bladder.', 'Editorial: Novel mechanisms involved in urinary bladder control: Advances in neural, humoral and local factors underlying function and disease, volume II.', 'Protective Effect of Purinergic P2X7 Receptor Inhibition on Acrolein-Induced Urothelial Cell Damage.', 'Eliapixant is a selective P2X3 receptor antagonist for the treatment of\xa0disorders\xa0associated with\xa0hypersensitive\xa0nerve fibers.', 'P2X7 Receptor Blockade Protects Against Acrolein-Induced Bladder Damage: A Potential New Therapeutic Approach for the Treatment of Bladder Inflammatory Diseases.', 'Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Purinergic P2 Receptors in the Mouse Hippocampus.']"""

A Sensitivity Analysis Based on Varying the Target Condition in Template Prostate Mapping Biopsies""","""Objective:   To evaluate the minimum disease burden of prostate cancer at which multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) optimally performs.  Methods:   Between 2006 and 2008, 64 men underwent multiparametric MRI imaging (index test) followed by template prostate mapping biopsy (reference test). Three radiologists independently reported each quadrant of every prostate on a scale of 1 to 5: highly likely benign, likely benign, equivocal, likely malignant, highly likely malignant (≥3 or ≥4 was considered positive). There were 256 prostate sectors; bootstrapping adjustment was used to account for nonindependence. The target condition indicating cancer on biopsies was varied by changing the maximum cancer core length (MCCL) and total cancer core length (TCCL) within each sector from 1 mm to 10 mm. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for each MCCL and TCCL. Gleason ≤3+3 and Gleason ≥3+4 cancers were analyzed separately.  Results:   Mean age was 62 years (range, 40-76 years), and mean prostate-specific antigen level was 8.2 μg/L (range, 2.1-43 μg/L). Fifty percent of quadrants (127 of 256) had prostate cancer, of which 65% (83 of 127) were Gleason ≤3+3. For Gleason ≤3+3, multiparametric MRI had an NPV of ≥95% at an MCCL of ≥5 mm and at a TCCL of ≥7 mm (MRI score ≥3). For Gleason ≥3+4, an NPV of ≥95% was seen at an MCCL of ≥5 mm (MRI score ≥3) and TCCL ≥6 mm.  Conclusion:   Multiparametric MRI may allow areas of the prostate which test negative to avoid biopsy. Whether multiparametric MRI can be used as a ""triage"" test before the first biopsy requires results from ongoing prospective validating cohort studies.""","""['Eleni Anastasiadis', 'Susan C Charman', 'Nimalan Arumainayagam', 'Aslam S Sohaib', 'Clare Allen', 'Alex Freeman', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim U Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Can multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predict upgrading of transrectal ultrasound biopsy results at more definitive histology?', 'Assessing clinically significant prostate cancer: Diagnostic properties of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging compared to three-dimensional transperineal template mapping histopathology.', 'Impact of Lesion Visibility on Transrectal Ultrasound on the Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 3 + 4 or Greater) with Transrectal Ultrasound-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Biopsy.', 'Value of multiparametric MRI in the work-up of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI and prostate cancer diagnosis and risk stratification.', 'Role of mpMRI of the prostate in screening for prostate cancer.']"""

The cytokine IL-6 activates several prostate cancer pathways, but its upstream trans-signaling pathway remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the role of IL-6 in PDCD4 gene expression and how the microRNA miR-21 regulates this process in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. The expression pattern of PDCD4 from samples from human prostate cancer, precancerous lesions, and benign prostatic hyperplasia was investigated by immunohistochemistry. PDCD4 transcription and translation were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The targeted modulation of PDCD4 by miR-21 was analyzed in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, and the effect of IL-6 on the expression of PDCD4 was studied in vitro. PDCD4 expression in samples from the 3 tissue types progressively increased, and the expression levels of PDCD4 and prostate-specific antigen were negatively correlated. The levels of PDCD4 mRNA and protein in PC-3 and LNCaP cells transfected with anti-miR-21 constructs were lower than those in control cells. The expression of PDCD4 was inhibited by IL-6, but this effect was weakened in cell lines with low expression of miR-21. Our study demonstrates that the regulation of PDCD4 by miR-21 is targeted and IL-6 inhibits expression of the PDCD4 gene in PC-3 and LNCaP cells through the targeted function of miR-21 on PDCD4. These findings support the feasibility of future efforts for diagnosis and gene therapy for prostate cancer that are based on IL-6, miR-21, and PDCD4.""","""['Biao Dong', 'Zhihao Shi', 'Jiaping Wang', 'Jing Wu', 'Zhaoqing Yang', 'Kewei Fang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['miR-21 increases the programmed cell death 4 gene-regulated cell proliferation in head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines.', 'Mutations in GAS5 affect the transformation from benign prostate proliferation to aggressive prostate cancer by affecting the transcription efficiency of GAS5.', 'MiR-218 impedes IL-6-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via suppression of LGR4 expression.', 'Targeting strategies on miRNA-21 and PDCD4 for glioblastoma.', 'The mechanisms and clinical significance of PDCD4 in colorectal cancer.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Epigenetic Regulation: A Link between Inflammation and Carcinogenesis.', 'Influence of Androgen Receptor Antagonist MDV3100 Therapy on Rats With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-21a inhibits decidual cell apoptosis by targeting Pdcd4.']"""

Patients and methods:   All patients with a BR (BR definition: nadir prostate-specific antigen, +2 ng/mL) had a multiparametric MRI and FCH PET/CT if there was no clinical sign of relapse. Identification of the relapse was considered positive if both imaging techniques were concordant or in case of pathological relapse confirmation.  Results:   Sixty-five consecutive patients were analyzed. Initial treatment was external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 40), surgery followed by EBRT (n = 11), or brachytherapy (n = 14). Gleason score was 6 in 23 patients, 7 in 35 patients, and 8 to 10 in 7 patients. Median prostate-specific antigen value at the time of relapse was 7.6 ng/mL. Determination of relapse location was identified in 46 patients (70.7%). Relapses were only local in 24 patients (37%), nodal in 16 (24.6%), and distant in 9 (14%). In 4 cases, MRI showed a local relapse not seen by FCH PET/CT. Among the 24 patients with an isolated local relapse, 13 underwent a confirmatory biopsy and 9 were positive. At the end, only 7 patients (11%) could have a salvage local treatment: cryotherapy of the prostate in 6 cases and 1 nodal EBRT.

Here, we have investigated the effect of embelin on the growth of human prostate cancer cells. Embelin strongly inhibited cell growth especially in human prostate cancer cell lines, including PC3, DU145, LNCaP-LN3 and normal prostate epithelial cell, RWPE-1 compared to breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T47D), hepatoma (HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH-7), or choriocarcinoma (JEG-3). We observed that embelin induced apoptosis of PC3 cells in a time-dependent manner correlated with decreased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, increased translocation of Bax into mitochondria, and a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, embelin induced voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 1 expression and oligomerization, which may promote cytochrome c and AIF release. Because embelin was able to inhibit Akt activation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, the effects on Wnt/ β-catenin signaling were determined. Embelin activated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β by preventing phosphorylation and suppressed β-catenin expression. Attenuation of β-catenin-mediated TCF transcriptional activity and gene transcription, such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7, were shown in embelin-treated cells. The changes in β-catenin levels in response to embelin were blocked by lithium chloride, a GSK-3 inhibitor, indicating that embelin may decrease β-catenin expression via GSK-3β activation. Furthermore, exposure of PC3 cells to embelin resulted in a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, these findings suggest that inhibition of Akt signaling and activation of GSK-3β partially contributes to the pro-apoptotic effect of embelin in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Nahee Park', 'Hyoung Seok Baek', 'Young-Jin Chun']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Adiponectin modulates the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway and attenuates mammary tumorigenesis of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice.', 'Anticancer efficacy of deguelin in human prostate cancer cells targeting glycogen synthase kinase-3 β/β-catenin pathway.', 'Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling by genistein: modulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of β-catenin signaling in hormone refractory PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Embelin: a benzoquinone possesses therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer.', 'Lithium and neuropsychiatric therapeutics: neuroplasticity via glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, beta-catenin, and neurotrophin cascades.', 'Simulation-Based Research on Phytoconstituents of Embelia ribes Targeting Proteins with Pathophysiological Implications in Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Protein Levels of Anti-Apoptotic Mcl-1 and the Deubiquitinase USP9x Are Cooperatively Upregulated during Prostate Cancer Progression and Limit Response of Prostate Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy.', 'Anti-tumor Effects of IL-1β Induced TRAIL-Expressing hUCMSCs on Embelin Treated Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Synthesis of Quinoline and Dihydroquinoline Embelin Derivatives as Cardioprotective Agents.', 'Optimization of Extraction Conditions and Cytotoxic Activity of Rapanone in Comparison to Its Homologue, Embelin.']"""

These changes may have direct impact on the cellular interactions with nanocarriers; hence, there is the need for a much-detailed understanding, as nanocarrier cellular internalization and intracellular sorting mechanism correlate directly with bioavailability and clinical efficacy. In this study, we report the differences in the rate and mechanism of cellular internalization of a biocompatible polycaprolactone (PCL)/maltodextrin (MD) nanocarrier system for intracellular drug delivery in LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 PCa cell lines. PCL/MD nanocarriers were designed and characterized. PCL/MD nanocarriers significantly increased the intracellular concentration of coumarin-6 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin, a model hydrophobic and large molecule, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis revealed rapid internalization of the nanocarrier. The extent of nanocarrier cellular internalization correlated directly with cell line aggressiveness. PCL/MD internalization was highest in PC3 followed by DU145 and LNCaP, respectively. Uptake in all PCa cell lines was metabolically dependent. Extraction of endogenous cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced uptake by 75%±4.53% in PC3, 64%±6.01% in LNCaP, and 50%±4.50% in DU145, indicating the involvement of endogenous cholesterol in cellular internalization. Internalization of the nanocarrier in LNCaP was mediated mainly by macropinocytosis and clathrin-independent pathways, while internalization in PC3 and DU145 involved clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-independent pathways, and macropinocytosis. Fluorescence microscopy showed a very diffused and non-compartmentalized subcellular localization of the PCL/MD nanocarriers with possible intranuclear localization and minor colocalization in the lysosomes with time.""","""['Maxwell Korang-Yeboah', 'Yamini Gorantla', 'Simon A Paulos', 'Pankaj Sharma', 'Jaideep Chaudhary', 'Ravi Palaniappan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Intra-tumoral delivery of functional ID4 protein via PCL/maltodextrin nano-particle inhibits prostate cancer growth.', 'Elucidation of cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of heparosan polysaccharide-based micelles in various cancer cells.', 'Internalization and subcellular fate of aptamer and peptide dual-functioned nanoparticles.', 'Polysaccharides as nanocarriers for therapeutic applications.', ""Nanocarriers' entry into the cell: relevance to drug delivery."", 'Encapsulation of Vitamins A and E as Spray-Dried Additives for the Feed Industry.', 'Preclinical evaluation of binimetinib (MEK162) delivered via polymeric nanocarriers in combination with radiation and temozolomide in glioma.', 'Paclitaxel-loaded star-shaped copolymer nanoparticles for enhanced malignant melanoma chemotherapy against multidrug resistance.', 'Intra-tumoral delivery of functional ID4 protein via PCL/maltodextrin nano-particle inhibits prostate cancer growth.', 'Lipid-based oral delivery systems for skin deposition of a potential chemopreventive DIM derivative: characterization and evaluation.']"""

Methods:   Cancer mortality data were collected from local registries using the WHO 10th edition of International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). The direct standardization method was used to address demographic differences in the two regions, with the Standard European Population as reference. Rate ratios (RR) were employed for comparisons and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated according to the Poisson approximation method.  Results:   An increased risk of digestive system cancers (excluding liver neoplasms) was observed in rural versus urban areas (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.02-1.54). Stomach cancer, in particular, was more prevalent in the older cohorts (>65 years), suggesting a historical epidemiological perspective. A more pronounced discrepancy was observed for prostate cancer mortality (RR=1.86, 95%CI=1.10-3.14), indicating a strong positive correlation with rurality.  Conclusions:   Cancer mortality disparities have been observed between rural and urban regions of north-eastern Greece.

Result:   ESR2 rs4986938 AG and AG + AA genotypes were associated with significantly decreased risk of PCa (AG: OR = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.47-0.97, P < 0.05 and AG + AA: OR = 0.67, 95 % CI 0.47-0.94, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between ESR1 rs2234693 and PCa risk. When patients were grouped according to smoking status, the ESR2 rs1256049 AA genotype (OR = 0.48, 95 % CI 0.25-0.95, P < 0.05) and ESR2 rs4986938 AG + AA genotype (OR = 0.64, 95 % CI 0.41-1.00, P < 0.05) showed significantly decreased PCa risk in the ever-smoker group.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that the estrogen receptor ESR2 has a very important function to predict PCa and that different SNPs have different predictive values. Smoking may influence estrogenic activity and may influence PCa together with the estrogen receptor.""","""['Xi Lu', 'Yuko Yamano', 'Hiroyuki Takahashi', 'Masahide Koda', 'Yuki Fujiwara', 'Aya Hisada', 'Wataru Miyazaki', 'Takahiko Katoh']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Environ Health Prev Med""","""['The influence of ESR1 rs9340799 and ESR2 rs1256049 polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk.', 'Estrogen receptors alpha (rs2234693 and rs9340799), and beta (rs4986938 and rs1256049) genes polymorphism in prostate cancer: evidence for association with risk and histopathological tumor characteristics in Iranian men.', 'Genetic polymorphisms of estrogen receptors alpha and beta and the risk of developing prostate cancer.', 'Association of estrogen receptor gene polymorphisms with human precocious puberty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Association Between Genetic Polymorphisms in Estrogen Receptor Genes and the Risk of Ocular Disease: A Meta-Analysis.', 'ESR2 polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between estrogen receptor β polymorphisms and prostate cancer in a Slovak population.', 'A Possible Link of Genetic Variations in ER/IGF1R Pathway and Risk of Melanoma.', 'No Association between Estrogen Receptor-Β Rs4986938 and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Does exposure to asbestos cause prostate cancer?

Currently, diagnostic methods are insufficient to identify patients at risk for aggressive prostate cancer, which is essential for early treatment. Recent data indicate that elevated cholesterol levels in the plasma are a prerequisite for the progression of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed clinical prostate cancer samples for the expression of receptors involved in cellular cholesterol uptake.  Methods:   We screened mRNA microarray files of prostate cancer samples for alterations in the expression levels of cholesterol transporters. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis on human primary prostate cancer tissue sections derived from patients to investigate the correlation of SR-BI with clinicopathological parameters and the mTOR target pS6.  Results:   In contrast to LDLR, we identified SR-BI mRNA and protein expression to be induced in high Gleason grade primary prostate cancers. Histologic analysis of prostate biopsies revealed that 53.6 % of all cancer samples and none of the non-cancer samples showed high SR-BI staining intensity. The disease-free survival time was reduced (P = 0.02) in patients expressing high intra-tumor levels of SR-BI. SR-BI mRNA correlated with HSD17B1 and HSD3B1 and SR-BI protein staining showed correlation with active ribosomal protein S6 (RS = 0.828, P < 0.00001).

Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is also known as a growth factor which activates not only macrophages but also cancer cells and osteoclasts through the activation of the specific Receptor d'origine nantais (RON). Pro-HGF and pro-MSP lack biological activity and, therefore, require proteolytic activation for conversion to an active two-chain form by HGF activator (HGFA). Although, there are several studies on HGF/MET signaling with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone metastasis, reports on plasma protein are rare. In addition, the MSP/RON signaling axis in PC is not well understood. Here, we analyzed associations between PC progression and plasma HGF and MSP levels. We tested plasma samples from 58 patients with PC: 36 with castration-resistant (CR) PC and 22 with pretreatment for PC as control. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to determine plasma levels of HGF, MSP and HGFA, and examined correlations with clinicopathological characteristics such as Gleason grade and bone metastasis. PCR was used to evaluate HGF and MSP-related molecules in PC cell lines. Plasma levels of HGF, MSP and HGFA in the CRPC group were higher than in the control group (HGF: P < 0.001; MSP: P = 0.008; HGFA: P < 0.001). HGF and MSP levels were significantly correlated (P = 0.003). In the CRPC group, plasma HGF and MSP levels and Gleason score were not correlated; however, high plasma MSP level correlated with bone metastasis. (P = 0.016). In cell lines, PC3 expressed significantly more HGF, MET and RON than did LNCaP (P < 0.001), and both cell lines expressed MSP. Plasma concentrations of HGF, MSP and HGFA are significantly elevated in patients with CRPC. Also, as plasma MSP levels are significantly associated with bone metastasis in CRPC patients, MSP may be a candidate for serum marker of bone metastasis.

Inhibition of the PI3K pathway results in upregulation of the MAPK pathway. Therefore, co-administration of inhibitors of both pathways, GSK2126458 as a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, and AZD6244 as a MEK inhibitor, is able to overcome resistance and increase anti-tumor efficacy.  Methods:   PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and CRPC patient-derived cells were used to assess apoptosis upon exposure to the drug combination. The human DU145 and PC3 tumor xenograft mouse model was employed to evaluate in vivo efficacy. CellTiter Glo® luminescent assay, annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection, cell cycle analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted. Statistical evaluation of the results was performed by one-way ANOVA.  Results:   The combination of GSK2126458 and AZD6244 inhibited the growth of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. GSK2126458 decreased phospho-AKT while increasing phospho-ERK and AZD6244 decreased phospho-ERK efficiently while increasing phospho-AKT. The combination of GSK2126458 and AZD6244 decreased both phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK effectively in vitro and in vivo. The combination treatment synergistically induced annexin V-positive cells, sub-G1 cells, and cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) in DU145 cells in vitro. Moreover, the combination decreased the level of Ki-67, and increased TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 in DU145 xenograft tumors implanted in mice. In addition, this combination treatment inhibited both the PI3K and MEK pathway primary in cultures from CRPC patients harboring PTEN loss, leading to synergistic anti-tumor effect.

The Strong Heart Study is a population-based, prospective cohort study with extensive characterization of diabetes status.  Methods:   Among a total cohort of 4,419 participants who were followed for up to 20 years, 430 cancer deaths were identified.  Results:   After adjusting for sex, age, education, smoking status, drinking status, and body mass index, participants with diabetes at baseline showed an increased risk of gastric (HR 4.09; 95% CI 1.42-11.79), hepatocellular (HR 2.94; 95% CI 1.17-7.40), and prostate cancer mortality (HR 3.10; 95% CI 1.22-7.94).

Next, SRF expression was down-regulated by siRNA, resulting in AR increased transcriptional activity in castrate-resistant LNCaP Abl cells but not in the parental LNCaP. This negative feedback loop in the resistant cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry which showed a negative correlation between AR and SRF expression in CRPC bone metastases and a positive correlation in androgen-naïve prostatectomies. Cell proliferation was next assessed following SRF inhibition, demonstrating that SRF inhibition is more effective than AR inhibition in castrate-resistant cells.

Cancer can also adversely impact on psychological wellbeing. Because many prostate cancer-related symptoms and side-effects are potentially modifiable, we investigated associations between symptoms and psychological wellbeing among prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   Postal questionnaires were distributed to men diagnosed with prostate cancer 2-18 years previously identified through cancer registries. General and prostate cancer-specific symptoms were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25, with higher symptom scores indicating more/worse symptomatology. Psychological wellbeing was assessed by the DASS-21. Associations between symptoms and each outcome were investigated using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for socio-demographic and clinical factors.  Results:   A total 3348 men participated (response rate = 54%). Seventeen percent (95%CI 15.2%-17.9%), 16% (95%CI 15.1%-17.8%) and 11% (95%CI 9.5%-11.8%) of survivors scored in the range for depression, anxiety and distress on the DASS scales, respectively. In multivariate models, risk of depression on the DASS scale was significantly higher in men with higher urinary and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-related symptoms, and higher scores for fatigue, insomnia and financial difficulties. Risk of anxiety on the DASS scale was higher in men with higher scores for urinary, bowel and ADT-related symptoms and fatigue, dyspnoea and financial difficulties. Risk of distress on the DASS scale was positively associated with urinary, bowel and ADT-related symptoms, fatigue, insomnia and financial difficulties.

GASC1 is located at human chromosome 9p23-24, where frequent genomic amplification is observed in human esophageal cancer, and its aberrant expression is detected in a variety of human cancers, such as breast, colon, and prostate. Therefore, it is highly likely that GASC1 contributes to the genesis and/or development of cancer. However, there is a lack of direct evidence of GASC1 having an oncogenic function. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of GASC1 in the skin SCC carcinogenesis. For this purpose, we generated Gasc1-heterozygous mice (Gasc1+/-) with reduced expression of Gasc1. On the basis of our results, Gasc1+/- mice displayed a significantly lower incidence and multiplicity of both benign and malignant tumors induced by the two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol than wild-type mice. In addition, the volume of carcinoma was significantly lower in Gasc1+/- mice. Consistent with these observations, knocking down of Gasc1 resulted in reduced cell viability of SCC cells in vitro.

These NPs were studied in chemoradiotherapy, an important cancer treatment paradigm, in the preclinical setting. We demonstrated that Wtmn enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Dtxl and increased the efficiency of radiotherapy (XRT) in H460 lung cancer and PC3 prostate cells in culture. Importantly, we showed that NPs containing both Wtmn and Dtxl release the drugs in a desirable sequential fashion to maximize therapeutic efficacy in comparison to administering each drug alone. An in vivo toxicity study in a murine model validated that NPs containing both Dtxl and Wtmn do not have a high toxicity profile. Lastly, we demonstrated that Dtxl/Wtmn-coencapsulated NPs are more efficient than each single-drug-loaded NPs or a combination of both single-drug-loaded NPs in chemoradiotherapy using xenograft models.

A key mechanism of therapy-resistance is by selection of AR mutations that convert anti-androgens to agonists enabling the retention of androgenic signalling in CRPC. To improve our understanding of these receptors in advanced disease we developed a physiologically-relevant model to analyse the global functionality of AR mutants in CRPC. Using the bicalutamide-activated AR(W741L/C) mutation as proof of concept, we demonstrate that this mutant confers an androgenic-like signalling programme and growth promoting phenotype in the presence of bicalutamide. Transcriptomic profiling of AR(W741L) highlighted key genes markedly up-regulated by the mutant receptor, including TIPARP, RASD1 and SGK1. Importantly, SGK1 expression was found to be highly expressed in the KUCaP xenograft model and a CRPC patient biopsy sample both of which express the bicalutamide-activated receptor mutant.

We evaluated PSA data from nonmetastatic (M0) prostate cancer patients treated at urology and oncology clinics across the United States (US) to describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who met CRPC and high-risk criteria.  Materials and methods:   We identified M0 prostate cancer patients aged = 18 years receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in 2011 from electronic health records (EHR), covering 129 urology and 64 oncology practices across the US. We estimated the proportion of prostate cancer patients with evidence of CRPC (consecutive rising PSAs) and subsets that may be at high risk (using several PSA and PSADT cut-points).  Results:   Among 3121 M0 prostate cancer patients actively treated with ADT, 1188 (38%) had evidence of CRPC. Of these, 712 (60%) qualified as high risk in 2011 based on PSADT < 8 months (equivalent to = 8 months in these data). Men = 65 years were more likely to have evidence of CRPC than younger men, although younger men were more likely to have evidence of high-risk disease. CRPC was more common among men receiving ADT in the oncology setting than the urology setting (48% versus 37%).  Conclusions:   In this large EHR study with patient-level PSA data, 38% of men with M0 prostate cancer treated with ADT had CRPC.

Image-based dosimetric studies remain challenging because the emitted photons are few. The aim of this study was to implement a methodology for in-vivo quantitative planar imaging, and to assess the absorbed dose to lesions using the MIRD approach.  Methods:   The study included nine Caucasian patients with 24 lesions (6 humeral head lesions, 4 iliac wing lesions, 2 scapular lesions, 5 trochanter lesions, 3 vertebral lesions, 3 glenoid lesions, 1 coxofemoral lesion). The treatment consisted of six injections (one every 4 weeks) of 50 kBq per kg body weight. Gamma-camera calibrations for (223)Ra included measurements of sensitivity and transmission curves. Patients were statically imaged for 30 min, using an MEGP collimator, double-peak acquisition, and filtering to improve the image quality. Lesions were delineated on (99m)Tc-MDP whole-body images, and the ROIs superimposed on the (223)Ra images after image coregistration. The activity was quantified with background, attenuation, and scatter correction. Absorbed doses were assessed deriving the S values from the S factors for soft-tissue spheres of OLINDA/EXM, evaluating the lesion volumes by delineation on the CT images.  Results:   In 12 lesions with a wash-in phase the biokinetics were assumed to be biexponential, and to be monoexponential in the remainder. The optimal timing for serial acquisitions was between 1 and 5 h, between 18 and 24 h, between 48 and 60 h, and between 7 and 15 days. The error in cumulated activity neglecting the wash-in phase was between 2 % and 12 %. The mean effective half-life (T 1/2eff) of (223)Ra was 8.2 days (range 5.5-11.4 days). The absorbed dose (D) after the first injection was 0.7 Gy (range 0.2-1.9 Gy. Considering the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of alpha particles (RBE = 5), D RBE = 899 mGy/MBq (range 340-2,450 mGy/MBq). The percent uptake of (99m)Tc and (223)Ra (activity extrapolated to t = 0) were significantly correlated.

The D RBE to lesions per unit administered activity was much higher than that of other bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals, but considering a standard administration of 21 MBq (six injections of 50 kBq/kg to a 70-kg patient), the mean cumulative value of D RBE was about 19 Gy, and was therefore in the range of those of other radiopharmaceuticals.

Cohort consisted of 10,509 men aged 66 or older and diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer between 2001and 2004. The cohort was followed retrospectively up to 2009. Racial/ethnic variation in cost was analyzed using 2 part-models and quantile regression. Step-wise GLM log-link and Cox regression was used to study the association between race/ethnicity and cost and mortality. Propensity score approach was used to minimize selection bias.Pattern of cost and mortality varies between racial/ethnic groups. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, non-Hispanic white patients had higher unadjusted costs in treatment and follow-up phases. Quintile regression results indicated that in treatment phase, Hispanics had higher costs in the 95th quantile and non-Hispanic blacks had lower cost in the 95th quantile, compared with non-Hispanic white men. In terminal phase non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had higher cost. After controlling for treatment, all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality was not significant for non-Hispanic black men, compared with non-Hispanic white men. However, for Asians, mortality remained significantly lower compared with non-Hispanic white men.In conclusion, relationship between race/ethnicity, cost of care, and mortality is intricate. For non-Hispanic black men, disparity in mortality can be attributed to treatment differences. To reduce racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer care and outcomes, tailored policies to address underuse, overuse, and misuse of treatment and health services are necessary.""","""['Sumedha Chhatre', 'Stanley Bruce Malkowicz', 'J Sanford Schwartz', 'Ravishankar Jayadevappa']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Race/ethnicity and the receipt of watchful waiting for the initial management of prostate cancer.', 'Racial disparity and socioeconomic status in association with survival in older men with local/regional stage prostate carcinoma: findings from a large community-based cohort.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes: a systematic review.', 'Prostate cancer in black and white Americans.', 'Continuity of care and advanced prostate cancer.', 'Genetic Evaluation for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes Among African Americans: A Critical Review.', 'Racial disparities in the utilization of parathyroidectomy among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: Evidence from a nationwide analysis of Medicare claims.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparity, Chemoprevention, and Treatment by Specific Medicinal Plants.', 'Survival by Hispanic ethnicity among patients with cancer participating in SWOG clinical trials.']"""

Some studies suggest that occupational exposure may be associated with prostate cancer. However, the etiology of prostate cancer is ambiguous. The purpose of this study was to assess the rural occupational exposure, including farming, as a determinant of prostate cancer in rural men. We investigated the prevalence of prostate cancer and its putative relationship between rural exposures in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.  Methods:   In 2010, a baseline mailed survey was conducted of 11,982 households located in 4 geographic regions (southwest, southeast, northwest, and northeast) of rural Saskatchewan, Canada. The questionnaires collected information on individual and contextual determinants from a rural population of men. In total 2,938 males older than 45 years were included in the logistic regression analysis.  Findings:   The age-standardized prevalence of prostate cancer was 3.32%. Farm residence was a significant risk factor associated with prevalence of prostate cancer while farming occupation and duration were not. Men who were exposed to insecticides and fungicides together (OR [95% CI] = 2.23 [1.15-4.33], P = .02) at work showed an increased potential risk compared to the nonexposed. The effect of farm/nonfarm residence on prevalence of prostate cancer differed depending on personal smoking history and family history of cancer.

Two coders independently evaluated website content for accessibility and quality. We screened 120 websites and identified 40 unique sites for analysis. Overall, 85% [95% confidence interval (CI), 70%-94%] of sites mentioned clinical trials on the landing page and 68% (51%-81%) included links to specific trials. Overall readability was poor.

DNA methylation modification, one of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression, is considered a hallmark of cancer. Human and animal models have identified numerous links between DNA methylation and inflammatory biomarkers. Our objective was to prospectively and longitudinally examine associations between methylation of four inflammatory genes and cancer risk.  Methods:   We included 795 Normative Aging Study participants with blood drawn one to four times from 1999 to 2012 (median follow-up, 10.6 years). Promoter DNA methylation of IL6, ICAM-1, IFN, and TLR2 in blood leukocytes was measured using pyrosequencing at multiple CpG sites and averaged by gene for data analysis. We used Cox regression models to examine prospective associations of baseline and time-dependent methylation with cancer risk and compared mean methylation differences over time between cancer cases and cancer-free participants.  Results:   Baseline IFN hypermethylation was associated with all-cancer (HR, 1.49; P = 0.04) and prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.69; P = 0.02). Baseline ICAM-1 and IL6 hypermethylation were associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.43; P = 0.02; HR, 0.70; P = 0.03, respectively). In our time-dependent analyses, IFN hypermethylation was associated with all-cancer (HR, 1.79; P = 0.007) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.57; P = 0.03) incidence; and ICAM-1 and IL6 hypermethylation were associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.39; P = 0.02; HR, 0.69; P = 0.03, respectively). We detected significant ICAM-1 hypermethylation in cancer cases (P = 0.0003) 10 to 13 years prediagnosis.  Conclusion:   Hypermethylation of IFN and ICAM-1 may play important roles in early carcinogenesis, particularly that of prostate cancer.  Impact:   These methylation changes could inform the development of early detection biomarkers and potential treatments of inflammation-related carcinogenesis.""","""['Brian Thomas Joyce', 'Tao Gao', 'Lei Liu', 'Yinan Zheng', 'Siran Liu', 'Wei Zhang', 'Frank Penedo', 'Qi Dai', 'Joel Schwartz', 'Andrea A Baccarelli', 'Lifang Hou']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Genetic variants of methyl metabolizing enzymes and epigenetic regulators: associations with promoter CpG island hypermethylation in colorectal cancer.', 'Promoter hypermethylation of the 14-3-3 sigma, SYK and CAGE-1 genes is related to the various phenotypes of urinary bladder carcinomas and associated with progression of transitional cell carcinomas.', 'DNA Methylation of Telomere-Related Genes and Cancer Risk.', 'DNA methylation of channel-related genes in cancers.', 'Clinicopathological Significance of CDKN2A Promoter Hypermethylation Frequency with Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Crosstalk between miRNAs and DNA Methylation in Cancer.', 'Whole genome methylation combined with RNA-seq reveals the protective effects of Gualou-Xiebai herb pair in foam cells through DNA methylation mediated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.', 'Machine Learning Approaches to Classify Primary and Metastatic Cancers Using Tissue of Origin-Based DNA Methylation Profiles.', 'Identification of methylated-differentially expressed genes and pathways in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Association of smoking habits with TXNIP DNA methylation levels in leukocytes among general Japanese population.']"""

Understanding the sources of variability in the cost of radiation therapy is critical to evaluating the efficiency of the current reimbursement system and could shape future policy reform. This study defines the magnitude and sources of variation in the cost of radiation therapy for a large cohort of Medicare beneficiaries.  Patients and methods:   We identified 55,288 patients within the SEER database diagnosed with breast, lung, or prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009. The cost of radiation therapy was estimated from Medicare reimbursements. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the influence of patient, tumor, and radiation therapy provider characteristics on variation in cost of radiation therapy.  Results:   For breast, lung, and prostate cancers, the median cost (interquartile range) of a course of radiation therapy was $8,600 ($7,300 to $10,300), $9,000 ($7,500 to $11,100), and $18,000 ($11,300 to $25,500), respectively. For all three cancer subtypes, patient- or tumor-related factors accounted for < 3% of the variation in cost. Factors unrelated to the patient, including practice type, geography, and individual radiation therapy provider, accounted for a substantial proportion of the variation in cost, ranging from 44% with breast, 43% with lung, and 61% with prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   In this study, factors unrelated to the individual patient accounted for the majority of variation in the cost of radiation therapy, suggesting potential inefficiency in health care expenditure. Future research should determine whether this variability translates into improved patient outcomes for further evaluation of current reimbursement practices.""","""['Anthony J Paravati', 'Isabel J Boero', 'Daniel P Triplett', 'Lindsay Hwang', 'Rayna K Matsuno', 'Beibei Xu', 'Loren K Mell', 'James D Murphy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['The Role of Patient Factors, Cancer Characteristics, and Treatment Patterns in the Cost of Care for Medicare Beneficiaries with Breast Cancer.', 'Out-of-pocket health care expenditure burden for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.', 'Area-level variations in cancer care and outcomes.', 'Comparison of approaches for estimating incidence costs of care for colorectal cancer patients.', 'Understanding regional variation in Medicare expenditures for initial episodes of prostate cancer care.', 'Association Between Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Use and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Among Elderly Patients with Breast, Lung, or Prostate Cancer.', 'Health care costs for adolescents and young adults with cancer: a Wisconsin community-based hospital study between 2005 and 2020.', 'The Role of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Patient-Centered Cancer Care in the Era of Precision Medicine.', 'Association between Site-of-Care and the Cost and Modality of Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Analysis of Medicare Beneficiaries from 2015 to 2017.', 'Automated contouring and planning pipeline for hippocampal-avoidant whole-brain radiotherapy.']"""

In this study we evaluate how the Gleason score and positive surgical margin length correlate with the grade and adverse pathological characteristics of the final specimen, and whether the positive surgical margin Gleason score affects the risk of early biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   A total of 4,082 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2010 and 2014 for localized prostate cancer were included in the study, of whom 405 had a Gleason score of 7 or greater of the primary nodule and a positive surgical margin with the length and Gleason score recorded at the margin. Concordance rates between the Gleason score at the margin and the final pathological specimen were compared. Logistic regression models were used to predict the risk of unfavorable pathology. Cox proportional hazards models controlling for Gleason score, preoperative prostate specific antigen, pathological stage and adjuvant radiation were used to predict biochemical recurrence, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival were calculated by Gleason score.  Results:   Among patients with positive margins biochemical recurrence was identified in 22% (vs 5.6% without positive margins), metastases in 3% (vs 0.5%) and adjuvant radiation in 30% (vs 4.1%). Mean followup was 22 months (range 12 to 48). The Gleason score at the positive surgical margin was the same as the final pathology specimen in 44% of patients, and a lower Gleason score in 56% of patients. A shorter positive surgical margin was independently associated with a lower Gleason score at the margin (p=0.02). Kaplan-Meier estimates demonstrated improved freedom from biochemical recurrence among patients with a lower Gleason score at the margin. In multivariate Cox models having a lower grade margin was associated with a decreased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR 0.50, OR 0.25-0.97).  Conclusions:   A lower Gleason score at the positive surgical margin is independently associated with a shorter margin length and a decreased risk of early biochemical recurrence.

However, progression of PCa cells to androgen independent growth (castrate resistant prostate cancer, CRPC) results in relapse and mortality. Hypoxia, a microenvironment of low oxygen that modifies the activity of PCa regulatory proteins including the androgen receptor (AR), plays a critical role in progression to CRPC. Therapies targeting hypoxia and the AR may lengthen the time to CRPC progression thereby increasing survival time of PCa patients. Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV) has shown promise for the treatment of prostate tumors in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that MRV infection induces downregulation of proteins implicated in CRPC progression, interferes with hypoxia-induced AR activity, and induces apoptosis in androgen dependent cells.

A total of 302 patients with LNM were retrospectively reviewed (1988-2003) and stratified according to cN status on the basis of preoperative imaging.

All miRNAs in human body are not equally important for cancer identification. We propose a methodology, called FMIMS, which automatically selects the most relevant miRNAs for a particular type of cancer. In FMIMS, miRNAs are initially grouped by using a SVM-based algorithm; then the group with highest relevance is determined and the miRNAs in that group are finally ranked for selection according to their redundancy. Fuzzy mutual information is used in computing the relevance of a group and the redundancy of miRNAs within it. Superiority of the most relevant group to all others, in deciding normal or cancer, is demonstrated on breast, renal, colorectal, lung, melanoma and prostate data. The merit of FMIMS as compared to several existing methods is established. While 12 out of 15 selected miRNAs by FMIMS corroborate with those of biological investigations, three of them viz., ""hsa-miR-519,"" ""hsa-miR-431"" and ""hsa-miR-320c"" are possible novel predictions for renal cancer, lung cancer and melanoma, respectively.

There are controversies regarding the role of the alternative splicing forms of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase. Therefore, the correlation between telomerase enzyme activity, the abundance of alternatively spliced variants of hTERT and doubling time of a series of cancer cell lines originated from hematopoietic, breast, colorectal, neural, ovarian, lung, kidney, bladder, prostate and head and neck cancers were investigated. Expression levels of four different variants of hTERT (the full length, α-deletion, β-deletion and α/β-deletion) were quantitatively measured by real time PCR. Telomerase activity was determined by the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) while doubling time of the cells measured by plotting growth curves. Results showed high diversity in the relative proportions of hTERT transcripts while the majority of the cells expressed the full length variant as the main transcript. Telomerase activity could not be detected in all cells. Relative assessment of hTERT expression showed greater expression of the α-deleted variant in the telomerase negative cells (P= 0.04). Those cells possessed the α/β-deleted variant to a smaller extent when compared to the cells with telomerase activity. Greater association between full length spliced variant and β-variant expression was observed in cells presenting telomerase activity (P= 0.0007, r= 0.74). High degrees of variation among the studied cells regarding the pattern of hTERT expression were present. In spite that, the regulatory roles of hTERT on telomerase activity is still a potential to be utilized as targets for cancer therapies.""","""['Mohsen Khosravi-Maharlooei', 'Mansooreh Jaberipour', 'Ahmad Hosseini Tashnizi', 'Armin Attar', 'Fatemeh Amirmoezi', 'Mojtaba Habibagahi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Mol Cell Med""","""['Changes of telomerase activity by alternative splicing of full-length and beta variants of hTERT in breast cancer patients.', 'Quantification of hTERT splice variants in melanoma by SYBR green real-time polymerase chain reaction indicates a negative regulatory role for the beta deletion variant.', 'Correlations between the expression of hTERT and α and β splice variants in human brain tumors.', 'Physiological and pathological significance of human telomerase reverse transcriptase splice variants.', 'The Role of Alternative RNA Splicing in the Regulation of hTERT, Telomerase, and Telomeres: Implications for Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Noncanonical Role of Telomerase in Regulation of Microvascular Redox Environment With Implications for Coronary Artery Disease.', 'Alternative Splicing of Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) and Its Implications in Physiological and Pathological Processes.', 'The Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Control on Cardiovascular Outcomes Based on 10-Year ASCVD Risk Score: An Analysis of a Clinical Trial.', 'Analysis of TERT Isoforms across TCGA, GTEx and CCLE Datasets.', 'Characterisation of the novel spontaneously immortalized and invasively growing human skin keratinocyte line HaSKpw.']"""

Methods:   Thirty paired fresh PCa samples were analyzed for Tra2β expression by Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was performed in 160 PCa samples after radical prostatectomy and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Tra2β protein expression was divided into high expression group and low expression group by IHC. We also investigated the association of Tra2β expression with clinical and pathologic parameters. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the association between Tra2β protein expression and prognosis of PCa patients. Our results showed that Tra2β was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues by western blot and IHC.  Results:   Our data indicated that high expression of Tra2β was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), clinical stage (P=0.015), preoperative prostate-specific antigen (P=0.003), Gleason score (P=0.001), and biochemical recurrence (P=0.021). High Tra2β expression was a significant predictor of poor biochemical recurrence free survival and overall survival both in univariate and multivariate analysis.

Pre-biopsy prophylaxis with fluoroquinolone (FQL) antibiotics is a recommended and accepted practice. Increasing emergence of FQL-resistant bacteria is believed to be related to the increase in infectious complications. We sought to determine the effect of targeted antibiotic prophylaxis (TAP) before TRUSBx on infectious complications in our practice.  Methods:   TAP was introduced in our practice in 2012. A retrospective analysis was performed analyzing infectious complications from TRUSBx before and after TAP was introduced. Two hundred forty-four patients underwent TRUSBx with TAP directed by bacterial antibiotic sensitivity identified on rectal swab. A group of two hundred sixty-four consecutive patients who underwent TRUSBx in our practice before introduction of TAP were chosen for comparison. Infectious complications were recorded and compared between groups. Prostate volume, PSA, number of biopsy cores, finding of prostate cancer, presence of diabetes, race and age were also compared.  Results:   The infectious complication rate after TRUSBx in the pre-TAP group was 7/264 (2.65%), the rate in the TAP group was 1/244 (0.41%), a statistically significant difference (P=<0.05). There were no differences between groups in regards to prostate volume, number of prostate biopsy cores, race and presence of diabetes. The rectal swab group was younger (65.4 ± 6.0) than the non-swab group (67.9 ± 6.2), had higher PSA values, and a higher chance of prostate cancer on biopsy.  Conclusions:   The use of TAP based on rectal swab testing significantly lowered our infectious complication rate for TRUSBx. TAP is now adopted as standard practice before TRUSBx in our center. The younger age and higher chance of prostate cancer on biopsy in the rectal swab group, we believe, is due to implementation of recent guidelines directing urologists be more selective in recommending prostate biopsy to older men.""","""['I Cook', 'J B Angel', 'P L Vera', 'J Demos', 'D Preston']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Ciprofloxacin resistance in the faecal carriage of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Povidone-iodine rectal cleansing and targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis using rectal swab cultures in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy are associated with reduced incidence of postoperative infectious complications.', 'Targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis using rectal swab cultures in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative infectious complications and cost of care.', 'The role of targeted prophylactic antimicrobial therapy before transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy in reducing infection rates: a systematic review.', 'Prevention of infectious complications after prostate biopsy procedure.', 'Role of Prophylactic Antibiotics in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Dutasteride is associated with reduced risk of transrectal prostate biopsy-associated urinary tract infection and related hospitalizations.', 'Rectal Culture-Guided Targeted Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Reduces the Incidence of Post-Operative Infectious Complications in Men at High Risk for Infections Submitted to Transrectal Ultrasound Prostate Biopsy - Results of a Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Cutting to the Core of the Issue: Emerging Strategies To Reduce Prostate Biopsy-Related Infections.']"""

However, in early clinical trials, men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer did not respond to PD-1 blockade as a monotherapy. One explanation for this unresponsiveness could be that prostate tumors generally do not express programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), the primary ligand for PD-1. However, lack of PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer would be surprising, given that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is relatively common in prostate cancer and several studies have shown that PTEN loss correlates with PD-L1 upregulation--constituting a mechanism of innate immune resistance. This study tested whether prostate cancer cells were capable of expressing PD-L1, and whether the rare PD-L1 expression that occurs in human specimens correlates with PTEN loss.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines were evaluated for PD-L1 expression and loss of PTEN by flow cytometry and western blotting, respectively. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for PTEN was correlated with PD-L1 IHC using a series of resected human prostate cancer samples.  Results:   In vitro, many prostate cancer cell lines upregulated PD-L1 expression in response to inflammatory cytokines, consistent with adaptive immune resistance. In these cell lines, no association between PTEN loss and PD-L1 expression was apparent. In primary prostate tumors, PD-L1 expression was rare, and was not associated with PTEN loss.  Conclusions:   These studies show that some prostate cancer cell lines are capable of expressing PD-L1. However, in human prostate cancer, PTEN loss is not associated with PD-L1 expression, arguing against innate immune resistance as a mechanism that mitigates antitumor immune responses in this disease.""","""['A M Martin', 'T R Nirschl', 'C J Nirschl', 'B J Francica', 'C M Kochel', 'A van Bokhoven', 'A K Meeker', 'M S Lucia', 'R A Anders', 'A M DeMarzo', 'C G Drake']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog and programmed cell death ligand 1 in adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung.', '5-Fluorouracil upregulates cell surface B7-H1 (PD-L1) expression in gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Programmed Death Ligand 1 Indicates Pre-Existing Adaptive Immune Response by Tumor-Infiltrating CD8+ T Cells in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Roles of PTEN inactivation and PD-1/PD-L1 activation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1 expression and prognostic relevance in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a summary of immunohistochemical studies.', 'Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in cancer immunotherapy: An effective strategy for treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.', 'Regulation of PD-L1 Trafficking from Synthesis to Degradation.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Engineered human pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer cells with PD-L1 responsive immunological memory for enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy.', 'BLEACH&STAIN 15-marker Multiplexed Imaging in 3,098 Human Carcinomas Reveals Six Major PD-L1-driven Immune Phenotypes with Distinct Spatial Orchestration.']"""

The relationship between the possibility of PCa with the following variables including: age; PSA level, prostate volume (by transabdominal ultrasound or transrectal ultrasound) and digital rectal examination (DRE) finding. We calculated a predictive scoring equation to predict the possibility of PCa using chi-square analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, multiple logistic regression and ROC curve. Then, we designed an application for predicting prostate cancer risk called Indonesian Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (IPCRC).  Results:   there were 784 PCa and 1173 BPH patients were used for developing the risk calculator in our study.

We included age, PSA level, abnormal DRE finding (all showed significant p<0.05 in univariate model). Additionally, although not significant, we included prostate volume (p=0.157) due to its clinical importance. The corrected ROC analysis showed AUC 0.935, sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity 80% in predicting the prostate cancer in our population.

A comparative analysis""","""Objectives:   To assess the degree of upgrading and increase in clinical risk category of transperineal template biopsy (TTB) compared with transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSB). Upgrading of TRUSB Gleason grade and sum after radical prostatectomy (RP) is well recognised. TTB may offer a more thorough mapping of the prostate than TRUSB, as well as a more accurate assessment of the tumour. In this retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data, we compare the initial TRUSB and TTB Gleason grade and sum with the final assessment at RP.  Patients and methods:   Following Ethics Committee approval, 431 laparoscopic and robotic RP specimens of two urologists, fellowship-trained in minimally invasive RP, were examined in the private sector between April 2009 and October 2013. Final RP Gleason grade and sum were compared with the initial prostate biopsy. All pathological assessments were performed by a dedicated uropathology unit, experienced in prostate pathology. Upgrading was defined either as an increase in the primary Gleason grade, or as identification of a higher grade tertiary pattern at final RP analysis. Increase in clinical risk category was defined as an increase from low- (Gleason ≤6), to either intermediate- (Gleason 7) or high-risk disease (Gleason 8-10); or as an increase from intermediate- to high-risk disease. The chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables, while the Wilcoxon rank sum was used for continuous quantitative variables.  Results:   The 431 RP specimens comprised 283 in which the prostate cancer was diagnosed at TRUSB and 148 diagnosed at TTB. There was no difference between TRUSB and TTB in mean prostate weight (46.4 vs 44.2 g), final RP pathological stage (pT2: 187 vs 102; pT3 97 vs 48; P = 0.65) or mean tumour volume (2.15 vs 2.14 mL). Overall, 33.22% of TRUSB and 30.41% of TTB were upgraded, which was not significantly different (P = 0.55). Similarly there was no difference in whether there was an increase to a higher Gleason sum (TRUSB 23.3% vs TTB 20.9%; P = 0.57). TTB was more reflective of the actual clinical risk category, with TRUSB more likely to show an increase in clinical risk (TRUSB 22.3% vs TTB 14.2%; P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   In this series, TTB more accurately predicted clinical risk category than TRUSB. TTB should be considered before active surveillance, to ensure that occult higher risk disease has not been under diagnosed. Upgrading and increase in clinical risk category was relatively common in each group highlighting the need for improved pretreatment staging accuracy.""","""['Susan Scott', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Charles Chabert', 'Michelle Breckenridge', 'Troy Gianduzzo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'What Are the Predictive Factors for Gleason Score Upgrade following RP?', 'Risk factors for Gleason Score upgrading following radical prostatectomy.', 'Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsy to determine potential candidates for focal therapy.', 'Utility of multiple core biopsies during transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy for patients with large prostates and PI-RADS 1-2 on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Safety and feasibility of freehand transperineal prostate biopsy under local anesthesia: Our initial experience.', 'Gleason grade accuracy of transperineal and transrectal prostate biopsies in MRI-naïve patients.', 'Optimal biopsy approach for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

We engaged patients, providers, and design experts in human-centered design of ""PRO dashboards"" that illustrate trends in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reported by patients following prostate cancer treatment.  Materials and methods:   We designed and assessed the feasibility of integrating dashboards into care in 3 steps: (1) capture PRO needs of patients and providers through focus groups and interviews; (2) iteratively build and refine a prototype dashboard; and (3) pilot test dashboards with patients and their provider during follow-up care.  Results:   Focus groups (n = 60 patients) prioritized needs for dashboards that compared longitudinal trends in patients' HRQOL with ""men like me."" Of the candidate dashboard designs, 50 patients and 50 providers rated pictographs less helpful than bar charts, line graphs, or tables (P < .001) and preferred bar charts and line graphs most. Given these needs and the design recommendations from our Patient Advisory Board (n = 7) and design experts (n = 7), we built and refined a prototype that charts patients' HRQOL compared with age- and treatment-matched patients in personalized dashboards. Pilot testing dashboard use (n = 12 patients) improved compliance with quality indicators for prostate cancer care (P < .01).  Conclusion:   PRO dashboards are a promising approach for integrating patient-generated data into prostate cancer care.

Early detection and treatment of recurrence improves the outcome of salvage treatment. We investigated the ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion-guided biopsy (FGB) combined with ""cognitive biopsy"" to confirm local recurrence of prostate cancer after RP.  Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study conducted between January 2010 and December 2014, patients with rising PSA levels after RP who had no known evidence of distant metastases underwent mpMRI including T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI at 3 Tesla, and subsequent MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy with cognitive assistance. The detection rate of locally recurrent disease was determined.  Results:   A total of 10 patients (mean age = 67y, mean PSA level = 3.44ng/ml) met the inclusion criteria. Of the 10 patients, all had positive findings suspicious for local recurrence on mpMRI per entrance criterion. The most important features on mpMRI were early enhancement on DCE MR images and hypointensity on T2W images. The average lesion diameter on mpMRI was 1.12cm (range: 0.40-2.20cm). All suspicious lesions (16/16, 100%) were positive on T2W MR images, 14 (89%) showed positive features on apparent diffusion coefficient maps of diffusion-weighted images, and 16 (100%) were positive on DCE MR images.

We evaluated the effect of a close surgical margin (CSM) on biochemical recurrence (BCR) compared to a negative margin after RP.  Materials and methods:   Pathologic records of men who underwent RP from 2005-2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Margin status was classified as ""positive"" (PSM), ""negative"" (NSM), or ""close"" (<1mm from margin). BCR was defined as 2 consecutive postoperative prostate specific antigen measurements >0.2ng/ml. Probability of BCR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and stratified by margin status. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether close margin status was associated with an increased rate of BCR.  Results:   A total of 609 consecutive patients underwent RP (93% robotic) and had complete pathologic data. A total of 126 (20.7%) had PSM, 453 (74.4%) had NSM, and 30 (4.9%) had CSM (mean<0.44mm). The 3-year BCR-free survival for patients with CSM was similar to those with PSM (70.4% vs. 74.5%, log rank P = 0.66) and significantly worse than those with NSM (90%, log rank P<0.001). On multivariable regression, positive margin status (HR = 3.26, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a higher risk of BCR, along with close margins (HR = 2.7, P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   BCR for patients with CSM at RP is tantamount to PSM patients. CSM <1mm should be explicitly noted on pathology reports. Patients with this finding should be followed up closely and offered adjuvant therapy.""","""['Michael J Whalen', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Michael B Rothberg', 'Andrew T Turk', 'Solomon L Woldu', 'Arindam Roy Choudhury', 'Trushar Patel', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Short (≤ 1 mm) positive surgical margin and risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive margin length and highest Gleason grade of tumor at the margin predict for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Impact of margin status at 37 months after robot assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Factors affecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in patients with positive and negative surgical margin.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Prostate cancer: Of margins and men--do surgical margins matter?']"""

We investigated the effect of PM on the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene that codes for the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme complex in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by PM in both cell lines was associated with the inhibition of hTERT mRNA expression, suppression of native and phosphorylated hTERT protein and hTERT telomerase activity. The ablation of hTERT expression increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to PM. In addition, results also revealed that the inhibition of hTERT expression is attributed to the inhibition of transcription factors SP1, c-Myc and STAT3 and protein kinase B/Akt which regulate hTERT transcriptionally and post-translationally, respectively.

It has previously been shown that there is a relationship between C/T polymorphism at 1595 position in exon 5 of the TRAIL gene and cancer however rapidly accumulating data cannot be extrapolated to other populations due to intra- and inter-ethnic variability. The study is focused on the C/T polymorphism at 1595 position in exon 5 of the TRAIL gene in prostate cancer patients diagnosed in local population in Pakistan. 126 prostate cancer patients and 91 control subjects participated in this study. 5ml venous blood was taken from participants with informed consent.

The results were statistically evaluated in SPSS14. In this particular study it was found that there was no significant difference in major allele C genotype between patients and controls, p value > 0.05.

The aim of the present study was to prospectively validate these results on an external dataset.  Materials and methods:   In total, 346 patients undergoing RARP as first-line therapy for localized prostate cancer were included. Clinical and histopathological parameters, criteria of IPLC, and pGS were recorded prospectively. Potential association between IPLC and pGS was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   IPLC was found in 77.2% (n = 267) of all patients with a median leukocyte blood count (LBC) of 12.5 × 10(9)/L (interquartile range, 10.2-15 × 10(9)/L). Of these, in 255 patients IPLC was found within the range of 10-20 × 10(9)/L, whereas an IPLC of >20 × 10(9)/L was found in only 12 patients. Of the patients, 49.1%, 40.5%, and 10.4% presented with a pGS6, pGS7, and pGS8-10 tumor, respectively. There was neither a univariate nor a multivariate correlation between IPLC and pGS. Furthermore, no significant correlation could be detected between IPLC and other clinical, intraoperative, or histopathological criteria. In 175 (66%) patients with IPLC normal LBC levels were measured on postoperative Day 4.  Conclusions:   IPLC was not associated with more favorable tumor biology (lower pGS, better tumor stage) and not influenced by patient conditions (age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, smoking) or intraoperative parameters (blood loss, operating time, surgeon).

Materials and methods:   First, single-voxel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spectra were acquired from voxels consisting entirely of tumor, as defined on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI and from a biopsy-positive octant, at TEs of 32 msec and 100 msec in 26 prostate cancer patients. Then, in a separate cohort of 26 patients, single-voxel TE = 32 msec MR spectroscopy (MRS) was performed over a partial-tumor region and a matching, contralateral normal-appearing region, defined similarly. Metabolite depiction was compared between TEs using Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB), and absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated from TE = 32 msec spectra referenced to unsuppressed water spectra.  Results:   Citrate and spermine resonances in tumor were better depicted (had significantly lower CRLB) at TE = 32 msec, while the choline resonance was better depicted at TE = 100 msec. Citrate and spermine concentrations were significantly lower in patients of more advanced stage, significantly lower in Gleason grade 3+4 than 3+3 tumors, and significantly lower than expected from the tumor fraction in partial-tumor voxels (by 14 mM and 4 mM, respectively, P < 0.05).

Methods:   Patients with stage I-II prostate cancer and their spouses (N = 159 couples) were recruited from a urology clinic and completed questionnaires at diagnosis, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post prostatectomy on demographics, mental and physical health quality of life, and relationship satisfaction. The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model was employed to examine effects of each partners' mental and physical health on their own and their partner's relationship satisfaction.  Results:   Patients and spouses had declined mental and physical health at 1 month post-surgery. Health improved at 6 and 12 months but did not fully return to pre-surgery levels. Actor effects showed that patient's physical health consistently predicted own relationship satisfaction. Both patient's and spouse's mental health consistently related to their own relationship satisfaction. Partner effects showed that patient's and spouse's physical health had an effect on each other's relationship satisfaction at 1 month. Spouse's mental health predicted patient's relationship satisfaction throughout the year following treatment.

However, the role of ErbB-2 in regulating androgen-sensitive (AS) and castration-resistant (CR) cell proliferation remains unclear. Here, we determined the role of ErbB-2 in PCa progression and survival under steroid-reduced conditions using two independent PCa cell progression models. In AR-positive androgen-independent (AI) PCa cells that exhibit the CR phenotype, ErbB-2 was constitutively activated, compared to corresponding AS PCa cells. In AS LNCaP C-33 cells, androgen-induced ErbB-2 activation through ERK1/2 mediates PCa cell proliferation. Further, the ErbB-2-specific but not EGFR-specific inhibitor suppresses basal and androgen-stimulated cell proliferation and also blocks ERK1/2 activation. ErbB-2 ectopic expression and cPAcP siRNA transfection of LNCaP C-33 cells each increases ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, correlating with increased AI PSA secretion and cell proliferation. Conversely, trapping ErbB-2 by transfected endoplasmic reticulum-targeting ScFv5R expression vector abolished DHT-induced LNCaP C-33 cell growth. Moreover, inhibition of ErbB-2 but not EGFR in AI LNCaP C-81 and MDA PCa2b-AI PCa cells significantly abolished AI cell growth.

The proposed system was achieved by modification of glassy carbon electrode with graphene oxide/chitosan film and covalently attached of monoclonal PSA antibody and thionine as redox probe onto the modified electrode surface. Then, immunosensing was completed using sandwich-type immunoreaction of the PSA-antigen between anti-PSA immobilized on the graphene/chitosan interface and PSA-aptamer. For improve the sensitivity, polyamidoamine dendrimer-encapsulated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-PAMAM) was used for covalent attachment of PSA-aptamer and HRP linked aptamer (Au-PAMA/aptamer-HRP) as electrochemical label in the sandwich format and electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2 in the presence of enzymatically oxidized thionine was measured. Under optimized condition, the obtained detection limit and linear concentration range were 10 fg ml(-1)(S/N=3) and 0.1 pg ml(-1) to 90 ngml(-1) respectively, using differential pulse voltammetry as measuring technique. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used as simple, rapid, low cost label free analytical technique for PSA measurement with detection limit of 5 pg ml(-1) at concentration range up to 35 ng ml(-1). Finally, the immunosensor is used to PSA detection in human serum and prostate tissue samples and the obtained result is well agreed with the values obtained by the standard ELISA method.

However, the application of these drugs is limited because of occurrence of inherent or acquired therapy resistances during the treatment. Thus, identification of new molecular targets is urgently required to improve current therapeutic prostate cancer (PCa) treatment strategies. PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1)) is known to be an important cell cycle regulator and PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation is essential for DNA repair. In this context, elevated PIAS1 expression has already been associated with cancer initiation. Thus, in the present study, we addressed the question of whether PIAS1 targeting can be used as a basis for an improved PCa therapy in combination with anti-androgens. We show that PIAS1 significantly correlates with AR expression in PCa tissue and in cell lines and demonstrate that high PIAS1 levels predict shorter relapse-free survival. Our patient data are complemented by mechanistic and functional in vitro experiments that identify PIAS1 as an androgen-responsive gene and a crucial factor for AR signaling via prevention of AR degradation. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown is sufficient to decrease cell proliferation as well as cell viability. Strikingly, Abiraterone or Enzalutamide treatment in combination with PIAS1 depletion is even more effective than single-drug treatment in multiple PCa cell models, rendering PIAS1 as a promising target protein for a combined treatment approach to improve future PCa therapies.""","""['M Puhr', 'J Hoefer', 'A Eigentler', 'D Dietrich', 'G van Leenders', 'B Uhl', 'M Hoogland', 'F Handle', 'B Schlick', 'H Neuwirt', 'V Sailer', 'G Kristiansen', 'H Klocker', 'Z Culig']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Critical role of androgen receptor level in prostate cancer cell resistance to new generation antiandrogen enzalutamide.', 'Unique targeting of androgen-dependent and -independent AR signaling in prostate cancer to overcome androgen resistance.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Androgen receptor-related micro RNAs in prostate cancer and their role in antiandrogen drug resistance.', 'New Compounds Targeting the Androgen Receptor for Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of CDKL3 downregulates STAT1 thus suppressing prostate cancer development.', ""Investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis using 'omics' approach."", 'Cancer-Associated Dysregulation of Sumo Regulators: Proteases and Ligases.', 'The Role of SUMO E3 Ligases in Signaling Pathway of Cancer Cells.', 'Sex disparities in DNA damage response pathways: Novel determinants in cancer formation and therapy.']"""

Pak1 is frequently overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in different human cancers, including human breast, ovary, prostate and brain cancer, due to amplification of the PAK1 gene in an 11q13 amplicon. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of Pak1 has been shown to reduce proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro and reduce tumor progression in vivo. In this work, we examined the roles of Pak1 in cellular and animal models of PAK1-amplified ovarian cancer. We found that inhibition of Pak1 leads to decreased proliferation and migration in PAK1-amplified/overexpressed ovarian cancer cells, and has no effect in cell that lack such amplification/overexpression. Further, we observed that loss of Pak1 function causes 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer cells to arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This arrest correlates with activation of p53 and p21(Cip) and decreased expression of cyclin B1.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 440 consecutive treatment-naïve patients initially diagnosed with mPCa between August 2000 and June 2012. Patient age, body mass index (BMI), Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA nadir, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, Visual Analogue Scale pain score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG PS), PSA response to hormone therapy, and metastatic sites were assessed. Cox-proportional hazards regression analyses were used to evaluate survivals and predictive variables of men with bone metastasis stratified according to the presence of pain, compared to men with visceral metastasis.  Results:   Metastases were most often found in bone (75.4%), followed by lung (16.3%) and liver (8.3%) tissues. Bone metastasis, pain, and high BMI were associated with increased risks of progression to CRPC, and bone metastasis, pain, PSA nadir, and ECOG PS≥1 were significant predictors of CSM. During the median follow-up of 32.0 (interquartile range 14.7-55.9) months, patients with bone metastasis with pain and patients with both bone and visceral metastases showed the worst median progression to CRPC-free and cancer-specific survivals, followed by men with bone metastasis without pain. Patients with visceral metastasis had the best median survivals.  Conclusion:   Metastatic spread and pain patterns confer different prognosis in patients with mPCa.

Although a majority of patients initially respond to androgen-deprivation therapy, most will eventually develop castration resistance. An increased understanding of the mechanisms that underline the pathogenesis of castration resistance is therefore needed to develop novel therapeutics. LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines are models for androgen-dependence and androgen-independence, respectively. Herein, we report the comparative analysis of these two prostate cancer cell lines using integrated global proteomics and glycoproteomics. Global proteome profiling of the cell lines using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling and two- dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) led to the quantification of 8063 proteins. To analyze the glycoproteins, glycosite-containing peptides were isolated from the same iTRAQ-labeled peptides from the cell lines using solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Among the 1810 unique N-linked glycosite-containing peptides from 653 identified N-glycoproteins, 176 glycoproteins were observed to be different between the two cell lines. A majority of the altered glycoproteins were also observed with changes in their global protein expression levels. However, alterations in 21 differentially expressed glycoproteins showed no change at the protein abundance level, indicating that the glycosylation site occupancy was different between the two cell lines. To determine the glycosylation heterogeneity at specific glycosylation sites, we further identified and quantified 1145 N-linked glycopeptides with attached glycans in the same iTRAQ-labeled samples. These intact glycopeptides contained 67 glycan compositions and showed increased fucosylation in PC3 cells in several of the examined glycosylation sites. The increase in fucosylation could be caused by the detected changes in enzymes belonging to the glycan biosynthesis pathways of protein fucosylation observed in our proteomic analysis. The altered protein fucosylation forms have great potential in aiding our understanding of castration resistance and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches and specific detection strategies for prostate cancer.""","""['Punit Shah', 'Xiangchun Wang', 'Weiming Yang', 'Shadi Toghi Eshghi', 'Shisheng Sun', 'Naseruddin Hoti', 'Lijun Chen', 'Shuang Yang', 'Jered Pasay', 'Abby Rubin', 'Hui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic analyses of doxorubicin sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells reveal glycoprotein alteration in protein abundance and glycosylation.', 'An integrated proteomic and glycoproteomic approach uncovers differences in glycosylation occupancy from benign and malignant epithelial ovarian tumors.', 'GPQuest: A Spectral Library Matching Algorithm for Site-Specific Assignment of Tandem Mass Spectra to Intact N-glycopeptides.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Chemical and Enzymatic Methods for Global Analysis of Protein Glycosylation.', 'Glycoproteomic markers of hepatocellular carcinoma-mass spectrometry based approaches.', 'Integrated glycoproteomic characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Deciphering the Properties and Functions of Glycoproteins Using Quantitative Proteomics.', 'FUT2 promotes the tumorigenicity and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells via the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.', 'Differentially expressed glycoproteins in pre- and post-digital rectal examination urine samples for detecting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Site-Specific Intact N-Linked Glycopeptide Characterization of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen from Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, when neuroendocrine-differentiated, overexpress Cav3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels that contribute to Ca(2+)-dependent secretion. Given evidence for the acceleration of Cav3.2 activity by hydrogen sulfide (H2S), we examined the roles of the H2S/Cav3.2 pathway and then analyzed the molecular mechanisms of the Cav3.2 overexpression in neuroendocrine-differentiated LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were differentiated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Protein levels and T-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent currents (T-currents) were measured by immunoblotting and whole-cell pacth-clamp technique, respectively. Spontaneous release of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was monitored to evaluate secretory function. The differentiated LNCaP cells exhibited neurite outgrowth, androgen-independent proliferation and upregulation of mitogenic factors, and also showed elevation of Cav3.2 expression or T-currents. Expression of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), H2S-forming enzymes, and spontaneous secretion of PAP increased following the differentiation. The augmented T-currents were enhanced by H2S donors and suppressed by inhibitors of CSE, but not CBS. The PAP secretion was reduced by inhibition of CSE or T-type Ca(2+) channels. During differentiation, Egr-1 and REST, positive and negative transcriptional regulators for Cav3.2, were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, and Egr-1 knockdown prevented the Cav3.2 overexpression. Our data suggest that, in neuroendocrine-differentiated LNCaP cells, H2S formed by the upregulated CSE promotes the activity of the upregulated Cav3.2, leading to the elevated secretory functions.

The primary objective was to investigate isoflavone bioavailability and metabolite profile. Secondary objectives include safety, compliance, and assessment of biomarkers linked to prostate carcinogenesis. Two distinct SBs were formulated to deliver approximately 60 mg aglycone equivalents of isoflavones per day. The isoflavones were present as aglycones (∼78% as aglycones) in the SAB whereas in the standard SB predominantly as glucosides (18% total isoflavones as aglycones). Compliance to SB (97% ± 4%) and SAB (92% ± 18%) was excellent; toxicity was rare and limited to grade 1 gastrointestinal complaints. Pharmacokinetic studies between SB and SAB showed modest differences. Peak serum concentration time (Tmax) was significantly faster with SAB meal compared with SB in some isoflavonoids, and AUC0 to 24 h of dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin was significantly greater after an SB meal. An exploratory cluster analysis was used to identify four isoflavone-metabolizing phenotypes. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein increased significantly by 41% (P = 0.024) with soy intervention.

Although PTEN inactivation by mutation is infrequent in breast cancer, transcript and protein levels are deficient in >25 % of cases. The E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (also known as NEDD4-1) has been reported to negatively regulate PTEN protein levels through poly-ubiquitination and proteolysis in carcinomas of the prostate, lung, and bladder, but its effect on PTEN in the breast has not been studied extensively. To investigate whether NEDD4 contributes to low PTEN levels in human breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of these proteins by immunohistochemistry across a large Swedish cohort of breast tumor specimens, and their transcript expression levels by microarrays. For both NEDD4 and PTEN, their transcript expression was significantly correlated to their protein expression. However, comparing NEDD4 expression to PTEN expression, either no association or a positive correlation was observed at the protein and transcript levels. This unexpected observation was further corroborated in two independent breast cancer cohorts from The Netherlands Cancer Institute and The Cancer Genome Atlas.

We wonder whether it is time for these examinations to be dismissed, evaluating their staging accuracy in a large cohort of radical prostatectomy (RP) patients.  Methods:   To evaluate the ability of CT to predict lymph node involvement (LNI), we included 1091 patients treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection, previously staged with abdomino-pelvic CT. As for bone metastases, we included 1145 PCa patients deemed fit for surgery, previously staged with Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate planar BS.  Results:   CT scan showed a sensitivity and specificity in predicting LNI of 8.8 and 98 %; subgroup analysis disclosed a significant association only for the high-risk subgroup of 334 patients (P 0.009) with a sensitivity of 11.8 % and positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.4 %. However, logistic multivariate regression analysis including preoperative risk factors excluded any additional predictive ability of CT even in the high-risk group (P 0.40). These data are confirmed by ROC curve analysis, showing a low AUC of 54 % for CT, compared with 69 % for Partin tables and 80 % for Briganti nomogram. BS showed some positivity in 74 cases, only four of whom progressed, while 49 patients with negative BS progressed during their follow-up, six of them immediately after surgery.

These models have not been compared with respect to cancer-specific mortality (CSM) prediction.  Objective:   To validate and compare the prediction tools for 10-yr CSM.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 2485 prostate cancer patients underwent RP in a European tertiary care center.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Three preoperative models (D'Amico, CAPRA, and Stephenson) were compared in terms of their ability to predict 10-yr CSM; therefore, accuracy tests (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were assessed for each model.  Results and limitations:   CSM at 10 yr was 3.6%. The AUC was 0.76, 0.77, and 0.80 for the D'Amico, CAPRA, and Stephenson models, respectively. In calibration plots, predicted probabilities were close to the observed probabilities for the D'Amico model but showed underestimation of CSM for the Stephenson nomogram and overestimation of CSM for the CAPRA score. DCA identified a benefit for the CAPRA score. These results apply to patients treated at a European tertiary care center.  Conclusions:   Despite good discriminatory power, all tested models had some shortcomings in terms of prediction of 10-yr CSM. All three models showed good performance in North American cohorts, but our results suggested a lack of generalizability to European patients. To overcome this issue, local recalibration of the variable weights could be performed. Another possibility is the development of more universal markers that are independent of regional practice differences or, alternatively, the development of better tools to quantify clinical practice differences.  Patient summary:   Prediction tools can predict cancer survival prior surgery, relying on points for age, prostate-specific antigen levels, aggressiveness, and percentage of cancer at biopsy. These tools are reliable in North American patients but have shortcomings for identifying patients at high risk of prostate cancer death in Europe.""","""['Katharina Boehm', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Zhe Tian', 'Derya Tilki', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Markus Graefen', 'Lars Budäus']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Predicting Cancer-specific Mortality After Radical Prostatectomy: Still a Long Way To Go.', 'Multi-institutional validation of the CAPRA-S score to predict disease recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Prognostic prediction following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer using conventional as well as molecular biological approaches.', 'Nomogram Predicts Risk and Prognostic Factors for Bone Metastasis of Pancreatic Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Optimising preoperative risk stratification tools for prostate cancer using mpMRI.', 'Prediction of Pathological Stage in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Neuro-Fuzzy Model.', 'Contemporary Role of the Decipher® Test in Prostate Cancer Management: Current Practice and Future Perspectives.']"""

Therefore, we investigated the association between biomarkers of oxidative stress and ED in prospective setting among a relatively large sample size of men.  Methods:   We conducted the prospective study among 917 men ages between 47 and 80 years at the time of blood draw, which is a part of nested prospective case-control study of prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Plasma fluorescent oxidation products (FlOPs), a global biomarker for oxidative stress, were measured at three excitation/emission wavelengths (360/420 nm named as FlOP_360; 320/420 nm named as FlOP_320 and 400/475 nm named as FlOP_400).  Results:   Approximately 35% of men developed ED during follow-up.

Further analysis of the association between FlOPs and ED in the fasting samples or controls only (free of prostate cancer incidence) did not change the results appreciably.

Experimental design:   In the clinical trial, radiographic imaging and serum markers were examined, as well as molecular markers in tumors from bone biopsies. In mice harboring PDX intrafemurally or subcutaneously, cabozantinib effects on tumor growth, MET, PDX in which MET was silenced, VEGFR2, bone turnover, angiogenesis, and resistance were examined.  Results:   In responsive patients and PDX, islets of viable pMET-positive tumor cells persisted, which rapidly regrew after drug withdrawal. Knockdown of MET in PDX did not affect tumor growth in mice nor did it affect cabozantinib-induced growth inhibition but did lead to induction of FGFR1. Inhibition of VEGFR2 and MET in endothelial cells reduced the vasculature, leading to necrosis. However, each islet of viable cells surrounded a VEGFR2-negative vessel. Reduction of bone turnover was observed in both cohorts.  Conclusions:   Our studies demonstrate that MET in tumor cells is not a persistent therapeutic target for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but inhibition of VEGFR2 and MET in endothelial cells and direct effects on osteoblasts are responsible for cabozantinib-induced tumor inhibition. However, vascular heterogeneity represents one source of primary therapy resistance, whereas induction of FGFR1 in tumor cells suggests a potential mechanism of acquired resistance.

ABC294640 is a first-in-class SK2 small-molecule inhibitor that effectively inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Given that AR and Myc are two of the most widely implicated oncogenes in prostate cancer, and that sphingolipids affect signaling by both proteins, the therapeutic potential for using ABC294640 in the treatment of prostate cancer was evaluated. This study demonstrates that ABC294640 abrogates signaling pathways requisite for prostate cancer growth and proliferation. Key findings validate that ABC294640 treatment of early-stage and advanced prostate cancer models downregulate Myc and AR expression and activity. This corresponds with significant inhibition of growth, proliferation, and cell-cycle progression. Finally, oral administration of ABC294640 was found to dramatically impede xenograft tumor growth. Together, these pre-clinical findings support the hypotheses that SK2 activity is required for prostate cancer function and that ABC294640 represents a new pharmacological agent for treatment of early stage and aggressive prostate cancer.

In the present study, we investigated the association of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 levels and various markers of tumor aggressiveness and explore some potential mechanisms underlying the associations.  Methods:   We used human and murine prostate cancer cell lines and their respective hormone resistance sub-lines, in vitro and in vivo to examine the changes in tumor aggressiveness, as well as the pathway responsible for these changes. Furthermore, 105 prostate cancer biopsy specimens were analyzed to correlate the level of TGF-β1 with the clinical characteristics of patients.  Results:   Our data revealed that activated TGF-β1 signaling resulted in more aggressive tumor growth and augmented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Activated IL-6 signaling was associated with TGF-β1 levels and the aggressive tumor features noted in TGF-β1-positive prostate cancers in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the TGF-β1 levels significantly correlated with Tregs accumulation in vivo. The clinical data indicated that TGF-β1 immunoreactivity had a moderate positive correlation with IL-6 staining, advanced clinical stage, higher Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA in patients with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   TGF-β1 levels are significantly associated with aggressive prostate features.

Next, we developed chimeric AAV vectors with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide incorporated into the viral capsid to enable specific targeting of integrin-overexpressing malignant cells. These AAV6-RGD vectors improved transduction efficiency approximately 3-fold compared with wild-type AAV6 vectors by enhancing the viral entry into the cells. We also observed that transduction efficiency significantly improved, up to approximately 5-fold, by the mutagenesis of surface-exposed tyrosine and threonine residues involved in the intracellular trafficking of AAV vectors. Therefore, in our study, the AAV6-Y705-731F+T492V vector was identified as the most efficient. The combination of RGD peptide, tyrosine and threonine mutations on the same AAV6 capsid further increased the transduction efficiency, approximately 8-fold in vitro.

However, it remains unclear at which stage in the carcinogenic pathway fiber may act or which food sources of dietary fiber may be most beneficial against colorectal cancer development.  Objective:   The objective was to prospectively evaluate the association between dietary fiber intake and the risk of incident and recurrent colorectal adenoma and incident colorectal cancer.  Design:   Study participants were identified from the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Participants received flexible sigmoidoscopy at baseline and 3 or 5 y after. Dietary fiber intake was measured by using a self-reported dietary questionnaire. The colorectal cancer, incident adenoma, and recurrent adenoma analyses were based on 57,774, 16,980, and 1667 participants, respectively. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the risk of incident and recurrent adenoma, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of colorectal cancer across categories of dietary fiber intake, with adjustment for potential confounders.  Results:   Elevated total dietary fiber intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident distal colorectal adenoma (ORhighest vs. lowest tertile of intake: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.003) but not recurrent adenoma (P-trend = 0.67). Although the association was not statistically significant for colorectal cancer overall (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.03; P-trend = 0.10), a reduced risk of distal colon cancer was observed with increased total fiber intake (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.94; P-trend = 0.03). Protective associations were most notable for fiber originating from cereals or fruit.  Conclusions:   This large, prospective study within a population-based screening trial suggests that individuals consuming the highest intakes of dietary fiber have reduced risks of incident colorectal adenoma and distal colon cancer and that this effect of dietary fiber, particularly from cereals and fruit, may begin early in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors (VEGFRs) are potent mediators of angiogenesis and tumor proliferation, but have been examined to a limited extent in large prostate cancer studies. Meanwhile, recent promising results on VEGFR-2 inhibition have highlighted their importance, leading to the need for further investigations regarding their expression and prognostic impact.  Design:   Using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry, the expression of VEGFs (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and their receptors (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) were measured in neoplastic tissue and corresponding stroma from radical prostatectomy specimens in 535 Norwegian patients. Their expression was evaluated semiquantatively and associations with event-free survival were calculated.  Results:   High expression of VEGFR-2 in either stroma or epithelium was independently associated with a higher incidence of prostate cancer relapse (HR = 4.56, P = 0.038).

In patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), mp-MRI could provide information on the position of the cancer, allowing adjustments to be made to the needle depth and direction before repeat transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy to ensure accurate sampling of lesions. The purpose of the prospective study was to evaluate mp-MRI of the prostate in patients with PSA elevation before initial TRUS-guided biopsy.  Methods:   mp-MRI was performed in 94 patients using a 1.5-T scanner (MAGNETOM Aera(®); Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and 16-channel phased-array body coil (Siemens Healthcare). T2 weighted images (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and MR spectroscopy were obtained. TRUS-guided random biopsies and additional targeted biopsies of suspicious MRI areas were performed.  Results:   Additional targeted biopsies were obtained in 17 of 43 (40%) patients with PCA. 11 of 17 targeted biopsies contained PCA. 5 of 11 PCAs were diagnosed only by additional targeted biopsies. Sensitivity of mp-MRI in patients was 97.7% and specificity was 11.8%. mp-MRI was false negative in one patient. Sensitivity of mp-MRI in 207 lesions was 80.9% and specificity was 44.7%. In a logistic regression model, the apparent diffusion coefficient value was the only significant parameter to differentiate malignant and benign lesions.  Conclusion:   mp-MRI should be performed in patients with PSA elevation before initial TRUS-guided biopsy to allow additional targeted biopsies from suspicious areas of MRI. We recommend mp-MRI with T2WI, DWI, DCE MRI and MR spectroscopy. DWI as the most reliable technique should be used in every mp-MRI.

Nutrients such as glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies and amino acids may be utilized as preferred substrates to fulfill increased energy requirements. In this study we investigated the metabolic characteristics of benign and cancer cells of the prostate with respect to their utilization of medium chain (MCTs) and long chain triglycerides (LCTs) under standard and glucose-starved culture conditions by assessing cell viability, glycolytic activity, mitochondrial respiration, the expression of genes encoding key metabolic enzymes as well as mitochondrial mass and mtDNA content. We report that BE prostate cells (RWPE-1) have a higher competence to utilize fatty acids as energy source than PCa cells (LNCaP, ABL, PC3) as shown not only by increased cell viability upon fatty acid supplementation but also by an increased ß-oxidation of fatty acids, although the base-line respiration was 2-fold higher in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, BE RWPE-1 cells were found to compensate for glucose starvation in the presence of fatty acids. Of notice, these findings were confirmed in vivo by showing that PCa tissue has a lower capacity in oxidizing fatty acids than benign prostate. Collectively, these metabolic differences between benign and prostate cancer cells and especially their differential utilization of fatty acids could be exploited to establish novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.""","""['Andrea Dueregger', 'Bernd Schöpf', 'Theresa Eder', 'Julia Höfer', 'Erich Gnaiger', 'Astrid Aufinger', 'Lukas Kenner', 'Bernhard Perktold', 'Reinhold Ramoner', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Iris E Eder']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tumor necrosis factor alpha increases aerobic glycolysis and reduces oxidative metabolism in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Mitochondria: The ketogenic diet--A metabolism-based therapy.', 'Hypoxia and the metabolic phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting prostate cancer cell metabolism: impact of hexokinase and CPT-1 enzymes.', 'Fatty acid oxidation is a dominant bioenergetic pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Lipid Alterations in Glioma: A Systematic Review.', 'Enhanced Succinate Oxidation with Mitochondrial Complex II Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Fatty acid oxidation enzyme Δ3, Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase 1 (ECI1) drives aggressive tumor phenotype and predicts poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'Serum Levels of the Cytokine TWEAK Are Associated with Metabolic Status in Patients with Prostate Cancer and Modulate Cancer Cell Lipid Metabolism In Vitro.', 'The inhibitory effect of melatonin on human prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Analysis was performed on data derived from transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy registry containing 2461 men who underwent biopsy between March 2005 and January 2015. Eligible patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of chronic inflammation in prostate. Group 1 consisted of 920 patients with histopathologic evidence of chronic inflammation and group 2 consisted of 1287 patients with no evidence of inflammation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of PSA, PSA density (PSAD), and TZPSAD for detecting prostate cancer (PCa) in each group. Patients who underwent rebiopsy during the study period were further assessed to determine factors that may predict the presence of PCa on subsequent biopsies.  Results:   In group 1 patients, at 90% sensitivity for detecting PCa, PSAD and TZPSAD showed 19.7% and 37.8% specificity at cutoff values of 0.10 and 0.27 ng/mL/mL respectively, whereas in group 2 patients, PSAD and TZPSAD revealed 29.8% and 31.4% specificity, respectively. Chronic inflammation at initial biopsy was associated with a significant decrease in the likelihood of cancer detection during rebiopsy (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.99). TZPSAD was found to be capable of sparing 39.8% of unnecessary rebiopsies in group 1 patients, whereas it spared 20.5% of unnecessary rebiopsies in group 2 patients.

Methods:   All the 16 patients who had a pTURP between November 2007 and January 2015 due to BOO (high residual urine volume combined with hydronephrosis or urinary retention refractory to medical treatment) at our institution were retrospectively assessed. All the patients were diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer (III stage or IV stage). The clinical data, functional and oncological follow-up results were evaluated. The cancer specific survivals were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 73.8 years (63-81 years). Five cases were graded in stage III of prostate cancer and 11 in stage IV. The indications for pTURP were refractory urinary retention in 12 cases, and high residual urine volume with hydronephrosis in 4 cases. The mean prostate volume at pTURP was 43.2 mL (28-78 mL) and the mean PSA (prostate specific antigen) level before pTURP was 48.2 μg/L (2-107 μg/L). The patients had mean residual urine volume 166.4 mL (50-450 mL) and mean urinary flow rate 3.6 mL/s (0-6 mL/s, n=7) before pTURP. It took mean 62.9 min (35-94 min) in pTURP with mean estimated blood loss 126.9 mL (30-263 mL) and mean resected tissue 14.1 g (10-22 g). There were no transfusion cases. Postoperative mean serum PSA 20.5 μg/L (1-41 μg/L), residual urine volume 43.4 mL (0-400 mL) and urinary flow rate 10.1 mL/s (7-16 mL/s, n=7) were shown in these cases. A patient encountered persistent hematuria needing irrigation. Compared with preoperation, the patients had significantly lower serum PSA level (P<0.001), less residual urine volume (P<0.001) and more urinary flow rate (P=0.001) after pTURP. The mean follow-up after pTURP was 36 months (1-86 months). In addition, 2 patients received repeated pTURP. At the time of the latest analysis, 3 patients died from prostate cancer progression. As estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 2-, 3- and 5-year cancer specific survival rates after pTURP were 91%, 78% and 58%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Despite less resected tissue, greater delay in urination and reoperation rates, pTURP is a fairly effective procedure in patients with server BOO. Although a potential negative impact of pTURP on survival cannot be excluded, the estimated 3- and 5-year cancer specific survival rates in this series seem to justify this intervention.""","""['Lei Liu', 'Xiao-fei Hou', 'Lu-lin Ma', 'Lei Zhao', 'Hong-xian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Palliative transurethral resection of the prostate: functional outcome and impact on survival.', 'Palliative Transurethral Resection of the Prostate in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study of 188 Patients.', 'Diode laser ablation of prostate and channel transurethral resection of prostate in patients with prostate cancer and bladder outlet obstruction symptoms.', 'Simultaneous transurethral cystolithotripsy with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: a prospective feasibility study and review of literature.', 'Management of complications after surgical outlet reduction for benign prostatic obstruction.']"""

As [(11) C]acetate exhibits a close correlation with the level of fatty acid synthase, we aimed to assess whether the SUV in [(11) C]acetate PET serves as a suitable prognostic marker in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   In 123 consecutive patients, examined between 2010 and 2014, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of local recurrences as well as lymph node and bone metastases was measured. Choosing the spleen as a standard for relatively high physiological uptake, a ratio of tumor to spleen uptake (SUVts) was calculated for standardizing the uptake, too. The corresponding initial Gleason scores (GS) and serum-PSA levels around the time of the performed PET/CT for each patient were retrospectively collected and PSA doubling together with PSA velocity were determined. For further analysis patients were divided with regard to their initial Gleason score (≤3 + 4 and ≥ 4 + 3). The median of PSA velocity was calculated to separate patients with a high and low PSA velocity and Mann-Whitney U or Student's t-test were used, testing for significant differences. For correlation Spearmen-Rho test was used.  Results:   PET was positive for recurrence in 82/123 patients. PSA was significantly higher in PET-positive than in negative patients (5.9 vs. 3.2 ng/ml; P = 0.006). Initial Gleason score did not differ in PET negative and positive patients (P = 0.3), whereas PSA velocity was markedly higher in PET positive patients (0.4 vs. 0.1 ng/ml/month; P = 0.01). Median SUVmax of PET positive patients was 5.23 (mean 5.78; range 0.9-16.8) and meadian SUVts was 0.78 (mean 0.84, range 0.14-2.50). SUVts was significantly higher in patients with high PSA velocity (SUVts 0.76 vs. 0.92; P = 0.009), whereas SUVmax failed statistical significance (5.4 vs. 6.3 ng/ml/month; P = 0.08). Patients with a high SUVmax proved to have a significantly higher median Gleason score compared to low uptake 8.0 vs. 7.0; P = 0.004). Vice versa both SUVmax (GS 6: 5.0; GS 7: 5.6; GS 8: 5.7; GS 9: 6.5; r = 0.30, P = 0.008) and SUVts (GS 6: 0.63; GS 7: 0.68; GS 8: 0.85; GS 9: 0.89; r = 0.30, P = 0.006) significantly correlated with Gleason score.

Here, we report the identification of 145 previously unannotated intergenic long noncoding RNA transcripts (lncRNA) or isoforms that are associated with prostate cancer or CRPC. Of the one third of these transcripts that were specific for CRPC, we defined a novel lncRNA termed PCAT5 as a regulatory target for the transcription factor ERG, which is activated in approximately 50% of human prostate cancer. Genome-wide expression analysis of a PCAT5-positive prostate cancer after PCAT5 silencing highlighted alterations in cell proliferation pathways. Strikingly, an in vitro validation of these alterations revealed a complex integrated phenotype affecting cell growth, migration, invasion, colony-forming potential, and apoptosis.

These patients, irradiated for painful bone metastases, rated pain, QoL, and overall health at baseline and weekly afterward for 12 weeks. Using generalized estimating equations analysis, the course of QoL was studied, adjusted for primary tumor. To identify predictive variables, proportional hazard analyses were performed, taking into account death as a competing risk, and C-statistics were calculated for discriminative value.  Results:   In total, 722 patients (76%) responded to radiation therapy. During follow-up, responders had a better QoL in all domains compared with nonresponders. Patients with breast or prostate cancer had a better QoL than patients with lung cancer. In multivariate analysis, baseline predictors for a pain response were breast or prostate cancer as primary tumor, younger age, good performance status, absence of visceral metastases, and using opioids. The discriminative ability of the model was low (C-statistic: 0.56).  Conclusions:   Responding patients show a better QoL after radiation therapy for painful bone metastases than nonresponders.

Detection of radiation-induced biochemical changes can reveal unique metabolic pathways affecting radiosensitivity that may serve as attractive therapeutic targets. Using clinically relevant doses of radiation, we performed label-free single cell Raman spectroscopy on a series of human cancer cell lines and detected radiation-induced accumulation of intracellular glycogen. The increase in glycogen post-irradiation was highest in lung (H460) and breast (MCF7) tumor cells compared to prostate (LNCaP) tumor cells. In response to radiation, the appearance of this glycogen signature correlated with radiation resistance. Moreover, the buildup of glycogen was linked to the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, a canonical modulator of cell survival following radiation exposure and a key regulator of glycogen metabolism. When MCF7 cells were irradiated in the presence of the anti-diabetic drug metformin, there was a significant decrease in the amount of radiation-induced glycogen. The suppression of glycogen by metformin following radiation was associated with increased radiosensitivity. In contrast to MCF7 cells, metformin had minimal effects on both the level of glycogen in H460 cells following radiation and radiosensitivity. Our data demonstrate a novel approach of spectral monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to assess changes in the levels of intracellular glycogen as a potential marker and resistance mechanism to radiation therapy.""","""['Quinn Matthews', 'Martin Isabelle', 'Samantha J Harder', 'Julian Smazynski', 'Wayne Beckham', 'Alexandre G Brolo', 'Andrew Jirasek', 'Julian J Lum']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Biochemical signatures of in vitro radiation response in human lung, breast and prostate tumour cells observed with Raman spectroscopy.', 'A Raman spectroscopic study of cell response to clinical doses of ionizing radiation.', 'Raman spectroscopy and group and basis-restricted non negative matrix factorisation identifies radiation induced metabolic changes in human cancer cells.', 'Raman spectroscopy identifies radiation response in human non-small cell lung cancer xenografts.', 'Optical Imaging Approaches to Investigating Radiation Resistance.', 'Glycogen synthase 1 targeting reveals a metabolic vulnerability in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Understanding radiation response and cell cycle variation in brain tumour cells using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Raman spectroscopy and convolutional neural networks for monitoring biochemical radiation response in breast tumour xenografts.', 'Raman microspectroscopy and machine learning for use in identifying radiation-induced lung toxicity.', 'Group and Basis Restricted Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Random Forest for Molecular Histotype Classification and Raman Biomarker Monitoring in Breast Cancer.']"""

A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the 5-year BCRFS, and Cox regression models were used to evaluate the effect of the surgical approach on biochemical recurrence.  Results:   A total of 356 high-risk PCa patients (106 [29.8%] RRP and 250 [70.2%] RARP) were included in the final cohort analyzed. Before adjustment, the mean percentage of positive cores on biopsy and pathologic stage were poorer for RRP versus RARP (p=0.036 vs. p=0.054, respectively). The unadjusted 5-year BCRFS rates were better for RARP than for RRP (RRP vs. RARP: 48.1% vs. 64.4%, p=0.021). After adjustment for preoperative variables, the 5-year BCRFS rates were similar between RRP and RARP patients (48.5% vs. 59.6%, p=0.131).

The signaling adaptor p62 contributes to mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and interacts with TRAF6, which is required for the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome and the subsequent K63 polyubiquitination and activation of mTOR. However, the signal initiating these p62-driven processes was previously unknown. Here, we show that p62 is phosphorylated via a cascade that includes MEK3/6 and p38δ and is driven by the PB1-containing kinase MEKK3. This phosphorylation results in the recruitment of TRAF6 to p62, the ubiquitination and activation of mTOR, and the regulation of autophagy and cell proliferation. Genetic inactivation of MEKK3 or p38δ mimics that of p62 in that it leads to inhibited growth of PTEN-deficient prostate organoids.

Here, we found that JMJD1A knockdown in prostate cancer cells antagonizes their proliferation and survival. Profiling array analyses revealed that JMJD1A-dependent genes function in cellular growth, proliferation and survival, and implicated that the c-Myc transcriptional network is deregulated following JMJD1A inhibition. Biochemical analyses confirmed that JMJD1A enhances c-Myc transcriptional activity by upregulating c-Myc expression levels. Mechanistically, JMJD1A activity promoted recruitment of androgen receptor (AR) to the c-Myc gene enhancer and induced H3K9 demethylation, increasing AR-dependent transcription of c-Myc mRNA. In parallel, we found that JMJD1A regulated c-Myc stability, likely by inhibiting HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to target degradation of several substrates including c-Myc. JMJD1A (wild type or mutant lacking histone demethylase activity) bound to HUWE1, attenuated HUWE1-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of c-Myc, increasing c-Myc protein levels. Furthermore, c-Myc knockdown in prostate cancer cells phenocopied effects of JMJD1A knockdown, and c-Myc re-expression in JMJD1A-knockdown cells partially rescued prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. c-Myc protein levels were positively correlated with those of JMJD1A in a subset of human prostate cancer specimens.

Material and methods:   Our initial hypofractionation regimen was 66 Gy given in 22 fractions, prescribed to the isocenter, delivered with 3D-conformal radiotherapy plan. The clinical target volume was the prostate gland and the planning target volume consisted of the clinical target volume plus a 7-mm margin in all directions. Hormonal therapy was not given to any patient.  Results:   The long-term results for this group of patients confirmed the feasibility, good tolerance and excellent disease control of the regimen with the extra-benefit of being convenient to both patients and the health system by shortening treatment duration. The outcomes of this approach stimulated us to use hypofractionation in patients with intermediate-risk. Analysis of 100 intermediate-risk patients receiving our hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen (no hormones) shows, at median follow-up of 75 months, 8-year biochemical recurrence free and cancer specific survival rates of 90% and 95%, respectively, with acceptable toxicity.  Discussion:   Our technique changed from 3D to intensity modulated radiotherapy with the dose adjusted to 60 Gy in 20 fractions. Lastly, we have expanded the program to high-risk patients where IMRT treatments are given to the pelvic nodes (44 Gy in 20 fractions) with a simultaneous integrated boost delivery to the prostate (60 Gy in the same 20 fractions). Our long-term results have shown that moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer is safe and provides good tumor control comparable to high-dose conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.

New treatments (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide cabazitaxel, radium-223, sipuleucel-T) have improved patient outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our objective was to analyse whether body composition parameters exert a prognostic role in mCRPC patients treated with next generation of androgen receptor (AR) axis inhibitors (abiraterone and enzalutamide).  Methods:   All mCRPC patients from our institution who were enrolled in two prospective trials, assessing the efficacy of abiraterone acetate and the efficacy of enzalutamide, were selected. SMM, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) indexes were assessed with computed tomography imaging by measuring cross-sectional areas of the tissues.  Results:   In the 120 patients with available data, median OS and PFS were respectively: 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12-19) and 4 months (95% [CI] = 3-6). OS was associated with the SAT index: median survival was 15 months (95% [CI] 9-18) for patients with a SAT index < median value and 18 months (95% [CI] 13-30) for patients with a SAT index above (P = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, only the occurrence of visceral metastasis (P = 0.004), pain (P = 0.015) and SAT index (P = 0.036) were statistically significant predictors of OS.

In this study, we investigated the influence of prior ART on the efficacy of cabazitaxel in men with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   Data from an ongoing multicentre, phase II trial were used comprising 114 men with mCRPC treated with cabazitaxel in the post-docetaxel setting. The primary endpoints of the current analysis were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (⩾ 50%), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of prior ART on the efficacy of cabazitaxel.  Results:   From the 114 patients included in this analysis, 44 men received prior ART and 70 men did not receive prior ART before treatment with cabazitaxel.

Our previous study showed that ASCT2 (Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporter (AAT)) mediates fluciclovine uptake in androgen-dependent PCa cells; its expression is influenced by androgen, a key hormone in the progression of primary PCa and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we investigated the uptake mechanisms and feasibility of [(18)F]fluciclovine for CRPC in the androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP and LNCaP-derivatives LNCaP-SF and LN-REC4.  Methods:   LNCaP-SF was established after long-term cultivation of LNCaP in steroid-free conditions, and LN-Pre and LN-REC4 were established from LNCaP inoculated in intact and castrated severe combined immunodeficient mice, respectively. Uptake and competitive inhibition experiments were performed with trans-1-amino-3-fluoro[1-(14)C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid ([(14)C]fluciclovine) to characterize the involvement of AATs in androgen-dependent PCa (LNCaP and LN-Pre) and CRPC-like (LNCaP-SF and LN-REC4) cell lines. AAT expression was analyzed by Western blotting, and [(14)C]fluciclovine uptake in androgen-dependent PCa and CRPC-like cell lines were investigated in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  Results:   The contribution of Na(+)-dependent AATs to [(14)C]fluciclovine uptake in all cell lines was 88-98%, and [(14)C]fluciclovine uptake was strongly inhibited by L-glutamine and L-serine, the substrates for Na(+)-dependent alanine-serine-cysteine (system ASC) AATs, in the presence of Na(+). DHT enhanced ASCT2 expression in LNCaP, LN-Pre, and LN-REC4, but not in LNCaP-SF, and the responses of ASCT2 expression to DHT correlated with [(14)C]fluciclovine uptake.  Conclusions:   System ASC, especially ASCT2, could play a major role in [(14)C]fluciclovine uptake into CRPC-like and androgen-dependent PCa cells, suggesting [(18)F]fluciclovine-PET is applicable to the detection of CRPC as well as androgen-dependent PCa.

Associations among waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio, body mass index (BMI), and PCa risk were assessed in a population-based case-control study.  Patients and methods:   The study included 1933 incident PCa cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2009. Population controls were 1994 age-matched (±5y) Montreal residents selected from electoral lists. Information on sociodemographics, medical history including PCa screening, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences was collected through interviews. Logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios (ORs) for the association between anthropometric measures, and overall and grade-specific PCa.  Results:   After adjustment for BMI, an excess risk of high-grade PCa (Gleason≥7) was associated with a WC ≥102cm (OR = 1.47 [1.22-1.78]) and with a waist-hip ratio >1.0 (OR = 1.20 [1.01-1.43]). Men with a BMI≥30kg/m(2) had a lower risk of PCa, regardless of grade. Restricting to subjects recently screened for PCa did not alter findings.  Conclusion:   Elevated BMI was associated with a lower risk of PCa, regardless of grade. Contrastingly, abdominal obesity, when adjusted for BMI, yielded results in the opposite direction. Taken together, our observations suggest that the specific body fat distribution (abdominal), for a given BMI, is a predictor of PCa risk, whereas BMI alone is not. BMI and abdominal obesity, especially when measured by the WC, should be examined conjointly in future studies on this issue and may require consideration at patient counseling.""","""['Katharina Boehm', 'Maxine Sun', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Audrey Blanc-Lapierre', 'Jonas Schiffmann', 'Markus Graefen', 'José Sosa', 'Fred Saad', 'Marie-Élise Parent', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['General and abdominal obesity trajectories across adulthood, and risk of prostate cancer: results from the PROtEuS study, Montreal, Canada.', 'Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study.', 'Body size and prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study in China.', 'Abdominal obesity and gastroesophageal cancer risk: systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.', 'Body mass index, abdominal fatness and the risk of gallbladder disease.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'Nutritional index for immune-checkpoint inhibitor in patients with metastatic gastro-esophageal junction/gastric cancer.', 'Body shape and risk of glaucoma: A Mendelian randomization.', 'Metabolic Syndrome and Physical Inactivity May Be Shared Etiological Agents of Prostate Cancer and Coronary Heart Diseases.', 'Association between diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancer: review of recent literature.']"""

Among all miRNAs, miR203 has been recently shown to have an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer. However, its involvement in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer has not been reported.  Methods:   We examined the levels of miR203 in the breast cancer from the patients compared to the paired normal breast tissue. We also examined the levels of miR203 in several commonly used breast cancer cell lines. The effects of overexpression or depletion of miR203 on breast cancer cell growth were analyzed by a MTT assay, and on breast cancer cell invasion were examined by a scratch wound healing assay and a transwell cell migration assay. MiR203-targeted genes were analyzed by Western blot.  Results:   We detected significantly lower levels of miR203 in the breast cancer from the patients compared to the paired normal breast tissue. Moreover, the levels of miR203 were significantly lower in breast cancer tissue from the patients with cancer metastasis. Decreased miR203 levels were detected in all examined breast cancer lines. Overexpression of miR203 inhibited breast cancer cell growth and invasion, while antisense-mediated inhibition of miR203 enhanced cancer cell growth and invasion. Further analyses show that miR203 may inhibit cell growth through decreasing cell-cycle activator cyclinD2 and CDK6, increasing cell-cycle suppressor p21 and p27, and increasing apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2. MiR203 may also inhibit cell metastasis through suppressing matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP7 and MMP9.

The net inflammatory response is determined by a delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which, in turn, is determined by the genetic make-up. The present study investigates the role of variations in the promoter regions of IL-18 and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) cytokines on mRNA expressions and survival in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.  Methods:   The study was conducted on 584 volunteer males (291 patients of PCa, between 40-80 years of age. Genetic variants were studied by using RFLP and confirmed by probe based method. Expressions of mRNA were evaluated by real-time PCR (Roche light cycler 480). Relative mRNA and fold change gene expressions were analyzed by ([1/2] (ΔCt) ) and (2(-ΔΔCt) ) methods, respectively, and 5 year follow-ups were evaluated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with Log-rank test for trends.  Results:   IL-18 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in GG genotypes (at -137) of PCa with relative mRNA expression of 13.95, that is, 8.48 folds higher (P < 0.05) than controls; and showed a significant median survival of 1243 days.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 837 patients who underwent RARP for clinically localized prostate cancer without neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The pT2+category lesions were defined according to World Health Organization classification. The actuarial probabilities of biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR-FS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were also used to identify independent predictors for BCR.  Results:   Of the 837 patients, 102 (12.2%) experienced BCR during the follow-up period. The BCR-FS rate was significantly higher in patients with pT2+category tumors than in those with pT3a category tumors, and significantly lower in patients with pT2+category tumors than that in those with pT2 category tumors without PSM. The BCR-FS rate of patients with pT2+category tumors was significantly higher than that with pT3a category tumors with PSM but not significantly different from that with pT3a category tumors without PSM. In a multivariate analysis, the pathological T category considering pT2+category was one of independent predictive factors for BCR.  Conclusions:   This study support the hypothesis that the pT2+category disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of BCR in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer after RARP.

Objective:   To analyze if the differing surgical techniques of nerve-sparing (NS) versus non-nerve-sparing (NNS) RP and not the preservation of the NVB itself may be responsible for differences in continence rates.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 18 427 men who underwent RP from 2002 to 2014 in a single high-volume center were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with bilateral NS RP, with primary NNS RP, and with bilateral secondary resection of the NVBs for positive frozen-section results after an initial bilateral nerve sparing (secNNS) RP were studied.  Intervention:   NS, NNS, or secNNS RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable and propensity score matched analyses adjusting for age, prostate volume, and year of surgery were performed to assess differences in continence rates after RP. Continence was defined as the use of no or one safety pad per day.  Results and limitations:   Post-RP urinary continence rates at 1 wk, 3 mo, and 12 mo were 59.8%, 76.2%, 85.4% in the NS group, 39.5%, 59.5%, and 87.0% in the secNNS group, and 29.1%, 52.8%, and 70.5% in the NNS group. Continence rates at 12 mo after surgery did not differ significantly between patients who had bilateral NS and patients who had resection of both NVBs after an initial nerve-sparing technique (secNNS). In contrast, when comparing the NNS study groups with initial NNS versus secNNS, the latter group had significantly higher continence rates after 12 mo.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that the meticulous apical dissection associated with the NS RP technique rather than the preservation of the NVBs itself may have a positive impact on long-term urinary continence rates.

Copy number variations (CNV) were found across all chromosomes of the human genome. An average of 152 CNV fragments per genome was identified in the leukocytes from prostate cancer patients. The size distributions of CNV in the genome of leukocytes were highly correlative with prostate cancer aggressiveness. A prostate cancer outcome prediction model was developed based on large size ratio of CNV from the leukocyte genomes. This prediction model generated an average prediction rate of 75.2%, with sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 69.0% for prostate cancer recurrence. When combined with Nomogram and the status of fusion transcripts, the average prediction rate was improved to 82.5% with sensitivity of 84.8% and specificity of 78.2%. In addition, the leukocyte prediction model was 62.6% accurate in predicting short prostate specific antigen doubling time. When combined with Gleason's grade, Nomogram and the status of fusion transcripts, the prediction model generated a correct prediction rate of 77.5% with 73.7% sensitivity and 80.1% specificity.

To find inhibitors of AKT1 signaling with principally novel mechanism of action, we carried out a live cell-based screen for small molecule inhibitors of physical interaction between AKT1 and its primary activator PDPK1. The screen revealed one molecule-NSC156529, which downregulated AKT1 signaling, efficiently decreased the proliferation of human cancer cells in vitro, and substantially inhibited the growth of prostate tumor xenografts in vivo.

More recently, a PSMA ligand was developed that can be labeled with (68)Ga, (111)In, (177)Lu, and (90)Y. This ligand, named PSMA-617, therefore enables both diagnosis and therapy of PCa. The aims of this evaluation were to clinically investigate the distribution of (68)Ga-PSMA-617 in normal tissues and in PCa lesions as well as to evaluate the radiation exposure by the radioligand in PET imaging.  Methods:   Nineteen patients, most of them with recurrent PCa, were referred for (68)Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT. The quantitative assessment of tracer uptake of several organs and of 53 representative tumor lesions was performed in 15 patients at 1 and 3 h after injection. In 4 additional patients, the same procedure was conducted at 5 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h after injection. On the basis of the data for these 4 patients (mean injected dose, 231 MBq), the radiation exposure of a (68)Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT was identified.  Results:   Intense tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys and salivary glands. In 14 of 19 patients (73.7%), at least 1 lesion suspected of being a tumor was detected at 3 h after injection. Of 53 representative tumor lesions selected at 3 h after injection, 47 lesions were visible at 1 h after injection. The mean tumor-to-background ratio for maximum standardized uptake value was 20.4 ± 17.3 (range, 2.3-84.0) at 1 h after injection and 38.2 ± 38.6 (range, 3.6-154.3) at 3 h after injection. The average radiation exposure (effective dose) was approximately 0.021 mSv/MBq.  Conclusion:   Within healthy organs, the kidneys and salivary glands showed the highest (68)Ga-PSMA-617 uptake. The radiation exposure was relatively low. (68)Ga-PSMA-617 shows PCa lesions with high contrast.

Prostate cancers are thought to be hardwired to androgen receptor (AR) signaling, but AR-regulated changes in the prostate that facilitate metastasis remain poorly understood. We previously noted a marked reduction in secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1) expression during invasive phases of androgen-induced prostate growth, suggesting that this may be a novel invasive program governed by AR. Herein, we show that SPARCL1 loss occurs concurrently with AR amplification or overexpression in patient-based data. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SPARCL1 expression is directly suppressed by androgen-induced AR activation and binding at the SPARCL1 locus via an epigenetic mechanism, and these events can be pharmacologically attenuated with either AR antagonists or HDAC inhibitors. We establish using the Hi-Myc model of prostate cancer that in Hi-Myc/Sparcl1(-/-) mice, SPARCL1 functions to suppress cancer formation. Moreover, metastatic progression of Myc-CaP orthotopic allografts is restricted by SPARCL1 in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we show that SPARCL1 both tethers to collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and binds to the cell's cytoskeleton. SPARCL1 directly inhibits the assembly of focal adhesions, thereby constraining the transmission of cell traction forces. Our findings establish a new insight into AR-regulated prostate epithelial movement and provide a novel framework whereby SPARCL1 in the ECM microenvironment restricts tumor progression by regulating the initiation of the network of physical forces that may be required for metastatic invasion of prostate cancer.""","""['Paula J Hurley', 'Robert M Hughes', 'Brian W Simons', 'Jessie Huang', 'Rebecca M Miller', 'Brian Shinder', 'Michael C Haffner', 'David Esopi', 'Yasunori Kimura', 'Javaneh Jabbari', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Nicholas Erho', 'Ismael A Vergara', 'Sheila F Faraj', 'Elai Davicioni', 'George J Netto', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Steven S An', 'Edward M Schaeffer']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1) is down regulated in aggressive prostate cancers and is prognostic for poor clinical outcome.', 'SPARCL1 suppresses metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteines-like 1 suppresses aggressiveness and predicts better survival in colorectal cancers.', 'SPARCL1 a novel player in cancer biology.', 'Androgen action during prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Modeling Human Prostate Cancer Metastasis in Mice via Resection of Subcutaneous Allografts.', 'The KDM6A-SPARCL1 axis blocks metastasis and regulates the tumour microenvironment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p65.', 'SPARCL1 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Correlates with Tumor Microenvironment in Colorectal Cancer.', 'A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer.', 'Functionally heterogeneous human satellite cells identified by single cell RNA sequencing.']"""

Our aim was to measure PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG expression systematically in all regions of prostate cross-sections, matching the data to corresponding tissue morphology.  Methods:   TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3 mRNA levels were measured with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays in 270 samples from cross-sections of five radical prostatectomy specimens. ERG expression was examined by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   TMPRSS2-ERG mRNAs were detected in three patients and in 15 tissue samples in total. These included two carcinoma samples and 13 histologically benign samples, eight of which were located next to malignant tumours or PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions and five of which did not reside in the vicinity of any evident carcinoma foci. ERG protein expression was limited to areas of TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA expression, but did not identify all of them. PCA3 expression was detected in all five cross-sections, with statistically significant, three-fold higher expression in carcinoma regions.  Conclusions:   TMPRSS2-ERG expression was detected in carcinoma foci, regions next to them, and in samples not adjacent to carcinoma foci. Claimed as a cancer-associated phenomenon, this fusion gene measurement could, if validated with a larger cohort, be utilized as an addition to histological analysis to predict current or future cancer risk in men with negative biopsies.

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Embase up to April 2015 to identify relevant prospective observational studies. Summary relative risk (RR) and 95% CI were estimated using a random-effects model.

Evidence for non-linearity was not statistically significant (P non-linearity= 0·50, n 15,415 cases) but consuming ≥ 5 eggs/week was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer compared with no egg consumption, with the summary RR being 1·04 (95% CI 1·01, 1·07) for consuming 5 eggs/week and 1·09 (95% CI 1·03, 1·15) for consuming about 9 eggs/week. For other cancers investigated, the summary RR for an increase of 5 eggs consumed/week was 1·09 (95% CI 0·96, 1·24, n 2636 cases) for ovarian cancer; 1·47 (95% CI 1·01, 2·14, n 609 cases) for fatal prostate cancer, with evidence of small-study effects (P Egger= 0·04). No evidence was found for an association with the risk of total prostate cancer.

Objective:   To determine the probability of achieving good urinary function (UF) or erectile function (EF) up to 48 mo postoperatively in men who reported poor UF or EF at 12 mo after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 3187 patients who underwent RP from 2007 through 2013 at a tertiary institution and had extended multidisciplinary follow-up with patient-reported UF and EF scores at ≥12 mo.  Intervention:   Open or minimally invasive RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome was good UF as defined by a urinary score ≥17 (range: 0-21) or good EF as defined by a modified International Index of Erectile Function-6 score ≥22 (range: 1-30). The probability of functional recovery beyond 12 mo was determined by Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results and limitations:   Among patients incontinent at 12 mo, the probability of achieving good UF at 24, 36, and 48 mo was 30%, 49%, and 59%. In patients experiencing erectile dysfunction at 12 mo, the probability of recovering EF at 24, 36, and 48 mo was 22%, 32%, and 40%. On multivariable analyses, 12-mo functional score and age were associated with recovery, but only score was consistently significant.  Conclusions:   Men with incontinence or erectile dysfunction at 12 mo have higher than anticipated rates of subsequent functional improvement. Probability of recovery is strongly influenced by score at 12 mo. Further research should address the impact of ongoing multidisciplinary follow-up care on our observed rates of recovery.

Methods:   Analysis included 408 consecutive men with primary and prior negative biopsies who underwent TB and 10-core random biopsy (RB) between January 2012 and January 2015. TB was performed with a real-time MRI/US fusion platform with sensor-based registration. Clinically significant PCa was defined as Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7 or GS 6 with maximal cancer core length ≥ 4 mm for TB and according to Epstein criteria for RB.  Results:   The overall CDR was 56 % (227/408). The CDR for primary biopsy was 74 % (60/81) and 57 % (67/117), 49 % (62/126), 45 % (38/84) for patients with 1, 2 and ≥ 3 prior negative biopsies. CDRs correlated with PI-RADS 2/3/4/5 were 16 % (5/32), 26 % (29/113), 62 % (94/152) and 89 % (99/111), respectively. The rates of significant tumors in relation to PI-RADS 2/3/4/5 were 60 % (3/5), 66 % (19/29), 74 % (70/94), 95 % (94/99). In 139 (61 %) cases with radical prostatectomy (RP), the rates of ≥ pT3 tumors in correlation with PI-RADS 4 and 5 were 20 % (11/56) and 49 % (32/65). PI-RADS constituted the strongest predictor of significant PCa detection (p < 0.007).  Conclusions:   Real-time MRI/US fusion-guided TB combined with RB improved PCa detection in patients with primary and repeat biopsies. The CDR was strongly correlated with a rising PI-RADS score, values of 4 and 5 increasing the detection of clinically significant tumors and leading to a higher histological stage after RP.""","""['Hannes Cash', 'Andreas Maxeiner', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Thomas Fischer', 'Tahir Durmus', 'Josephine Holzmann', 'Patrick Asbach', 'Matthias Haas', 'Stefan Hinz', 'Jörg Neymeyer', 'Kurt Miller', 'Karsten Günzel', 'Carsten Kempkensteffen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Prostate cancer detection on transrectal ultrasonography-guided random biopsy despite negative real-time magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion-guided targeted biopsy: reasons for targeted biopsy failure.', 'Prospective Evaluation of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical value of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'A SelectMDx/magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection with mpMRI According to PI-RADS v2 Compared with Systematic MRI/TRUS-Fusion Biopsy: A Prospective Study.', 'Follow-up of men with a PI-RADS 4/5 lesion after negative MRI/Ultrasound fusion biopsy.']"""

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be an independent prognostic indicator in various advanced and localized cancers. We investigated the influence of markers of systemic inflammation such as leucocyte counts and metabolic co-morbidities on overall survival (OS) after radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the influence of the following factors on OS: age, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score as well as comorbidities associated with inflammation such as cardiac history, diabetes and use of a statin. A stepwise selection of variable based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used for multivariate analysis.  Results:   In total, 1772 pts were included; blood count data was available for 950 pts. Median age was 68 years (44-87). Actuarial 5 years OS and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) for the 1772 patients were 93% and 95%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 44 months (1-156). On univariate analysis, neutrophil count (p = 0.04), cardiac history (p = 0.008), age (p = 0.001) and CAPRA (p = 0.0002) were associated with OS. Lymphocytes, NLR and comorbidities other than cardiac history were not associated with mortality. On multivariate analysis, neutrophil count (HR = 1.18, 95 % CI: 1.017-1.37, p = 0.028), age (HR = 1.06, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.1, p = 0.008) and CAPRA (HR = 1.16, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.31, p = 0.015) were independent predictors of OS.  Conclusion:   Neutrophil count, as a possible marker of systemic inflammation, appear to be an independent prognostic factor for overall mortality in localized prostate cancer.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of prostate cancer includes the estimation of time activity curves (TACs), and thereby, the corresponding kinetic parameters (KPs), and plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. In this paper, we endeavor to develop a blind source separation algorithm, namely convex-optimization-based KPs estimation (COKE) algorithm for PK analysis based on compartmental modeling of DCE-MRI data, for effective prostate tumor detection and its quantification. The COKE algorithm first identifies the best three representative pixels in the DCE-MRI data, corresponding to the plasma, fast-flow, and slow-flow TACs, respectively. The estimation accuracy of the flux rate constants (FRCs) of the fast-flow and slow-flow TACs directly affects the estimation accuracy of the KPs that provide the cancer and normal tissue distribution maps in the prostate region. The COKE algorithm wisely exploits the matrix structure (Toeplitz, lower triangular, and exponential decay) of the original nonconvex FRCs estimation problem, and reformulates it into two convex optimization problems that can reliably estimate the FRCs. After estimation of the FRCs, the KPs can be effectively estimated by solving a pixel-wise constrained curve-fitting (convex) problem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed COKE algorithm. The COKE algorithm is also evaluated with DCE-MRI data of four different patients with prostate cancer and the obtained results are consistent with clinical observations.""","""['ArulMurugan Ambikapathi', 'Tsung-Han Chan', 'Chia-Hsiang Lin', 'Fei-Shih Yang', 'Chong-Yung Chi', 'Yue Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Optimized Fast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate: Effect of Sampling Duration on Pharmacokinetic Parameters.', 'Robust and efficient pharmacokinetic parameter non-linear least squares estimation for dynamic contrast enhanced MRI of the prostate.', 'Comparison of different population-averaged arterial-input-functions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the prostate: Effects on pharmacokinetic parameters and their diagnostic performance.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the prostate.', 'The Application of Radiomics in Breast MRI: A Review.', 'Radiomic analysis of imaging heterogeneity in tumours and the surrounding parenchyma based on unsupervised decomposition of DCE-MRI for predicting molecular subtypes of breast cancer.']"""

Since T plays an important role in androgen-sensitive diseases, this enzyme is thus an interesting therapeutic target. In an attempt to design compounds to lower the level of T, we synthesized androsterone derivatives substituted at position 3 as inhibitors of 17β-HSD3, and selected one of the most potent compounds for additional studies. In an enzymatic assay in homogenized and whole HEK-293 cells overexpressing 17β-HSD3, the inhibitor RM-532-105 efficiently inhibited the conversion of natural substrate 4-dione (50nM) into T with an IC50 of 26nM and 5nM, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitor RM-532-105 (10mg/kg) reached a plasma concentration of 250ng/mL at 7h (AUC 24h: 3485ngh/mL) after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in the rat. In order to mimic the human situation in which 4-dione is converted to T in the testis, we used intact rats. Treatment for 7 days with 17β-HSD3 inhibitor RM-532-105 by s.c. injection or oral gavage exerted no effect on the testis, prostate and seminal vesicle weight and no modification in the levels of plasma steroids. However, after this treatment, the concentration of inhibitor in plasma increased depending on the dose. We thereafter determined the concentration of inhibitor in the testis and we discovered that the compound was slightly present.

This region is believed to host multiple tumor suppressors. Chromosome Condensation 1-like (CHC1L) is located at 13q14, and found within the smallest common region of loss of heterozygosity in prostate cancer. Decreased expression of CHC1L is linked to pathogenesis and progression of both prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. However, there is no direct evidence for CHC1L's putative tumor suppressing role in current literature. Presently, we describe the generation and characterization of Chc1L knockout mice. Chc1L-/- mice do not develop cancer at a young age, but bone marrow and spleen cells from 8-12 week-old mice display an exaggerated proliferative response. By approximately two years of age, knockout and heterozygote mice have a markedly increased incidence of tumorigenesis compared to wild-type controls, with tumors occurring mainly in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and intestinal tract. Histopathological analysis found that most heterozygote and knockout mice succumb to either Histiocytic Sarcoma or Histiocyte-Associated Lymphoma. Our study suggests that Chc1L is involved in suppression of these two histiocyte-rich neoplasms in mice and supports clinical data suggesting that CHC1L loss of function is an important step in the pathogenesis of cancers containing 13q14 deletion.""","""['David R Spillane', 'Ding Yan Wang', 'Susan Newbigging', 'Youdong Wang', 'Chang-Xin Shi', 'Hae-Ra Cho', 'Hiroki Shimizu', 'Anthony Gramolini', 'Mingyao Liu', 'Xiao-Yan Wen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[]"""

The association between various risk factors and biochemical recurrence was then statistically evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   In the intermediate-risk group, 96 patients (14.5%) experienced biochemical recurrence during a median follow up of 41 months. In the intermediate-risk group, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen density were significant preoperative risk factors for biochemical recurrence, whereas other factors including age, primary Gleason 4, clinical stage >T2 and percentage of positive biopsies were not. In multivariate analysis, higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen level and density, and a smaller prostate volume were independent risk factors for biochemical recurrence in the intermediate-risk group. Biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients in the intermediate-risk group with a higher prostate-specific antigen level and density (≥15 ng/mL, ≥0.6 ng/mL/cm(3), respectively), and lower prostate volume (≤10 mL) was comparable with that of high-risk group individuals (P = 0.632, 0.494 and 0.961, respectively).

Even though there is strong evidence that the genetic component is significant in PrCa, the genetic etiology of familial and early-onset disease is largely unknown. Although it has been suggested that men from families with hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) and, more recently, with Lynch syndrome may have an increased risk for PrCa, the contribution of these syndromes to PrCa predisposition in families ascertained for early-onset and/or familial PrCa, independently of the presence of other cancers in the family, is uncertain. To quantify the contribution of genes associated with HBOC and Lynch syndromes to PrCa predisposition, we have tested for germline mutations 460 early-onset and/or familial PrCa patients. All patients were screened for the six mutations that are particularly common in Portugal and 38 of them were selected for complete sequencing of BRCA1/2 and/or MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Two patients were found to harbor the same MSH2 mutation and a third patient carried a Portuguese BRCA2 founder mutation. None of the alterations were identified in 288 control subjects. Furthermore, we reviewed the 62 PrCa diagnoses in all HBOC (n = 161) and Lynch syndrome (n = 124) families previously diagnosed at our department, and found five other BRCA2 mutation carriers and two additional MSH2 mutation carriers.

Furthermore, some similar molecular mechanisms are shared between RA and other immune diseases. Therefore it is vital to reveal the molecular mechanism of RA through searching for subpathways of immune diseases and investigating the crosstalk effect among subpathways. Here we exploited an integrated approach combining both construction of a subpathway-subpathway interaction network and a random walk strategy to prioritize RA risk subpathways. Our research can be divided into three parts: (1) acquisition of risk genes and identification of risk subpathways of 85 immune diseases by using subpathway-lenient distance similarity (subpathway-LDS) method; (2) construction of a global immune subpathway interaction (GISI) network with subpathways identified by subpathway-LDS; (3) optimization of RA risk subpathways by random walk strategy based on GISI network. The results showed that our method could effectively identify RA risk subpathways, such as MAPK signaling pathway, prostate cancer pathway and chemokine signaling pathway. The integrated strategy considering crosstalk between immune subpathways significantly improved the effect of risk subpathway identification.

Because of these numbers, efforts to improve early detection, accurate assessment of disease burden, and appropriate treatment options are important public health priorities. However, the basic tool for diagnosis, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy, is flawed by failure to detect many serious cancers (>30% false negative rate)and over-detection of nonserious cancers. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate empowers the clinician to identify tumors that would otherwise be missed by conventional techniques and to record the precise locations of positive cores through targeted biopsy using MRI‑ultrasound (MRI‑US) fusion. As mpMRI advances and the level of experience for the user grows, the correlation between the level of suspicion for a prostate lesion and the MRI‑US fusion targeted biopsy revealing malignancy improves.

We related indicators of mortality reduction and overdetection by center within the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening (ERSPC).  Experimental design:   We analyzed the absolute mortality reduction expressed as number needed to invite (NNI = 1/absolute risk reduction; indicating how many men had to be randomized to screening arm to avert a prostate cancer death) for screening and the absolute excess of prostate cancer detection as number needed for overdetection (NNO = 1/absolute excess incidence; indicating the number of men invited per additional prostate cancer case), and compared their relationship across the seven ERSPC centers.  Results:   Both absolute mortality reduction (NNI) and absolute overdetection (NNO) varied widely between the centers: NNI, 200-7,000 and NNO, 16-69. Extent of overdiagnosis and mortality reduction was closely associated [correlation coefficient, r = 0.76; weighted linear regression coefficient, β = 33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5-62; R(2) = 0.72]. For an averted prostate cancer death at 13 years of follow-up, 12 to 36 excess cases had to be detected in various centers.  Conclusions:   The differences between the ERSPC centers likely reflect variations in prostate cancer incidence and mortality, as well as in screening protocol and performance. The strong interrelation between the benefits and harms suggests that efforts to maximize the mortality effect are bound to increase overdiagnosis and might be improved by focusing on high-risk populations. The optimal balance between screening intensity and risk of overdiagnosis remains unclear.""","""['Anssi Auvinen', 'Sue M Moss', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Sigrid Carlsson', 'Gunnar Aus', 'Marco Zappa', 'Donella Puliti', 'Louis J Denis', 'Vera Nelen', 'Maciej Kwiatkowski', 'Marco Randazzo', 'Alvaro Paez', 'Marcos Lujan', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Correction: Absolute Effect of Prostate Cancer Screening: Balance of Benefits and Harms by Center within the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.', 'Lead times and overdetection due to prostate-specific antigen screening: estimates from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Ki67 and the apparent diffusion coefficient in postoperative prostate cancer with endocrine therapy.', 'Complexities of Prostate Cancer.', 'Half of germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants found on panel tests do not fulfil NHS testing criteria.', 'Association of MyProstateScore (MPS) with prostate cancer grade in the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Use of the MyProstateScore Test to Rule Out Clinically Significant Cancer: Validation of a Straightforward Clinical Testing Approach.']"""

However, de novo or adaptive resistance to abiraterone limits its activity. Rational combinations of drugs with different mechanisms of action that overcome resistance mechanisms may improve the efficacy of therapy. To that end, we studied the molecular and phenotypic effects of the combination of cabozantinib plus abiraterone.  Experimental design:   Three prostate cancer cell lines were used to interrogate the in vitro molecular and antiproliferative effects of the single agents and combination of cabozantinib and abiraterone. The in vivo impact of the combination was assessed using the LAPC4-CR xenograft mouse model.  Results:   In vitro proliferation studies demonstrated single-agent doses between 2 μmol/L and 10 μmol/L for abiraterone and cabozantinib inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and the anticancer activity of abiraterone is enhanced when combined with cabozantinib. In vivo LAPC4-CR xenograft mouse studies also showed that cabozantinib can improve the antitumor activity of abiraterone. Cabozantinib, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, enhances the ability of abiraterone to inhibit AR activity in a cell line-dependent manner. In addition, our cell line studies demonstrate abiraterone-stimulated insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) phosphorylation with downstream activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, and that this potential adaptive resistance mechanism was inhibited by cabozantinib.  Conclusions:   Cabozantinib can enhance the efficacy of abiraterone by blocking multiple compensatory survival mechanisms, including IGFIR activation, and supports the assessment of the combination in a clinical trial.""","""['Xiaodong Wang', 'Ying Huang', 'Amanda Christie', 'Michaela Bowden', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Christopher J Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Integrating Murine and Clinical Trials with Cabozantinib to Understand Roles of MET and VEGFR2 as Targets for Growth Inhibition of Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabozantinib inhibits prostate cancer growth and prevents tumor-induced bone lesions.', 'Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.', 'Cabozantinib: a novel agent with a dual mechanism of action for castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.', 'Current role of cabozantinib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Overcoming Compensatory Mechanisms toward Chronic Drug Administration to Ensure Long-Term, Sustainable Beneficial Effects.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling in tumorigenesis and drug resistance: a challenge for cancer therapy.', 'Recruitment of miR-8080 by luteolin inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabozantinib (XL184) and R428 (BGB324) Inhibit the Growth of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC).', 'Second-Generation Antiandrogens: From Discovery to Standard of Care in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Findings:   Age-related BTL attrition was faster in cancer cases pre-diagnosis than in cancer-free participants (pdifference = 0.017); all participants had similar age-adjusted BTL 8-14 years pre-diagnosis, followed by decelerated attrition in cancer cases resulting in longer BTL three (p = 0.003) and four (p = 0.012) years pre-diagnosis.

To identify novel biomarkers for urothelial carcinoma, we performed quantitative proteomics on pooled urine pairs from patients with and without urothelial carcinoma.  Experimental design:   Shot-gun proteomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and stable isotope dimethyl labeling identified 219 candidate proteins. The potential implication of SH3 domain binding glutamic acid-rich protein like 3 (SH3BGRL3) was examined by immunoblotting of the urine (n = 13) and urothelial tumors (n = 32). Additional immunohistochemistry was performed on bladder cancer array (n = 1145) and correlated with tumor aggressiveness. Then, biologic functions and signaling pathways of SH3BGRL3 were explored using stable cell lines.  Results:   The detectable urine SH3BGRL3 in patients with urothelial carcinoma was positively associated with higher histologic grading and muscle invasiveness of urothelial carcinoma. SH3BGRL3 is expressed in 13.9% (159/1145) of bladder cancer cohort and is positively associated with muscle invasion (P = 0.0028). SH3BGRL3 expression is associated with increased risk of progression in patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (P = 0.032). SH3BGRL3 expression is significantly associated with a high level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in bladder cancer (P < 0.0001). SH3BGRL3 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and proliferation of urothelial carcinoma in vitro. SH3BGRL3 interacts with phosphor-EGFR at Y1068, Y1086, and Y1173 through Grb2 by its proline-rich motif, and activates the Akt-associated signaling pathway.

Additionally, when controlling for clinical stage, three cycles of GC, compared to four, were significantly associated with higher rates of pT4 disease and lower rates of downstaging to non-muscle-invasive disease.

NOTA-MAL-FSH2 was obtained with about 50% yield and labeled using (18)F-Al in a one-step method within 20 min with a yield of 41.46 ± 10.36% (non-decay-corrected). The radiochemical purity was more than 95% and the specific activity was more than 50 GBq/µmol. The in vitro stability studies were determined in PBS and human serum. (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH2 remained stable in PBS and human serum. Balb/c nude mice bearing PC-3 human PCa were used for in vivo study. PC-3 tumors were clearly visualized with good contrast to background through microPET. ROI analysis showed the tumor uptake values were 2.68 ± 0.52 and 1.97 ± 0.61%ID/g at 30 and 60 min post injection (p.i.), respectively. Biodistribution studies showed that the accumulations of (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH2 in liver and intestine were 0.47 ± 0.11 and 0.12 ± 0.03%ID/g respectively at 60 min p.i. FSHR-binding specificity was also demonstrated by reduced tumor uptake after coinjection of excessive unlabeled FSH2. In conclusion, (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH2 was successfully prepared in a one-step method and showed better pharmacokinetics than (18) F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1. Favorable preclinical study revealed that (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH2 appears to be a promising candidate for FSHR-positive tumor imaging.""","""['Chen Zhu', 'Qing Xu', 'Donghui Pan', 'Yuping Xu', 'Ping Liu', 'Runlin Yang', 'Lizhen Wang', 'Xinchen Sun', 'Shineng Luo', 'Min Yang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Contrast Media Mol Imaging""","""['Pilot study of a novel (18)F-labeled FSHR probe for tumor imaging.', 'PET Imaging of FSHR Expression in Tumors with 68Ga-Labeled FSH1 Peptide.', 'PET imaging of prostate tumors with 18F-Al-NOTA-MATBBN.', 'A new (68)Ga-labeled BBN peptide with a hydrophilic linker for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', '18F-Containing Positron Emission Tomography Probe Conjugation Methodology for Biologics as Specific Binders for Tumors.', 'PET imaging of retinal inflammation in mice exposed to blue light using 18F-DPA-714.', 'Targeting HER2-positive gastric cancer with a novel 18F-labeled ZHER2:342 probe.', 'PET imaging of a 68Ga labeled modified HER2 affibody in breast cancers: from xenografts to patients.', 'A Comprehensive Review of Non-Covalent Radiofluorination Approaches Using Aluminum 18Ffluoride: Will 18FAlF Replace 68Ga for Metal Chelate Labeling?', 'Molecular regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone synthesis, secretion and action.']"""

In many types of cancer, the expression profiles of these miRNAs are altered. Recently, miR-101 was identified as a tumour suppressor and was found to be expressed at low levels in various types of tumours, including prostate, breast, endometrium, and bladder cancers. However, the function(s) of miR-101 in laryngeal carcinoma remain unknown.  Methods:   The expression levels of miR-101 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tissues and cells were detected by qPCR. Cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis assay were applied to assess the function(s) of miR-101 in vitro. Nude mice subcutaneous tumour model was used to perform in vivo study. Moreover, we identified Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) as the target of miR-101 by a luciferase assay. The possible downstream effectors of CDK8 were investigated in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Changes of CDK8, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 protein levels were analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. The prognostic effect of miR-101 was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Expression of miR-101 was down-regulated in the LSCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-101 correlated with T3-4 tumour grade, lymph node metastasis, and an advanced clinical stage in the LSCC patients examined (P < 0.05). The low level of miR-101 expression was associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.05). CDK8 was identified as the target gene of miR-101 by luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, we showed that up-regulation of miR-101 expression suppressed humen LSCC Hep-2 cells proliferation and migration, and induced cell-cycle arrest. Increased expression of miR-101 induced cells apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, exogenous expression of miR-101 significantly reduced the growth of tumour in a LSCC xenograft model. Furthermore, the miR-101 level was inversely correlated with levels of CDK8, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 in western blotting assay and immunohistochemical staining assay.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that miR-101 is a potent tumour repressor that directly represses CDK8 expression. Thus, detection and targeting of miR-101 may represent a novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for LSCC patients.""","""['MingHua Li', 'LinLi Tian', 'Hui Ren', 'XiaoXue Chen', 'Yu Wang', 'JingChun Ge', 'ShuLiang Wu', 'YaNan Sun', 'Ming Liu', 'Hui Xiao']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Aberrant expression of CDK8 regulates the malignant phenotype and associated with poor prognosis in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Downregulated Chibby in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with increased expression in laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells.', 'Down-regulation of MiR-206 promotes proliferation and invasion of laryngeal cancer by regulating VEGF expression.', 'The role of microRNAs expression in laryngeal cancer.', 'The emerging role of miR-506 in cancer.', 'Regulation of the Cell Cycle by ncRNAs Affects the Efficiency of CDK4/6 Inhibition.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as new tools for delivery of miRNAs in the treatment of cancer.', 'Overview on Molecular Biomarkers for Laryngeal Cancer: Looking for New Answers to an Old Problem.', 'A Clinical Update on the Prognostic Effect of microRNA Biomarkers for Survival Outcome in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'MicroRNA as a Novel Biomarker in the Diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

Most existing cancer classification methods based on gene or metabolite biomarkers were limited to single genomics or metabolomics, and lacked integration and utilization of multiple 'omics' data. The accuracy and robustness of these methods when applied to independent cohorts of patients must be improved. In this study, we propose a directed random walk-based method to evaluate the topological importance of each gene in a reconstructed gene-metabolite graph by integrating information from matched gene expression profiles and metabolomic profiles. The joint use of gene and metabolite information contributes to accurate evaluation of the topological importance of genes and reproducible pathway activities. We constructed classifiers using reproducible pathway activities for precise cancer classification and risk metabolic pathway identification. We applied the proposed method to the classification of prostate cancer. Within-dataset experiments and cross-dataset experiments on three independent datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a more accurate and robust overall performance compared to several existing classification methods.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of 633 PCas who had whole-body bone scan (WBBS) between 2008 and 2014. We recorded the age, clinical T-stage, total PSA (tPSA) prior to biopsy, Gleason sum (GS), and PNI in transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (TRUS-Bx) and digital rectal examination findings. Bone metastases were assessed with WBBS and magnetic resonance image if WBBS was suspicious. We divided the patients into two groups according to NCCN criteria: (Group 1) bone scan not indicated, (Group 2) bone scan indicated.  Results:   There were 262 patients in Group 1 and 371 in 2. There is not significant relationship between PNI and bone metastasis in Group 1. However, there is very limited number of metastatic patients (n = 12) in this group. There is a strong relationship between PNI and bone metastasis in Group 2 (P = 0.001). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of PNI for bone metastasis were 72.4%, 81.7%, and 77.7%, respectively. In this group, tPSA, GS, positive DRE, and PNI were significant covariates for prediction of bone metastasis in univariate and multivariate analysis (except age). The most powerful predictor was PNI, and it increased the risk of bone metastasis 11-fold.

Unfortunately, the most commonly used PET radiotracer, ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), has not demonstrated a definitive role in determining response to therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). As a result, new radiotracers able to reliably image RCC could be of tremendous value for this purpose.  Methods:   Five patients with known metastatic RCC were imaged with the low-molecular weight radiotracer ¹⁸F-DCFPyL, an inhibitor of the prostate-specific membrane antigen at 60 min post injection. ¹⁸F-DCFPyL PET/CT and conventional images (either contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were centrally reviewed for suspected sites of disease.  Results:   In all five patients imaged, sites of putative metastatic disease were readily identifiable by abnormal ¹⁸F-DCFPyL uptake, with overall more lesions detected than on conventional imaging. These PET-detected sites included lymph nodes, pancreatic parenchymal lesions, lung parenchymal lesions, a brain parenchymal lesion, and other soft tissue sites. ¹⁸F-DCFPyL uptake ranged from subtle to intense with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) for the identified lesions of 1.6-19.3. Based upon this small patient series, limited pathology and imaging follow-up of these patients suggests a higher sensitivity for ¹⁸F-DCFPyL compared to conventional imaging in the detection of metastatic RCC (94.7 versus 78.9%).  Conclusions:   PSMA expression in the tumor neovasculature of RCC has been previously established and is believed to provide the basis for the imaging findings presented here.

Various methods have been used to identify SREs from claims data. The objective of this study was to provide a framework for measuring SREs from claims and compare SRE prevalence and cumulative incidence estimates based on alternative approaches in men with mPC.  Methods:   Several claims-based approaches for identifying SREs were developed and applied to data for men aged [greater than or equal to] 66 years newly diagnosed with mPC between 2000 and 2009 in the SEER-Medicare datasets and followed through 2010 or until censoring. Post-diagnosis SREs were identified using claims that indicated spinal cord compression (SCC), pathologic fracture (PF), surgery to bone (BS), or radiation (suggestive of bone palliative radiation, RAD). To measure SRE prevalence, two SRE definitions were created: 'base case' (most commonly used in the literature) and 'alternative' in which different claims were used to identify each type of SRE. To measure cumulative incidence, we used the 'base case' definition and applied three periods in which claims were clustered to episodes: 14-, 21-, and 28-day windows.  Results:   Among 8997 mPC patients, 46 % experienced an SRE according to the 'base case' definition and 43 % patients experienced an SRE according to the 'alternative' definition. Varying the code definition from 'base case' to 'alternative' resulted in an 8 % increase in the overall SRE prevalence. Using the 21-day window, a total of 12,930 SRE episodes were observed during follow up. Varying the window length from 21 to 28 days resulted in an 8 % decrease in SRE cumulative incidence (RAD: 10 %, PF: 8 %, SCC: 6 %, BS: 0.2 %).  Conclusions:   SRE prevalence was affected by the codes used, with PF being most impacted. The overall SRE cumulative incidence was affected by the window length used, with RAD being most affected. These results underscore the importance of the baseline definitions used to study claims data when attempting to understand relevant clinical events such as SREs in the real world setting.""","""['Abdalla Aly', 'Eberechukwu Onukwugha', 'Corinne Woods', 'C Daniel Mullins', 'Young Kwok', 'Yi Qian', 'Jorge Arellano', 'Arun Balakumaran', 'Arif Hussain']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['Risk of skeletal related events among elderly prostate cancer patients by site of metastasis at diagnosis.', 'Payer costs for inpatient treatment of pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression among patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis secondary to prostate or breast cancer.', 'Skeletal-related events and mortality among older men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Burden of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer: unmet need in pain improvement.', 'Clinical and economic burden of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events in prostate cancer.', 'Risk factors associated with skeletal-related events following discontinuation of denosumab treatment among patients with bone metastases from solid tumors: A real-world machine learning approach.', 'Advancing Treatment of Bone Metastases through Novel Translational Approaches Targeting the Bone Microenvironment.', 'Discharge status and post-discharge healthcare costs after skeletal-related event hospitalizations among medicare patients with bone metastatic solid tumors or multiple myeloma.', 'Pathogenic Mechanisms of Myeloma Bone Disease and Possible Roles for NRF2.', 'Utilization of novel systemic therapies for multiple myeloma: A retrospective study of front-line regimens using the SEER-Medicare data.']"""

Design:   Two prospective cohort studies.  Setting:   Health professionals in the United States.  Participants:   88,084 women and 47,881 men participating in the Nurses' Health Study (from 1980) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (from 1986), followed until 2010.  Main outcomes and measures:   Relative risks of cancer.  Results:   19,269 and 7571 (excluding non-advanced prostate cancers) incident cancers were documented among women and men, respectively, over 3,144,853 person years. Compared with non-drinkers, light to moderate drinkers had relative risks of total cancer of 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.06) and 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09; P(trend) = 0.12) for alcohol intake of 0.1-4.9 and 5-14.9 g/day among women, respectively. Corresponding values for men were 1.03 (0.96 to 1.11), 1.05 (0.97 to 1.12), and 1.06 (0.98 to 1.15; P(trend) = 0.31) for alcohol intake of 0.1-4.9, 5-14.9, and 15-29.9 g/day, respectively. Associations for light to moderate drinking and total cancer were similar among ever or never smokers, although alcohol consumption above moderate levels (in particular ≥ 30 g/day) was more strongly associated with risk of total cancer among ever smokers than never smokers. For a priori defined alcohol related cancers in men, risk was not appreciably increased for light and moderate drinkers who never smoked (P(trend) = 0.18). However, for women, even an alcohol consumption of 5-14.9 g/day was associated with increased risk of alcohol related cancer (relative risk 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.20)), driven by breast cancer. More frequent and heavy episodic drinking was not further associated with risk of total cancer after adjusting for total alcohol intake.  Conclusion:   Light to moderate drinking is associated with minimally increased risk of overall cancer. For men who have never smoked, risk of alcohol related cancers is not appreciably increased for light and moderate drinking (up to two drinks per day).

In the effort to find new anti-leukemic agents, we evaluated the small drug SB225002 (N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N'-(2-bromophenyl)urea). Although initially described as a selective antagonist of CXCR2, later studies have identified other cellular targets for SB225002, with potential medicinal use in cancer. We found that SB225002 has a significant pro-apoptotic effect against both B- and T-ALL cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that treatment with SB225002 induces G2-M cell cycle arrest. Transcriptional profiling revealed that SB225002-mediated apoptosis triggered a transcriptional program typical of tubulin binding agents. Network analysis revealed the activation of genes linked to the JUN and p53 pathways and inhibition of genes linked to the TNF pathway. Early cellular effects activated by SB225002 included the up-regulation of GLIPR1, a p53-target gene shown to have pro-apoptotic activities in prostate and bladder cancer. Silencing of GLIPR1 in B- and T-ALL cell lines resulted in increased resistance to SB225002. Although SB225002 promoted ROS increase in ALL cells, antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine pre-treatment only modestly attenuated cell death, implying that the pro-apoptotic effects of SB225002 are not exclusively mediated by ROS. Moreover, GLIPR1 silencing resulted in increased ROS levels both in untreated and SB225002-treated cells. In conclusion, SB225002 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in different B- and T-ALL cell lines. Inhibition of tubulin function with concurrent activation of the p53 pathway, in particular, its downstream target GLIPR1, seems to underlie the anti-leukemic effect of SB225002.""","""['Jaíra Ferreira de Vasconcellos', 'Angelo Brunelli Albertoni Laranjeira', 'Paulo C Leal', 'Manoj K Bhasin', 'Priscila Pini Zenatti', 'Ricardo J Nunes', 'Rosendo A Yunes', 'Alexandre E Nowill', 'Towia A Libermann', 'Luiz Fernando Zerbini', 'José Andrés Yunes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 performs dual functions in tumor cells.', 'SB225002 promotes mitotic catastrophe in chemo-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells independent of p53 status in vitro.', 'Cytotoxic effect of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells: implication for targeted therapy.', 'Mechanism of synergy of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide and ABT-737 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines: Mcl-1 inactivation.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1: tumor-suppressor activities and therapeutic potential.', 'Combining TMZ and SB225002 induces changes of CXCR2 and VEGFR signalling in primary human endothelial cells in\xa0vitro.', 'Tumor-Associated Microglia/Macrophages as a Predictor for Survival in Glioblastoma and Temozolomide-Induced Changes in CXCR2 Signaling with New Resistance Overcoming Strategy by Combination Therapy.', 'Key genes and drug delivery systems to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy.', 'The CXCL2/IL8/CXCR2 Pathway Is Relevant for Brain Tumor Malignancy and Endothelial Cell Function.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 performs dual functions in tumor cells.']"""

Bladder neck contractures developed in 13 patients (81.3%), whose treatment (endoscopic or open reconstruction) resulted in urinary leak leading to urosymphyseal fistulas. Reconstruction was possible in 7 of 15 patients (46.7%) with salvage radical prostatectomy and substitution/augmentation cystoplasty. The other 8 patients (53.3%) underwent cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion. All patients experienced resolution of symptoms, most significantly the almost immediate resolution of pain.  Conclusions:   A high index of suspicion must be maintained in irradiated patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of urosymphyseal fistulas, especially after having undergone treatment of bladder neck contractures or prostatic urethral stenoses. Although extensive, surgery for urosymphyseal fistulas, with a high risk of morbidity and mortality and a protracted recovery, leads to immediate and dramatic improvement in symptoms.""","""['Simon Bugeja', 'Daniela E Andrich', 'Anthony R Mundy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Urosymphyseal Fistulas Resulting From Endoscopic Treatment of Radiation-induced Posterior Urethral Strictures.', 'Robot Assisted Cystectomy With Holmium Laser Debridement for Osteomyelitis of the Pubic Symphysis With Urinary Fistula.', 'Necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer: a case report.', 'Current status of local salvage therapies following radiation failure for prostate cancer.', 'Prostato-symphyseal fistula after photoselective vaporization of the prostate: case series and literature review of a rare complication.', 'Corpus spongiosum flap: a unique technique in the management of urosymphyseal fistula.', 'Pubic symphysis septic arthritis due to urosymphyseal fistula: Conservative management can work.', 'Imaging findings of urosymphyseal fistulas.', 'Simultaneous treatment of a pubovesical fistula and lymph node metastasis secondary to multimodal treatment for prostate cancer: Case report and review of the literature.', 'Management of osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis following urinary fistula in patients with radiation-induced urethral strictures after prostate cancer treatment.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality of a zoomed EPI (z-EPI) sequence in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate in comparison to a conventional single-shot EPI using single-channel (c-EPI1) and multi-channel (c-EPI2) RF excitation, with and without use of an endorectal coil.  Materials and methods:   33 consecutive patients (mean age: 61 +/- 9 years; mean PSA: 8.67±6.23 ng/ml) with examinations between 10/2012 and 02/2014 were analyzed in this retrospective study. In 26 of 33 patients the initial multiparametric (mp)-MRI was performed on a whole-body 3T scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using an endorectal coil (c (conventional)-EPI1). Zoomed-EPI (Z-EPI) examinations of these patients and a complete mp-MRI protocol including c-EPI2 of 7 additional patients were carried out on another 3T wb MR scanner with two-channel dynamic parallel transmit capability (Magnetom Skyra with TimTX TrueShape, Siemens). For z-EPI, the one-dimensional spatially selective RF excitation pulse was replaced by a two-dimensional RF pulse. Degree of image blur and susceptibility artifacts (0=not present to 3= non-diagnostic), maximum image distortion (mm), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, as well as overall scan preference were evaluated. SNR maps were generated to compare c-EPI2 and z-EPI.  Results:   Overall image quality of z-EPI was preferred by both readers in all examinations with a single exception. Susceptibility artifacts were rated significantly lower on z-EPI compared to both other methods (z-EPI vs c-EPI1: p<0.01; z-EPI vs c-EPI2: p<0.01) as well as image blur (z-EPI vs c-EPI1: p<0.01; z-EPI vs c-EPI2: p<0.01). Image distortion was not statistically significantly reduced with z-EPI (z-EPI vs c-EPI1: p=0.12; z-EPI vs c-EPI2: p=0.42). Interobserver agreement for ratings of susceptibility artifacts, image blur and overall scan preference was good. SNR was higher for z-EPI than for c-EPI1 (n=1).  Conclusion:   Z-EPI leads to significant improvements in image quality and artifacts as well as image blur reduction improving prostate DWI and enabling accurate fusion with conventional sequences. The improved fusion could lead to advantages in the field of MRI-guided biopsy suspicous lesions and performance of locally ablative procedures for prostate cancer.""","""['Ulrike I Attenberger', 'Nils Rathmann', 'Metin Sertdemir', 'Philipp Riffel', 'Anja Weidner', 'Stefan Kannengiesser', 'John N Morelli', 'Stefan O Schoenberg', 'Daniel Hausmann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Renal zoomed EPI-DWI with spatially-selective radiofrequency excitation pulses in two dimensions.', 'Zoomed EPI-DWI of the pancreas using two-dimensional spatially-selective radiofrequency excitation pulses.', 'Zoomed echo-planar imaging using parallel transmission: impact on image quality of diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate at 3T.', 'Practical aspects of assessing tumors using clinical diffusion-weighted imaging in the body.', 'Diffusion imaging of the vertebral bone marrow.', 'Added value of zoomed-echo-planar imaging diffusion-weighted imaging for evaluation of periampullary carcinomas.', 'A feasibility study of reduced full-of-view synthetic high-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging in uterine tumors.', 'The Evaluation of Zoomed Echo-Planar Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Two-dimensional Spatial-Selective Radiofrequency Excitation Pulses in Patients With Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma.', ""Comparative Study between ZOOMit and Conventional Intravoxel Incoherent Motion MRI for Assessing Parotid Gland Abnormalities in Patients with Early- or Mid-Stage Sjögren's Syndrome."", 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   This post hoc analysis pooled data from four double-blind studies in which 1498 men with > 6-mo history of LUTS/BPH were randomised and received either once-daily placebo (n = 746) or tadalafil 5 mg (n = 752) for 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics were reported for changes in total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS voiding and storage subscores, and IPSS quality-of-life (QoL) index. Treatment group differences by baseline clinical and cardiovascular factors and medical therapies were examined using analysis of covariance.  Results:   Tadalafil was effective in men with LUTS/BPH and cardiovascular risk factors/comorbidities except for patients receiving > 1 antihypertensive medication. Placebo-adjusted least squares (LS) mean improvements in total IPSS were -1.2 (95% CI: -2.5 to -0.0) in men taking > 1 antihypertensive medication vs. -3.3 (95% CI: -4.4 to -2.1) in men taking one medication (interaction p = 0.020). In addition, placebo-adjusted LS mean improvements in total IPSS were -0.2 (95% CI, -2.1 to 1.7) in men who reported use of diuretics vs. -2.8 (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.9) in men who reported taking other antihypertensive medications vs. -2.3 (95% CI, -3.2 to -1.5) in men who reported not using any antihypertensive drug (p-value for interaction = 0.053).  Conclusions:   Once-daily tadalafil 5 mg improved LUTS/BPH, regardless of severity, in men with coexisting cardiovascular risk factors/comorbidities, except for patients with history of > 1 drug for arterial hypertension.

Regarding the previous studies in literature predominant mutations take place in KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR genes in special types of cancers. In this research, we attempt to identify the prevalence and significant role of the possible mutations in EGFR exons 18-21, KRAS codon 12, 13, and 61, and BRAF codon 600 mutations in tumoral tissue specimens from patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, in this research, it has been attempted to investigate the molecular characteristics of these genes in terms of bioinformatic aspects.  Methods:   A total of 35 prostatic adenocarcinoma fresh tissue samples, enriched in neoplastic cells, were obtained from the Cancer Institute of Iran. The presence of mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61 of KRAS, codon 600 of BRAF and EGFR exons 18-21 were determined by direct Sanger sequencing. To evaluate the molecular features, structure, and post-translation modification of those genes, a bioinformatics survey was performed using the SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) and NetPhos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) Server. Also, using bioinformatics software, the phylogeny tree of the mutations was drawn.  Results:   Mutations of codons 12 and 13 of KRAS were found in 2 of the 35 prostatic adenocarcinomas. Two cases carried homozygous mutations on exon 2 in codon 12 (G12V) and codon 13 (G13D). Also, no mutation was detected at BRAF codon 600 and EGFR exons 18-21 in any of the samples.  Conclusions:   Based on the group of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma, our research shows that the mutations in codons 12 and 13 of KRAS are the most common in prostate carcinomas. Noting these results and the molecular pathway of this gene, there is a possible more perceptible role for this gene in the pathogenesis of prostatic carcinoma. However, according to our finding, as in previous studies, the role of BRAF and EGFR gene mutations in prostate adenocarcinoma are less than in the KRAS gene and, therefore, we assume that these common mutations of the KRAS gene can be used as an early determining marker for early diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. In the future, due to the complexity of etiological parameters in prostate cancer development, the case specific tumor molecular identification and treatment for each affected subject are urgently needed.""","""['Arash Salmaninejad', 'Shirin Ghadami', 'Majid Zaki Dizaji', 'Zahra Golchehre', 'Mehrdad Asghari Estiar', 'Mohammad Reza Zamani', 'Reza Ebrahimzadeh-Vesal', 'Mohammad Reza Nowroozi', 'Abbas Shakoori']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Detection of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR gene mutations in colorectal carcinoma.', 'Clinical pharmacogenomic testing of KRAS, BRAF and EGFR mutations by high resolution melting analysis and ultra-deep pyrosequencing.', 'Mutation analysis of BRAF exon 15 and KRAS codons 12 and 13 in Moroccan patients with colorectal cancer.', 'The predictive value of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN for anti-EGFR treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Are KRAS/BRAF mutations potent prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in colorectal cancers?', 'Arsenite malignantly transforms human prostate epithelial cells in vitro by gene amplification of mutated KRAS.', 'Molecular Status of BRAF Mutation in Prostate Adenocarcinoma: The Analysis of 100 Cases in North-East of IRAN.', 'Nasoethmoidal Intestinal-Type Adenocarcinoma Treated with Cetuximab: Role of Liquid Biopsy and BEAMing in Predicting Response to Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Therapy.', 'Mutant Kras-induced upregulation of CD24 enhances prostate cancer stemness and bone metastasis.', 'HER2 gene amplification in patients with prostate cancer: Evaluating a CISH-based method.']"""

Experimental studies demonstrated that lycopene inhibits the growth of various cancer cells of different organs and prevent chemically induced carcinogenesis in animal models. Although the excellent antioxidant property of lycopene is most likely the basis for its preventive role toward cancer, the direct anticancer activities of lycopene through multiple mechanisms are disclosed, including regulation of growth factor signaling, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis induction, and changes in antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. The anti-inflammatory activity of lycopene is also considered as an important determinant that suppresses the promotion and progression of carcinogenesis. Moreover, lycopene inhibits cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Importantly, those activities have been shown to be exhibited at the physiologically attainable concentration in humans. Although the preclinical data strongly suggest an antitumor activity of lycopene, a number of epidemiological and intervention studies indicate that there is still no clear clinical evidence that supports its use for the prevention of those cancers. More well controlled clinical intervention trials are needed to further clarify the exact role of lycopene in the cancer prevention. Nonetheless, because of its multiple tumor-inhibitory activities, lycopene still remains to be an attractive and promising carotenoid that will potentially contribute to the prevention and treatment of human cancers.

However, prospective epidemiological studies on the consequences of differing immune tolerance levels prior to clinical manifestation are missing.  Methods:   A case-cohort study embedded in EPIC-Heidelberg was conducted comprising incident cases of breast (n = 399), colorectal (n = 185), lung (n = 149), and prostate (n = 378) cancer, which occurred during 6.6 years of follow-up, and a subcohort (n = 807). Foxp3+ regulatory T-lymphocytes and CD3+ T-lymphocytes were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based DNA methylation analysis in prediagnostic leukocyte samples. Hazard ratios (HRs) for associations of cancer risk with the ratio of both parameters, the ""cellular ratio of immune tolerance"" (ImmunoCRIT), were estimated using Cox regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   ImmunoCRIT values were positively associated with the risk of lung (highest vs lowest tertile, HR = 1.98, 95% confidence interval = 1.06 to 3.69, P trend = .0263) and colorectal cancer (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.99 to 2.54, P trend = .0069) after multivariable adjustment, but not with prostate cancer risk.

Most PK models require the time course of contrast agent concentration in blood plasma as an input, which cannot be measured directly at the tissue of interest, and is approximated with an arterial input function (AIF). Variability in methods used in estimating the AIF and inter-observer variability in region of interest selection are major sources of discrepancy between different studies. This study had two aims. The first was to determine whether a local vascular input function (VIF) estimated using an adaptive complex independent component analysis (AC-ICA) algorithm could be used to estimate PK parameters from clinical dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI studies. The second aim was to determine whether normalizing the input function using its area under the curve would improve the results of PK analysis. AC-ICA was applied to DCE-MRI of 27 prostate cancer patients and the intravascular signal was estimated. This signal was converted into contrast agent concentration to give a local vascular input function (VIF) which was used as the input function for PK analysis. We compared K(trans) values for normal peripheral zone (PZ) and tumor tissues using the local VIF with those calculated using a conventional AIF obtained from the femoral artery. We also compared the K(trans) values obtained from the un-normalized input functions with the KN(trans) values obtained after normalizing the AIF and local VIF. Normalization of the input function resulted in smaller variation in PK parameters (KN(trans) vs. K(trans) for normal PZ tissue was 0.20±0.04mM.min(-1) vs. 0.87±0.54min(-1) for local VIF and 0.21±0.07mM.min(-1) vs. 0.25±0.29min(-1) for AIF) and better separation of the normal and tumor tissues (effect-size of this separation using KN(trans) vs. K(trans) was 0.89 vs. 0.75 for local VIF and 0.94 vs. 0.41 for AIF). The AC-ICA and AIF-based analyses provided similar (KN(trans)) values in normal PZ tissue of prostate across patients. Normalizing the input function before PK analysis significantly improved the reproducibility of the PK parameters and increased the separation between normal and tumor tissues. Using AC-ICA allows a local VIF to be estimated and the resulting PK parameters are similar to those obtained using a more conventional AIF; this may be valuable in studies where an artery is not available in the field of view.""","""['Hatef Mehrabian', 'Michael Da Rosa', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Anne L Martel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.', 'Calculation of intravascular signal in dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI using adaptive complex independent component analysis.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Imaging in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Impact of qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative analyses of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnet resonance imaging on prostate cancer detection.', 'Pyrolysis molecule of Torreya grandis bark for potential biomedicine.', 'Comparison of region-of-interest-averaged and pixel-averaged analysis of DCE-MRI data based on simulations and pre-clinical experiments.']"""

The advantages of robotic surgery could lead to improved continence outcomes in terms of early recovery compared with the traditional surgical methods.  Objective:   To describe the total anatomical reconstruction (TAR) technique during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Primary endpoint:   evaluation of the continence rate at different time points. Secondary endpoint: evaluation of urine leakage and anastomosis stenosis rates related to the technique.  Design, setting, and participants:   June, 2013 to November, 2014; prospective consecutive series of patients with localized prostate cancer (cT1-3, cN0, cM0).  Surgical procedure:   RARP with TAR was performed in all cases. Lymph node dissection was performed if the risk of lymph nodal metastasis was over 5%, according to the Briganti updated nomogram.  Measurements:   Preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and pathological variables were analyzed. Enrolled patients were arbitrarily divided into three groups according to a time criterion. The relationships between the learning curve and the trend of the above-mentioned variables were analyzed using LOESS analysis. Continence was rigorously analyzed preoperatively and at 24h, 1 wk, 4 wk, 12 wk, and 24 wk after catheter removal.  Results and limitations:   In total, 252 patients were analyzed. The continence rates immediately after catheter removal and at 1 wk, 4 wk, 12 wk, and 24 wk after RARP were 71.8%, 77.8%, 89.3%, 94.4%, and 98.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the nerve sparing technique, D'Amico risk groups, lymph node dissection, and prostate volume were involved in the early recovery of urinary continence. One ileal perforation requiring reoperation was recorded. The transfusion rate was 0.8%. Thirty-one (12.3%) postoperative complications were recorded up to 6 mo after surgery. Among these, eight acute urinary retentions (3.2%) and three urine leakages (1.2%) were recorded. There was a lack of randomization and comparison with other techniques. Both anatomical dissection of the prostatic apex and TAR were used. The results may not be generalized to low-volume centers.  Conclusions:   The TAR technique showed promising results in the early recovery of urinary continence, as well as watertight anastomosis and a low rate of urine leakage. The oncologic results were not affected. Comparative studies are needed to support the quality of reported results.  Patient summary:   On the basis of our findings, it seems that the risk of urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy can be lowered via meticulous anatomical reconstruction using a robotic system.

Recent studies of whole blood mRNA expression-based biomarkers strongly predicted survival but the genes used in these biomarker models were non-overlapping and their relationship was unknown. We developed a biomarker model for CRPC that is robust, but also captures underlying biological processes that drive prostate cancer lethality.  Methods:   Using three independent cohorts of CRPC patients, we developed an integrative genomic approach for understanding the biological processes underlying genes associated with cancer progression, constructed a novel four-gene model that captured these changes, and compared the performance of the new model with existing gene models and other clinical parameters.  Results:   Our analysis revealed striking patterns of myeloid- and lymphoid-specific distribution of genes that were differentially expressed in whole blood mRNA profiles: up-regulated genes in patients with worse survival were overexpressed in myeloid cells, whereas down-regulated genes were noted in lymphocytes. A resulting novel four-gene model showed significant prognostic power independent of known clinical predictors in two independent datasets totaling 90 patients with CRPC, and was superior to the two existing gene models.  Conclusions:   Whole blood mRNA profiling provides clinically relevant information in patients with CRPC. Integrative genomic analysis revealed patterns of differential mRNA expression with changes in gene expression in immune cell components which robustly predicted the survival of CRPC patients.

Mechanistically, we recently identified protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) 1 as a functional interactant of both the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human T prostanoid receptor (TP). The interaction with PRK1 was not only essential for TPα/TPβ-induced PCa cell migration but also enabled the TXA2-TP axis to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr11 (H3Thr11), an epigenetic marker both essential for and previously exclusively associated with androgen-induced chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activation. PRK1 is a member of a subfamily of three structurally related kinases comprising PRK1/PKNα, PRK2/PKNγ and PRK3/PKNβ that are widely yet differentially implicated in various cancers. Hence, focusing on the setting of prostate cancer, this study investigated whether TPα and/or TPβ might also complex with PRK2 and PRK3 to regulate their activity and neoplastic responses. While TPα and TPβ were found in immune complexes with PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 to regulate their activation and signalling, they do so differentially and in a TP agonist-regulated manner dependent on the T-loop activation status of the PRKs but independent of their kinase activity. Furthermore, TXA2-mediated neoplastic responses in prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells, including histone H3Thr11 phosphorylation, was found to occur through a PRK1- and PRK2-, but not PRK3-, dependent mechanism.

Furthermore, patients who had a high risk of developing arterial stiffness after ADT were investigated.  Results:   The whole cohort had no significant increase in arterial stiffness within 6 months after ADT, but 55.2 % of patients had an increased CAVI.

At baseline, HDL-C was lower and LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C were higher in the group with than without an increased CAVI after 6 months of ADT administration.  Conclusions:   Although the whole cohort did not show a significant change in arterial stiffness with ADT, some patients showed an increased arterial stiffness monitored with the CAVI.

Thus, clinicians might be able to monitor PCa patients who have a high risk of development of arterial stiffness after ADT administration by referring to LDL-C/HDL-C levels.""","""['Ryo Oka', 'Takanobu Utsumi', 'Takumi Endo', 'Masashi Yano', 'Shuichi Kamijima', 'Naoto Kamiya', 'Kohji Shirai', 'Hiroyoshi Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Analysis of the lipid profile and atherogenic risk during androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Toremifene improves lipid profiles in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: interim analysis of a multicenter phase III study.', 'Patients with prostate cancer treated by ADT have significantly higher fibrinogenemia than healthy control.', 'Lipid Status During Combined Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Metabolic effects of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Ticagrelor reduces doxorubicin-induced pyroptosis of rat cardiomyocytes by targeting GSK-3β/caspase-1.', 'Association between atherogenic lipids and GnRH agonists for prostate cancer in men with T2DM: a\xa0nationwide, population-based cohort study in Sweden.', ""Cancer therapy's impact on lipid metabolism: Mechanisms and future avenues."", 'Cardiovascular Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Metabolic Aspects of Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity.']"""

The purpose of this study is to determine the IRE effects in prostate tissue and correlate electrode configuration with the histology of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. We hypothesize that the area within the electrode configuration is completely ablated and that the area within the electrode configuration is predictive for the ablated area after treatment.  Methods:   A prospective phase I/II study was conducted in 16 consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer scheduled for RP. Focal or extended IRE treatment of the prostate was performed 4 weeks prior to RP. The locations of the electrodes were used to calculate the planned ablation zone. Following RP, the specimens were processed into whole-mount sections, histopathology (PA) was assessed and ablation zones were delineated. The area of the tissue alteration was determined by measuring the surface. The planned and the histological ablation zones were compared, analysed per individual patient and per protocol (focal vs. extended).  Results:   All cells within the electrode configuration were completely ablated and consisted only of necrotic and fibrotic tissue without leaving any viable cells. The histological ablation zone was always larger than the electrodes configuration (2.9 times larger for the 3 electrodes configuration and 2.5 times larger for the ≥4 electrode configuration). These ablation effects extended beyond the prostatic capsule in the neurovascular bundle in 13 out of 15 cases.  Conclusions:   IRE in prostate cancer results in completely ablated, sharply demarcated lesions with a histological ablation zone beyond the electrode configuration. No skip lesions were observed within the electrode configuration.

The programmable bio-nano-chip (p-BNC) system is a versatile multiplexed and multiclass chemical- and bio-sensing system for bioscience and clinical measurements. The system is comprised of two main components, a disposable cartridge and a portable analyzer. The customizable single-use plastic cartridges, which now can be manufactured in high volumes using injection molding, are designed for analytical performance, ease of use, reproducibility, and low cost. These labcard devices implement high surface area nano-structured biomarker capture elements that enable high performance signaling and are index-matched to real-world biological specimens. This detection modality, along with the convenience of on-chip fluid storage in blisters and self-contained waste, represents a standard process to digitize biological signatures at the point-of-care. A companion portable analyzer prototype has been developed to integrate fluid motivation, optical detection, and automated data analysis, and it serves as the human interface for complete assay automation. In this report, we provide a systems-level perspective of the p-BNC universal biosensing platform with an emphasis on flow control, device integration, and automation. To demonstrate the flexibility of the p-BNC, we distinguish diseased and non-case patients across three significant disease applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction.

Moreover, the intensity of surveillance strategies remains to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to determine the population-based intensity of surveillance strategy among patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who undergo watchful waiting/active surveillance and those who receive active treatment.  Methods:   Linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data were used to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 who were followed until December 31, 2009. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to quantify the use of prostate-specific antigen tests, office visits, and second prostate biopsies within 2 years of diagnosis.  Results:   Compared with patients who were receiving active treatment, those who were undergoing watchful waiting/active surveillance were less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and to attend office visits within the 2 years after diagnosis (P < .01). Of the 3656 patients who were undergoing watchful waiting/active surveillance, only 166 (4.5%) were on active surveillance (according to the authors' a priori definition), although the number increased over the last 2 years of the study (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.71; P < .01). Limitations of the study included data limited to men aged 65 years or older and the lack of ability to discern between watchful waiting and active surveillance.

Methods and results:   Among the 21 phenolics screened by an ELISA-binding assay, just urolithin C, urolithin D, and ellagic acid succeeded to inhibit the EphA2-ephrin-A1 binding. Urolithin D, the most active, was a competitive and reversible antagonist of EphA receptors able to discriminate between EphA and EphB receptors, showing intra-classes selectivity. Molecular modeling and structure-activity relationships shed light on the binding mode and selective activity of urolithin D. This catabolite blocked EphA2 phosphorylation mediated by ephrin-A1, while lacking cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effects, and was inactive on the EphA2 kinase assay.  Conclusion:   The mechanisms behind the cancer preventive properties of foods rich in flavan-3-ols and caffeoylquinic acids are not associated with metabolic pathways directly linked to the Eph-ephrin system. However, the ellagitannin-derived colonic metabolite urolithin D was able to exert remarkable and selective EphA-ephrin-A inhibition, which might impact on prostate cancer prevention.""","""['Carmine Giorgio', 'Pedro Mena', 'Daniele Del Rio', 'Furio Brighenti', 'Elisabetta Barocelli', 'Iftiin Hassan-Mohamed', 'Donatella Callegari', 'Alessio Lodola', 'Massimiliano Tognolini']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Urolithins: a Comprehensive Update on their Metabolism, Bioactivity, and Associated Gut Microbiota.', 'Perturbation of the EphA2-EphrinA1 system in human prostate cancer cells by colonic (poly)phenol catabolites.', 'Effects of pomegranate chemical constituents/intestinal microbial metabolites on CYP1B1 in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells.', 'Structure-activity relationships and mechanism of action of Eph-ephrin antagonists: interaction of cholanic acid with the EphA2 receptor.', 'The Therapeutic Relevance of Urolithins, Intestinal Metabolites of Ellagitannin-Rich Food: A Systematic Review of In Vivo Studies.', 'Small Molecule Compounds of Natural Origin Target Cellular Receptors to Inhibit Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Urolithins: a Comprehensive Update on their Metabolism, Bioactivity, and Associated Gut Microbiota.', 'Caffeoylquinic acids: chemistry, biosynthesis, occurrence, analytical challenges, and bioactivity.', 'Urolithins: The Gut Based Polyphenol Metabolites of Ellagitannins in Cancer Prevention, a Review.', 'Protective Effects of a Strawberry Ellagitannin-Rich Extract against Pro-Oxidative and Pro-Inflammatory Dysfunctions Induced by a High-Fat Diet in a Rat Model.']"""

In response to the success of this development, herein we present a dual-gene targeted siRNA and its delivery system, to achieve synergistic effects in cancer therapy. Two different sequences of siRNA were chemically modified to be randomly copolymerized in a single backbone of siRNA polymer (Dual-poly-siRNA), and the resulting Dual-poly-siRNA was incorporated into tumor-homing glycol chitosan nanoparticles. Based on the stability in serum and delivery in a tumor-targeted manner, intravenously administered Dual-poly-siRNA carrying glycol chitosan nanoparticles (Dual-NP) demonstrated successful dual-gene silencing in tumors.

Material and methods:   BS of mCRPC patients treated with BP was evaluated for pathologic tracer uptake of the jaws in BS suspicious for BRONJ. Results were compared to development of clinically evident BRONJ. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of BS for the detection of BRONJ as well as time from beginning of BP therapy to pathologic tracer uptake in BS and time from pathologic tracer uptake in BS to clinically evident BRONJ were determined.  Results:   Thirty BP-treated patients were included. Nine patients (30%) had pathologic BS lesions of the jaws. Six patients (20%) developed BRONJ. Sensitivity and specificity of BS for BRONJ prediction were 67 and 79%. Median time from the start of BP treatment to pathologic tracer uptake in BS was 28 months (range 10-33) and from pathologic tracer uptake in BS to clinically evident BRONJ 6.5 months (range 2-19). Pathologic tracer uptake in BS was significantly more often observed in patients who developed BRONJ compared to patients who did not (p = 0.049; OR 7.6).  Conclusions:   Patients with pathologic tracer uptake in the jaws in BS significantly more often develop BRONJ. An unsuspicious BS is predictive for absence of BRONJ in the future.

Materials and methods:   A total of 754 men who underwent radical prostatectomy and had an undetectable prostate specific antigen after surgery (less than 0.1 ng/ml) were studied. Prostate specific antigen was measured in banked serum specimens with an ultrasensitive assay (Hybritech® PSA, Beckman Coulter Access® 2) using a cutoff of 0.01 ng/ml. Prostate specific antigen was also measured in 44 men after cystoprostatectomy who had no pathological evidence of prostate cancer with the Hybritech assay and with the Quanterix AccuPSA™ assay.  Results:   Of the 754 men 17% (131) experienced biochemical recurrence (median 4.0 years). Those men without biochemical recurrence (83%, 623) had a minimum of 5 years of followup (median 11). Prostate specific antigen was less than 0.01 ng/ml in 93.4% of men with no biochemical recurrence, whereas 30.5% of men with biochemical recurrence had a prostate specific antigen of 0.01 ng/ml or greater. On multivariate analysis postoperative prostate specific antigen at a 0.01 ng/ml cutoff, pathological stage and Gleason score, and surgical margins were significant independent predictors of biochemical recurrence risk. Kaplan-Meier estimates for mean biochemical recurrence-free survival were 15.2 years (95% CI 14.9-15.6) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 10.0 years (95% CI 8.4-11.5) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). Biochemical recurrence-free rates 11 years after surgery were 86.1% (95% CI 83.2-89.0) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% (95% CI 37.5-60.3) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). Prostate specific antigen concentrations in 44 men after cystoprostatectomy were all less than 0.03 ng/ml, with 95.4% less than 0.01 ng/ml.  Conclusions:   In men with a serum prostate specific antigen less than 0.1 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy a tenfold lower cutoff (0.01 ng/ml) stratified biochemical recurrence-free survival and was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence, as were pathological features. Prostate specific antigen concentrations in men without pathological evidence of prostate cancer suggest that a higher prostate specific antigen concentration (0.03 ng/ml) in the ultrasensitive range may be needed to define the detection threshold.""","""['Lori J Sokoll', 'Zhen Zhang', 'Daniel W Chan', 'Adam C Reese', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Alan W Partin', 'Patrick C Walsh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Should Clinicians Use Ultrasensitive Prostate Specific Antigen Measurements for Patient Evaluation?', 'Reply by Authors.', 'Re: Do Ultrasensitive Prostate Specific Antigen Measurements Have a Role in Predicting Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Men after Radical Prostatectomy?: L.

In prostate cancer (PCa), the expression and functional role of CCL11 have not been intensively investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic or prognostic potential of Eotaxin-1 in PCa patients.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed serum from 140 patients who have undergone prostate biopsy due to elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as well as serum of 20 individuals with PSA levels < 1ng/ml (healthy control group). Moreover, 40 urine samples were analyzed. A custom-made Q-Plex array ELISA (Quansys Biosciences) for the detection of Eotaxin-1 was performed and Q-View Software used for quantification. In addition, clinical courses of patients documented in our Prostate Biobank database were analyzed. ROC and survival analyses were used to determine the diagnostic and prognostic power of Eotaxin-1 levels.  Results:   Serum Eotaxin-1 levels were significantly decreased in PCa (P = 0.006) as well as in benign prostate hyperplasia (P = 0.0006) compared to the control group. ROC analysis revealed that Eotaxin-1 is a significant marker to distinguish PCa from disease-free prostate. Moreover, we found that Eotaxin-1 expression is significantly decreased in Gleason score (GS) 6 (P = 0.0135) and GS 8 (P = 0.0057) patients compared to samples of healthy men, respectively. However, PCa aggressiveness was not predictable by Eotaxin-1 levels. In line with serum analyses, urine Eotaxin-1 was significantly decreased in patients with PCa compared to cancer-free individuals (P = 0.0185) but was not different between cancers of different GS. Patientś follow-up analyses showed no significant correlation between serum Eotaxin-1 levels and time to biochemical recurrence. Survival analyses also revealed no significant changes in progression-free survival among low (≤ 112.2 pg/ml) and high (> 112.2 pg/ml) Eotaxin-1 serum levels.  Conclusion:   Although this study has not established a prognostic role of Eotaxin-1 in PCa patients, this chemokine may serve as a diagnostic marker to distinguish between disease-free prostate and cancer.""","""['Isabel Heidegger', 'Julia Höfer', 'Markus Luger', 'Renate Pichler', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Eberhard Steiner', 'Stefan Jochberger', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Preoperative serum caveolin-1 as a prognostic marker for recurrence in a radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'CCL11 (eotaxin-1): a new diagnostic serum marker for prostate cancer.', 'A novel urinary long non-coding RNA transcript improves diagnostic accuracy in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Recent progress in urinary proteome analysis for prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Urinary microRNAs for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response: are we there yet?', 'Elevated serum eotaxin and IP-10 levels as potential biomarkers for the detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Urine protein biomarkers of bladder cancer arising from 16-plex antibody-based screens.', 'Asthma-related inflammation promotes lung metastasis of breast cancer cells through CCL11-CCR3 pathway.', 'Research status and progress of the RNA or protein biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying postoperative recurrence in prostate cancer by gene expression profiling.']"""

Previous cancer-related immigrant health studies identified differences in mortality and incidence between immigrants and Australian-born people. To identify groups that may require targeted interventions, we describe by region of birth: 1. the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates for NSW residents, Australia's most populous state; and 2. mortality to incidence ratios (MIR) for all cancers.  Methods:   Cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from NSW residents for 2004-2008 (averaged) by sex, region of birth and 10 year age groups. Age standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (per 100,000), using the world standard population. In the place of 5-year survival rates, we used age standardised MIRs (=M/I) as a simple proxy indicator of cancer survival.  Results:   All-cancer incidence only exceeded Australian born people (308.5) for New Zealand born (322). The highest reported incidence rates for cancers from all regions were prostate and breast cancers. All-cancer mortality exceeded Australian-born (105.3) in people born in Western Europe (110.9), Oceania (108.2) and UK and Ireland (106.4). For Australian-born residents, the MIR was 34 cancer deaths per 100 cases compared to residents from Central Europe at 38 deaths per 100 cases and lowest at 28 deaths per 100 cases for residents from Central and Southern Asia.  Conclusion:   Some disparities between Australian-born NSW residents and immigrants were identified in prostate, breast and lung cancer mortality rates. While on average most immigrant groups have similar cancer characteristics for the top cancers, areas for improvement to inform strategies to alleviate cancer disparities are required. This analysis suggests that NSW residents could benefit from specific prevention programmes on healthy eating and smoking cessation, especially people from Central Europe, UK and Ireland and Western Europe. Rising immigration rates encourage us to continue to address the areas indicated for improvement.""","""['Eleonora Feletto', 'Freddy Sitas']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Cancer incidence in New Zealand born residents of New South Wales.', 'Cancer incidence in migrants to New South Wales.', 'Incidence of breast and colorectal cancer among immigrants in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective cohort study from 2004-2014.', 'HIV/AIDS among African-born residents in the United States.', 'Cancer in Australia: Actual incidence data from 1982 to 2013 and mortality data from 1982 to 2014 with projections to 2017.', 'Country of birth and non-small cell lung cancer incidence, treatment, and outcomes in New South Wales, Australia: a population-based linkage study.', 'Cancer Incidence in Migrants in Australia: Patterns of Three Infection-Related Cancers.', 'Drug use disorder and risk of incident and fatal prostate cancer among Swedish men: a nationwide epidemiological study.', 'Latent infection screening and prevalence in cancer patients born outside of Australia: a universal versus risk-based approach?', 'Female breast cancer in New South Wales, Australia, by country of birth: implications for health-service delivery.']"""

Methods:   We conducted the miRNA microarray and realtime PCR analyses in both androgen-dependent (ADPC) and androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) tissues. We also explored the role of hsa-miR-146a-5p (miR-146a) in MSKCC prostate cancer clinical database. Moreover, the impact of miR-146a on prostate cancer cells apoptosis were detected by Hoechst staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Its target is predicted by DIANA LAB online database and the result was assumed by western blotting and luciferase assay.  Results:   We demonstrated that miR-146a was down-regulated in AIPC tissues and cell lines compared to that in the ADPC tissues. In MSKCC data re-analyses, we found that miR-146a was underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer tissues and those with Gleason score >8, moreover, low level of miR-146a represented a high biochemical relapse rate after radical prostatectomy. In the functional analyses, we transfected miR-146a mimics into CPRC cell lines and found miR-146a induced cells apoptosis. In mechanic analyses, we found that miR-146a inhibited the basal level of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression by targeting its 3'UTR and an inverse correlation of expression between miR-146a and ROCK1 was observed. Moreover, caspase 3 activity was stimulated by miR-146a overexpression.

Could good quality RNA from cells in urine be obtained from every donor for multimarker analysis? In addition, could urine donation be as simple as possible, a practical consideration for a lab test, without involving a prostate massage (as indicated for PCA3 testing), which precludes frequent collection; needing it done at a specific time of day (e.g., first or second urine); and requiring prompt processing of samples in clinics with limited molecular biology capability?  Methods:   Collected urine samples were pelleted, and the RNA isolated was processed for cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription to generate amplified sense aRNA. The resultant aRNA was rigorously analyzed for possible introduced changes. DMSO was used as a cell preservative for frozen storage of urine samples.  Results:   Good quality aRNA was obtained for over 100 samples collected at two different institutions. The process of RNA amplification removed co-isolated DNA in some samples, which did not affect RNA amplification. Amplification did not amplify genes that were absent and produce other expression alterations. The sense aRNA could be used to generate urinary transcriptomes specific to individual patients. No chaotropic agents for RNA preservation were added to the urine samples so that the supernatant could be used for analysis of secreted protein biomarkers. The time of donation was not important since patients were seen during the entire day. DMSO was an effective cell preservative for freezing urine.

Large retrospective cohorts exist with combined weight recorded that needs to be modified for retrospective analysis. Weights of prostates and SV were separately recorded in 172 consecutive prostatectomies. The average weight of SV and proportion of prostate weight from combined weight were calculated. The adjustment factors were then validated on databases of 2 other institutions. The average weight of bilateral SV was 6.4 g (range = 1-17.3 g). The prostate constituted on average 87% (range = 66% to 98%) of the total specimen weight. There was no correlation between patient age and prostate weight with SV weight. The best performing correction method was to subtract 6.4 g from total radical prostatectomy weight and to use this weight for PSAD calculation. The average weights of retrospective specimens weighed with SV were not significantly different between the 3 institutions. Using our data allowed calibration of the weights and PSAD between the cohorts weighed with and without SV. Thus, prostate weight in specimens including SV weight can be adjusted by subtracting 6.4 g, resulting in significant change of PSAD. Some institution-specific variations may exist, which could further increase the precision of retrospective analysis involving prostate weight and PSAD.

However, earlier reports reveal that PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors promote autophagy at the early stage as a survival mechanism that might affect its apoptotic potential. It is necessary to investigate whether BI-69A11 mediated apoptosis is associated with autophagy for enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. Here, we found that BI-69A11 induced autophagy at earlier time point through the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6kinase pathway. Dose-dependent and time-dependent conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, increased accumulation of LC3-GFP dots in cytoplasm and increase in other autophagic markers such as Beclin-1, firmly supported the fact that BI-69A11 induces autophagy. Atg5, Atg7 and Beclin-1 siRNA mediated genetic attenuation and pre-treatment with pharmacological inhibitor 3-MA and CQ diminished the autophagy and increased the propensity of cell death towards apoptosis. It was also suggested that BI-69A11 mediated interaction between Akt, HSP-90 and Beclin-1 maintained the fine balance between autophagy and apoptosis. Interaction between Beclin-1 and HSP90 is one of the prime causes of induction of autophagy. Here, we also generated a novel combination therapy by pretreatment with CQ that inhibited the autophagy and accelerated the apoptotic potential of BI-69A11. In summary; our findings suggest that induction of autophagy lead to the resistance of colon cancer towards BI-69A11 mediated apoptosis.""","""['Ipsita Pal', 'Sheetal Parida', 'B N Prashanth Kumar', 'Payel Banik', 'Kaushik Kumar Dey', 'Sandipan Chakraborty', 'Sujit K Bhutia', 'Mahitosh Mandal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['BI-69A11 enhances susceptibility of colon cancer cells to mda-7/IL-24-induced growth inhibition by targeting Akt.', 'Cooperative effect of BI-69A11 and celecoxib enhances radiosensitization by modulating DNA damage repair in colon carcinoma.', 'BI-69A11-mediated inhibition of AKT leads to effective regression of xenograft melanoma.', ""Enhancing perifosine's anticancer efficacy by preventing autophagy."", 'The Application of Embelin for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Autophagy is a double-edged sword in the therapy of colorectal cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy-related protein kinases for potential therapeutic purpose.', 'Autophagy, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and the Unfolded Protein Response in Intracerebral Hemorrhage.', 'Autophagy inhibition enhances RAD001-induced cytotoxicity in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Autophagy in 5-Fluorouracil Therapy in Gastrointestinal Cancer: Trends and Challenges.']"""

However, the optimal sequencing of these agents to maximize clinical benefit remains unclear. Recent data from the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE studies suggest that early use of docetaxel in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) significantly improves survival, but whether early compared with delayed use of chemotherapy also provides a survival advantage in mCRPC is unknown.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients treated at Johns Hopkins is reported. Patients included were treated with sequential docetaxel and abiraterone, in either order. The combined progression-free survival (combined PFS: PFS1 + PFS2) of abiraterone-to-docetaxel is compared to the reverse sequence, where PFS1 and PFS2 represent progression-free survival on the first and second agents respectively. Overall survival (OS) from the start of the first therapy to death is compared between groups. Baseline characteristics are reported prior to the start of the first agent in the sequence. Propensity score-weighted multivariable models and Kaplan-Meier analysis are used for evaluation of the primary and secondary outcomes.  Results:   Fifty-eight patients who began treatment for mCRPC between January 2011 (the year of abiraterone's FDA-approval) and February 2015 were identified: 26 were in the docetaxel-to-abiraterone group and 32 were in the abiraterone-to-docetaxel group. Patients in the abiraterone-to-docetaxel group had more Gleason 8-10 tumors, greater metastatic burden in bone, and higher median PSAs than those in the docetaxel-to-abiraterone group. Propensity score-weighted univariate analyses for combined PFS (HR 0.82; 95%CI 0.50-1.33; P = 0.41) and OS (HR 0.79; 95%CI 0.50-1.25; P = 0.31) do not identify any significant differences based on treatment sequence. Propensity score-weighted multivariate analyses for combined PFS (HR 0.91; 95%CI 0.52-1.60; P = 0.74) and OS (HR 0.98; 95%CI 0.59-1.63; P = 0.95) also do not identify any significant differences between groups.  Conclusions:   We do not observe differences in clinical outcomes based on alternative sequencing of abiraterone and docetaxel in men with mCRPC. Treatment sequencing should be determined by patient and disease characteristics, comorbidities and end-organ function, ability to tolerate side effects, and patient preferences.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 20 222 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for PCa at the Mayo Clinic between 1987 and 2012. Disease recurrence was defined as follow-up PSA >0.4 ng/mL or biopsy-proven local recurrence. Systemic progression was defined as development of metastatic disease on imaging. Comparisons of baseline characteristics between pT0 and non-pT0 groups were carried out using chi-squared tests. Recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.  Results:   A total of 62 patients (0.3%) had pT0 disease according to the RP specimen. In univariable analysis, pT0 disease was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.045), lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA; P = 0.002), lower clinical stage (P < 0.001), lower biopsy Gleason score (P = 0.042), and receipt of preoperative transurethral resection, hormonal and radiation therapies (all P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, lower PSA levels, lower Gleason score, and receipt of preoperative treatment were independently associated with pT0 (all P < 0.05). Seven patients (11%) with pT0 PCa developed disease recurrence over a median follow-up of 10.9 years. All seven patients had preoperative treatment(s) and three had recurrence with a PSA doubling time of <9 months. Compared with non-pT0 disease, pT0 disease was associated with longer recurrence-free survival (P < 0.05). Only one (1.6%) patient with pT0 disease developed systemic progression.  Conclusions:   pT0 stage PCa is a rare phenomenon and is associated with receipt of preoperative treatment and features of low-risk PCa. Although pT0 has a very favourable prognosis, some men, especially those who received preoperative treatment, experience a small but non-negligible risk of disease recurrence and systemic progression.""","""['Daniel M Moreira', 'Boris Gershman', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Robert Houston Thompson', 'Igor Frank', 'Matthew K Tollefson', 'Matthew T Gettman', 'Robert Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Nondetectable Prostate Carcinoma (pT0) after Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Can pT0 stage of prostate cancer be predicted before radical prostatectomy?', 'Long-term oncological outcomes of men undergoing radical prostatectomy with preoperative prostate-specific antigen <2.5 ng/ml and 2.5-4 ng/ml.', 'DNA comparison between operative and biopsy specimens to investigate stage pT0 after radical prostatectomy.', 'Nondetectable Prostate Carcinoma (pT0) after Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.']"""

Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively). The associations of NSAID use with ED risk were attenuated after controlling for indications for NSAID use.

These structural alterations lead to the differential recruitment of coregulators (coactivators or corepressors) that control the expression of NR-regulated genes. Here, we show that a stretch of proline residues located within the N-terminus of androgen receptor (AR) is a bona fide coregulator binding surface, the disruption of which reduces the androgen-dependent proliferation and migration of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Using T7 phage display, we identified a novel AR-interacting protein, Src homology 3 (SH3)-domain containing, Ysc84-like 1 (SH3YL1), whose interaction with the receptor is dependent upon this polyproline domain. As with mutations within the AR polyproline domain, knockdown of SH3YL1 attenuated androgen-mediated cell growth and migration. RNA expression analysis revealed that SH3YL1 was required for the induction of a subset of AR-modulated genes. Notable was the observation that ubinuclein 1 (UBN1), a key member of a histone H3.3 chaperone complex, was a transcriptional target of the AR/SH3YL1 complex, correlated with aggressive PCa in patients, and was necessary for the maximal androgen-mediated proliferation and migration of PCa cells.

Here we propose a multi-step method for constructing lncRNA-lncRNA functional synergistic networks (LFSNs) through co-regulation of functional modules having three features: common coexpressed genes of lncRNA pairs, enrichment in the same functional category and close proximity within protein interaction networks. Applied to three cancers, we constructed cancer-specific LFSNs and found that they exhibit a scale free and modular architecture. In addition, cancer-associated lncRNAs tend to be hubs and are enriched within modules. Although there is little synergistic pairing of lncRNAs across cancers, lncRNA pairs involved in the same cancer hallmarks by regulating same or different biological processes. Finally, we identify prognostic biomarkers within cancer lncRNA expression datasets using modules derived from LFSNs. In summary, this proof-of-principle study indicates synergistic lncRNA pairs can be identified through integrative analysis of genome-wide expression data sets and functional information.""","""['Yongsheng Li', 'Juan Chen', 'Jinwen Zhang', 'Zishan Wang', 'Tingting Shao', 'Chunjie Jiang', 'Juan Xu', 'Xia Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['LncRNA ontology: inferring lncRNA functions based on chromatin states and expression patterns.', 'Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of differential expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs and identification of a 14-lncRNA prognostic signature for patients with colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Inferring and analyzing module-specific lncRNA-mRNA causal regulatory networks in human cancer.', 'Methods to Study Long Noncoding RNA Biology in Cancer.', 'Surveying lncRNA-lncRNA cooperations reveals dominant effect on tumor immunity cross cancers.', 'Identification of novel key regulatory lncRNAs in gastric adenocarcinoma.', 'Non-Coding RNAs Are Brokers in Breast Cancer Interactome Networks and Add Discrimination Power between Subtypes.', 'LncRNA-MIAT promotes thyroid cancer progression and function as ceRNA to target EZH2 by sponging miR-150-5p.', 'Distinct Extracellular RNA Profiles in Different Plasma Components.']"""

Patients and methods:   Demographic, socio-economic and tumour characteristics of men with prostate cancer and men with other solid malignancies were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (1988-2010). Poisson regression models were fitted to compare the incidence of suicidal and accidental deaths in prostate cancer vs other solid cancers. Multivariate Cox regression was used to determine if receipt of definitive primary treatment impacted the risk of suicide or accidental death in men with localised/regional prostate cancer.  Results:   Risk of suicidal and accidental death was significantly lower in men with prostate cancer (1 165 [0.2%] and 3 199 [0.6%]) than men with other cancers (2 232 [0.2%] and 4 501 [0.5%], respectively), except within the first year of diagnosis (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.02-5.23 and ARR 4.22, 95% CI 3.24-5.51, respectively, 0-3 months after diagnosis).

Absence of data about previous co-morbidities and drug addictions in the SEER dataset was an important limitation.

Recently, disruption of the circadian system has been proposed to affect risk, as it entails an inhibited melatonin production, and melatonin has demonstrated beneficial effects on cancer inhibition. This suggests a potential role of traffic noise in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Road traffic and railway noise was calculated for all present and historical addresses from 1987-2010 for a cohort of 24,473 middle-aged, Danish men. During follow-up, 1,457 prostate cancer cases were identified. We used Cox Proportional Hazards Models to calculate the association between noise exposure and incident prostate cancer. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) were calculated as crude and adjusted for smoking status, education, socioeconomic position, BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, calendar year, and traffic noise from other sources than the one investigated.  Results:   There was no association between residential road traffic noise and risk of prostate cancer for any of the three exposure windows: 1, 5 or 10-year mean noise exposure before prostate cancer diagnosis. This result persisted when stratifying cases by aggressiveness. For railway noise, there was no association with overall prostate cancer. There was no statistically significant effect modification by age, education, smoking status, waist circumference or railway noise, on the association between road traffic noise and prostate cancer, although there seemed to be a suggestion of an association among never smokers (IRR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00-1.36).

We evaluated completeness and quality of informed decision making in localized prostate cancer post biopsy encounters.  Methods:   We analyzed audio-recorded office visits of 252 men with presumed localized prostate cancer (Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 scores) who were seeing 45 physicians at 4 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Data were collected between September 2008 and May 2012 in a trial of 2 decision aids (DAs). Braddock's previously validated Informed Decision Making (IDM) system was used to measure quality. Latent variable models for ordinal data examined the relationship of IDM score to treatment received.  Results:   Mean IDM score showed modest quality (7.61±2.45 out of 18) and high variability. Treatment choice and risks and benefits were discussed in approximately 95% of encounters. However, in more than one-third of encounters, physicians provided a partial set of treatment options and omitted surveillance as a choice. Informing quality was greater in patients treated with surveillance (β = 1.1, p = .04). Gleason score (7 vs 6) and lower age were often cited as reasons to exclude surveillance. Patient preferences were elicited in the majority of cases, but not used to guide treatment planning. Encounter time was modestly correlated with IDM score (r = 0.237, p = .01). DA type was not associated with IDM score.  Discussion:   Physicians informed patients of options and risks and benefits, but infrequently engaged patients in core shared decision-making processes. Despite patients having received DAs, physicians rarely provided an opportunity for preference-driven decision making. More attention to the underused patient decision-making and engagement elements could result in improved shared decision making.""","""['Margaret Holmes-Rovner', 'Jeffrey S Montgomery', 'David R Rovner', 'Laura D Scherer', 'Jesse Whitfield', 'Valerie C Kahn', 'Edgar C Merkle', 'Peter A Ubel', 'Angela Fagerlin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Physician Recommendations Trump Patient Preferences in Prostate Cancer Treatment Decisions.', 'Decision aid use during post-biopsy consultations for localized prostate cancer.', 'Measuring informed decision making about prostate cancer screening in primary care.', 'Informed decision making: what is its role in cancer screening?', 'Communication preferences of patients with prostate cancer : Preferences regarding the communication of bad news of patients with prostate cancer in Germany-results of an anonymous patient survey.', 'Digitalizing the Clinical Research Informed Consent Process: Assessing the Participant Experience in Comparison With Traditional Paper-Based Methods.', 'Informed Decision Making for Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation.', 'Will Any Road Get You There?

Materials and methods:   Thirty-eight patients with clinically important peripheral PCa (≥0.5 cc) were retrospectively studied. These patients underwent 1.5T multiparametric prostate MR with PCa and benign regions of interest (ROIs) selected using a visual registration with morphometric reconstruction obtained from radical prostatectomy. Using three pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis software programs, the mean K(trans) of ROIs was computed using three AIFs: an individual AIF (Ind-AIF) and two literature population average AIFs of Weinmann (W-AIF) and of Fritz-Hansen (FH-AIF). A pairwise comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCC) obtained with different AIFs was performed.

Cancer stem-like cells are shown to be highly tumorigenic, pro-angiogenic and can significantly contribute to tumor new vessel formation and bone marrow derived-EPCs (BM-EPCs) are shown to recruit to the angiogenic switch in tumor growth and metastatic progression, suggesting the importance of targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) and EPCs for novel tumor therapies. Pristimerin, an active component isolated from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae, has shown anti-tumor effects in some cell lines in previous studies. However, the effect and mechanism of Pristimerin on CSCs and EPCs in PCa bone metastasis are not well studied.  Methods:   The effect of Pristimerin on PC-3 stem cell characteristics and metastasis were detected by spheroid formation, CD133 and CD44 protein expression, matrix-gel invasive assay and colony-formation assay in vitro, VEGF and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression by ELISA assay, and tumor tumorigenicity by X-ray and MR in NOD-SCID mice model in vivo. In addition, we also detected the effect of Pristimerin on VEGF-induced vasculogenesis and protein expression of BM-EPCs.  Results:   Pristimerin could significantly inhibit spheroid formation and protein expression of CD133 and CD44, reduce VEGF and pro-inflammation cytokines expression of PC-3 cell, and prevent the xenografted PC-3 tumor growth in the bone of nude mice. The present data also showed that Pristimerin significantly inhibited VEGF-induced vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs by suppressing the EPCs functions including proliferation, adhesion, migration, tube formation and inactivation the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Akt and eNOS.

To see whether such drugs could be used at lower concentrations with the same efficacy, it was first shown that microvesiculation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, PC3, could be inhibited pharmacologically with calpeptin (calpain inhibitor) and by siRNA (CAPNS1). In cells treated with docetaxel (DTX), this inhibition resulted in a third-fold increase in intracellular concentrations of DTX. As a result, 20-fold lower concentrations of DTX (5 nM) could be used, in the presence of calpeptin (20 μM) inducing the same degree of apoptosis after 48 h in PC3 cells, as 100 nM of DTX alone. Inhibition of microvesiculation similarly improved combination chemotherapy (DTX and methotrexate). In a mouse xenograft model of PCa, DTX (0.1 mg/kg) together with calpeptin (10 mg/kg), administered i.p., significantly reduced tumor volumes compared to DTX alone (0.1 mg/kg) and brought about the same reductions in tumor growth as 10 mg/kg of DTX alone.

However, whether aberrant expression of NEK2 is associated with outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) patients remains to be determined.  Methods:   Expression of NEK2 in human PCa cells and primary PCa tissues was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of NEK2 in human PCa cells was depleted with siRNA. Effects of the depletion on cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenicity were assessed both in vitro with cell cultures and in vivo with subcutaneous implantation of xenografts. In silico analyses of the online Taylor dataset were carried out to determine whether the expression level of NEK2 correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer.  Results:   Compared with benign human prostatic epithelial cells and tissues, the expression of NEK2 was elevated in human PCa cells and primary PCa tissues. Depleting NEK2 expression inhibited human PCa cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo.

In the first mathematical model of intermittent androgen suppression (Ideta et al., 2008), the authors tried to control the trajectory of the model to a periodic orbit to enable patients to coexist with prostate cancer, even if it cannot be eradicated. Recently, we proposed a mathematical model capable of improving the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of prostate cancer under intermittent androgen suppression (Hirata et al., 2010a). Here we examine whether such a stable periodic orbit can be created for patients who eventually will have to experience the relapse of cancer at a later stage. By using a mathematical analysis, we found that the above model of Hirata et al. does not contain a non-zero periodic orbit that can be targeted for such patients, namely patients of type (ii) or type (iii) for whom intermittent androgen suppression cannot stabilize the origin where no cancer cells exist. This result might suggest that the patients must seek to delay the relapse as much as possible if the cancer cannot be eradicated.

Tumor growth was compared in vaccinated and control groups. We found that VLPV-PSA could infect mouse dendritic cells in vitro and induce a robust PSA-specific immune response in vivo. A substantial proportion of splenic CD8 T cells (19.6 ± 7.4%) produced IFNγ in response to the immunodominant peptide PSA(65-73). In the blood of vaccinated mice, 18.4 ± 4.1% of CD8 T cells were PSA-specific as determined by the staining with H-2D(b)/PSA(65-73) dextramers. VLPV-PSA vaccination also strongly stimulated production of IgG2a/b anti-PSA antibodies. Tumors in vaccinated mice showed low levels of PSA expression and significant CD8+ T cell infiltration.

Methods:   This case-control study comprised a total number of 241 subjects, including 102 patients with PCa and 139 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

There were no significant differences in genotype frequencies between patients with low and high degrees of PCa (p = 0.4). Therefore, this polymorphism cannot be considered as a protective factor for PCa metastasis. It seems that MMP2 polymorphism has no protective effect on the grading of the tumor (p = 0.8). Our results indicated that MMP2 polymorphism had no role in the vascular invasion of PCa.

We hypothesize that VM are less likely to receive age-appropriate PSAS compared with NVM.  Materials and methods:   We identified VM and NVM aged 55 to 69 years without history of prostate cancer who underwent PSA testing in the year preceding that of the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System survey. The prevalence of PSAS among VM and NVM was determined in aggregate and on a state-by-state basis. Complex samples logistic regression models calculated the odds of PSAS based on veteran status, adjusted for patient/demographic characteristics.  Results:   In all, 56,962 responses were collected, yielding a weighted estimate of 23.7 million men, of which 30.5% were VM. Overall, 45.2% (CI: 43.9%-46.5%) of VM reported PSAS compared with only 37.5% (CI: 36.5%-38.5%) of NVM. VM were more likely to have health insurance (92.0%; CI: 91.3%-92.8% vs. 86.2%; CI: 85.4%-87.0%) and a regular health care provider (89.0%; CI: 88.2%-89.8% vs. 85.9%; CI: 85.1%-86.6%) compared with NVM. Unadjusted prevalence of PSAS varied widely across the United States for VM and NVM. In multivariable analyses, VM had higher odds for PSAS (odds ratio = 1.10, CI: 1.02%-1.18%).  Conclusions:   Contrary to our initial hypothesis, our findings suggest a continued pattern of greater preventive health services use by veterans. VM were more likely to undergo PSAS than NVM. This is, in part, attributable to better access to primary care and health insurance.

Methods:   We conducted a cross-cancer genomic analysis for the inflammation pathway based on 48 genome-wide association studies within the National Cancer Institute GAME-ON Network across five common cancer sites, with a total of 64 591 cancer patients and 74 467 control patients. Subset-based meta-analysis was used to account for possible disease heterogeneity, and hierarchical modeling was employed to estimate the effect of the subcomponents within the inflammation pathway. The network was visualized by enrichment map. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We identified three pleiotropic loci within the inflammation pathway, including one novel locus in Ch12q24 encoding SH2B3 (rs3184504), which reached GWAS significance with a P value of 1.78 x 10(-8), and it showed an association with lung cancer (P = 2.01 x 10(-6)), colorectal cancer (GECCO P = 6.72x10(-6); CORECT P = 3.32x10(-5)), and breast cancer (P = .009). We also identified five key subpathway components with genetic variants that are relevant for the risk of these five cancer sites: inflammatory response for colorectal cancer (P = .006), inflammation related cell cycle gene for lung cancer (P = 1.35x10(-6)), and activation of immune response for ovarian cancer (P = .009). In addition, sequence variations in immune system development played a role in breast cancer etiology (P = .001) and innate immune response was involved in the risk of both colorectal (P = .022) and ovarian cancer (P = .003).  Conclusions:   Genetic variations in inflammation and its related subpathway components are keys to the development of lung, colorectal, ovary, and breast cancer, including SH2B3, which is associated with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer.""","""['Rayjean J Hung', 'Cornelia M Ulrich', 'Ellen L Goode', 'Yonathan Brhane', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Andrew T Chan', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Joellen Schildkraut', 'John S Witte', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Paolo Boffetta', 'Margaret R Spitz', 'Julia G Poirier', 'David N Rider', 'Brooke L Fridley', 'Zhihua Chen', 'Christopher Haiman', 'Fredrick Schumacher', 'Douglas F Easton', 'Maria Teresa Landi', 'Paul Brennan', 'Richard Houlston', 'David C Christiani', 'John K Field', 'Heike Bickeböller', 'Angela Risch', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Stephen Chanock', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Peter Kraft', 'Sara Lindström', 'Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Honglin Song', 'Catherine Phelan', 'Nicholas Wentzensen', 'Ulrike Peters', 'Martha L Slattery;GECCO;Thomas A Sellers;FOCI;Graham Casey', 'Stephen B Gruber;CORECT;David J Hunter;DRIVE;Christopher I Amos', 'Brian Henderson;GAME-ON Network']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['A Cross-Cancer Genetic Association Analysis of the DNA Repair and DNA Damage Signaling Pathways for Lung, Ovary, Prostate, Breast, and Colorectal Cancer.', 'Cross-Cancer Genome-Wide Analysis of Lung, Ovary, Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Reveals Novel Pleiotropic Associations.', 'Shared heritability and functional enrichment across six solid cancers.', 'Genetic variation of insulin-like growth factor binging proteins and tumorigenesis.', 'Genetic and familial factors influencing breast, colon, prostate and lung cancers.', 'Prognostic value of preoperative hematological markers in patients with glioblastoma multiforme and construction of random survival forest model.', 'Beneficial insights into postbiotics against colorectal cancer.', 'Cross-cancer pleiotropic analysis identifies three novel genetic risk loci for colorectal cancer.', 'CFDP1 is a neuroblastoma susceptibility gene that regulates transcription factors of the noradrenergic cell identity.', 'Inflammation, microbiome and colorectal cancer disparity in African-Americans: Are there bugs in the genetics?']"""

A thiolated DNA aptamer with established affinity for prostate specific antigen (PSA) was complexed with PSA prior to being immobilised on the surface of a gold electrode. Controlled electropolymerisation of dopamine around the complex served to both entrap the complex, holding the aptamer in, or near to, it's binding conformation, and to localise the PSA binding sites at the sensor surface. Following removal of PSA, it was proposed that the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) cavity would act synergistically with the embedded aptamer to form a hybrid receptor (apta-MIP), displaying recognition properties superior to that of aptamer alone. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate subsequent rebinding of PSA to the apta-MIP surface. The apta-MIP sensor showed high sensitivity with a linear response from 100pg/ml to 100ng/ml of PSA and a limit of detection of 1pg/ml, which was three-fold higher than aptamer alone sensor for PSA. Furthermore, the sensor demonstrated low cross-reactivity with a homologous protein (human Kallikrein 2) and low response to human serum albumin (HSA), suggesting possible resilience to the non-specific binding of serum proteins.""","""['Pawan Jolly', 'Vibha Tamboli', 'Robert L Harniman', 'Pedro Estrela', 'Chris J Allender', 'Jenna L Bowen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Molecularly Imprinting-Aptamer Techniques and Their Applications in Molecular Recognition.', 'A molecularly imprinted electrochemical nanobiosensor for prostate specific antigen determination.', 'Sensitive and selective ""signal-off"" electrochemiluminescence sensing of prostate-specific antigen based on an aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer.', 'Hybrid Synthetic Receptors on MOSFET Devices for Detection of Prostate Specific Antigen in Human Plasma.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'In situ synthesis and dynamic simulation of molecularly imprinted polymeric nanoparticles on a micro-reactor system.', 'Highly Selective Aptamer-Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hybrids for Recognition of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variants.', 'Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for the Determination of Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Sensors Based on the Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors for Chemical and Biological Analyses.', 'Molecularly Imprinting-Aptamer Techniques and Their Applications in Molecular Recognition.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study included 1084 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with conventional radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), permanent iodine-125 implantation (PI) alone, and PI combined with external beam radiotherapy (PI+EBRT). The effects of treatment- and patient-related factors on late grade ⩾ 2 (G2+) GU/GI toxicity risk were assessed.  Results:   The median follow-up was 43 months (range, 12-97 months). Compared to the PI+EBRT, there was significantly less G2+ GU toxicity in the conventional radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.77) and the IMRT (HR=0.45, 95% CI, 0.27-0.73).

Our aim was to perform image-based absorbed dose calculation for the new PSMA ligand (177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in support of its use for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Whole-body planar images and SPECT/CT images of the abdomen were acquired in five patients (mean age 68 years) for during two treatment cycles at approximately 1, 24, 48 and 72 h after administration of 3.6 GBq (range 3.4 to 3.9 GBq) (177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Quantitative 3D SPECT OSEM reconstruction was performed with corrections for photon scatter, photon attenuation and detector blurring. A camera-specific calibration factor derived from phantom measurements was used for quantitation. Absorbed doses were calculated for various organs from the images using a combination of linear approximation, exponential fit, and target-specific S values, in accordance with the MIRD scheme. Absorbed doses to bone marrow were estimated from planar and SPECT images and with consideration of the blood sampling method according to the EANM guidelines.  Results:   The average (± SD) absorbed doses per cycle were 2.2 ± 0.6 Gy for the kidneys (0.6 Gy/GBq), 5.1 ± 1.8 Gy for the salivary glands (1.4 Gy/GBq), 0.4 ± 0.2 Gy for the liver (0.1 Gy/GBq), 0.4 ± 0.1 Gy for the spleen (0.1 Gy/GBq), and 44 ± 19 mGy for the bone marrow (0.012 Gy/GBq). The organ absorbed doses did not differ significantly between cycles. The critical absorbed dose reported for the kidneys (23 Gy) was not reached in any patient. At 24 h there was increased uptake in the colon with 50 - 70 % overlap to the kidneys on planar images. Absorbed doses for tumour lesions ranged between 1.2 and 47.5 Gy (13.1 Gy/GBq) per cycle.  Conclusion:   The salivary glands and kidneys showed high, but not critical, absorbed doses after RLT with (177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617. We suggest that (177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 is suitable for radiotherapy, offering tumour-to-kidney ratios comparable to those with RLT agents currently available for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours.

Although the importance of dietary stilbenes such as resveratrol and pterostilbene as anti-cancer agents is well recognized, our understanding of their miRNA-targeting capabilities is still limited. In our previous study, we reported that resveratrol downregulates PTEN-targeting members of the oncogenic miR-17 family, which are overexpressed in prostate cancer. This study investigates the resveratrol and pterostilbene induced miRNA-mediated regulation of PTEN in prostate cancer. Here, we show that both compounds decrease the levels of endogenous as well as exogenously expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b thereby upregulating their target PTEN. Using functional luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that ectopically expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b directly target PTEN 3'UTR to reduce its expression, an effect rescued upon treatment with resveratrol and pterostilbene.

In the present study, we created txr ovarian carcinoma cell lines to identify the genes involved in chemoresistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed 1,194 overexpressed genes in txr cells. Among the upregulated genes, more than 12 cryptic transcription factors were identified using MetaCore analysis (including AR, C/EBPβ, ERα, HNF4α, c-Jun/AP-1, c-Myc, and SP-1). Notably, individual silencing of these transcription factors (except HNF4`)sensitized txr cells to taxol. The androgen receptor (AR) and its target genes were selected for further analysis. Silencing AR using RNA interference produced a 3-fold sensitization to taxol in txr cells, a response similar to that produced by silencing abcb1. AR silencing also downregulated the expression of prominent txr gene candidates (including abcb1, abcb6, abcg2, bmp5, fat3, fgfr2, h1f0, srcrb4d, and tmprss15). In contrast, AR activation using the agonist DHT upregulated expression of the target genes. Individually silencing seven out of nine (78%) AR-regulated txr genes sensitized txr cells to taxol. Inhibition of AKT and JNK cellular kinases using chemical inhibitors caused a dramatic suppression of AR expression.

In this study, we intercalated Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea, into Ca/Al-NO3 Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles, and evaluated its efficacy compared to EGCG alone on PC3 cell line. The EGCG loaded LDH nanohybrids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanosizer analyses. The anticancer activity of the EGCG-loaded LDH was investigated in prostate cancer cell line (PC3) while the release behavior of EGCG from LDH was observed at pH 7.45 and 4.25. Besides enhancing of apoptotic activity of EGCG, the results showed that intercalation of EGCG into LDH can improve the anti- tumor activity of EGCG over 5-fold dose advantages in in-vitro system. Subsequently, the in-vitro release data showed that EGCG-loaded LDH had longer release duration compared to physical mixture, and the mechanism of diffusion through the particle was rate-limiting step. Acidic attack was responsible for faster release of EGCG molecules from LDH at pH of 4.25 compared to pH of 7.4.

This study has analysed the changes in histone H1 upon modification by methylglyoxal (MG) and its implications in auto-immunopathogenesis of cancer. Modified histone showed modifications in the aromatic residues, changed tyrosine microenvironment, intermolecular cross linking and generation of AGEs. It showed masking of hydrophobic patches and a hypsochromic shift in the in ANS specific fluorescence. MG aggressively oxidized histone H1 leading to the accumulation of reactive carbonyls. Far UV CD measurements showed di-carbonyl induced enhancement of the alpha structure and the induction of beta sheet conformation; and thermal denaturation (Tm) studies confirmed the thermal stability of the modified histone. FTIR analysis showed amide I band shift, generation of a carboxyethyl group and N-Cα vibrations in the modified histone. LCMS analysis confirmed the formation of Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine and electron microscopic studies revealed the amorphous aggregate formation. The modified histone showed altered cooperative binding with DNA. Modified H1 induced high titre antibodies in rabbits and the IgG isolated form sera of rabbits immunized with modified H1 exhibited specific binding with its immunogen in Western Blot analysis. IgG isolated from the sera of patients with lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and cancer of head and neck region showed better recognition for neo-epitopes on the modified histone, reflecting the presence of circulating autoantibodies in cancer.

As a modulation index considering only mechanical uncertainty of VMAT, MIt has been previously suggested. In this study, we developed a weighting factor which represents dose calculation uncertainty based on the aperture shapes of fluence maps at every control point of VMAT plans. In order to calculate the weighting factor, the thinning algorithm of image processing techniques was applied to measure field aperture irregularity. By combining this weighting factor with the previously suggested modulation index, MIt, comprehensive modulation index (MIc) was designed. To evaluate the performance of MIc, gamma passing rates, differences in mechanical parameters between plans and log files and differences in dose-volume parameters between plans and the plans reconstructed from log files were acquired with a total of 52 VMAT plans. Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) between the values of MIc and measures of VMAT delivery accuracy were calculated. The rs values of MIc (f = 0.5) to global gamma passing rates with 2%/2 mm, 1%/2 mm and 2%/1 mm were -0.728,-0.847 and -0.617, respectively (p < 0.001).

Cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics were studied in Abcb1a/1b, Abcg2, Abcc2, Cyp3a, and combination knockout mice. We found that human ABCB1, but not ABCG2, transported cabazitaxel in vitro. Upon oral cabazitaxel administration, total plasma levels were greatly increased due to binding to plasma carboxylesterase Ces1c, which is highly upregulated in several knockout strains. Ces1c inhibition and in vivo hepatic Ces1c knockdown reversed these effects. Correcting for Ces1c effects, Abcb1a/1b, Abcg2, and Abcc2 did not restrict cabazitaxel oral availability, whereas Abcb1a/1b, but not Abcg2, dramatically reduced cabazitaxel brain accumulation (>10-fold). Coadministration of the ABCB1 inhibitor elacridar completely reversed this brain accumulation effect. After correction for Ces1c effects, Cyp3a knockout mice demonstrated a strong (six-fold) increase in cabazitaxel oral availability, which was completely reversed by transgenic human CYP3A4 in intestine and liver. Cabazitaxel markedly inhibited mouse Ces1c, but human CES1 and CES2 only weakly. Ces1c upregulation can thus complicate preclinical cabazitaxel studies. In summary, ABCB1 limits cabazitaxel brain accumulation and therefore potentially therapeutic efficacy against (micro)metastases or primary tumors positioned wholly or partly behind a functional blood-brain barrier. This can be reversed with elacridar coadministration, and similar effects may apply to ABCB1-expressing tumors. CYP3A4 profoundly reduces the oral availability of cabazitaxel.

Other sites of nonspecific tracer uptake were pulmonary hila (n = 20), inguinal lymph nodes (n = 15), and axillary lymph nodes (n = 10). Mean SUV values for mediastinal lymph nodes, pulmonary hila, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were 4.8, 4.3, 3.1 and 4.1, respectively. Mean SUV value of nonspecific sites of tracer accumulation was lower (not significantly; (p = 0.2) than tracer uptake values measured in metastases sites (bone metastases mean SUVmax value - 13.2, metastatic lymph nodes mean SUVmax value - 9.2).  Conclusions:   ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT is a valuable and an established functional diagnostic imaging method for staging and restaging prostate cancer. However, nonspecific uptake of the tracer can often be seen in lymph nodes not related to primary disease. Patient history, clinical examination, laboratory tests and correlation with other imaging methods, must be taken into consideration when interpreting ¹⁸F-choline PET/CT findings.""","""['Anja Tea Golubić', 'Andrea Mutvar', 'Marijan Žuvić', 'Dražen Huić']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur""","""['Mediastinal lymph node uptake in patients with prostate carcinoma on F18-choline PET/CT.', '18F-fluorocholine positron-emission/computed tomography for lymph node staging of patients with prostate cancer: preliminary results of a prospective study.', 'Dual-phase PET-CT to differentiate 18FFluoromethylcholine uptake in reactive and malignant lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Furosemide diminishes ¹⁸F-fluoroethylcholine uptake in prostate cancer in vivo.', '18FFluoroethylcholine.', 'Effect of positive carbon-11-choline PET/CT results in the therapeutic management of prostate cancer biochemical relapse.', 'About the specificity of radiotracers for prostate cancer.']"""

We performed a series of analytic validation studies to evaluate the performance of the automated bone scan index (BSI) as an imaging biomarker in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Three separate analytic studies were performed to evaluate the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the automated BSI. Simulation study: bone scan simulations with predefined tumor burdens were created to assess accuracy and precision. Fifty bone scans were simulated with a tumor burden ranging from low to high disease confluence (0.10-13.0 BSI). A second group of 50 scans was divided into 5 subgroups, each containing 10 simulated bone scans, corresponding to BSI values of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10.0. Repeat bone scan study: to assess the reproducibility in a routine clinical setting, 2 repeat bone scans were obtained from metastatic prostate cancer patients after a single 600-MBq (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate injection. Follow-up bone scan study: 2 follow-up bone scans of metastatic prostate cancer patients were analyzed to determine the interobserver variability between the automated BSIs and the visual interpretations in assessing changes. The automated BSI was generated using the upgraded EXINI bone(BSI) software (version 2). The results were evaluated using linear regression, Pearson correlation, Cohen κ measurement, coefficient of variation, and SD.  Results:   Linearity of the automated BSI interpretations in the range of 0.10-13.0 was confirmed, and Pearson correlation was observed at 0.995 (n = 50; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-0.99; P < 0.0001). The mean coefficient of variation was less than 20%. The mean BSI difference between the 2 repeat bone scans of 35 patients was 0.05 (SD = 0.15), with an upper confidence limit of 0.30. The interobserver agreement in the automated BSI interpretations was more consistent (κ = 0.96, P < 0.0001) than the qualitative visual assessment of the changes (κ = 0.70, P < 0.0001) was in the bone scans of 173 patients.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all patients with HIV in the State-wide HIV referral centre in Victoria, who were diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2000 onwards. In all, 12 patients were identified, and the medical records were reviewed to collect data on HIV parameters at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis, as well as prostate cancer clinicopathological characteristics, treatment details and outcomes.  Results:   At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis, eight patients had undetectable viral load, and the median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count was 485 cells/μL. The average age at diagnosis of prostate cancer was 63 years and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 11.1 ng/mL. Four patients had Gleason 6 prostate cancer, four Gleason 7, one Gleason 8 and three Gleason 9. Seven of the 12 patients had a positive family history for prostate cancer. Of the patients with clinically localised prostate cancer (10), most were treated with radiotherapy (RT): one permanent seed brachytherapy (BT), five external beam RT (EBRT), two open radical prostatectomies (RP), one active surveillance (AS), and one on watchful waiting (WW). For the two patients with metastatic disease, one had androgen-deprivation therapy and EBRT, while the other had a combination of EBRT and chemo-hormonal therapy with doxetacel. All patients were followed for a median of 46 months, with three deaths reported, none of which was a prostate cancer-specific death.  Conclusions:   This is the first Australasian series on prostate cancer management in a HIV population. With the prolonged survival among HIV-positive men in the highly active anti-retroviral therapy era, PSA testing should be offered to this group of patients, especially those with a positive family history.

C3G produced anti-proliferative effects through activation of caspase-3 and induction of p21 protein expression. The reduced cell viability was associated with a clear increase of DNA fragmentation in both cell lines after C3G treatment. Since LnCap and DU145 exhibited differences in sensitivity to C3G treatment, the redox state of these cells was further investigated by estimating the levels of ROS and GSH. C3G antioxidant activity was confirmed only in DU145 cell line. Treatment with C3G increased the levels of tumor suppressor P75NGFR, indicating a possible role of C3G in the acquisition of a normal-like cell phenotype.

Then, we observed that the knockdown of both E2F1 and PBK could suppress cell proliferation, invasion and migration of PCa cell lines in vitro. Based on Taylor dataset, we found that PBK upregulation occurred more frequently in PCa patients with the older age of patients (P=0.044), the higher Gleason score (P<0.001), the advanced clinical pathological stage (P=0.019), the presence of metastasis (P=0.008), the overall survival (P<0.001) and PSA failure (P=0.004). More interestingly, the survival analysis identified PBK as an independent factor for predicting the biochemical recurrence-free survival of PCa patients (P=0.041). Taken together, these findings offer the convincing evidence for the first time that the overexpression of PBK may lead to high malignant phenotype in PCa cells via the regulation of E2F1.

It has been recognized that diet can play a crucial role in PC genesis and progression. In this context, free fatty acids are considered as modulators of cell proliferation. Recently, a relationship between the composition of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) and cell proliferation has been discussed. The aim of this study was to analyse the interrelationship between CL composition and the proliferation of prostate cells by exposing PC-3 tumour cells to different fatty acids and by analysing the CL composition in prostate tissue from PC patients after prostatectomy. Among the applied fatty acids, palmitic acid was found to stimulate proliferation of PC-3 cells, whereas oleic acid (OA) had an inhibiting effect. The lipidomic analysis of CL revealed that fatty acids supplied to PC-3 cells were incorporated into CL molecules. Further, the CL content of palmitoleic acid (C16:1) exclusively correlated with the proliferation of PC-3 cells. The CL composition significantly differed between tumour and normal prostate tissue from PC patients. In five out of six patients, the CL content of palmitoleic acid was higher in tumour prostate tissue in comparison to normal prostate tissue. Our data illustrate that the composition of CL can be easily modified by the fatty acid environment of cells. OA was most effective in decreasing the amount of palmitoleic acid within the CL molecules and deceleration of PC-3 cell proliferation. In conclusion, a diet rich in OA might be beneficial in protecting from rapid proliferation of PC cells.""","""['Anja Sapandowski', 'Matthias Stope', 'Katja Evert', 'Matthias Evert', 'Uwe Zimmermann', 'Daniela Peter', 'Ilona Päge', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Lorenz Schild']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin is involved in the regulation of T-cell proliferation.', 'Proliferation of C6 glioma cells requires the phospholipid remodeling enzyme tafazzin independent of cardiolipin composition.', 'Early modification of the fatty acid composition of cardiolipins and other phospholipids in rat liver mitochondria during dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids followed by repletion.', 'Decreased expression of lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0/OH) in high resolution imaging mass spectrometry independently predicts biochemical recurrence after surgical treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Biochemistry of cardiolipin: sensitivity to dietary fatty acids.', 'Orchestral role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in T-cell malignancy.', 'Advances in methods to analyse cardiolipin and their clinical applications.', 'Mass spectrometry imaging discriminates glioblastoma tumor cell subpopulations and different microvascular formations based on their lipid profiles.', 'Unravelling Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity Using Spatial Approaches to Lipidomics and Transcriptomics.', 'The Real Cytotoxic Effect of Artemisinins on Colon Cancer Cells in a Physiological Cell Culture Setting.

Previous studies established the prolonged serum half-life of Abdurins, the result of a retained FcRn binding motif. Here we present data on the construction of large, diverse, phage-display and cell-free DNA display libraries and the isolation of high affinity binders to the cancer target, membrane-bound ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase class A2 (EphA2). Antigen binding regions were created by designing combinatorial libraries into the structural loops and Abdurins were selected using phage display methods. Initial binders were reformatted into new maturation libraries and low nanomolar binders were isolated using cell-free DNA display, CIS display. Further characterization confirmed binding of the Abdurins to both human and murine EphA2 proteins and exclusively to cell lines that expressed EphA2, followed by rapid internalization.

Expression of miR-34a induced apoptosis in PCa cells, and, in accord with downregulation of targets associated with PCa growth, including MET and Axl and c-Myc, also induced a form of non-canonical autophagy that is independent of Beclin-1, ATG4, ATG5 and ATG7. MiR-34a-induced autophagy is anti-proliferative in prostate cancer cells, as blocking apoptosis still resulted in growth inhibition of tumor cells. Thus, combined effects of autophagy and apoptosis are responsible for miR-34a-mediated prostate tumor growth inhibition, and have translational impact, as this non-canonical form of autophagy is tumor inhibitory.

To address the aforementioned questions, we conducted in vitro ALA signaling studies using human (HT29) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines. We observed that cell proliferation is reduced by ALA administration in a dose-dependent manner in human and mouse colon cancer cell lines.

Mean age was 69.7 years (SD 12.7), and 429 patients were males. Consistent sleep disturbances (moderate to maximum) were found in 60.8% of patients. Aged patients were less likely to have sleep disturbances, whereas a poor Karnofsky level was significantly associated with sleep problems. Breast, gastrointestinal, head and neck, lung, and prostate cancers were associated with sleep problems. Patients who had a secondary school or undergraduate education had less sleep disturbances. Hormone therapy and use of opioids and corticosteroids were positively associated with sleep disturbances, and there was a positive correlation of HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression scores with sleep disturbances.

However, the role of DHRS7 in PCa is largely unknown and the impact of DHRS7 modulation on cancer cell properties has not yet been studied. Here, we investigated DHRS7 expression in normal human prostate and PCa tissue samples at different tumor grade using tissue microarray and immunovisualization. Moreover, we characterized the effects of siRNA-mediated DHRS7 knockdown on the properties of three distinct human prostate cell lines. We found that DHRS7 protein expression decreases alongside tumor grade, as judged by the Gleason level, in PCa tissue samples. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of DHRS7 expression in the human PCa cell lines LNCaP, BPH1, and PC3 significantly increased cell proliferation in LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in all of the investigated cell lines. Furthermore, cell adhesion was decreased upon DHRS7 knockdown in all three cell lines. To begin to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of DHRS7 depletion, we performed a microarray study with samples from LNCaP cells treated with DHRS7-specific siRNA. Several genes involved in cell proliferation and adhesion pathways were found to be altered in DHRS7-depleted LNCaP cells. Additionally, genes of the BRCA1/2 pathway and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition regulator E-cadherin were altered following DHRS7 knockdown.

However, its exact functions and molecular mechanisms in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a chemoresistant carcinoma with poor prognosis, remain unclear. In this study we found that RXRα was frequently overexpressed in human CCA tissues and CCA cell lines. Downregulation of RXRα led to decreased expression of mitosis-promoting factors including cyclin D1and cyclin E, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, as well as increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21, resulting in inhibition of CCA cell proliferation. Furthermore, RXRα knockdown attenuated the expression of cyclin D1 through suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Retinoid X receptor α upregulated proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression through nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways, paralleled with downregulation of p21. Thus, the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways account for the inhibition of CCA cell growth induced by RXRα downregulation.

Subsequently, using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that PGE2-induced mTORC1 activation is mediated by the EP4/cAMP/PKA pathway, as well as an EP1/Ca(2+)-dependent pathway. The cooperative roles of the two pathways were supported by the maximal inhibition achieved with the combined pharmacological blockade, and the coexistence of highly expressed EP1 (mediating the Ca(2+) response) and EP2 or EP4 (mediating the cAMP/PKA pathway) in PANC-1 cells and in the prostate cancer line PC-3, which also robustly exhibited PGE2-induced mTORC1 activation, as identified from a screen in various cancer cell lines. Importantly, we showed a reinforcing interaction between PGE2 and IGF-1 on mTORC1 signaling, with an increase in IL-23 production as a cellular outcome. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of PGE2-stimulated mTORC1 activation mediated by EP4/cAMP/PKA and EP1/Ca(2+) signaling, which may be of great importance in elucidating the promoting effects of obesity in pancreatic cancer. Ultimately, a precise understanding of these molecular links may provide novel targets for efficacious interventions devoid of adverse effects.""","""['Hui-Hua Chang', 'Steven H Young', 'James Sinnett-Smith', 'Caroline Ei Ne Chou', 'Aune Moro', 'Kathleen M Hertzer', 'Oscar Joe Hines', 'Enrique Rozengurt', 'Guido Eibl']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Cell Physiol""","""['Direct growth-inhibitory effects of prostaglandin E2 in\xa0pancreatic cancer cells in\xa0vitro through an EP4/PKA-mediated mechanism.', 'Endogenous prostaglandin E2 amplifies IL-33 production by macrophages through an E prostanoid (EP)2/EP4-cAMP-EPAC-dependent pathway.', 'PGE2 upregulates renin through E-prostanoid receptor 1 via PKC/cAMP/CREB pathway in M-1 cells.', 'Cooperation of two subtypes of PGE2 receptor, Gi coupled EP3 and Gs coupled EP2 or EP4 subtype.', 'Prostaglandin E2 EP receptors in cardiovascular disease: An update.', 'Role of Interleukins in Inflammation-Mediated Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Colorectal Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'Lipocalin 2 Deficiency Alters Prostaglandin Biosynthesis and mTOR Signaling Regulation of Thermogenesis and Lipid Metabolism in Adipocytes.', 'Targeting mTOR in the Context of Diet and Whole-body Metabolism.', 'G-Protein Coupled Receptor Signaling and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Regulation.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.']"""

In this study, we investigate the expression levels of the HOX A-D genes in PCa. The functional relevance and potential of HOX gene as biomarkers are explored.  Methods:   We evaluated HOX gene expression in prostate tissues of different grade and stage and related the outcome to clinical parameters. We analyzed AR regulation and function of HOXC6 in PCa cell lines. We developed a urine-based HOXC6 mRNA assay for diagnostic purposes.  Results:   HOXC6 was one of the most upregulated HOX genes in all primary, metastasized, and castration-resistant PCa. HOXC6 upregulation was specific to the epithelial component of PCa, and HOXC6 was shown to be involved in epithelial cell proliferation. HOXC6 expression was not influenced by androgens nor by treatments targeting the AR signaling pathway. HOXC6 expression was not related to a prognosis after radical prostatectomy, that is, biochemical or local recurrence. We successfully developed an assay for HOXC6 mRNA detection in urine and confirmed that HOXC6 levels are higher in PCa patients.  Conclusions:   HOXC6 has a role in all PCa stages, particularly in PCa cell proliferation. Due to its stable expression, HOXC6 is a novel candidate biomarker for PCa not only in early detection but also for monitoring of progression or response to therapy.""","""['Agus Rizal A H Hamid', 'A Marije Hoogland', 'Frank Smit', 'Sander Jannink', 'Cindy van Rijt-van de Westerlo', 'Cornelius F J Jansen', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Gerald W Verhaegh', 'Jack A Schalken']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['IgG gene expression and its possible significance in prostate cancers.', 'HOXC6 in the prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prolactin- and testosterone-induced carboxypeptidase-D correlates with increased nitrotyrosines and Ki67 in prostate cancer.', 'Importance of HOX genes in normal prostate gland formation, prostate cancer development and its early detection.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptome Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene-Transcript Expression in Urine Supernatant and Urine Cell-Sediment Are Different but Equally Useful for Detecting Prostate Cancer.', 'Lung Cancer Gene Regulatory Network of Transcription Factors Related to the Hallmarks of Cancer.', 'HOXC6 Regulates the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through the TGF-β/Smad Signaling Pathway and Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Glioblastoma.', 'Expression Profiles of HOXC6 Predict the Survival of Glioblastoma Patients and Correlate with Cell Cycle.']"""

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the TCTN1 gene on the viability and migration of prostate cancer cells. Lentivirus‑mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed to silence the expression of TCTN1 in PC‑3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using MTT and colony formation assays, and the distribution of cells in phases of the cell cycle was determined using flow cytometry. Cell migration was detected using a Transwell assay. The results demonstrated that TCTN1 was widely expressed in several human prostate cancer cell lines. Knockdown of the TCTN1 gene by RNA interference markedly suppressed cell viability and colony formation in the PC‑3 and DU145 cell lines. Cell cycle progression was also arrested by TCTN1 silencing. In addition, knockdown of the TCTN1 gene led to the inhibition of cell migration in the two cell lines. These findings confirmed the direct association between the TCTN1 gene and prostate cancer growth in vitro. With further understanding and clinical investigation, this indicates the potential for future development of a novel marker for early detection and gene therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Zhijun Wang', 'Yi Gao', 'Yushan Liu', 'Jie Chen', 'Junkai Wang', 'Sishun Gan', 'Danfeng Xu', 'Xingang Cui']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Lentivirus-Mediated Knockdown of TCTN1 Inhibits Glioma Cell Proliferation.', 'Tectonic 1 accelerates gastric cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in vitro.', 'Small interference RNA-mediated silencing of prostate stem cell antigen attenuates growth, reduces migration and invasion of human prostate cancer PC-3M cells.', 'Phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) is overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissue and promotes growth and migration.', 'Knockdown of lipocalin-2 suppresses the growth and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', '5-Acetamido-1-(methoxybenzyl) isatin inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.', 'Function and transcriptional regulation of TCTN1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Prognostic Implications of Novel Ten-Gene Signature in Uveal Melanoma.', 'MiR-216a-5p targets TCTN1 to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'MiR-1256 suppresses proliferation and migration of non-small cell lung cancer via regulating TCTN1.']"""

We set out to determine whether attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis or variable selection techniques employing genetic algorithm or successive projection algorithm could be utilised to explore differences between prostate tissues from differing years. In total, 156 prostate tissues from transurethral resection of the prostate procedures for benign prostatic hyperplasia from 1983 to 2013 were collected. These were distributed to form seven categories: 1983-1984 (n = 20), 1988-1989 (n = 25), 1993-1994 (n = 21), 1998-1999 (n = 21), 2003-2004 (n = 21), 2008-2009 (n = 20) and 2012-2013 (n = 21). Ten-μm-thick tissue sections were floated onto Low-E (IR-reflective) slides for ATR-FTIR or Raman spectroscopy. The prostate tissue spectral phenotype altered in a temporal fashion. Examination of the two categories that are at least one generation (30 years) apart indicated highly-significant segregation, especially in spectral regions containing DNA and RNA bands (≈1,000-1,490 cm(-1)). This may point towards alterations that have occurred through genotoxicity or through epigenetic modifications. Immunohistochemical studies for global DNA methylation supported this.

However, due to the complex suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, blocking one or a few inhibitory signals has only limited effects on therapeutic efficacy. Instead of targeting tumor immunosuppression, we considered from another point of view, and hypothesized that manipulating T cells to make them resist any known or unknown suppressive mechanism may be more effective for cancer treatment.  Methods:   We used OT-1 cells transduced with retroviruses encoding Akt and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) transduced with retroviruses encoding both Akt and a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for tumor antigen EpCAM to examine the effect of over-expressing Akt on tumor specific T cells in tumor environment.  Results:   We show that Akt activity of T cells in the tumor environment was inhibited, and over-expressing Akt in OT-1 cells increased the cytokine production and cell proliferation in the presence of B16-OVA tumor cells. What's more, adoptive transfer of OT-1 cells over-expressing Akt inhibited B16-OVA tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. To examine if over-expressing Akt could increase the anti-tumor activity of T cells in human cancer, PBLs co-expressing EpCAM specific CAR and Akt were cultured with EpCAM-expressing human prostate cancer cells PC3M, and less inhibition on cell proliferation and less apoptosis were observed. In addition, adoptive transfer of PC3M specific T cells over-expressing Akt resulted in more dramatic tumor inhibitory effects in PC3M bearing NOD/SCID mice.  Conclusions:   These data indicates that over-expressing Akt in tumor specific T cells increases T cell proliferation and activity in the tumor environment, and enhances anti-tumor effects of adoptively transferred T cells.

The impact of hypofractionated treatment on sexual function, irritative symptoms, and voiding symptoms has not been determined within the same patient population. Here we present our institutional data on sexual function, voiding function, irritative symptoms, and treatment response following SBRT.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis includes 102 non-metastatic patients treated with SBRT at a single institution between May 2008 and September 2014. The course of radiotherapy consisted of 36.25 Gy (range 35-40) over five daily fractions. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), and PSA were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after treatment.  Results:   Median patient age was 72 years old with a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Pretreatment IPSS-I score was 5.21, increasing to 6.97 (p < .001) after 1 month. The mean IPSS-I score returned close to baseline after 3 months to 5.86 and decreased to below baseline after 2 years to 5.09. At 3 months, 9 months, and 2 years, 47.5, 76.2, and 91.1% of patients had reached IPSS-I resolution. The mean IPSS-O score prior to treatment was 5.31 and there was an increase in the score to 6.45 (p = 0.344) at 1 month. The score remained close to baseline and decreased to 4.00 at 2 years and significantly decreased to 3.74 (p = 0.035) at 3 years. 64.4, 82.1, and 96.0% of patients had IPSS-O resolution by 3 months, 9 months, and 2 years. The mean SHIM score prior to treatment was 13.52 and continually decreased to below baseline a year after treatment to 10.56 (p < .001). SHIM score began to improve at 18 months, but was still significantly less than baseline at 12.12 (p = .01).  Conclusions:   While an increase in AUA/IPSS score initially occurred, all patients resume normal activities immediately following treatment and the AUA/IPSS symptoms improved from baseline. Irittative symptoms take longer to resolve when compared to obstructive voiding symptoms in patients treated with SBRT.

An emerging mechanism underlying the CRPCa phenotype and predicting response to therapy is the expression of the constitutively-active AR-V7 splice variant generated by AR cryptic exon 3b inclusion. Here, we explore the role of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Sam68 (encoded by KHDRBS1), which is over-expressed in clinical PCa, on AR-V7 expression and transcription function. Using a minigene reporter, we show that Sam68 controls expression of exon 3b resulting in an increase in endogenous AR-V7 mRNA and protein expression in RNA-binding-dependent manner. We identify a novel protein-protein interaction between Sam68 and AR-V7 mediated by a common domain shared with full-length AR, and observe these proteins in the cell nucleoplasm. Using a luciferase reporter, we demonstrate that Sam68 co-activates ligand-independent AR-V7 transcriptional activity in an RNA-binding-independent manner, and controls expression of the endogenous AR-V7-specific gene target UBE2C. Our data suggest that Sam68 has separable effects on the regulation of AR-V7 expression and transcriptional activity, through its RNA-binding capacity.
