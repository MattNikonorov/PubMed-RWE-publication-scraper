We previously investigated MHY219, a new HDAC inhibitor, and its potent anticancer activity in human prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated MHY219 molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of prostate cancer cell migration. Similar to suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA), MHY219 inhibited HDAC1 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. MHY219 cytotoxicity was higher in LNCaP (IC50=0.67 μM) than in DU145 cells (IC50=1.10 μM) and PC3 cells (IC50=5.60 μM) after 48 h of treatment. MHY219 significantly inhibited the HDAC1 protein levels in LNCaP and DU145 cells at high concentrations. However, inhibitory effects of MHY219 on HDAC proteins levels varied based on the cell type. MHY219 significantly inhibited LNCaP and DU145 cells migration by down-regulation of matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-2 and induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). These results suggest that MHY219 may potentially be used as an anticancer agent to block cancer cell migration through the repression of MMP-1 and MMP-2, which is related to the reduction of HDAC1.""","""['Umasankar De', 'Soma Kundu', 'Nabanita Patra', 'Mee Young Ahn', 'Ji Hae Ahn', 'Ji Yeon Son', 'Jung Hyun Yoon', 'Hyung Ryoung Moon', 'Byung Mu Lee', 'Hyung Sik Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomol Ther (Seoul)""","""['A novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MHY219\xa0induces apoptosis via up-regulation of androgen receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Marine-derived chromopeptide A, a novel class I HDAC inhibitor, suppresses human prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.', 'A New Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, MHY4381, Induces Apoptosis via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Green tea-induced epigenetic reactivation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 suppresses prostate cancer progression through histone-modifying enzymes.', 'Histone deacetylase as a new target for cancer chemotherapy.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Combinatorial Approaches to Tackle the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Long Non-Coding RNA Landscape in Prostate Cancer Molecular Subtypes: A Feature Selection Approach.', 'Design of Fluorescent Coumarin-Hydroxamic Acid Derivatives as Inhibitors of HDACs: Synthesis, Anti-Proliferative Evaluation and Docking Studies.', 'Pro-apoptotic effect of the novel benzylidene derivative MHY695 in human colon cancer cells.']"""

Since telomere dysfunction in other systems is known to activate ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways, we investigated the role of ATM-mediated DDR signaling in AR-inactivated prostate cancer cells. Indeed, the induction of telomere dysfunction in cells treated with AR-antagonists (Casodex or MDV3100) or AR-siRNA was associated with a dramatic increase in phosphorylation (activation) of ATM and its downstream effector Chk2 and the presenceof phosphorylated ATM at telomeres, indicating activation of DDR signaling at telomeres. Moreover, Casodex washout led to the reversal of telomere dysfunction, indicating repair of damaged telomeres. ATM inhibitor blocked ATM phosphorylation, induced PARP cleavage, abrogated cell cycle checkpoint activation and attenuated the formation of γH2AX foci at telomeres in AR-inactivated cells, suggesting that ATM inhibitor induces apoptosis in AR-inactivated cells by blocking the repair of damaged DNA at telomeres. Finally, colony formation assay revealed a dramatic decrease in the survival of cells co-treated with Casodex and ATM inhibitor as compared with those treated with either Casodex or ATM inhibitor alone. These observations indicate that inhibitors of DDR signaling pathways may offer a unique opportunity to enhance the potency of AR-targeted therapies for the treatment of androgen-sensitive as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Vidyavathi Reddy', 'Min Wu', 'Nicholas Ciavattone', 'Nathan McKenty', 'Mani Menon', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'G Prem-Veer Reddy', 'Sahn-Ho Kim']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Androgen receptor inactivation induces telomere DNA damage, and damage response inhibition leads to cell death.', 'Structural and functional association of androgen receptor with telomeres in prostate cancer cells.', 'Gallic acid causes inactivating phosphorylation of cdc25A/cdc25C-cdc2 via ATM-Chk2 activation, leading to cell cycle arrest, and induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells.', 'ATM in DNA repair in cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Enzymatic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 infection with an emphasis on the telomere-associated enzymes.', 'Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms, and Preclinical and Clinical Data.']"""

In this study, we report on the comparative targeting efficiency toward prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) of a number of different ligands that are covalently attached by the same chemistry to a polymeric nanocarrier. The targeting ligands included a small molecule (glutamate urea), a peptide ligand, and a monoclonal antibody (J591). A hyperbranched polymer (HBP) was utilized as the nanocarrier and contained a fluorophore for tracking/analysis, whereas the pendant functional chain-ends provided a handle for ligand conjugation. Targeting efficiency of each ligand was assessed in vitro using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to compare degree of binding and internalization of the HBPs by human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines with different PSMA expression status (PC3-PIP (PSMA+) and PC3-FLU (PSMA-). The peptide ligand was further investigated in vivo, in which BALB/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous PC3-PIP and PC3-FLU PCa tumors were injected intravenously with the HBP-peptide conjugate and assessed by fluorescence imaging. Enhanced accumulation in the tumor tissue of PC3-PIP compared to PC3-FLU highlighted the applicability of this system as a future imaging and therapeutic delivery vehicle.""","""['Adrian V Fuchs', 'Brian W C Tse', 'Amanda K Pearce', 'Mei-Chun Yeh', 'Nicholas L Fletcher', 'Steve S Huang', 'Warren D Heston', 'Andrew K Whittaker', 'Pamela J Russell', 'Kristofer J Thurecht']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Tumor Uptake of Triazine Dendrimers Decorated with Four, Sixteen, and Sixty-Four PSMA-Targeted Ligands: Passive versus Active Tumor Targeting.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.', '(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Ligand-targeted particulate nanomedicines undergoing clinical evaluation: current status.', 'Enhanced drug delivery to cancer cells through a pH-sensitive polycarbonate platform.', 'KLK4 Induces Anti-Tumor Effects in Human Xenograft Mouse Models of Orthotopic and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Cellular Delivery of Bioorthogonal Pretargeting Therapeutics in PSMA-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiolabeling of Nucleic Acid Aptamers for Highly Sensitive Disease-Specific Molecular Imaging.', '111In- and IRDye800CW-Labeled PLA-PEG Nanoparticle for Imaging Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Expressing Tissues.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between June 2012 and August 2014, 210 men presenting to our institution for prostate biopsy with ≥1 prior negative biopsy underwent multiparametric MRI followed by MRF-TB and SB and were entered into a prospective database. Clinical characteristics, maximum mpMRI suspicion scores (mSS), and biopsy results were queried from the database, and the detection rates of Gleason ≥7 prostate cancer (PCa) and overall PCa were compared between biopsy techniques using McNemar's test.  Results:   Forty seven (29%) of 161 men meeting inclusion criteria (mean age, 65 ± 8 years; mean prostate-specific antigen, 8.9 ± 8.9) were found to have PCa. MRF-TB and SB had overall cancer detection rates (CDRs) of 21.7% and 18.6% (P = .36), respectively, and CDR for Gleason score (GS) ≥7 disease of 14.9% and 9.3% (P = .02), respectively. Of 26 men with GS ≥7 disease, MRF-TB detected 24 (92.3%) whereas SB detected 15 (57.7%; P < .01). Using UCSF-CAPRA criteria, only 1 man was restratified from low risk to higher risk based on SB results compared to MRF-TB alone. Among men with mSS <4, 72% of detected cancers were low risk by UCSF-CAPRA criteria.  Conclusion:   In men with previous negative biopsies and persistent suspicion of PCa, SB contributes little to the detection of GS ≥7 disease by MRF-TB, and avoidance of SB bears consideration. Based on the low likelihood of detecting GS ≥7 cancer and overall low-risk features of PCa in men with mSS <4, limiting biopsy to men with mSS ≥4 warrants further investigation.""","""['Neil Mendhiratta', 'Xiaosong Meng', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'James S Wysock', 'Michael Fenstermaker', 'Richard Huang', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Ming Zhou', 'William C Huang', 'Herbert Lepor', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Prostate Biopsy in a Consecutive Cohort of Men with No Previous Biopsy: Reduction of Over Detection through Improved Risk Stratification.', 'The ultrasound characteristics of regions identified as suspicious by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predict the likelihood of clinically significant cancer on MRI-ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsy.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'Cost-effectiveness of an urinary biomarker panel in combination with MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Combining targeted and systematic prostate biopsy improves prostate cancer detection and correlation with the whole mount histopathology in biopsy naïve and previous negative biopsy patients.', 'MRI/US fusion transperineal versus transrectral biopsy of prostate cancer: Outcomes and complication rates, a tertiary medical center experience in the Middle East.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsies for clinical decision-making among patients with previously negative transrectal ultrasound biopsy and persistent prostate-specific antigen elevation.', 'A Prospective Study and Single-Center Experience: Effectivity of Fusion Prostate Biopsy in Biopsy-Naïve Patients.']"""

Methods:   We studied pathologic outcomes in men who underwent RP after some time on AS. Pathologic outcomes were compared between men with and without evidence of disease reclassification on AS. Rates of adverse pathology (defined as pathologic stage ≥ pT3a, RP Gleason ≥ 4+3, or lymph node involvement) were determined and were compared depending on the variable that defined disease reclassification.  Results:   Of 1086 men enrolled in AS, 130 (12.0%) underwent RP after a median time of 1.96 years (range, 0.55-12.26 years) on AS. Ninety-seven (74.6%) of these men had evidence of disease reclassification on AS. Rates of adverse pathology were greater in men with evidence of reclassification compared to those without (P = .05). Among men with disease reclassification, rates of adverse pathology ranged from 23.8% to 44.7% depending on the variable used to define reclassification. Longer time on AS was not associated with adverse pathology (P = .68).  Conclusion:   Adverse pathology after RP is more common in men with evidence of disease reclassification on AS compared to those undergoing RP for other reasons. However, we identified varying outcomes among these patients depending on the criterion that defined reclassification.

Here, we describe safety results of extended denosumab therapy in patients with bone metastases from the open-label extension phase of two phase 3 trials.  Methods:   Patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer received subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg Q4W or intravenous ZA 4 mg Q4W in a double-blinded fashion. Denosumab demonstrated superior efficacy in the blinded treatment phase; thus, patients were offered open-label denosumab for up to an additional 2 years.  Results:   Cumulative median (Q1, Q3) denosumab exposure was 19.1 (9.2, 32.2) months in the breast cancer trial (n = 1019) and 12.0 (5.6, 21.3) months in the prostate cancer trial (n = 942); 295 patients received denosumab for >3 years. No new safety signals were identified during the open-label phase, or among patients who switched from ZA to denosumab. During the blinded treatment phase, exposure-adjusted subject incidences of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were 49 (1.9%) and 31 (1.2%) in the denosumab and ZA groups, respectively. In total, 32 (6.9%) and 25 (5.5 %) new cases of ONJ (not adjusted for exposure) were reported for patients continuing and switching to denosumab, respectively. The incidences of hypocalcemia were 4.3 and 3.1%, in patients continuing and switching to denosumab, respectively.  Conclusion:   These results describe the safety profile of denosumab after long-term exposure, or after switching to denosumab from ZA. No new safety signals were identified.

Methods:   Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of cancer were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. Cancer mortality to incidence ratios (MIRs) were calculated to represent cancer survival. The data were analysed based on the four regions in Asia and income.  Results:   Cancer incidence rate is lower in Asia compared to the West but for MIR, it is the reverse. In Asia, the most common cancers in men are lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal cancers while the most common cancers in women are breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and stomach cancers. The MIRs are the highest in lung, liver and stomach cancers and the lowest in colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. Eastern and Western Asia have a higher incidence of cancer compared to South-Eastern and South-Central Asia but this pattern is the reverse for MIR. Cancer incidence rate increases with country income particularly in colorectal and breast cancers but the pattern is the opposite for MIR.

It has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in many solid tumors including human prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the tissue distribution of PPAR-γ in normal canine lung, canine lung cancer, and metastatic to lung cancer, as well as determine the role, if any, of DNA methylation in epigenetic control of gene expression. The protein was studied using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and DNA methylation was studied using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), and methylation-specific PCR (MSP).  Results:   PPAR-γ is expressed in all large conducting airways, particularly in goblet cells and bronchial glands, in the canine lung. The protein is also expressed in interstitial macrophages. PPAR-γ is expressed in 33 % of canine non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 66 % of metastatic osteosarcoma (OSA) cases. There is a significant loss of 5' PPAR-γ methylation from normal lung to primary lung cancer and metastatic OSA (p = 0.0002), however altered PPAR-γ promoter methylation at the interrogated locus does not appear to be associated with changes in protein expression.  Conclusions:   PPAR-γ protein is expressed in normal canine lung tissue, canine primary lung cancer, and metastatic OSA.

This decline in PSA was proportional to the decline in cholesterol, suggesting a link between cholesterol and PSA levels. Whether these associations vary by race has not been explored and therefore we examined the association between pre-statin serum cholesterol and PSA in black and white prostate cancer-free men.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 1,163 men (709 white and 454 black) without prostate cancer who initiated a statin between 1994 and 2006. Linear regression was used to test the association between pre-statin serum cholesterol and PSA levels, adjusting for potential confounders and stratifying by race.  Results:   Black men were younger, had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (both P < 0.05) and a trend toward higher total cholesterol (P = 0.063). There was no difference in PSA or year of statin prescription by race (P = 0.900 and P = 0.217, respectively). On multivariable analysis, we found a positive correlation between serum PSA and total cholesterol (P = 0.005) and LDL (P = 0.003) in white men, but no association among black men. HDL was not significantly related to PSA levels in black or white men (both P > 0.5).  Conclusions:   Among prostate cancer-free men about to begin a statin, pre-statin total cholesterol and LDL were correlated with PSA levels in white, but not black men.

An important negative regulator of protease activity is TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3). TIMP3 expression is lacking in many cancers including advanced prostate cancer, and this may facilitate invasion and metastasis by allowing unrestrained protease activity.  Methods:   To investigate the role of TIMP3 in prostate cancer progression, we crossed TIMP3-deficient mice (Timp3(-/-)) to mice with prostate-specific deletion of the tumor suppressor Pten (Pten(-/-)), a well-established mouse model of prostate cancer. Tumor growth and progression were compared between Pten(-/-), Timp3(-/-) and control (Pten(-/-), Timp3(+/+)) mice at 16 weeks of age by histopathology and markers of proliferation, vascularity, and tumor invasion. Metalloproteinase activity within the tumors was assessed by gelatin zymography. Inflammatory infiltrates were assessed by immunohistochemistry for macrophages and lymphocytes whereas expression of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators was assessed by quantitative real time PCR and multiplex ELISA.  Results:   Increased tumor growth, proliferation index, increased microvascular density, and invasion was observed in Pten(-/-), Timp3(-/-) prostate tumors compared to Pten(-/-), Timp3(+/+) tumors. Tumor cell invasion in Pten(-/-), Timp3(-/-) mice was associated with increased expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 and activation of MMP-2. There was markedly increased inflammatory cell infiltration into the TIMP3-deficient prostate tumors along with increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, cyclooxygenase-2, TNF-α, and interleukin-1β; all of which are implicated in inflammation and cancer.

In this study, we determine whether methylation changes of androgen biosynthesis pathway (ABP)-related genes in patients' plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can serve as prognostic markers for biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Methods:   Methyl-binding domain capture sequencing (MBDCap-seq) was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in primary tumors of patients who subsequently developed BCR or not, respectively. Methylation pyrosequencing of candidate loci was validated in cfDNA samples of 86 PCa patients taken at and/or post-radical prostatectomy (RP) using univariate and multivariate prediction analyses.  Results:   Putative DMRs in 13 of 30 ABP-related genes were found between tumors of BCR (n = 12) versus no evidence of disease (NED) (n = 15). In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data confirmed increased DNA methylation of two loci-SRD5A2 and CYP11A1, which also correlated with their decreased expression, in tumors with subsequent BCR development. Their aberrant cfDNA methylation was also associated with detectable levels of PSA taken after patients' post-RP. Multivariate analysis of the change in cfDNA methylation at all of CpG sites measured along with patient's treatment history predicted if a patient will develop BCR with 77.5% overall accuracy.  Conclusions:   Overall, increased DNA methylation of SRD5A2 and CYP11A1 related to androgen biosynthesis functions may play a role in BCR after patients' RP.

Subjects and methods:   The study cohort comprised all attendees of the Swiss arm of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) with systematic PSA level tests every 4 years. Men reporting first-degree relative(s) diagnosed with prostate cancer were considered to have a positive FH. Biopsy was exclusively PSA triggered at a PSA level threshold of 3 ng/mL. The primary endpoint was prostate cancer diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used.  Results:   Of 4 932 attendees with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 60.9 (57.6-65.1) years, 334 (6.8%) reported a positive FH. The median (IQR) follow-up duration was 11.6 (10.3-13.3) years. Cumulative prostate cancer incidence was 60/334 (18%, positive FH) and 550/4 598 (12%, negative FH) [odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.2, P = 0.001). In both groups, most prostate cancer diagnosed was low grade. There were no significant differences in PSA level at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason score or Gleason score on pathological specimen among men who underwent radical prostatectomy between both groups. On multivariable analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06), baseline PSA level (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.12-1.14), and FH (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.24-2.14) were independent predictors for overall prostate cancer incidence (all P < 0.001).

Results:   Out of 2 957 patients included in the HAROW study, 447 chose AS. The median follow-up was 28.3 months. T1a, T1b, T1c and T2a disease were diagnosed in 81, 18, 292 and 56 patients, respectively. Patients in the IPCa group had lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (4.2 vs 6.1 ng/mL) and more comorbidities than those diagnosed by core needle biospy.

These effects are related to arrest of an AR/chaperone complex in the cytoplasm. Here, we compared MJC13 and classic AR antagonists such as flutamide and bicalutamide. Microarray analysis and confirmatory qRT-PCR reveals that MJC13 and flutamide inhibit dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-dependent genes in LNCaP PC cells. Both compounds are equally effective on a genome wide basis and as effective as second generation AR antagonists (MDV3100, ARN-509) at selected genes. MJC13 inhibits AR binding to the prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter more strongly than flutamide, consistent with different mechanisms of action. Examination of efficacy of MJC13 in conditions that reflect aspects castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) reveals that it inhibits flutamide activation of an AR mutant (ART877A) that emerges during flutamide withdrawal syndrome, but displays greatly restricted gene-specific activity in 22Rv1 cells that express a constitutively active truncated AR and is inactive against glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which can co-opt androgen-dependent signaling networks in CRPC. Importantly, MJC13 inhibits AR interactions with SRC2 and β-catenin in the nucleus and, unlike flutamide, strongly inhibits amplification of AR activity obtained with transfected SRC2 and β-catenin. MJC13 also inhibits DHT and β-catenin-enhanced cell division in LNCaP cells. Thus, a surface-directed antagonist can block AR activity in some conditions in which a classic antagonist fails and may display utility in particular forms of CRPC.""","""['Ji Ho Suh', 'Arundhati Chattopadhyay', 'Douglas H Sieglaff', 'Cheryl Storer Samaniego', 'Marc B Cox', 'Paul Webb']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A novel steroidal antiandrogen targeting wild type and mutant androgen receptors.', 'Recruitment of beta-catenin by wild-type or mutant androgen receptors correlates with ligand-stimulated growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Combination of resveratrol and antiandrogen flutamide has synergistic effect on androgen receptor inhibition in prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel synthetic compound that interrupts androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The culinary-medicinal mushroom Coprinus comatus as a natural antiandrogenic modulator.', 'Computationally guided discovery of novel non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonists demonstrating potency against antiandrogen resistance.', 'Functional Comparison of Human and Zebra Fish FKBP52 Confirms the Importance of the Proline-Rich Loop for Regulation of Steroid Hormone Receptor Activity.']"""

Patients and methods:   Retrospective analysis of an institutional registry including treatment-naïve men undergoing 5-mm TTPM biopsy analysed in a 20-zone fashion. The value of three modified strategies was assessed by comparing the information provided by selected zones against full 5-mm TTPM. Strategy 1, did not consider the findings of anterior areas; strategies 2 and 3 simulated a reduced biopsy density by excluding intervening zones. A bootstrapping technique was used to calculate reliable estimates of sensitivity and NPV of these three strategies for the detection of clinically significant disease (maximum cancer core length ≥4 mm and/or Gleason score ≥3 + 4).  Results:   In all, 391 men with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 62 (58-67) years were included. The median (IQR) PSA level and PSA density were 6.9 (4.8-10) ng/mL and 0.17 (IQR 0.12-0.25) ng/mL/mL, respectively. A median (IQR) of 6 (2-9) cores out of 48 (33-63) taken per man were positive for prostate cancer. No cancer was detected in 67 men (17%), whilst low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease was identified in 78 (20%), 80 (21%), and 166 (42%), respectively. Strategy 1, 2 and 3 had sensitivities of 78% [95% confidence interval (CI) 73-84%], 85% (95% CI 80-90%) and 84% (95% CI 79-89%), respectively. The NPVs of the three strategies were 73% (95% CI 67-80%), 80% (95% CI 74-86%) and 79% (95% CI 72-84%), respectively.  Conclusion:   Altering the template or decreasing sampling density has a substantial negative impact on the ability of TTPM biopsy to exclude clinically significant disease.

There is evidence that restoring T levels to normal improves body weight, serum lipids and glucose levels.  Design:   Observational registry study.  Patients:   Two hundred and sixty-two hypogonadal, middle-aged and elderly, men received testosterone replacement treatment (TRT).

Especially the stilbenoid resveratrol has been extensively studied regarding its anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive activities. However, research has recently focused on the investigation of other natural or synthetic compounds in order to find substances that show a higher bioactivity and/or bioavailability than resveratrol. In this context, we exemplarily investigated the cytotoxic/growth-inhibiting properties of the resveratrol tetramer r-viniferin on the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and compared them with those of resveratrol. By using the sulforhodamine B assay followed by cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry and commercially available apoptosis/necrosis assay kits, we show that both compounds were able to inhibit the growth of LNCaP cells and to induce a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. However, r-viniferin was significantly more potent in inhibiting cellular growth than resveratrol and the only compound that increased the apoptotic cellular fraction as well as the activity of apoptosis-associated enzymes. In conclusion, r-viniferin leads to cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells at fairly low concentrations, and it is therefore conceivable that it might be used as a chemopreventive agent or as an adjuvant in prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Michael T Empl', 'Malena Albers', 'Shan Wang', 'Pablo Steinberg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Differential effects of resveratrol and its naturally occurring methylether analogs on cell cycle and apoptosis in human androgen-responsive LNCaP cancer cells.', 'Differential effects on growth, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis by resveratrol in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Mechanisms involved in resveratrol-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer-derived cell lines.', 'Resveratrol in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'Resveratrol and cancer: chemoprevention, apoptosis, and chemo-immunosensitizing activities.', 'Chemistry, Biosynthesis and Pharmacology of Viniferin: Potential Resveratrol-Derived Molecules for New Drug Discovery, Development and Therapy.', 'Grape Powder Supplementation Attenuates Prostate Neoplasia Associated with Pten Haploinsufficiency in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.', 'Impact of Extraction Conditions on the Phenolic Composition and Antioxidant Capacity of Grape Stem Extracts.', 'In Vitro Toxicity Assessment of Stilbene Extract for Its Potential Use as Antioxidant in the Wine Industry.', 'Vitisin B as a novel fatty acid synthase inhibitor induces human breast cancer cells apoptosis.']"""

While there is some evidence to suggest that these lesions can be related and exist on a pathological and morphological continuum, the precise clonal and temporal relationships between precursor lesions and invasive cancers within individual tumours remain undefined. Here, we used molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and histological analyses to delineate clonal, temporal, and spatial relationships between HGPIN and cancer lesions with distinct morphological and molecular features. First, while confirming the previous finding that a substantial fraction of HGPIN lesions associated with ERG-positive cancers share rearrangements and overexpression of ERG, we found that a significant subset of such HGPIN glands exhibit only partial positivity for ERG. This suggests that such ERG-positive HGPIN cells either rapidly invade to form adenocarcinoma or represent cancer cells that have partially invaded the ductal and acinar space in a retrograde manner. To clarify these possibilities, we used ERG expression status and TMPRSS2-ERG genomic breakpoints as markers of clonality, and PTEN deletion status to track temporal evolution of clonally related lesions. We confirmed that morphologically distinct HGPIN and nearby invasive cancer lesions are clonally related. Further, we found that a significant fraction of ERG-positive, PTEN-negative HGPIN and intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P) lesions are most likely clonally derived from adjacent PTEN-negative adenocarcinomas, indicating that such PTEN-negative HGPIN and IDC-P lesions arise from, rather than give rise to, the nearby invasive adenocarcinoma. These data suggest that invasive adenocarcinoma can morphologically mimic HGPIN through retrograde colonization of benign glands with cancer cells. Similar clonal relationships were also seen for intraductal carcinoma adjacent to invasive adenocarcinoma. These findings represent a potentially undervalued indicator of pre-existing invasive prostate cancer and have significant implications for prostate cancer diagnosis and risk stratification.""","""['Michael C Haffner', 'Christopher Weier', 'Meng Meng Xu', 'Ajay Vaghasia', 'Bora Gürel', 'Berrak Gümüşkaya', 'David M Esopi', 'Helen Fedor', 'Hsueh-Li Tan', 'Ibrahim Kulac', 'Jessica Hicks', 'William B Isaacs', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'William G Nelson', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['ERG and PTEN status of isolated high-grade PIN occurring in cystoprostatectomy specimens without invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'ETS gene aberrations in atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: Implications for the distinction between intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and cribriform high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Pathology of High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Leukocytic Infiltration of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: An Exploratory Study.', 'ETV4 mediates dosage-dependent prostate tumor initiation and cooperates with p53 loss to generate prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.', 'Meta-Data Analysis to Explore the Hub of the Hub-Genes That Influence SARS-CoV-2 Infections Highlighting Their Pathogenetic Processes and Drugs Repurposing.']"""

In this report, we show that MAGE-A11 is targeted for degradation by human p14-ARF, a tumor suppressor expressed from an alternative reading frame of the p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor INK4a/ARF gene. MAGE-A11 degradation by the proteasome was mediated by an interaction with p14-ARF and was independent of lysine ubiquitination. A dose-dependent inverse relationship between MAGE-A11 and p14-ARF correlated with p14-ARF inhibition of the MAGE-A11-induced increase in androgen-dependent AR transcriptional activity and constitutive activity of a splice variant-like AR. Reciprocal stabilization between MAGE-A11 and AR did not protect against degradation promoted by p14-ARF. p14-ARF prevented MAGE-A11 interaction with the E2F1 oncoprotein and inhibited the MAGE-A11-induced increase in E2F1 transcriptional activity. Post-translational down-regulation of MAGE-A11 promoted by p14-ARF was independent of HDM2, the human homologue of mouse double minute 2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibited by p14-ARF. However, MAGE-A11 had a stabilizing effect on HDM2 in the absence or presence of p14-ARF and cooperated with HDM2 to increase E2F1 transcriptional activity in the absence of p14-ARF. We conclude that degradation of MAGE-A11 promoted by the human p14-ARF tumor suppressor contributes to low levels of MAGE-A11 in nontransformed cells and that higher levels of MAGE-A11 associated with low p14-ARF increase AR and E2F1 transcriptional activity and promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['John T Minges', 'Gail Grossman', 'Ping Zhang', 'Tal Kafri', 'Elizabeth M Wilson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Proto-oncogene activity of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) regulates retinoblastoma-related p107 and E2F1 proteins.', 'Melanoma antigen-A11 regulates substrate-specificity of Skp2-mediated protein degradation.', 'Melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) enhances transcriptional activity by linking androgen receptor dimers.', 'Regulatory Network of ARF in Cancer Development.', 'Post-Translational Regulation of ARF: Perspective in Cancer.', 'Co-expression of cancer-testis antigens of MAGE-A6 and MAGE-A11 is associated with tumor aggressiveness in patients with bladder cancer.', 'Emerging roles of the MAGE protein family in stress response pathways.', 'DNA hypomethylation drives changes in MAGE-A gene expression resulting in alteration of proliferative status of cells.', 'The p14ARF tumor suppressor restrains androgen receptor activity and prevents apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'MAGE-A11 Expression Predicts Patient Prognosis in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

To answer the crucial questions raised on human reproductive health, there is an urgent need for a reproductive surveillance system to be shared across countries.  Methods:   A multidisciplinary network named HUman Reproductive health and Global ENvironment Network (HURGENT) was created aiming at designing a European monitoring system for reproductive health indicators. Collaborative work allowed setting up the available knowledge to design such a system. Furthermore we conducted an overview of 23 potential indicators, based upon a weight of evidence (WoE) approach according to their potential relation with EDC exposure.  Results:   The framework and purposes of the surveillance system are settled as well as the approach to select suitable reproductive indicators. The indicators found with the highest scores according to the WoE approach are prostate and breast cancer incidence, sex ratio, endometriosis and uterine fibroid incidence, indicators related to the testicular dysgenesis syndrome, precocious puberty incidence and reproductive hormone levels.

Methods:   In this work, 19-patient data sets were involved. To estimate structure dose for each delineated contour under the influence of interobserver contour variability and CT image quality limitations, 1000 alternative structures were simulated by an average-surface-of-standard-deviation model, which utilized the patient-specific information of delineated structure and CT image contrast. An IMRT plan with zero planning-target-volume (PTV) margin on the delineated prostate and seminal vesicles [clinical-target-volume (CTV prostate) and CTVSV] was created and dose degradation due to contour variability was quantified by the dosimetric consequences of 1000 alternative structures. When D98 failed to achieve a 95% coverage probability objective D98,95 ≥ 78 Gy (CTV prostate) or D98,95 ≥ 66 Gy (CTVSV), replanning was performed using three planning techniques: (1) FM (PTV prostate margin = 4,5,6 mm and PTVSV margin = 4,5,7 mm for RL, PA, and SI directions, respectively), (2) CPOM which optimized uniform PTV margins for CTV prostate and CTVSV to meet the D98,95 objectives, and (3) CPCOP which directly optimized coverage-based objectives for all the structures. These plans were intercompared by computing percentile dose-volume histograms and tumor-control probability/normal tissue complication probability (TCP/NTCP) distributions.  Results:   Inherent contour variability resulted in unacceptable CTV coverage for the zero-PTV-margin plans for all patients. For plans designed to accommodate contour variability, 18/19 CP plans were most favored by achieving desirable D98,95 and TCP/NTCP values. The average improvement of probability of complication free control was 9.3% for CPCOP plans and 3.4% for CPOM plans.  Conclusions:   When the delineation uncertainties need to be considered for prostate patients, CP techniques can produce more desirable plans than FM plans for most patients.

To assess potential clinical advantages, a dose calculation module accounting for relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was developed and integrated into the treatment planning system Hyperion.  Methods:   Current knowledge on RBE of (4)He together with linear energy transfer considerations motivated an empirical depth-dependent ""zonal"" RBE model. In the plateau region, a RBE of 1.0 was assumed, followed by an increasing RBE up to 2.8 at the Bragg-peak region, which was then kept constant over the fragmentation tail. To account for a variable proton RBE, the same model concept was also applied to protons with a maximum RBE of 1.6. Both RBE models were added to a previously developed pencil beam algorithm for physical dose calculation and included into the treatment planning system Hyperion. The implementation was validated against Monte Carlo simulations within a water phantom using γ-index evaluation. The potential benefits of (4)He based treatment plans were explored in a preliminary treatment planning comparison (against protons) for four treatment sites, i.e., a prostate, a base-of-skull, a pediatric, and a head-and-neck tumor case. Separate treatment plans taking into account physical dose calculation only or using biological modeling were created for protons and (4)He.  Results:   Comparison of Monte Carlo and Hyperion calculated doses resulted in a γ mean of 0.3, with 3.4% of the values above 1 and γ 1% of 1.5 and better. Treatment plan evaluation showed comparable planning target volume coverage for both particles, with slightly increased coverage for (4)He. Organ at risk (OAR) doses were generally reduced using (4)He, some by more than to 30%. Improvements of (4)He over protons were more pronounced for treatment plans taking biological effects into account. All OAR doses were within tolerances specified in the QUANTEC report.  Conclusions:   The biological (4)He model proposed above is a first approach matching biological data published so far. The advantage of (4)He seems to lie in the reduction of dose to surrounding tissue and to OARs. Nevertheless, additional biological experiments and treatment planning studies with larger patient numbers and more tumor indications are necessary to study the possible benefits of helium ion beam therapy in detail.""","""['Hermann Fuchs', 'Markus Alber', 'Thomas Schreiner', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Proton and helium ion radiotherapy for meningioma tumors: a Monte Carlo-based treatment planning comparison.', 'Can particle beam therapy be improved using helium ions? - a planning study focusing on pediatric patients.', 'Assessment of potential advantages of relevant ions for particle therapy: a model based study.', 'A comparison of mechanism-inspired models for particle relative biological effectiveness (RBE).', 'Modelling carcinogenesis after radiotherapy using Poisson statistics: implications for IMRT, protons and ions.', 'A pencil beam algorithm for magnetic resonance image-guided proton therapy.', 'Proton and helium ion radiotherapy for meningioma tumors: a Monte Carlo-based treatment planning comparison.']"""

This has formed the basis for prostate elastography imaging techniques where images of prostate tissue mechanical properties are reconstructed. In this paper, the authors present a novel prostate elastography technique which, unlike other techniques, relies on magnitude image data only.  Methods:   This proposed technique works in conjunction with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging modalities and it requires the prostate's pre- and postdeformation images as input. It uses a constrained reconstruction method where the elastic moduli of the prostate's normal and pathological tissues are determined based on an essential subset of the tissue deformation provided by the images data. The elasticity reconstruction technique uses optimization where similarity between calculated and observed shape features of the postcompression prostate image is maximized. The method was validated with an in silico phantom study followed by studies using ultrasound and MR with tissue-mimicking phantoms.  Results:   Using the proposed methods, it was observed that the maximum uncertainties of the reconstructed Young's modulus ratios of tumor to normal tissue were 15.6% and 9.7%, which were obtained from the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and MR tissue-mimicking phantom studies, respectively.  Conclusions:   This novel prostate elastography technique relies on prostate TRUS or MRI images that can be routinely acquired without additional imaging hardware. The phantom studies provided evidence that the proposed technique has a good potential to reconstruct prostate stiffness maps noninvasively particularly when applied in conjunction with MRI. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the technique's merits for clinical use.""","""['Seyed Reza Mousavi', 'Haisu Wang', 'Seyyed Mohammad Hesabgar', 'Timothy J Scholl', 'Abbas Samani']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Towards clinical prostate ultrasound elastography using full inversion approach.', 'A novel fast full inversion based breast ultrasound elastography technique.', 'Detecting mechanical abnormalities in prostate tissue using FE-based image registration.', 'Ultrasound elastography of the prostate: state of the art.', 'Diagnostic value of ultrasound elastography in prostate cancer.', 'Causal contributors to tissue stiffness and clinical relevance in urology.']"""

We recently discovered that androgen receptor blockade by the anti-androgen enzalutamide paradoxically enhanced metastasis and that these pro-metastatic effects were mediated by the chemoattractant CCL2. CCL2 is regulated by TNF, which is negatively regulated by androgen signaling. Thus, we asked if TNF mediates the pro-metastatic effects of enzalutamide. We found that androgen withdrawal or enzalutamide induced TNF mRNA and protein secretion in castration resistant prostate cancer (C4-2) cells, but not in macrophage-like (THP1) or myofibroblast-like (WPMY1) cells. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induced autocrine CCL2 expression in C4-2 (as well as a murine CRPC cell line), while exogenous TNF induced CCL2 in THP1 and WPMY1. TNF was most potent in myofibroblast cultures, suggesting ADT induces CCL2 via paracrine interactions within the tumor microenvironment. A soluble TNF receptor (etanercept) blocked enzalutamide-induced CCL2 protein secretion and mRNA, implying dependence on secreted TNF. A small molecule inhibitor of CCR2 (the CCL2 receptor) significantly reduced TNF induced migration, while etanercept inhibited enzalutamide-induced migration and invasion of C4-2. Analysis of human prostate cancers suggests that a TNF-CCL2 paracrine loop is induced in response to ADT and might account for some forms of prostate cancer therapy resistance.""","""['Kai Sha', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang', 'Kent L Nastiuk', 'John J Krolewski']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Natural killer cells suppress enzalutamide resistance and cell invasion in the castration resistant prostate cancer via targeting the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7).', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'ASC-J9(®) suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer progression via degrading the enzalutamide-induced androgen receptor mutant AR-F876L.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Healing mechanism of diabetic foot ulcers using single-cell RNA-sequencing.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.', 'Assessing the Mechanism of Action of ""Fructus Ligustri Lucidi-Cuscutae Semen"" in Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.', 'Harnessing Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha to Achieve Effective Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via altering the ATF3-PTK2 signaling.']"""

Profilin 1 with mutations at the C-terminus, transiently expressed in prostate cancer cells PC-3, showed that Tyr139 is important for proper function of profilin 1 as a tumor suppressor.

Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a promising alternative palliative thermal treatment technique for bone metastases that has been tested in a few clinical studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive pre-clinical study to investigate the effects, and efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation for the palliative treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases in rats.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cells (MATLyLu) were injected intra-osseously in Copenhagen rats. Upon detection of pain, as determined with a dynamic weight bearing (DWB) system, a MR-HIFU system was used to thermally ablate the bone region with tumor. Treatment effect and efficacy were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m medronate ((99m)Tc-MDP), micro-computed tomography (μCT) and histology.  Results:   DWB analysis demonstrated that MR-HIFU-treated animals retained 58.6 ± 20.4% of limb usage as compared to 2.6 ± 6.3% in untreated animals (P=0.003). MR-HIFU delayed tumor specific growth rates (SGR) from 29 ± 6 to 13 ± 5%/day (P<0.001).

In the current study, we examined whether soluble factors derived from granulocytes, such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and arginase 1 (ARG1), and inhibitory cytokine TGFβ in pre-vaccination plasma were useful for predicting prognosis after PPV in advanced cancer patients. In biliary tract cancer (n=25), multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients with higher plasma MMP-9 levels had a significantly worse overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.637, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.670 - 12.877, P = 0.003], whereas MPO, ARG1, or TGFβ levels were not correlated with OS. Similarly, patients with higher MMP-9 levels showed worse prognosis than those with lower MMP-9 levels in other types of advanced cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (n=32, P = 0.037 by log-rank test), and pancreatic cancer (n=41, P = 0.042 by log-rank test).

Methods:   Curative intervention was recommended for disease reclassification to higher cancer grade or volume on prostate biopsy. Primary outcomes were overall, cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of reclassification and curative intervention. Factors associated with grade reclassification and curative intervention were evaluated in a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   A total of 1,298 men (median age, 66 years) with a median follow-up of 5 years (range, 0.01 to 18.00 years) contributed 6,766 person-years of follow-up since 1995. Overall, cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival rates were 93%, 99.9%, and 99.4%, respectively, at 10 years and 69%, 99.9%, and 99.4%, respectively, at 15 years. The cumulative incidence of grade reclassification was 26% at 10 years and was 31% at 15 years; cumulative incidence of curative intervention was 50% at 10 years and was 57% at 15 years. The median treatment-free survival was 8.5 years (range, 0.01 to 18 years). Factors associated with grade reclassification were older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 for each additional year; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.06), prostate-specific antigen density (HR, 1.21 per 0.1 unit increase; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.46), and greater number of positive biopsy cores (HR, 1.47 for each additional positive core; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.69). Factors associated with intervention were prostate-specific antigen density (HR, 1.38 per 0.1 unit increase; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.56) and a greater number of positive biopsy cores (HR, 1.35 for one additional positive core; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.53).

Briefly, lentivirus‑mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was designed specifically to silence myosin VI in A375 and A431 cell lines. Expression levels of myosin VI were then analyzed in the two cell lines by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Cell viability was assessed using MTT and colony formation assays. In addition, the cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that knockdown of myosin VI significantly suppressed melanoma cell viability and proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to assess the role of myosin VI in the growth of melanoma. Knowledge of the underlying mechanism of the role myosin VI in skin cancer cells may aid in the development of novel methods of melanoma diagnosis and therapy in the future.""","""['Hui Li', 'Fusheng Zhou', 'Hongyan Wang', 'Da Lin', 'Gang Chen', 'Xianbo Zuo', 'Liangdan Sun', 'Xuejun Zhang', 'Sen Yang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Knockdown of EIF3D suppresses proliferation of human melanoma cells through G2/M phase arrest.', 'RNAi-mediated human Nestin silence inhibits proliferation and migration of malignant melanoma cells by G1/S arrest via Akt-GSK3β-Rb pathway.', 'Knockdown of Myosin VI Inhibits Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells In Vitro.', 'RNAi-mediated downregulation of CDKL1 inhibits growth and colony-formation ability, promotes apoptosis of human melanoma cells.', 'Lentivirus-Mediated Knockdown of Myosin VI Inhibits Cell Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cell.', 'Targeting the cytoskeleton against metastatic dissemination.', 'Cytoskeletal Remodeling in Cancer.', 'Induction of G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDK2 in A375 melanocytes.', 'Myosins as fundamental components during tumorigenesis: diverse and indispensable.']"""

Post-implant dosimetry based on day 30 CT-scan and multiparametric MRI co-registration was generated: planned D90, D95, V100, V150 values were calculated for each DIL. Bounce was defined as a PSA elevation ⩾ 0.2 ng/mL from the previous baseline value followed by a decrease to or below the prior nadir with no additional treatment.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 35.5 months (range 13.2-72.5), a PSA bounce occurred in 24 (36.4%) patients. The mean planned D90 of the DIL was significantly lower in bouncers: 196 ± 61 Gy vs. 234 ± 62 Gy, p = 0.018.

The authors wondered whether common radiological and clinical patterns shared by various types of pelvic cancer exist. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed their institutional series of 17 cases concluded as perineural tumor spread. All available history, physical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, biopsy data and imaging studies, evidence of other metastatic disease, and follow-up were recorded in detail. The series was divided into 2 groups: cases with neoplastic lumbosacral plexopathy confirmed by biopsy (Group A) and cases included based on imaging characteristics despite the lack of biopsy or negative biopsy results (Group B). RESULTS Group A comprised 10 patients (mean age 69 years); 9 patients were symptomatic and 1 was asymptomatic. The L5-S1 spinal nerves and sciatic nerve were most frequently involved. Three patients had intradural extension. Seven patients were alive at last follow-up. Group B consisted of 7 patients (mean age 64 years); 4 patients were symptomatic, 2 were asymptomatic, and 1 had only imaging available. The L5-S1 spinal nerves and the sciatic nerve were most frequently involved. No patients had intradural extension. Four patients were alive at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The authors provide a unifying theory to explain lumbosacral plexopathy in select cases of various pelvic neoplasms. The tumor cells can use splanchnic nerves as conduits and spread from the end organ to the lumbosacral plexus. Tumor can continue to spread along osseous and muscle nerve branches, resulting in muscle and bone ""metastases.""

The yield of these procedures rarely achieves more than 50%. In selected cases where preoperative evaluation points toward a more localized (usually a more proximal) process, targeted biopsy would likely capture the disease. Synthesis of data obtained from clinical examination, electrophysiological testing, and MRI allows biopsy of a portion of the major mixed nerves safely and efficiently. Herein, experiences with the sciatic nerve are reported and a description of the operative technique is provided. METHODS All cases of sciatic nerve biopsy performed between 2000 and 2014 were reviewed. Only cases of fascicular nerve biopsy approached from the buttock or the posterior aspect of the thigh were included. Demographic data, clinical presentation, and the presence of percussion tenderness for each patient were recorded. Reviewed studies included electrodiagnostic tests and imaging. Previous nerve and muscle biopsies were noted. All details of the procedure, final pathology, and its treatment implications were recorded. The complication rate was carefully assessed for temporary as well as permanent complications. RESULTS One hundred twelve cases (63 men and 49 women) of sciatic nerve biopsy were performed. Mean patient age was 46.4 years. Seventy-seven (68.8%) patients presented with single lower-extremity symptoms, 16 (14.3%) with bilateral lower-extremity symptoms, and 19 (17%) with generalized symptoms. No patient had normal findings on physical examination. All patients underwent electrodiagnostic studies, the findings of which were abnormal in 110 (98.2%) patients. MRI was available for all patients and was read as pathological in 111 (99.1%). The overall diagnostic yield of biopsy was 84.8% (n = 95). The pathological diagnoses included inflammatory demyelination, perineurioma, nonspecific inflammatory changes, neurolymphomatosis, amyloidosis, prostate cancer, injury neuroma, neuromuscular choristoma, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, hemangiomatosis, arteriovenous malformation, fibrolipomatous hamartoma (lipomatosis of nerve), and cervical adenocarcinoma. The series included 11 (9.9%) temporary and 5 (4.5%) permanent complications: 3 patients (2.7%) reported permanent numbness in the peroneal division distribution, and 2 patients (1.8%) were diagnosed with neuromuscular choristoma that developed desmoid tumor at the biopsy site 3 and 8 years later. CONCLUSIONS Targeted fascicular biopsy of the sciatic nerve is a safe and efficient diagnostic procedure, and in highly selected cases can be offered as the initial procedure over distal cutaneous nerve biopsy. Diagnoses were very diverse and included entities considered very rare. Even for the more prevalent diagnoses, the biopsy technique allowed a more targeted approach with a higher diagnostic yield and justification for more aggressive treatment. In this series, new radiological patterns of some entities were identified, which could be biopsied less frequently.""","""['Stepan Capek', 'Kimberly K Amrami', 'P James B Dyck', 'Robert J Spinner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neurosurg Focus""","""['Targeted fascicular biopsy of the brachial plexus: rationale and operative technique.', 'Pediatric Nerve Biopsy Diagnostic and Treatment Utility in\xa0Tertiary Care Referral.', 'Clinicopathological features of neuropathy associated with lymphoma.', 'Long-term natural history of a neuromuscular choristoma of the sciatic nerve: a case report and literature review.', 'Practice Parameter: evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: role of autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy (an evidence-based review).

Methods:   Inclusion criteria were (a) proven mCRPC, (b) docetaxel as first line of chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) + prednisone 5 mg), and (c) (11)C-choline PET/CT and PSA values assessed before and after docetaxel administration. A total of 61 patients were retrospectively enrolled (mean age 68.9 years, range 57 - 84 years). (11)C-Choline PET/CT was performed at baseline before docetaxel treatment (PET1) and after the end of treatment (PET2). PSA values were measured before treatment (PSA1) and after treatment (PSA2). PET2 was reported as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Progressive disease (PD) was considered if a new lesion was seen. PSA trend was calculated from the change in absolute values between PSA1 and PSA2. A decrease of ≥50 % between PSA1 and PSA2 was considered a PSA response. Clinical, radiological and laboratory follow-up ranged from 6 to 53 months (mean 13.5 months).  Results:   Of the 61 patients, 40 (65.5 %) showed PD on PET2, 13 (21.3 %) showed SD, 2 (3.4 %) showed PR, and 6 (9.8 %) showed CR. An increasing PSA trend was seen in 29 patients (47.5 %) and a decreasing PSA trend in 32 patients (52.5 %). A PSA response of ≥50 % was seen in 25 patients (41 %). Radiological PD was seen in 23 of the 29 patients (79.3 %) with an increasing PSA trend, in 16 of the 32 patients (50 %) with a decreasing PSA trend, and in 11 of the 25 patients (44 %) with a PSA response of ≥50 %. In the multivariate statistical analysis, the presence of more than ten bone lesions detected on PET1 was significantly associated with an increased probability of PD on PET2. No association was observed between PSA level and PD on PET2.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that an increasing PSA trend measured after docetaxel treatment could be considered predictive of PD. In patients with decreasing PSA values (decreasing PSA trend and a PSA response of ≥50 %), (11)C-choline PET/CT may be useful to identify those with radiological progression despite a PSA response. Finally, the tumour burden, expressed as number of bone lesions on PET1, is significantly associated with an increased probability of PD on PET2.""","""['Francesco Ceci', 'Paolo Castellucci', 'Tiziano Graziani', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Riccardo Renzi', 'Marco Borghesi', 'Piergiorgio Di Tullio', 'Eugenio Brunocilla', 'Andrea Ardizzoni', 'Stefano Fanti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Assessment of the role of Ga-68 PSMA I&T PET/CT in response evaluation to docetaxel therapy in castration resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Prospective evaluation of 11CCholine PET/CT in therapy response assessment of standardized docetaxel first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced castration refractory prostate cancer.', '(18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for early response assessment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide.', 'Radiographic paradoxical response in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) managed with new generation anti-androgens: a retrospective analysis.', 'Prognostic role of 11C-choline PET/CT scan in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer undergoing primary docetaxel chemotherapy.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'Status of 18F-PSMA-1007-PET/CT compared with multiparametric MRI in preoperative evaluation of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA and Choline PET for the Assessment of Response to Therapy and Survival Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review from the Literature.', 'Response Assessment and Prediction of Progression-Free Survival by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Based on Tumor-to-Liver Ratio (TLR) in Patients with mCRPC Undergoing 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Combined bone scintigraphy and fluorocholine PET/computed tomography predicts response to radium-223 therapy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

The maximum androgen blockage group experienced longer biochemical recurrence-free survival (P = 0.004) compared with the bicalutamide 150 mg group. Side-effects in the two groups were similar and could be moderately tolerated in all patients.

Cell proliferation, apoptosis and caspase-9 activities were assessed in DU145 after HAX-1 siRNA treatment. The mRNA and protein levels of HAX-1 in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, VCaP and DU145 were significantly higher than those in the primary prostate epithelial cells, and DU145 possess the highest mRNA and protein levels compared to PC-3 and VCaP. When HAX-1 was knocked down in DU145, cell proliferation was significantly decreased, accompanied by a decrease in Ki67 protein expression. Compared with the control and control siRNA groups, HAX-1 siRNA promoted cell apoptosis and caspase-9 activation in DU145. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells co-transfected with HAX-1 and caspase-9 promoted viability and reduced apoptosis.

Material and methods:   44 male patients (age 63.9 ± 8.9 years) with clinically suspected prostate cancer underwent DCE-MRI at a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a CDT-VIBE sequence (spatial resolution=3×1.2×1.2mm(3), temporal resolution=5s, total scan duration=4:10 min) with body-weight-adapted administration of contrast agent (Gadobutrol, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). To investigate effects on image quality, the same sequence was acquired three times per patient during the late phase: 1. with the same protocol as in the arterial phase (VS5), 2. without view-sharing (no view-sharing, NVS) using a 2-fold CAIPIRINHA acceleration R=2 (temporal resolution=15s, NVS15) and 3. NVS using a 6-fold CAIPIRINHA acceleration R=6 (temporal resolution=5s, NVS5). SNR and CNR were evaluated with the subtraction method. Image quality of the three sequences (VS5, NVS15, NVS5) was subjectively assessed by 2 blinded radiologists using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being excellent). Perfusion profiles of visually normal prostate and of malignant lesions as characterized by Wash-In, Wash-Out, time-to-peak (TTP) and initial area under the curve (iAUC) from the original datasets (temporal resolution=5s) and from datasets with a downsampled temporal resolution (15s) were compared.  Results:   In 20 of 44 included patients, potentially malignant lesions were identified in which 16 had histologically confirmed prostate cancer. SNR was highest for VS5 and NVS15, and lowest for NVS5 (p <.001). Concordantly, subjective image quality was comparable for VS5 and NVS15 (sum score 23.20 ± 1.03 vs 23.53 ± 1.34) and significantly lower for NVS5 (sum score 9.83 ± 2.32; p<.001). Perfusion parameters of macroscopically normal prostate tissue and suspect lesions differed significantly between original datasets and datasets with simulated lower temporal resolution, with the latter showing higher Wash-In (p=.002), lower Wash-Out (p=.003), higher Time-to-Peak (p<.001) and lower iAUC (p<.001).

A single center longitudinal study (2005-2014) was carried out to prospectively characterize inpatients with manifest ONJ and to evaluate their outcomes. The data recorded were: medical history, bisphosphonate treatment, localization, imaging, treatment, histomorphological features, and complications. A prognostic score (modified UCONN-Score) was adopted to predict outcomes. Eighty patients were included (mean age 69.4 years; 40 male, 40 female). Breast cancer (n = 25), multiple myeloma (n = 16), and prostate cancer (n = 15) were the three most common malignancies; and cardiovascular disease (n = 31), diabetes mellitus (16), and renal disorders (6) were the most important comorbidities. The severity of ONJ was stage I in three patients, stage II in 37, and stage III in 40, being predominantly localized in the posterior mandible and needing gradual resection. The average duration of bisphosphonate treatment was 38.3 months. The typical histological aspects of ONJ were predominantly osteonecrosis, bone marrow fibrosis, and bacterial colonization (Actinomyces) with suppurative inflammation. Within the resected jawbone a primary malignancy was diagnosed in two cases. The overall success rate was 83.6% (follow-up 23.5 months), with a UCONN-Score ≥15 predicting unfavorable treatment results (OR = 5.2). The past decade has enhanced experience with ONJ treatment and knowledge about its pathogenesis, which seems to be a multistep process. This study demonstrates the importance of bone and multilayer soft tissue management, preferably as an early intervention. The UCONN-Score might help to assess individual prognosis in ONJ surgery and the potential benefit of an antiresorptive drug holiday.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of unnecessary biopsy cases in patients referred for prostate biopsy in one of the most important and overload cancer centers in Syria.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective data for a period of four years between January 2009 and December 2012 were collected in Al- Bayrouni University Medical hospital in Damascus, Syria. The patients from whom data were collected were referred to our histopathological department because of elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). All patients underwent prostatic TRUS-guided biopsies. Diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was based on histopathological examination and prostate cancers cases were graded and scored according to the Gleason score system.  Results:   For the 406 patients referred to biopsy, the mean±SD age was 58.4 ±23.3 years. The mean ± SD PSA level was 49.2±21.5 ng/ ml. Of the total we found 237 patients diagnosed with PCa (58. 4%), 166 patients with BPH (40.9%) and 3 cases were unable to be diagnosed (0.7%) because of biopsy collection errors.  Conclusions:   Our study shows that a high percentage of patients are undergoing unnecessary biopsy, which suggests that the performed screening tests had a high level of false positive and may need re-evaluation.""","""['Dala-Maria Bachour', 'Emil Chahin', 'Sahar Al-Fahoum']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Prognostic significance of prostate-specific antigen in defining indications for initial prostate biopsy.', 'Detection of prostate cancer and changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) six months after surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with elevated PSA.', 'Early diagnosis of prostate cancer in the Western Cape.', 'Status of PSA determination for early detection of prostate carcinoma.', 'The association of benign prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate.']"""

Reported standardized incidence rates are 12.6, 61.7, 11.9 and 27.9 in Iran, developed countries, developing countries and the entire world, respectively. The present study investigated the relative risk of PC in Iran at the province level and also explored the impact of some factors by the use of Bayesian models.  Materials and methods:   Our study population was all men with PC in Iran from 2005 to 2008. Considered risk factors were smoking, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, obesity and human development index. We used empirical and full Bayesian models to study the relative risk in Iran at province level to estimate the risk of PC more accurately.  Results:   In Iran from 2005 to 2008 the total number of known PC cases was 10,361 with most cases found in Fars and Tehran and the least in Ilam. In all models just human development index was found to be significantly related to PC risk Conclusions: In the unadjusted model, Fars, Semnam, Isfahan and Tehran provinces have the highest and Sistan-and-Baluchestan has the least risk of PC. In general, central provinces have high risk. After adjusting for covariates, Fars and Zanjan provinces have the highest relative risk and Kerman, Northern Khorasan, Kohgiluyeh Boyer Ahmad, Ghazvin and Kermanshah have the lowest relative risk.

We investigated whether finasteride was associated with a reduced incidence of BCa as observed by self-report in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to determine the association of finasteride use with time to diagnosis of BCa, controlling for age and tobacco use. Of the 72,370 male participants who met inclusion criteria, 6069 (8.4%) had reported the use of finasteride. BCa was diagnosed in 1.07% (65 of 6069) of those who reported finasteride compared with 1.46% (966 of 66,301) of those who reported no use during the trial. In a multiple Cox regression analysis, self-reported use of finasteride was associated with a decreased risk of development of BCa (hazard ratio: 0.634; 95% confidence interval, 0.493-0.816; p=0.0004), controlling for age and smoking. Limitations of this study include that it is observational and not randomized, that many of the confounding variables for BCa, such as alcohol use, were not available for use in the analysis, and that finasteride use was by annual self-report, which is subject to missing values and error.  Patient summary:   Finasteride is a common medication used to reduce the size of the prostate and to promote hair growth by manipulating testosterone in men.

A preliminary result""","""Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the orexin receptor in different prostate pathologies, including prostate adenocarcinoma, benign prostate hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis.  Material and methods:   A total of 90 patients (mean age 64.01±7.2 years) were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into three groups of equal numbers based on their histopathologic findings: prostate cancer (Group 1), benign prostate hyperplasia (Group 2) and chronic prostatitis (Group 3). All the tissues were incubated with a primary antibody recognizing the Orexin receptor. The specific cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of the Orexin receptor was semiquantitatively scored for intensity and distribution based on a grading scale. The staining intensity and orexin expression were evaluated using Pearson χ(2) test.  Results:   A heterogeneous staining pattern of the Orexin receptor was observed between the groups. The expression rates were 90% (27/30) in Group 1, 53.3% (16/30) in Group 2 and 26.7% (8/30) in Group 3. While 5 patients (9.3%) in Group 1 showed strong staining, all samples from the other 2 groups showed only weak staining. There were significant differences in staining intensity between the three groups. The expression and distribution of the Orexin receptor was more widespread in Group 1 than in the other groups and was higher in patients with poorly differentiated malignancy. However, there was no significant difference based on Gleason score.  Conclusion:   Orexin receptors are found in human prostate tissues and their expression is widespread in prostate cancer and in patients with a higher Gleason score. Therefore, we believe that Orexin immunoreactivity can be considered to be an indicator of poor prognosis and of poorly differentiated prostate cancer cases.""","""['Murad Mehmet Başar', 'Ünsal Han', 'Murat Çakan', 'Serhan Alpcan', 'Halil Başar']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Turk J Urol""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of Ets-related gene-transcriptional factor in adenocarcinoma prostate and its correlation with Gleason score.', 'SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'Androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer lymph node metastases is predictive of outcome after surgery.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', ""A review of orexin's unprecedented potential as a novel, highly-specific treatment for various localized and metastatic cancers."", 'Elevated Expression of Ox2R in Cervical Cancers and Placentas of Uyghur Women in Xinjiang, China.']"""

One exception is the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), originally developed and empirically validated in French. The present study validated the English version of the FCRI.  Methods:   The FCRI was translated into English using a forward-backward translation procedure and pilot-tested with 17 English-speaking cancer patients. Cross-cultural equivalency of the French and English versions was established by administering both forms to 42 bilingual cancer patients. Last, 350 English-speaking breast, colon, prostate, or lung cancer patients were asked to complete the FCRI. A subsample (n = 135) was mailed the FCRI again one month later to evaluate test-retest reliability.  Results:   The English translation of the FCRI was well accepted by participants. There was no item-bias when comparing bilingual participants' answers on both versions. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized seven-factor structure. The English version has high internal consistency (α = .96 for the total scale and .71-.94 for the subscales) and test-retest reliability (r = .88 for the total scale and 56-.87 for the subscales).

We previously identified HOXC11 to be an indicator of poor response to hormonal therapy in breast cancer. In this study we aimed to elucidate genes regulated by HOXC11 in the endocrine resistant setting.  Methods:   RNA-sequencing paired with transcription factor motif-mapping was utilised to identify putative HOXC11 target genes in endocrine resistant breast cancer. Validation and functional evaluation of the target gene, prosaposin (PSAP), was performed in a panel of endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell lines. The clinical significance of this finding was explored in clinical cohorts at both mRNA and protein level.  Results:   PSAP was shown to be regulated by HOXC11 in both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistant cell lines. Transcript levels of HOXC11 and PSAP correlated strongly in samples of primary breast tumours (r = 0.7692, n = 51). PSAP has previously been reported to activate androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. In a panel of breast cancer cell lines it was shown that endocrine resistant cells exhibit innately elevated levels of AR compared to their endocrine sensitive counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation with PSAP can drive AR recruitment to a hormone response element (HRE) in AI resistant breast cancer cells. Functionally, PSAP promotes cell migration and invasion only in AI resistant cells and not in their endocrine sensitive counterparts. In a cohort of breast cancer patients (n = 34), elevated serum levels of PSAP were found to associate significantly with poor response to endocrine treatment (p = 0.04). Meta-analysis of combined PSAP and AR mRNA are indicative of poor disease-free survival in endocrine treated breast cancer patients (hazard ratio (HR): 2.2, P = 0.0003, n = 661).  Conclusion:   The HOXC11 target gene, PSAP, is an AR activator which facilitates adaptation to a more invasive phenotype in vitro. These findings have particular relevance to the development of resistance to AI therapy which is an emerging clinical issue. PSAP is a secreted biomarker which has potential in identifying patients failing to exhibit sustained response to hormonal treatment.""","""['Azlena Ali', 'Laura Creevey', 'Yuan Hao', 'Damian McCartan', ""Peadar O'Gaora"", 'Arnold Hill', 'Leonie Young', 'Marie McIlroy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['TSC22D1 and PSAP predict clinical outcome of tamoxifen treatment in patients with recurrent breast cancer.', 'Prosaposin is an AR-target gene and its neurotrophic domain upregulates AR expression and activity in prostate stromal cells.', 'MicroRNA-125b upregulation confers aromatase inhibitor resistance and is a novel marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'The development, application and limitations of breast cancer cell lines to study tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor resistance.', 'Endocrine therapy and other targeted therapies for metastatic breast cancer.', 'N-Glycoproteomics Study of Putative N-Glycoprotein Biomarkers of Drug Resistance in MCF-7/ADR Cells.', 'HOXC11 drives lung adenocarcinoma progression through transcriptional regulation of SPHK1.', 'Glioblastoma microenvironment contains multiple hormonal and non-hormonal growth-stimulating factors.', 'HOXC11 positively regulates the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR and is associated with poor prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Steroid Ligands, the Forgotten Triggers of Nuclear Receptor Action; Implications for Acquired Resistance to Endocrine Therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We measured tumor volume in 414 consecutive radical prostatectomies from men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network(®) low risk prostate cancer (348 Caucasian, 66 African-American) who had Gleason score 3+3=6 disease at radical prostatectomy. We then compared clinical presentation, pathological findings, prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and prostate specific antigen mass (an absolute amount of prostate specific antigen in patient's circulation) between African-American and Caucasian men. The t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum were used for comparison of means.  Results:   African-American and Caucasian men had similar clinical findings based on age, body mass index and prostate specific antigen. There were no statistically significant differences between the dominant tumor nodule volume and total tumor volume (mean 0.712 vs 0.665 cm(3), p=0.695) between African-American and Caucasian men. Prostates were heavier in African-American men (mean 55.4 vs 46.3 gm, p <0.03). Despite the significantly greater weight of benign prostate tissue contributing to prostate specific antigen in African-American men, prostate specific antigen mass was not different from that of Caucasian men (mean 0.55 vs 0.558 μg, p=0.95). Prostate specific antigen density was significantly less in African-American men due to larger prostates (mean 0.09 vs 0.105, p <0.02).  Conclusions:   African-American men with Gleason score 3+3=6 prostate cancer produce less prostate specific antigen than Caucasian men. African-American and Caucasian men had equal serum prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen mass despite significantly larger prostates in African-American men with all other parameters, particularly total tumor volume, being the same. This finding has practical implications in T1c cases diagnosed with prostate cancer due to prostate specific antigen screening.

However, targeting VEGF as an anti-cancer therapeutic approach has shown success for some tumor types but not others. Here we examine the expression of the expanded VEGF family in prostate cancer, including the Semaphorin (Sema) family members that compete with VEGFs for Neuropilin binding and can themselves have pro- or anti-angiogenic activity.  Results:   First, we used multivariate statistical methods, including partial least squares and clustering, to examine VEGF/Sema gene expression variability in previously published prostate cancer microarray datasets. We show that unlike some cancers, such as kidney cancer, primary prostate cancer is characterized by both a down-regulation of the pro-angiogenic members of the VEGF family and a down-regulation of anti-angiogenic members of the Sema family. We found pro-lymphangiogenic signatures, including the genes encoding VEGFC and VEGFD, associated with primary tumors that ultimately became aggressive. In contrast to primary prostate tumors, prostate cancer metastases showed increased expression of key pro-angiogenic VEGF family members and further repression of anti-angiogenic class III Sema family members. Given the lack of success of VEGF-targeting molecules so far in prostate cancer, this suggests that the reduction in anti-angiogenic Sema signaling may potentiate VEGF signaling and even promote resistance to VEGF-targeting therapies. Inhibition of the VEGF 'accelerator' may need to be accompanied by promotion of the Sema 'brake' to block cancer angiogenesis. To leverage our mechanistic understanding, and to link multigene expression changes to outcomes, we performed individualized computational simulations of competitive VEGF and Sema receptor binding across many tumor samples. The simulations suggest that loss of Sema expression promotes angiogenesis by lowering plexin signaling, not by potentiating VEGF signaling via relaxation of competition.  Conclusions:   The combined analysis of bioinformatic data with computational modeling of ligand-receptor interactions demonstrated that enhancement of angiogenesis in prostate cancer metastases may occur through two different routes: elevation of VEGFA and reduction of class 3 Semaphorins. Therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis in metastatic prostate cancer should account for both of these routes.""","""['R Joseph Bender', 'Feilim Mac Gabhann']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Stage-specific characterization of the vascular endothelial growth factor axis in prostate cancer: expression of lymphangiogenic markers is associated with advanced-stage disease.', 'Semaphorin-plexin signalling genes associated with human breast tumourigenesis.', 'Semaphorin 4D expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome in cervical cancer patients.', 'Role of class 3 semaphorins and their receptors in tumor growth and angiogenesis.', 'VEGFs and receptors involved in angiogenesis versus lymphangiogenesis.', 'A correlative study between IVIM-DWI parameters and VEGF and MMPs expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Axl and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors Exhibit Variations in Membrane Localization and Heterogeneity Across Monolayer and Spheroid High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Models.', 'Therapeutic targets and signaling pathways of active components of QiLing decoction against castration-resistant prostate cancer based on network pharmacology.', 'Identification of Potential Key Genes in Prostate Cancer with Gene Expression, Pivotal Pathways and Regulatory Networks Analysis Using Integrated Bioinformatics Methods.', 'Inhibition of Metastatic Hepatocarcinoma by Combined Chemotherapy with Silencing VEGF/VEGFR2 Genes through a GalNAc-Modified Integrated Therapeutic System.']"""

We evaluated the clinical utility of the preoperative NLR, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) as a risk stratification tool for patients with low-risk PCa.  Materials and methods:   We identified 217 low-risk PCa patients with preoperative hematologic data who had met the criteria for active surveillance but had undergone robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at our institution from 2006 to 2015. Logistic regression models were constructed to determine whether the baseline NLR, ANC, and ALC were associated with upstaging, upgrading, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, a higher prostate-specific antigen level (odds ratio [OR], 1.554; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.148-2.104), a greater number of positive cores (OR, 2.098; 95% CI, 1.043-2.104), and a higher ALC (OR, 4.311; 95% CI, 1.258-14.770) were associated with upstaging. More importantly, the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in the high ANC group (ANC > 4.0 × 10(9)/L) compared with that of the low ANC group (P = .011). The NLR was not associated with upstaging, upgrading, or BCR in our study cohort (P = .368, P = .573, and P = .504, respectively). The only significant association with upgrading was patient age (OR, 1.106; 95% CI, 1.043-1.173).  Conclusion:   NLR was not useful in predicting adverse pathologic outcomes in our patients with low-risk PCa. However, relative neutrophilia and lymphocytosis might indicate an early manifestation of harboring a more aggressive PCa.""","""['Young Suk Kwon', 'Christopher Sejong Han', 'Ji Woong Yu', 'Sinae Kim', 'Parth Modi', 'Rachel Davis', 'Ji Hae Park', 'Paul Lee', 'Yun-Sok Ha', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio: A Predictor of Advanced Prostate Cancer and Biochemical Recurrence in Patients Receiving Radical Prostatectomy.', 'High preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predicts biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Neutrophil, Platelets, and Eosinophil to Lymphocyte Ratios Predict Gleason Score Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Prognostic significance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in prostate cancer: evidence from 16,266 patients.', 'Prognostic Role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Improving the Post-Operative Prediction of BCR-Free Survival Time with mRNA Variables and Machine Learning.', 'Intratumoral immune heterogeneity of prostate cancer characterized by typing and hub genes.', 'The Values of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The Values of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in the Localized Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia: A Retrospective Clinical Study.']"""

The aim of this study was to explore the interplay between domains of patient- reported outcomes (PROs) on GI morbidity, and to what extent these are explained by RT dose to the GI tract.  Material and methods:   The study included men from two Scandinavian studies (N = 211/277) who had undergone primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for localized prostate cancer to 70-78 Gy (2 Gy/fraction). Factor analysis was applied to previously identified PRO-based symptom domains from two study-specific questionnaires. Number of questions: 43; median time to follow-up: 3.6-6.4 years) and dose-response outcome variables were defined from these domains. Dose/volume parameters of the anal sphincter (AS) or the rectum were tested as predictors for each outcome variable using logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) and model frequency.  Results:   Outcome variables from Defecation urgency (number of symptoms: 2-3), Fecal leakage (4-6), Mucous (4), and Pain (3-6) were defined. In both cohorts, intermediate rectal doses predicted Defecation urgency (mean Az: 0.53-0.54; Frequency: 70-75%), and near minimum and low AS doses predicted Fecal leakage (mean Az: 0.63-0.67; Frequency: 83-99%). In one cohort, high AS doses predicted Mucous (mean Az: 0.54; Frequency: 96%), whereas in the other, low AS doses and intermediate rectal doses predicted Pain (mean Az: 0.69; Frequency: 28-82%).  Conclusion:   We have demonstrated that Defecation urgency, Fecal leakage, Mucous, and Pain following primary EBRT for localized prostate cancer primarily are predicted by intermediate rectal doses, low AS doses, high AS doses, or a combination of low AS and intermediate rectal doses, respectively. This suggests that there is a domain-specific dose-response for the GI tract.

Exogenous overexpression of PCGEM1 inhibited apoptosis, induced autophagy, and stimulated the proliferation of human synoviocytes. The increased expression of PCGEM1 in human synoviocytes also suppressed the expression of miR-770.

In this study we propose a new algorithm called proximity disease similarity algorithm (ProSim), which takes both of the aforementioned properties into consideration, to prioritize disease genes. To illustrate the proposed algorithm, we have conducted six case studies, namely, prostate cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer.

Besides having potential therapeutic value, this glycoprotein has recently been proposed as a molecular marker for several types of cancer. Although the mechanisms of cancer development and the improvement found with botulinum treatment are not well understood, the formation of the botulinum-SV2 complex may influence the presence and distribution of SV2 and the function of vesicles. To date, there are no reports on the possible effect of botulinum on breast cancer of unknown causes, which have a great impact on women's health. Thus we determined the presence of SV2 in three breast cancer cell lines and the alterations found with botulinum application.  Materials and methods:   With and without adding 10 units of botulinum, SV2 protein expression was determined by optical densitometry in T47D, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines and the distribution of SV2 was observed with immunochemistry (hematoxylin staining).  Results:   The SV2 protein was abundant in the cancer cells herein tested, and maximally so in T47D. In all three cancer cell lines botulinum diminished SV2 expression, which was found mostly in the cell periphery.  Conclusion:   SV2 could be a molecular marker in breast cancer. Its expression and distribution is regulated by botulinum, suggesting an interesting control mechanism for SV2 expression and a possible alternative therapy.

Methods:   A series of 128 cases with PCa were evaluated for both tissue and serum levels of miR-128 expression by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.  Results:   Compared with non-cancerous prostate tissues and normal sera, both tissue and serum levels of miR-128 expression were significantly decreased in PCa patients (both P<0.001). Importantly, there was a close correlation between tissue and serum levels of miR-128 expression in PCa patients (rs=0.808, P<0.001). Then, low miR-128 expression in both PCa tissues and patients' sera were dramatically associated with aggressive clinicopathological features, including advanced pathological stage (both P=0.001), positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.006 and 0.01, respectively), high preoperative PSA (both P=0.01) and positive angiolymphatic invasion (both P=0.02). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that low miR-128 expression in both PCa tissues and patients' sera were significantly associated with short biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that both tissue and serum levels of miR-128 expression were independent prognostic factors for BCR-free survival of PCa patients.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that the decreased expression of miR-128 in both tissue and serum samples of PCa patients may be associated with tumor malignant progression and BCR-free survival.

These results suggested that ABO blood type might influence efficacy. Unfortunately, blood types were not available in the clinical records for all but 8 patients and insufficient amounts of sera were left for standard blood typing methods.

The method requires only 4 μL of serum, provides 97% accuracy, and allows simultaneous profiling of many other serum anti-glycan antibodies. After validation with 220 healthy subjects of known blood type, the method was then applied to 74 PROSTVAC-VF patients and 37 control patients from a phase II trial. In this retrospective study, we found that type B and O PROSTVAC-VF patients demonstrated markedly improved clinical outcomes relative to A and AB patients, including longer median survival, longer median survival relative to Halabi predicted survival, and improved overall survival via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p = 0.006).

In a recent animal model, tumour susceptibility was transmitted using faecal transplantation. Our aim was to evaluate possible association between antibiotic exposure and cancer risk.  Methods:   We conducted nested case-control studies for 15 common malignancies using a large population-based electronic medical record database. Cases were defined as those with any medical code for the specific malignancy. Individuals with familial cancer syndromes were excluded. For every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice site and duration of follow-up before index-date were selected using incidence-density sampling. Exposure of interest was antibiotic therapy >1 year before index-date. Adjusted odds-ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each antibiotic type using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   125,441 cases and 490,510 matched controls were analysed. For gastro-intestinal malignancies, the use of penicillin was associated with an elevated risk of oesophageal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. The association increased with the number of antibiotic courses and reached 1.4 for gastric cancers associated with >5 courses of penicillin (95% CI 1.2-1.8). Lung cancer risk increased with the use of penicillin, cephalosporins, or macrolides (AOR for >5 courses of penicillin: 1.4 95% CI 1.3-1.6). The risk of prostate cancer increased modestly with the use of penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides and tetracyclines. The risk of breast cancer was modestly associated with exposure to sulphonamides. There was no association between the use of anti-virals and anti-fungals and cancer risk.

However, we argued that patients with greater satisfaction might be the ones with better self-rated health (SRH), a recognized predictor of cancer survival. We therefore investigated whether SRH can supersede patient satisfaction as a predictor of survival in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Nine hundred seventeen prostate cancer treated at four Cancer Treatment Centers of America(®) hospitals between July 2011 and March 2013. PS was measured on a 7-point scale ranging from ""completely dissatisfied"" to ""completely satisfied"". SRH was measured on a 7-point scale ranging from ""very poor"" to ""excellent"". Both were dichotomized into two categories: top box response (7) versus all others (1-6). Patient survival was the primary end point. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between PS and survival controlling for covariates.  Results:   The response rate for this study was 72%. Majority of patients (n = 517) had stage II disease. Seven hundred eighty-seven (85.8%) patients were ""completely satisfied"". Three hundred nineteen (34.8%) patients had ""excellent"" SRH. There was a weak but significant correlation between satisfaction and SRH (Kendall's tau b = 0.18; p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, ""completely satisfied"" patients had a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25-0.85; p = 0.01). Similarly, patients with ""excellent"" SRH had a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.11-0.58; p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, SRH was found to be a significant predictor of survival (HR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.12-0.79; p = 0.01) while patient satisfaction was not (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.5; p = 0.40).

One year after surgery, continence and patient satisfaction were evaluated.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-two patients undergoing RALP were prospectively randomized to urinary drainage with UC or with SPT. Functional results were assessed with standardized questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS Bother Score, IIEF and Visual Analogue Scale) preoperatively, after catheter removal and 1 year after surgery. Moreover, bother by the catheter as well as pain due to the catheter was assessed.  Results:   At personal hygiene, SPT was significantly less bothersome on the day of surgery as well as POD 1-6. Pain caused by the catheter did not differ significantly between the two groups except for POD 5 and 6, when the SPT performed significantly better. Differences regarding voiding parameters after catheter removal did not reach statistical significance. One year after surgery, no significant difference between the two groups was found regarding urinary function and IPSS. Though not statistically significant either, the need for the incision of bladder neck contracture (BNC) in two patients in the UC group is of note, as in the SPT group, no BNC occurred.

A major issue of very large scale is avoiding both over-treatment and under-treatment of CaP cases. The central challenge is deciding clinical significance or insignificance when the CaP biopsy results are positive but only marginally so. A related concern is deciding how to increase the number of biopsy cores for larger prostates. As a foundation for improved choice of number of cores and improved interpretation of biopsy results, we develop a probability model for the number of positive cores found in a biopsy, given the total number of cores, the volumes of the tumor nodules, and - very importantly - the prostate volume. Also, three applications are carried out: guidelines for the number of cores as a function of prostate volume, decision rules for insignificant versus significant CaP using number of positive cores, and, using prior distributions on total tumor size, Bayesian posterior probabilities for insignificant CaP and posterior median CaP. The model-based results have generality of application, take prostate volume into account, and provide attractive tradeoffs of specificity versus sensitivity.

However, the roles of miR-195 in human prostate cancer are still elusive. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the biological functions and its molecular mechanisms of miR-195 in human prostate cancer cell lines, discussing whether it has a potential to be a therapeutic way of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two human prostate cancer cell lines were analyzed for the expression of miR-195 by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A gain-of-function study of miR-195 was conducted by transfecting mimics into DU145 and PC3 cells and cell motility and invasion ability were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Tissue microarray, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against Fra-1 was performed using the peroxidase and DAB methods. The target gene of miR-195 was determined by luciferase assay, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. The regulation of motility by miR-195 was analyzed by western blot.  Results:   miR-195 was frequently down-regulated in both prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3. Overexpression of miR-195 significantly repressed the capability of migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In addition, we identified Fra-1, a cell motility regulator, as a novel target of miR-195. Fra-1 was up-regulated in prostate cancer tissues. We also observed that inhibition of miR-195 or restoration of Fra-1 in miR-195-over-expressed prostate cancer cells partially reversed the suppressive effects of miR-195. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-195 could inhibit prostate cancer cell motility by regulated the expression of c-Met, MMP1, MMP9.

Methods:   T2-weighted (T2W) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are acquired, and a patient-specific mold (PSM) is designed from the MRI. Following prostatectomy, a whole mount tissue specimen is placed in the PSM and sectioned, ensuring that tissue blocks roughly correspond to MRI slices. Rigid body and thin plate spline deformable registration attempt to correct deformation during image acquisition and tissue preparation and achieve a more complete one-to-one correspondence between MRIs and tissue sections. Each tissue section is stained with hematoxylin and eosin and segmented by adopting a machine learning approach. Utilizing this tissue segmentation and image registration, the density of cellular and tissue components (lumen, nucleus, epithelium, and stroma) is estimated per MR voxel, generating density maps for the whole prostate.  Results:   This study was approved by the local IRB, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Registration of tissue specimens and MRIs was aided by the PSM and subsequent image registration. Tissue segmentation was performed using a machine learning approach, achieving ≥0.98 AUCs for lumen, nucleus, epithelium, and stroma. Examining the density map of tissue components, significant differences were observed between cancer, benign peripheral zone, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (p value <5e−2). Similarly, the signal intensity of the corresponding areas in both T2W MRI and DWI was significantly different (p value <1e−10).

A key mechanism of resistance to anti-androgens is through expression of constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs) that are refractory to next-generation therapies, including Enzalutamide and Abiraterone. By maintaining an androgenic gene signature, AR-Vs drive tumour survival and progression in castrate conditions. Critically, however, our understanding of the mechanics of AR-V-driven transcription is limited, particularly with respect to dependency on pioneer factor function. Here we show that depletion of FOXA1 in the CWR22Rv1 CRPC cell line abrogates the oncogenic potential of AR-Vs. Gene expression profiling reveals that approximately 41% of the AR-V transcriptome requires FOXA1 and that depletion of FOXA1 attenuates AR-V binding at a sub-set of analysed co-regulated genes. Interestingly, AR-V levels are elevated in cells depleted of FOXA1 as a consequence of attenuated negative feedback on the AR gene, but is insufficient to maintain cell growth as evidenced by marked anti-proliferative effects in FOXA1 knockdown cells. In all, our data suggests that AR-Vs are dependent on FOXA1 for sustaining a pro-proliferative gene signature and agents targeting FOXA1 may represent novel therapeutic options for CRPC patients.""","""['Dominic Jones', 'Mark Wade', 'Sirintra Nakjang', 'Lewis Chaytor', 'James Grey', 'Craig N Robson', 'Luke Gaughan']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Development and exploitation of a novel mutant androgen receptor modelling strategy to identify new targets for advanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Elevated levels of FOXA1 facilitate androgen receptor chromatin binding resulting in a CRPC-like phenotype.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Cistrome and transcriptome analysis identifies unique androgen receptor (AR) and AR-V7 splice variant chromatin binding and transcriptional activities.', 'Development of a High-Throughput Screening Assay for Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants.']"""

In addition to well-described roles in plant growth, EBR induces apoptosis in the LNCaP prostate cancer cells expressing functional androgen receptor (AR). Therefore, it is suggested that EBR might have an inhibitory potential on androgen receptor signaling pathway. However, the mechanism by which EBR exerts its effects on LNCaP is poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we used an unbiased global proteomics approach, i.e., stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). In total, 964 unique proteins were identified, 160 of which were differentially expressed after 12 h of EBR treatment. The quantification of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that the expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) chaperone protein, calreticulin (CALR), was dramatically downregulated. The decrease in CALR expression was also validated by immunoblotting. Because our data revealed the involvement of the UPR in response to EBR exposure, we evaluated the expression of the other UPR proteins. We demonstrated that EBR treatment downregulated calnexin and upregulated BiP and IRE1α expression levels and induced CHOP translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus. The translocation of CHOP was associated with caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation after a 12 h EBR treatment. Co-treatment of EBR with rapamycin, an upstream mTOR pathway inhibitor, prevented EBR-induced cell viability loss and PARP cleavage in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, suggesting that EBR could induce ER stress in these cells. In addition, we observed similar results in DU145 cells with nonfunctional androgen receptor. When proteasomal degradation of proteins was blocked by MG132 co-treatment, EBR treatment further induced PARP cleavage relative to drug treatment alone. EBR also induced Ca2+ sequestration, which confirmed the alteration of the ER pathway due to drug treatment. Therefore, we suggest that EBR promotes ER stress and induces apoptosis.""","""['Pinar Obakan', 'Carlos Barrero', 'Ajda Coker-Gurkan', 'Elif Damla Arisan', 'Salim Merali', 'Narcin Palavan-Unsal']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Calreticulin is a fine tuning molecule in epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis through activating endoplasmic reticulum stress in colon cancer cells.', 'Epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 expression via activating polyamine catabolic machinery, a common target for androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of polyamine catabolic enzymes involved in diverse responses against epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Epibrassinolide alters PI3K/MAPK signaling axis via activating Foxo3a-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of natural brassinosteroid-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Gemcitabine in combination with epibrassinolide enhanced the apoptotic response in an ER stress-dependent manner and reduced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Posiphen Reduces the Levels of Huntingtin Protein through Translation Suppression.', 'Epibrassinolide prevents tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3β inhibition in vitro and improves Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and motor deficits in combination with roscovitine.', 'Epibrassinolide activates AKT to trigger autophagy with polyamine metabolism in SW480 and DLD-1 colon cancer cell lines.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Brassinosteroids in Biomedical and Clinical Research.']"""

Studies suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with the progression of PCa; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have not been extensively investigated. PCa progression is characterized by increased cell migration and alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM)‑ and cell adhesion molecule (CAM)‑related gene expression. In the present study, the influence of cigarette smoke medium (SM) on cell migration and on the expression of ECM‑ and CAM‑related genes in PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells was investigated. According to a wound‑healing assay, SM treatment promoted PC3 cell migration. RNA expression levels from SM‑treated and control cells were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Of 84 genes analyzed, 27.38% (23/84) exhibited a ≥2‑fold change in threshold cycle in PC3 cells following 0.5% SM treatment. Functional gene grouping analysis demonstrated that SM treatment modulated the RNA transcription of approximately 18.4% of CAMs and 33.93% of ECM‑related genes. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that SM treatment led to a significant decrease in transcription levels of the following genes: Collagen 5 α‑1(V), connective tissue growth factor, integrin β‑2, kallmann syndrome 1, laminin α 3, matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), MMP13, secreted protein acidic cysteine‑rich, thrombospondin‑2 and versican; and that SM significantly increased the transcription levels of MMP2 and MMP12.

The current protocols for RNA extraction of i) the phenol-chloroform method, ii) the affinity column method and iii) magnetic beads with poly-T functionalization and a capturer strand were applied separately for RNA extraction in urine samples. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the yield of the three methods of RNA extraction. Furthermore, 52 urine samples after prostate massage from patients suspected of a diagnosis of prostate cancer were collected. The Mag-Cap method and RT-PCR were applied to obtain the PCA3 score. The clinical value of the PCA3 score was investigated by comparison with the pathology of the prostate biopsy. The yield of the Mag-Cap method was higher than that of the phenol‑chloroform method and commercial kits. Thirty‑four patients were pathologically diagnosed with prostate cancer and 18 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It was confirmed that the median PCA3 score was higher among the prostate cancer patients than those with benign disease (53.5 vs. 17, p=0.000). A sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 77.8% were obtained when the cut-off value for the PCA3 score was 28.5. The Mag-Cap method was found to be more efficient for RNA extraction.

Materials and methods:   We identified 459 men treated with RP with pathological Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in the SEARCH database. The men were stratified into five groups based on pathological characteristics: group 1, men with negative surgical margins (NSMs) and no ECE; group 2, men with positive surgical margin (PSMs) and no ECE; group 3, men with NSMs and ECE; group 4, men with PSMs and ECE; and group 5, men with SVI. Cox proportional hazards models and the log-rank test were used to compare BCR among the groups.  Results:   At 2 years after RP, pathological group was significantly correlated with BCR (log-rank, P < 0.001) with patients in group 5 (+SVI) having the highest BCR risk (66%) and those in group 1 (NSMs and no ECE) having the lowest risk (14%). When we compared groups 2, 3, and 4, with each other, there was no significant difference in BCR among the groups (~50% 2-year BCR risk; log-rank P = 0.28).

Materials and methods:   An observational retrospective study was performed in 120 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), treated with robot-assisted RP but eligible for AS according to Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance criteria. Blood and urine specimens were collected before initial prostate biopsy for PHI and PCA3 measurements, respectively. In addition, all patients underwent mpMRI, preoperatively and 6-8 weeks after biopsy, with a 1.5T scanner using a four-to-five-channel phase array coil combined with an endorectal coin. mpMRI images were assessed and diagrams showing the prostate sextants were used to designate regions of abnormality within the prostate. Prostate findings were assigned to one of five categories according to Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System guidelines (PI-RADS) and considered positive for PCa if final PI-RADS score was >3 and negative if ≤3.  Results:   Pathologically confirmed reclassification was observed in 55 patients (45.8%). mpMRI showed good specificity and negative predictive value (0.61 and 0.73, respectively) for excluding PCSPCa compared with the PHI and PCA3. On multivariate analyses and after 1 000 bootstrapping resampling, the inclusion of both mpMRI and the PHI significantly increased the accuracy of the base model in predicting PCSPCa. For the prediction of PCSPCa, in particular, the base model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 which significantly increased by 4% with the addition of the PHI (AUC = 0.75; P < 0.01) and by 7% with the addition of mpMRI (AUC = 0.78; P < 0.01). Decision-curve analysis showed that the multivariable model with mpMRI had the highest net benefit.

This study examines the relationship between intra-operative time and two indicators of tissue integrity: number of epithelial cells per gram of tissue and RNA integrity numbers (RINs). The study also compares the RIN values of tissue obtained intra-operatively by biopsy, before and after devascularization, to those from RALP specimen tissue, obtained through the routine research tissue procurement process.  Methods:   Prostate tissues from two series of patients were analyzed. In the first, tissue from 18 patients undergoing RALP was analyzed for number of epithelial cells per gram of tissue. In the second, RIN values of tissue from 46 patients involved in a clinical study were analyzed. RIN values were assessed from RALP specimen tissue as well as tissue removed intra-operatively by biopsy, before and after devascularization.  Results:   Time from RALP to tissue procurement was not significantly associated with number of epithelial cells per gram of tissue or with RIN values.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all radical prostatectomies (RPs) performed for localized prostate cancer in Victoria, Australia, from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset, a large administrative database that records all hospital inpatient episodes in Victoria. The first database, covering the period from July 2010 to April 2013 (n = 5 130), was used to compare length of hospital stay (LOS) and blood transfusion rates between surgical approaches. This was subsequently integrated into an economic model. A second database (n = 5 581) was extracted to cover the period between July 2010 and June 2013, three full financial years, to depict patterns of care and make future predictions for the 2014-2015 financial year, and to perform a hospital volume analysis. We then created an economic model to evaluate the incremental cost of RARP vs open RP (ORP) and laparoscopic RP (LRP), incorporating the cost-offset from differences in LOS and blood transfusion rate. The economic model constructs estimates of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) costs of ORP and LRP, adds the gross cost of the surgical robot (capital, consumables, maintenance and repairs), and manipulates these DRG costs to obtain a DRG cost per day, which can be used to estimate the cost-offset associated with RARP in comparison with ORP and LRP. Economic modelling was performed around a base-case scenario, assuming a 7-year robot lifespan and 124 RARPs performed per financial year. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed for the four-arm da Vinci SHD, Si and Si dual surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical Ltd, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).  Results:   We identified 5 581 patients who underwent RP in 20 hospitals in Victoria with an open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgical approach in the public and private sector. The majority of RPs (4 233, 75.8%), in Victoria were performed in the private sector, with an overall 11.5% decrease in the total number of RPs performed over the 3-year study period. In the most recent financial year, 820 (47%), 765 (44%) and 173 patients (10%) underwent RARP, ORP and LRP, respectively. In the same timeframe, RARP accounted for 26 and 53% of all RPs in the public and private sector, respectively. Public hospitals in Victoria perform a median number of 14 RPs per year and 40% of hospitals perform <10 RPs per year. In the public system, RARP was associated with a mean (±sd) LOS of 1.4 (±1.3) days compared with 3.6 (±2.7) days for LRP and 4.8 (±3.5) days for ORP (P < 0.001). The mean blood transfusion rates were 0, 6 and 15% for RARP, LRP and ORP, respectively (P < 0.001). The incremental cost per RARP case compared with ORP and LRP was A$442 and A$2 092, respectively, for the da Vinci S model, A$1 933 and A$3 583, respectively, for the da Vinci Si model and A$3 548 and A$5 198, respectively for the da Vinci Si dual. RARP can become cost-equivalent with ORP where ~140 cases per year are performed in the base-case scenario.  Conclusions:   Over the period studied, RARP has become the dominant approach to RP, with significantly shorter LOS and lower blood transfusion rate. This translates to a significant cost-offset, which is further enhanced by increasing the case volume, extending the lifespan of the robot and reductions in the cost of consumables and capital.""","""['Marnique Basto', 'Niranjan Sathianathen', 'Luc Te Marvelde', 'Shane Ryan', 'Jeremy Goad', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Daniel A Moon', 'Alexander G Heriot', 'Jim Butler', 'Declan G Murphy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Health resource use after robot-assisted surgery vs open and conventional laparoscopic techniques in oncology: analysis of English secondary care data for radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy.', 'Hospitalization costs for radical prostatectomy attributable to robotic surgery.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Surgical outcomes and cost analysis of a multi-specialty robotic-assisted surgery caseload in the Australian public health system.', 'Strategies to improve cost effectiveness of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in emerging economies.', 'Cost-utility analysis on robot-assisted and laparoscopic prostatectomy based on long-term functional outcomes.', 'Robotic prostatectomy after abandoned open radical prostatectomy-Technical aspects and outcomes.', 'Comparison of urinary and sexual patient-reported outcomes between open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matched, population-based study in Victoria.']"""

A postoperative image survey may better predict PPI than a preoperative survey.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to determine whether postoperative cystography bladder patterns can predict PPI at short- and long-term follow-up.  Methods:   In total, 180 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) from September 2008 to September 2014, and who were followed for at least 6 months, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent cystography within 2 weeks after RARP before Foley catheter removal, and all parameters were analyzed to evaluate the relationship with PPI at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post-RARP. Patients were also divided into four bladder neck level groups, according to the relative position of the bladder neck to the pubic symphysis.  Results:   A total of 119 patients were followed for at least 48 months after RARP. Cystography patterns were analyzed, including the downward bladder neck, bladder height, bladder width, height to width ratio, and bladder neck angle. A more downward bladder neck and a sharper bladder neck angle were significant predictors of PPI at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after RARP. Patients with a larger bladder height or height to width ratio (prolate bladder shape) tended to have poor outcomes regarding PPI. Clinicians can also use a bladder neck level classification to rapidly predict the outcome of PPI.  Conclusions:   Postoperative cystography is a reliable and cost-effective tool for predicting PPI. A more downward bladder neck and a sharper bladder neck angle have the greatest predictive power for short- and long-term PPI.""","""['I-Hung Shao', 'Chih-Yuan Chou', 'Chen-Chih Huang', 'Cheng-Feng Lin', 'Ying-Hsu Chang', 'Hsiao-Jung Tseng', 'Chun-Te Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Postoperative cystogram findings predict incontinence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The location of the bladder neck in postoperative cystography predicts continence convalescence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-sparing Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Associated with Less Bladder Neck Descent and Better Early Continence Outcome.', 'Anatomic and technical considerations for optimizing recovery of urinary function during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comprehensive approach for post-prostatectomy incontinence in the era of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Recognition of Postoperative Cystography Features by Artificial Intelligence to Predict Recovery from Postprostatectomy Urinary Incontinence: A Rapid and Easy Way to Predict Functional Outcome.', 'Simple and reliable predictive factor for early recovery of urinary continence after non-nerve-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Novel cystography parameter to predict early recovery from urinary continence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a retrospective study.', 'Urinary continence outcomes of four years of follow-up and predictors of early and late urinary continence in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) evaluation of short- and long-term outcome after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP): selective cystogram to improve outcome.']"""

In this study, we used 1 as a scaffold to conduct lead optimization, which generated a series of derivatives.

Currently, focal salvage (FS) instead of whole-gland or total salvage (TS) is being investigated, to reduce severe toxicity associated with cumulative radiation dose. Differences in urethral and bladder dosimetry and constraints to reduce late (> 90 days) genitourinary (GU) toxicity are presented here.  Materials and methods:   Dosimetry on intraoperative ultrasound (US) of 20 FS and 28 TS patients was compared. The prostate, bladder, urethra and bulbomembranous (BM) urethra were delineated. Toxicity was assessed using the CTCAE version 4.0. Dose constraints to reduce toxicity in TS patients were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   FS I-125 BT significantly reduces bladder and urethral dose compared to TS. Grade 3 GU toxicity occurred once in the FS group. For TS patients late severe (⩾ grade 3) GU toxicity was frequent (38% in the total 61 patients and 56% in the 27 analyzed patients). TS patients with ⩾ grade 3 GU toxicity showed higher bladder D2 cc than TS patients without toxicity (median 43 Gy) (p = 0.02). The urethral V100 was significantly higher in TS patients with several toxicity profiles: ⩾ grade 3 urethral strictures, ⩾ grade 2 urinary retention and multiple ⩾ grade 2 GU toxicity events. Dose to the BM urethra did not show a relation with stricture formation. ROC-analysis indicated a bladder D2 cc <70 Gy to prevent ⩾ grade 3 GU toxicity (AUC 0.76, 95%CI: 0.56-0.96, p = 0.02). A urethral V100 < 0.40 cc (AUC from 0.73-0.91, p = 0.003-0.05) could prevent other late GU toxicity.  Conclusion:   FS I-125 BT reduces urethral and bladder dose significantly compared to TS. With TS, there is an increased risk of cumulative dose and severe GU toxicity. Based on these findings, bladder D2 cc should be below 70 Gy and urethral V100 below 0.40 cc.""","""['Max Peters', 'Jochem van der Voort van Zyp', 'Carel Hoekstra', 'Hendrik Westendorp', 'Sandrine van de Pol', 'Marinus Moerland', 'Metha Maenhout', 'Rob Kattevilder', 'Marco van Vulpen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Rectal dose constraints for salvage iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Permanent implant prostate cancer brachytherapy: 2013 state-of-the art.', 'Urethral toxicity after LDR brachytherapy: experience in Japan.', 'Favorable long-term toxicity for salvage low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy from a phase II prospective trial (NRG Oncology/RTOG 0526).', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: the technical challenges.', 'Second salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Comparative cost-effectiveness of focal and total salvage 125I brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy.', 'Template guided transperineal saturation biopsy of the prostate: lessons for focal and urethra-sparing high-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.']"""

VMAT, IMPT and HDR-BT plans were created for each patient with an EQD2(α/β) DIL aimed at 111.6 Gy, PTV(initial) D(pres) was 80.9 Gy (EBRT) with CTV D90%=81.9 Gy (HDR-BT). Hard dose constraints were applied for OARs.  Results:   Higher boost doses were achieved with IMPT compared to VMAT, keeping major OAR doses at similar levels. Patient averaged EQD2(α/β) D50% to DIL were 110.7, 114.2 and 150.1 Gy(IsoE) for VMAT, IMPT and HDR-BT, respectively. Respective rectal wall D(mean) were 30.5±5.0, 16.7±3.6, 9.5±2.5 Gy(IsoE) and bladder wall D(mean) were 21.0±5.5, 15.6±4.3 and 6.3±2.2 Gy(IsoE).  Conclusions:   DIL boosting was found to be feasible with all investigated techniques. Although OAR doses were higher than for standard treatment approach, the risk levels were reasonably low. HDR-BT was superior to VMAT and IMPT, both in terms of OAR sparing and DIL boosting.""","""['Piotr Andrzejewski', 'Peter Kuess', 'Barbara Knäusl', 'Katja Pinker', 'Petra Georg', 'Johannes Knoth', 'Daniel Berger', 'Christian Kirisits', 'Gregor Goldner', 'Thomas Helbich', 'Richard Pötter', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Prostate stereotactic ablative radiation therapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy to dominant intraprostatic lesions.', 'Radiotherapy Boost for the Dominant Intraprostatic Cancer Lesion-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'The value of brachytherapy in the age of advanced external beam radiotherapy: a\xa0review of the literature in terms of dosimetry.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography for lesion-directed high-dose-rate brachytherapy dose escalation.', 'Proton therapy for prostate cancer: current state and future perspectives.', 'Comparative dosimetrical analysis of intensity-modulated arc therapy, CyberKnife therapy and image-guided interstitial HDR and LDR brachytherapy of low risk prostate cancer.']"""

A multi-dose atlas was built based on the anatomy patterns of the patients, more specifically, the percent distance to the prostate and the concaveness angle formed by the seminal vesicles relative to the anterior-posterior axis. A 70-case dataset was classified using a k-medoids clustering analysis to recognize anatomy pattern variations in the dataset. The best classification, defined by the number of classes or medoids, was determined by the largest value of the average silhouette width. Reference plans from each class formed a multi-dose atlas. The atlas-guided planning (AGP) technique started with matching the new case anatomy pattern to one of the reference cases in the atlas; then a deformable registration between the atlas and new case anatomies transferred the dose from the atlas to the new case to guide inverse planning with full automation. 20 additional clinical cases were re-planned to evaluate the AGP technique. Dosimetric properties between AGP and clinical plans were evaluated. The classification analysis determined that the 5-case atlas would best represent anatomy patterns for the patient cohort. AGP took approximately 1 min on average (corresponding to 70 iterations of optimization) for all cases. When dosimetric parameters were compared, the differences between AGP and clinical plans were less than 3.5%, albeit some statistical significances observed: homogeneity index (p > 0.05), conformity index (p < 0.01), bladder gEUD (p < 0.01), and rectum gEUD (p = 0.02). Atlas-guided treatment planning is feasible and efficient. Atlas predicted dose can effectively guide the optimizer to achieve plan quality comparable to that of clinical plans.""","""['Yang Sheng', 'Taoran Li', 'You Zhang', 'W Robert Lee', 'Fang-Fang Yin', 'Yaorong Ge', 'Q Jackie Wu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Radiotherapy treatment plans with RapidArc for prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and lymph nodes.', 'Strategies for online organ motion correction for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: prostate, rectum, and bladder dose effects.', 'Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The Mandible: An Atlas of Osteological and Radiological Anatomy.', 'Artificial intelligence guided physician directive improves head and neck planning quality and practice Uniformity: A prospective study.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Automatic treatment planning for cervical cancer radiation therapy using direct three-dimensional patient anatomy match.', 'Assessing the robustness of artificial intelligence powered planning tools in radiotherapy clinical settings-a phantom simulation approach.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.']"""

However, studies have yet to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions in advanced prostate cancer (APC). This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a technology-assisted, 10-week, group-based psychosocial intervention for diverse men with APC.  Methods:   The participants were 74 men (mean age, 68.84 years; non-Hispanic white, 57%; black, 40.5%) who were randomized to a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) treatment or health promotion (HP) attention-control condition. The participants were assessed at the baseline, weekly throughout the 10-week program, and 6 months after the baseline. Outcomes were assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System along with established measures of HRQOL, CBSM intervention targets (eg, relaxation skills), and patient-reported acceptability.  Results:   Feasibility was demonstrated through good retention rates (>85%) and acceptable average attendance rates (>70%), and acceptability was demonstrated through very favorable weekly session evaluations (mean score, 4/5) and exit surveys (mean score, 3.6/4). Men randomized to the CBSM condition reported significant reductions (P < .05) in depressive symptoms and improvements in relaxation self-efficacy (P < .05) at the 6-month follow-up. CBSM participants reported trends for improvement in distress and functional well-being (P < .08) in comparison with those in the HP condition. Effect sizes ranged from medium (0.54) to large (1.87) and, in some instances, were clinically meaningful.

Their application is, nevertheless, restricted by absence of efficacious, biocompatible, and cancer-targeting nanosystems. In this paper, we report that 2-[3-[5-amino-1-carboxypentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic acid (Acupa)-decorated pH-responsive chimaeric polymersomes (Acupa-CPs) efficiently deliver therapeutic proteins into prostate cancer cells. Acupa-CPs had a unimodal distribution with average sizes ranging from 157-175 nm depending on amounts of Acupa. They displayed highly efficient loading of both model proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and cytochrome C (CC), affording high protein loading contents of 9.1-24.5 wt.%. The in vitro release results showed that protein release was markedly accelerated at mildly acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of acetal bonds in the vesicular membrane. CLSM and MTT studies demonstrated that CC-loaded Acupa10-CPs mediated efficient delivery of protein drugs into PSMA positive LNCaP cells leading to pronounced antitumor effect, in contrast to their non-targeting counterparts and free CC. Remarkably, granzyme B (GrB)-loaded Acupa10-CPs caused effective apoptosis of LNCaP cells with a low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.6 nM. Flow cytometry and CLSM studies using MitoCapture™ revealed obvious depletion of mitochondria membrane potential in LNCaP cells treated with GrB-loaded Acupa10-CPs. The preliminary in vivo experiments showed that Acupa-CPs had a long circulation time with an elimination phase half-life of 3.3h in nude mice.

This study examined whether these factors were associated with delays in diagnostic resolution among patients with cancer screening abnormalities and whether patient navigation ameliorated these delays.  Methods:   This study analyzed data from 5 of 10 centers of the National Cancer Institute's Patient Navigation Research Program, which collected SES and household data on employment, income, education, housing, marital status, and household composition. The primary outcome was the time to diagnostic resolution after a cancer screening abnormality. Separate adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were fit for each SES and household factor, and an interaction between that factor and the intervention status was included.  Results:   Among the 3777 participants (1968 in the control arm and 1809 in the navigation intervention arm), 91% were women, and the mean age was 44 years; 43% were Hispanic, 28% were white, and 27% were African American. Within the control arm, the unemployed experienced a longer time to resolution than those employed full-time (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .02). Renters (HR, 0.81; P = .02) and those with other (ie, unstable) housing (HR, 0.60; P < .001) had delays in comparison with homeowners. Never married (HR, 0.70; P < .001) and previously married participants (HR, 0.85; P = .03) had a longer time to care than married participants. There were no differences in the time to diagnostic resolution with any of these variables within the navigation intervention arm.

In this study, we investigated whether prostate cancer (PCa) cells cultured in three-dimensional (3D) chitosan-alginate (CA) porous scaffolds could model cationic NP-mediated gene targeted delivery to tumors in vitro. We assessed in vitro tumor cell proliferation, formation of tumor spheroids, and expression of marker genes that promote tumor malignancy in CA scaffolds. The efficacy of NP-targeted gene delivery was evaluated in PCa cells in 2D cultures, PCa tumor spheroids grown in CA scaffolds, and PCa tumors in a mouse TRAMP-C2 flank tumor model. PCa cells cultured in CA scaffolds grew into tumor spheroids and displayed characteristics of higher malignancy as compared to those in 2D cultures. Significantly, targeted gene delivery was only observed in cells cultured in CA scaffolds, whereas cells cultured on 2D plates showed no difference in gene delivery between targeted and nontarget control NPs. In vivo NP evaluation confirmed targeted gene delivery, indicating that only CA scaffolds correctly modeled NP-mediated targeted delivery in vivo.

Methods:   High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridisation profiling of DNA from PCa and matched morphologically normal prostate samples from 9 BRCA2 germline mutation carriers and 16 non-carriers in combination with unsupervised analysis was used to define copy number features.  Results:   PCa from BRCA2 germline mutation carriers (B2T) harbour significantly more CNA than non-carrier tumours (NCTs) (P = 14 × 10(-6)). A hundred and sixteen regions had a significantly different distribution with both false discovery rate (FDR) and P value <0.01, including CNA in the genomic region containing c-MYC that was present in 89% B2T versus 12.5% NCT (P = 3 × 10(-4)). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA2 locus was observed in 67% of B2T. Elevated CNA are already present in 50% of the morphologically normal prostate tissue from BRCA2 carriers.  Conclusion:   The relative high amount of CNAs in morphologically normal prostate tissue of BRCA2 carriers implies a field effect and together with the observed LOH could be used as a marker of PCa risk in these men.

All the synthesized compounds were screened for their anticancer activity against four tumor cell lines, viz. HT-29 (colon), PC-3 (prostate), A549 (lung), and U87MG (glioblastoma) cells. Most of the tested compounds showed moderate to potent cell growth inhibition on different cancer cells, in particular, the compounds 17, 23, and 29 exhibited promising cytotoxicity against these cell lines with the IC50 values in the range of 0.86-3.72 μM. In addition, the potential mechanism of cell growth inhibition and apoptotic induction by these compounds was investigated in U87MG cancer cells using cell-based assays, including wound healing assay, flow cytometry, Hoechst staining, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, Annexin V-FITC/propidium Iodide dual staining, Rhodamine 123 staining, and carboxy-DCFDA staining. The results indicate that the compounds induce apoptosis in U87MG cells via mitochondrial pathway through up-regulation of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes.

By combining echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with a two-dimensional (2D) J-resolved spectroscopic (JPRESS) sequence, 2D spectra can be recorded in multiple locations in a single slice of prostate using four-dimensional (4D) echo planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (EP-JRESI). The goal of the present work was to validate two different non-linear reconstruction methods independently using compressed sensing-based 4D EP-JRESI in prostate cancer (PCa): maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and total variation (TV). Twenty-two patients with PCa with a mean age of 63.8 years (range, 46-79 years) were investigated in this study. A 4D non-uniformly undersampled (NUS) EP-JRESI sequence was implemented on a Siemens 3-T MRI scanner. The NUS data were reconstructed using two non-linear reconstruction methods, namely MaxEnt and TV. Using both TV and MaxEnt reconstruction methods, the following observations were made in cancerous compared with non-cancerous locations: (i) higher mean (choline + creatine)/citrate metabolite ratios; (ii) increased levels of (choline + creatine)/spermine and (choline + creatine)/myo-inositol; and (iii) decreased levels of (choline + creatine)/(glutamine + glutamate).

Methods:   We analyzed PCa after radical prostatectomy using the combined grading of Gleason and Helpap, which allows an exact differentiation particularly of low and intermediate grade tumors. Additionally, we attached time-interval and percentage value of recurrences of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as well as death on disease (DoD) to the prognostic grade grouping.  Results:   Carcinomas of group I/V are very low-grade tumors with very good prognosis without biochemical recurrence and DoD predestining for active surveillance (AS). The group II/V with low progress of PSA without DoD allows the options of an active treatment or AS and shows a prognostic separation of the intermediate group III/V. Within the high-grade groups, a differentiation is necessary between GS 7b (4 + 3), 8, and 9-10 regarding TNM staging and rate of DoD. Prognosis of GS 7b (4 + 3) group III/V is more favourable without DoD in contrast to group IV and V/V with cases of DoD.

These pathological conditions are similar to the signs of the terminal stage of human androgen-independent prostate cancer. The co-chaperone small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α (SGTA) is known to be overexpressed in human androgen-independent prostate cancer. However, there is little information about the structure and function of canine SGTA. In this study, canine SGTA was cloned and analysed for its ability to suppress androgen receptor signalling. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of the canine SGTA gene was amplified by RT-PCR using primers designed from canine-expressed sequence tags that were homologous to human SGTA. The canine SGTA ORF has high homology with the corresponding human (89%) and mouse (81%) sequences. SGTA dimerisation region and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains are conserved across the three species. The ability of canine SGTA to undergo homodimerisation was demonstrated by a mammalian two-hybrid system and a pull-down assay. The negative impact of canine SGTA on androgen receptor (AR) signalling was demonstrated using a reporter assay in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines. Pathological analysis showed overexpression of SGTA in canine prostate cancer, but not in hyperplasia. A reporter assay in prostate cells demonstrated suppression of AR signalling by canine SGTA.

This is particularly important for men presenting for an initial biopsy with an equivocal PSA in the 2-10 ng ml(-1) range. PCA3 and ERG are biomarkers that can add predictive value for PCa in urine; however, with a limited utility as a digital rectal exam (DRE) is required.  Methods:   First-catch urine samples were collected at six sites from men scheduled to undergo a prostate biopsy. Exosomal RNA was extracted, RNA copy numbers of ERG and PCA3 were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the EXO106 score (the sum of normalized PCA3 and ERG RNA levels) was computed. Performance was compared with standard of care (SOC; PSA, age, race or family history) parameters. Contingency table, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics curve and box-plot analyses were performed.  Results:   In this cohort (N=195), a dichotomous EXO106 score demonstrated good clinical performance in predicting biopsy result for both any cancer and high-grade disease. For high-grade disease, the negative and positive predictive values were 97.5% and 34.5%, respectively. The discrimination between high-grade and Gleason score ⩽ 6 (including benign) biopsy results by a combination of EXO106 and SOC (area under the curve (AUC)=0.803) was significantly improved compared with SOC without EXO106 (AUC=0.6723, P=0.0009). The median EXO106 score correlated (P<0.001; Spearman's rank order) with histologic grade.  Conclusions:   A novel molecular signature (EXO106 score) derived from non-DRE urine demonstrated independent, negative predictive value for the diagnosis of high-grade PCa from initial biopsy for men with 'gray zone' serum PSA levels.

In addition, autophagy control is emerging to prevent cancer cell survival. Autophagy breaks down the unnecessary cytoplasmic components into anabolic units and energy sources, which are the most important sources for making the ATP that maintains homeostasis in cancer cell growth and survival. Therefore, the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) has been used as an anticancer reagent due to its inhibition of glycolysis.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells (PC3) were treated with 2DG for 6 h or 48 h to analyze the changing of cell cycle and autophagic flux. Rapamycin and LC3B overexpressing vectors were administered to PC3 cells for autophagy induction and chloroquine and shBeclin1 plasmid were used to inhibit autophagy in PC3 cells to analyze PC3 cells growth and survival. The samples for western blotting were prepared in each culture condition to confirm the expression level of autophagy related and regulating proteins.  Results:   We demonstrated that 2DG inhibits PC3 cells growth and had discriminating effects on autophagy regulation based on the different time period of 2DG treatment to control cell survival. Short-term treatment of 2DG induced autophagic flux, which increased microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) conversion rates and reduced p62 levels. However, 2DG induced autophagic flux is remarkably reduced over an extended time period of 2DG treatment for 48 h despite autophagy inducing internal signaling being maintained. The relationship between cell growth and autophagy was proved. Increased autophagic flux by rapamycin or LC3B overexpression powerfully reduced cell growth, while autophagy inhibition with shBeclin1 plasmid or chloroquine had no significant effect on regulating cell growth.  Conclusion:   Given these results, maintaining increased autophagic flux was more effective at inhibiting cancer cell progression than inhibition of autophagic flux, which is necessary for the survival of PC3 cells. Autophagic flux should be tightly regulated to maintain metabolic homeostasis for cancer cell growth and survival in PC3 cells and is a suitable target for cancer therapy.""","""['Jeong Yong Jeon', 'Seung Won Kim', 'Ki Cheong Park', 'Mijin Yun']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Autophagic flux determines cell death and survival in response to Apo2L/TRAIL (dulanermin).', 'Targeting cancer cell metabolism: the combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose induces p53-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Monitoring Autophagic Flux by Using Lysosomal Inhibitors and Western Blotting of Endogenous MAP1LC3B.', '2-Deoxy-D-glucose targeting of glucose metabolism in cancer cells as a potential therapy.', 'Modulating autophagy in cancer therapy: Advancements and challenges for cancer cell death sensitization.', 'Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming in Bladder Cancer: Hexokinase 2 (HK2) as Prognostic Biomarker and Target for Bladder Cancer Therapy.', 'The Anticancer Ruthenium Compound BOLD-100 Targets Glycolysis and Generates a Metabolic Vulnerability towards Glucose Deprivation.', 'Dual Hyaluronic Acid and Folic Acid Targeting pH-Sensitive Multifunctional 2DG@DCA@MgO-Nano-Core-Shell-Radiosensitizer for Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Unfolding the role of autophagy in the cancer metabolism.', '2-Deoxy-d-glucose Promotes Buforin IIb-Induced Cytotoxicity in Prostate Cancer DU145 Cells and Xenograft Tumors.']"""

However, little is known about individual-level factors impacting end-of-life care preferences.  Objectives:   To examine whether the five-factor model of personality explains variation in preferences for end-of-life care in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two hundred twelve men with a prostate cancer diagnosis (mean age = 62 years) completed a measure of the five-factor model of personality--spanning the personality dimensions of neuroticism, agreeableness, extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness--and reported on end-of-life care preferences. Cluster analyses were used to partition the sample into groups with similar care preferences. Analyses of variance and Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in care preferences among the groups.  Results:   Cluster analyses revealed three groups of participants: ""comfort-oriented patients,"" ""service-accepting patients,"" and ""service-reluctant patients."" Most (67%) were comfort oriented, preferring palliative care and opposing life support services. A subset of patients were service accepting (17%), preferring both palliative care and life support, or were service reluctant (16%), preferring neither. Service-reluctant patients endorsed significantly higher levels of neuroticism (emotional instability and negativity) than comfort-oriented patients. Comfort-oriented patients endorsed significantly higher levels of agreeableness than service-accepting patients and service-reluctant patients.  Conclusion:   Findings suggest that personality traits are associated with specific health care preferences. Individuals high on neuroticism are likely to report reluctance toward all forms of end-of-life care and may benefit from in-depth information about the process and likely outcomes of receiving life support and palliative care services.""","""['Emily G Lattie', 'Yasmin Asvat', 'Smriti Shivpuri', 'James Gerhart', ""Sean O'Mahony"", 'Paul Duberstein', 'Michael Hoerger']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pain Symptom Manage""","""['The Influence of Hypothetical Death Scenarios on Multidimensional End-of-Life Care Preferences.', ""Preferences for Life-Sustaining Treatments and Associations With Accurate Prognostic Awareness and Depressive Symptoms in Terminally Ill Cancer Patients' Last Year of Life."", 'Physician-patient end-of-life care discussions: correlates and associations with end-of-life care preferences of cancer patients-a cross-sectional survey study.', 'Communication preferences of patients with prostate cancer : Preferences regarding the communication of bad news of patients with prostate cancer in Germany-results of an anonymous patient survey.', 'Bladder and bowel preferences of patients at the end of life: a scoping review.', 'Where would Canadians prefer to die?

Methods:   We describe our 12-year experience on the diagnostic usefulness of a biomarker panel consisting of eight molecules (i.e., α-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate-specific antigen, CA 19-9, CA125, CA 15-3, squamous cell specific antigen, and cytokeratin 19 fragment) for cancer screening in Taiwanese subjects who underwent a health check-up examination at their own expenses.  Results:   The sensitivity of the panel for the detection of specific cancers was higher than that of isolated cancer-specific markers. Specifically, the sensitivity of the panel for identifying the four most commonly diagnosed malignancies (i.e., liver cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer) was 90.9%, 75.0%, 100%, and 76.9%, respectively. The ability of the panel to detect early-stage (stage 1) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or prostate cancer was similar to that observed for advanced malignancies.

Using population cohort data, in this study we examined sexual and urinary function in men undergoing open radical prostatectomy vs those undergoing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Subjects surgically treated for prostate cancer were selected from 2 large population based prospective cohort studies, the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (enrolled 1994 to 1995) and the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (enrolled 2011 to 2012). Subjects completed baseline, 6-month and 12-month standardized patient reported outcome measures. Main outcomes were between-group differences in functional outcome scores at 6 and 12 months using linear regression, and adjusting for baseline function, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate outcomes between patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy within and across CEASAR and PCOS.  Results:   The combined cohort consisted of 2,438 men, 1,505 of whom underwent open radical prostatectomy and 933 of whom underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Men treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy reported better urinary function at 6 months (mean difference 3.77 points, 95% CI 1.09-6.44) but not at 12 months (1.19, -1.32-3.71). Subjects treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy also reported superior sexual function at 6 months (8.31, 6.02-10.56) and at 12 months (7.64, 5.25-10.03). Sensitivity analyses largely supported the sexual function findings with inconsistent support for urinary function results.

We evaluated whether the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted in-bore prostate biopsy correctly identifies the Gleason score of prostate cancer in histopathologic correlation after prostatectomy. Simultaneously a targeted concept is expected to keep down the rate of insignificant cancer.  Materials and methods:   We compared retrospectively the Gleason score of the MRI-targeted in-bore biopsy with prostatectomy specimens in 50 men with prostate cancer. Endorectal MRI included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and spectroscopy. Lesions with a prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score ≥3 were considered. Upgrading and downgrading of tumors was evaluated, and significant upgrading was defined as a shift in Gleason score from 6 to 7 or more.  Results:   Gleason score was concordant in 66% of the patients, overall upgraded in 30% of patients, and downgraded in 4% of patients. Significant upgrading of the Gleason score from 6 to 7 occurred in eight patients; upgrading did not exceed one step in the Gleason score. After prostatectomy the Gleason score 6 was found in 20% of patients. The median number of cores obtained was 4 (range 2-6), and the median number of positive cores was 2 (range 1-4).  Conclusions:   In-bore MRI-targeted biopsy offers good accuracy in the Gleason score with postprostatectomy histopathologic control when compared to the literature.

Constitutive activation of NF-κB has been observed in several types of cancers. Recently, it has been shown that inflammation and cancer are molecularly linked by means of NF-κB. During prostate cancer progression, NF-κB promotes cell survival, tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. NF-κB constitutive activation has been frequently demonstrated in primary prostate cancers and it correlates with loss of androgen receptor expression and castration-resistant phenotypes. Indeed, inhibition of NF-κB pathway may reduce the oncogenic effects mediated by chronic inflammatory response. Therefore, NF-κB represents a hopeful target for the treatment of prostate cancer due to its role in oncogenesis and chemoresistance.

Method:   A total of 189 consecutive cases of radical laparoscopic proctectomy were included. PANP was assessed visually or with INS. Urinary function was evaluated by residual urine volume (RUV), International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) and recatheterization rate. Erectile function was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scale.  Results:   INS successfully confirmed PANP in 65 (91.5%) patients, while direct vision confirmed PANP in only 72 (61.0%) patients.

Herein, we demonstrate that Stat5a/b induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC cells, as shown by Stat5a/b regulation of EMT marker expression (Twist1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin) in PC cell lines, xenograft tumors in vivo, and patient-derived PCs ex vivo using organ explant cultures. Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling induced functional end points of EMT as well, indicated by disruption of epithelial cell monolayers and increased migration and adhesion of PC cells to fibronectin. Knockdown of Twist1 suppressed Jak2-Stat5a/b-induced EMT properties of PC cells, which were rescued by re-introduction of Twist1, indicating that Twist1 mediates Stat5a/b-induced EMT in PC cells. While promoting EMT, Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling induced stem-like properties in PC cells, such as sphere formation and expression of cancer stem cell markers, including BMI1. Mechanistically, both Twist1 and BMI1 were critical for Stat5a/b induction of stem-like features, because genetic knockdown of Twist1 suppressed Stat5a/b-induced BMI1 expression and sphere formation in stem cell culture conditions, which were rescued by re-introduction of BMI1. By using human prolactin knock-in mice, we demonstrate that prolactin-Stat5a/b signaling promoted metastases formation of PC cells in vivo.

This study examined how overweight long-term survivors' symptom severity associated with comorbidity prior to a diet and exercise intervention was associated with post-intervention function and examined symptoms' effects on function through change in physical activity, diet quality, and weight status.  Materials and methods:   This is a secondary data analysis of 514 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors who participated in the one-year home-based diet and exercise intervention Reach-Out to Enhance Wellness trial. Measures included symptoms, weight, physical activity, diet quality, overall physical function (PF), and basic and advanced lower extremity function (BLEF and ALEF). Simple and serial mediation analyses were conducted to examine direct effects of symptom severity on PF, BLEF, and ALEF and indirect effects of symptom severity through changes in diet quality, physical activity, and weight.  Results:   Symptom severity was directly associated with lower functioning scores for PF (b=-0.63 p<0.001), BLEF (b=-0.33, p<0.001), and ALEF (b=-0.22, p<0.001). Indirect effects of symptom severity through weight loss, physical activity, and diet were not significant. Weight loss and physical activity were associated with higher PF and ALEF and diet quality was associated with higher BLEF.

Our objective is to validate such IBx-specific PCA3-based nomogram. We also aim to optimize the use of this nomogram in clinical practice through the definition of risk groups.  Methods:   Independent external validation. Clinical and biopsy data from a contemporary cohort of 401 men with the same inclusion criteria to those used to build up the reference's nomogram in IBx. The predictive value of the nomogram was assessed by means of calibration curves and discrimination ability through the area under the curve (AUC). Clinical utility of the nomogram was analyzed by choosing thresholds points that minimize the overlapping between probability density functions (PDF) in PCa and no PCa and HGPCa and no HGPCa groups, and net benefit was assessed by decision curves.  Results:   We detect 28% of PCa and 11 % of HGPCa in IBx, contrasting to the 46 and 20% at the reference series. Due to this, there is an overestimation of the nomogram probabilities shown in the calibration curve for PCa. The AUC values are 0.736 for PCa (C.I.95%:0.68-0.79) and 0.786 for HGPCa (C.I.95%:0.71-0.87) showing an adequate discrimination ability. PDF show differences in the distributions of nomogram probabilities in PCa and not PCa patient groups. A minimization of the overlapping between these curves confirms the threshold probability of harboring PCa >30 % proposed by Hansen is useful to indicate a IBx, but a cut-off > 40% could be better in series of opportunistic screening like ours. Similar results appear in HGPCa analysis. The decision curve also shows a net benefit of 6.31% for the threshold probability of 40%.  Conclusions:   PCA3 is an useful tool to select patients for IBx.

Objective:   We conducted a hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis to evaluate the relationship between short-course ADT and CVM in patients with clinically localized PCa enrolled in a phase III trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1979 men with clinically localized (T1b-2b, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <20 ng/ml) PCa enrolled in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-08 from 1994 to 2001. Patients were randomized to radiation therapy (RT) with or without short-course ADT (4 mo of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy and antiandrogen). Median follow-up was 9.1 yr for survivors.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The Cox proportional hazards model assessed overall survival. The Fine-Gray proportional hazards model assessed disease-specific survival (DSS) and CVM. Covariates included age, race, weight, baseline cardiovascular disease, baseline diabetes, baseline hypertension, Gleason score, T stage, and PSA.  Results and limitations:   Short-course ADT improved overall survival and DSS and was not associated with an increased risk of CVM. Overall, 191 cardiovascular-related deaths were observed. At 10 yr, 83 patients (cumulative incidence rate: 10%) receiving RT and ADT versus 95 patients (cumulative incidence rate: 11%) receiving RT alone experienced CVM. The treatment arm was not associated with increased CVM (unadjusted hazard ratio: 1.07; confidence interval, 0.81-1.42; p=0.62). Increased CVM was not observed in patients at low risk of PCa death or at high risk of cardiac-related death.  Conclusions:   Data from patients enrolled in RTOG 94-08 support the hypothesis that ADT does not increase CVM risk in men with clinically localized PCa treated with short-course GnRH agonist therapy. These data support ADT use in settings with proven survival benefit.  Patient summary:   We investigated the controversial relationship between hormone therapy and cardiovascular mortality in men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiation in a large randomized trial.

Image classification approaches have been developed to identify and classify glandular regions in digital images of prostate tissues; however their success has been limited by difficulties in cellular segmentation and tissue heterogeneity. We hypothesized that utilizing image pixels to generate intensity histograms of hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) stains deconvoluted from H&E images numerically captures the architectural difference between glands and stroma. In addition, we postulated that joint histograms of local binary patterns and local variance (LBPxVAR) can be used as sensitive textural features to differentiate benign/normal tissue from cancer. Here we utilized a machine learning approach comprising of a support vector machine (SVM) followed by a random forest (RF) classifier to digitally stratify prostate tissue into ST, BN and PCa areas. Two pathologists manually annotated 210 images of low- and high-grade tumors from slides that were selected from 20 radical prostatectomies and digitized at high-resolution. The 210 images were split into the training (n=19) and test (n=191) sets. Local intensity histograms of H and E were used to train a SVM classifier to separate ST from epithelium (BN+PCa). The performance of SVM prediction was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of delineating epithelial areas. The Jaccard J=59.5 ± 14.6 and Rand Ri=62.0 ± 7.5 indices reported a significantly better prediction when compared to a reference method (Chen et al., Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:18) based on the averaged values from the test set. To distinguish BN from PCa we trained a RF classifier with LBPxVAR and local intensity histograms and obtained separate performance values for BN and PCa: JBN=35.2 ± 24.9, OBN=49.6 ± 32, JPCa=49.5 ± 18.5, OPCa=72.7 ± 14.8 and Ri=60.6 ± 7.6 in the test set. Our pixel-based classification does not rely on the detection of lumens, which is prone to errors and has limitations in high-grade cancers and has the potential to aid in clinical studies in which the quantification of tumor content is necessary to prognosticate the course of the disease. The image data set with ground truth annotation is available for public use to stimulate further research in this area.""","""['Arkadiusz Gertych', 'Nathan Ing', 'Zhaoxuan Ma', 'Thomas J Fuchs', 'Sadri Salman', 'Sambit Mohanty', 'Sanica Bhele', 'Adriana Velásquez-Vacca', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Beatrice S Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Kernel-based learning from both qualitative and quantitative labels: application to prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric MR imaging.', 'Combined unsupervised-supervised classification of multiparametric PET/MRI data: application to prostate cancer.', 'Machine learning study of several classifiers trained with texture analysis features to differentiate benign from malignant soft-tissue tumors in T1-MRI images.', 'Implementing Machine Learning in Radiology Practice and Research.', 'Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the prostate cancer cell nucleus.', 'Virtual Microscopy Goes Global: The Images Are Virtual and the Problems Are Real.', 'Lipid Nanoparticles as a Shuttle for Anti-Adipogenic miRNAs to Human Adipocytes.', 'Predicting IHC staining classes of NF1 using features in the hematoxylin channel.', 'A statistical, voxelised model of prostate cancer for biologically optimised radiotherapy.', 'Application of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Vision & Learning for the Development of a Live Single-cell Phenotypic Biomarker Test to Predict Prostate Cancer Tumor Aggressiveness.']"""

The entity is characterized by the appearance of multiple cyst-like, blood-filled spaces within the liver parenchyma.  Case presentation:   A 77-year-old Japanese man with prostate cancer was referred to our department because he was diagnosed as having two hepatic tumors. The tumors were confirmed to be peliosis hepatis by repeated needle biopsies and because of their atypical images by enhanced computed tomography and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Later these tumors grew rapidly, increased in number, and disseminated throughout his whole liver. We are now treating the patient conservatively due to his age and his existing medical conditions.

Methods and materials:   The prospective study cohort comprised 6595 consecutively treated men with T1-4 N0M0 PC whose treatment included brachytherapy between October 16, 1997, and May 28, 2013. Fine and Gray competing risk regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the risks of PCSM and ACM in men with high, unfavorable intermediate, and favorable intermediate risk as compared with low-risk PC.  Results:   After median followup of 7.76 years, 820 men died (12.43%): 72 of PC (8.78%). Men with favorable intermediate-risk PC did not have significantly increased PCSM risk as compared with men with low-risk PC (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56, 2.88; p-Value 0.58), whereas men with high-risk PC (AHR, 3.74; 95% CI 1.12, 12.53; p-Value 0.032) and unfavorable intermediate-risk PC (AHR, 3.10; 95% CI 1.43, 6.72; p-Value 0.004) did. Based on 10-year adjusted point estimates of PCSM and ACM for men with high-risk PC being 6.01% (95% CI 3.79%, 8.94%) and 21.30% (95% CI 17.45%, 25.42%), respectively, PCSM comprised 28% of ACM.  Conclusions:   In the setting of external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy, men with high-risk PC have low absolute adjusted estimates of PCSM (~6%) during the first decade after treatment despite receiving only short-course ADT.

Aim:   To describe the incidence and main characteristics of malignancies developed in patients who underwent kidney transplantation in Budapest between 1973 and 2014.  Methods:   During this period, the essential data for PTTs were repeatedly evaluated. In this study, the results from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2006, and 2013 were evaluated.  Results:   Incidence of PTTs increased from 2.3% to 11.1%. Male/female ratio was 2:1. Skin, native kidney, and lung cancers were the most common tumors during the entire observation period. Lymphoma was seen rarely at the beginning and became common in 2013. The same was observed in the most frequent general population tumors (colorectal, breast, hepatic, prostate, gastric cancer, and malignant melanoma) where the occurrence increased in the last 10 years. Mean age of patients increased from 35.7 to 56.5 years. During the last 20 years, age of recipients increased: above 50 years from 22.9% to 40.5%, and above 60 years from 8.2% to 23.1%. Patient survival was different according to tumor stage at discovering, i.e. renal cell carcinoma was usually discovered in stage I. resulting in a 66.1% 5-year survival rate, whereas 43.5% of colorectal cancers were diagnosed in stage IV, with a 13.9% 5-year survival rate.

We sought to determine whether it is possible to expand the morning sampling window for measurement of TT.

Differences in TT levels were evident across five blood draw time windows (p = < 0.0001) and persisted after adjustment for age and BMI. TT levels in blood drawn from 2 to 5 PM (344.3 ng/dl) and 5 to 8 PM (334.4 ng/dl) differed significantly from that drawn from 8 to 11 AM (p < 0.05), while TT levels from 11 AM to 2 PM (396.5 ng/dl) and 8 PM to 8 AM (373.4 ng/dl) did not (p = 0.90 and 0.73, respectively).

Here, we demonstrate that metformin plays an anti-tumor role via repressing N-cadherin, independent of AMPK, in wild-type N-cadherin cancer cells. Ectopic-expression of N-cadherin develops metformin-resistant cancer cells, while suppression of N-cadherin sensitizes cancer to metformin. Manipulation of AMPK expression does not alter sensitivity of cancer to metformin. We show that NF-kappaB is a downstream molecule of N-cadherin and metformin regulates NF-kappaB signaling via suppressing N-cadherin. Moreover, we also suggest that TWIST1 is an upstream molecule of N-cadherin/NF-kappaB signaling and manipulation of TWIST1 expression changes the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin. In contrast to the cells that express N-cadherin, in N-cadherin deficient cells, metformin plays an anti-tumor role via activation of AMPK. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin makes cancer more resistant to metformin. Therefore, we suggest that metformin's anti-cancer therapeutic effect is mediated through different molecular mechanism in wild-type vs. deficient N-cadherin cancer cells. At last, we selected 49 out of 984 patients' samples with prostatic cancer after radical prostatectomy (selection criteria: Gleason score ≥ 7 and all patients taking metformin) and showed levels of N-cadherin, p65 and AMPK could predict post-surgical recurrence in prostate cancer after treatment of metformin.""","""['Rongbin Ge', 'Zongwei Wang', 'Shulin Wu', 'Yangjia Zhuo', 'Aleksandar G Otsetov', 'Chao Cai', 'Weide Zhong', 'Chin-Lee Wu', 'Aria F Olumi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The phenomenon of acquired resistance to metformin in breast cancer cells: The interaction of growth pathways and estrogen receptor signaling.', 'Growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonist inhibits the invasiveness of human endometrial cancer cells by down-regulating twist and N-cadherin expression.', 'A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'A review for clinicians: Prostate cancer and the antineoplastic properties of metformin.', 'Metabolic roles of AMPK and metformin in cancer cells.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'Metformin mitigates PLCε gene expression and modulates the Notch1/Hes and androgen receptor signaling pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer xenograft models.', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules in Plasticity and Metastasis.']"""

In the present study, we evaluated the role of NLR in men who underwent prostate needle biopsy for their initial diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. Both complete blood counts and free/total (F/T) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio were examined in a total of 3,011 men in our institution. Of these, 1,207 had a PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL, and 357 of 810 who subsequently underwent prostate needle biopsy were found to have prostatic adenocarcinoma.

NLR was also significantly higher in men with positive biopsy than in those with negative biopsy (p < 0.001). Using NLR cut-off point of 2.40 determined by the AUROC curve, positive/negative predictive values of NLR alone and NLR combined with F/T PSA ratio (cut-off: 0.15) were 56.6%/60.8% and 80.7%/60.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that not only F/T PSA ratio (HR = 3.13) but also NLR (HR = 2.21) was an independent risk factor for prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Calculation of relative survival rates of prostate cancer patients from a regional cancer registry using diagnosis year and stage, based on differential mortality tables.  Results:   Calculation of relative survival for all prostate cancer patients shows a very slight excess mortality after 5 years compared to a matched general population. Introduction of new imaging techniques and PSA screening led to a change in the distribution of diagnosed stages. Differentiation by stage is therefore essential. Thus, patients with UICC stage I, II, and III have a very low excess mortality, while patients with a UICC stage IV have a significantly higher excess mortality; however, it is very surprising that the excess mortality of patients without specification of the UICC stage is similarly unfavorable as in the case of patients with UICC stage IV.  Conclusion:   If data from a regional cancer registry are used, adequate mortality tables from the catchment area of the registry should be used as a reference due to regional mortality differences. Thus, progress in patient survival can be more precisely mapped.

We used chi-square and Wilcoxon tests to examine the association between factors and initiation of AS. Logistic regression models were fit for D'Amico risk categories. Measures of model discrimination and calibration were estimated, including area under the curve (AUC) and Brier score (BS).  Results:   Patient age, Gleason score, clinical T-stage, urology practice, and tumor volume (greatest percent of a core involved with cancer and proportion of positive cores) were associated with the decision to choose AS in the intermediate-risk cohort (AUC = 0.875, BS = 0.07) and the complete cohort (AUC = 0.89, BS = 0.10).

Conclusions:   This represents the first study of pLND in the setting of nodal oligometastatic PCa detected by (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The use of (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT could be to improve the accuracy for the detection of nodal micrometastases.

Although studies suggest the cytokine family might be associated with BPH and PCa, there has been no systematic comparisons of expression of IL-17A, E, F and their receptors, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and changes in structural cells in PCa and BPH.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was employed to evaluate immunoreactivity for IL-17A, E, F and their receptors IL-17RA, IL-17BR, and IL-17CR, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and changes in structural cells including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells in prostate tissues from subjects with PCa or BPH as well as controls.  Results:   Immunostaining showed that expression of immunoreactivity for IL-17A, IL-17RA, IL-17E, and IL-17F was significantly elevated in prostatic tissue from BPH and PCa compared with that in controls, which was accompanied by increased numbers of infiltrating inflammatory cells and CD31(+) blood vessels. Compared with BPH, PCa was characterized by reduced immunoreactivity for IL-17BR and reduced numbers of CD68(+) macrophages, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, although there was a trend for these changes to correlate with disease severity in both PCa and BPH.  Conclusion:   Our data are compatible with hypothesis that IL-17A acting through IL-17RA, but not IL-17CR contribute to the pathogenesis of BPH and PCa. In contrast, IL-17E interacting with the IL-17BR might have an anti-tumor effect.""","""['Yanbo Liu', 'Xiaohui Zhao', 'Xuemei Sun', 'Yongmei Li', 'Zhenjiang Wang', 'Jing Jiang', 'Huiming Han', 'Weigao Shen', 'Chris J Corrigan', 'Ying Sun']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Expression Levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA, and IL-17RC in Prostate Cancer with Taking into Account the Histological Grade according to Gleason Scale in Comparison to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: In Search of New Therapeutic Options.', 'Immune analysis of expression of IL-17 relative ligands and their receptors in bladder cancer: comparison with polyp and cystitis.', 'Expression and location of IL-17A, E, F and their receptors in colorectal adenocarcinoma: Comparison with benign intestinal disease.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Prostate stem cells in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer: emerging role and concepts.', 'The effect of 5-α reductase inhibitor on Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell-related inflammatory response in BPH.', 'New insights into the function of Interleukin-25 in disease pathogenesis.', 'IL-17A promotes Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis via interactions with IL-17RC.', 'Variable roles of interleukin-17F in different cancers.', 'Interleukin-25: New perspective and state-of-the-art in cancer prognosis and treatment approaches.']"""

We therefore examined childhood and adult body size in relation to total incident prostate cancer and prognostic subtypes in a prospective cohort of 47,491 US men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We assessed adult height, body mass index (BMI) in early and middle-to-late adulthood, adult waist circumference, and body shape at age 10. With follow-up from 1986 to 2010, we estimated the relative risk (RR) of prostate cancer using Cox proportional hazards models. We identified 6,183 incident cases. Tallness was associated with increased risk of advanced-stage tumors, particularly fatal disease (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.23-2.23, highest vs. lowest quintile, ptrend < 0.001). High BMI at age 21 was inversely associated with total prostate cancer (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, BMI ≥ 26 vs. 20-21.9, ptrend = 0.01) and with fatal and advanced disease. The association for late adult BMI differed by age (pinteraction < 0.001); high BMI was inversely associated with total prostate cancer (RR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.78, BMI ≥ 30 vs. 21-22.9, ptrend <0.001) and with non-advanced and less aggressive tumors among men ≤ 65 years, whereas no association was seen among men >65 years. Adult waist circumference was weakly inversely associated with less aggressive disease. Childhood obesity was unclearly related to risk. Our study confirms tall men to be at increased risk of fatal and advanced prostate cancer. The influence of adiposity varies by prognostic disease subtype and by age. The relationship between body size and prostate cancer is complex. Body size changes progressively throughout life and consequent effects on prostate cancer risk may be associated with related changes in hormonal and metabolic pathways. This large prospective study examined potential associations between the risk of various prostate cancer subtypes and multiple anthropometric measures at different ages in men. Tallness was confirmed to be associated with an elevated risk of advanced prostate cancer, particularly fatal disease.

In this paper, a novel approach called ScAPSA (Scoring Adherence to Prostatic Surgical Aims) is proposed to assess surgical proficiency, considering surgical success as perfect adherence to a correct surgical plan, and not related solely to clinical outcomes.  Methods:   In order to define (and quantify) such adherence, and to evaluate both learning curves and surgeons' skill, a 20-point scoring system has been developed. The specific surgical plan (improved with predictive tools) is compared with pathological findings to identify any surgical errors. Adding data on postoperative complications, a score from 0 (better) to 20 (worst surgical result) can easily be calculated. Considering the number of reported cases needed to complete the RARP learning curve, we decided to analyze the first 25 consecutive single-surgeon RARPs.  Results:   Testing ScAPSA on the first consecutive (initial learning curve) single-surgeon RARPs confirmed that this tool can faithfully describe and quantify both learning curves and surgical skill.  Conclusions:   ScAPSA may represent a useful novel tool, not only for describing RARP learning curves objectively, but also for determining and quantifying success rates, allowing surgeons to check intra-operative errors and monitor their own surgical proficiency.

In addition, we conducted guided interviews about the process of developing information materials with decision-makers of cancer institutes.  Results:   Overall, major discrepancies in cancer screening recommendations exist among the Austrian, German, and Swiss cancer institutes. Process evaluation revealed that crucial steps of quality assurance, such as assembling a multi-disciplinary panel, assessing conflicts of interest, or transparency regarding funding sources, have frequently not been undertaken. All information materials had substantial quality deficits in multiple areas. Three out of four institutes issued information materials that met fewer than half of the quality criteria.

Oncotyrol is funded through the COMET Excellence Program by the Austrian government via the national Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). This article focuses on the role of health technology assessment (HTA) and outcomes research in personalized cancer medicine in the context of Oncotyrol.  Methods:   Oncotyrol, which currently comprises approximately 20 individual projects, has four research areas: Area 1: Biomarker and Drug Target Identification; Area 2: Assay Development and Drug Screening; Area 3: Innovative Therapies; Area 4: Health Technology Assessment and Bioinformatics. Area 4 translates the results from Areas 1 to 3 to populations and society and reports them back to Area 3 to inform clinical studies and guidelines, and to Areas 1 and 2 to guide further research and development.  Results:   In a series of international expert workshops, the Oncotyrol International Expert Task Force for Personalized Cancer Medicine developed the Methodological Framework for Early Health Technology Assessment and Decision Modeling in Cancer and practical guidelines in this field. Further projects included applications in the fields of sequential treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness evaluation of prostate cancer screening, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple cervical cancer screening strategies, and benefits and cost-effectiveness of genomic test-based treatment strategies in breast cancer.  Conclusion:   An interdisciplinary setting as generated in Oncotyrol provides unique opportunities such as systematically coordinating lab and bench research, product development, clinical studies and decision science/HTA and transparent joint planning of research and development with a partnership of researchers, manufacturers and health policy decision makers. However, generating a joint research and legal framework with numerous partners from different sectors can be challenging, particularly in the starting period of such an endeavor.

Using a set of transverse US images, image processing and random sample consensus are used to locate the needle within each image and estimate the needle shape. The method is validated with an in vitro needle insertion setup and a transparent tissue phantom, where two orthogonal cameras are used to capture the true 3-D needle shape for verification. Results showed that the use of at least three images obtained at 75% of the maximum insertion depth or greater allows for maximum needle shape estimation errors of less than 2 mm.

Acetylation of KLF5 has been shown to reverse the transcriptional activity of KLF5 in human epidermal cells and prostate cancer cells. Whether Klf5 acetylation contributes to the lineage specification in the blastocyst and pluripotency maintenance in ESCs remains unexplored. Here, we showed the ubiquitous expression of acetylated Klf5 in the ICM and the trophectoderm, ruling out the possibility that differential acetylation status of Klf5 leads to the lineage specification in the blastocyst. We found that K358Q mutation, mimicking acetylation, enhances the transcriptional activity of Klf5 for pluripotency genes in ESCs, and that K358Q Klf5 is more potent in pluripotency maintenance and in somatic cell reprogramming, compared to K358R Klf5. In ESCs, Klf5 acetylation, stimulated by TGF-β signaling, is involved in enhancing Sox2 expression. Moreover, upon ESC differentiation, acetylation of Klf5 facilitates the suppression of many differentiation genes, except for that K358Q Klf5 activates Cdx2, promoting trophectodermal differentiation. In summary, our results revealed the regulatory functions of Klf5 acetylation in ESC self-renewal and differentiation.""","""['Tong Zhao', 'Chang Liu', 'Lingyi Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Regulatory role of Klf5 in early mouse development and in embryonic stem cells.', 'Krüppel-like factor 5 is essential for blastocyst development and the normal self-renewal of mouse ESCs.', 'Klf5 regulates lineage formation in the pre-implantation mouse embryo.', 'Klf5 is involved in self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.', 'Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Pluripotency and Self-Renewal of Embryonic Stem Cells.', 'Krüppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Krüppel-like factor (KLF)5: An emerging foe of cardiovascular health.', 'Acetylation of KLF5 maintains EMT and tumorigenicity to cause chemoresistant bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Follistatin treatment modifies DNA methylation of the CDX2 gene in bovine preimplantation embryos.', 'Concise Review: Regulation of Self-Renewal in Normal and Malignant Hematopoietic Stem Cells by Krüppel-Like Factor 4.']"""

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to identify 328,904 men diagnosed with clinicalT1 (cT1)-4N0M0 prostate cancer between 2004 and 2010. A multivariate Fine-Gray competing risks regression analysis was used to determine PCSM as a function of the PSA level (≤ 2.5, 2.6-4, 4.1-10, 10.1-20, 20.1-40, or > 40 ng/mL) and GS (8-10 vs ≤ 7).  Results:   The median follow-up was 38 months. Among men with GS 8-10 disease, with a PSA level of 4.1 to 10 ng/mL as the referent, the adjusted hazard ratio for PCSM for men was 2.15 with a PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-2.79; P < .001), 1.60 with a PSA level of 2.6 to 4 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.22-2.10; P = .001), 1.60 with a PSA level of 10.1 to 20 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.41-1.82; P < .001), 2.08 with a PSA level of 20.1 to 40 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.81-2.38; P < .001), and 3.23 with a PSA level > 40 ng/mL (95% CI, 2.85-3.65; P < .001). This suggested a U-shaped distribution. There was a significant interaction between the PSA level and GS (P(interaction) < .001) such that only a PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL significantly predicted poorer PCSM among patients with GS 8-10 disease.  Conclusions:   Among patients with high-grade disease, patients with PSA levels ≤ 2.5 ng/mL or PSA levels of 2.6 to 4 ng/mL appear to have a higher risk for cancer-specific death in comparison with patients with PSA levels of 10.1 to 20 ng/mL, and this supports the notion that low PSA levels in GS 8-10 disease may be a sign of aggressive and very poorly differentiated or anaplastic low PSA-producing tumors.

Previous work in our lab identified a novel nuclear export signal (NES) (NES(AR)) in AR ligand-binding domain essential for AR nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. By characterizing the localization of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged NES(AR), we designed and executed a yeast mutagenesis screen and isolated 7 yeast mutants that failed to display the NES(AR) export function. One of those mutants was identified as the splicing factor pre-mRNA processing factor 8 (Prp8). We further showed that Prp8 could regulate NES(AR) function using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Prp8 coupled with a rapamycin export assay in mammalian cells and knockdown of Prp8 could induce nuclear accumulation of GFP-tagged AR in PC3 cells. Prp8 expression was decreased in castration-resistant LuCaP35 xenograft tumors as compared with androgen-sensitive xenografts. Laser capture microdissection and quantitative PCR showed Prp8 mRNA levels were decreased in human prostate cancer specimens with high Gleason scores. In prostate cancer cells, coimmunoprecipitation and deletion mutagenesis revealed a physical interaction between Prp8 and AR mainly mediated by NES(AR). Luciferase assay with prostate specific antigen promoter-driven reporter demonstrated that Prp8 regulated AR transcription activity in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, Prp8 knockdown also increased polyubiquitination of endogenous AR. This may be 1 possible mechanism by which it modulates AR activity.

This study aimed to compile national cancer incidences and mortalities in 2011 and estimate cancer incident new cases and cancer deaths.  Methods:   In 2014, there were 234 cancer registries that submitted records of new cancer cases and cancer deaths that occurred in 2011 to the NCCR. All datasets were evaluated based on the criteria of data quality of the NCCR. The data of 177 registries was of sufficient quality and was compiled to evaluate cancer statistics in 2011. The pooled data were stratified by area, sex, age group, and cancer type. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using age-standardized rates (ASR) and the Chinese population. All incidences and mortalities were age-standardized to the 2000 Chinese standard population and Segi's population.  Results:   The estimates of new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 3,372,175 and 2,113,048 in 2011, respectively. The crude incidence was 250.28/1,00,000 (277.77/1,00,000 for males and 221.37/1,00,000 for females). The ASRs of incidence by the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and by the world standard population (ASRIW) were 186.34/1,00,000 and 182.76/1,00,000, respectively, with a cumulative incidence (0-74 years old) of 21.20%. Cancers of the lung, female breast, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, cervix, uterus, prostate, and ovary were the most common cancers, accounting for approximately 75% of all new cancer cases. Lung, liver, gastric, esophageal, colorectal, female breast, pancreatic, brain, and cervical cancers and leukemia were the leading causes of cancer death, accounting for approximately 80% of all cancer deaths. Cancer incidence, mortality, and spectrum were all different between urban and rural areas and between males and females.  Conclusions:   The population covered by the cancer registries greatly increased from 2010 to 2011. The data quality and representativeness of cancer registries have gradually improved. Cancer registries have an irreplaceable role in research on cancer prevention and control. The disease burden of cancer is increasing, and the health department must implement effective measures to contain the increased cancer burden in China.""","""['Wanqing Chen', 'Rongshou Zheng', 'Hongmei Zeng', 'Siwei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chin J Cancer""","""['Annual report on status of cancer in China, 2011.', 'National cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2012.', 'Report of cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2010.', 'Current status and progress of pancreatic cancer in China.', 'Pneumonia incidence and mortality in Mainland China: systematic review of Chinese and English literature, 1985-2008.', 'Salidroside regulates tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer via Hsp70/Stub1/Foxp3 pathway in Tregs.', 'Preoperative serum bilirubin is an independent prognostic factor for curatively resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'APOC1 predicts a worse prognosis for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with tumor immune infiltration during tumorigenesis.', ""Interval time between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in advanced gastric cancer doesn't affect outcome: A meta analysis."", 'Whole-Exome Sequencing Among Chinese Patients With Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer.']"""

It is injected to increase the distance between the prostate and rectum. During the course of external radiotherapy treatment, physiological changes in rectal volume exist. When using polyethylene glycol material, such as DuraSeal(®) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), gel resorption also occurs. Together, these factors alter the original dose plan distribution.  Methods:   External dose planning and calculations were simulated using images acquired from 10 patients who were treated with brachytherapy and gel. The CT series was taken relative to gel injection: pre 1 day, post 1 day, post 1 month and post 2 months. Adaptive planning was compared with a single plan.  Results:   Adaptive planning shows better results compared with the single plan used in the total treatment course; however, the effect is minor.  Conclusion:   Gel usage is clearly favourable to rectal DVH. Using adaptive planning with gel improves rectal DVH but is not necessary according to this study.  Advances in knowledge:   Spacer gel is used in prostate radiotherapy to increase distance between the prostate and the rectum, thus reducing the rectal doses. During the treatment course, gel resorption exists which affects the rectal doses.

Design:   GPs reviewed 24 video-vignettes and case notes on patients with cancer symptoms and indicated whether they would refer the patient and/or prescribe medication, and/or undertake further investigation. According to available guidelines, all cases warranted a referral to a specialist or further investigations.  Setting:   Australian primary care sector.

Results:   In more than one-in-eight cases, the patient was not investigated or referred. Patient management varied significantly by cancer type (p<0.001). For two key reasons, colorectal cancer was the chosen referent category. First, it represents a prevalent type of cancer. Second, in this study, colorectal cancer symptoms were managed in a similar proportion of options-that is, prescription, referral or investigation.

They were less likely to manage prostate cancer with a 'prescription only', yet more likely to manage it with a 'referral with investigation'. With regard to pancreatic and cervical cancers, participants were more likely to manage these with a 'referral only' or a 'referral with investigation'.

Complexation of curcumin with metals has gained attention in recent years for improvement of its stability. In this study, the effect of gallium curcumin and gallium diacetylcurcumin on the structure, function and oxidative stability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme were evaluated by spectroscopic techniques. In addition to the enzymatic investigation, the cytotoxic effect of the complexes was assessed on bladder, MCF-7 breast cancer and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines by MTT assay. Furthermore, antibacterial activity of the complexes against S. aureus and E. coli was explored by dilution test method. The results showed that the complexes improve activity of HRP and also increase its tolerance against the oxidative condition. After addition of the complexes, affinity of HRP for hydrogen peroxide substrate decreases, while the affinity increases for phenol substrate. Circular dichroism, intrinsic and synchronous fluorescence spectra showed that the enzyme structure around the catalytic heme group becomes less compact and also the distance between the heme group and tryptophan residues increases due to binding of the complexes to HRP. On the whole, it can be concluded that the change in the enzyme structure upon binding to the gallium curcumin and gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes results in an increase in the antioxidant efficiency and activity of the peroxidise enzyme. The result of anticancer and antibacterial activities suggested that the complexes exhibit the potential for cancer treatment, but they have no significant antibacterial activity.""","""['Parisa Jahangoshaei', 'Leila Hassani', 'Fakhrossadat Mohammadi', 'Akram Hamidi', 'Khosro Mohammadi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Biol Inorg Chem""","""['Erratum to: Investigating the effect of gallium curcumin and gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes on the structure, function and oxidative stability of the peroxidase enzyme and their anticancer and antibacterial activities.', 'The biological effects of vanadyl curcumin and vanadyl diacetylcurcumin complexes: the effect on structure, function and oxidative stability of the peroxidase enzyme, antibacterial activity and cytotoxic effect.', 'Erratum to: Investigating the effect of gallium curcumin and gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes on the structure, function and oxidative stability of the peroxidase enzyme and their anticancer and antibacterial activities.', 'Synthesis and characterization of dual function vanadyl, gallium and indium curcumin complexes for medicinal applications.', 'Lanthanum, Gallium and their Impact on Oxidative Stress.', 'Chemical and structural features influencing the biological activity of curcumin.', 'Curcumin-Based β-Diketo Ligands for Ga3+: Thermodynamic Investigation of Potential Metal-Based Drugs.', 'Metal-Curcumin Complexes in Therapeutics: An Approach to Enhance Pharmacological Effects of Curcumin.', 'Role of Curcumin and (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-Gallate in Bladder Cancer Treatment: A Review.']"""

Higher expression of CRISP-3 has been linked to poor prognosis and hence it has been thought to act as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer. It is proposed to have a role in innate immunity but its role in prostate cancer is still unknown. In order to understand its function, its expression was stably knocked down in LNCaP cells. CRISP-3 knockdown did not affect cell viability but resulted in reduced invasiveness. Global gene expression changes upon CRISP-3 knockdown were identified by microarray analysis. Microarray data were quantitatively validated by evaluating the expression of seven candidate genes in three independent stable clones. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes identified cell adhesion, cell motility, and ion transport to be affected among other biological processes. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA, also known as Kallikrein 3) was the top most downregulated gene whose expression was also validated at protein level. Interestingly, expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a known anti-inflammatory protein, was upregulated upon CRISP-3 knockdown.

Design:   Serum samples were collected in this pilot study from a randomized placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical trial (Watchful Waiting (WW)).  Setting:   Subjects were followed every three months for up to five years at the University of Arizona Prostate Cancer Prevention Program.  Participants:   One hundred and forty men (age < 85 years) had biopsy-proven prostate cancer, a Gleason sum score less than eight, no metastatic cancer, and no prior treatment for prostate cancer.  Intervention:   As part of the WW trial, men were randomized to placebo, selenium 200 μg/day or selenium 800 μg/day. For the purpose of the current study, 40 subjects enrolled in the WW study (20 from the placebo group and 20 from Se 800 μg/day group) were selected.  Measurements:   Baseline serum samples were collected at each follow-up visit and stored at -80 degrees Celsius. A multiplexed proteomic panel investigated changes in 120 proteins markers simultaneously.  Results:   Thirteen proteins (Apolipoprotein J, IL-10, IL-1 alpha, MMP-3, IL-12p70, IL-2 receptor alpha, cathepsin B, eotaxin, EGFR, FGF-basic, myeloperoxidase, RANTES, TGF-beta) were determined to be either statistically (p-value < 0.05) or marginally significantly (0.05 < p-value <0.1) changed in the selenium supplemented group as compared to placebo.  Conclusion:   Although independent validation of these results is needed, this study is the first of its kind to utilize high throughput fluorescence based protein multiplex panel in analyzing changes in the proteomic profile due to selenium supplementation.

We have optimized here for the first time a combination of AgNOR morphological denominators that would reflect best the differences between these pathologies. The analysis of AgNORs' roundness, averaged from large composite images, revealed clear-cut lower values in adenocarcinomas compared to benign and atypical lesions but with no differences between different Gleason scores. Fractal dimension (FD) of AgNOR silhouettes not only revealed significant lower values for global cancer images compared to AAH and BNH images, but was also able to differentiate between Gleason pattern 2 and Gleason patterns 3-5 adenocarcinomas. Plotting the frequency distribution of the FDs for different pathologies showed clear differences between all Gleason patterns and BNH.

Our previous study showed that curcumin inhibits androgen receptor (AR) through modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in LNCaP cells. Therefore, we investigated the in vivo effects of curcumin by using LNCaP xenografts.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP cells were subcutaneously inoculated in Balb/c nude mice. When the tumor volume reached greater than 100 mm(3), either curcumin (500 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle was administered through oral gavage three times weekly for 4 weeks. The expression of AR and intermediate products of Wnt/β-catenin were assessed.  Results:   Curcumin had an inhibitory effect on tumor growth during the early period, which was followed by a slow increase in growth over time. Tumor growth was delayed about 27% in the curcumin group. The mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in the curcumin group was approximately twice that in the untreated group. Curcumin significantly decreased AR expression at both the mRNA and protein level. The PSA levels tended to be reduced in the curcumin group. However, there were no significant changes in expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway intermediates.  Conclusions:   This study revealed that curcumin initially interferes with prostate cancer growth by inhibiting AR activity and possibly by reducing PSA expression.

Materials and methods:   From March 2008 to February 2013, 245 prostate cancer patients with a Gleason score ≤7 were treated with 125-I LDR brachytherapy. Among them, 178 patients with prostate volume 20-35 mL and a follow-up period ≥6 months were evaluated for radiation proctitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for a prebrachytherapy evaluation, and prostate-rectum distance and prostate longitudinal length were measured. The radiation proctitis was confirmed and graded via colonoscopy based on the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) toxicity criteria.  Results:   Twenty-three patients received a colonoscopy for proctitis evaluation, and 12 were identified as grade 1 on the RTOG scale. Nine patients were diagnosed as grade 2 and 2 patients were grade 3. No patient developed grade 4 proctitis. The rectal-complication group had a mean prostate-rectum distance of 2.51±0.16 mm, while non-rectal-complication control group had 3.32±0.31 mm. The grade 1 proctitis patients had a mean prostate-rectum distance of 2.80±0.15 mm, which was significantly longer than 2.12±0.31 mm of grades 2 and 3 patient groups (p=0.045). All 11 patients of grades 2 and 3 had a prostate longitudinal length of 35.22±2.50 mm, which was longer than group 1, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.214).

The patients were classified into two groups: the nonstatin use group (A group) and the statin use group (B group). Multivariate analysis was performed on statin use and other factors considered likely to have an effect on the time to progression to CRPC.  Results:   The mean patient age was 67.1±9.1 years, and the mean follow-up period was 52 months. The mean initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 537 ng/mL.

By use of the modified Gleason criteria, the tumor grade of the surgical specimens was examined and compared with the biopsy results.  Results:   Tumor upgrading occurred in 24 patients (40.0%). Extracapsular disease and positive surgical margins were found in 6 patients (10.0%) and 8 patients (17.30%), respectively. A statistically significant correlation between PSA density and postoperative upgrading was found (p=0.030); this was in contrast with the other studied parameters, which failed to reach significance, including PSA, prostate volume, number of biopsy cores, and number of positive cores. Tumor upgrading was also highly associated with extracapsular cancer extension (p=0.000).

We hypothesize that genetic variants of the autophagy pathway may influence clinical outcomes in prostate cancer patients. We genotyped 40 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 7 core autophagy pathway genes in 458 localized prostate cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the independent association of each SNP with disease progression. Positive findings were then replicated in an independent cohort of 504 advanced prostate cancer patients. After adjusting for known clinicopathologic factors, the association between ATG16L1 rs78835907 and recurrence in localized disease [hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.90, P = 0.006] was replicated in more advanced disease (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95, P = 0.014). Additional integrated in silico analysis suggests that rs78835907 tends to affect ATG16L1 expression, which in turn is correlated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis.

B3 inhibited the in vivo growth of tumors derived from PC3 cells and ex vivo human PCa explants. We identified a novel mechanism by which KDM4B activates the transcription of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). B3 blocked the binding of KDM4B to the PLK1 promoter. Our studies suggest a potential mechanism-based therapeutic strategy for PCa and tumors with elevated KDM4B/PLK1 expression.""","""['Lingling Duan', 'Ganesha Rai', 'Carlos Roggero', 'Qing-Jun Zhang', 'Qun Wei', 'Shi Hong Ma', 'Yunyun Zhou', 'John Santoyo', 'Elisabeth D Martinez', 'Guanghua Xiao', 'Ganesh V Raj', 'Ajit Jadhav', 'Anton Simeonov', 'David J Maloney', 'Josep Rizo', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Zhi-Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chem Biol""","""['KDM4B and KDM4A promote endometrial cancer progression by regulating androgen receptor, c-myc, and p27kip1.', 'Therapeutic targeting of histone lysine demethylase KDM4B blocks the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'KDM4B as a target for prostate cancer: structural analysis and selective inhibition by a novel inhibitor.', 'KDM4 histone demethylase inhibitors for anti-cancer agents: a patent review.', 'KDM4/JMJD2 histone demethylases: epigenetic regulators in cancer cells.', 'Histone Demethylase Modulation: Epigenetic Strategy to Combat Cancer Progression.', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Recent Advances with KDM4 Inhibitors and Potential Applications.', 'Natural product myricetin is a pan-KDM4 inhibitor which with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid formulation effectively targets castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer treatment.']"""

Dysregulation of microRNA expression has been reported in several cancers, including prostate cancer (PC). We comprehensively characterized the proteomic footprint of a panel of 12 microRNAs that are potently suppressed in metastatic PC (SiM-miRNAs: miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, miR-135a, miR-143-3p, miR-145-3p, miR-205, miR-221-3p, miR-221-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-24-1-5p, and miR-31) using reverse-phase proteomic arrays. Re-expression of these SiM-miRNAs in PC cells suppressed cell proliferation and targeted key oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle, apoptosis, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, metastasis and the androgen receptor (AR) axis. However, only 12%, at most, of these observed protein expression changes could be explained by predicted direct binding of miRNAs to corresponding mRNAs, suggesting that the majority of these proteomic effects result indirectly. AR and its steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs; SRC-1, -2 and -3) were recurrently affected by these SiM-miRNAs. In agreement, we identified inverse correlations between expression of these SiM-miRNAs and early clinical recurrence, as well as with AR transcriptional activity in human PC tissues. We also identified robust induction of miR-135a by androgen and strong direct binding of AR to the miR-135a locus. As miR-135a potently suppresses AR expression, this results in a negative feedback loop that suppresses AR protein expression in an androgen-dependent manner, while de-repressing AR expression upon androgen deprivation. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of these SiM-miRNAs can result in increased AR axis activity and cell proliferation, thus contributing to disease progression. We further demonstrate that a negative feedback loop involving miR-135a can restore AR expression under androgen-deprivation conditions, thus contributing to the upregulation of AR protein expression in castration-resistant PC. Finally, our unbiased proteomic profiling demonstrates that the majority of actual protein expression changes induced by SiM-miRNAs cannot be explained based on predicted direct interactions.""","""['C Coarfa', 'W Fiskus', 'V K Eedunuri', 'K Rajapakshe', 'C Foley', 'S A Chew', 'S S Shah', 'C Geng', 'J Shou', 'J S Mohamed', ""B W O'Malley"", 'N Mitsiades']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['TCF7 is suppressed by the androgen receptor via microRNA-1-mediated downregulation and is involved in the development of resistance to androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-induced miR-135a acts as a tumor suppressor through downregulating RBAK and MMP11, and mediates resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Identification of miR-30b-3p and miR-30d-5p as direct regulators of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer by complementary functional microRNA library screening.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Interplay between the androgen receptor signaling axis and microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'An unbiased seed-based RNAi selection screen identifies small RNAs that inhibit androgen signaling and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'miR-125b-5p, miR-155-3p, and miR-214-5p and Target E2F2 Gene in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'MicroRNAs in cancer metastasis: biological and therapeutic implications.', 'Downregulated miRNA-491-3p accelerates colorectal cancer growth by increasing uMtCK expression.', 'Hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP combination results in a good biomarker to distinguish between prostate cancer and non-prostate cancer patients.']"""

Beyond VDR, the biologic effects of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), a key protein in vitamin D metabolism. Furthermore, the gene encoding the DBP (GC, group-specific component) has an important role in the vitamin D pathway. Several studies investigated DBP serologic levels and GC polymorphisms in association with cancer risk with controversial results. Thus, we carried out a meta-analysis to investigate these associations.  Methods:   We included 28 independent studies concerning the following tumors: basal cell carcinoma, bladder, breast, colon-rectum, endometrium, liver, esophagus, stomach, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, and kidney. Through random-effect models, we calculated the summary odds ratios (SOR) for serum DBP and the GC polymorphisms rs2282679, rs12512631, rs7041, rs4588, rs17467825, rs1155563, and rs1352844.  Results:   We found a borderline decrease in cancer risk for subjects with high compared with low levels of DBP [SOR, 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-1.00]. Dose-response meta-analysis indicates a nonsignificant decrease risk for an increase of 1,000 nmol/L of DBP (SOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.91-1.01). We found no significant alterations in cancer risk for subjects carrying any of the studied GC polymorphisms compared with wild-type subjects both in the main analysis and in analyses stratified by cancer type and ethnicity.  Conclusions:   We found trends toward significance, suggesting a role of DBP in cancer etiology, which should be confirmed in further studies.

Methods:   Data were collected on 3,675 men with serum prostate specific antigen level (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/ml who underwent initial prostate biopsy with at least 10 cores sampling at time of the biopsy. Two logistic regression models were constructed to predict overall PCa and HGPCa incorporating age, race, family history (FH) of PCa, PSA at diagnosis, PCA3, total prostate volume (TPV), and digital rectal exam (DRE).  Results:   One thousand six hundred twenty (44%) patients had biopsy confirmed PCa with 701 men (19.1%) showing HGPCa. Statistically significant predictors of overall PCa were age (P < 0.0001, OR. 1.51), PSA at diagnosis (P < 0.0001, OR.1.95), PCA3 (P < 0.0001, OR.3.06), TPV (P < 0.0001, OR.0.47), FH (P = 0.003, OR.1.32), and abnormal DRE (P = 0.001, OR. 1.32). While for HGPCa, predictors were age (P < 0.0001, OR.1.77), PSA (P < 0.0001, OR.2.73), PCA3 (P < 0.0001, OR.2.26), TPV (P < 0.0001, OR.0.4), and DRE (P < 0.0001, OR.1.53).

In particular, a HML-2 locus in chromosome 22q11.23 (H22q) is upregulated in many cases. We therefore aimed at delineating the extent and repertoire of HML-2 transcription in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines and to define the transcription pattern and biological effects of H22q.  Methods:   Sanger and high throughput amplicon sequencing was used to define the repertoire of expressed HML-2 in a selected set of samples. qRT-PCR was used to quantify expression of selected proviruses in an extended set of prostate cancer tissues. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were compared bioinformatically using the Transfac database. Expression of H22q was further characterized by siRNA-mediated knockdown, 5' RACE mapping of transcriptional start sites (TSS) and identification of splice sites. Functional effects of H22q knockdown were investigated by viability and apoptosis assays.  Results:   In addition to H22q, a limited number of other proviruses were found expressed by sequencing. Of these, provirus ERVK-5 and to a lesser degree ERVK-15 were frequently upregulated in prostate cancer. In contrast, expression of ERVK-24, predominant in germ cell tumors, was not detectable in prostatic tissues. While HML-2 LTRs contain binding sites for the androgen receptor and cofactors, no consistent differences in transcription factor binding sites were found between expressed and non-expressed proviruses. The H22q locus contains two 5'-LTRs of which the upstream LTR is predominantly used in prostatic cells, with an imprecise TSS. Splicing of H22q transcripts is complex, generating, among others, a transcript with an Np9-like ORF. Knockdown of H22q did not significantly affect proliferation or apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings further underline that HML-2 expression is commonly highly tissue-specific. In prostate cancer, a limited number of loci become activated, especially H22q and ERVK-5. As expressed and non-expressed proviruses do not differ significantly in TFBS, tissue- and tumor-specific expression may be governed primarily by chromatin context. Overexpression of HML-2 H22q is more likely consequence than cause of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Wolfgang Goering', 'Katja Schmitt', 'Melanie Dostert', 'Heiner Schaal', 'René Deenen', 'Jens Mayer', 'Wolfgang A Schulz']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Mechanisms of HERV-K (HML-2) Transcription during Human Mammary Epithelial Cell Transformation.', 'Expression patterns of transcribed human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K(HML-2) loci in human tissues and the need for a HERV Transcriptome Project.', 'HERV-K(HML-2) rec and np9 transcripts not restricted to disease but present in many normal human tissues.', 'Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HML-2) in Health and Disease.', 'HERV-K(HML-2), the Best Preserved Family of HERVs: Endogenization, Expression, and Implications in Health and Disease.', 'Long-range gene regulation in hormone-dependent cancer.', 'Expression of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Group K (HERV-K) HML-2 Correlates with Immune Activation of Macrophages and Type I Interferon Response.', 'Alternative and aberrant splicing of human endogenous retroviruses in cancer.

Single CTCs from each individual display considerable heterogeneity, including expression of AR gene mutations and splicing variants. Retrospective analysis of CTCs from patients progressing under treatment with an AR inhibitor, compared with untreated cases, indicates activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling (P = 0.0064).

Linear models that accounted for the paired study design and False Discovery Rate Q-values were used to evaluate differential CpG methylation. mRNA expression levels of the genes with the most differentially methylated CpG sites were analyzed.  Results:   In total, 2,040 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in PCa versus adjacent benign tissue (Q-value < 0.001), the majority of which were hypermethylated (n = 1,946; 95%).

Mutations in exon 2 of the gene encoding MED12, a key subunit of the regulatory kinase module in Mediator, are extremely frequent in uterine leiomyomas, breast fibroadenomas, and phyllodes tumors. These mutations disrupt kinase module interactions and lead to diminished Mediator-associated kinase activity. MED12 mutations in exon 26, resulting in a substitution of leucine 1224 to phenylalanine (L1224F), have been recurrently observed in prostate cancer.  Methods:   To elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis in prostate cancer, we analyzed global interaction profiles of wild-type and L1224F mutant MED12 with quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Immunoprecipitation and kinase activity assay were used to further assess the interactions between Mediator complex subunits and kinase activity. The presence of L1224F mutation was analyzed in altogether 877 samples representing prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and various tumor types in which somatic MED12 mutations have previously been observed.  Results:   In contrast to N-terminal MED12 mutations observed in uterine leiomyomas, the L1224F mutation compromises neither the interaction of MED12 with kinase module subunits Cyclin C and CDK8/19 nor Mediator-associated CDK activity.

Monitoring of AA exposure uses biomarkers such as aristolactam-DNA adducts, detected by mass spectrometry in the kidney cortex, or the somatic A>T transversion pattern characteristic of exposure to AA, as revealed by previous DNA-sequencing studies using fresh-frozen tumors.  Methods:   Here, we report a low-coverage whole-exome sequencing method (LC-WES) optimized for multisample detection of the AA mutational signature, and demonstrate its utility in 17 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded urothelial tumors obtained from 15 patients with endemic nephropathy, an environmental form of AA nephropathy.  Results:   LC-WES identified the AA signature, alongside signatures of age and APOBEC enzyme activity, in 15 samples sequenced at the average per-base coverage of approximately 10×. Analysis at 3 to 9× coverage revealed the signature in 91% of the positive samples. The exome-wide distribution of the predominant A>T transversions exhibited a stochastic pattern, whereas 83 cancer driver genes were enriched for recurrent nonsynonymous A>T mutations. In two patients, pairs of tumors from different parts of the urinary tract, including the bladder, harbored overlapping mutation patterns, suggesting tumor dissemination via cell seeding.  Conclusions:   LC-WES analysis of archived tumor tissues is a reliable method applicable to investigations of both the exposure to AA and its biologic effects in human carcinomas.  Impact:   By detecting cancers associated with AA exposure in high-risk populations, LC-WES can support future molecular epidemiology studies and provide evidence-base for relevant preventive measures.""","""['Xavier Castells', 'Sandra Karanović', 'Maude Ardin', 'Karla Tomić', 'Evanguelos Xylinas', 'Geoffroy Durand', 'Stephanie Villar', 'Nathalie Forey', 'Florence Le Calvez-Kelm', 'Catherine Voegele', 'Krešimir Karlović', 'Maja Mišić', 'Damir Dittrich', 'Igor Dolgalev', 'James McKay', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Viktoria S Sidorenko', 'Andrea Fernandes', 'Adriana Heguy', 'Kathleen G Dickman', 'Magali Olivier', 'Arthur P Grollman', 'Bojan Jelaković', 'Jiri Zavadil']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Renal cell carcinomas of chronic kidney disease patients harbor the mutational signature of carcinogenic aristolochic acid.', 'Human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues: an untapped specimen for biomonitoring of carcinogen DNA adducts by mass spectrometry.', 'Whole exome sequencing (WES) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).', 'Analysis of TP53 mutation spectra reveals the fingerprint of the potent environmental carcinogen, aristolochic acid.', 'Mutational signature of aristolochic acid: Clue to the recognition of a global disease.', 'High Level of Aristolochic Acid Detected With a Unique Genomic Landscape Predicts Early UTUC Onset After Renal Transplantation in Taiwan.', 'Molecular profiles and urinary biomarkers of upper tract urothelial carcinomas associated with aristolochic acid exposure.', 'Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinomas: Current Knowledge and Future Directions.', 'Aristolochic acid-associated urinary tract cancers: an updated meta-analysis of risk and oncologic outcomes after surgery and systematic review of molecular alterations observed in human studies.', 'Current Knowledge on Genomic Profiling of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.']"""

Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that there may be be an association between statin use and decreased risk of prostate cancer progression. Both inherited and somatic mutations of the mitochondrial genome are linked to prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine if mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) background and hence mitochondrial biochemistry can modulate the efficiency of statin as an anti-prostate cancer agent.  Methods:   Cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines were constructed that contained a prostate cancer nucleus and either wild type or mutant mtDNA derived from a prostate cancer patient with the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene mutation T6124C (Met74Thr). Multiple clones for each genotype were tested. After treating both wild type and mutant cells with increasing concentrations of simvastatin for 72 hr, cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed.  Results:   Simvastatin inhibited both wild type and mutant cell proliferation. However, cells with the T6124C mtDNA mutation were more resistant to drug treatment than the wild type cells. In addition, analysis of caspase 3 assays and multiple proteins involved in cellular apoptosis demonstrated that mutant cells were more resistant to simvastatin treatment-induced apoptosis than wild type control cells.  Conclusions:   Simvastatin treatment induced apoptosis in human cybrid prostate cancer cells. The response to drug treatments was different depending on mitochondrial genotype.

Data on ERG status and PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15 deletions were available from earlier studies. AZGP1 expression was strong in benign prostatic glands but absent in 38.0% of 8,510 interpretable prostate cancers. Reduced AZGP1 expression was associated with TPMRSS2:ERG fusions, both by FISH and immunohistochemical analysis (p < 0.0001 each). For example, AZGP1 was absent in 54.6% of 2,029 ERG IHC positive but in only 28.1% of 2,398 ERG negative cancers. Irrespective of the ERG status, reduced AZGP1 expression was tightly linked to high Gleason score, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal status and early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). Reduced AZGP1 expression was also strongly associated with PTEN deletions. AZGP1 immunostaining was lacking in 62.7% of 842 PTEN deleted but in only 37.3% of PTEN non-deleted cancers but retained strong prognostic influence in both subgroups (p < 0.0001 each). The prognostic role of AZGP1 expression was also independent of Gleason score, pT stage, pN stage, surgical margin status and preoperative PSA, irrespective of whether preoperative or postoperative variables were used for modeling.

We have investigated whether BTK is a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer. We find that BTK is expressed in prostate cells, with the alternate BTK-C isoform predominantly expressed in prostate cancer cells and tumors. This isoform is transcribed from an alternative promoter and results in a protein with an amino-terminal extension. Prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tumors express more BTK-C transcript than the malignant NAMALWA B-cell line or human lymphomas. BTK protein expression is also observed in tumor tissue from prostate cancer patients. Down regulation of this protein with RNAi or inhibition with BTK-specific inhibitors, Ibrutinib, AVL-292 or CGI-1746 decrease cell survival and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Microarray results show that inhibiting BTK under these conditions increases expression of apoptosis related genes, while overexpression of BTK-C is associated with elevated expression of genes with functions related to cell adhesion, cytoskeletal structure and the extracellular matrix. These results are consistent with studies that show that BTK signaling is important for adhesion and migration of B cells and suggest that BTK-C may confer similar properties to prostate cancer cells. Since BTK-C is a survival factor for these cells, it represents both a potential biomarker and novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Leila Kokabee', 'Xianhui Wang', 'Christopher J Sevinsky', 'Wei Lin Winnie Wang', 'Lindsay Cheu', 'Sridar V Chittur', 'Morteza Karimipoor', 'Martin Tenniswood', 'Douglas S Conklin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""[""Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Prevent Therapeutic Escape in Breast Cancer Cells."", ""Preclinical investigation of ibrutinib, a Bruton's kinase tyrosine (Btk) inhibitor, in suppressing glioma tumorigenesis and stem cell phenotypes."", ""The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib exerts immunomodulatory effects through regulation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages."", 'Bruton Kinase Inhibitors in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.', ""Strategies to overcome resistance mutations of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib."", 'Ibrutinib Inhibits BTK Signaling in Tumor-Infiltrated B Cells and Amplifies Antitumor Immunity by PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', ""Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (BTKIs): Review of Preclinical Studies and Evaluation of Clinical Trials."", 'BTK Isoforms p80 and p65 Are Expressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and Involved in Tumor Progression.', ""Comparison of Intermolecular Interactions of Irreversible and Reversible Inhibitors with Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase via Molecular Dynamics Simulations."", 'BTK, the new kid on the (oncology) block?']"""

Among 34,727 patients, those who died of their prostate cancer had more hospice and outpatient use, less inpatient and intensive care unit use, and lower overall costs. Efforts to shift care toward the outpatient setting might provide more efficient and judicious care for patients during the end of life.  Background:   Prostate cancer poses a significant financial burden in the United States. However, most men with prostate cancer will die from noncancer causes. Concerns about increased resource utilization at the end of life have not been appropriately examined in this context.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data of men who were diagnosed with and died of, as opposed to with, prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007. Within these 2 populations, we compared changes in the use of medical interventions, hospice, and overall health care costs to Medicare in the last year of life.  Results:   Among 34,727 patients, those who died of prostate cancer had lower costs ($43,572 vs. $45,830; P < .001), largely because of lower mean inpatient costs ($20,769 vs. $29,851) and fewer hospitalizations (1.8 vs. 2.1), inpatient days (12.2 vs. 15.7), intensive care unit (ICU) days (1.4 vs. 3.4), and skilled nursing facility days (11.7 vs. 14.7; P < .001 for all). Outpatient and hospice costs were significantly greater among patients who died of prostate cancer, as was use of chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy. Patients who died of prostate cancer had approximately 12% lower costs than patients who died from other causes in adjusted analyses (fold-change, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.92). The single strongest predictor of increased costs at the end of life was receipt of multiple invasive procedures (fold increase in costs, 2.39; 95% CI, 2.22-2.58).  Conclusion:   Patients who died of prostate cancer rather than from other causes had more hospice and outpatient use, less inpatient and ICU use, and lower overall costs.

We have demonstrated that abiraterone, a selective androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, is a safe and active therapeutic option in a subgroup of 47 very elderly adults (aged > 80 years) enrolled in the Italian named patient program, with a tolerability profile and clinical outcomes comparable to those of younger population.  Background:   Prostate cancer mainly affects elderly men, who are often frail and whose reduced physiological reserves and multiple comorbidities increase the risk of side effects. The availability of new drugs has improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) but has increased the number of very elderly CRPC patients receiving anticancer drugs, raising questions about their efficacy and safety in this population.  Patients and methods:   We assessed the tolerability of abiraterone (AA) in a cohort of very elderly adults with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) enrolled in the Italian AA named patient program and analyzed their clinical outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 47 mCRPC patients aged > 80 years who had received AA after docetaxel. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Safety and clinical outcomes were also analyzed by age group (< 80 and > 80 years). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the differences in PFS and OS between the groups according to the stratification variables.  Results:   In very elderly men, the prostate-specific antigen response rate was 48.9%, and the median PFS and OS were 8 and 18 months, respectively. The differences in toxicities between the older and younger age groups were not major. The limitation of the present study was mainly its retrospective nature.

Aim:   The aim of this study was to identify practice, responsibility attitudes, knowledge, and barriers of Dutch radiation oncologists regarding sexual counseling.  Methods:   A cross-sectional survey was performed using a 28-item questionnaire sent to all members of the Dutch Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology.  Main outcome measures:   Self-reported practice, knowledge, barriers, need for training and responsibility attitudes in regard to demographic characteristics.  Results:   Of the surveyed sample, 54.6% of the radiation oncologists completed the instrument (n = 119). Frequency of discussing sexual function was fluctuating, depending on the type of tumor. The majority of the responding radiation oncologists (75%) agreed that discussing sexual function is their responsibility, about one-third (33.6%) pointed at the involved specialist (surgeon, urologist, gynecologist, or oncologist), a fifth also considered the general practitioner responsible (21%). Additional training about discussing sexuality was required according to 44.4%, the majority agreed that sexual counseling should be a regular component of radiation oncology residency (n = 110, 94%). Barriers most mentioned included patient is too ill (36.2%), no angle or reason for asking (32.4%), advanced age of the patient (27%) and culture/religion (26.1%). For prostate cancer patients, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor information was supplied regularly (49.2%) and often (40.7%).  Conclusions:   Radiation oncologists generally perform sexual counseling in case of pelvic radiation therapy, but not consistently in case of gastrointestinal, breast, and other cancers. The majority of radiation oncologists considered counseling on sexual functioning as a part of their job, some also pointed at the referring specialist or general practitioner. The findings suggest that awareness about sexual dysfunction is present among radiation oncologists, but responsibility for active counseling is uncertain.

Multi-state models generalize them by jointly considering different types of events and their interrelations, whereas frailty models incorporate random effects to account for unobserved risk factors, possibly shared by clusters of subjects. The integration of multi-state and frailty methodology is an interesting way to control for unobserved heterogeneity in the presence of complex event history structures and is particularly appealing for multicenter clinical trials. We propose the incorporation of correlated frailties in the transition-specific hazard function, thanks to a nested hierarchy. We studied a semiparametric estimation approach based on maximum integrated partial likelihood. We show in a simulation study that the nested frailty multi-state model improves the estimation of the effect of covariates, as well as the coverage probability of their confidence intervals.

Methods:   PTEN gene status in CTCs was evaluated on an enrichment-free platform (Epic Sciences) by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). PTEN status in archival and fresh tumour tissue was evaluated by FISH and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Peripheral blood was collected from 76 patients.

Apigenin, a naturally occurring plant flavone, exhibits anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities by inhibiting NF-κB pathway, through a mechanism not fully understood. We found that apigenin feeding in microgram doses (bioavailable in humans) inhibited prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice by interfering with NF-κB signaling. Apigenin feeding to TRAMP mice (20 and 50 μg/mouse/day, 6 days/week for 20 weeks) exhibited significant decrease in tumor volumes of the prostate and completely abolished metastasis, which correlated with inhibition of NF-κB activation and binding to the DNA. Apigenin intake blocked phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by inhibiting IKK activation, which in turn led to suppression of NF-κB activation. The expression of NF-κB-regulated gene products involved in proliferation (cyclin D1, and COX-2), anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) were also downregulated after apigenin feeding. These events correlated with the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, as evident by increased cleaved caspase-3 labeling index in the dorsolateral prostate. Our results provide convincing evidence that apigenin inhibits IKK activation and restores the expression of IκBα, preventing it's phosphorylation in a fashion similar to that elicited by IKK and proteasomal inhibitors through suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway.""","""['Sanjeev Shukla', 'Eswar Shankar', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Gregory T MacLennan', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Suppression of constitutive and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells: correlation with down-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.', 'Fisetin, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 6, down-regulates nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated cell proliferation, antiapoptotic and metastatic gene products through the suppression of TAK-1 and receptor-interacting protein-regulated IkappaBalpha kinase activation.', 'N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide inhibits invasion, suppresses osteoclastogenesis, and potentiates apoptosis through down-regulation of I(kappa)B(alpha) kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated gene products.', 'Pro-apoptotic effects of lipid oxidation products: HNE at the crossroads of NF-κB pathway and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2.', 'The IKK/NF-kappaB activation pathway-a target for prevention and treatment of cancer.', 'Carica Papaya Reduces High Fat Diet and Streptozotocin-Induced Development of Inflammation in Adipocyte via IL-1β/IL-6/TNF-α Mediated Signaling Mechanisms in Type-2 Diabetic Rats.', 'An Update on the Therapeutic Anticancer Potential of Ocimum sanctum L.: ""Elixir of Life"".', 'Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Dietary Flavones: Tapping into Nature to Control Chronic Inflammation in Obesity and Cancer.', 'Natural Products as Anticancer Agents: Current Status and Future Perspectives.', 'Recent updates on anticancer mechanisms of polyphenols.']"""

For focal treatment, optimal needle guidance and placement is warranted. This can be achieved under MR guidance. However, MR-guided needle placement is currently not possible due to space restrictions in the closed MR bore. To overcome this problem, a MR-compatible, single-divergent needle-implant robotic device is under development at the University Medical Centre, Utrecht: placed between the legs of the patient inside the MR bore, this robot will tap the needle in a divergent pattern from a single rotation point into the tissue. This rotation point is just beneath the perineal skin to have access to the focal prostate tumor lesion. Currently, there is no treatment planning system commercially available which allows optimization of the dose distribution with such needle arrangement. The aim of this work is to develop an automatic inverse dose planning optimization tool for focal HDR prostate brachytherapy with needle insertions in a divergent configuration. A complete optimizer workflow is proposed which includes the determination of (1) the position of the center of rotation, (2) the needle angulations and (3) the dwell times. Unlike most currently used optimizers, no prior selection or adjustment of input parameters such as minimum or maximum dose or weight coefficients for treatment region and organs at risk is required. To test this optimizer, a planning study was performed on ten patients (treatment volumes ranged from 8.5 cm(3)to 23.3 cm(3)) by using 2-14 needle insertions. The total computation time of the optimizer workflow was below 20 min and a clinically acceptable plan was reached on average using only four needle insertions.""","""['M Borot de Battisti', 'M Maenhout', 'B Denis de Senneville', 'G Hautvast', 'D Binnekamp', 'J J W Lagendijk', 'M van Vulpen', 'M A Moerland']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Adaptive planning strategy for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy—a simulation study on needle positioning errors.', 'A novel adaptive needle insertion sequencing for robotic, single needle MR-guided high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative optimization of needle placement and dwell times for conformal prostate brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Focal Salvage Treatment of Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review of Current Strategies and Future Perspectives.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: the technical challenges.']"""

This work aimed to optimize the cocktail composition for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Materials and methods:   The study was carried out on six patients with mCRPC, with a total of 26 analyzed lesions. The patients were injected with F-NaF and F-FDG at separate time points. Dynamic PET/CT imaging recorded the uptake time course for both the tracers into osseous metastases. F-NaF and F-FDG uptakes were decoupled by kinetic analysis, which enabled calculation of F-NaF and F-FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) images. Peak, mean, and total SUVs were evaluated for both tracers and all visible lesions. The F-NaF/F-FDG cocktail was optimized under the assumption that the contribution of both tracers to image formation is equal. SUV images from PET/CT imaging with a combination of F-NaF and F-FDG were generated for cocktail compositions with an F-NaF : F-FDG ratio varying from 1 : 8 to 1 : 2.  Results:   The F-NaF peak and mean SUVs were on average four to five times higher than the F-FDG peak and mean SUVs, with an interlesion coefficient of variations of 20%. The total SUV for F-NaF was on average seven times higher than that for F-FDG. When the F-NaF : F-FDG ratio changed from 1 : 8 to 1 : 2, the typical SUV on the generated PET images increased by 50%, whereas the change in the uptake visual pattern was hardly noticeable.  Conclusion:   F-NaF and F-FDG in the cocktail contribute equally to image formation when the F-NaF : F-FDG ratio is 1 : 5. Therefore, we propose this ratio as the optimal cocktail composition for mCRPC patients.

Although the new generation of anti-androgens such as enzalutamide effectively inhibits AR activity, accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence indicates that AR-v7 remains constitutively active in driving CRPC progression. However, molecular mechanisms which control AR-v7 protein expression remain unclear. We apply multiple prostate cancer cell models to demonstrate that enzalutamide induces differential activation of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) and Akt kinase depending on the gene context of cancer cells. The balance between PP-1 and Akt activation governs AR phosphorylation status and activation of the Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase. Mdm2 recognizes phosphorylated serine 213 of AR-v7, and induces AR-v7 ubiquitination and protein degradation.

Tumors usually develop resistance (castration-resistant PCa [CRPC]), but remain androgen receptor (AR) dependent. Numerous mechanisms for AR-dependent resistance have been identified including expression of constitutively active AR splice variants lacking the hormone-binding domain. Recent clinical studies show that expression of the best-characterized AR variant, AR-V7, correlates with resistance to ADT and poor outcome. Whether AR-V7 is simply a constitutively active substitute for AR or has novel gene targets that cause unique downstream changes is unresolved. Several studies have shown that AR activation alters cell metabolism. Using LNCaP cells with inducible expression of AR-V7 as a model system, we found that AR-V7 stimulated growth, migration, and glycolysis measured by ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) similar to AR. However, further analyses using metabolomics and metabolic flux assays revealed several differences. Whereas AR increased citrate levels, AR-V7 reduced citrate mirroring metabolic shifts observed in CRPC patients. Flux analyses indicate that the low citrate is a result of enhanced utilization rather than a failure to synthesize citrate. Moreover, flux assays suggested that compared to AR, AR-V7 exhibits increased dependence on glutaminolysis and reductive carboxylation to produce some of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) metabolites.

Further study proved that LG308 induced mitotic phase arrest and inhibited G2/M progression significantly in LNCaP and PC-3M cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and these were associated with the upregulation of cyclin B1 and mitotic marker MPM-2 and the dephosphorylation of cdc2.

For therapeutic management it is important, that TGCT are divided into several histological subtypes. MED15 is part of the multiprotein Mediator complex which presents an integrative hub for transcriptional regulation and is known to be deregulated in several malignancies, such as prostate cancer and bladder cancer role, whereas the role of the Mediator complex in TGCT has not been investigated so far. Aim of the study was to investigate the implication of MED15 in TGCT development and its stratification into histological subtypes.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) against Mediator complex subunit MED15 was conducted on a TGCT cohort containing tumor-free testis (n = 35), intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (IGCNU, n = 14), seminomas (SEM, n = 107) and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT, n = 42), further subdivided into embryonic carcinomas (EC, n = 30), yolk sac tumors (YST, n = 5), chorionic carcinomas (CC, n = 5) and teratomas (TER, n = 2). Quantification of MED15 protein expression was performed through IHC followed by semi-quantitative image analysis using the Definiens software.  Results:   In tumor-free seminiferous tubules, MED15 protein expression was absent or only low expressed in spermatogonia. Interestingly, the precursor lesions IGCNU exhibited heterogeneous but partly very strong MED15 expression. SEM weakly express the Mediator complex subunit MED15, whereas NSGCT and especially EC show significantly enhanced expression compared to tumor-free testis.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, MED15 is differentially expressed in tumor-free testis and TGCT. While MED15 is absent or low in tumor-free testis and SEM, NSGCT highly express MED15, hinting at the diagnostic potential of this marker to distinguish between SEM and NSGCT. Further, the precursor lesion IGCNU showed increased nuclear MED15 expression in the preinvasive precursor cells, which may provide diagnostic value to distinguish between benign and pre-malignant testicular specimen, and may indicate a role for MED15 in carcinogenesis in TGCT.""","""['Niklas Klümper#', 'Isabella Syring#', 'Anne Offermann', 'David Adler', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Stefan C Müller', 'Jörg Ellinger', 'Arne Strauß', 'Heinz Joachim Radzun', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Johannes Brägelmann', 'Sven Perner#', 'Felix Bremmer#']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Diagn Pathol""","""['Germ cell tumors of the gonads: a selective review emphasizing problems in differential diagnosis, newly appreciated, and controversial issues.', 'Diagnostic value of immunohistochemistry and FISH for chromosome 12p in type Ⅱ testicular germ cell tumors.', 'Protein overexpression and gene amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor in adult testicular germ cell tumors: potential role in tumor progression.', 'p53: a good diagnostic marker for intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified.', 'Recent advances in the biology of germ cell tumors: implications for the diagnosis and treatment.', 'Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Tissue Biomarker Analysis: A Comparison of Human Protein Atlas and Individual Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Component Immunohistochemistry.', 'Downstream Neighbor of SON (DONSON) Expression Is Enhanced in Phenotypically Aggressive Prostate Cancers.', 'Downstream neighbor of SON (DONSON) is associated with unfavorable survival across diverse cancers with oncogenic properties in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Increased mediator complex subunit 15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Mediator Complex Subunit MED1 Protein Expression Is Decreased during Bladder Cancer Progression.']"""

Unfortunately, radical prostatectomy is associated with urinary incontinence and has a significant negative impact on quality of life. Pelvic floor exercises are the most common non-invasive management strategy for urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy; however, studies provide inconsistent findings regarding their efficacy. One potential reason for sub-optimal efficacy of these interventions is the under-utilization of regional muscles that normally co-activate with the pelvic floor, such as the transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, and the diaphragm. Two novel approaches to improve urinary continence recovery are 'Pfilates' and 'Hypopressives' that combine traditional pelvic floor exercises with the activation of additional supportive muscles. Our study will compare an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program that includes Pfilates and Hypopressives, to a conventional pelvic floor exercises regimen for the treatment of post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence.  Methods/design:   This is a pilot, randomized controlled trial of advanced pelvic floor muscle training versus conventional pelvic floor exercises for men with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. Eighty-eight men who will be undergoing radical prostatectomy at hospitals in Toronto, Canada will be recruited. Eligible participants must not have undergone androgen deprivation therapy and/or radiation therapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive 26 weeks of the advanced or conventional pelvic floor exercise programs. Each program will be progressive and have comparable exercise volume. The primary outcomes are related to feasibility for a large, adequately powered randomized controlled trial to determine efficacy for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Feasibility will be assessed via recruitment success, participant retention, outcome capture, intervention adherence, and prevalence of adverse events. Secondary outcomes of intervention efficacy include measures of pelvic floor strength, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and quality of life. Secondary outcome measures will be collected prior to surgery (baseline), and at 2, 6, 12, 26-weeks post-operatively.  Discussion:   Pfilates and Hypopressives are novel approaches to optimizing urinary function after radical prostatectomy.

Up to now there is no clear evidence to suggest that concomitant PCa is a predictor of outcome in these patients. Aim of this study was to assess incidence and clinicopathologic characteristics of concomitant PCa in RCPx specimen and correlate it to survival parameters from a single-centre material over two decades.  Methods:   All men who had undergone RCPx for BCa at our institution between 1994 and 2013 were included in this study. Clinicopathologic parameters for BCa and PCa were evaluated and correlated with outcome parameters. Survival analysis was performed for the subgroup of nonmetastatic organ-confined BCa to evaluate the role of concomitant Gleason Score (GS) ≥7 PCa.  Results:   Of 945 men who had undergone RCPx for BCa, concomitant PCa was present in 237 patients (25.1 %). There was a significant increase in PCa incidence from 18.9 to 32.3 % between 1994 and 2013 (p = 0.009). Concomitant PCa represented a more aggressive phenotype at the end of the study (p = 0.037). In nonmetastatic organ-confined BCa, concomitant GS ≥7 PCa (HR 3.09; p = 0.0001) and age > 68 (HR 1.80; p = 0.0004) were independent negative predictors for overall survival.  Conclusions:   Concomitant PCa in RCPx specimen of BCa patients is a common finding.

We also observed a dose-dependent inhibition of the Gli-reporter activity in Shh Light II and TRAMP-C2QGli cells treated with SLE. In addition, SLE can inhibit Gli/Hh signaling by blocking Gli1 and Ptched1 gene expression in the presence of a Gli/Hh signaling agonist (SAG). A diet supplemented with S. frutescens suppressed the formation of poorly differentiated carcinoma in prostates of TRAMP mice. Finally, we found Sutherlandioside D was the most potent compound in the crude extract that could suppress Gli-reporter in Shh Light II cells.

Significantly, lower IL-6 immunoreactivity was observed in normal epithelial cells (p=0.000) and basal cells (p=0.000) in the samples of prostate adenocarcinoma in comparison to the samples with BPH, PIN and prostatitis. There was no significant difference in IL-6 expression in malignant and premalignant cells (p=0.814) as well as in stromal cells among the four diagnoses (p=0.22). IL-6 was expressed in normal epithelial cells, premalignant epithelial cells and malignant epithelial cells as well as in stromal cells. However, in our research IL-6 was of limited utility as a single marker for differential diagnosis of the prostate diseases in small foci needle biopsy by pathologist visual scoring. The standardization of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining protocol for IL-6 is required to determine IL-6 expression in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the IHC results.""","""['Nevenka Miličević', 'Milanka Mrčela', 'Josip Galić', 'Ksenija Marjanović']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Immunohistochemical localization of interleukin-6 and its receptor in benign, premalignant and malignant prostate tissue.', 'The diagnostic utility of novel immunohistochemical marker ERG in the workup of prostate biopsies with ""atypical glands suspicious for cancer"".', 'The morphogenesis of cancer of the prostate (immunohistochemical research).', 'Minimal criteria for the diagnosis of prostate cancer on needle biopsy.', 'Benign mimickers of the prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   A urine sample was prospectively obtained in 1015 patients undergoing prostate biopsies to determine the PCA3 score. The predictive value of PCA3 was explored using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (ROC), multivariable logistic regression analysis and decision curve analysis.  Results:   The median PCA3 score was significantly higher in patients with positive biopsies. The PCA3 score AUC was 0.76 (0.73-0.79), significantly higher than that of PSA (0.55; 0.51-0.58). At the cut-off of 35, sensitivity was 68 %, specificity 71 %, positive and negative predictive values 67 % and 71 %, and accuracy 69 %. Using multivariate analysis, PCA3 score appeared as an independent predictor of biopsy outcome and its addition to a base model including usual clinico-biological parameters resulted in a significant increase in predictive accuracy. At the cut-off of 20, about 1/2 of the eventual useless biopsies would have been avoided while ignoring 7 % of cancers with Gleason score ≥ 7. PCA3 score did not correlate to Gleason score but correlated to tumor volume (proportion of invaded cores).  Conclusion:   Urinary PCA3 is a useful test with high diagnostic performance for early prostate cancer diagnosis. Its correlation with cancer aggressiveness seems rather represented by a link to prostate volume than Gleason score.""","""['V Vlaeminck-Guillem', 'M Devonec', 'D Champetier', 'M Decaussi-Petrucci', 'P Paparel', 'P Perrin', 'A Ruffion']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Editorial comment to: Urinary PCA3 to predict prostate cancer in a cohort of 1015 patients.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'PCA3 molecular urine test as a predictor of repeat prostate biopsy outcome in men with previous negative biopsies: a prospective multicenter clinical study.', 'PCA3: a molecular urine assay for predicting prostate biopsy outcome.', 'Value of urinary PCA3 test for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Effect of upregulation of DD3 on early detection and prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Diagnosis accuracy of PCA3 level in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic significance of urinary long non-coding PCA3 RNA in prostate cancer.']"""

Here we show that the phosphorylation activation at Ser536 of RelA/p65 protein, a main subunit in the NF-κB family, may play a tumor-suppressive role. In normal colon mucosa, RelA/p65 phosphorylation at Ser536 was increasingly increased with the maturation and apoptotic shedding of epithelial cells, but the phosphorylation at Ser536 was decreased in colon cancer. In colon (HCT116 p53 wt and p53 -/-), breast (MCF7), and prostate (LNCaP and DU145) cancer cells, a phosphomimetic mutation of RelA/p65 at Ser536 (named p65/S536D) triggered dramatic apoptosis through affecting expression of a wide range of cell death/survival genes, such as Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bcl-2 and survivin. In HCT116 cells, p65/S536D mutant upregulated Fas, insulted mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered cleavage and activation of caspase-3, 7, 8 and 9. A FasL neutralizing antibody (NOK1) prevented cell death induced by the p65/S536D. A pan inhibitor of caspases, Z-VAD-FMK (20 μM), blocked caspase-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization. This p65/S536D also triggered senescence in HCT116 cells through a p16-dependent pathway, but not in MFC7 due to lack of p16. Intratumoral delivery of the p65/S536D effectively suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Together our data suggest that the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 at Ser536 may confer it a tumor-suppressive role by inducing apoptosis and senescence, highlighting the importance of discriminating the function and active status of individual active sites in RelA/p65 when NF-κB inhibitors are considered for targeted therapy of cancer.""","""['Yiwen Bu', 'Xiaoning Li', 'Yingchun He', 'Chenfei Huang', 'Yi Shen', 'Yu Cao', 'Dan Huang', 'Chuan Cai', 'Yuhong Wang', 'Ziqi Wang', 'Duan-Fang Liao', 'Deliang Cao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Targeting NF-κB RelA/p65 phosphorylation overcomes RITA resistance.', 'Citrobacter rodentium-induced NF-kappaB activation in hyperproliferating colonic epithelia: role of p65 (Ser536) phosphorylation.', 'The role of p65 NF-kappaB/RelA in pancreatitis-induced Kupffer cell apoptosis.', 'STC1 promotes cell apoptosis via NF-κB phospho-P65 Ser536 in cervical cancer cells.', 'Caspase-mediated p65 cleavage promotes TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'GZ17-6.02 kills prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'The positive regulatory loop of TCF4N/p65 promotes glioblastoma tumourigenesis and chemosensitivity.', 'Construction and validation of a prognostic risk model for breast cancer based on protein expression.', 'Hypoxia-Mediated Complement 1q Binding Protein Regulates Metastasis and Chemoresistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Modulates the PKC-NF-κB-VCAM-1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Protective Effects of Cinnamaldehyde against Mesenteric Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Lung and Liver Injuries in Rats.']"""

Comparison with publicly available datasets, however, suggested that prostate CAFs may be alternatively characterized by IL6 and TGFβ-related signatures, indicating that either signal, depending on the context, may concur to fibroblast activation. Our analyses also highlighted novel pathways potentially relevant for induction of a reactive stroma.

The platform consists of microtissues from prostate cancer cells, combined with CAFs in extracellular matrix that allows biochemical perturbation. Tracking of fibroblast dynamics revealed that CAFs guided the way for tumor cells to invade and increased the growth and invasiveness of tumor organoids. We utilized the platform to determine the efficacy of inhibitors in prostate cancer and the associated tumor microenvironment as a functional unit. Interestingly, certain inhibitors selectively disrupted tumor-CAF interactions, e.g. focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors specifically blocked tumor growth and invasion concurrently with fibroblast spreading and motility.

ALAN-induced perturbation of the CTS melatonin synchronizer signal is communicated maternally at the very onset of life and after birth via breast or artificial formula feedings. Nighttime use of personal computers, mobile phones, electronic tablets, televisions, and the like--now epidemic in adolescents and adults and highly prevalent in pre-school and school-aged children--is a new source of ALAN. However, ALAN exposure occurs concomitantly with almost complete absence of daytime sunlight, whose blue-violet (446-484 nm λ) spectrum synchronizes the CTS and whose UV-B (290-315 nm λ) spectrum stimulates vitamin D synthesis. Under natural conditions and clear skies, day/night and annual cycles of UV-B irradiation drive corresponding periodicities in vitamin D synthesis and numerous bioprocesses regulated by active metabolites augment and strengthen the biological time structure. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are widespread in children and adults in developed and developing countries as a consequence of inadequate sunlight exposure. Past epidemiologic studies have focused either on exposure to too little daytime UV-B or too much ALAN, respectively, on vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency or melatonin suppression in relation to risk of cancer and other, e.g., psychiatric, hypertensive, cardiac, and vascular, so-called, diseases of civilization.

Previously, it was demonstrated that mTOR activates IKK/NF-κB signaling by promoting IκB kinase (IKK) activity downstream of Akt in conditions deficient of PTEN. In this study, the mechanistic role of the tumor-suppressor TSC2 was investigated in the regulation of IKK/NF-κB activity in PTEN-null prostate cancer and in TSC2-mutated tumor cells. The results demonstrate that TSC2 inhibits IKK/NF-κB activity downstream of Akt and upstream of mTORC1 in a PTEN-deficient environment.

Methods:   Patients were non-randomly allocated to one of the five treatment strategies: hormone therapy, active surveillance, radiation, operation, or watchful waiting.  Results:   A total of 3169 patients were included by 259 participating sites; 2957 patients had at least one follow-up visit. 54.8 % of tumors at baseline were staged as T1c, 38 % as T2a-T2c, and 7.1 % as T1a or T1b (missing: 0.2 %). 38.9, 32.6 and 26.6 % of patients were classified as low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk according to d'Amico, respectively (missing: 1.8 %). 56.6 % of patients underwent prostatectomy as primary therapy, 16.4 % received radiation, 6.9 % HT, 15.8 and 4.3 % decided for AS or WW. Mean follow-up was 28.4 months. Progression rates were between 8.6 % (RT) and 33.1 % (AS).  Conclusion:   Whereas RP remains the main treatment option of localized PCa, active surveillance appears to become an accepted and selectively employed treatment option. Careful selection of patients is documented by the highest proportion of patients with low risk (82.5 %), PSA density <0.2 ng/ml/ml (77.5 %), T1 staging (83.6 %), Gleason score ≤6 (92.5 %), ≤2 positive biopsies (79.4 %), and lowest mean PSA (5.8 ng/ml) in the AS group.

Collecting PROs during point-of-care assessments and integrating them into the clinical setting, however, remains challenging. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the reliability, usability, and acceptability of point-of-care electronic PRO assessments implemented in a prostate cancer clinic.  Methods:   Fifty subjects completed paper-pencil and computerized formats of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), a validated, condition-specific QOL instrument, at separate times before treatment. Parallel-forms reliability was evaluated by comparing mean scores, variations in response distribution, and correlations between administration formats. Correlation coefficients of at least 0.70 were used for reliability testing. Differences between administration forms, indicating potential bias, were compared using the signed-rank test. A 6-item acceptability scale was also used to evaluate patient acceptability and satisfaction with the electronic format.  Results:   Mean scores and standard deviations were similar between the paper-pencil and electronic forms across all EPIC instrument domains, and no assessment bias was found. Each EPIC domain demonstrated a high reliability between administration formats (correlation coefficients: 0.70-0.98). The majority (>90 %) of respondents found that the computerized QOL format was user friendly and simple to use.

Purpose:   To validate SMA-raloxifene for the management of CRPC using a mouse xenograft model.  Methods:   The internalisation and retention of micellar and free raloxifene in vitro were measured by HPLC. A PC3-CRPC xenograft model was used to compare the biodistribution of both raloxifene formulations, as well as their effect on tumour progression where mice received free raloxifene (1 or 5 mg/kg, i.v.) or SMA-raloxifene (1 mg/kg, i.v.) weekly for 4 weeks.  Results:   SMA-raloxifene exhibited 75% higher intracellular content compared to free drug after 48 h in PC3 cells. Biodistribution of raloxifene was 69% higher in tumours following SMA-raloxifene compared with free raloxifene. Weekly administration of 1 mg/kg free raloxifene reduced tumour progression by 20% after 4 weeks, whereas 1 mg/kg SMA-raloxifene and 5 mg/kg free raloxifene reduced progression by 40%.

A semi-quantitative analysis method that evaluates bone scan images has been eagerly anticipated. BONENAVI is software that enables automatic assessment of bone scan index (BSI). BSI is useful for stratifying cancer patients and monitoring their therapeutic response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the BONENAVI reading in determining BSI and hot spots at different time intervals after radioisotope injection.  Methods:   We evaluated 32 patients, including 22 males and 10 females. Ten patients had breast cancer, 20 patients had prostate cancer, and 2 had malignant pheochromocytoma. Patients were injected with 740 MBq of (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate and bone scintigraphy was performed at 2, 4, and 6 h after injection on each patient. The BSI and the number of hot spots were obtained from BONENAVI software. Bone scan images were also visually assessed to exclude false positives due to artifacts. Analyses were performed in all lesions, selected true lesions, segment based and cancer type based. Non-parametric statistical analyses for pairwise multiple group comparison were performed using Friedman test followed with post hoc analysis.  Results:   The BSIs and the number of hot spots were significantly increased with time, with significant differences between each of time points (P < 0.001). Analysis of regional BSI (rBSI) and hot spot number changes of selected 15 true lesions also showed similar increase (P < 0.001). In general, the pelvic segment was the most prone to rBSI changes and the chest segment was the most prone to hot spot number changes. Visual assessment showed that BONENAVI diagnosed some typical artifacts as metastases (hot spots).  Conclusion:   BONENAVI reading of BSIs and hot spot numbers was highly affected by acquisition time. In serial or follow-up examinations (in particular, for monitoring therapeutic efficacy), acquisition time should be fixed for each patient. Cautious interpretation should be made on segments with high physiological uptake. BONENAVI reading was prone to misinterpretation of artifacts. Visual assessment is necessary to rule out this possibility.""","""['Rini Shintawati', 'Arifudin Achmad', 'Tetsuya Higuchi', 'Hirotaka Shimada', 'Hiromi Hirasawa', 'Yukiko Arisaka', 'Ayako Takahashi', 'Takahito Nakajima', 'Yoshito Tsushima']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Assessment of bone scans in advanced prostate carcinoma using fully automated and semi-automated bone scan index methods.', 'Evaluation of a revised version of computer-assisted diagnosis system, BONENAVI version 2.1.7, for bone scintigraphy in cancer patients.', 'Comparison of diagnostic precision for bone metastasis of primary breast cancer between BONENAVI version 1 and BONENAVI version 2.', 'Bone scan index: A new biomarker of bone metastasis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Scoring systems of quantitative bone scanning in prostate cancer: historical overview, current status and future perspectives.', 'Application of SPECT and PET / CT with computer-aided diagnosis in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Artificial intelligence for nuclear medicine in oncology.', 'Clinical Use of Quantitative Analysis of Bone Scintigraphy to Assess the Involvement of Arthritis Diseases in Patients with Joint Symptoms.', 'Analysis of Bone Scans in Various Tumor Entities Using a Deep-Learning-Based Artificial Neural Network Algorithm-Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.']"""

Core2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (GCNT1) is a key enzyme that forms core 2-branched O-glycans. Its expression is associated with the progression of several cancers. We established a mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GCNT1 and examined the relationship of GCNT1 expression to the clinicopathological status of PCa. Paraffin-embedded PCa specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for GCNT1 expression using a newly established mouse anti-GCNT1 mAb by ourselves. GCNT1-positive tumor showed significantly higher Gleason score and larger tumor volume. The number of GCNT1-positive cases was significantly lower in cases of organ-confined disease than in cases of extracapsular extension. GCNT1-negative tumors were associated with significantly better prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-free survival compared with GCNT1-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that detection of GCNT1 expression was an independent risk factor for PSA recurrence. We established new methods for GCNT1 detection from PCa specimens. Immunoblotting was used to examine post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine from PCa patients. Over 90% of GCNT1-positive PCa patients with high concentrations of PSA showed extracapsular extension. In conclusion, GCNT1 expression closely associates with the aggressive potential of PCa.

Case report:   An 89-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, mild dementia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia presented to the emergency department with an episode of syncope. Physical examination demonstrated normal and regular heart sounds, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Echocardiogram described a well-circumscribed echo-dense mass in the right atrial cavity, which was attached to the septum but not obstructing the tricuspid annulus, measuring 1.7×2.2 cm at its widest diameter. Cardiac MRI revealed a mass with dark intensity which enhanced heterogeneously following intravenous administration of gadolinium-chelate, consistent with a myxoma. The location of this myxoma, coupled with the presence of a stalk allowing mobility, provides a clue to how this patient experienced transient obstruction of the tricuspid valve leading to syncope.

Results:   High symptom burden was reported across all domains (sexual 44.4%, urinary 14.4%, vitality 12.7%, bowel 8.4%, emotional 7.6%) with over half of respondents (56%) reporting they needed more information. Top information needs involved recurrence, relationships, and long-term effects.

In this report, microcontact-PSA imprinted (PSA-MIP) capacitive biosensor chip was developed for real-time, highly sensitive and selective detection of PSA. PSA-MIP electrodes were prepared in the presence of methacrylic acid (MAA) as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker via UV polymerization. Immobilized Anti-PSA antibodies on electrodes (Anti-PSA) for capacitance measurements were also prepared to compare the detection performances of both methods. The electrodes were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) and real-time PSA detection was performed with standard PSA solutions in the concentration range of 10 fg mL(-1)-100 ng mL(-1). The detection limits were found as 8.0 × 10(-5) ng mL(-1) (16 × 10(-17) M) and 6.0 × 10(-4) ng mL(-1) (12 × 10(-16) M) for PSA-MIP and Anti-PSA electrodes, respectively. Selectivity studies were performed against HSA and IgG and selectivity coefficients were calculated. PSA detection was also carried out from diluted human serum samples and finally, reproducibility of the electrodes was tested. The results are promising and show that when the sensitivity of the capacitive system is combined with the selectivity and reproducibility of the microcontact-imprinting procedure, the resulting system might be used successfully for real-time detection of various analytes even in very low concentrations.""","""['Gizem Ertürk', 'Martin Hedström', 'M Aşkın Tümer', 'Adil Denizli', 'Bo Mattiasson']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Whole cell based microcontact imprinted capacitive biosensor for the detection of Escherichia coli.', 'Dual-modality impedimetric immunosensor for early detection of prostate-specific antigen and myoglobin markers based on antibody-molecularly imprinted polymer.', 'Microcontact-BSA imprinted capacitive biosensor for real-time, sensitive and selective detection of BSA.', 'Capacitive Biosensors and Molecularly Imprinted Electrodes.', 'A novel classification of prostate specific antigen (PSA) biosensors based on transducing elements.', 'Microcontact-Imprinted Optical Sensors for Virulence Factors of Periodontal Disease.', 'A review of Optical Point-of-Care devices to Estimate the Technology Transfer of These Cutting-Edge Technologies.', 'Protposer: The web server that readily proposes protein stabilizing mutations with high PPV.', 'Highly portable quantitative screening test for prostate-specific antigen at point of care.', 'Microfluidic Systems for Cancer Diagnosis and Applications.']"""

Validation of mouse and human prostate cancer models confirmed the specificity and synergy of a predicted drug combination to abrogate FOXM1/CENPF activity and inhibit tumorigenicity.

Design:   Three of ten PLCO screening centers queried participants towards the end of the study (2010) as to their opinions of the various retention materials and whether they would have been willing to use electronic communication for study activities, had the option been available.  Setting:   The questionnaires were administered by mail, and responses were returned to the originating screening center.

However, up to date, the exact role of Stat5a in breast cancer is still not clear. The data reported are conflicting. D5 Stat5a is a variant of Stat5a we cloned recently. This newly cloned variant behave like its full length counterpart in terms of dimerization, being activated by prolactin and nuclear translocation, however it also behave differently in terms of effect on cell proliferation and interaction with other transcription factors. In the present study, we examined its effect on cell proliferation of cultured breast cancer cells (MCF-10A and MCF-7) by using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and MTS technology. Also, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) and Western blot were used to probe the possible changes of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7) expression including mRNA and protein, and the epigenetic changes with overexpression of this newly cloned variant. The results clarified that D5 Stat5a (1) behaves as a promoting factor to the cell proliferation of MCF-10A and MCF-7, (2) induces enhancer of zeste homology 2 (EZH2) expression in breast epithelial cells, as well as histone 3 trimethylation of IGFBP-7 promoter region, and (3) lower IGFBP-7 expression was detected in breast cancer tissue. Taking together, we concluded that the mitogenic effect of D5 Stat5a on breast cells is, at least partly, through up-regulation of histone methyltransferase, EZH2, and therefore inhibiting IGFBP-7 expression by increasing H3K27Me3 of IGFBP-7 promoter region.""","""['Dunyong Tan', 'Jie Zhang', 'Xi Nie', 'Chao Yu', 'Zhongzheng Li', 'Zulbnur Mamat', 'Huang Jiang', 'Xiaomeng Yang', 'Jiao Zhang', 'Sihong Yao', 'Peizhi Tang', 'Jianjun Huang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['Histone trimethylation of the p53 gene by expression of a constitutively active prolactin receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression of a constitutively active prolactin receptor causes histone trimethylation of the p53 gene in breast cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation of cell adhesion and communication by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in human endothelial cells.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A/B in prostate and breast cancers.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a/b: biomarker and therapeutic target in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis in different molecular portraits of breast cancer treated with silver nanoparticles and its pathway-network analysis.']"""

To address uncertainty over the causal nature of previous observational findings, we investigated associations of height- and adiposity-related genetic variants with prostate cancer risk and mortality.  Methods:   We conducted a case-control study based on 20,848 prostate cancers and 20,214 controls of European ancestry from 22 studies in the PRACTICAL consortium. We constructed genetic risk scores that summed each man's number of height and BMI increasing alleles across multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated with each phenotype from published genome-wide association studies.  Results:   The genetic risk scores explained 6.31 and 1.46% of the variability in height and BMI, respectively. There was only weak evidence that genetic variants previously associated with increased BMI were associated with a lower prostate cancer risk (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in BMI genetic score 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 1.00; p = 0.07). Genetic variants associated with increased height were not associated with prostate cancer incidence (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97, 1.01; p = 0.23), but were associated with an increase (OR 1.13; 95 % CI 1.08, 1.20) in prostate cancer mortality among low-grade disease (p heterogeneity, low vs. high grade <0.001). Genetic variants associated with increased BMI were associated with an increase (OR 1.08; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.14) in all-cause mortality among men with low-grade disease (p heterogeneity = 0.03).  Conclusions:   We found little evidence of a substantial effect of genetically elevated height or BMI on prostate cancer risk, suggesting that previously reported observational associations may reflect common environmental determinants of height or BMI and prostate cancer risk. Genetically elevated height and BMI were associated with increased mortality (prostate cancer-specific and all-cause, respectively) in men with low-grade disease, a potentially informative but novel finding that requires replication.""","""['Neil M Davies', 'Tom R Gaunt', 'Sarah J Lewis', 'Jeff Holly', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'John P Kemp', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Doug Easton', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Sara Benlloch', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Graham G Giles', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Børge G Nordestgaard', 'Ruth C Travis', 'David Neal', 'Nora Pashayan', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Janet L Stanford', 'William J Blot', 'Stephen Thibodeau', 'Christiane Maier', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Lisa Cannon-Albright', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Jong Park', 'Radka Kaneva', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Hardev Pandha;PRACTICAL consortium;Mark Lathrop', 'George Davey Smith', 'Richard M Martin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Mendelian randomization study of adiposity-related traits and risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer.', 'Association between Adult Height and Risk of Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer: Results from Meta-analyses of Prospective Studies and Mendelian Randomization Analyses.', 'Adiposity, metabolites, and colorectal cancer risk: Mendelian randomization study.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and prostate cancer.', 'Genetic association of mosaic loss of chromosome Y with prostate cancer in men of European and East Asian ancestries: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'The timing of adiposity and changes in the life course on the risk of cancer.', 'Your height affects your health: genetic determinants and health-related outcomes in Taiwan.', 'The Causal Relationships Between Extrinsic Exposures and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Phenome-Wide Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Recommendations on Weight Loss and Healthy Lifestyle in Prostate Cancer Clinical Guidelines: A Systematic Review.']"""

Repurposing the data provides an unparalleled resource for matching patients with the outcomes of demographically or diagnostically comparable patients. A web-based application was developed to query this subset of patient information against a given patient's demographics and risk factors. Analysis of the matched data yields outcome information which can then be used to guide management decisions and imaging software. Prognostic information is also estimated via the proportion of matched patients that progress to cancer. The US Preventative Services Task Force provides screening recommendations for cancers of the breast, colorectal tract, and lungs. There is wide variability in adherence of clinicians to these guidelines and others published by the Fleischner Society and various cancer organizations. Data mining the PLCO dataset for clinical decision support can optimize the use of limited healthcare resources, focusing screening on patients for whom the benefit to risk ratio is the greatest and most efficacious. A data driven, personalized approach to cancer screening maximizes the economic and clinical efficacy and enables early identification of patients in which the course of disease can be improved.

We investigated it in a large population-based case-control study.  Methods:   Cases were 1937 men with incident prostate cancer, aged ≤ 75 years, diagnosed across French hospitals in the Montreal area between 2005 and 2009. Concurrently, 1995 population controls from the same residential area and age distribution were randomly selected from electoral list of French-speaking men. Detailed lifestyle and medical histories, and anthropometric measures, were collected during in-person interviews. Prevalence of MetS components (type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and abdominal obesity) was estimated at 2 years before diagnosis for cases/ interview for controls, and at ages 20, 40, 50 and 60. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals for the association between MetS and prostate cancer risk.  Results:   A history of MetS (≥ 3 components vs < 3) was associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (OR = 0.70 [0.60, 0.82]) after considering potential confounders. The negative association was particularly pronounced with a young age (≤ 40 years) at MetS onset (OR = 0.38 [0.16-0.89]), did not vary according to prostate cancer aggressiveness, and was only partly explained by the presence of type 2 diabetes. A risk decrease was observed with the number of MetS components, suggesting a synergistic interaction of the components.  Discussion:   The observed negative association, consistent with results from other North American populations undergoing regular prostate cancer screening, underlines the importance of considering PSA-testing when studying the MetS-prostate cancer association.

Systemic and local androgen bioavailability is controlled by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases conjugating enzymes (UGT), namely UGT2B15, UGT2B17 and UGT2B28. Reporter vector assays in HEK293 cells initially validated in silico-predicted regulatory potential of candidate miRNAs to target UGT transcripts, including miR-376c, miR-409 and miR-494 for UGT2B17, miR-331-5p and miR-376c for UGT2B15 while none were efficient for UGT2B28. miR-376c was shown as the most effective to downregulate UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 through interactions with a site conserved in both UGTs. Ectopic miR-376c expression in prostate cancer cells significantly reduced UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression (>32%; P<0.005) with a consequent decrease in dihydrotestosterone glucuronidation (-37%; P<0.001). Consistent with reduced androgen inactivation, ectopic expression of miR-376c changed expression of androgen responsive genes and enhanced cell proliferation with no effect on androgen receptor levels. Sustaining a role of miR-376c in the regulation of androgen-inactivating UGTs, its expression was significantly downregulated in prostatic tumors and further reduced in metastases (P<0.0001), whereas the opposite was observed for UGT2B15/17 (P=0.031). In high-grade tumors (Gleason ≥8), UGT2B15/17 and miR-376c were inversely correlated (r=-0.557; P=0.048) with also a significant relationship in metastases (r=-0.747; P=0.003). In line with a modification in androgen bioavailability, PSA mRNA levels were also negatively correlated to those of UGT2B15/17 (r=-0.573; P=0.01) but positively linked to levels of miR-376c (r=0.577; P=0.039).

Cell survival assays detected by MTS assay showed that prostate cell lines treated with a combination of radiation and TRA-8 showed significantly lower survival than cells treated with either radiation or TRA-8 alone. Colony forming assay and cell proliferation assays showed increased killing after combination treatment with TRA-8 or Ad/TRAIL and radiation, than either single agent alone.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated data on 541 patients undergoing AS between 1995 and 2011. PSA variation was described by studying the Kaplan-Meier probability of patients' PSA levels reaching 4 or 7 ng/mL, falling below those thresholds, and then rising to those thresholds again. We also examined PSA variation by calculating the Kaplan-Meier probability of a PSA change followed by an equal or greater change in the opposite direction.  Results:   We analysed data on 541 patients undergoing AS with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 8 (6-12) PSA measurements and undergoing AS for a median (IQR) of 4 (2-6) years. The 5-year estimate of the probability of reaching a threshold PSA of 7 ng/mL was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35-46%) and the 5-year estimate of subsequently falling below this threshold was 90% (95% CI 82-95%). The 5-year estimate of a PSA direction change was 95% (95% CI 93-97%) overall and 56% (95% CI 51-61%) for PSA direction changes of ≥1 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   We observed a high probability of variability in PSA levels for patients on AS. The probability of changes in PSA, defined by an increase to the specified thresholds or a rise >1 ng/mL within 6 months and subsequent decrease of equal or greater value on a subsequent measurement, increases over time; therefore, a single change in PSA level is not a reliable endpoint for patients on AS.""","""['Behfar Ehdaie', 'Bing Ying Poon', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Pedro Recabal', 'Vincent Laudone', 'Karim Touijer', 'James Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comprehensive analysis of post-diagnostic prostate-specific antigen kinetics as predictor of a prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients.', 'Feasibility study: watchful waiting for localized low to intermediate grade prostate carcinoma with selective delayed intervention based on prostate specific antigen, histological and/or clinical progression.', 'Evaluation of changes in prostate specific antigen in clinically localized prostate cancer managed without initial therapy.', 'Validity of prostate-specific antigen as a tumour marker in men with prostate cancer managed by watchful-waiting: correlation with findings at serial endorectal magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic imaging.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer: the need to standardize.', 'Clinical proteomics for prostate cancer: understanding prostate cancer pathology and protein biomarkers for improved disease management.', 'Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'Salvage Therapy Options for Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Primary Radiotherapy: a Literature Review.', 'Prostate-specific antigen reduction after empiric antibiotic treatment does not rule out biopsy in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: prospective, controlled, single-center study.', 'The Role of Proteomics in Biomarker Development for Improved Patient Diagnosis and Clinical Decision Making in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We conducted a subgroup analysis of 61 men with prostate cancer (PCa) detected by 10-core RB but with a negative TB, from a cohort of 408 men with suspicious multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) between January 2012 and January 2015. A consensus re-reading of mpMRI results (using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] versions 1 and 2) for each suspicious lesion was performed, with the image reader blinded to the biopsy results, followed by an unblinded anatomical correlation of the lesion on mpMRI to the biopsy result. The potential reasons for TB failure were estimated for each lesion. We defined clinically significant PCa according to the Epstein criteria and stratified patients into risk groups according to the European Association of Urology guidelines.  Results:   Our analysis showed that RB detected significant PCa in 64% of patients (39/61) and intermediate-/high-risk PCa in 57% of patients (35/61). The initial mpMRI reading identified 90 suspicious lesions in the cohort. Blinded consensus re-reading of the mpMRI led to PI-RADS score downgrading of 45 lesions (50%) and upgrading of 13 lesions (14%); thus, negative TB could be explained by falsely high initial PI-RADS scores for 32 lesions (34%) and sampling of the target lesion by RB in the corresponding anatomical site for 36 out of 90 lesions (40%) in 35 of 61 patients (57%). Sampling of the target lesion by RB was most likely for lesions with PI-RADS scores of 4/5 and Gleason scores (GS) of ≥7. A total of 70 PCa lesions (67% with GS 6) in 44 patients (72%) were sampled from prostatic sites with no abnormalities on mpMRI.  Conclusion:   In cases of TB failure, RB still detected a high rate of significant PCa. The main reason for a negative TB was a TB error, compensated for by positive sampling of the target lesion by the additional RB, and the second reason for TB failure was a falsely high initial PI-RADS score. The challenges that arise for both MRI diagnostics and prostate lesion sampling are evident in our data and support the integration of RB into the TB workflow.""","""['Hannes Cash', 'Karsten Günzel', 'Andreas Maxeiner', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Thomas Fischer', 'Tahir Durmus', 'Kurt Miller', 'Patrick Asbach', 'Matthias Haas', 'Carsten Kempkensteffen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-fusion biopsy: behind the scenes.', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of free-hand transperineal targeted prostate biopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion in Chinese men with prior negative biopsy and elevated prostate-specific antigen.', 'Targeted MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy in men with previous prostate biopsies using a novel registration software and multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores: first results.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Follow-up of men with a PI-RADS 4/5 lesion after negative MRI/Ultrasound fusion biopsy.', 'Predicting the Performance of Concurrent Systematic Random Biopsies during Image Fusion Targeted Sampling of Multi-Parametric MRI Detected Prostate Cancer.

Nurse-led care, comprising an explicit nurse-led protocol with support from urologists, was developed as part of the AM arm of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial.  Design:   Interviews and questionnaire surveys of clinicians, nurses and patients assessed acceptability.  Setting:   Nurse-led clinics were established in 9 centres in the ProtecT trial and compared with 3 non-ProtecT urology centres elsewhere in UK.  Participants:   Within ProtecT, 22 men receiving AM nurse-led care were interviewed about experiences of care; 11 urologists and 23 research nurses delivering ProtecT trial care completed a questionnaire about its acceptability; 20 men managed in urology clinics elsewhere in the UK were interviewed about models of AS/AM care; 12 urologists and three specialist nurses working in these clinics were also interviewed about management of AS/AM.  Results:   Nurse-led care was commended by ProtecT trial participants, who valued the flexibility, accessibility and continuity of the service and felt confident about the quality of care. ProtecT consultant urologists and nurses also rated it highly, identifying continuity of care and resource savings as key attributes. Clinicians and patients outside the ProtecT trial believed that nurse-led care could relieve pressure on urology clinics without compromising patient care.  Conclusions:   The ProtecT AM nurse-led model of care was acceptable to men with localised prostate cancer and clinical specialists in urology.

Patients and methods:   The study focused on 1 860 patients with cT1a kidney cancer treated with either LTA or OBS between 2000 and 2009 in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. Propensity-score matching was used. The study outcome was CSM. Multivariable competing risks regression analyses, adjusting for other-cause mortality as well as patient (including comorbidities) and tumour characteristics, were fitted.  Results:   Overall, fewer patients underwent LTA than OBS (30 vs 70%; n = 553 vs n = 1 307). Compared with patients in the OBS group, those in the LTA group were younger (median age 77 vs 78 years; P < 0.001), more likely to be white (84 vs 78%; P = 0.005), more frequently married (59 vs 52%; P = 0.02) and more frequently of high socio-economic status (54 vs 45%; P = 0.001). After propensity-score matching, 553 patients who underwent LTA and 553 who underwent OBS remained for subsequent analyses. The mean standardized differences of patient characteristics between the two groups were <10%, indicating a high degree of similarity. After LTA or OBS, the 5-year CSM estimates from Poisson regression-derived smoothed plots were 3.5 and 9.1%, respectively. In multivariable competing risks regression analyses, LTA use was found to have a protective effect on CSM (hazard ratio 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.89]; P = 0.02).

However, in some cases, biochemical recurrence associated with imaging-detected nodal metastases may happen. Herein, we aim to present the surgical technique for salvage lymph node dissection after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A 70 year-old asymptomatic man presented with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 7.45 ng/mL. Digital rectal examination was normal and trans-rectal prostate biopsy revealed a prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason 7 (3+4). Pre-operative computed tomography scan and bone scintigraphy showed no metastatic disease. In other service, the patient underwent a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy plus obturador lymphadenectomy. Pathologic examination showed a pT3aN0 tumor. After 6 months of follow-up, serum PSA was 1.45 ng/mL. Further investigation with 11C--Choline PET/CT revealed only a 2-cm lymph node close to the left internal iliac artery. The patient was counseled for salvage lymph node dissection.  Results:   Salvage lymph node dissection was uneventfully performed. Operative time was 1.5 hour, blood loss was minimal, and there were no intra- or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged from hospital in the 1st postoperative day. After 12 months of follow-up, his PSA was undetectable with no other adjuvant therapy.  Conclusion:   Robotic salvage pelvic lymph node dissection is an effective option for treatment of patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and only pelvic lymph node metastasis detected by C11-Choline PET/CT.""","""['Fabio C M Torricelli', 'Arnaldo Cividanes', 'Giuliano B Guglielmetti', 'Rafael F Coelho']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Image-guided percutaneous targeting of lymph nodes: a novel approach for salvage pelvic lymphadenectomy in recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Targeted salvage lymphadenectomy in patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence: complete biochemical response without adjuvant therapy in patients with low volume lymph node recurrence over a long-term follow-up.', 'Robotic salvage lymph node dissection for nodal-only recurrences after radical prostatectomy: Perioperative and early oncological outcomes.', 'Robotic Salvage Lymph Node Dissection in Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Lessons Learned from 68 Cases and Implications for Future Clinical Management.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Image-guided percutaneous targeting of lymph nodes: a novel approach for salvage pelvic lymphadenectomy in recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Robot assisted lymphadenectomy in urology: pelvic, retroperitoneal and inguinal.', 'PET imaging for lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.']"""

A national Danish study""","""Background:   The purpose of this observational cohort study was to evaluate the outcome and prognostic factors following salvage radiotherapy (SRT) in a consecutive national cohort.  Material and methods:   Between 2006 and 2010, 259 patients received SRT in Denmark. Patient- and cancer-related characteristics were retrospectively retrieved from patient charts. The primary end point was biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS).  Results:   At the end of follow-up, 51% of the patients displayed a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level <0.1 ng/ml. The three-year b-PFS rate for the total cohort was 57.0%. Nearly half of the patients (44%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with SRT. Positive surgical tumour margins (p = 0.025) and ADT (p = 0.001) were the only markers independently correlated with b-PFS. In patients who received SRT without ADT, both a pre-SRT PSA level ≤0.5 ng/ml (p = 0.003) and pathological tumour stage T1-T2 (p = 0.036) independently correlated with b-PFS. Moreover, a duration between radical prostatectomy (RP) and SRT ≤29 months (p = 0.035) independently correlated with b-PFS in patients treated with ADT in combination with RT.  Conclusions:   In patients treated for biochemical failure after RP, positive surgical tumour margins and PSA levels ≤0.5 ng/mL at the time of SRT were associated with a favourable outcome. Despite less favourable tumour characteristics, patients receiving SRT and ADT demonstrated improved b-PFS, and in particular, patients with PSA levels >0.2 ng/ml benefitted from additional ADT.""","""['Maria Ervandian', 'Morten Høyer', 'Stine Elleberg Petersen', 'Lisa Sengeløv', 'Steinbjørn Hansen', 'Mats Holmberg', 'Joen Sveistrup', 'Peter Meidahl Petersen', 'Michael Borre']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Long-term outcomes after high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation treatment.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant or Salvage Setting: A Systematic Review.', 'Pathological stage, surgical margin and lymphovascular invasion as prognostic factors after salvage radiotherapy for post-prostatectomy relapsed prostate cancer - outcomes and optimization strategies.', 'Effect of Salvage Radiotherapy and Endocrine Therapy on Patients with Biochemical Recurrence After Prostate Cancer Operation- a Meta‑Analysis.', 'Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Outcome after PSMA PET/CT based salvage radiotherapy in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a bi-institutional retrospective analysis.']"""

However, radical perineal prostatectomy has some advantages with regard to operative complications. Here I evaluate 200 cases for which the perineal approach was used in the past 12 years.  Materials and methods:   From 2000 to 2012, radical perineal prostatectomies were performed for 200 patients and their operative complications were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 years, with a PSA of 9.4 ng/ml, and Gleason score of 6.9. Their clinical stages were T1 in 168 cases (84.0%), T2 in 26 (13.0%) and T3 in 6 (3.0%).  Results:   Mean operative time was 85 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 220.0 ml. The median time for urethral catheter indwelling was 7 days, and the admission term was 14 days. Operations were performed safely in patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2. Lymphadenectomies from the same incision were performed in 20 cases and there were no lymph node metastases. Rectal injuries occurred in 7 cases (3.5%) with 100 cases of Blet's approach so I changed to Young's approach. With Young's approach I have not experienced any rectal injuries. Wound infection occurred in 4 cases (2.0%), hematoma in 2 (1.0%), anastomotic stricture in 1 (0.5%), inguinal hernia in 1 (0.5%), and transient lower extremity neurapraxia in 1 (0.5%). Postperineal pain after operation was tolerated using a donut cushion, though some pain relievers were needed in 20 cases (10.0%). Fecal incontinence occurred in 4 cases (2.0%) but was temporary.  Conclusions:   With radical perineal prostatectomy it is easy to perform vesicourethral anastomosis, apical dissection and nerve sparing, and there are few complications such as inguinal hernia, anastomotic stricture and so on. In addition, there is less blood loss with this approach because the dorsal vein complex and pudendal arteries are out of sight. Therefore, radical perineal prostatectomy is suggested to be useful because of its safety, short operation time and low cost. Finally this procedure can be selected as the first choice for patients with past history of lower abdominal operation and obesity.""","""['Seiichi Saito']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Perineal versus retropubic radical prostatectomy for T1, T2 prostate cancer.', 'Celioscopic lymphatic excision and perineal radical prostatectomy: a strategy for the treatment of prostatic cancer.', 'Complications and incidences in our first 250 robotic radical prostatectomies.', 'Risk factors and prevention of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Relative advantages and disadvantages of radical perineal prostatectomy versus radical retropubic prostatectomy.']"""

Here we describe a general pipeline in which candidate functional SNPs are first evaluated by fine mapping, epigenomic profiling, and epigenome editing, and then interrogated for causal function by using genome editing to create isogenic cell lines followed by phenotypic characterization. To validate this approach, we analyzed the 6q22.1 prostate cancer risk locus and identified rs339331 as the top-scoring SNP. Epigenome editing confirmed that the rs339331 region possessed regulatory potential. By using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome editing, we created a panel of isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines representing all three genotypes (TT, TC, CC) at rs339331. Introduction of the 'T' risk allele increased transcription of the regulatory factor 6 (RFX6) gene, increased homeobox B13 (HOXB13) binding at the rs339331 region, and increased deposition of the enhancer-associated H3K4me2 histone mark at the rs339331 region compared to lines homozygous for the 'C' protective allele.

Rectum is especially vulnerable to secondary radiation injury resulting in proctitis. The most common and life-threatening symptom is rectal hemorrhage. Formalin application into the rectum causes local cauterization of telangiectatic mucosal vessels. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of local formalin application in patients with hemorrhagic radiation proctitis.  Methods:   A solution of 4.0% formalin was used in the treatment of 20 patients with clinical and proctoscopic evidence of radiadion proctitis. Treatment involved direct application of 4.0% formalin into the rectum. All patients were followed-up in terms of complete resolution of symptoms or recurrences of bleeding.  Results:   A total of 20 patients with a mean age of 69.7 (range, 57-80) years were followed for 51.2 (range, 1-93) months. The mean duration of symptoms was 4.5 (range, 1-10) months and the interval between the end of radiotherapy and symptoms was mostly between 5 and 30 months. Patients required an average of 2 (range, 1-5) formalin treatments. Of the 20 patients, 10 had complete resolution of their symptoms after their first treatment. In 10 patients bleeding recurred and they were offered another formalin instillation and/or 5-ASA suppositories and argon therapy. Complete resolution of symptoms was achieved in all patients.  Conclusions:   Topical formalin instillation is effective, safe, and well-tolerated method for the patients with radiation proctopathy.

Patients and methods:   The cohort consisted of 130 consecutive patients who underwent RALP in a tertiary-care hospital between July 2012 and June 2013. The first 70 patients did not undergo PVC reconstruction with Kim's stitch and formed the control group. The subsequent 60 patients underwent Kim's stitch and formed the intervention (Kim's stitch) group. The primary outcome measure was degree of urinary continence assessed 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Questionnaire. Continence was compared between the two groups using propensity scores and inverse-probability weighting to adjust for treatment selection bias. To evaluate adverse treatment effects, all patients underwent uroflowmetry before and 1 month after surgery.  Results:   The prevalence of continence at 1, 3, and 6 months was 23.9%, 57.7%, and 77.6%, respectively, in the control group and 25.9%, 60.0%, and 89.7%, respectively, in the Kim's stitch group.

Many CTC isolation technologies have been developed. We optimized the Parsortix system, an epitope independent, size and compressibility-based platform for CTCs isolation, making it possible to harvest CTCs at the speed and sample volume comparable to standard CellSearch system. We captured more than half of cancer cells from different cancer cell lines spiked in blood samples from healthy donors using this system. Cell loss during immunostaining of cells transferred and fixed on the slides is a major problem for analyzing rare cell samples. We developed a novel cell transfer and fixation method to retain >90% of cells on the slide after the immunofluorescence process without affecting signal strength and specificity. Using this optimized method, we evaluated the Parsortix system for CTC harvest in prostate cancer patients in comparison to immunobead based CTC isolation systems IsoFlux and CellSearch. We harvested a similar number (p = 0.33) of cytokeratin (CK) positive CTCs using Parsortix and IsoFlux from 7.5 mL blood samples of 10 prostate cancer patients (an average of 33.8 and 37.6 respectively). The purity of the CTCs harvested by Parsortix at 3.1% was significantly higher than IsoFlux at 1.0% (p = 0.02). Parsortix harvested significantly more CK positive CTCs than CellSearch (p = 0.04) in seven prostate cancer patient samples, where both systems were utilized (an average of 32.1 and 10.1 respectively). We also captured CTC clusters using Parsortix. Using four-color immunofluorescence we found that 85.8% of PC3 cells expressed EpCAM, 91.7% expressed CK and 2.5% cells lacked both epithelial markers. Interestingly, 95.6% of PC3 cells expressed Vimentin, including those cells that lacked both epithelial marker expression, indicating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. CK-positive/Vimentin-positive/CD45-negative, and CK-negative/Vimentin-positive/CD45-negative cells were also observed in four of five prostate cancer patients but rarely in three healthy controls, indicating that Parsortix harvests CTCs with both epithelial and mesenchymal features.

Activities of caspases were assayed, as well as protein expression of cancer‑related proteins KLF5, Stat5b and ICAM-1 in PC3 cells. The therapeutic effect of ABL-N was further evaluated in our tumor xenografts. ABL-N inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, without obvious effect on normal human prostate epithelial PrEC cells. ABL-N administration induced apoptosis of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, along with the enhanced activity of caspases and increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

The reference standards were histopathologic result, decrease in prostate-specific antigen level after salvage radiation therapy, and follow-up findings. Using a 5-point scoring system, two reviewers independently interpreted T2-weighted images alone (protocol A), a combination of T2-weighted and DW images (protocol B), a combination of T2-weighted and DCE images (protocol C), and a combination of T2-weighted, DW, and DCE images (protocol D).

One of the main challenges in adopting focal boost or true focal therapy is in the accurate mapping of cancer foci defined on magnetic resonance (MR) images onto the computerised tomography (CT) images used for radiotherapy planning.  Material and methods:   Prostate cancer patients (n = 14) previously treated at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre (ECC) were selected for this study. All patients underwent MR scanning for the purpose of diagnosis and staging. Patients received three months of androgen deprivation hormone therapy followed by a radiotherapy planning CT scan. The dominant focal prostate lesions were identified on MR scans by a radiologist and a novel image analysis approach was used to map the location of the dominant focal lesion from MR to CT. An offline planning study was undertaken on suitable patients (n = 7) to investigate boosting of the radiation dose to the tumour using a stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) technique.  Results:   The non-rigid registration algorithm showed clinically acceptable estimates of the location of the dominant focal disease on all CT image data of patients suitable for a boost treatment. Standard rigid registration was found to produce unacceptable estimates of the dominant focal lesion on CT. A SABR boost dose of 47.5 Gy was delivered to the dominant focal lesion of all patients whilst meeting all dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the rectum decreased from 1.28% to 0.73% with this method.  Conclusions:   These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of this image analysis method for reliably mapping dominant focal disease within the prostate from MR images onto planning CT images.

The sensitivity of prostatic biopsy is about 50%. The fusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with TRUS enables the targeted biopsy of suspicious areas. We studied whether this improves the detection of prostate cancer.  Methods:   168 men with suspected prostate cancer underwent prostate MRI after a previous negative biopsy. Suspicious lesions were assessed with the classification of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System and biopsied in targeted fashion with the aid of fused MRI and TRUS. At the same sitting, a systematic biopsy with at least 12 biopsy cores was performed.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 71 patients (42.3%; 95% CI, 35.05-49.82). The detection rate of fusion-assisted targeted biopsy was 19% (95% CI, 13.83-25.65), compared to 37.5% (95% CI, 30.54-45.02) with systematic biopsy. Clinically significant cancer was more commonly revealed by targeted biopsy (84.4%; 95% CI, 68.25-93.14) than by systematic biopsy (65.1%; 95% CI, 52.75-75.67). In 7 patients with normal MRI findings, cancer was detected by systematic biopsy alone. Compared to systematic biopsy, targeted biopsy had a higher overall detection rate (16.5% vs. 6.3%), a higher rate of infiltration per core (30% vs. 10%), and a higher rate of detection of poorly differentiated carcinoma (18.5% vs. 3%).

Materials and methods:   Ninety patients undergoing 3T prostate MRI before prostatectomy were included. Two independent readers (R1, R2) recorded for each lobe the presence or absence of capsular irregularity on T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) and of overt measurable EPE. Readers also recorded the length of capsular contact of each lobe's dominant lesion for T2 WI and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Based on prostatectomy specimens, EPE was recorded for each lobe and classified as focal (single focus ≤0.5 mm in depth) vs. established. Receiver operating characteristic analysis, logistic regression, and kappa coefficients were used to assess interpretive approaches on a side-specific basis.  Results:   The optimal thresholds were 6 mm and 7 mm of contact using T2 WI and ADC for any EPE, and 10 mm and 7 mm using T2 WI and ADC for nonfocal EPE (AUCs 81.0-82.5%). Capsular contact had higher sensitivity, yet lower specificity, than subjective interpretations for any EPE and for nonfocal EPE (all P ≤ 0.018, aside from any EPE for R2 using ADC). Length of contact exhibited more substantial gains in sensitivity (9-20% for any EPE; 34-41% for nonfocal EPE) than losses in specificity (6-13% for any EPE; 17-27% for nonfocal EPE) compared with subjective interpretations. Interreader agreement: 0.70 for assessments based on length of contact; 0.49-0.59 for subjective assessments.  Conclusion:   Length of capsular contact of dominant lesions can improve interreader agreement and sensitivity for EPE compared with subjective features, with relatively mild specificity loss.""","""['Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Alampady K Shanbhogue', 'Annie Wang', 'Max Xiangtian Kong', 'James S Babb', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Evaluation of MRI for diagnosis of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of apparent diffusion coefficient and MR volumetry as independent associative factors for extra-prostatic extension (EPE) in prostatic carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of the most optimal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging sequence for determining pathological length of capsular contact.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Multiparametric prostate MRI: focus on T2-weighted imaging and role in staging of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', '3D-Reconstructed Contact Surface Area and Tumour Volume on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Improve the Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative imaging parameters to predict the local staging of prostate cancer in intermediate- to high-risk patients.', 'Current Opinion on the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Staging Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.']"""

Methods:   We studied 57 patients with early prostate cancer who were treated with free (125)I transperineal brachytherapy. Scintigraphy was used to detect seed migration on postoperative day (POD) 1, radiography was used on POD 2, and both tests were used on POD 30.  Results:   The total number of implanted seeds in this study was 3,753 in 57 patients. Overall, there were 19 seed migrations in 12 patients. On POD 1, there were 4 seed migrations in 4 patients that were detected by scintigraphy. On POD 2, there were 10 seed migrations in 9 patients that were detected by radiography. On POD 30, 17 seed migrations were detected in 10 patients by radiography and 18 seeds migrations were detected by scintigraphy. However, 1 seed migration which was located outside of the detectable range of radiography was detected only by scintigraphy.  Conclusions:   Both scintigraphy and radiography have similar abilities to detect migrated seeds 1 month after (125)I brachytherapy for prostate cancer.

We describe an innovative approach for the selective and sensitive detection of the PCa biomarker sarcosine, obtained by a synergistic ECL-supramolecular approach, in which the free base form of sarcosine acts as co-reagent in a Ru(bpy)3(2+)-ECL process. We used magnetic micro-beads decorated with a supramolecular tetraphosphonate cavitand (Tiiii) for the selective capture of sarcosine hydrochloride in a complex matrix like urine. Sarcosine determination was then obtained with ECL measurements thanks to the complexation properties of Tiiii, with a protocol involving simple pH changes - to drive the capture-release process of sarcosine from the receptor - and magnetic micro-bead technology. With this approach we were able to measure sarcosine in the μM to mM window, a concentration range that encompasses the diagnostic urinary value of sarcosine in healthy subjects and PCa patients, respectively. These results indicate how this ECL-supramolecular approach is extremely promising for the detection of sarcosine and for PCa diagnosis and monitoring, and for the development of portable and more affordable devices.""","""['Giovanni Valenti', 'Enrico Rampazzo', 'Elisa Biavardi', 'Elena Villani', 'Giulio Fracasso', 'Massimo Marcaccio', 'Federico Bertani', 'Dunia Ramarli', 'Enrico Dalcanale', 'Francesco Paolucci', 'Luca Prodi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Faraday Discuss""","""['Efforts to resolve the contradictions in early diagnosis of prostate cancer: a comparison of different algorithms of sarcosine in urine.', 'A fluorescent probe based on a Tb3+/Cu2+ co-functionalized MOF for urinary sarcosine detection.', 'GC/MS-based metabolomic approach to validate the role of urinary sarcosine and target biomarkers for human prostate cancer by microwave-assisted derivatization.', 'Colorimetric determination of sarcosine in urine samples of prostatic carcinoma by mimic enzyme palladium nanoparticles.', 'Quantitative analysis of sarcosine with special emphasis on biosensors: a review.', 'Point-of-care diagnostics for rapid determination of prostate cancer biomarker sarcosine: application of disposable potentiometric sensor based on oxide-conductive polymer nanocomposite.', 'Endotoxin in Sepsis: Methods for LPS Detection and the Use of Omics Techniques.', 'Emerging Applications of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy in Tear Film Analysis.', 'Detection of anti-p53 autoantibodies in saliva using microfluidic chips for the rapid screening of oral cancer.', 'Disposable Paper-Based Biosensors for the Point-of-Care Detection of Hazardous Contaminations-A Review.']"""

However, whether miR-340 plays an important role in prostate cancer remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the expression pattern of miR-340 and its functional significance in prostate cancer. Results showed that miR-340 expression was frequently downregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and cancer tissues. miR-340 overexpression suppressed proliferative and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells. This overexpression also promoted prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Conversely, miR-340 silencing showed an opposite effect. Intriguingly, on the basis of bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-340 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the high-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5 (HMGN5). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis further verified the results and demonstrated that miR-340 regulated HMGN5 expression. Correlation analysis also showed that HMGN5 expression levels were significantly inversely correlated with the miR-340 expression in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, miR-340 overexpression significantly decreased the protein expression of cyclin B1, Bcl-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which are critical regulators for maintaining tumorigenic potential of cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of HMGN5 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-340 on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In summary, this study suggests that miR-340 suppresses the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the decreased miR-340 expression may contribute to the development and progression of prostate cancer through a mechanism that involves HMGN5. Thus, miR340 and its target gene HMGN5 can serve as potentially useful therapeutic candidates for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Pengtao Wei', 'Baoping Qiao', 'Qi Li', 'Xingtao Han', 'Han Zhang', 'Qingxiang Huo', 'Jiantao Sun']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['microRNA-183-3p Inhibits Progression of Human Prostate Cancer by Downregulating High-Mobility Group Nucleosome Binding Domain 5.', 'Overexpression of microRNA-495 suppresses the proliferation and invasion and induces the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by targeting high-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5.', 'MicroRNA-409-3p Represses Glioma Cell Invasion and Proliferation by Targeting High-Mobility Group Nucleosome-Binding Domain 5.', 'Research advances in HMGN5 and cancer.', 'MiR-138: A promising therapeutic target for cancer.', 'Exogenous HMGN2 inhibits the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cell lines.', 'The Role of miRNAs 340-5p, 92a-3p, and 381-3p in Patients with Endometriosis: A Plasma and Mesenchymal Stem-Like Cell Study.', 'HMGN5 Silencing Suppresses Cell Biological Progression via AKT/MAPK Pathway in Human Glioblastoma Cells.', 'MiRNA-Based Inspired Approach in Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1A Upregulates HMGN5 by Increasing the Expression of GATA1 and Plays a Role in Osteosarcoma Metastasis.']"""

On the other hand, galectin-3 also plays a key role in cancer progression and prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis, thereby offsetting the benefits of active targeting drugs. However, the relative contribution of the protective antiapoptotic effects of galectin-3 and the proapoptotic effects of galectin-3-targeted therapies has remained yet unrevealed. Here, we show that a galectin-3-binding peptide G3-C12 could reverse galectin-3 from foe to friend for active targeting delivery system. Results showed G3-C12 modified N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer doxorubicin conjugates (G3-C12-HPMA-Dox) could internalize into galectin-3 overexpressed PC-3 cells via a highly specific ligand-receptor pathway (2.2 times higher cellular internalization than HPMA-Dox). The internalized Dox stimulated the translocation of galectin-3 to the mitochondria to prevent from apoptosis. In turn, this caused G3-C12-HPMA-Dox to concentrate into the mitochondria after binding to galectin-3 intracellularly. Initially, mitochondrial galectin-3 weakened Dox-induced mitochondrial damage; however, as time progressed, G3-C12 active-mediation allowed increasing amounts of Dox to be delivered to the mitochondria, which eventually induced higher level of apoptosis than nontargeted copolymers. In addition, G3-C12 downregulates galectin-3 expression, 0.43 times lower than control cells, which could possibly be responsible for the suppressed cell migration. Thus, G3-C12 peptide exerts sequential targeting to both cell membrane and mitochondria via regulating galectin-3, and eventually reverses and overcomes the protective effects of galectin-3; therefore, it could be a promising agent for the treatment of galectin-3-overexpressing cancers.""","""['Wei Sun', 'Lian Li', 'Qingqing Yang', 'Wei Shan', 'Zhirong Zhang', 'Yuan Huang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Treatment of prostate carcinoma with (galectin-3)-targeted HPMA copolymer-(G3-C12)-5-Fluorouracil conjugates.', 'Two birds, one stone: dual targeting of the cancer cell surface and subcellular mitochondria by the galectin-3-binding peptide G3-C12.', 'Targeting prostate carcinoma by G3-C12 peptide conjugated N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers.', 'The role of galectin-3 in cancer drug resistance.', 'Galectin 3 as a guardian of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Glycomimetics for the inhibition and modulation of lectins.', 'The Synthesis and Preclinical Investigation of Lactosamine-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for the Detection of Galectin-3-Expressing Melanoma Cells.', 'Galectins Are Central Mediators of Immune Escape in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Galectin-3 inhibition boosts the therapeutic efficacy of Semliki Forest virus in pediatric osteosarcoma.', 'The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Potential of Galectin-3 in Cardiovascular Diseases.']"""

These shifts in kilo voltage-cone beam CT (kV-CBCT) image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were evaluated over the first 6 months of usage of a 6D robotic couch-top, ranking the treatment sites for which the two compensations are larger for patient set-up.  Methods:   The couch compensations of 2945 fractions for 376 consecutive patients treated on the PerfectPitch™ 6D couch (Varian(®) Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) were analysed. Among these patients, 169 were treated for brain, 111 for lung, 54 for liver, 26 for pancreas and 16 for prostate tumours. During the set-up, patient anatomy from planning CT was aligned to kV-CBCT, and 6D movements were executed. Information related to pitch and roll were extracted by proper querying of the Microsoft(®) SQL server (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) ARIA database (Varian Medical Systems). Mean values and standard deviations were calculated for all sites. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was performed.  Results:   Considering all the data, mean pitch and roll adjustments were -0.10° ± 0.92° and 0.12° ± 0.96°, respectively; mean absolute values for both adjustments were 0.58° ± 0.69° and 0.69° ± 0.72°, respectively. Brain treatments showed the highest mean absolute values for pitch and roll rotations (0.73° ± 0.69° and 0.80° ± 0.78°, respectively); the lowest values of 0.36° ± 0.47° and 0.49° ± 0.58° were found for pancreas.

Dosimetry effects are expected to be small but have not been reported. The study aims to characterize the seed movement and prostate deformation due to probe pressure and to estimate the effects on dosimetry.  Methods and materials:   C-arm fluoroscopy imaging was performed to reconstruct the implanted seed distributions (compressed and relaxed prostate) for 10 patients immediately after implantation. The compressed prostate was delineated on ultrasound and registered to the fluoroscopy-derived seed distribution via manual seed localization. Thin-plate spline mapping, generated with implanted seeds as control points, was used to characterize the deformation field and to infer the prostate contour in the absence of probe compression. Differences in TG-43 dosimetry for the compressed prostate and that on probe removal were calculated.  Results:   Systematic seed movement patterns were observed on probe removal. Elastic decompression was characterized by expansion in the anterior-posterior direction and contraction in the superior-inferior and lateral directions up to 4 mm. Bilateral shearing in the anterior direction was up to 6 mm, resulting in contraction of the 145 Gy prescription isodose line by 2 mm with potential consequences for the posterior-lateral margin. The average whole prostate D90 increased by 2% of prescription dose (6% max; p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The current investigation presents a novel study on ultrasound probe-induced deformation.

Previous studies have shown that BMSCs secrete factors that promote prostate cancer apoptosis or neuroendocrine differentiation. Because of the significance of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines in cytostasis and bone metastasis, the role of TGF-β signaling in the context of prostate cancer-BMSC interactions was investigated.  Methods:   The role of TGF-β family signaling in BMSC-induced apoptosis of lineage-related prostate cancer cells was investigated in live/dead assays. SMAD phosphorylation or activity during apoptosis and neuroendocrine differentiation was investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays, along with the ALK-4, -5, -7 kinase inhibitor, SB-431542.  Results:   Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells with SB-431542 resulted in significant reduction of apoptosis mediated by HS-5 BMSCs, supporting the involvement of TGF-β/SMAD signaling during this event. Interestingly, however, pre-treatment of BMSCs with TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) yielded a conditioned medium that elicited a marked reduction in prostate cancer death. Phosphorylated-SMAD2 (P-SMAD2) was activated in BMSC-triggered transdifferentiated prostate cancer cells, as demonstrated through immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assays. However, SB-431542 did not restore androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen levels down-regulated by BMSC-secreted factors. Prostate cancer cells induced to undergo neuroendocrine differentiation in a BMSC-independent mechanism also showed elevated levels of P-SMAD2.  Discussion:   Collectively, our findings indicate that: (1) TGF-β family cytokines or regulated factors secreted from BMSCs are involved in prostate cancer apoptosis; (2) TGF-β signaling in prostate cancer cells is induced during neuroendocrine differentiation; and (3) TGF-β1 stimulation of BMSCs alters paracrine signaling to create a permissive environment for prostate cancer survival, suggesting a mechanism for prostate cancer-mediated colonization of bone.  Conclusions:   TGF-β signaling resulting in activation of SMAD2 in prostate cancer may be an indicator of cellular stress in the presence of toxic paracrine factors released from the bone marrow stroma, ultimately fostering prostate cancer colonization of bone.""","""['Fayth L Miles', 'Senem Kurtoglu', 'Chris Ahmer', 'Mehrnoosh Soori', 'John S Favate', 'Robert A Sikes']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Role of ALK5/Smad2/3 and MEK1/ERK Signaling in Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1-modulated Growth, Collagen Turnover, and Differentiation of Stem Cells from Apical Papilla of Human Tooth.', 'Increased TGF-β1-mediated suppression of growth and motility in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells is consistent with Smad2/3 signaling.', 'Transforming growth factor beta receptor I kinase inhibitor down-regulates cytokine secretion and multiple myeloma cell growth in the bone marrow microenvironment.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta1 and prostate cancer.', 'TGF-betal/Smad signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine Differentiation of Prostate Cancer-An Intriguing Example of Tumor Evolution at Play.', 'Downregulation of miR143/145 gene cluster expression promotes the aortic media degeneration process via the TGF-β1 signaling pathway.', 'Fluoride Regulate Osteoblastic Transforming Growth Factor-β1 Signaling by Mediating Recycling of the Type I Receptor ALK5.', 'Synergistic immunologic targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

Results were compared to tumor phenotype, biochemical recurrence and molecular subtypes defined by ERG status as well as genomic deletions of 3p, 5q, 6q and PTEN. EZH2 immunostaining was detectable in 56.6% of 10168 interpretable cancers and considered strong in 1.1%, moderate in 12.2% and weak in 43.3% of cases. High EZH2 expression was strongly associated with high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage (P < 0.0001), positive nodal status (P < 0.0001), elevated preoperative PSA level (P = 0.0066), early PSA recurrence (P < 0.0001) and increased cell proliferation P < 0.0001). High-level EZH2 staining was also associated with TMPRSS2:ERG rearrangement and ERG expression in prostate cancers (P < 0.0001) and was linked to deletions of PTEN, 6q15, 5q21 and 3p13 (P < 0.0001 each) particularly in ERG-negative cancers. The prognostic impact of EZH2 was independent of established pre- and postoperatively assessed clinicopathological parameters.

Serial in vivo volumetric imaging expands the scope and accuracy of experimental investigations of models of normal prostate physiology, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, which are otherwise limited by the anatomy of the mouse prostate. Moreover, accurate imaging of hyperplastic and tumorigenic prostates is now recognized as essential to rigorous pre-clinical trials of new therapies. Bioluminescent imaging has been widely used to determine prostate tumor size, but is semi-quantitative at best. Magnetic resonance imaging can determine prostate volume very accurately, but is expensive and has low throughput. We therefore sought to develop and implement a high throughput, low cost, and accurate serial imaging protocol for the mouse prostate.  Methods:   We developed a high frequency ultrasound imaging technique employing 3D reconstruction that allows rapid and precise assessment of mouse prostate volume. Wild-type mouse prostates were examined (n = 4) for reproducible baseline imaging, and treatment effects on volume were compared, and blinded data analyzed for intra- and inter-operator assessments of reproducibility by correlation and for Bland-Altman analysis. Examples of benign prostatic hyperplasia mouse model prostate (n = 2) and mouse prostate implantation of orthotopic human prostate cancer tumor and its growth (n = ) are also demonstrated.  Results:   Serial measurement volume of the mouse prostate revealed that high frequency ultrasound was very precise. Following endocrine manipulation, regression and regrowth of the prostate could be monitored with very low intra- and interobserver variability. This technique was also valuable to monitor the development of prostate growth in a model of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, we demonstrate accurate ultrasound image-guided implantation of orthotopic tumor xenografts and monitoring of subsequent tumor growth from ~10 to ~750 mm(3) volume.  Discussion:   High frequency ultrasound imaging allows precise determination of normal, neoplastic and hyperplastic mouse prostate. Low cost and small image size allows incorporation of this imaging modality inside clean animal facilities, and thereby imaging of immunocompromised models. 3D reconstruction for volume determination is easily mastered, and both small and large relative changes in volume are accurately visualized. Ultrasound imaging does not rely on penetration of exogenous imaging agents, and so may therefore better measure poorly vascularized or necrotic diseased tissue, relative to bioluminescent imaging (IVIS).  Conclusions:   Our method is precise and reproducible with very low inter- and intra-observer variability. Because it is non-invasive, mouse models of prostatic disease states can be imaged serially, reducing inter-animal variability, and enhancing the power to detect small volume changes following therapeutic intervention.""","""['Shalini Singh', 'Chunliu Pan', 'Ronald Wood', 'Chiuan-Ren Yeh', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Kai Sha', 'John J Krolewski', 'Kent L Nastiuk']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['A new three-dimensional ultrasound microimaging technology for preclinical studies using a transgenic prostate cancer mouse model.', 'Three-dimensional registration of prostate images from histology and ultrasound.', 'Accuracy of prostate volume measurements in vitro using three-dimensional ultrasound.', 'Newer modalities of ultrasound imaging and treatment of the prostate.', 'Advances in the studies of morphological histology and imaging of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Rate of castration-induced prostate stroma regression is reduced in a mouse model of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'TNF Signaling Is Required for Castration-Induced Vascular Damage Preceding Prostate Cancer Regression.', 'TNF is a potential therapeutic target to suppress prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia in autoimmune disease.', 'Is Hypoxia a Factor Influencing PSMA-Directed Radioligand Therapy?-An In Silico Study on the Role of Chronic Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate tumor-derived GDF11 accelerates androgen deprivation therapy-induced sarcopenia.']"""

Of note, it has been recently shown that conditional stk11 knockout mice develop atypical hyperplasia and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We recently reported an inverse correlation between the activity of the STK11/AMPK pathway and the MAPK/p38 cascade in HIF1A-dependent malignancies. Furthermore, MAPK/p38 overactivation was detected in benign prostate hyperplasia, PIN and PCa in mice and humans. Here we report that STK11 expression is significantly decreased in PCa compared to normal tissues. Moreover, STK11 protein levels decreased throughout prostate carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the role of STK11-MAPK/p38 activity balance in PCa, we treated PCa cell lines and primary biopsies with a well-established MAPK14-MAPK11 inhibitor (SB202190), which has been extensively used in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that inhibition of MAPK/p38 significantly affects PCa cell survival in an STK11-dependent manner. Indeed, we found that pharmacologic inactivation of MAPK/p38 does not affect viability of STK11-proficient PCa cells due to the triggering of the AMPK-dependent autophagic pathway, while it induces apoptosis in STK11-deficient cells irrespective of androgen receptor (AR) status. Of note, AMPK inactivation or autophagy inhibition in STK11-proficient cells sensitize SB202190-treated PCa cells to apoptosis. On the other end, reconstitution of functional STK11 in STK11-deficient PCa cells abrogates apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that STK11 is a key factor involved in the early phases of prostate carcinogenesis, and suggest that it might be used as a predictive marker of therapeutic response to MAPK/p38 inhibitors in PCa patients.""","""['Valentina Grossi', 'Giuseppe Lucarelli', 'Giovanna Forte', 'Alessia Peserico', 'Antonio Matrone', 'Aldo Germani', 'Monica Rutigliano', 'Alessandro Stella', 'Rosanna Bagnulo', 'Daria Loconte', 'Vanessa Galleggiante', 'Francesca Sanguedolce', 'Simona Cagiano', 'Pantaleo Bufo', 'Senia Trabucco', 'Eugenio Maiorano', 'Pasquale Ditonno', 'Michele Battaglia', 'Nicoletta Resta', 'Cristiano Simone']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['ADIPOQ/adiponectin induces cytotoxic autophagy in breast cancer cells through STK11/LKB1-mediated activation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis.', 'p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, ERCC1 expression, and viability of lung cancer cells from never or light smoker patients.', 'Apoptotic effect of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid on human gastric carcinoma cells involving JNK/p38 MAPK signaling activation.', 'Loss of function STK11 alterations and poor outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer: Literature and case series of US Veterans.', 'The Secret Life of Translation Initiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Autophagy: A challengeable paradox in cancer treatment.', 'Recent advances in the molecular targeted drugs for prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer.""]"""

Materials and methods:   We studied 14,902 patients with prostate cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in 2010-2011 treated with prostatectomy. Patients were categorized by National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical risk groups, separating low-risk patients by percent positive biopsy cores (PBC). We measured incidence of pathologic high-risk disease, defined as pT3a-T4 or Gleason 8-10, and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine if patients with clinical low-risk disease and ≥50% PBC were similar to other low- or intermediate-risk patients. This analysis was repeated with favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk.  Results:   At prostatectomy, 9.2% of clinically low-risk patients with <50% PBC, 18.6% of clinically low-risk patients with ≥50% PBC, and 27.6% of clinically intermediate-risk patients had occult, high-risk disease (P <.001). On multivariable logistic regression, low-risk patients with ≥50% PBC were more likely than low-risk patients with <50% PBC to have pathologic high-risk disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.90-2.73, P <.001), had similar risk to favorable intermediate patients overall (AOR 1.09, 0.91-1.31, P = .33), and had higher risk than favorable intermediate patients aged over 60 years (AOR 1.28, 1.00-1.64, P = .04). Low-risk patients with ≥50% PBC had a mean tumor size similar to unfavorable intermediate-risk patients (21.3 vs 21.0 mm, P = .82).

However, its interpretation is a time consuming and complex feat requiring dedicated radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools could allow better integration of data deriving from the different MRI sequences in order to obtain accurate, reproducible, non-operator dependent information useful to identify and stage PCa. In this paper, we present a fully automatic CAD system conceived as a 2-stage process. First, a malignancy probability map for all voxels within the prostate is created. Then, a candidate segmentation step is performed to highlight suspected areas, thus evaluating both the sensitivity and the number of false positive (FP) regions detected by the system. Training and testing of the CAD scheme is performed using whole-mount histological sections as the reference standard. On a cohort of 56 patients (i.e. 65 lesions) the area under the ROC curve obtained during the voxel-wise step was 0.91, while, in the second step, a per-patient sensitivity of 97% was reached, with a median number of FP equal to 3 in the whole prostate. The system here proposed could be potentially used as first or second reader to manage patients suspected to have PCa, thus reducing both the radiologist's reporting time and the inter-reader variability. As an innovative setup, it could also be used to help the radiologist in setting the MRI-guided biopsy target.""","""['Valentina Giannini', 'Simone Mazzetti', 'Anna Vignati', 'Filippo Russo', 'Enrico Bollito', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Michele Stasi', 'Daniele Regge']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection using T2-weighted and high-b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'Multiparametric MRI and Radiomics in Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Literature.', 'A Fully Automatic Artificial Intelligence System Able to Detect and Characterize Prostate Cancer Using Multiparametric MRI: Multicenter and Multi-Scanner Validation.', 'Harnessing clinical annotations to improve deep learning performance in prostate segmentation.', 'Computer-Aided Diagnosis Improves the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric-MRI: A Multi-Observer Performance Study Involving Inexperienced Readers.']"""

The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of (11) C-Choline PET/CT and the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient maps (ADC) in detecting the Index Lesion and clinically significant tumors in PPC.  Methods:   Twenty-one untreated patients with biopsy-proven PPC and candidates for radical prostatectomy (RP) were prospectively evaluated by means of Ultra-High Definition PET/CT and 3T MRI, which included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and ADC maps obtained from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Independent experts analyzed all the images separately and were unaware of the pathological data. In each case, the Index lesion was defined as the largest tumor measured on histopathology (Index H). In addition, the largest lesion observed on MRI (Index MRI) and the highest avid (11) C-Choline uptake lesion (Index PET) were obtained. The Gleason scores (GS) of the tumors were determined. PET/CT and ADC map quantitative parameters were also calculated. Measures of correlation among imaging parameters as well as the sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp), negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) for tumor detection were analyzed. All data was validated with the pathological study.  Results:   In the morphological study, 139 foci of carcinoma were identified, 47 of which corresponded to clinically significant tumors (>0.5 cm(3)). The remaining foci presented a maximum diameter (dmax ) of 0.1 cm ± SD 0.75 and were not classified as clinically significant. Thirty-two tumors presented a GS (3 + 3), nine GS (3 + 4), and six GS (4 + 3). A total of 21 Index H (dmax = 1.37 cm SD ± 0.61) were identified. The S, Sp, NPV, and PPV for tumor detection with PET were 100%, 70%, 83%, 100%, and for MRI were 46%, 100%, 100%, 54%, respectively. Both Index PET and Index MRI were complementary and identified 95% of the Index H when quantitative criteria were used.

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of two different populations of EVs (microvesicle- and exosome-enriched) as carriers of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   EVs were isolated from LNCaP- and PC-3 prostate cancer cell cultures using differential centrifugation and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot. The uptake of microvesicles and exosomes by the autologous prostate cancer cells was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The EVs were loaded with Paclitaxel and the effectiveness of EV-mediated drug delivery was assessed with viability assays. The distribution of EVs and EV-delivered Paclitaxel in cells was inspected by confocal microscopy.  Results:   Our main finding was that the loading of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cell-derived EVs increased its cytotoxic effect. This capacity was independent of the EV population and the cell line tested. Although the EVs without the drug increased cancer cell viability, the net effect of enhanced cytotoxicity remained. Both EV populations delivered Paclitaxel to the recipient cells through endocytosis, leading to the release of the drug from within the cells. The removal of EV surface proteins did not affect exosomes, while the drug delivery mediated by microvesicles was partially inhibited.  Conclusions:   Cancer cell-derived EVs can be used as effective carriers of Paclitaxel to their parental cells, bringing the drug into the cells through an endocytic pathway and increasing its cytotoxicity.

A characteristic feature of prostate cancer is a dramatic increase in the inhibitory capacity of prostate secretion. It was found that in BPH patients, expression of B1 receptors in the prostate tissue is completely absent. The specific response with anti-B1 antibodies in the glandular epithelium was observed in malignant foci acini and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In contrast, expression of the B2 receptors occurs in the stroma of both BPH and prostate cancer independent of stage and Gleason score. Indicators of kallikrein and ACE activity in prostate secretion and expression of the B1 receptors in prostate tissue may be utilized for prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['M I Kogan', 'E A Chernogubova', 'M B Chibichjan', 'A Je Macionis', 'P Je Povilajtite', 'D G Matishov']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Evidence for activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the human prostate: increased angiotensin II and reduced AT(1) receptor expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems in the kidney of an African lungfish, Protopterus annectens.', 'The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin ii receptors of the second type in the pathogenesis of proliferative diseases of the prostate.', 'Different cross-talk sites between the renin-angiotensin and the kallikrein-kinin systems.', 'Novel anti-thrombotic mechanisms mediated by Mas receptor as result of balanced activities between the kallikrein/kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems.']"""

Currently, more attention is paid to the quality of life, because even minor changes in the quality of life can lead to serious alterations in the psycho-emotional status and significantly reduce patients' self-esteem. Most experts believe that the quality of life of patients treated for prostate cancer, is mostly affected by urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, and bowel dysfunction. Thanks to advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, the incidence of complications was reduced to a minimum. To some extent, this was due to the use of novel minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer, such as cryoablation, interstitial brachytherapy and HIFU-therapy. The quality of life in 65 patients undergoing cryoablation of the prostate was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.

Nonenzymatic glyco-oxidation of proteins under oxidative stress has been associated with carcinogenesis through advanced glycation end products (AGE)-receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) axis. Modified proteins that are immunogenic and stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses are being studied to develop early detection markers of cancer. This study has probed the structural alternations; leading to the formation of adducts and aggregates, in histone H2A upon in vitro modification by methylglyoxal (MG). The immunogenicity of modified histone H2A and its binding with cancer autoantibodies was also assessed. MG induced lysine side chain modifications, blocking of free amino groups and the formation of condensed cross structures in histone H2A; and its effect was inhibited by carbonyl scavengers. It led to the adduct formation and generation of N-epsilon-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) and its decomposition forms as revealed by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography and LC-MS. MG-H2A showed amorphous aggregate formation under electron microscopy and altered binding with DNA in circular dichroism studies. The modified histone elicited high titer immunogen-specific antibodies in rabbits when compared with the native, thus pointing toward the generation of neo-epitopes in MG-H2A. The autoantibodies derived from cancer patients exhibited enhanced binding with MG-H2A as compared with the native histone in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel retardation assay. This reflects sharing of epitopes on MG-H2A and histones in cancer patients. The neo-epitopes on H2A may be responsible for induction and elevated levels of antibodies in cancer patients. Thus, MG-H2A may be considered as potential antigenic candidate for auto-immune response in cancer.""","""['Abdul Rouf Mir', 'Moinuddin', 'Safia Habib', 'Farzana Khan', 'Khursheed Alam', 'Asif Ali']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Glycobiology""","""['Circulating autoantibodies in cancer patients have high specificity for glycoxidation modified histone H2A.', 'Dicarbonyl Induced Structural Perturbations Make Histone H1 Highly Immunogenic and Generate an Auto-Immune Response in Cancer.', 'Neo-epitopes on methylglyoxal modified human serum albumin lead to aggressive autoimmune response in diabetes.', ""Detection of oxidized and glycated proteins in clinical samples using mass spectrometry--a user's perspective."", 'Advanced glycation endproducts in food and their effects on health.', 'Methylglyoxal and Its Adducts: Induction, Repair, and Association with Disease.', 'Covalent Histone Modification by an Electrophilic Derivative of the Anti-HIV Drug Nevirapine.', 'CD44, a Predominant Protein in Methylglyoxal-Induced Secretome of Muscle Cells, is Elevated in Diabetic Plasma.', 'RAGE and Its Ligands: Molecular Interplay Between Glycation, Inflammation, and Hallmarks of Cancer-a Review.', 'Probing Protein Glycation by Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry: Analysis of Glycation Adducts.']"""

The antitumor activity of GC was compared with trans-resveratrol (tRV), a stilbenoid polyphenol. Our results show that MSE and GC at clinically achievable concentrations significantly inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic, prostate, breast, and colon cancer cell types (P < 0.05), without affecting normal cells. Interestingly, GC exerts enhanced antitumor activity than that of tRV (P < 0.05). MSE and GC significantly induced apoptosis in all the cancer cells, indicating MSE and GC inhibit tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis (P < 0.001). Our findings provide evidence that MSE might induce apoptosis in cancer cells via caspase-3/7-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, GC might trigger both early and late stage apoptosis in cancer cells, at least in part by activating caspase 3/7-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, the antitumor efficacy of MSE observed in vitro was also validated in a widely used colon-26 tumor-bearing mouse model.

Various detection technologies involving quantitative analyzing devices have been reported to have sufficient analytical sensitivity and quantification capability for clinical point-of-care tests. Fluorescence-based detection technologies such as quantum dots, Eu(III) nanoparticles, and photon-upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been introduced as promising solutions for point-of-care devices because of their high detectability by optical sensors. Lateral flow assays can be used for various sample types, e.g., urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. This study focuses on the properties of serum and plasma because of their relevance in cancer and AMI diagnostics. The limit of detection was compared in LF assays having Eu(III) nanoparticles or UCNPs as reporters and the antibody configurations for two different analytes (prostate-specific antigen and cardiac troponin I (cTnI)). The results indicate a significant effect of anticoagulants in venipuncture tubes. The samples in K3EDTA tubes resulted in significant interference by decreased reporter particle mobility, and thus the limit of detection was up to eightfold less sensitive compared to serum samples.

We have recently identified somatic hotspot mutations in RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in half of ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, a rare class of sex-cord stromal cell tumors in young women. These hotspot mutations lost IIIb cleavage activity of DICER1 in vitro and failed to produce 5p-derived miRNAs in mouse Dicer1-null ES cells. However, the oncogenic potential of these hotspot DICER1 mutations has not been studied. Here, we further revealed that the global expression of 5p-derived miRNAs was dramatically reduced in ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors carrying DICER1 hotspot mutations compared with those without DICER1 hotspot mutation. The miRNA production defect was associated with the deregulation of genes controlling cell proliferation and the cell fate. Using an immortalized human granulosa cell line, SVOG3e, we determined that the D1709N-DICER1 hotspot mutation failed to produce 5p-derived miRNAs, deregulated the expression of several genes that control gonadal differentiation and cell proliferation, and promoted cell growth. Re-expression of let-7 significantly inhibited the growth of D1709N-DICER1 SVOG3e cells, accompanied by the suppression of key regulators of cell cycle control and ovarian gonad differentiation. Taken together, our data revealed that DICER1 hotspot mutations cause systemic loss of 5p-miRNAs that can both drive pseudodifferentiation of testicular elements and cause oncogenic transformation in the ovary.""","""['Yemin Wang', 'Jiamin Chen', 'Winnie Yang', 'Fan Mo', 'Janine Senz', 'Damian Yap', 'Michael S Anglesio', 'Blake Gilks', 'Gregg B Morin', 'David G Huntsman']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Recurrent DICER1 hotspot mutations in endometrial tumours and their impact on microRNA biogenesis.', 'Recurrent somatic DICER1 mutations in nonepithelial ovarian cancers.', 'Cancer-associated somatic DICER1 hotspot mutations cause defective miRNA processing and reverse-strand expression bias to predominantly mature 3p strands through loss of 5p strand cleavage.', 'The co-occurrence of an ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor with a thyroid carcinoma is highly suggestive of a DICER1 syndrome.', 'Gynecologic Manifestations of the DICER1 Syndrome.', 'DICER1 RNase IIIb domain mutations trigger widespread miRNA dysregulation and MAPK activation in pediatric thyroid cancer.', 'Mechanisms Controlling MicroRNA Expression in Tumor.', 'Tumor Suppressor miRNA in Cancer Cells and the Tumor Microenvironment: Mechanism of Deregulation and Clinical Implications.', '(In)Distinctive Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Common and Rare Ovarian Cancers.', 'DICER1 tumor predisposition syndrome: an evolving story initiated with the pleuropulmonary blastoma.']"""

The advent of positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging enhanced with fluorocholine has led to the identification of a new sub-group of metastatic prostate cancer patients: those with so-called oligometastatic disease. Presenting with a low burden of metastatic disease (≤5 lesions), this new sub-group lies between true metastatic prostate cancer patients for whom androgen- deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment, and patients with a rising PSA, but no visible lesion on conventional imaging, in whom intermittent ADT has been shown to be no less effective than continuous ADT. One might conclude that intermittent ADT would also be the standard of care for oligometastatic prostate cancer patients, but radical strategies such as extensive lymphadenectomy or high-dose radiotherapy have been suggested as another means to delay the need for ADT, and increase its effectiveness once initiated. This study will explore the role of salvage pelvic image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with ADT administered for 6 months in pelvic oligometastatic patients in prolonging the failure-free interval between two consecutive ADT courses, or even to cure selected patients with limited metastatic burden.  Methods/design:   We plan to assess the two year outcome in oligometastatic prostate cancer patients (1-5 pelvic oligometastases) treated concomitantly with high-dose IMRT (54 Gy, 30 fractions to the pelvis and 66 Gy, 30 fractions to the lymph nodes) and ADT for six months.  Discussion:   This multicenter prospective phase II study will yield new data regarding the safety and efficacy of high-dose radiotherapy combined with ADT and will provide a basis for a larger phase III study to examine the role of radiotherapy in this population currently treated only with hormone therapy.

Methods:   Calcium intake at diagnosis was assessed, and 65 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CASR were genotyped in 886 prostatectomy patients. We investigated the association between calcium intake and CASR variants with both PCa recurrence and aggressiveness (defined as Gleason score ≥4 + 3, stage ≥pT3, or nodal-positive disease).  Results:   A total of 285 men had aggressive disease and 91 experienced recurrence. A U-shaped relationship between calcium intake and both disease recurrence and aggressiveness was observed. Compared to the middle quintile, the HR for disease recurrence was 3.07 (95% CI 1.41-6.69) for the lowest quintile and 3.21 (95% CI 1.47-7.00) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.37-6.45) for the two upper quintiles, respectively.

The aim was to assess the predictive role of imaging parameters derived by (11)C-choline PET/CT on survival outcomes-overall survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS), and biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS)-in patients treated with helical tomotherapy (HTT) for LN recurrence.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 68 patients affected by PCa (mean age, 68 y; age range, 51-81 y) with biochemical recurrence after primary treatment (median prostate-specific antigen values obtained at the time of PET/CT scan, 2.42 ng/mL; range, 0.61-27.56 ng/mL) who underwent (11)C-choline PET/CT from January 2005 to January 2013 and were treated with HTT in correspondence of the pathologic choline LN uptake. PET-derived parameters, including maximum/mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) with a threshold of 40%, 50%, and 60% were calculated. The best cutoff values of PET-derived parameters discriminating between patients with and without relapse, after treatment guided by PET, were assessed by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis including the most predictive PET-derived parameters and survival outcomes were performed.  Results:   The median follow-up was 20 mo (mean, 26 mo; range, 3-97 mo). (11)C-choline PET/CT showed pathologic LN uptake in 4 patients at the pelvic level, in 5 at the abdominal level, in 13 at both the pelvic and the abdominal level, and in 46 at the abdominal or pelvic or other sites. The 2-y overall survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, cRFS, and bRFS were 87%, 91%, 51%, and 40%, respectively. On the basis of ROC curves, the most discriminative cutoff value for MTV values was an MTV threshold of 60% (MTV60) of greater than 0.64 cm(3). No significant cutoff values were found for SUVmax or SUVmean at univariate analysis, whereas MTV60 was confirmed as an independent predictor in multivariate analysis and significantly correlated with bRFS and cRFS. MTV60 and extrapelvic disease well predict the risk of cRFS.  Conclusion:   (11)C-choline PET/CT performed as a guide for HTT on LN recurrence is predictive of survival. In particular, MTV60 and extrapelvic disease were the best predictors of tumor response for bRFS and cRFS in PCa patients with LN recurrence after primary treatment.

Methods:   We evaluated the association of six biomarkers [Periostin, (-5, -7) proPSA, CACNA1D, HER2/neu, EZH2, and Ki-67] with different Gleason scores and biochemical recurrence (BCR) on prostate cancer TMAs of 80 radical prostatectomy (RP) cases. Multiplex tissue immunoblotting (MTI) was used to assess these biomarkers in cancer and adjacent benign areas of 5 μm sections. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) was applied to model our results.  Results:   In the RP cases, CACNA1D, HER2/neu, and Periostin expression were significantly correlated with aggressive phenotype in cancer areas. An MLR model in the cancer area yielded a ROC-AUC = 0.98, whereas in cancer-adjacent benign areas, yielded a ROC-AUC = 0.94. CACNA1D and HER2/neu expression combined with Gleason score in a MLR model yielded a ROC-AUC = 0.79 for BCR prediction. In the small biopsies from an AS cohort of 61 VLR cases, an MLR model for prediction of progressors at diagnosis retained (-5, -7) proPSA and CACNA1D, yielding a ROC-AUC of 0.78, which was improved to 0.82 after adding tPSA into the model.  Conclusions:   The molecular profile of biomarkers is capable of accurately predicting aggressive prostate cancer on retrospective RP cases and identifying potential aggressive prostate cancer requiring immediate treatment on the AS diagnostic biopsy but limited in BCR prediction.

Peer support conventionally includes empathetic interaction between people with shared experiences. This unique study considers how to authentically communicate peer empathy in a one-way film narrative.  Methods:   We co-created a film based on phenomenological interviews with seven men who had volunteered to support other men by sharing their experiences of coping with prostate cancer. The film contributed to successful engagement with self-management. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of the interview data was conducted to explore the components of experiential empathy that the men had communicated.  Results:   Four themes were identified illustrating what men wanted other men to know about coping with prostate cancer: Going into the unknown, it was difficult but I got through highlighted trauma and the importance of having a determined attitude; Only you can do it illustrated the triumph of their journey and of regaining control; I haven't changed massively reflected the importance of a constant self; and Stay involved represented the overriding need to remain part of pre-cancer social environments.  Conclusions:   We propose a construct framework of experiential empathy for men with prostate cancer: Resilience, Regaining Control, Continuity-of-Self, and Social Connectedness. Filmed peer support that communicates these constructs will offer wide-ranging benefit to meet the needs of this group of men in both e-health and face-to-face self-management contexts.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second-leading cause of death in males in the Western population. There is a presently unmet need for accurate diagnostic tool to localize and define the extent of both primary PCa and occult recurrent disease. One of the most suitable targets for PCa is the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) recognised by the monoclonal antibody D2B that we re-shaped into the single chain Fv (scFv format). Aim of this study was to evaluate in preclinical in vivo models the target specificity of scFvD2B after labelling with different radionuclides. (111)In radiolabelling was performed via the chelator Bz-NOTA, and (131)I radioiodination was performed using iodogen. The potential for molecular imaging and the biological behaviour of the radiolabelled scFvD2B were evaluated in mice bearing two subcutaneous PCa isogenic cell lines that differed only in PSMA expression. Biodistribution studies were performed at 3, 9, 15 and 24h after injection to determine the optimal imaging time point. A significant kidney accumulation, as percentage of injected dose of tissue (%ID/g), was observed for (111)In-scFvD2B at 3h after injection (45%ID/g) and it was maintained up to 24h (26%ID/g). By contrast, kidney accumulation of (131)I-scFvD2B was only marginally (0.3%ID/g at 24h). At the optimal time point defined between 15h and 24h, regardless of the radionuclide used, the scFvD2B was able to localize significantly better in the PSMA expressing tumours compared to the negative control; with (131)I-scFvD2B yielding a significantly better target/background ratio compared to (111)In-scFvD2B.

Here we report that 5-hmC is an epigenetic hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. A member of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins, which catalyse the oxidation of methylated cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC, TET2, is repressed by androgens in PCa. Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated induction of the miR-29 family, which targets TET2, are markedly enhanced in hormone refractory PCa (HRPC) and its high expression predicts poor outcome of PCa patients. Furthermore, decreased expression of miR-29b results in reduced tumour growth and increased TET2 expression in an animal model of HRPC. Interestingly, global 5-hmC modification regulated by miR-29b represses FOXA1 activity. A reduction in 5-hmC activates PCa-related key pathways such as mTOR and AR. Thus, DNA modification directly links the TET2-dependent epigenetic pathway regulated by AR to 5-hmC-mediated tumour progression.""","""['Ken-ichi Takayama', 'Aya Misawa', 'Takashi Suzuki', 'Kiyoshi Takagi', 'Yoshihide Hayashizaki', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Yukio Homma', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Tomohiko Urano', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Corrigendum: TET2 repression by androgen hormone regulates global hydroxymethylation status and prostate cancer progression.', 'TET family proteins and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'TET2-mediated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine induces genetic instability and mutagenesis.', 'Ascorbate induces ten-eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenase-mediated generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.', 'Ten-eleven translocation proteins (TETs): tumor suppressors or tumor enhancers?', 'The TET2 interactors and their links to hematological malignancies.', 'Reprogramming of ovarian aging epigenome by resveratrol.', 'Extensive androgen receptor enhancer heterogeneity in primary prostate cancers underlies transcriptional diversity and metastatic potential.', 'Targeting phase separation on enhancers induced by transcription factor complex formations as a new strategy for treating drug-resistant cancers.', 'Correlation of TET-2 Levels with Disease Evaluation in AMI Patients.', 'OCT1-target neural gene PFN2 promotes tumor growth in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.']"""

Alternative splicing of the OPN primary transcript generates three splicing isoforms, OPNa, OPNb and OPNc. In this report, we investigated some cellular mechanisms by which OPN splice variants could mediate PC3 prostate cancer (PCa) cell survival and growth in response to docetaxel (DXT)-induced cell death. Cell survival before and after DXT treatment was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy and crystal-violet staining assays. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemical staining assays were used to evaluate the putative involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and OPN isoforms on mediating PC3 cell survival. Upon DXT treatment, PC3 cells overexpressing OPNb or OPNc isoforms showed higher cell densities, compared to cells overexpressing OPNa and controls. Notably, cells overexpressing OPNb or OPNc isoforms showed a downregulated pattern of EMT epithelial cell markers, while mesenchymal markers were mostly upregulated in these experimental conditions. We concluded that OPNc or OPNb overexpression in PC3 cells can mediate resistance and cell survival features in response to DXT-induced cell death. Our data also provide evidence the EMT program could be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating survival in OPNb- or OPNc-overexpressing cells in response to DXT treatment.

The stably transfected cells were examined for cell apoptosis and cell clone formation capacity with flow cytometry and colony formation assay.  Results:   DNA sequencing demonstrated successful construction of the 3 FoxM1 shRNA lentivirus vectors. Real-time PCR showed a high interference efficiency of FoxM1 shRNA1 vector, which resulted in obvious down-regulation of FoxM1 in DU-145 cells. Western blotting showed that the expression of FoxM1 protein was decreased in FoxM1 shRNA1 lentivirus-transfected cells, which displayed a suppressed cell proliferation, increased apoptosis rate, and attenuated clonogenic ability.

Methods:   A cross-sectional study was performed among 999 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2009. All patients received a questionnaire on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), illness perception (B-IPQ) and satisfaction with information provision (EORTC QLQ-INFO-25). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between satisfaction with information provision and HRQoL as well as illness perception.  Results:   Response rate was 70% (N = 697), 34% (N = 222) indicated to be dissatisfied with the information received. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed a significant positive association between satisfaction with information provision and global health (P = <0.001), emotional functioning (P = 0.004), social functioning (P = 0.027), physical functioning (P = 0.002) and role functioning (P = 0.001). Satisfaction was negatively associated with illness perception subscales on consequences (P = 0.020), timeline (P = 0.031), personal control (P = 0.013), treatment control (P < 0.001), illness concern (P < 0.001), coherence (P = 0.001) and emotional representation (P = 0.004). Hence, more satisfied patients reported fewer consequences of disease, illness concern and emotional representation, but higher personal and treatment control and coherence.  Conclusions:   A third of all prostate cancer survivors reported to be dissatisfied with the information received and scored worse on HRQoL and illness perception. A prospective randomized study is needed to study the effect of an intervention that improves information provision on HRQoL and illness perception outcomes.

Sipuleucel-T is prepared individually for each patient and infused in three sessions over a period of 1 month. However, in 2015, Dendreon, the owner of sipuleucel-T, filed for bankruptcy. This opinion paper reviews the probable reasons this innovative product failed to achieve commercial success. PubMed and internet searches were performed focused on pricing, reimbursement, and market access. We found that sipuleucel-T's FDA approval was delayed by 3 years, reportedly because of the vaccine's new mechanism of action. Sipuleucel-T was cleared by the European Medicines Agency 2 years later, but other national agencies were not approached. It was priced at $US93,000 for a course of treatment, and this high price combined with the company's late securement of reimbursement for the vaccine by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) resulted in another year's delay in accessing the market. Despite a positive recommendation by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, sipuleucel-T's complex administration, high price, and uncertainty about the reimbursement status deterred doctors from prescribing the product. Furthermore, the vaccine's supply was limited during the first year of launch due to limited manufacturing capacity. In addition, two oral metastatic prostate cancer drugs with similar survival benefits reached the US market 1 and 2 years after sipuleucel-T. Also, even though Dendreon's market capitalization topped $US7.5 billion following the FDA's approval of sipuleucel-T, this value degraded gradually until the firm's bankruptcy 5 years later. We conclude that the bankruptcy of Dendreon was largely due to the delay in securing FDA approval and CMS coverage, as well as the high cost that had to be incurred by providers up-front. Licensing sipuleucel-T to a pharmaceutical company more experienced in the market access pathway may have saved the company and the product.""","""['Szymon Jarosławski', 'Mondher Toumi']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""BioDrugs""","""['Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', 'Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PROVENGE (Sipuleucel-T) in prostate cancer: the first FDA-approved therapeutic cancer vaccine.', 'Sipuleucel-T: a vaccine for metastatic, asymptomatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Economic evaluation of sipuleucel-T immunotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hydrogel-guided strategies to stimulate an effective immune response for vaccine-based cancer immunotherapy.', 'Engineering the next generation of cell-based therapeutics.', 'Engineered implantable vaccine platform for continuous antigen-specific immunomodulation.', 'Emerging biomaterial-based strategies for personalized therapeutic in situ cancer vaccines.', 'Current landscape of clinical development and approval of advanced therapies.']"""

We demonstrated that macrophage specific (LyzM-Cre) conditional deletion of HO-1 suppressed growth of PC3 xenografts in vivo and delayed progression of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in TRAMP mice. However, initiation and progression of cancer xenografts in the presence of macrophages lacking HO-1 resulted in loss of E-cadherin, a known marker of poor prognosis as well as EMT. Application of CO, a product of HO-1 catalysis, increased levels of E-cadherin in the adherens junctions between cancer cells. We further showed that HO-1-driven expression of E-cadherin in cancer cells cultured in the presence of macrophages is dependent on mitochondrial activity of cancer cells.In summary, these data suggest that HO-1-derived CO from tumor-associated macrophages influences, in part, E-cadherin expression and thus tumor initiation and progression.""","""['Zsuzsanna Nemeth', 'Mailin Li', 'Eva Csizmadia', 'Balazs Döme', 'Martin Johansson', 'Jenny Liao Persson', 'Pankaj Seth', 'Leo Otterbein', 'Barbara Wegiel']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['PTEN deletion and heme oxygenase-1 overexpression cooperate in prostate cancer progression and are associated with adverse clinical outcome.', 'Critical role of endogenous heme oxygenase 1 as a tuner of the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel experimental heme oxygenase-1-targeted therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'The Diverse Roles of Heme Oxygenase-1 in Tumor Progression.', 'Heme oxygenase-1: emerging target of cancer therapy.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Derivative of Curcumol, HCL-23, Inhibits the Malignant Phenotype of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Induces Apoptosis and HO-1-Dependent Ferroptosis.', 'The promise of targeting heme and mitochondrial respiration in normalizing tumor microenvironment and potentiating immunotherapy.', 'Crosstalk between Heme Oxygenase-1 and Iron Metabolism in Macrophages: Implications for the Modulation of Inflammation and Immunity.', 'Non-canonical vs. Canonical Functions of Heme Oxygenase-1 in Cancer.']"""

A good linear accelerator (linac) source model is critical for both accuracy and efficiency considerations. In principle, an analytical source model should be more preferred for GPU-based MC dose engines than a phase-space file-based model, in that data loading and CPU-GPU data transfer can be avoided. In this paper, we presented an analytical field-independent source model specifically developed for GPU-based MC dose calculations, associated with a GPU-friendly sampling scheme. A key concept called phase-space-ring (PSR) was proposed. Each PSR contained a group of particles that were of the same type, close in energy and reside in a narrow ring on the phase-space plane located just above the upper jaws. The model parameterized the probability densities of particle location, direction and energy for each primary photon PSR, scattered photon PSR and electron PSR. Models of one 2D Gaussian distribution or multiple Gaussian components were employed to represent the particle direction distributions of these PSRs. A method was developed to analyze a reference phase-space file and derive corresponding model parameters. To efficiently use our model in MC dose calculations on GPU, we proposed a GPU-friendly sampling strategy, which ensured that the particles sampled and transported simultaneously are of the same type and close in energy to alleviate GPU thread divergences. To test the accuracy of our model, dose distributions of a set of open fields in a water phantom were calculated using our source model and compared to those calculated using the reference phase-space files. For the high dose gradient regions, the average distance-to-agreement (DTA) was within 1 mm and the maximum DTA within 2 mm. For relatively low dose gradient regions, the root-mean-square (RMS) dose difference was within 1.1% and the maximum dose difference within 1.7%. The maximum relative difference of output factors was within 0.5%. Over 98.5% passing rate was achieved in 3D gamma-index tests with 2%/2 mm criteria in both an IMRT prostate patient case and a head-and-neck case. These results demonstrated the efficacy of our model in terms of accurately representing a reference phase-space file. We have also tested the efficiency gain of our source model over our previously developed phase-space-let file source model. The overall efficiency of dose calculation was found to be improved by ~1.3-2.2 times in water and patient cases using our analytical model.""","""['Zhen Tian', 'Yongbao Li', 'Michael Folkerts', 'Feng Shi', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Moving GPU-OpenCL-based Monte Carlo dose calculation toward clinical use: Automatic beam commissioning and source sampling for treatment plan dose calculation.', 'Automatic commissioning of a GPU-based Monte Carlo radiation dose calculation code for photon radiotherapy.', 'ARCHERRT - a GPU-based and photon-electron coupled Monte Carlo dose computing engine for radiation therapy: software development and application to helical tomotherapy.', 'A GPU OpenCL based cross-platform Monte Carlo dose calculation engine (goMC).', 'GPU-based Monte Carlo radiotherapy dose calculation using phase-space sources.', 'The effect of density overrides on magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy planning for lung cancer.', 'A fast jaw-tracking model for VMAT and IMRT Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Internal Motion Estimation by Internal-external Motion Modeling for Lung Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Moving GPU-OpenCL-based Monte Carlo dose calculation toward clinical use: Automatic beam commissioning and source sampling for treatment plan dose calculation.']"""

DNase I is a useful biomarker. Previous studies have shown that patients with prostate cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus exhibit reduced DNase I activity, and patients with myocardial infarction exhibit increased DNase I activity. Current methods of measuring DNase I relies either on an immunochemical assay, which requires multiple washing steps, or on a single radial enzyme diffusion assay, which requires a long digestion time and an expensive fluorescence detection system. We have developed a lateral flow immunochemical assay for the measurement of DNase I activity on the test strip. The assay utilized a dually labeled double-stranded DNA as the reporter probe. The biotin-labeled terminal of the probe bound to the streptavidin immobilized on the lateral flow test strip, and the fluorescein-labeled terminal bound to the antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles, resulting in a visible test line. The presence of DNase I would cleave the reporter probe and lead to reduced test line intensity. Using the DNase I test strip, we have successfully measured the DNase I activity and determined the factors that influence the sensitivity and linear dynamic range of the assay. We have also investigated the conditions that inhibited the DNase I activity.

Prostate-specific antigen has, however, insufficient diagnostic specificity. Novel complementary diagnostic approaches are greatly needed. MiRNAs are small regulatory RNAs which play an important role in tumorogenesis and are being investigated as a cancer biomarker. In addition to their intracellular regulatory functions, miRNAs are secreted into the extracellular space and can be found in various body fluids, including urine. The stability of extracellular miRNAs is defined by association with proteins, lipoprotein particles, and membrane vesicles. Among the known forms of miRNA packaging, tumour-derived exosome-enclosed miRNAs is thought to reflect the vital activity of cancer cells. The assessment of the exosomal fraction of urinary miRNA may present a new and highly specific method for prostate cancer diagnostics; however, this is challenged by the absence of reliable and inexpensive methods for isolation of exosomes.  Methods:   Prostate cancer (PC) cell lines and urine samples collected from 35 PC patients and 35 healthy donors were used in the study. Lectins, phytohemagglutinin, and concanavalin A were used to induce agglutination of exosomes. The efficiency of isolation process was evaluated by AFM and DLS assays. The protein content of isolated exosomes was analysed by western blotting. Exosomal RNA was assayed by automated electrophoresis and expression level of selected miRNAs was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The diagnostic potency of the urinary exosomal miRNA assessment was estimated by the ROC method.  Results:   The formation of multi-vesicular agglutinates in urine can be induced by incubation with lectin at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. These agglutinates contain urinary exosomes and may be pelleted by centrifugation with a relatively low G-force. The analysis of PC-related miRNA in urinary exosomes revealed significant up-regulation of miR-574-3p, miR-141-5p, and miR-21-5p associated with PC.  Conclusions:   Lectin-induced aggregation is a low-cost and easily performed method for isolation of exosomes from urine. Isolated exosomes can be further analysed in terms of miRNA content. The miRNA profile of urinary exosomes reflects development of prostate cancer and may present a promising diagnostic tool.""","""['Roman Samsonov', 'Tatiana Shtam', 'Vladimir Burdakov', 'Andrey Glotov', 'Evgenia Tsyrlina', 'Lev Berstein', 'Alexander Nosov', 'Vladimir Evtushenko', 'Michael Filatov', 'Anastasia Malek']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Identification of non-invasive miRNAs biomarkers for prostate cancer by deep sequencing analysis of urinary exosomes.', 'Exosomal and Non-Exosomal Urinary miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis.', 'MiR-145 detection in urinary extracellular vesicles increase diagnostic efficiency of prostate cancer based on hydrostatic filtration dialysis method.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in cancer: Potential biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets for immune checkpoint molecules.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming in cancer: From diagnosis to treatment.', 'Urinary extracellular vesicles miRNA-A new era of prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'MiR-375 and miR-21 as Potential Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Matching Samples of Plasma and Exosomes.']"""

Materials and methods:   A prospectively maintained database was used to identify patients on active surveillance between 1998 and 2013. Tumor volume was assessed based on the number of positive cores and proportion of core involvement. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis as appropriate. The primary end point was the development of grade reclassification, defined as grade only and/or grade and volume at the event biopsy.  Results:   A total of 555 men met the study inclusion criteria. Mean followup was 46 months. Overall 70 patients demonstrated an increase in tumor volume at or after biopsy 2. Compared to those men never experiencing volume or grade reclassification, prostate specific antigen at diagnosis was not significantly different (p=0.95), but median prostate volume was smaller in patients who demonstrated volume reclassification (p <0.001). The incidence of pure volume reclassification was 6.8%, 6.1% and 7.8% at biopsy 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Men with volume reclassification were more likely to experience later grade reclassification than those without at 33.3% vs 9.3%, respectively (p <0.0001).  Conclusions:   While Gleason 6 prostate cancer has a favorable natural history, it appears that patients on active surveillance who experience volume reclassification are at substantially higher risk for grade reclassification.

IL-24 is reported to be expressed in a series of cell lines, including keratinocytes as well as breast, lung and prostate cancer cells, but was primarily found in a human melanoma cell line. IL-24 is suggested to have many biological properties displaying anti-tumour effects via induction of apoptosis, suppressing proliferation, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. IL-24 has also been reported to inhibit the migration of cancer cells and keratinocytes, and have anti-angiogeneic properties. The biological functions of IL-24 are regulated through both autocrine and paracrine methods. However, currently there exists little knowledge regarding the effect of IL-24 on endothelial cell biology.  Materials and methods:   The impact of rhIL-24 on human endothelial HECV cell growth, migration, trans-endothelial resistance and angiogenic potential was examined using cellular functional assays. Additionally, the relationship between IL-24 and a number of cell junction proteins were examined using immunofluorescence staining.  Results:   IL-24 and receptor molecules was found to be expressed in HECV endothelial cells. Treatment of this cell line with rhIL-24 was found to promote cell migration rates and suppress tubule formation.  Conclusion:   Treatment of HECV cells with rhIL-24 can promote migration and inhibit tubule formation but does not impact cell growth or permeability at the tested concentrations.

However, under specific conditions, autophagy may, directly or indirectly, induce cell death. In our study, treatment of the Atg5-deficient DU145 prostate cancer cells, with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, induces mitochondrial damage, autophagy and cell death. Molecular inhibition of autophagy by silencing ULK1 and Beclin1 rescues DU145 cells from cell death indicating that, in this setting, autophagy promotes cell death. Re-expression of Atg5 restores the lipidation of LC3 and rescues DU145 and MEF atg5-/- cells from sorafenib-induced cell death. Despite the lack of Atg5 expression and LC3 lipidation, DU145 cells form autophagosomes as demonstrated by transmission and immuno-electron microscopy, and the formation of LC3 positive foci. However, the lack of cellular content in the autophagosomes, the accumulation of long-lived proteins, the presence of GFP-RFP-LC3 positive foci and the accumulated p62 protein levels indicate that these autophagosomes may not be fully functional. DU145 cells treated with sorafenib undergo a caspase-independent cell death that is inhibited by the RIPK1 inhibitor, necrostatin-1. Furthermore, treatment with sorafenib induces the interaction of RIPK1 with p62, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and a proximity ligation assay. Silencing of p62 decreases the RIPK1 protein levels and renders necrostatin-1 ineffective in blocking sorafenib-induced cell death. In summary, the formation of Atg5-deficient autophagosomes in response to sorafenib promotes the interaction of p62 with RIPK leading to cell death by necroptosis.""","""['Pedram Kharaziha', 'Dimitris Chioureas', 'George Baltatzis', 'Pedro Fonseca', 'Patricia Rodriguez', 'Vladimir Gogvadze', 'Lena Lennartsson', 'Ann-Charlotte Björklund', 'Boris Zhivotovsky', 'Dan Grandér', 'Lars Egevad', 'Sten Nilsson', 'Theocharis Panaretakis']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Sorafenib induces autophagic cell death and apoptosis in hepatic stellate cell through the JNK and Akt signaling pathways.', 'Critical contribution of oxidative stress to TNFα-induced necroptosis downstream of RIPK1 activation.', 'Sorafenib induces apoptosis and autophagy in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of Atg5/Atg7-independent alternative autophagy.', 'Necroptosis, necrostatins and tissue injury.', 'Novel Phthalic-Based Anticancer Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: Design, Synthesis and Biological Activity.', 'Rosin Derivative IDOAMP Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth via Activating RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL Signaling Pathway.', 'Necroptosis and Prostate Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Cell Death and the p53 Enigma During Mammalian Embryonic Development.', 'RIPK1-RIPK3 mediates myocardial fibrosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus by impairing autophagic flux of cardiac fibroblasts.']"""

The following parameters were evaluated prior to the first (223)Ra cycle: serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, pain score, use of chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). During/after (223)Ra we evaluated: the total number of radium cycles (RaTot), the PSA doubling time (PSADT), and the use of chemotherapy, EBRT, abiraterone, and enzalutamide.

Mouse double minute (MDM) 2 and MDMX are important players in cancer progression, as they act as regulators of p53, but their function in EMT and metastasis may be contradictory. Here, we show that the EMT phenotype in multiple cellular models and in clinical prostate and breast cancer samples is associated with a decrease in MDM2 and increase in MDMX expression. Modulation of EMT-accompanying changes in MDM2 expression in benign and transformed prostate epithelial cells influences their migration capacity and sensitivity to docetaxel.

Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane glycerophospholipids to release arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids that are implicated in cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of cPLA2α in cell cycle re-entry of quiescent prostate cancer cells. When PC-3 and LNCaP cells were rendered to a quiescent state, the active form of cPLA2α with a phosphorylation at Ser505 was lower compared to their proliferating state. Conversely, the phospho-cPLA2α levels were resurgent during the induction of cell cycle re-entry. Pharmacological inhibition of cPLA2α with Efipladib upon induction of cell cycle re-entry inhibited the re-entry process, as manifested by refrained DNA synthesis, persistent high proportion of cells in G0/G1 and low percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases, together with a stagnant recovery of Ki-67 expression. Simultaneously, Efipladib prohibited the emergence of Skp2 while maintained p27 at a high level in the nuclear compartment during cell cycle re-entry. Inhibition of cPLA2α also prevented an accumulation of cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin E/CDK2, phospho-pRb, pre-replicative complex proteins CDC6, MCM7, ORC6 and DNA synthesis-related protein PCNA during induction of cell cycle re-entry. Moreover, a pre-treatment of the prostate cancer cells with Efipladib during induction of cell cycle re-entry subsequently compromised their tumorigenic capacity in vivo. Hence, cPLA2α plays an important role in cell cycle re-entry by quiescent prostate cancer cells.""","""['Mu Yao', 'Chanlu Xie', 'Mei-Yee Kiang', 'Ying Teng', 'David Harman', 'Jessamy Tiffen', 'Qian Wang', 'Paul Sved', 'Shisan Bao', 'Paul Witting', 'Jeff Holst', 'Qihan Dong']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Cytosolic phospholipase A2α sustains pAKT, pERK and AR levels in PTEN-null/mutated prostate cancer cells.', 'Cytosolic phospholipase A2α regulates G1 progression through modulating FOXO1 activity.', 'Guttiferone K impedes cell cycle re-entry of quiescent prostate cancer cells via stabilization of FBXW7 and subsequent c-MYC degradation.', 'AKT and cytosolic phospholipase A2α form a positive loop in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting Cytosolic Phospholipase A2α for Novel Anti-Inflammatory Agents.', 'The Molecular and Cellular Strategies of Glioblastoma and Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells Conferring Radioresistance.', 'Apigenin impedes cell cycle progression at G2 phase in prostate cancer cells.', 'Multifunctionality of prostatic acid phosphatase in prostate cancer pathogenesis.', 'Towards a Framework for Better Understanding of Quiescent Cancer Cells.', 'Safrana l Prevents Prostate Cancer Recurrence by Blocking the Re-activation of Quiescent Cancer Cells via Downregulation of S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein 2.']"""

There are many factors that affect their morbidity and mortality. Some markers have been evaluated to predict disease prognosis. However, a gold standard prognostic biomarker has not yet been found for CRC. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the factors associated with the duration and cost of hospital stay and mortality.  Methods:   Patients who were admitted to the emergency service and general surgery clinic with abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, diminished stool discharge, and ileus were included in this study. Recorded were patient age, gender, comorbid factors, family history, surgical treatment procedure, elective or urgent surgical intervention, bowel cleansing before surgery, pathological stage, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV) and CEA, CA 19.9 and hemoglobin levels.  Results:   The mean patient age was 61.2±12.4 years. The male/female ratio was 0.596(81/136). Emergency surgery was an independent factor increasing the cost and length of hospital stay (p=0.007 and p=0.018). Additionally, patients >65 years of age had increased length of hospital stay and mortality (p=0.008 and p=0.024, respectively). Anemic patients had 50% higher mortality risk compared with patients with normal hemoglobin levels (p=0.030).  Conclusion:   Based on our results, anemic patients in the geriatric population who underwent emergency CRC surgery may have higher costs, longer hospital stay and greater mortality rates than other CRC patients.""","""['Bulent Caglar Bilgin', 'Sahin Kahramanca', 'Tezcan Akin', 'Ismail Emre Gokce', 'Merve Akin', 'Tevfik Kucukpinar']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Aspects of survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark.', 'Emergency surgery for colorectal cancer does not affect nodal harvest comparing elective procedures: a propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Prolonged Postoperative Ileus Significantly Increases the Cost of Inpatient Stay for Patients Undergoing Elective Colorectal Surgery: Results of a Multivariate Analysis of Prospective Data at a Single Institution.', 'The role of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the prediction of length and cost of hospital stay in patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers: A retrospective comparative study.', 'Colorectal cancer outcomes in nonagenarian patients: A case series.']"""

Even though several sophisticated imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and elastosonography (ES) have already been developed for PCa diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging techniques is still controversial to some extent. Therefore, a comprehensive meta-analysis in this study was performed to compare the accuracy of various diagnostic imaging methods for PCa, including 11C-choline PET/CT, 11C-acetate PET/CT, 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, 18F-fluoroglucose PET/CT, transrectal real-time elastosonography (TRTE), and shear-wave elastosonography (SWE). The eligible studies were identified through systematical searching for the literature in electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science. On the basis of the fixed-effects model, the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were calculated to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of 11C-choline PET/CT, 11C-acetate PET/CT, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT, 18F-fluoroglucose (FDG) PET/CT, TRTE, and SWE. All the statistical analyses were conducted with R language Software. The present meta-analysis incorporating a total of 82 studies demonstrated that the pooled sensitivity of the six imaging techniques were sorted as follows: SWE > 18F-FCH PET/CT > 11C-choline PET/CT > TRTE > 11C-acetate PET/CT > 18F-FDG PET/CT; the pooled specificity were also compared: SWE > 18F-FCH PET/CT > 11C-choline PET/CT > TRTE > 18F-FDG PET/CT > 11C-acetate PET/CT; finally, the pooled diagnostic accuracy of the six imaging techniques based on AUC were ranked as below: SWE > 18F-FCH PET/CT > 11C-choline PET/CT > TRTE > 11C-acetate PET/CT > 18F-FDG PET/CT. SWE and 18F-FCH PET/CT imaging could offer more assistance in the early diagnosis of PCa than any other studied imaging techniques. However, the diagnostic ranking of the six imaging techniques might not be applicable to the clinical phase due to the shortage of stratified analysis.""","""['Qiaohong Ouyang', 'Zhongxiang Duan', 'Jixiao Lei', 'Guangli Jiao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Influence of Four Radiotracers in PET/CT on Diagnostic Accuracy for Prostate Cancer: A Bivariate Random-Effects Meta-Analysis.', 'Detection of the Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases: Is It Feasible to Compare 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and 99mTc-methyl Diphosphonate Bone Scintigraphy?', 'Pairwise comparison of 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with rising PSA and known or suspected second malignancy.', 'The role of 11C-choline and 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/CT in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular Mechanisms Related with Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer-Is It Just a Matter of Numbers?', 'Diagnostic Performance of PET Imaging Using Different Radiopharmaceuticals in Prostate Cancer According to Published Meta-Analyses.']"""

We aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of LUTS in a cohort of Caucasian-European men who have sex with men seeking medical help for uroandrologic reasons other than LUTS.  Methods:   Data from 949 consecutive individuals in an outpatient setting were analysed. Severity of LUTS was measured with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Men with storage symptoms scored 1-3 and ⩾ 4 (of 15), and voiding symptoms scored 1-4 and ⩾ 5 (of 20) were considered as having mild and moderate-to-severe symptoms, respectively. For individual symptoms, patients with scores ⩾ 1 were deemed symptomatic (according to Apostolidis et al.(15)). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models tested the association between LUTS and sexual orientation.  Results:   Complete data were available for 213 (22.4%) men who have sex with men (MSM) and 736 (77.6%) heterosexuals (mean age (s.d.): 41.0 (12.2) vs 39.9 (12.1) years).

Patients and methods:   Eight hundred and eighteen patients at our clinic had histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas of the prostate between January, 2000 and January, 2013.  Results:   The age distribution was from 47 to 100 years-old, with a median age of 72 years-old at diagnosis. Clinical TNM staging indicated that 301 cases (36.8%) were stage I, 303 cases (37.0%) were stage II, 101 cases (12.3%) were stage III and 113 cases (13.8%) were stage IV. Three hundred and fifty two cases (43.0%) received some form of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Retropubic prostatectomy (RPX) or radiation therapy (RT), including external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy, was performed in 242 (29.6%) and 136 (16.6%) cases, respectively. The median overall survival was 56.3 months and the respective cause specific 5 year and 10 year survival rates of the 818 cases were 92.0% and 77.8%. Respectively, they were 100% and 100% for T1, 98.7% and 97.4% for T2, 90.7% and 38.5% for T3, and 60.8% and 38.9% for T4.

Here we report and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multimodal treatment in a patient with pituitary metastasis of a prostate foamy gland carcinoma. A 78-year-old male patient presented with blurred vision and headache without a previous history of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a large sellar mass, with infiltration of the surrounding structures. Maximal transsphenoidal reduction of pituitary metastasis was performed, with a histologic finding of metastatic prostate foamy gland adenocarcinoma. Evaluation of the prostate specific antigen revealed a very high level (1461 ng/mL) and foamy gland carcinoma was found on prostate needle biopsy. The patient received 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy with 6 MV photons to the sellar and parasellar region with a tumor dose of 44 Gy, followed by androgen deprivation therapy. Follow up magnetic resonance imaging done after radiotherapy showed shrinkage of the tumor process, with rapid prostate specific antigen decline to 0.3 ng/mL. The visual function was fully established and headache resolved. On the last follow up 14 months after the diagnosis, the patient was alive and free from clinical signs of disease. Tailored treatment, including limited radiotherapy in a higher palliative dose, in a patient with foamy gland symptomatic pituitary metastatic disease resulted in good local and systemic control of the disease.

We test the hypothesis that the impact of SM on clinical recurrence (CR) rate may vary based on the other clinical/pathologic characteristics of the tumor.  Materials and methods:   We focused on 5290 patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic node dissection, between 2002 and 2013, at three tertiary care centers. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into risk groups based on their tumor characteristics and the corresponding CR rate. Kaplan-Meier log-rank and multivariable Cox regression models tested the relationship between SM status and CR rate in each tree-generated risk group.  Results:   Mean (median) follow-up time was 47.7 (39.0) months. Regression tree analysis that considered all available covariates, except SM status, divided patients based on their CR risk into the following risk groups: (1) high risk (any pT3b/pT4 disease); (2) intermediate risk (≤pT3a disease and pGS 8-10); (3) low risk (≤pT3a, pGS ≤7, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >9 ng/mL); and (4) very low risk (≤pT3a, pGS ≤7, and PSA ≤9 ng/mL). Positive SM had a significant detrimental impact on CR risk only in two groups: intermediate risk (p < 0.001) and high risk (p = 0.01). These observations were confirmed by multivariable analyses.  Conclusions:   Our findings show that positive SM had a detrimental impact on CR only in a minority of patients (15%), specifically in those with advanced pathologic stage and/or pathologically poorly differentiated tumor.

The primary outcome was biochemical progression free survival (BPFS) as defined by the Phoenix criteria (nadir PSA +2 ng/mL). Secondary outcomes of continence (defined as strictly no leak) and potency (able to have intercourse) were patient reported. Factors influencing BPFS were evaluated individually using Kaplan Meier and in a multivariate model using Cox regression.  Results:   Altogether, 300 men were included for analysis. The median follow-up was 18.2 months (mean 28.4) and median BPFS was 69.8 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated 2- and 5-year BPFS rate was 77.2% and 59.1%, respectively. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was administered to 41% of men and this tended to occur in men with larger prostates, likely as a technical consideration for downsizing before cryosurgery. At multivariate analysis, the presence of Gleason score 9 or 10 (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.9) and a posttreatment PSA nadir of ≥0.4 ng/mL (HR 5.7) were the only significant variables associated with biochemical progression using Cox regression.

Previous studies have shown that adding total extraperitoneal (TEP) IH repair to extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) lacks adverse effects. However, outcomes of extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) and TEP are unknown. We compared RALP+TEP with LRP+TEP and also with RALP alone.  Methods:   Eleven RALP+TEP cases were retrospectively compared with 26 LRP+TEP cases and 22 control RALP without TEP. Outcomes compared between groups included operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), discharge hematocrit (hct), time to diet advancement, length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative complications, and hernia recurrence.  Results:   Unilateral TEP added 32 minutes to RALP and 31 minutes to LRP, whereas bilateral TEP added 80 minutes to RALP and 36 minutes to LRP. There were no differences between RALP+TEP and LRP+TEP or RALP without TEP controls in regard to EBL, discharge hct, time to diet advancement, LOS, or postoperative complications. One patient developed an anterior mesh seroma, which resolved without intervention. No IH recurrences were noted on the mean follow-up of 33 months in the RALP group and 50 months in the LRP cohort.  Conclusions:   Unilateral and bilateral TEP added operative time to RALP but had equivalent outcomes to both LRP+TEP and RALP alone. This is likely due to the similar surgical space used for RALP and TEP, which obviates the need for substantial further dissection.

Under a very low light irradiation (60 mW cm(-2)), only targeted AuNP clusters kill the prostate cancer cells in minutes (not in other cell types), whereas neither nontargeted AuNP clusters nor citrate-stabilized AuNPs cause any significant cell death. The result suggests that the prostate cancer cell-targeted clusters of AuNPs are targeted to only prostate cancer cells and, when illuminated, generate local heating to more efficiently and selectively kill the targeted cancer cells. Our strategy can be generalized to target other types of cells and assemble other kinds of nanoparticles for a broad range of applications.""","""['Mi Hwa Oh', 'Jeong Heon Yu', 'Insu Kim', 'Yoon Sung Nam']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Gold nanoparticles stabilize peptide-drug-conjugates for sustained targeted drug delivery to cancer cells.', 'Multifunctional targeted therapy system based on (99m) Tc/(177) Lu-labeled gold nanoparticles-Tat(49-57)-Lys(3) -bombesin internalized in nuclei of prostate cancer cells.', 'Photothermal therapeutic response of cancer cells to aptamer-gold nanoparticle-hybridized graphene oxide under NIR illumination.', 'Towards Effective Photothermal/Photodynamic Treatment Using Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles.', 'A Nanotechnology-based Strategy to Increase the Efficiency of Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy: Folate-conjugated Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials using microbial cells and bacteriophages.', 'Biomedical applications of solid-binding peptides and proteins.', 'T7 Phage as an Emerging Nanobiomaterial with Genetically Tunable Target Specificity.', 'Plant Viruses and Bacteriophage-Based Reagents for Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'Gold nanoparticle clusters for the investigation of therapeutic efficiency against prostate cancer under near-infrared irradiation.']"""

In the Health ABC prospective study of 2,490 adults aged 70-79 years at baseline, we assessed whether circulating levels of three markers of systemic inflammation, IL-6, CRP and TNF-α, were associated with the risk of CRC and OBRC, a cluster including cancers of pancreas, prostate, breast and endometrium. Inflammatory markers were measured in stored fasting blood samples. While only baseline measures of TNF-α were available, IL-6 and CRP were additionally measured at Years 2, 4, 6 and 8. Multivariable Cox models were fit to determine whether tertiles and log-transformed baseline, updated and averaged measures of CRP and IL-6 and baseline measures of TNF-α were associated with the risk of incident cancer(s). During a median follow-up of 11.9 years, we observed 55 and 172 cases of CRC and OBRC, respectively. The hazard of CRC in the highest tertile of updated CRP was more than double that in the lowest tertile (HR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.08-4.86). No significant associations were seen between colorectal cancer and IL-6 or TNF-α. Additionally, no significant associations were found between obesity-related cancers and the three inflammatory markers overall, but we observed a suggestion of effect modification by BMI and NSAID use. In summary, in this population, higher CRP levels were associated with increased risk of CRC, but not of OBRC.

The UK5099 treated cells showed significantly higher proportion of side population (SP) fraction and expressed higher levels of stemness markers Oct3/4 and Nanog. Chemosensitivity examinations revealed that the UK5099 treated cells became more resistant to chemotherapy compared to the non-treated cells. These results demonstrate probably an intimate connection between metabolic reprogram and stem-like phenotype of LnCap cells in vitro. We propose that MPC blocker (UK5099) application may be an ideal model for Warburg effect studies, since it attenuates mitochondrial OXPHOS and increases aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon typically reflected in the Warburg effect.

Biomarkers for outcome prediction are urgently needed, so that high-risk patients could be monitored more closely postoperatively. To identify prognostic markers and to determine causal players in prostate cancer progression, we assessed changes in chromatin state during tumor development and progression. Based on this, we assessed genomewide androgen receptor/chromatin binding and identified a distinct androgen receptor/chromatin binding profile between primary prostate cancers and tumors with an acquired resistance to therapy. These differential androgen receptor/chromatin interactions dictated expression of a distinct gene signature with strong prognostic potential. Further refinement of the signature provided us with a concise list of nine genes that hallmark prostate cancer outcome in multiple independent validation series. In this report, we identified a novel gene expression signature for prostate cancer outcome through generation of multilevel genomic data on chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation and integration with publically available transcriptomic and clinical datastreams.

Methods and materials:   A total of 29 fiducial markers (FMs) were implanted in 10 patients through the transperineal approach, under ultrasound guidance. After 2 weeks from the FM implantation, all the patients underwent CT and magnetic resonance imaging under radiation therapy-planning conditions. The planning CT was the reference CT (CTref) used to calculate the initial intermarker distances. For every patient, 8 CBCTi (i varying from 1 to 8) acquired once a week during the treatment course were selected to calculate intermarker distances and compared with CTref. Reconstructed images of CBCTi were exported to the treatment planning system, and every FM was contoured. A point of interest at the center of mass of each contoured FM was created. The mean coordinates obtained for point of interest at the center of mass of FMs were used to calculate relative marker distances on CTref and CBCTi.  Results:   No patient developed postimplantation complications. A total of 224 marker distance variations (MDVs) were calculated for all 29 markers. The average directional variation of all MDVs (± standard deviation [SD]) was -0.14 ± 0.86 mm. The average absolute variations of all MDVs (± SD) were 0.71 ± 0.51 mm. The largest observed variation was 1.9 mm. All patients had not significant temporal trends in their marker distances. The SD of the MDVs was computed for each set of markers in all 10 patients. The SDs ranged between 0.4 and 1.1 mm in individual patients. The average of the mean SDs was 0.6 mm.

The utility of these iCOGS SNPs remains to be determined in active surveillance (AS).  Objective:   To determine associations between iCOGS SNPs and upgrading among men who underwent surgical treatment and AS for low-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   The genotypes of the 23 iCOGS SNPs were determined for all white subjects with biopsy Gleason score (GS) 6 including 950 men who underwent definitive treatment with surgery and 209 men who elected AS. The clinical and pathologic characteristics were documented for all subjects.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Men who underwent surgery were grouped according to their pathologic GS (upgraded was defined as GS ≥7; nonupgraded remained GS 6). Men who were enrolled in AS were also grouped according to their GS on subsequent surveillance biopsies. Statistical analyses were performed comparing the genotypes between the upgraded and nonupgraded groups.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 31% and 34% of men were upgraded in the surgery and AS cohorts, respectively. Three iCOGS SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of upgrading in the surgical cohort. After correction for multiple testing, only rs11568818 on chromosome 11q22 remained significantly associated with upgrading. Assessment of this allele in the AS cohort reveals that it was present at noteworthy higher frequencies in men with high-grade disease on surveillance biopsies compared with nonupgraded men (p=0.003). This study was primarily limited by the homogeneous patient population.  Conclusions:   This is the first report of a SNP on chromosome 11q22 associated with higher grade disease in a surgical cohort that is also validated for eventual upgrading in a prospective AS cohort.  Patient summary:   We examined the relationship between a group of genetic markers and prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness in a group of patients who underwent surgery for PCa and a group of patients who were enrolled in active surveillance.

Here, we report HOTAIR as an androgen-repressed lncRNA, and, as such, it is markedly upregulated following androgen deprivation therapies and in CRPC. We further demonstrate a distinct mode of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation, wherein HOTAIR binds to the AR protein to block its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, thereby preventing AR ubiquitination and protein degradation. Consequently, HOTAIR expression is sufficient to induce androgen-independent AR activation and drive the AR-mediated transcriptional program in the absence of androgen. Functionally, HOTAIR overexpression increases, whereas HOTAIR knockdown decreases, prostate cancer cell growth and invasion.

The study included 154 hospitals (as of April 2014) that were queried about their radical prostatectomy case loads from January 2009 to December 2013, strategies for installation of the equipment in their hospitals, and other topics related to the study purpose. The overall response rate of hospitals was 63%, though it marginally varied according to type and area. The annual case load was determined based on the results of the questionnaire and other modalities. It increased from 3,518 in 2009 to 6,425 in 2013. The case load seemed to be concentrated in hospitals with robot equipment since the increase of their number was very minimal over the 5 years. The hospitals with the robot treated a larger number of newly diagnosed patients with the disease than before. Most of the patients were those having localized cancer that was indicated for radical surgery, suggesting again the concentration of the surgical case loads in the hospitals with robots. While most hospitals believed that installation of a robot was necessary as an option for treatment procedures, the future strategy of the hospital, and other reasons, the action of the hospital to gain prestige may be involved in the process of purchasing the equipment. In conclusion, robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has become popular as a surgical procedure for prostate cancer in our society. This may lead to a concentration of the surgical case load in a limited number of hospitals with robots.

However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown. We integrated chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional androgen receptor-binding sites (ARBSs). Among the 48 GWAS index risk SNPs and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBSs. Of these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the melanophilin gene (MLPH) was within a novel putative auxiliary AR-binding motif, which is enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen-responsive elements. T→G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an AR reporter gene assay. The expression of MLPH in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those with the G compared with the T allele and correlated significantly with AR protein. Higher melanophilin level in prostate tissue of patients with a favorable PCa risk profile points out a tumor-suppressive effect.

This study assessed how prostate cancer treatment type, patient mood, and sexual function related to dyadic adjustment from patient and partner perspectives.  Methods:   Men with prostate cancer (n = 206) and partners of men with prostate cancer (n = 66) completed an online survey assessing the patients' mood (profile of mood states short form), their dyadic adjustment (dyadic adjustment scale), and sexual function (expanded prostate cancer index composite).  Results:   Analyses of covariance found that men on ADT reported better dyadic adjustment compared with men not on ADT. Erectile dysfunction was high for all patients, but a multivariate analysis of variance found that those on ADT experienced greater bother at loss of sexual function than patients not on ADT, suggesting that loss of libido when on ADT does not mitigate the psychological distress associated with loss of erections. In a multiple linear regression, patients' mood predicted their dyadic adjustment, such that worse mood was related to worse dyadic adjustment. However, more bother with patients' overall sexual function predicted lower relationship scores for the patients, while the patients' lack of sexual desire predicted lower dyadic adjustment for partners.  Conclusions:   Both patients and partners are impacted by the prostate cancer treatment effects on patients' psychological and sexual function. Our data help clarify the way that prostate cancer treatments can affect relationships and that loss of libido on ADT does not attenuate distress about erectile dysfunction. Understanding these changes may help patients and partners maintain a co-supportive relationship. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The pathologic diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma can be challenging due to its rarity and overlapping features with other primary and secondary malignancies.

Cases:   We report 2 cases of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the male urethra, one with possible origin from Littrè glands and the other from the prostatic urethra.

Light reflectance spectroscopy, which measures light intensity reflected or backscattered from tissues, can be applied to differentiate malignant from benign tissue. We used a novel light reflectance spectroscopy probe to evaluate positive surgical margins on ex vivo radical prostatectomy specimens and correlate its findings with pathological examination.  Materials and methods:   Patients with intermediate to high risk disease undergoing radical prostatectomy were enrolled. Light reflectance spectroscopy was performed on suspected malignant and benign prostate capsule immediately following organ extraction. Each light reflectance spectroscopy at 530 to 830 nm was analyzed and correlated with pathological results. A regression model and forward sequential selection algorithm were developed for optimal feature selection. Eighty percent of light reflectance spectroscopy data were selected to train a logistic regression model, which was evaluated by the remaining 20% data. This was repeated 5 times to calculate averaged sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.  Results:   Light reflectance spectroscopy analysis was performed on 17 ex vivo prostate specimens, on which a total of 11 histologically positive and 22 negative surgical margins were measured. Two select features from 700 to 830 nm were identified as unique to malignant tissue. Cross-validation when performing the predictive model showed that the optical probe predicted positive surgical margins with 85% sensitivity, 86% specificity, 86% accuracy and an AUC of 0.95.  Conclusions:   Light reflectance spectroscopy can identify positive surgical margins accurately in fresh ex vivo radical prostatectomy specimens. Further study is required to determine whether such analysis may be used in real time to improve surgical decision making and decrease positive surgical margin rates.""","""['Monica S C Morgan', 'Aaron H Lay', 'Xinlong Wang', 'Payal Kapur', 'Asim Ozayar', 'Maryam Sayah', 'Li Zeng', 'Hanli Liu', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Jeffrey A Cadeddu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Detecting positive surgical margins: utilisation of light-reflectance spectroscopy on ex vivo prostate specimens.', 'The feasibility of prostate cancer detection by triple spectroscopy.', 'Role of frozen section analysis of surgical margins during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a 2608-case experience.', 'Incidence, etiology, location, prevention and treatment of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Ex vivo fluorescence confocal microscopy: prostatic and periprostatic tissues atlas and evaluation of the learning curve.', 'Targeting aggressive prostate cancer-associated CD44v6 using phage display selected peptides.']"""

Results:   Three months after treatment, acute GU and GI toxicities were reported in 10.8% and 7.2%. Acute toxicity resolved within two months in the majority of patients (61%). Late grade ⩾ 2 GU and GI toxicity were reported in 19.7% and 3.3% of patients 12 months after HDR-BT. Mean QLQ-PR25 scores showed clinically relevant changes from baseline for urinary symptoms and sexual functioning. With a mean follow-up of 35 months, biochemical failure was observed in 2.4%.
