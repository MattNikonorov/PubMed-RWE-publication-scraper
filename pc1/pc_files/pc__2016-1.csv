Results from the REDUCE Trial""","""Background:   It has been shown that increased prostate size is a risk factor for lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) progression in men who currently have LUTS presumed due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Objective:   To determine if prostate size is a risk factor for incident LUTS in men with mild to no symptoms.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study, which contained a substantial number of men (n=3090) with mild to no LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] <8).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary outcome was determination of the effect of prostate size on incident LUTS presumed due to BPH defined as two consecutive IPSS values >14, or receiving any medical (α-blockers) or surgical treatment for BPH throughout the study course. To determine the risk of developing incident LUTS, we used univariable and multivariable Cox models, as well as Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test.  Results and limitations:   Among men treated with placebo during the REDUCE study, those with a prostate size of 40.1-80ml had a 67% higher risk (hazard risk 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.23-2.26, p=0.001) of developing incident LUTS compared to men with a prostate size 40.0ml or smaller. There was no association between prostate size and risk of incident LUTS in men treated with 0.5mg of dutasteride. The post hoc nature of our study design is a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   Men with mild to no LUTS but increased prostate size are at higher risk of incident LUTS presumed due to BPH. This association was negated by dutasteride treatment.  Patient summary:   Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common problem among older men, which often manifests as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and can lead to potentially serious side effects. In our study we determined that men with mild to no current LUTS but increased prostate size are much more likely to develop LUTS presumed due to BPH in the future. This association was not seen in men treated with dutasteride, a drug approved for treatment of BPH. Our study reveals that men with a prostate size of 40.1-80ml are potential candidates for closer follow-up.""","""['Ross M Simon', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Claus Roehrborn', 'Adriana C Vidal', 'Ramiro Castro-Santamaria', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate Volume as a Risk Factor for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: The Quest Continues.', 'Results from the reduce trial on the effect of prostate size on incident lower urinary tract symptoms in men with mild to no current symptoms: do they justify prophylactic intervention?', 'Statin Use and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Incidence and Progression in Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) Trial.', 'Smoking and lower urinary tract symptoms in Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events\xa0Trial.', 'PSA predicts development of incident lower urinary tract symptoms: results from the REDUCE study.', 'EAU guidelines on the treatment and follow-up of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction.', 'Tadalafil - a therapeutic option in the management of BPH-LUTS.', 'How does symptom severity impact clinical outcomes of men with lower urinary tract symptoms after holmium laser enucleation or transurethral resection of the prostate?', 'Updates on Preprocedural Evaluation and Patient Selection for Prostatic Artery Embolization.', 'Prostate volume, baseline urinary function, and their association with treatment choice and post-treatment urinary function in men treated for localized prostate cancer.', 'The P.R.OS.T.A.T.E Nomogram for the Preoperative Prediction of Clinical Efficacy of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Patients.', 'A multicenter retrospective study of transurethral prostate split for benign prostate hyperplasia.']"""

Objective:   To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Göteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of ≥ 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI. Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA ≥ 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy. SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI. Three screening strategies were compared (PSA ≥ 3.0+SB; PSA ≥ 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA ≥ 1.8+MRI+TB).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.  Results and limitations:   In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naïve men. Both PSA ≥ 3.0+MRI and PSA ≥ 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA ≥ 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p<0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA ≥ 1.8+MRI compared with PSA ≥ 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008). The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA ≥ 1.8+MRI compared with PSA ≥ 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA ≥ 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%). The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.  Conclusion:   A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity. If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.  Patient summary:   Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.""","""['Anna Grenabo Bergdahl', 'Ulrica Wilderäng', 'Gunnar Aus', 'Sigrid Carlsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Maria Frånlund', 'Kjell Geterud', 'Ali Khatami', 'Andreas Socratous', 'Johan Stranne', 'Mikael Hellström', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum re: ""Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Göteborg Randomised Screening Trial"" Eur Urol 2016;70:566-73.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Focusing on What Really Matters.', 'The GÖTEBORG prostate cancer screening 2 trial: a prospective, randomised, population-based prostate cancer screening trial with prostate-specific antigen testing followed by magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate.', 'Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in targeting prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'Theranostics of Primary Prostate Cancer: Beyond PSMA and GRP-R.', 'Androgens, aging, and prostate health.', 'MRI as a screening tool for prostate cancer: current evidence and future challenges.', 'Beyond Prostate Specific Antigen: New Prostate Cancer Screening Options.', 'Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Discrimination of the Four Kallikrein Panel Associated With the Inclusion of Prostate Volume.']"""

Materials and methods:   We identified 422 patients who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network® very low (199) and low risk (223) prostate cancer definitions who instead underwent radical prostatectomy. In each risk category we compared adverse pathological outcomes, defined as Gleason score upgrading, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive surgical margins, between men diagnosed on initial prostate biopsy vs repeat/subsequent prostate biopsy after a negative biopsy(-ies).  Results:   There were no significant differences in the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics between the groups. However, men who were diagnosed on initial prostate biopsy demonstrated a higher median maximum cancer percent per single core (p <0.001) and higher median percent of positive cores (p <0.001). Compared to repeat/subsequent prostate biopsy, men diagnosed on initial prostate biopsy had a higher Gleason score upgrade (7 or greater) (57.7% vs 42.1%, p=0.005) and extraprostatic extension (14.1% vs 5.4%, p=0.01). On stratified analysis comparing initial prostate biopsy to repeat/subsequent prostate biopsy, very low risk disease was associated with Gleason score upgrade (49.3% vs 31.8%, p=0.02) and low risk disease demonstrated higher rates of extraprostatic extension (19.9% vs 6.0%, p=0.02).  Conclusions:   The likelihood of adverse pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy is lower in men diagnosed with favorable risk prostate cancer on repeat/subsequent prostate biopsy than in men diagnosed on initial prostate biopsy, and may represent an important consideration in risk stratifying cases of favorable risk prostate cancer.""","""['Ahmed ElShafei', 'Yaw Nyame', 'Onder Kara', 'Atef Badawy', 'Ifeanyi Amujiogu', 'Khaled Fareed', 'Eric Klein', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Reply by Authors.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Re: More Favorable Pathological Outcomes in Men with Low\xa0Risk Prostate Cancer Diagnosed on Repeat versus Initial\xa0Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy: A.

Importantly, although biochemical recurrence is a significant clinical outcome, it is not a validated surrogate for PCa-related mortality. Thus, we evaluated the association between SChLAP1 expression and development of lethal PCa in a large cohort of American men with PCa and long-term follow-up. SChLAP1 ISH was performed on tissue microarrays containing representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PCa tissue from all patients and scored using a semiquantitative method (ISH score range 0-400). Hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between SChLAP1 expression and time to development of lethal PCa were estimated using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Of the 937 patients evaluated, 89 (9.5%) had high SChLAP1 expression (ISH score ≥100), which in patients treated with radical prostatectomy was strongly associated with development of lethal PCa independent of age, Gleason score, pathologic stage, and PTEN status (HR 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.1). These results suggest that SChLAP1 may be a useful tissue-based biomarker for identifying PCa patients at higher risk of lethal progression.

Direct toxic effect or metabolic derangement of chemotherapeutic agents may cause these complications. Cabazitaxel is a next generation semi-synthetic taxane derivative, which is effective in both preclinical models of human tumors sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy and in patients with progressive prostate cancer despite docetaxel treatment.  Aim:   The primary aim of this study was to investigate the central nervous system toxicity of Cabazitaxel. Secondary aim was to investigate the safety dose of Cabazitaxel for the central nervous system.  Methods:   A total of 24 adult male Wistar-Albino rats were equally and randomly divided into four groups as follows: group 1 (Controls), group 2 (Cabazitaxel 0.5mg/kg), group 3 (Cabazitaxel 1.0mg/kg) and group 4 (Cabazitaxel 1.5mg/kg). Cabazitaxel (Jevtana, Sanofi-Aventis USA) was intraperitoneally administered to groups 2, 3 and 4 at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5mg/kg (body-weight/week) doses, respectively for four consecutive weeks. Beside this, group 1 received only i.p. saline at the same volume and time. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed and bilateral brain hemispheres were removed for biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations.  Results:   Intraperitoneal administration of Cabazitaxel has exerted neurotoxic effect on rat brain.

Patients and methods:   This was an epidemiological, observational, prospective and multicentre study. Of the 3,918 patients diagnosed with PC during 2010, only those patients with localised PC were included. Follow-up was ultimately conducted for a minimum of one year from the diagnosis for 3,713 patients (94.77%). The treatment groups assessed were as follows: radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, brachytherapy, active surveillance or observation and experimental local treatment (cryotherapy or other treatment). Compliance with the recommendations of the EAU guidelines was studied, describing the treatment groups according to D'Amico risk stratification criteria (localised [low, intermediate and high risk] and locally advanced), age, PSA and Gleason score.  Results:   By applying the D'Amico criteria, we included 3,641 (92.93%) patients. Based on the UAE recommendations: 1) 68.87% of the patients at low-intermediate risk aged≤65 years underwent radical prostatectomy; 2) 34.51% of the patients>65 years at high risk with locally advanced disease were administered radiation therapy and hormone therapy; 3) 30.36% of the patients at high risk with locally advanced disease were only treated with hormone therapy; 4) 15.20% of the patients at low risk were only treated with brachytherapy; 5) active surveillance or observation was selected for 2.44% of the patients aged≤65 years and for 10.63% of the patients at low-intermediate risk who were>65 years. Lastly, 86.5% of the patients at low risk underwent a single treatment, and 43.62% of the patients at high risk with locally advanced disease underwent combined treatments.  Conclusions:   This is the first national European study to evaluate the therapeutic management of localised PC based on the risk group to which the patient belonged. Most young patients (≤65 years) with low-intermediate risk localised PC were treated with surgery, which adheres to the recommendations of the 2010 UAE guidelines.

We present a large institutional series with extended followup to create an oncologic risk stratification system that clarifies the prognostic heterogeneity for patients with pN+ disease after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Men with pN+ prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy during 1987 to 2012 were included in the study. Regression models were created to identify significant predictors of biochemical recurrence, metastasis, cancer specific mortality and overall mortality. A cancer specific mortality risk score was then created and internally validated to stratify patients in terms of risk of cancer specific mortality.  Results:   For our cohort of 1,011 men with a median followup of 17.6 years the 20-year rate of cancer specific mortality was 31%. On multivariate Cox regression modeling 3 or more positive nodes (HR 1.75, p=0.003), pathological Gleason score 7 vs 6 (HR 1.74, p=0.04) and 8-10 vs 6 (HR 2.63, p=0.001), and positive surgical margins (HR 1.96, p=0.001) were significantly associated with increased cancer specific mortality, while adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.40, p=0.008) was associated with decreased cancer specific mortality. A cancer specific mortality risk score was then created using these 4 variables to stratify patients with markedly different prognoses, yielding 20-year cancer specific mortality rates of 19.1% vs 34% vs 46% (p <0.001) for low, intermediate and high risk categories, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Patient-specific MA was performed on data from 2 studies (732 patients) using the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS; scale 0-100) together with Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group as predictors of the likelihood of favorable pathology (LFP). Risk profile curves associating GPS with LFP by CAPRA score and NCCN risk group were generated. Decision curves and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated using patient-specific MA risk estimates.  Results:   Patient-specific MA-generated risk profiles ensure more precise estimates of LFP with narrower confidence intervals than either study alone. GPS added significant predictive value to each clinical classifier. A model utilizing GPS and CAPRA provided the most risk discrimination. In decision-curve analysis, greater net benefit was shown when combining GPS with each clinical classifier compared with the classifier alone. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.68 to 0.73 by adding GPS to CAPRA, and 0.64 to 0.70 by adding GPS to NCCN risk group. The proportion of patients with LFP >80% increased from 11% using NCCN risk group alone to 23% using GPS with NCCN. Using GPS with CAPRA identified the highest proportion-31%-of patients with LFP >80%.

MicroRNAs is a class of short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs and play an important role in biological process and cellular functions. We hypothesized we could find differentially expressed microRNAs in the myometrium of women in spontaneous preterm labor. Thus, a microarray analysis of miRNAs of preterm myometrium was performed. 18 out of the 2006 detected microRNAs were found to be significantly dysregulated in myometrium in labor verse not in labor at preterm. Biological validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirms us a consistence rate of 83.3% (5 out of 6) with microarray analysis. The target genes for validated microRNAs were predicted by three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan, and miRanda). Most of the potential targets of the miRNAs were relevant to positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy, reduction of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and relaxation of cardiac muscle as well as prostate cancer, adherents junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and regulation and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of down-regulating CCR7 expression on the growth of human prostate cancer cells stimulated by VEGFC. The CCR7-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) plasmid vector was constructed and then transfected into prostate cancer cells. The expression of CCR7 mRNA and protein was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and cell migration were assessed following knockdown of CCR7 by RNA interference (RNAi). Western blot analysis was used to identify differentially expressed angiogenesis- and cell cycle-associated proteins in cells with silenced CCR7. The expression levels of CCR7 in prostate cancer cells transfected with siRNA were decreased, leading to a significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by VEGFC. Western blot analysis revealed that silencing of CCR7 may inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 protein expression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that RNAi can effectively silence CCR7 gene expression and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells, which indicates that there is a potential of targeting CCR7 as a novel gene therapy approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Bao-Jin Chi', 'Cong-Lin Du', 'Yun-Feng Fu', 'Ya-Nan Zhang', 'Ru Wen Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['RNAi-mediated silencing of VEGF-C inhibits non-small cell lung cancer progression by simultaneously down-regulating the CXCR4, CCR7, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3-dependent axes-induced ERK, p38 and AKT signalling pathways.', 'Silencing of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibits the growth, invasion and migration of ovarian cancer cells.', 'CCR7 silence by siRNA inhibits proliferation, invasion and promotes apoptosis of human MG63 osteosarcoma cells.', 'CSN5 silencing inhibits invasion and arrests cell cycle progression in human colorectal cancer SW480 and LS174T cells in vitro.', 'S100A4 silencing suppresses proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion of thyroid cancer cells through downregulation of MMP-9 and VEGF.', 'Radiotherapy-Related Gene Signature in Prostate Cancer.', 'C-C Chemokine Receptor 7 in Cancer.', 'Does CCL19 act as a double-edged sword in cancer development?', 'Rethinking the chemokine cascade in brain metastasis: Preventive and therapeutic implications.', 'Chemokine-Directed Tumor Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

For example, human MMP-26/endometase/matrilysin-2 was reported to be either protective or pro-tumorigenic. Our previous reports suggested pro-invasion and anti-inflammation properties in prostate cancer. Here, we provide evidence for a protective role of MMP-26 in the prostate. MMP-26 expression levels in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) cells, transfected with sense or anti-sense MMP-26 cDNA, are directly correlated with those of the pro-apoptotic marker Bax. Immunohistochemical staining of prostate cancer tissue samples shows similar protein expression patterns, correlating the expression levels of MMP-26 and Bax in benign, neoplastic, and invasive prostate cancer tissues. The MMP-26 protein levels were upregulated in high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and decreased during the course of disease progression. Further analysis using an indirect terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that many tumor cells expressing MMP-26 were undergoing apoptosis. This study showed that the high level of MMP-26 expression is positively correlated with the presence of apoptotic cells.

Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK) is predominantly localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria and catalyzes the reversible exchange of high-energy phosphate between adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine. However, little is known about its expression and function in human prostate cancer progression.  Method:   We investigated the expression of uMtCK in 148 prostate carcinoma tissues and matched normal tissue by immunohistochemistry. The expression and localization of uMtCK and hexokinase II, a marker of glycolysis, were examined in prostate carcinoma cell lines using western blot and immunofluorescence.  Results:   MtCK expression was significantly lower in high Gleason grade carcinoma compared with normal prostate or low grade carcinoma. Western blot further revealed that uMtCK was highly expressed in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell lines, as well as in the normal prostate cell line RWPE-1. However, uMtCK expression was almost absent in PC3 and DU145 cell lines, in correlation with absent or mutant p53 expression, respectively. In contrast, hexokinase II was overexpressed in PC3 cells. Moreover, in the low uMtCK expressing cell lines, glycolytic ATP production was increased, whereas mitochondrial ATP production was decreased.

We provide cancer statistics of 33,201 patients from all Sudan diagnosed at the Radiation and Isotope Centre in Khartoum (RICK). This hospital covers approximately 80% of patients with cancer in Sudan and is, therefore, considered representative for the situation in this country.  Materials and methods:   Data from 2009-2013 were collected at RICK. Cancer diagnoses were made by standard pathological and radiological methods. Epidemiological data were categorized by age, gender, resident state, marital status etc. and subjected to statistical analyses by SPSS 21v.  Results:   The cancer prevalence rate per year was 5,000-7,000 among adults and 300-400 among children, with increasing tendency for adults. Male:female ratios were 1:1.18 for adults and 1.46:1 for children. The five most frequent tumour types were breast cancer, leukaemia, prostatic carcinoma, lymphoma and colorectal carcinoma in adults and leukaemia, lymphoma, eye tumours, sarcoma and brain tumours in children. Remarkably, the median age of cancer diagnosis was 10-20 years higher in men than in women, mainly due to earlier onset of gender-related tumours in females (cancer of breast, cervix, or ovary) than in men (prostatic carcinoma). Chronic myeloid leukaemia was the most frequent haematopoietic malignancy in adults and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. Comparing cancer cases with population numbers of Sudanese states, Northern Sudan, River Nile and Khartoum revealed up to 8-fold higher cancer incidence rates than Al Gedarif, Southern Dafur and Blue Nile. The other states had intermediate incidence rates. Interestingly, oesophageal carcinoma occurred proportionally more frequently in Kassala (rank 3) than in the entire Sudan (rank 7) or other states.

Recently, we found that LNCaP androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells treated with MCS-C3 rapidly undergo intrinsic apoptosis through dramatic up-regulation of p21(CIP1). The present study aimed to evaluate the cellular functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of p21(CIP1) on apoptotic induction in LNCaP cells treated with 6 μM MCS-C3.  Materials and methods:   Western blots, flow cytometric assay, immunoprecipitation, and transmission electron microscopy analysis were used to measure apoptotic induction in 6-μM MCS-C3-treated LNCaP cells. Effects of MCS-C3 on gene expression of p21(CIP1) were measured by semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and small interfering RNA transfection.  Results:   MCS-C3 induced appreciable caspase-dependent apoptosis associated with the significant up-regulation of p53-dependent p21(CIP1) in LNCaP cells. Moreover, this apoptotic induction was caused by direct binding of p21(CIP1) to anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein, and antagonizing BCL2 function. In addition, MCS-C3-mediated apoptotic induction, and up-regulation of p21(CIP1) were almost completely blocked by the treatment of androgen-responsive LNCaP cells with flutamide, an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist.

Materials and methods:   Cells were irradiated with beta particles emitted from (177)Lu, alpha particles from (241)Am, or gamma rays from (137)Cs. A non-specific polyclonal antibody was labeled with (177)Lu and used to irradiate cells in suspension with beta particles. A previously described in-house developed alpha-particle irradiator based on a (241)Am source was used to irradiate cells with alpha particles. External gamma-ray irradiation was achieved using a standard (137)Cs irradiator. Cells were irradiated to absorbed doses equal to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 Gy. The absorbed doses were calculated as mean absorbed doses. For evaluation of cell survival, the tetrazolium-based WST-1 assay was used. After irradiation, WST-1 was added to the cell solutions, incubated, and then measured for level of absorbance at 450 nm, indicating the live and viable cells.  Results:   LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cell lines all had similar patterns of survival for the different radiation types. No significant difference in surviving fractions were observed between cells treated with beta-particle and gamma-ray irradiation, represented for example by the surviving fraction values (mean±SD) at 2, 6, and 10 Gy (SF2, SF6, and SF10) for DU145 after beta-particle irradiation: 0.700±0.090, 0.186±0.050 and 0.056±0.010, respectively. A strong radiosensitivity to alpha particles was observed, with SF2 values of 0.048±0.008, 0.018±0.006 and 0.015±0.005 for LNCaP, DU145, and PC3, respectively.  Conclusion:   The surviving fractions after irradiation using beta particles or gamma rays did not differ significantly at the absorbed dose levels and dose rates used. Irradiation using alpha particles led to a high level of cell killing. The results show that the beta-particle emitter (177)Lu as well as alpha-particles are both good candidates for radionuclide-therapy applications in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Jörgen Elgqvist', 'Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand', 'Erik Larsson', 'Sven-Erik Strand']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Cancer Cell Radiobiological Studies Using In-House-Developed α-Particle Irradiator.', 'Somatostatin-receptor-targeted alpha-emitting 213Bi is therapeutically more effective than beta(-)-emitting 177Lu in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Redefining Relative Biological Effectiveness in the Context of the EQDX Formalism: Implications for Alpha-Particle Emitter Therapy.', 'Therapeutic Radiometals Beyond 177Lu and 90Y: Production and Application of Promising α-Particle, β--Particle, and Auger Electron Emitters.', 'Does particle radiation have superior radiobiological advantages for prostate cancer cells?

However, little is known on the effect of LPA in regulating the function of both cancer cells and osteoclasts in the bone microenvironment.  Materials and methods:   PC-3 tumor growth and bone destruction upon LPA administration were observed in a mouse calvarium xenograft. The osteoclastogenic cytokines produced by LPA-stimulated prostate cancer cells were also defined.  Results:   LPA administration was found to increase PC-3 tumor growth and bone destruction in a mouse calvarium xenograft. Using a cytokine antibody array, LPA highly stimulated the expression and release of osteoclastogenic cytokines from PC-3 cells. Conditioned medium from LPA-stimulated PC-3 cells containing enhanced levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines facilitated osteoclast formation. Histopathologically, LPA administration supports the erosive type of bone destruction by PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

Anisamide is known to bind specifically to the sigma receptor which is overexpressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. The resulting nanocomplexes were slightly cationic and less than 300 nm in size. They successfully protected siRNA from serum-induced nuclease degradation and were non-toxic to prostate cancer cells. In addition, the targeted nanoparticles mediated high levels of siRNA cellular uptake and corresponding PLK1 gene knockdown in prostate cancer cells in vitro.

Methods:   We assessed the relation of first-degree family history of breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and cervical cancer and lymphoma or leukemia, to the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), ER(-), and triple-negative breast cancer in data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   There were 3,023 ER(+) and 1,497 ER(-) breast cancer cases (including 696 triple-negative cases) and 17,420 controls.

Through its Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain, LEDGF/p75 binds to histone marks associated with active transcription and promotes DNA end resection by recruiting DNA endonuclease retinoblastoma-binding protein 8 (RBBP8/CtIP) to broken DNA ends. Here we show that the structurally related PWWP domain-containing protein, hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HDGFRP2), serves a similar function in homologous recombination repair. Its depletion compromises the survival of human U2OS osteosarcoma and HeLa cervix carcinoma cells and impairs the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of replication protein A2 (RPA2) and the recruitment of DNA endonuclease RBBP8/CtIP to DNA double strand breaks. In contrast to LEDGF/p75, HDGFRP2 binds preferentially to histone marks characteristic for transcriptionally silent chromatin. Accordingly, HDGFRP2 is found in complex with the heterochromatin-binding chromobox homologue 1 (CBX1) and Pogo transposable element with ZNF domain (POGZ). Supporting the functionality of this complex, POGZ-depleted cells show a similar defect in DNA damage-induced RPA2 phosphorylation as HDGFRP2-depleted cells. These data suggest that HDGFRP2, possibly in complex with POGZ, recruits homologous recombination repair machinery to damaged silent genes or to active genes silenced upon DNA damage.""","""['Annika Baude', 'Tania Løve Aaes', 'Beibei Zhai', 'Nader Al-Nakouzi', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Mads Daugaard', 'Mikkel Rohde', 'Marja Jäättelä']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['LEDGF (p75) promotes DNA-end resection and homologous recombination.', 'The SWI/SNF ATPase BRG1 stimulates DNA end resection and homologous recombination by reducing nucleosome density at DNA double strand breaks and by promoting the recruitment of the CtIP nuclease.', 'Embryonic Lethality Due to Arrested Cardiac Development in Psip1/Hdgfrp2 Double-Deficient Mice.', 'The MRE11 complex: A versatile toolkit for the repair of broken DNA.', 'Chromatin dynamics during repair of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks.', 'HDGFRP3 interaction with 53BP1 promotes DNA double-strand break repair.', 'Mis-spliced transcripts generate de novo proteins in TDP-43-related ALS/FTD.', 'Characterization of Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Related Protein 2 Interactions with Heterochromatin.', 'Deficiency of CHAMP1, a gene related to intellectual disability, causes impaired neuronal development and a mild behavioural phenotype.', 'CHAMP1 binds to REV7/FANCV and promotes homologous recombination repair.']"""

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the driving force of carcinogenesis. Chronic arsenic exposure malignantly transforms the human normal prostate stem/progenitor cell (SC) line, WPE-stem to arsenic-cancer SCs (As-CSCs), through unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In prior work, miR-143 was markedly downregulated in As-CSCs, suggesting a role in arsenic-induced malignant transformation. In the present study, we investigated whether loss of miR-143 expression is important in arsenic-induced transformation of prostate SCs. Restoration of miR-143 in As-CSCs was achieved by lentivirus-mediated miR-143 overexpression. Cells were assessed bi-weekly for up to 30weeks to examine mitigation of cancer phenotype. Secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was increased by arsenic-induced malignant transformation, but miR-143 restoration decreased secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzyme activities compared with scramble controls. Increased cell proliferation and apoptotic resistance, two hallmarks of cancer, were decreased upon miR-143 restoration. Increased apoptosis was associated with decreased BCL2 and BCL-XL expression. miR-143 restoration dysregulated the expression of SC/CSC self-renewal genes including NOTCH-1, BMI-1, OCT4 and ABCG2. The anticancer effects of miR-143 overexpression appeared to be mediated by targeting and inhibiting LIMK1 protein, and the phosphorylation of cofilin, a LIMK1 substrate. These findings clearly show that miR-143 restoration mitigated multiple cancer characteristics in the As-CSCs, suggesting a potential role in arsenic-induced transformation of prostate SCs. Thus, miR-143 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for arsenic-induced prostate cancer.""","""['Ntube N O Ngalame', 'Ngome L Makia', 'Michael P Waalkes', 'Erik J Tokar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Silencing KRAS overexpression in arsenic-transformed prostate epithelial and stem cells partially mitigates malignant phenotype.', 'Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls RAS oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic.', 'Arsenic exposure transforms human epithelial stem/progenitor cells into a cancer stem-like phenotype.', 'Inorganic arsenic and human prostate cancer.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Extirpating the cancer stem cell hydra: Differentiation therapy and Hyperthermia therapy for targeting the cancer stem cell hierarchy.', 'miRNAs and arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.', 'Arsenic activates STAT3 signaling during the transformation of the human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'Health Effects Associated With Pre- and Perinatal Exposure to Arsenic.', 'Dysregulation of microRNAs in metal-induced angiogenesis and carcinogenesis.']"""

We reviewed long-term prostatectomy outcomes to assess the most appropriate prostate specific antigen cut point that predicts future disease progression.  Materials and methods:   We identified 13,512 patients with cT1-2N0M0 prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1987 and 2010. Single prostate specific antigen cut points of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 ng/ml or greater, as well as confirmatory prostate specific antigen value definitions of 0.2 ng/ml or greater followed by prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml and 0.4 ng/ml or greater followed by prostate specific antigen greater than 0.4 ng/ml were tested. Continued prostate specific antigen increase after a designated cut point definition was estimated using cumulative incidence. The strength of association between biochemical recurrence definitions and subsequent systemic progression were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models and the O'Quigley event based R(2) test.  Results:   At a median postoperative followup of 9.1 years (IQR 4.9-14.3) a detectable prostate specific antigen developed in 5,041 patients and systemic progression developed in 512. After reaching the prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 ng/ml, the percentage of patients experiencing a continued prostate specific antigen increase over 5 years was 61%, 67% and 74%, respectively, plateauing at 0.4 ng/ml. The strongest association between biochemical recurrence and systemic progression occurred using a single prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.4 ng/ml or greater (HR 36, R(2) 0.92).  Conclusions:   A prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.4 ng/ml or greater reflects the threshold at which a prostate specific antigen increase becomes durable and shows the strongest correlation with subsequent systemic progression.

Objective:   To examine the effect of different benefits and harms presentations on patients' intentions to accept low-value or potentially low-value screening services (prostate cancer screening in men ages 50-69 years; osteoporosis screening in low-risk women ages 50-64 years; or colorectal cancer screening in men and women ages 76-85 years).  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized clinical trial of 775 individuals eligible to receive information about any 1 of the 3 screening services and scheduled for a visit with their clinician. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms that differed in terms of presentation format: words, numbers, numbers plus narrative, and numbers plus framed presentation. The trial was conducted from September 2012 to June 2014 at 2 family medicine and 2 internal medicine practices affiliated with the Duke Primary Care Research Consortium. The data were analyzed between May and September of 2015.  Interventions:   One-page evidence-based decision support sheets on each of the 3 screening services, with benefits and harms information presented in 1 of 4 formats: words, numbers, numbers plus narratives, or numbers plus a framed presentation.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was change in intention to accept screening (on a response scale from 1 to 5). Our secondary outcomes included general and disease-specific knowledge, perceived risk and consequences of disease, screening attitudes, perceived net benefit of screening, values clarity, and self-efficacy for screening.  Results:   We enrolled and randomly allocated 775 individuals, aged 50 to 85 years, to 1 of 4 intervention arms: 195 to words, 192 to numbers, 196 to narrative, and 192 to framed formats.

However, the adverse effect profiles of both ADT groups have never been compared.  Objective:   To provide a comparative effectiveness analysis of the adverse effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) vs bilateral orchiectomy in a homogeneous population.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort of 3295 men with metastatic PCa between January 1995 and December 2009 66 years or older was selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare-linked database.  Exposures:   Orchiectomy or GnRHa.  Main outcomes and measures:   Any fractures, peripheral arterial disease, venous thromboembolism, cardiac-related complications, diabetes mellitus, and cognitive disorders. To minimize treatment group biases, the inverse probability of treatment was weighted using the propensity score. Multivariable competing risk regression models were performed with the adjustment of all-cause mortality. Secondary analyses examined the effect of increasing duration of GnRHa treatment. Multivariable logistic regression models examined expenditures.  Results:   Overall, 3295 men with a primary diagnosis of metastatic PCa treated with GnRHa or orchiectomy were identified between years 1995 and 2009, and in adjusted analyses, patients who received a bilateral orchiectomy had significantly lower risks of experiencing any fractures (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94; P = .01), peripheral arterial disease (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.87; P = .004), and cardiac-related complications (HR, 0.74; 0.58-0.94; P = .01) compared with those treated with GnRHa. No statistically significant difference was noted between orchiectomy and GnRHa for diabetes and cognitive disorders. In individuals treated with GnRHa for 35 months or more, the increased risk for GnRHa compared with orchiectomy was noted for fractures (HR, 1.80), peripheral arterial disease (HR, 2.25), venous thromboembolism (HR, 1.52), cardiac-related complications (HR, 1.69), and diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.88) (P ≤ .01 for all).

Although sensitive to initial chemotherapy, SCLC rapidly develops resistance, leading to less effective second-line therapies. SCLC cells often overexpress Bcl-2, which protects cells from apoptosis both by sequestering pro-apoptotic family members and by modulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium signaling. BH3-mimetic agents such as ABT-263 disrupt the former activity but have limited activity in SCLC patients. Here we report for the first time that Bcl-2-IP3 receptor disruptor-2 (BIRD-2), a decoy peptide that binds to the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and prevents Bcl-2 interaction with IP3Rs, induces cell death in a wide range of SCLC lines, including ABT-263-resistant lines. BIRD-2-induced death of SCLC cells appears to be a form of caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by calpain activation. By targeting different regions of the Bcl-2 protein and different mechanisms of action, BIRD-2 and ABT-263 induce cell death synergistically. Based on these findings, we propose that targeting the Bcl-2-IP3R interaction be pursued as a novel therapeutic strategy for SCLC, either by developing BIRD-2 itself as a therapeutic agent or by developing small-molecule inhibitors that mimic BIRD-2.""","""['E F Greenberg', 'K S McColl', 'F Zhong', 'G Wildey', 'A Dowlati', 'C W Distelhorst']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['A synthetic peptide targeting the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma and follicular lymphoma cells alone or in combination with agents targeting the BH3-binding pocket of Bcl-2.', 'Assessment of ABT-263 activity across a cancer cell line collection leads to a potent combination therapy for small-cell lung cancer.', 'The ratio of Bcl-2/Bim as a predictor of cisplatin response provides a rational combination of ABT-263 with cisplatin or radiation in small cell lung cancer.', 'Targeting Bcl-2-IP3 receptor interaction to treat cancer: A novel approach inspired by nearly a century treating cancer with adrenal corticosteroid hormones.', 'A dual role for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in cancer: mitochondria versus endoplasmic reticulum.', ""Calcium's Role in Orchestrating Cancer Apoptosis: Mitochondrial-Centric Perspective."", 'Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane: Overview and inextricable link with cancer.', 'IP3 Receptor Biology and Endoplasmic\xa0Reticulum Calcium Dynamics in Cancer.', 'Bcl-2 Family of Proteins in the Control of Mitochondrial Calcium Signalling: An Old Chap with New Roles.', 'Network Analysis Identifies Drug Targets and Small Molecules to Modulate Apoptosis Resistant Cancers.']"""

To our knowledge, the incidence of long-term adverse health events has not been reported.  Objective:   To examine long-term late events in elderly patients randomized to intermittent or continuous ADT to determine whether late cardiovascular and endocrine events would be lower in patients treated with intermittent ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter clinical trial using linkage between patient data from S9346, a randomized SWOG trial of intermittent vs continuous ADT in men with metastatic PC, and corresponding Medicare claims.  Exposure:   Intermittent or continuous ADT.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcome was to identify long-term adverse health events by treatment arm. Patients were classified as having an adverse health event if they had any hospital claim--or at least 2 physician or outpatient claims at least 30 days apart--for any of the following diagnoses: ischemic and thrombotic events, endocrine events, sexual dysfunction, dementia, and depression. To incorporate time from beginning of observation through evidence of an event, we determined the cumulative incidence of each event. Competing risks Cox regression was used, adjusting for covariates.  Results:   In total, 1134 eligible US-based male patients with metastatic PC were randomized to continuous vs intermittent ADT in the S9346 trial. A total of 636 of trial participants (56%) had at least 1 year of continuous Medicare parts A and B coverage and no health maintenance organization participation. The median age was 71.3 years. The most common long-term events were hypercholesterolemia (31%) and osteoporosis (19%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of ischemic and thrombotic events differed by arm; 24% for continuous and 33%for intermittent ADT (hazard ratio, 0.69; P = .02). There were no statistically significant differences by arm in any other adverse health events.  Conclusions and relevance:   Contrary to our hypothesis that intermittent ADT would reduce long-term health-related events compared with continuous ADT, we found that older men assigned to intermittent ADT had no apparent reduction in bone, endocrine, or cognitive events and an increased incidence of ischemic and thrombotic events.

Methods:   Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to evaluate the gene expression levels of miR-125a-5p in eight prostate cancer cell lines and nine biopsy specimens from patients with prostate cancer. miR-125a-5p was genetically knocked down in prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and VCaP cells by lentiviral transduction. The effects of miR-125a-5p downregulation on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration were evaluated by MTT assay and transwell assay, respectively. Direct regulation of miR-125a-5p on its downstream targets, NAIF1, and apoptotic gene caspase-3 were evaluated through dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot, respectively. NAIF1 was then ectopically overexpressed in DU145 and VCaP cells to modulate prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, the effects of miR-125a-5p downregulation or NAIF1 overexpression on the growth of in vivo prostate cancer xenograft were evaluated.  Results:   miR-125a-5p was upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate carcinomas. Lentivirus induced miR-125a-5p downregulation in DU145 and VCaP cells inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation or migration. NAIF1 was the direct target of miR-125a-5p, as both gene and protein expression levels of NAIF1, as well as caspase-3 were upregulated by miR-125a-5p. Forced overexpression of NAIF1 had similar antitumor effects as miR-125a-5p downregulation on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.

Activity of the markers has been evaluated in: 39 BPH, 28 prostate cancer (PCa) and 10 castration resistant PCa (CRPCa) tissues. Possible association of intensity of the expression with the disease clinical parameters has been assessed. Activity of MDM2 was higher in PCa and CRPCa as compared with BPH. This difference has been detected in epithelial and vascular prostatic cells. Epithelial activity of Bcl-2 was significantly lower in BPH as compared with PCa and CRPCa. Conversely, intensity of pro-apoptotic protein Bax was significantly higher in PBH than in PCa and CRPCa. The Bax activity in acinar and ductal cells of BPH was positively correlated with age. Intensity of Bcl-2 was significantly increasing, while activity of Bax was decreasing with increasing prostate volume. Significant correlation has been detected with the markers' activity and residual urine. In particular, MDM2 activity was increasing while epithelial activity of Bax was decreasing with increasing residual urine. Serum PSA level was positively correlated with MDM2 and negatively correlated with Bax activity. p27(Kip1) cell cycle inhibitor was positively correlated with Bax but negatively correlated with Bcl-2 activities.

Specifically, this signature included elevated immunoglobulin expression by tumor-infiltrating B cells, NF-κB activation, and increased chemokine expression. In an alternate approach to characterize smoking-induced oncogenic alterations, we also explored the effects of nicotine in human prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer-prone TRAMP mice. These investigations showed that nicotine increased glutamine consumption and invasiveness of cancer cells in vitro and accelerated metastatic progression in tumor-bearing TRAMP mice.

STAMPEDE is a randomised controlled trial using a multiarm, multistage platform design. It recruits men with high-risk, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer who are starting first-line long-term hormone therapy. We report primary survival results for three research comparisons testing the addition of zoledronic acid, docetaxel, or their combination to standard of care versus standard of care alone.  Methods:   Standard of care was hormone therapy for at least 2 years; radiotherapy was encouraged for men with N0M0 disease to November, 2011, then mandated; radiotherapy was optional for men with node-positive non-metastatic (N+M0) disease. Stratified randomisation (via minimisation) allocated men 2:1:1:1 to standard of care only (SOC-only; control), standard of care plus zoledronic acid (SOC + ZA), standard of care plus docetaxel (SOC + Doc), or standard of care with both zoledronic acid and docetaxel (SOC + ZA + Doc). Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was given for six 3-weekly cycles, then 4-weekly until 2 years, and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) for six 3-weekly cycles with prednisolone 10 mg daily. There was no blinding to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. Pairwise comparisons of research versus control had 90% power at 2·5% one-sided α for hazard ratio (HR) 0·75, requiring roughly 400 control arm deaths. Statistical analyses were undertaken with standard log-rank-type methods for time-to-event data, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs derived from adjusted Cox models. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00268476) and ControlledTrials.com (ISRCTN78818544).  Findings:   2962 men were randomly assigned to four groups between Oct 5, 2005, and March 31, 2013. Median age was 65 years (IQR 60-71). 1817 (61%) men had M+ disease, 448 (15%) had N+/X M0, and 697 (24%) had N0M0. 165 (6%) men were previously treated with local therapy, and median prostate-specific antigen was 65 ng/mL (IQR 23-184). Median follow-up was 43 months (IQR 30-60). There were 415 deaths in the control group (347 [84%] prostate cancer). Median overall survival was 71 months (IQR 32 to not reached) for SOC-only, not reached (32 to not reached) for SOC + ZA (HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·79-1·11; p=0·450), 81 months (41 to not reached) for SOC + Doc (0·78, 0·66-0·93; p=0·006), and 76 months (39 to not reached) for SOC + ZA + Doc (0·82, 0·69-0·97; p=0·022). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect (for any of the treatments) across prespecified subsets. Grade 3-5 adverse events were reported for 399 (32%) patients receiving SOC, 197 (32%) receiving SOC + ZA, 288 (52%) receiving SOC + Doc, and 269 (52%) receiving SOC + ZA + Doc.  Interpretation:   Zoledronic acid showed no evidence of survival improvement and should not be part of standard of care for this population.

Fractalkine, also known as chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1), the only member recognized so far that belongs to the CX3C chemokine subfamily, was reported to participate in the molecular events that regulate cell adhesion, migration and survival of human prostate cancer cells. However, the relationship between CX3CL1 and EMT remains unknown. We treated DU145 and PC-3 cells with CX3CL1 under hypoxic conditions. The migration and invasion abilities of DU145 and PC-3 cells were detected by Transwell assays. Induction of EMT was verified by morphological changes in the DU145 and PC-3 cells and analysis of protein expression of EMT markers such as E-cadherin and vimentin. To identify the involved signaling pathway in CX3CL1-induced EMT, activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was measured using western blot analysis, and Slug expression was detected with or without an EGFR inhibitor prior to CX3CL1 treatment. Concentrations of soluble and total TGF-α in the CX3CL‑treated DU145 cells were detected by ELISA. Additionally, we determined the involvement of the TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway in CX3CL1‑induced EMT using RNA interference and specific inhibitors. CX3CL1 increased the migration and invasiveness of the DU145 and PC-3 cells, and resulted in characteristic alterations of EMT. Our results demonstrated that TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway activation and subsequent upregulation of Slug expression were responsible for CX3CL1‑induced EMT, and contributed to the migration and inva-sion of prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of TACE/TGF-α/EGFR signaling reversed EMT and led to reduced migration and invasion abilities of the prostate cancer cells. We provide initial evidence that CX3CL1 exposure resulted in EMT occurrence and enhancement of cell migration and invasion through a mechanism involving activation of TACE/TGF-α/EGFR signaling. These findings revealed that CX3CL1 may serve as a new target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Jiebing Tang', 'Lijie Xiao', 'Rongjun Cui', 'Dong Li', 'Xiulan Zheng', 'Lijuan Zhu', 'Hui Sun', 'Yujia Pan', 'Yandan Du', 'Xiaoguang Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['ADAM17 targets MMP-2 and MMP-9 via EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway activation to promote prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Resveratrol suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer through TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway mediated Snail/E-cadherin expression.', 'MicroRNA-124 regulates TGF-α-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Aberrant Activation Mechanism of TGF-β Signaling in Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'A systematic pan-cancer analysis reveals the clinical prognosis and immunotherapy value of C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1).', 'CX3CL1 induces cell migration and invasion through ICAM-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'ADAM17 Mediates Hypoxia-Induced Keratinocyte Migration via the p38/MAPK Pathway.', 'Chemokine Receptor Antagonists: Role in Oncology.']"""

Survivin, an apoptosis inhibitor, has been found to be involved in the progression of PCa, and is a promising candidate target for CRPC therapy. Micro (mi)RNAs are involved in the progression of PCa through the regulation of multiple genes. One of the objectives of the present study was to investigate the effect of miRNA (miR)‑494 on the expression of survivin, as well as on PCa growth. The present study also aimed to assess whether co-transfecting miR‑494 with survivin short hairpin (sh)RNA has synergistic effects on suppressing PCa proliferation or the expression of survivin. Gene Expression Omnibus datasets with clinical PCa miRNA expression profiles were utilized to analysis the expression of miR‑494 in Ca, compared with normal prostate samples. PC3 cells, a CRPC cell line, were transfected with either an miR‑494 expression adenovirus, a survivin shRNA adenovirus or the two together, to examine their effect on PCa growth and the expression of survivin in vitro and in vivo. miR‑494 was downregulated in PCa tissue samples and in the PC‑3 cell line. miR‑494 targeted survivin at the translational level in PCa. Overexpression of miR‑494 and silencing survivin RNA through the use of survivin shRNA inhibited the expression of survivin and attenuated PC‑3 cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Notably, co‑transfecting miR‑494 with survivin shRNA had synergistic effects on suppressing prostate cancer proliferation via further suppression of the expression of survivin.

In the present study, we found that miR-340 may act as a tumor suppressor based on our finding that it was significantly downregulated in PCa tumor tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the expression of miR-340 was found to be correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and had a suppressive effect on tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model as well. The suppressive effect of miR-340 overexpression was observed in cell lines DU145 and BPH-1 which express wild-type (WT) p53. However, in the p53-null PC-3 cell line, the suppressive effect was not found, indicating that miR-340 may play a critical role in the p53 pathway. Further investigation revealed that mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), an important regulator of p53, was targeted by miR-340 through the direct binding to the 3'UTR of MDM2, which inhibited MDM2 translation. In addition, miR-340 expression stabilized p53 protein levels which caused an increase in p21 expression but a decrease in the anti‑apoptotic protein, BCL-2, in the p53 WT cell lines. Moreover, the miR-340-mediated inhibition of cell progression was mitigated by re-expressing MDM2 in the stable miR‑340-overexpressing PCa cell line, which harbors WT p53. Our findings suggest that miR-340 may function as a novel tumor suppressor in PCa through the MDM2-p53 pathway by directly targeting MDM2, which may be a promising miRNA-targeted therapy for PCa.""","""['Kai Huang', 'Yuxin Tang', 'Leye He', 'Yingbo Dai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['microRNA-1827 represses MDM2 to positively regulate tumor suppressor p53 and suppress tumorigenesis.', 'Mir-660 is downregulated in lung cancer patients and its replacement inhibits lung tumorigenesis by targeting MDM2-p53 interaction.', 'The role of miR-18b in MDM2-p53 pathway signaling and melanoma progression.', 'MicroRNA Control of p53.', 'Roles of TP53 in determining therapeutic sensitivity, growth, cellular senescence, invasion and metastasis.', 'Aglianico Grape Seed Semi-Polar Extract Exerts Anticancer Effects by Modulating MDM2 Expression and Metabolic Pathways.', 'The Role of NcRNAs to Regulate Immune Checkpoints in Cancer.', 'Overexpression of miR-340 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of human bladder cancer via targeting Glut-1.', 'SChLAP1 promotes prostate cancer development through interacting with EZH2 to mediate promoter methylation modification of multiple miRNAs of chromosome 5 with a DNMT3a-feedback loop.', 'miR-340: A multifunctional role in human malignant diseases.']"""

We present our procedure of TAMIS for extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) (Holm et al. in Br J Surg 94:232-238, 2007).  Methods:   The patient had a rectal cancer located 4 cm from the anal verge with suspected invasion of the levator ani (cT4bN0M0). A skin incision was made around the tightly closed anus, and a GelPOINT device was placed. The fat tissue of the ischioanal fossa was divided until the levator ani muscle was widely exposed. Anterior dissection was performed just behind the transverse perineal muscle, and the arms of the puborectalis sling were identified at 1 and 11 o'clock. The levator muscle was divided from the posterior to bilateral sides, and dissection was entered into the mesorectal plane. Posterior dissection was performed until the sacral promontory was reached. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o'clock positions, and special care was taken to preserve them. At the anterior side, the arms of the puborectalis sling and perineal body were divided. Special care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injury to the anterior tissues (urethra or prostate) because the dissection tends to go toward the anterior-lateral side of the prostate in this approach. Once the dissection plane behind the prostate was established, it was easy to dissect the mesorectum circumferentially while preserving the pelvic autonomic nerves. Vascular division, mobilization of left colon and stoma creation were performed laparoscopically.  Results:   This approach provides better exposure of the surgical field, especially at the anterior side, compared with the conventional perineal approach of ELAPE. Since January 2014, we have performed seven cases using this procedure. There was no conversion to the conventional approach, and no major complication was encountered.

Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of variables on the model.  Results:   Of the 27 cancer sites, the optimal number of fractions for the first course of radiotherapy ranged from 0 to 23.3 per cancer patient, and 1.5 to 29.1 per treatment course. Brain, prostate and head and neck cancers had the highest average number of fractions per course. Overall, the optimal number of fractions was 9.4 per cancer patient (range 8.7-10.0) and 19.4 per course (range 18.0-20.7).

Among the PDE5I users, a strategy for PDE5I use (on-demand vs. rehabilitation), timing of initiating PDE5I treatment following RP, duration of PDE5I use, and type of PDE5I used were not associated with an increased BCR risk in multivariate analyses (p = 0.304, p = 0.177, p = 0.332, and p = 0.105, respectively). In addition, PDE5I use was not associated with an increased risk of BCR among 478 matched cohorts (p = 0.672).  Conclusions:   PDE5I treatment following RP was not found to have any significant impact on biochemical outcome regardless of therapeutic strategy, timing, duration, and drug type. Such findings suggest that PDE5I treatment following RP is oncologically safe.""","""['Jung Ki Jo', 'Kwangmo Kim', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Jung Keun Lee', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sung Kyu Hong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Is there a relationship between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Effect of Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitor on Biochemical Recurrence Following Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitor Use and Disease Recurrence After Prostate Cancer Treatment.', ""Let's rethinking about the safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in the patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy."", 'Erectile Dysfunction Medications and Skin Cancer: An Analysis in US Veterans.', 'Sildenafil Citrate and Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radiation Therapy: Post-Hoc Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Safety and Efficacy of OGT-Assisted Overlap Oesophagojejunostomy Versus the Traditional Overlap Method in Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy for Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction (G/GEJ) Tumours.', 'Optimal Lymph Node Staging System in Evaluating Prognosis of Gallbladder Carcinoma: A Multi-institutional Study.', 'Is there a relationship between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The present study demonstrated that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SET8 inhibited the invasive potential of the PCa cell line PC-3 in vitro. Knockdown of SET8 reduced sphere formation, downregulated E-cadherin and α-catenin, and upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression in CaP cells, while upregulation of SET8 expression with a recombinant plasmid had the opposite effect. Furthermore, SET8 was shown to be physically associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in PCa cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that SET8 binds to the promoter of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and vimentin. Luciferase reporter assays suggested that E-cadherin and vimentin are direct targets of SET8; furthermore, loss- and gain-of function studies of SET8 and ZEB1 indicated that suppression of downstream E-cadherin and activation of vimentin are important mechanisms by which SET8 and ZEB1 cooperatively trigger metastasis. Furthermore, SET8-induced methylated H4K20 was indicated to exert a dual function in ZEB1-regulated gene expression.

So far there have been no reports focusing on the details of TUC. We focused on the clinical background and related causes in cases of TUC in our institution.  Patients and methods:   We identified 76 cases (65 patients) who underwent TUC at Keio University Hospital between April 2001 and March 2011. We focused on patient background, especially with respect to the primary disease, treatment modality, use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent, timing of TUC, type of electrosurgical device, and the incidence of transfusion.  Results:   The primary disease for TUC included bladder tumor (BT) in 31 cases, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in 13, prostate cancer (PCa) in 13, idiopathic bladder bleeding in 4, periarteritis nodosa in 3, uterine cervical cancer in 3, and others in 9. TUC after transurethral resection (TUR) was found in 38 cases, including transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in 26 of 31 BT cases and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in 12 of 13 BPH cases. After TURBT, TUC was performed before removal of a urethral catheter in 7 cases, and after removal of a urethral catheter in 19 cases. With regard to TUC associated with TURP, the average estimated prostate volume in TUC cases before removal of the urethral catheter was 66.2 ml, which was significantly larger than that in TUC cases after removal of the urethral catheter (46.1 ml, p = 0.045). TUC after the radiation therapy was observed in 21 cases, and the average time from the radiation therapy to TUC was 3.4 years (7 months-10 years).  Conclusion:   TUC was caused by multiple causes or disorders, and 75% of our TUC was associated with BT, BPH or PCa. TUC associated with TURBT frequently occurred within 1 week after TURBT but was still observed after 1 month following the operation. All TUC associated with TURP occurred within 3 weeks after operation. The average period from radiation therapy to TUC was 3.4 years (7 months-10 years) and TUC associated with radiation cystitis could occur beyond 5 years after radiation.""","""['Masahiro Katsui', 'Eiji Kikuchi', 'Satoshi Yazawa', 'Masayuki Hagiwara', 'Shinya Morita', 'Kazunobu Shinoda', 'Takeo Kosaka', 'Ryuichi Mizuno', 'Toshiaki Shinojima', 'Hiroshi Asanuma', 'Akira Miyajima', 'Mototsugu Oya']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Randomized study of transurethral resection of the prostate and combined transurethral resection and vaporization of the prostate as a therapeutic alternative in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Oncological safety and quality of life in men undergoing simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumor and prostate: results from a randomized controlled trial.', 'Simultaneous treatment for benign prostate hyperplasia and its concomitant diseases.', 'Electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate and transurethral incision of the prostate (monopolar techniques).', 'Safety and Efficacy of Thulium Laser Prostatectomy Versus Transurethral Resection of Prostate for Treatment of Benign Prostate Hyperplasia: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

These biopsies often fail to diagnose prostate cancer since 90% of cores are histopathologically classified as benign. The concentrations of endogenous fluorophores in prostate tissue vary with disease states. Thus, fluorescence spectroscopy could be utilized to quantify these variations for identification of malignant lesions. We investigated clinical feasibility of a 14 gauge (1.98 mm) optical biopsy needle guided by fluorescence spectroscopy for real-time in vivo prostate cancer diagnosis. Built-in optical sensor has 8×100μm fibers for tissue excitation and a single 200μm fiber to collect spectral data. Custom-made fluorometer has 2 light-emitting diodes at 290 and 340 nm and a spectrometer. User interface for fluorometer operation and data collection was developed using LabView software. Each spectral data acquisition required ~2 seconds. The in vivo biopsies were performed during radical retropubic prostatectomy surgery on the exposed prostate with blood flow to the gland intact. A tissue biopsy core was obtained from each biopsy site after acquisition of spectral data. Above procedure was repeated ex vivo after surgical excision of the prostate. Biopsy cores were histopathologically classified as either benign or malignant and correlated with corresponding spectral data. Partial Least Square analysis was performed to determine diagnostically significant principal components as potential classifiers. A linear support vector machine and leave-one-out cross validation method was employed for tissue classification. Thirteen patients were consented to the study. Histopathological analysis found cancer in 29/208 in vivo and 51/224 ex vivo viable biopsy cores. Study results show 72% sensitivity, 66% specificity, and 93% negative predictive value for in vivo and 75%, 80%, and 93%, respectively, for ex vivo malignant versus benign prostatic tissue classification. Optical biopsy needle has a very high negative predictive value to indicate benign tissue while sufficient sensitivity for targeting areas suspicious for cancer within the prostate gland. Hence, the optical biopsy needle can increase the diagnostic yield of prostate biopsies with consequent improvement in patient care.""","""['Priya N Werahera', 'Edward A Jasion', 'Yongjun Liu', 'John W Daily', 'Paul Arangua', 'Clifford Jones', 'S Russell Nash', 'Michael Morrell', 'E David Crawford']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Systematic diagnosis of prostate cancer using an optical biopsy needle adjunct with fluorescence spectroscopy.', 'Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can differentiate high grade and low grade prostatic carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer polar localization on core biopsy predicts pathologic stage.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.']"""

Design, Patients, Settings: A total of 611 subjects, including 343 infertile patients, 197 normozoospermic controls, and 71 cryptorchid newborns, were retrospectively selected.  Methods:   Sequencing analysis for rs2274911 polymorphism and F464Y mutation, and serum levels of FSH, LH, and T were assessed. In vitro functional studies for rs2274911 and F464Y were also performed.  Results:   Homozygous subjects for the risk allele A of rs2274911 had a 4.60-fold increased risk of oligozoospermia and 3.52-fold increased risk of cryptorchidism. A significant trend for increased levels of LH in the GA and AA genotypes, compared with GG homozygotes, was detected in men with azoospermia/cryptozoospermia (P for trend = .027), further supporting an association with primary testicular failure. The mutation F464Y was found in one cryptorchid child (one in 71; 1.41%). Functional studies showed that the A allele of rs2274911 and the F464Y substitution were associated with lower exposition of the receptor on the cell membrane and a reduced downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with respect to wild type.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that GPRC6A inactivation or sub-function contributes to reduced exposure to androgens, leading to cryptorchidism during fetal life and/or low sperm production in adulthood.""","""['Luca De Toni', 'Andrea Di Nisio', 'Elena Speltra', 'Maria Santa Rocca', 'Marco Ghezzi', 'Daniela Zuccarello', 'Nunzio Turiaco', 'Alberto Ferlin', 'Carlo Foresta']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['The rs2274911 polymorphism in GPRC6A gene is associated with insulin resistance in normal weight and obese subjects.', 'rs2274911 polymorphism in GPRC6A associated with serum E2 and PSA in a Southern Chinese male population.', 'RS 2247911 polymorphism of GPRC6A gene and serum undercarboxylated-osteocalcin are associated with testis function.', 'Hormonal evaluation in infertile men.', 'Molecular Pathology of Cryptorchidism-Induced Infertility.', 'Osteocalcin and the physiology of danger.', 'Bone-Derived Modulators That Regulate Brain Function: Emerging Therapeutic Targets for Neurological Disorders.', 'Skeletal endocrinology: where evolutionary advantage meets disease.', 'Explaining Divergent Observations Regarding Osteocalcin/GPRC6A Endocrine Signaling.', 'Chronic exercise training attenuates prostate cancer-induced molecular remodelling in the testis.']"""

We determined selected fluorescence properties of the free (unencapsulated) drug vs. valrubicin incorporated into rHDL nanoparticles. We have found that upon encapsulation into rHDL nanoparticles the quantum yield of valrubicin fluorescence increased six fold while its fluorescence lifetime increased about 2 fold. Accordingly, these and potassium iodide (KI) quenching data suggest that upon incorporation, valrubicin is localized deep in the interior of the nanoparticle, inside the lipid matrix. Fluorescence anisotropy of the rHDL valrubicin nanoparticles was also found to be high along with extended rotational correlation time. The fluorescence of valrubicin could also be utilized to assess its distribution upon delivery to prostate cancer (PC3) cells.

Therefore, our objective was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying Kaiso-mediated PCa progression. Comparative analysis of miRNA arrays revealed that 13 miRNAs were significantly altered (> 1.5 fold, p < 0.05) in sh-Kaiso PC-3 compared to sh-Scr control cells. Real-time PCR validated that three miRNAs (9, 31, 636) were increased in sh-Kaiso cells similar to cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. miR-31 expression negatively correlated with Kaiso expression and with methylation of the miR-31 promoter in a panel of PCa cell lines. ChIP assays revealed that Kaiso binds directly to the miR-31 promoter in a methylation-dependent manner. Over-expression of miR-31 decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness of PC-3 cells, whereas cells transfected with anti-miR-31 restored proliferation, migration and invasiveness of sh-Kaiso PC-3 cells. In PCa patients, Kaiso high/miR-31 low expression correlated with worse overall survival relative to each marker individually.

Recently, triptolide was found to induce autophagy in cancer cells. However, the effects of triptolide on autophagy in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells have not yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that triptolide induces autophagy in three PCa cell lines, PC-3, LNCaP and C4-2. Furthermore, we found that triptolide mediates intracellular accumulation of free calcium by stimulating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This activates the CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway, which in turn inhibits mTOR and activates both ULK1 and Beclin 1, finally resulting in autophagy. Moreover, we found that treatment with autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ) enhances triptolide-induced PCa cell death and growth inhibition. Using a PC-3-xenografted mouse model, we showed that blocking autophagy with CQ significantly promoted triptolide-induced tumor growth inhibition in vivo.

Despite this knowledge, their physiologic origins remain poorly understood. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be recruited from the bone marrow to areas of tissue damage and inflammation, including prostate cancer. MSCs can generate and have many overlapping properties with CAFs in preclinical models.  Methods:   Multiparameter flow cytometry and multipotent differentiation assays used to define MSCs in primary prostate stromal cultures derived from young (<25 yrs) organ donors and prostate cancer patients compared with bone marrow-derived stromal cultures. Population doubling times, population doublings, cell size, and differentiation potential determined under multiple culture conditions, including normoxia, hypoxia, and a variety of media. TGF-β measured by ELISA.  Results:   MSCs and stromal progenitors are not only present in normal and malignant prostate tissue, but are quickly selected for in primary stromal cultures derived from these tissues; becoming the dominant population within just a few passages. Growth potential inversely associated with TGF-β concentrations. All conditions generated populations with an average cell diameter >15 µm. All cultures tested had the ability to undergo osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, but unlike bone marrow-derived MSCs, primary stromal cultures derived from normal prostate tissue lack adipogenic differentiation potential. In contrast, a subset of stromal cultures derived from prostate cancer patients retain the ability to differentiate into adipocytes; a property that is significantly suppressed under hypoxic conditions in both bone marrow- and prostate-derived MSCs.  Conclusions:   Primary prostate stromal cultures are highly enriched in cells with an MSC or stromal progenitor phenotype. The use of primary cultures such as these to study CAFs raises interesting implications when considering their overlapping properties. The lack of adipogenesis in stromal cultures derived from normal prostates suggests they have a lineage-restricted progenitor phenotype. The retention of adipogenic differentiation in cultures from a subset of prostate cancer patients suggests the active recruitment of less committed progenitors or MSCs from the bone marrow as a function of disease progression. This recruitment can potentially be exploited for prognostic purposes or a cell-based platform for the systemic delivery of cytotoxic agents to sites of prostate cancer.""","""['W Nathaniel Brennen', 'L Nelleke Kisteman', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['GRP78 secreted by tumor cells stimulates differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell infiltration during neoplastic transformation of the human prostate.', 'Comparative analysis of human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue under xeno-free conditions for cell therapy.', 'Endometrial stem/progenitor cells: the first 10 years.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells as a vector for the inflammatory prostate microenvironment.', 'Early Cell Cultures from Prostate Cancer Tissue Express Tissue Specific Epithelial and Cancer Markers.', 'Exosome in Crosstalk between Inflammation and Angiogenesis: A Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Stroke.', 'Biological, chemical and mechanical factors regulating migration and homing of mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Expansion and characterization of bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stromal cells in serum-free conditions.', 'Overcoming stromal barriers to immuno-oncological responses via fibroblast activation protein-targeted therapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   Using murine PTEN-null prostate epithelial cell line and human prostate carcinoma LNCaP (PTEN-mutant) models, nuclear and cytosolic AR levels were determined by immunoblot analysis and the transcriptional activity of nuclear AR was assessed by RT-PCR analysis of its target genes with or without irradiation. Cell survival was evaluated by clonogenic assay or sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay upon irradiation in the absence or presence of the AR antagonist enzalutamide.  Results:   PTEN loss resulted in upregulation of AR expression in a PDGF-D dependent manner and irradiation selectively increased the nuclear AR protein level and its activity in a murine cell model. When the functional significance of AR in cell survival was tested, treatment with enzalutamide resulted in radiosensitization of human LNCaP cells. Similarly to the murine model, PDGF-D overexpression increased the nuclear AR level and its transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. PDGF-D over-expression was associated with radioresistance and enzalutamide treatment effectively reversed PDGF-D-mediated radioresistance in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated that AR, a target of the PTEN and PDGF D-downstream signaling program, contributes to radiation resistance in human PCa cells.

In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the impact of the spill-in counts from the bladder on the quantitative evaluation of prostate cancer when using (18)F-Fluorcholine (FCH) PET and we propose a novel reconstruction-based correction method. Monte Carlo simulations of a modified version of the XCAT2 anthropomorphic phantom with (18)F-FCH biological distribution, variable bladder uptake and inserted prostatic tumours were used in order to obtain simulated realistic (18)F-FCH data. We evaluated possible variations of the measured tumour Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) for different values of bladder uptake and propose a novel correction by appropriately adapting image reconstruction methodology. The correction is based on the introduction of physiological background terms on the reconstruction, removing the contribution of the bladder to the final image. The bladder is segmented from the reconstructed image and then forward-projected to the sinogram space. The resulting sinograms are used as background terms for the reconstruction. SUV max and SUV mean could be overestimated by 41% and 22% respectively due to the accumulation of radiotracer in the bladder, with strong dependence on bladder-to-lesion ratio. While the SUVs measured under these conditions are not reliable, images corrected using the proposed methodology provide better repeatability of SUVs, with biases below 6%. Results also showed remarkable improvements on visual detectability. The spill-in counts from the bladder can affect prostatic SUV measurements of (18)F-FCH images, which can be corrected to less than 6% using the proposed methodology, providing reliable SUV values even in the presence of high radioactivity accumulation in the bladder.""","""['Jesús Silva-Rodríguez', 'Charalampos Tsoumpas', 'Inés Domínguez-Prado', 'Juan Pardo-Montero', 'Álvaro Ruibal', 'Pablo Aguiar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Standardized uptake value-based evaluations of solitary pulmonary nodules using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/computed tomography.', 'Clinical implications of different image reconstruction parameters for interpretation of whole-body PET studies in cancer patients.', 'Quantification of FDG PET studies using standardised uptake values in multi-centre trials: effects of image reconstruction, resolution and ROI definition parameters.', 'Comparative assessment of methods for estimating tumor volume and standardized uptake value in (18)F-FDG PET.', 'Variability and uncertainty of 18F-FDG PET imaging protocols for assessing inflammation in atherosclerosis: suggestions for improvement.', 'SimPET-An open online platform for the Monte Carlo simulation of realistic brain PET data.

In this study, we determined the effect of 27-OHC in human prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1. We found that 27-OHC stimulates proliferation and increases androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity. 27-OHC also increased prostate-specific antigen expression and enhanced AR binding to the androgen response element compared to controls. Silencing AR expression with siRNA markedly reduced the 27-OHC-induced proliferation. Furthermore, 27-OHC blocked docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our results suggest that 27-OHC may play an important role in PCa and BPH progression by promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis.""","""['Shaneabbas Raza', 'Megan Meyer', 'Jared Schommer', 'Kimberly D P Hammer', 'Bin Guo', 'Othman Ghribi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer is associated with androgen receptor activation and loss of KDM5D expression.', 'Psoralea corylifolia L. extract ameliorates benign prostatic hyperplasia by regulating prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis.', '27-hydroxycholesterol decreases cell proliferation in colon cancer cell lines.', '27-hydroxycholesterol: A novel player in molecular carcinogenesis of breast and prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of reactive oxygen species in regulating 27-hydroxycholesterol-induced apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells and myeloid cell lines.', 'Our evolving understanding of how 27-hydroxycholesterol influences cancer.', 'MITOCHONDRIAL CHOLESTEROL AND CANCER.', 'Obesity and Cancer: 27-Hydroxycholesterol, the Missing Link.', 'Even Cancer Cells Watch Their Cholesterol!']"""

Methods:   Sixty-eight subjects with primary prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy or hormone therapy underwent whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography after injection of NMK36. The diagnostic performances of NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography were evaluated for (i) regional lymph node metastasis: comparison with contrast-enhanced computed tomography under setting reference standard (histopathology or 6-month follow-up), (ii) bone metastasis: concordance rate with conventional imaging (combination of bone scintigraphy and contrast-enhanced computed tomography) and (iii) primary lesion: comparison with histopathological findings.  Results:   The accuracy of NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography for regional lymph node metastasis were 85.5 and 87.3%, respectively. NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed positive findings for regional lymph nodes with short-axis diameters of 5-9 mm at 23 regions in 13 patients of hormone therapy cohort, but they were not confirmed with reference standard in this study. The concordance rate of NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography with conventional imaging for bone metastases was 83.3%, and seven patients had positive findings only by NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The sensitivity and specificity of NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography for primary lesion in six-segment analysis was 92.5 and 90.1%, respectively. Seven of non-serious adverse events were observed in six patients.  Conclusions:   This study showed the comparable diagnostic performance of NMK36-positron emission tomography/computed tomography compared with conventional imaging.

Recent studies indicate a general role of menin in carcinogenesis, affecting the prevalence and clinical course of common non-endocrine tumors such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. Here we report a new germline missense mutation of Men1 in a German family with atypical tumor phenotype over three generations. Based on the type of mutation, we discuss possible changes in menin function leading to atypical tumorigenesis and present the clinical significance of such findings.  Case presentation:   A German family with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism presented to our Hospital for further evaluation. Members of the family demonstrated many different atypical tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer. DNA sequencing from peripheral blood revealed a novel mutation: Ser38Cys [TCC>TGC] in exon 2, codon 38 of Men1. This novel mutation is located in a region of menin which is responsible for interactions with the transcription factor JunD. This factor has recently been associated with prostate cancer. DNA sequencing of two of the atypical tumors (prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer) did not reveal a loss of heterozygosity, indicating an impact on menin expression and function in the heterozygous state, in line with results in +/-Men1 mutant mice developing prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The results and clinical course of disease in this case indicate the potential role of menin in the development of non-endocrine or atypical-endocrine tumors in MEN1 patients. Further investigations are needed to clarify both the general role of menin and the importance of specific mutations in carcinogenesis.

However, there were no widely accepted methods predicting upgrading and upstaging PCa. In our study, we investigated the association between serum testosterone and upgrading or upstaging of PCa after radical prostatectomy (RP). We enrolled 167 patients with PCa with biopsy GS ≤6, clinical stage ≤T2c, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng ml-1 from April 2009 to April 2015. Data including age, body mass index, preoperative PSA level, comorbidity, clinical presentation, and preoperative serum total testosterone level were collected. Upgrading occurred in 62 (37.1%) patients, and upstaging occurred in 73 (43.7%) patients. Preoperative testosterone was lower in the upgrading than nonupgrading group (3.72 vs 4.56, P< 0.01). Patients in the upstaging group had lower preoperative testosterone than those in the nonupstaging group (3.84 vs 4.57, P= 0.01). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, as both continuous and categorical variables, low serum testosterone was confirmed to be an independent predictor of pathological upgrading (P = 0.01 and P= 0.01) and upstaging (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02) after RP. We suggest that low serum testosterone (<3 ng ml-1 ) is associated with a high rate of upgrading and upstaging after RP. It is better for surgeons to ensure close monitoring of PSA levels and imaging examination when selecting non-RP treatment, to be cautious in proceeding with nerve-sparing surgery, and to be enthusiastic in performing extended lymph node dissection when selecting RP treatment for patients with low serum testosterone.""","""['Yuan Gao', 'Chen-Yi Jiang', 'Shi-Kui Mao', 'Di Cui', 'Kui-Yuan Hao', 'Wei Zhao', 'Qi Jiang', 'Yuan Ruan', 'Shu-Jie Xia', 'Bang-Min Han']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Low serum total testosterone level as a predictor of upstaging and upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer patients meeting the inclusion criteria for active surveillance.', 'Utility of Gleason pattern 4 morphologies detected on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies for prediction of upgrading or upstaging in Gleason score 3\xa0+\xa04\xa0=\xa07 prostate cancer.', 'Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Optimal biopsy strategies for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Hypogonadism and urologic surgeries: a narrative review.', 'Low serum total testosterone level as a predictor of upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Endogenous testosterone density as ratio of endogenous testosterone levels on prostate volume predicts tumor upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Hypogonadism and prostate cancer detection on multiparametric MRI and mpMRI-TRUS fusion biopsy.']"""

In addition, loss of Lamin A/C expression has been observed in several cancers, including breast cancer, and it has been found that Lamin A/C suppression may lead to cancer-like aberrations in nuclear morphology and aneuploidy. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Lamin A/C transcript variant quantification might be employed for the diagnosis of breast cancer.  Methods:   Newly designed TaqMan qRT-PCR assays for the analysis of Lamin A/C splice variants were validated and their use as biomarkers for the diagnosis of breast cancer was assessed using 16 normal breast tissues and 128 breast adenocarcinomas. In addition, the expression levels of the Lamin A/C transcript variants were measured in samples derived from seven other types of cancer.  Results:   We found that the expression level of Lamin C was significantly increased in the breast tumors tested, whereas the expression levels of Lamin A and Lamin AΔ50 were significantly decreased. No significant change in Lamin AΔ10 expression was observed. Our data also indicated that the Lamin C : Lamin A mRNA ratio was increased in all clinical stages of breast cancer. Additionally, we observed increased Lamin C : Lamin A mRNA ratios in liver, lung and thyroid carcinomas and in colon, ovary and prostate adenocarcinomas.

Although thermoacoustic imaging with optical excitation has been commercialized for small animals, it has not yet made the transition to clinic for whole organ imaging in humans. The purpose of this work was to develop and validate specifications for a clinical ultrasound array for quantitative whole organ thermoacoustic imaging. Imaging a large organ requires exciting thermoacoustic pulses throughout the volume and broadband detection of those pulses because tomographic image reconstruction preserves frequency content. Applying the half-wavelength limit to a [Formula: see text] inclusion inside a 7.5-cm diameter organ requires measurement sensitivity to frequencies ranging from 4 MHz to 10 kHz, respectively. A dual-transducer system utilizing a P4-1 array connected to a Verasonics V1 system as well as a focused single-element transducer sensitive to lower frequencies was developed. Very high-frequency (VHF) irradiation generated thermoacoustic pulses throughout a [Formula: see text] volume. In the VHF regime, electrical conductivity drives thermoacoustic signal production. Simultaneous acquisition of thermoacoustic pulses by both transducers enabled comparison of transducer performance. Data from the clinical array generated a stack of 96 images with a separation of 0.3 mm, whereas the single-element transducer imaged only in a single plane. In-plane resolution and quantitative accuracy were quantified at isocenter. The array provided volumetric imaging capability with superior resolution whereas the single-element transducer provided superior quantitative accuracy in axial images. Combining axial images from both transducers preserved resolution of the P4-1 array and improved image contrast. Neither transducer was sensitive to frequencies below 50 kHz, resulting in a dc offset and low-frequency shading over fields of view exceeding 15 mm. Fresh human prostates were imaged ex vivo and volumetric reconstructions reveal structures rarely seen in diagnostic images. In conclusion, quantitative whole-organ thermoacoustic tomography will be feasible by sparsely interspersing transducer elements sensitive to the low end of the ultrasonic range.""","""['Sarah K Patch', 'David Hull', 'William A See', 'George W Hanson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Volumetric thermoacoustic imaging over large fields of view.', 'Imaging of high-intensity focused ultrasound-induced lesions in soft biological tissue using thermoacoustic tomography.', 'Thermoacoustic contrast of prostate cancer due to heating by very high frequency irradiation.', 'Microwave thermoacoustic tomographic (MTT) imaging.', 'Prospects of photoacoustic tomography.']"""

Overexpression of JMJD2A resulted in the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in mice, demonstrating that JMJD2A can initiate prostate cancer development. Moreover, combined overexpression of JMJD2A and the ETS transcription factor ETV1, a JMJD2A-binding protein, resulted in prostate carcinoma formation in mice haplodeficient for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) tumor-suppressor gene. Additionally, JMJD2A cooperated with ETV1 to increase expression of yes associated protein 1 (YAP1), a Hippo pathway component that itself was associated with prostate tumor aggressiveness. ETV1 facilitated the recruitment of JMJD2A to the YAP1 promoter, leading to changes in histone lysine methylation in a human prostate cancer cell line. Further, YAP1 expression largely rescued the growth inhibitory effects of JMJD2A depletion in prostate cancer cells, indicating that YAP1 is a downstream effector of JMJD2A.

Compound 2 (amorfrutin C) showed comparably lower PPAR activation potential. Amorfrutin C exhibited striking antiproliferative effects for human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29 and T84), prostate cancer (PC-3), and breast cancer (MCF7) cells (IC50 values ranging from 8 to 16 μM in these cancer cell lines).

For HT-29 cells, compound 2 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and modulated protein expression of key cell cycle modulators. Amorfrutin C further induced apoptotic events in HT-29 cells, including caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, phosphatidylserine externalization, and formation of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistic studies revealed that 2 disrupts the mitochondrial integrity by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (IC50 0.6 μM) and permanent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, leading to increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification. Structure-activity-relationship experiments revealed the carboxylic acid and the hydroxy group residues of 2 as fundamental structural requirements for inducing these apoptotic effects.

As low-grade disease may not need active intervention, the ability to identify aggressive cancers on imaging could limit the need for prostate biopsies. We assessed the ability of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in pre-biopsy risk stratification of men with prostate cancer. One hundred and twenty men suspected to have prostate cancer underwent mpMRI (diffusion MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging) prior to biopsy. Twenty-six had cancer and were stratified into three groups based on GS: low grade (GS ≤ 6), intermediate grade (GS = 7) and high grade (GS ≥ 8).

The metabolite ratio [citrate/(choline + creatine)] and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of voxels were calculated for the PZ regions corresponding to the biopsy cores and compared with histology. The median metabolite ratios for low-grade, intermediate-grade and high-grade cancer were 0.29 (range: 0.16, 0.61), 0.17 (range: 0.13, 0.32) and 0.13 (range: 0.05, 0.23), respectively (p = 0.004). The corresponding mean ADCs (×10(-3) mm(2) /s) for low-grade, intermediate-grade and high-grade cancer were 0.99 ± 0.08, 0.86 ± 0.11 and 0.69 ± 0.12, respectively (p < 0.0001). The combined ADC and metabolite ratio model showed strong discriminatory ability to differentiate subjects with GS ≤ 6 from subjects with GS ≥ 7 with an area under the curve of 94%. These data indicate that pre-biopsy mpMRI may stratify PCa aggressiveness noninvasively. As the recent literature data suggest that men with GS ≤ 6 cancer may not need radical therapy, our data may help limit the need for biopsy and allow informed decision making for clinical intervention.

However, monotherapies have limited efficacy in improving outcomes and benefit only a subset of patients. Combination therapies targeting multiple pathways can augment an immune response to improve survival further. Here, we demonstrate that dual aOX40 (anti-CD134)/aCTLA-4 (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) immunotherapy generated a potent antigen-specific CD8 T-cell response, enhancing expansion, effector function, and memory T-cell persistence. Importantly, OX40 and CTLA-4 expression on CD8 T cells was critical for promoting their maximal expansion following combination therapy. Animals treated with combination therapy and vaccination using anti-DEC-205 (dendritic and epithelial cells, 205 kDa)-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) had significantly improved survival in a mammary carcinoma model. Vaccination with combination therapy uniquely restricted Th2-cytokine production by CD4 cells, relative to combination therapy alone, and enhanced IFNγ production by CD8 and CD4 cells. We observed an increase in MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α)/CCL3 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3], MIP-1β/CCL4, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and excreted)/CCL5, and GM-CSF production by CD8 and CD4 T cells following treatment. Furthermore, this therapy was associated with extensive tumor destruction and T-cell infiltration into the tumor. Notably, in a spontaneous model of prostate adenocarcinoma, vaccination with combination therapy reversed anergy and enhanced the expansion and function of CD8 T cells recognizing a tumor-associated antigen. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the addition of a vaccine with combined aOX40/aCTLA-4 immunotherapy augmented antitumor CD8 T-cell function while limiting Th2 polarization in CD4 cells and improved overall survival.""","""['Stefanie N Linch', 'Melissa J Kasiewicz', 'Michael J McNamara', 'Ian F Hilgart-Martiszus', 'Mohammad Farhad', 'William L Redmond']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Combined targeting of costimulatory (OX40) and coinhibitory (CTLA-4) pathways elicits potent effector T cells capable of driving robust antitumor immunity.', 'Ligation of the OX40 co-stimulatory receptor reverses self-Ag and tumor-induced CD8 T-cell anergy in vivo.', 'Agonist OX40 immunotherapy improves survival in glioma-bearing mice and is complementary with vaccination with irradiated GM-CSF-expressing tumor cells.', 'Targeting OX40 and OX40L for the treatment of autoimmunity and cancer.', 'Signaling through OX40 enhances antitumor immunity.', 'Novel tumor necrosis factor-related long non-coding RNAs signature for risk stratification and prognosis in glioblastoma.', 'Mechanistic studies of MALAT1 in respiratory diseases.', 'Analysis of the OX40/OX40L immunoregulatory axis combined with alternative immune checkpoint molecules in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Optimization of whole-cell vaccines with CpG/αOX40/cGAMP to strengthen the anti-tumor response of CD4+ T cells in melanomas.', 'Current Clinical Trial Landscape of OX40 Agonists.']"""

This requires a non-interactive interface permitting batch calculation with multiple computers.  Methods:   Data are extracted from the TomoTherapy(®) archive and processed using the computational task-management system GANGA. Doses are calculated for each fraction of radiotherapy using the daily megavoltage (MV) CT images. The calculated dose cube is saved as a digital imaging and communications in medicine RTDOSE object, which can then be read by utilities that calculate dose-volume histograms or dose surface maps. The rectum is delineated on daily MV images using an implementation of the Chan-Vese algorithm.  Results:   On a cluster of up to 117 central processing units, dose cubes for all fractions of 151 patients took 12 days to calculate. Outlining the rectum on all slices and fractions on 151 patients took 7 h. We also present results of the Hounsfield unit (HU) calibration of TomoTherapy MV images, measured over an 8-year period, showing that the HU calibration has become less variable over time, with no large changes observed after 2011.  Conclusion:   We have developed a system for automatic dose recalculation of TomoTherapy dose distributions. This does not tie up the clinically needed planning system but can be run on a cluster of independent machines, enabling recalculation of delivered dose without user intervention.

Lysine-specific demethylase 5D (KDM5D) is a male-specific histone demethylase that specifically demethylates di- and tri-methyl H3K4 at the start site of active gene. In this light, the aim of this study was to investigate isoform/transcript-specific expression profiles of KDM5D in three prostate cancer cell lines, Du-145, LNCaP, and PC3.  Methods:   Real-time PCR analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of different KDM5D transcripts in the prostate cell lines. A gene regulatory network was established to analyze the gene expression profile.  Results:   Significantly different expression levels of both isoforms were found among the three cell lines. Interestingly, isoform I was expressed in three cell lines while isoform III did only in DU-145. The expression levels of both isoforms were higher in DU-145 when compared to other cell lines (P<0.0001). The observed expression profile was determined by using regulatory network analyses.

Their design was based on the bombesin (BN) analogue, H2N-PEG2-[D-Tyr(6),β-Ala(11),Thi(13),Nle(14)]BN(6-14), which binds to GRPr with high affinity and specificity, and the peptidomimetic urea-based pseudoirreversible inhibitor of PSMA, Glu-ureido-Lys. The two pharmacophores were coupled through copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to the bis(tetrafluorophenyl) ester of the chelating agent HBED-CC via amino acid linkers made of positively charged His (H) and negatively charged Glu (E): -(HE)n- (n = 0-3). The BRLs were labeled with (68)Ga, and their preliminary pharmacological properties were evaluated in vitro (competitive and time kinetic binding assays) on prostate cancer (PC-3, LNCaP) and rat pancreatic (AR42J) cell lines and in vivo by biodistribution and small animal PET imaging studies in both normal and tumor-bearing mice. The IC50/Ki values determined for all BRLs essentially matched those of the respective monomers. The maximal cellular uptake of the BLRs was observed between 20 and 30 min. The BRLs showed a synergistic ability in vivo by targeting both PSMA (LNCaP) and GRPr (PC-3) positive tumors, whereas the charged -(HE)n- (n = 1-3) linkers significantly reduced the kidney and spleen uptake.

We evaluated the effect of the endorectal balloon (ERB) on rectal dosimetry, specifically the absolute volume of rectum receiving high dose.  Methods and materials:   Eleven patients with localized prostate cancer underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy planning with computed tomography simulation with and without a RadiaDyne ERB inflated with 60 mL of water. Prescription dose was 3625 cGy in 5 fractions of 725 cGy. The V3600 (volume receiving 3600 cGy), V3440 (volume receiving 3440 cGy), and volume receiving 50% of the prescription dose were calculated for both the rectum and rectal wall. Repeat plans were generated using smaller planning target volume margins (reduced to 1 mm from 3 mm posteriorly) and after virtually replacing the water-filled ERB with air equivalent density. Comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   The rectal V3600 and V3440 were significantly lower without ERB than with water-filled ERB using standard 3-mm posterior margin (P = .003 for both V3600/V3440), water-filled ERB using reduced 1-mm posterior margin (P = .016 and .003), or air-filled ERB (P = .003 and .004). Regarding the rectal wall, V3600 and V3440 were also significantly lower without ERB than with any ERB, except when using the water-filled ERB with reduced posterior margin (P = .328). The volumes of rectum and rectal wall receiving lower dose (volume receiving 50% of the prescription dose) were not significantly greater without the ERB.  Conclusion:   We found an increase in the volume of rectum and rectal wall receiving high dose radiation utilizing an ERB.

Multiple transcription factors can be impacted downstream of primary target inhibition, thus making it challenging to understand the driving mechanism of action of pharmacologic inhibition of chromatin modifying proteins. This in turn makes it difficult to identify biomarkers predictive of response and pharmacodynamic tools to optimize drug dosing. In this report, we show that (89)Zr-transferrin, an imaging tool we developed to measure MYC activity in cancer, can be used to identify cancer models that respond to broad spectrum inhibitors of transcription primarily due to MYC inhibition. As a proof of concept, we studied inhibitors of BET bromodomain containing proteins, as they can impart antitumor effects in a MYC dependent or independent fashion. In vitro, we show that transferrin receptor biology is inhibited in multiple MYC positive models of prostate cancer and double hit lymphoma when MYC biology is impacted. Moreover, we show that bromodomain inhibition in one lymphoma model results in transferrin receptor expression changes large enough to be quantified with (89)Zr-transferrin and positron emission tomography (PET) in vivo. Collectively, these data further underscore the diagnostic utility of the relationship between MYC and transferrin in oncology, and provide the rationale to incorporate transferrin-based PET into early clinical trials with bromodomain inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors.""","""['Michael G Doran', 'Kathryn E Carnazza', 'Jeffrey M Steckler', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Charles Truillet', 'John Wongvipat', 'Charles L Sawyers', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Michael J Evans']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Noninvasive 89Zr-Transferrin PET Shows Improved Tumor Targeting Compared with 18F-FDG PET in MYC-Overexpressing Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Annotating MYC status with 89Zr-transferrin imaging.', 'AZD5153: A Novel Bivalent BET Bromodomain Inhibitor Highly Active against Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Targeting BET bromodomains for cancer treatment.', 'Bromodomain-containing proteins in prostate cancer.', 'Rationale for MYC imaging and targeting in pancreatic cancer.', 'Preclinical Advances in Theranostics for the Different Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer.', 'Targeting iron metabolism in high-grade glioma with 68Ga-citrate PET/MR.', 'A PET Imaging Strategy for Interrogating Target Engagement and Oncogene Status in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Noninvasive 89Zr-Transferrin PET Shows Improved Tumor Targeting Compared with 18F-FDG PET in MYC-Overexpressing Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.']"""

However, their relations and patterns of expression in primary and metastatic lymph node (LN) PCAs are not fully explored.  Methods:   A tissue microarray of matched primary PCA and LN metastasis was constructed from 36 patients. SPINK1, ERG, and PTEN expression statuses were assessed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with each other.  Results:   SPINK1 and ERG were expressed in 25% and 42.7% of primary PCA cases, respectively. PTEN loss of any degree was observed in 91.7% of primary PCA cases, with 54.2% showing complete loss. In primary PCA, 12.5% of the cases showed SPINK1+/ERG-phenotype, 16.7% showed SPINK1+/ERG+phenotype, 25.0% showed SPINK1-/ERG+phenotype, and 45.8% showed SPINK1-/ERG-phenotype. All PCAs with expression of either SPINK1 or ERG also exhibited PTEN loss, whereas PCA without PTEN loss (2 cases) expressed neither SPINK1 nor ERG. In primary PCA, evaluation of combined ERG and SPINK1 status, but not SPINK1 individually, was associated with a significant difference in proportion of Gleason patterns (P = 0.013), with the SPINK1+/ERG+and SPINK1-/ERG-phenotypes represented more in Gleason pattern>7 PCAs. In LN metastases, the overall SPINK1 protein expression frequency was significantly lower (6.5% of cases) compared with primary PCA (P = 0.03). Only 16.7% of cases with positive SPINK1 expression in primary PCA maintained expression in LN metastases. The down-regulated SPINK1 expression in LN was primarily because of a reduction in the SPINK1+/ERG+PCA subpopulation to 3.5% of cases (P = 0.16 compared with primary PCA). The frequencies of ERG expression and PTEN loss were relatively stable in primary PCA and LN metastases.  Conclusion:   SPINK1 expression is dynamically regulated with up-regulation in primary sites of nodal metastatic PCA and down-regulation in LN metastases. The increased SPINK1 expression in primary site of nodal metastatic PCA is secondary to an increased frequency of SPINK1+/ERG+tumors. In primary PCAs, the SPINK1+/ERG+phenotype is associated with higher Gleason grade, suggesting that this phenotype may mark a more aggressive PCA subpopulation with higher risk of LN metastases.""","""['Kuo-Cheng Huang', 'Louis R Bégin', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Bryan Donnelly', 'Tarek A Bismar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['SPINK1 Overexpression in Localized Prostate Cancer: a Rare Event Inversely Associated with ERG Expression and Exclusive of Homozygous PTEN Deletion.', 'The expression profile and prognostic value of SPINK1 in initially diagnosed bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Prostate cancer SubtyPINg biomarKers and outcome: is clarity emERGing?', 'The Association between Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 Associated Protein 1 (CDK2AP1) and Molecular Subtypes of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Loss of KLK4::KLKP1 pseudogene expression by RNA chromogenic in-situ hybridization is associated with PTEN loss and increased risk of biochemical recurrence in a cohort of middle eastern men with prostate cancer.', 'SPINKs in Tumors: Potential Therapeutic Targets.', 'ARPC1B Is Associated with Lethal Prostate Cancer and Its Inhibition Decreases Cell Invasion and Migration In Vitro.', 'Decreased ATM Protein Expression Is Substantiated with PTEN Loss in Defining Aggressive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Associated with Lethal Disease.']"""

We examined differences in diagnosis, management, and survival of AAPI ethnic groups, relative to their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts.  Methods:   Patients (n = 891,100) with PCa diagnosed between 1988 and 2010 within the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database were extracted and stratified by ethnic group: Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian/Pakistani, PI, and Other Asian. The effect of ethnic group on stage at presentation, rates of definitive treatment, and PCa-specific mortality was assessed. The severity at diagnosis was defined as: localized (TxN0M0), regional (TxN1M0), or metastatic (TxNxM1).  Results:   Relative to NHWs, Asian Indian/Pakistani, Filipino, Hawaiian, and PI men had significantly worse outcomes. Filipino (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.27-1.51), Hawaiian, (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.41-2.04), Asian Indian/Pakistani (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.64), and PI men (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.46-2.49) were more likely to present with metastatic PCa (P<0.001).

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 27 consecutive patients who developed colitis after treatment with ipilimumab infusion therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer or metastatic melanoma, from April 2007 through September 2012. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic information was collected from the database of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Selected cases were ascertained by cross-checking with endoscopy reports.  Results:   All patients had diarrhea (range, 3-20 stools per day); 26% had concurrent rectal blood loss and 30% had abdominal pain. These symptoms usually started after 2 infusions of ipilimumab (range, 1-4) and all patients except for 1 (who received no treatment for colitis) were given corticosteroids. Twelve patients had steroid-refractory colitis, for which they received infliximab (5 mg/kg). Diarrhea resolved in all the patients. Colon erythema was detected by endoscopy in 84% of patients, with an absent vascular pattern in all patients. In histologic analyses, colon biopsy specimens ranged from having normal architecture to severe active inflammation. Intraepithelial neutrophilic leucocytes were detected in 72% of samples, cryptitis in 92%, and crypt abscesses in 60%. Crypt irregularities were found in 40% of colon biopsy specimens, indicating chronic disease.

Here, we report that the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase JARID1D (also called KDM5D and SMCY), a male-specific protein, represses gene expression programs associated with cell invasiveness and suppresses the invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that JARID1D specifically repressed the invasion-associated genes MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, and Slug by demethylating trimethyl H3K4, a gene-activating mark, at their promoters. Our additional results demonstrated that JARID1D levels were highly downregulated in metastatic prostate tumors compared with normal prostate tissues and primary prostate tumors. Furthermore, the JARID1D gene was frequently deleted in metastatic prostate tumors, and low JARID1D levels were associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that an epigenetic modifier expressed on the Y chromosome functions as an anti-invasion factor to suppress the progression of prostate cancer.

Extensive research over the last 50 years has demonstrated that these polyphenols play an important role in the maintenance of health and prevention of diseases, in addition to its therapeutic benefits such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activities. Materials and methods This study is devoted to the enhancement of the solubility and bioavailability of curcumin nanoparticles prepared by a process based on a wet-milling technique and then examine in vitro against prostate cancer cell line 3 (PC3), human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK), human erythrocytes (red blood cells (RBCs)), and against fourth different bacterial strains two gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213), two gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Results The cell viability curve, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were evaluated. Nanocurcumin displayed significant activity against cancer cell line (PC3) and low toxicity against normal cells (HEK) compared with parent curcumin in favor of PC3 (P < 0.05). In addition, it was found that the efficiency of toxicity for nanocurcumin against PC3 (E% = 59.66%) was much better than HEK (E% = 36.07%) compared with parent curcumin. The results also demonstrate that, although nanocurcumin has a little more ability to lays RBCs than parent curcumin after incubated 60 min, but the hemolysis % remained very low and there was no significant difference between hemolysis % of nanocurcumin and parent curcumin (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the results demonstrate that, the MBCs of nanocurcumin were lower than curcumin for all different bacterial strains. Moreover, the selected gram-positive bacteria had higher sensitivity than the selected gram-negative bacteria for both curcumin and nanocurcumin. In conclusion, all these findings not only indicate that nanocurcumin safe compound has a potent ability as anti-cancer and antimicrobial activities, but also well justify the avail of using nanocurcumin as prostate cells PC3 anti-cancer, and antimicrobial agent for nanocurcumin are markedly improved by decreasing particle size to the nano-scale regime.""","""[""Mo'ath Ahmad Adahoun"", 'Mohammed-Ali Hassan Al-Akhras', 'Mohamad Suhaimi Jaafar', 'Mohamed Bououdina']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol""","""['Enhanced nanocurcumin toxicity against (PC3) tumor and microbial by using magnetic field in vitro.', 'Curcumin nanoparticles: preparation, characterization, and antimicrobial study.', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent apoptotic photocytotoxicity of solvent exchange-prepared curcumin nanoparticles.', 'Curcumin-Based Nanoformulations: A Promising Adjuvant towards Cancer Treatment.', 'Multifunctional polymeric nanocurcumin for cancer therapy.', 'The therapeutic potential of curcumin and its related substances in turmeric: From raw material selection to application strategies.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Advanced nanomaterial for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Double functionalized haemocompatible silver nanoparticles control cell inflammatory homeostasis.', 'Critical Review on Nutritional, Bioactive, and Medicinal Potential of Spices and Herbs and Their Application in Food Fortification and Nanotechnology.']"""

IHC expression patterns did not show correlation to survival data. PTOV1 RNA expression correlated with features of the luminal UC subtype.  Conclusions:   Subcellular distribution seems to be the most important feature of PTOV1 expression in UC. Nuclear localization of PTOV1 along with cytoplasmic decrease in PTOV1 expression was identified as putative surrogate for PTOV1-associated cellular proliferation and dedifferentiation in UC. The functional relevance as well as the potential role of PTOV1 as a biomarker in UC remains to be specified in future studies.""","""['Steffen Rausch', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Marcus Scharpf', 'Katharina Teepe', 'Ursula Kühs', 'Stefan Aufderklamm', 'Simone Bier', 'Johannes Mischinger', 'Georgios Gakis', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Tilman Todenhöfer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.', 'Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is characterized by overexpression of thymidine kinase 1.', 'Estimation of the diagnostic potential of APOD, PTOV1, and EPHA4 for prostatic neoplasms.', 'Prostate tumor overexpressed 1 is a novel prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma progression and overall patient survival.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'PTOV1 promotes cisplatin-induced chemotherapy resistance by activating the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in ovarian cancer.', 'High expression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) is a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.', 'Depleting PTOV1 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells to chemotherapy through attenuating cancer stem cell traits.', 'hnRNPK-regulated PTOV1-AS1 modulates heme oxygenase-1 expression via miR-1207-5p.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.']"""

Objective:   To estimate familial risk and heritability of cancer types in a large twin cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective study of 80,309 monozygotic and 123,382 same-sex dizygotic twin individuals (N = 203,691) within the population-based registers of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Twins were followed up a median of 32 years between 1943 and 2010. There were 50,990 individuals who died of any cause, and 3804 who emigrated and were lost to follow-up.  Exposures:   Shared environmental and heritable risk factors among pairs of twins.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcome was incident cancer. Time-to-event analyses were used to estimate familial risk (risk of cancer in an individual given a twin's development of cancer) and heritability (proportion of variance in cancer risk due to interindividual genetic differences) with follow-up via cancer registries. Statistical models adjusted for age and follow-up time, and accounted for censoring and competing risk of death.  Results:   A total of 27,156 incident cancers were diagnosed in 23,980 individuals, translating to a cumulative incidence of 32%. Cancer was diagnosed in both twins among 1383 monozygotic (2766 individuals) and 1933 dizygotic (2866 individuals) pairs. Of these, 38% of monozygotic and 26% of dizygotic pairs were diagnosed with the same cancer type. There was an excess cancer risk in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with cancer, with estimated cumulative risks that were an absolute 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) higher in dizygotic (37%; 95% CI, 36%-38%) and an absolute 14% (95% CI, 12%-16%) higher in monozygotic twins (46%; 95% CI, 44%-48%) whose twin also developed cancer compared with the cumulative risk in the overall cohort (32%). For most cancer types, there were significant familial risks and the cumulative risks were higher in monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Heritability of cancer overall was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%). Significant heritability was observed for the cancer types of skin melanoma (58%; 95% CI, 43%-73%), prostate (57%; 95% CI, 51%-63%), nonmelanoma skin (43%; 95% CI, 26%-59%), ovary (39%; 95% CI, 23%-55%), kidney (38%; 95% CI, 21%-55%), breast (31%; 95% CI, 11%-51%), and corpus uteri (27%; 95% CI, 11%-43%).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this long-term follow-up study among Nordic twins, there was significant excess familial risk for cancer overall and for specific types of cancer, including prostate, melanoma, breast, ovary, and uterus.

Better biomarkers are needed to identify patients at the highest risk to guide therapy intensification.  Objective:   To create a DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathway profiling method for use as a prognostic signature biomarker in high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort of 1090 patients with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent prostatectomy and were treated at 3 different academic institutions were divided into a training cohort (n = 545) and 3 pooled validation cohorts (n = 232, 130, and 183) assembled for case-control or case-cohort studies. Profiling of 9 DDR pathways using 17 gene sets for GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) of high-density microarray gene expression data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy samples with median 10.3 years follow-up was performed. Prognostic signature development from DDR pathway profiles was studied, and DDR pathway gene mutation in published cohorts was analyzed.  Main outcomes and measures:   Biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival.  Results:   Across the training cohort and pooled validation cohorts, 1090 men were studied; mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 65.3 (6.4) years. We found that there are distinct clusters of DDR pathways within the cohort, and DDR pathway enrichment is only weakly correlated with clinical variables such as age (Spearman ρ [ρ], range, -0.07 to 0.24), Gleason score (ρ, range, 0.03 to 0.20), prostate-specific antigen level (ρ, range, -0.07 to 0.10), while 13 of 17 DDR gene sets are strongly correlated with androgen receptor pathway enrichment (ρ, range, 0.33 to 0.82). In published cohorts, DDR pathway genes are rarely mutated. A DDR pathway profile prognostic signature built in the training cohort was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival in the pooled validation cohorts independent of standard clinicopathological variables. The prognostic performance of the signature for metastasis-free survival appears to be stronger in the younger patients (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.12-2.50) than in the older patients (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.29-2.07) on multivariate Cox analysis.  Conclusions and relevance:   DNA damage and repair pathway profiling revealed patient-level variations and the DDR pathways are rarely affected by mutation.

Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) is involved in the damage recognition step during nucleotide excision repair. The relationship between XPC intron11 C/A polymorphism and cancer risk has not been widely studied. Hence, this study evaluated the relationship between the XPC intron11 C/A polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.  Materials and methods:   This hospital-based cohort consisted of 152 patients with prostate cancer and 142 male controls. The XPC intron11 C/A genotype was determined using the PCR-RFLP method. Medical, occupational, and cigarette-smoking history was obtained from each participant using questionnaires.  Results:   Logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to controls, the frequencies of the A/A and C/A genotypes were significantly higher than those of the C/C genotype in cancer patients (OR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.98 and OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.13-3.24, respectively). We also found that the frequency of the A/A genotype was significantly higher in cancer cases than in controls among non-smokers (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 1.38-42.88, compared to the C/C genotype).

However, LOY has been found in association with smoking, shorter survival and higher risk of cancer. It was suggested that LOY in blood cells could become a predictive biomarker of male carcinogenesis.  Aims, methods & findings:   To investigate the association of LOY in blood cells with the risk for development of colorectal (CC) and prostate cancers (PC), we have analyzed DNA samples from peripheral blood of 101 CC male patients (mean age 60.5±11.9 yrs), 70 PC patients (mean age 68.8±8.0 yrs) and 93 healthy control males (mean age 65.8±16.6 yrs). The methodology included co-amplification of homologous sequences on chromosome Y and other chromosomes using multiplex quantitative fluorescent (QF) PCR followed by automatic detection and analysis on ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer. The mean Y/X ratio was significantly lower in the whole group of cancer patients (0.907±0.12; p = 1.17x10-9) in comparison to the controls (1.015±0.15), as well as in CC (0.884±0.15; p = 3.76x10-9) and PC patients (0.941±0.06; p = 0.00012), when analyzed separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for LOY and age showed that LOY is a more significant predictor of cancer presence than age, and that age probably does not contribute to the increased number of subjects with detectable LOY in cancer patients cohort.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence rates of different types of cancer in Sulaymaniyah from January-2006 to January-2014. The data were compared with those reported for other middle east countries.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study depended on data collected from Hiwa hospital cancer registry unit, death records and histopathology reports in all Sulaymaniyah teaching hospitals, using international classification of diseases.  Results:   A total of 8,031 cases were registered during the eight year period, the annual incidence rate in all age groups rose from 38 to 61.7 cases/100,000 population/year, with averages over 50 in males and 50.7 in females. The male to female ratio in all age groups were 0.98, while in the pediatric age group it was 1.33. The hematological malignancies in all age groups accounted for 20% but in the pediatric group around half of all cancer cases. Pediatric cancers were occluding 7% of total cancers with rates of 10.3 in boys and 8.7 in girls. The commonest malignancies by primary site were leukemia, lymphoma, brain, kidney and bone. In males in all age groups they were lung, leukaemia, lymphoma, colorectal, prostate, bladder, brain, stomach, carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) and skin, while in females they were breast, leukaemia, lymphoma, colorectal, ovary, lung, brain, CUP, and stomach. Most cancers were increased with increasing age except breast cancer where decrease was noted in older ages. High mortality rates were found with leukemia, lung, lymphoma, colorectal, breast and stomach cancers.  Conclusions:   We here found an increase in annual cancer incidence rates across the period of study, because of increase of cancer with age and higher rates of hematological malignancies.

We here compared PSA kinetics with detection of bone marrow micrometastasis as methods to determine local or systemic relapse.  Materials and methods:   A transversal study was conducted of men with biochemical failure, defined as a serum PSA >0.2ng/ml after radical prostatectomy. Consecutive patients having undergone radical prostatectomy and with biochemical failure were enrolled and clinical and pathological details were recorded. Bone marrow biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest and touch prints made, micrometastasis (mM) being detected using anti-PSA. The clinical parameters of total serum PSA, PSA velocity, PSA doubling time and time to biochemical failure, age, Gleason score and pathological stage were registered.  Results:   A total of 147 men, mean age 71.6 ± 8.2 years, with a median time to biochemical failure of 5.5 years (IQR 1.0-6.3 years) participated in the study. Bone marrow samples were positive for micrometastasis in 98/147 (67%) of patients at the time of biochemical failure. The results of bone marrow micrometastasis detected by immunocytochemistry were not concordant with local relapse as defined by PSA velocity, time to biochemical failure or Gleason score. In men with a PSA doubling time of < six months or a total serum PSA of >2,5ng/ml at the time of biochemical failure the detection of bone marrow micrometastasis was significantly higher.

The SHBG immunoreactivity in both the tumor cells and normal cells, together with the type, diffuseness and intensity of the staining were then evaluated. In the differential diagnosis of the adenocarcinomas of the organs, including the glandular structures, impressively valuable results are encountered in the tumor cells, whether the SHBG immunopositivity is evaluated alone or together with other IHC markers.

In the United States, it is more prevalent in African-American men than in Caucasian men. Prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to the bone, with most of the reported lesions appearing to be osteoblastic on radiographs. Here, we describe an unusual presentation of metastatic prostate cancer with diffuse osteolytic bone lesions.  Case presentation:   An 80-year-old previously healthy Hispanic man presented with worsening back pain, difficulty with ambulation, and bladder outlet obstruction. Physical examination was significant for spinal tenderness in the thoracic and lumbar region. Digital rectal examination was remarkable for asymmetric enlargement of the prostate with nodularity and firmness. Imaging studies revealed diffuse osteolytic lesions.

Methods:   A total of 822 consecutive men underwent RC in 3 academic centers between 1996 and 2011. The clinical significance of incidental PC was determined according to the Epstein criteria. The Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank was used to investigate the impact of PC on OS and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for risk factors of OS.

Men with PC were at higher risk for lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of BC compared to men without PC (p < 0.001). The 5-year OS for men with clinically significant, insignificant and no PC was 33.3, 51.3 and 51.5%, respectively (p = 0.050).

However, isolation of RNA from microdissected tissue is challenging due to degradation and minimal yield of RNA during laser capture microdissection (LCM). Our aim was to optimize the isolation of high-quality RNA from laser capture microdissected fresh frozen prostate tissue on the level of staining and RNA extraction.  Results:   Cresyl violet and haematoxylin were compared as histological stains for LCM. While RNA quality was similar for cresyl violet (median RIN 7.4) and haematoxylin (median RIN 7.6), tissue morphology was more detailed with cresyl violet as compared to haematoxylin. RNA quality from the following kits was compared: RNeasy(®) Micro (median RIN 7.2), miRNeasy Mini (median RIN 6.6), Picopure(®) (median RIN 6.0), mirVana™ miRNA (median RIN 6.5) and RNAqueous(®)-Micro (median RIN 6.3). RNA quality from microdissected samples with either the RNeasy Micro or miRNeasy Mini kit, was comparable to RNA isolated directly from whole tissue slices (median RIN 7.5, p = 0.09). Isolated RNA from benign and prostate cancer microdissected tissue demonstrated that RNA quality can vary between regions from the same clinical sample. Additionally, RNA quality (r = 0.89), but not quantity (r = 0.69) could be precisely measured with the Agilent Bioanalyzer.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that staining with cresyl violet results in the isolation of high quality RNA from laser capture microdissected tissue with high discriminative morphology.

This prospective, longitudinal, phase II study assessed fatigue, sleep, and serum cytokine levels during radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer (PCa).  Material and methods:   Twenty-eight men undergoing radiotherapy for early-stage PCa wore an Actiwatch Score to record fatigue level, sleep time, onset latency, efficiency and wake after sleep onset. Serum levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and VEGF were measured weekly during radiotherapy. Patient reported quality of life (QOL) metrics were collected before and after treatment. Linear mixed effects models examined trajectories across treatment weeks.  Results:   Fatigue increased across treatment weeks (P<.01), and fatigue was associated with decreased patient-reported QOL. Sleep efficiency increased across treatment weeks (rate of change over time=.29, P=.03), and sleep onset latency decreased (rate of change over time=.86, P=.06). IL-6 tended to increase during treatment (P=0.09), but none of the cytokine levels or sleep variables were significantly related to fatigue trajectories.  Conclusions:   Despite increased sleep efficiency across treatment weeks, fatigue significantly increased. Although IL-6 increased during the course of radiotherapy, cytokines levels were not associated with fatigue scores or sleep disturbance.

Efficient drug delivery requires both high cellular uptake of the nanoparticles and release of the drug from the nanoparticles. Release of hydrophobic drugs from PACA nanoparticles is primarily governed by nanoparticle degradation, and this process has been poorly studied at the cellular level. Here we use the hydrophobic model drug Nile Red 668 (NR668) to investigate intracellular degradation of PACA nanoparticles by measuring changes in NR668 fluorescence emission and lifetime, as the spectral properties of NR668 depend on the hydrophobicity of the dye environment. We also assess the potential of poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) and poly(octyl cyanoacrylate) (POCA) nanoparticles for intracellular drug delivery in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and rat brain endothelial cell line RBE4 and the role of endocytosis pathways in PACA nanoparticle uptake in those cell lines.  Results:   Fluorescence lifetime imaging, emission spectra analysis and Förster resonance energy transfer indicated that the intracellular degradation was in line with the degradation found by direct methods such as gas chromatography and scanning electron microscopy, showing that PBCA has a faster degradation rate compared to POCA. The combined P(BCA/OCA) nanoparticles had an intermediate degradation rate. The uptake of POCA and PBCA nanoparticles was much higher in RBE4 than in PC3 cells. Endocytosis inhibition studies showed that both clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis were involved in PACA nanoparticle uptake, and that the former played a predominant role, particularly in PC3 cells.  Conclusions:   In the present study, we used three different optical techniques to show that within a 24-hour period PBCA nanoparticles degraded significantly inside cells, releasing their payload into the cytosol, while POCA nanoparticles remained intact. This indicates that it is possible to tune the intracellular drug release rate by choosing appropriate monomers from the PACA family or by using hybrid PACA nanoparticles containing different monomers. In addition, we showed that the uptake of PACA nanoparticles depends not only on the monomer material, but also on the cell type, and that different cell lines can use different internalization pathways.""","""['Einar Sulheim', 'Habib Baghirov', 'Eva von Haartman', 'Andreas Bøe', 'Andreas K O Åslund', 'Yrr Mørch', 'Catharina de Lange Davies']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Cabazitaxel-loaded poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles: toxicity and changes in the proteome of breast, colon and prostate cancer cells.', 'The effect of poly(ethylene glycol) coating and monomer type on poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticle interactions with lipid monolayers and cells.', 'Core-shell type of nanoparticles composed of poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate)-co-(2-octyl cyanoacrylate) copolymers for drug delivery application: synthesis, characterization and in vitro degradation.', 'From poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) to squalene as core material for the design of nanomedicines.', 'Poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles for enhanced delivery of therapeutics - is there real potential?', 'An Update on Graphene Oxide: Applications and Toxicity.', 'Evaluation of the Growth-Inhibitory Spectrum of Three Types of Cyanoacrylate Nanoparticles on Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.', 'Identification of novel cyanoacrylate monomers for use in nanoparticle drug delivery systems prepared by miniemulsion polymerisation - A multistep screening approach.', 'Polymeric Nanoparticles in Brain Cancer Therapy: A Review of Current Approaches.', 'Standardization of an in vitro assay matrix to assess cytotoxicity of organic nanocarriers: a pilot interlaboratory comparison.']"""

MicroRNAs (miRs) have also been recognized as novel regulatory molecules of gene expression. The present study aimed to discover potential miRs that target NOB1 and regulate NOB1 expression in prostate cancer. miR-192, which is an important regulator of numerous cancers, was found to be significantly downregulated in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we noted that miR-192 overexpression markedly inhibited the proliferation, colony‑forming ability, and migratory capacity of the prostate cancer cells. miR-192 overexpression also induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, as shown by flow cytometry. Bioinformatics analysis results revealed that NOB1 was a possible candidate target gene of miR-192. This discovery was further verified through dual‑luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, and western blot analysis. We suggest that miR-192 directly regulates the mRNA and protein expression of NOB1. Furthermore, miR-192 inhibited the expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The results of our study indicated that miR-192 negatively regulated NOB1 expression and impaired the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells.

Cancer involvement can be measured by including intervening benign tissue or only including the actual cancer involved area. Importantly, this parameter is a common enrollment criterion for active surveillance protocols. We hypothesized that spatially distinct prostate cancer foci in biopsies may arise from separate clones, impacting cancer involvement assessment. Hence, we used dual ERG/SPINK1 immunohistochemistry to determine the frequency of separate clones-when separate tumor foci showed discordant ERG and/or SPINK1 status-in discontinuously involved prostate biopsy cores from two academic institutions. In our cohort of 97 prostate biopsy cores with spatially discrete tumor foci (from 80 patients), discontinuous cancer involvement including intervening tissue ranged from 20 to 100% and Gleason scores ranged from 6 to 9. Twenty-four (25%) of 97 discontinuously involved cores harbored clonally distinct cancer foci by discordant ERG and/or SPINK1 expression status: 58% (14/24) had one ERG(+) focus, and one ERG(-)/SPINK1(-) focus; 29% (7/24) had one SPINK1(+) focus and one ERG(-)/SPINK1(-) focus; and 13% (3/24) had one ERG(+) focus and one SPINK1(+) focus. ERG and SPINK1 overexpression were mutually exclusive in all tumor foci. In summary, our results show that ~25% of discontinuously involved prostate biopsy cores showed tumor foci with discordant ERG/SPINK1 status, consistent with multiclonal disease.

Materials and methods:   Tissue prints were done from freshly sectioned excised tissue fragments in patients operated between March 2010 and February 2012 in the Department of Surgery for cancer or benign lesions. Tissue prints were examined by a cytologist and considered as malignant or benign. Same fragments were then processed in the pathology laboratory using the typical paraffin-embedding method. All slides were examined by the same pathologist and considered the golden standard for malignancy and histological type.  Results:   Three hundred and eleven fragments were examined, obtained from lung masses, lymph nodes, pleura and mediastinal masses, pathology showed 208 malignant and 103 benign. Tissue prints identified 227 malignant and 84 benign. For identifying malignancy, tissue prints had a sensibility of 0.91, specificity 0.64. Positive predictive value was 0.86 and negative predictive value 0.78. For lymph nodes, the specificity was better. In lymphomas and adenocarcinomas, tissue prints identified also the histology type in most cases.

Single-institution studies have reported conflicting data on the relationship between PDE5i use and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (BCR) after radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between PDE5i use and BCR after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy in a nationwide population-based cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a nested case-control study using the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden linked to the Prescribed Drug Register. Among men with localized prostate cancer who underwent primary radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy during 2006-2007 with 5 yr of follow-up, 293 had BCR after treatment (cases). For each case we identified 20 BCR-free controls (n=5767) using incidence density sampling.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between PDE5i use and BCR risk. Separate multivariable models including clinical variables for men undergoing prostatectomy or radiotherapy and including surgical pathology after prostatectomy were also analyzed.  Results and limitations:   PDE5i use was not associated with BCR after radical prostatectomy (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-1.03) or radiation therapy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.49-1.97) after adjusting for marital status, education, income, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, Gleason score, and proportion of positive biopsies. Results were similar after additional adjustment for surgical pathology (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64-1.16). Men whose cumulative number of PDE5i pills was above the median had a slightly lower BCR risk after prostatectomy in the clinical model, and no difference in BCR risk after adjustment for pathologic tumor features.  Conclusions:   Our results from a population-based cohort suggest that BCR risk is not higher among men using PDE5i after prostate cancer treatment.

The cancer death rate has dropped by 23% since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease. Among children and adolescents (aged birth-19 years), brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia.

Our objective was to examine the biopsy results of men with symptomatic hypogonadism before or during therapy.  Materials and methods:   Data was extracted from our medical record on men with hypogonadism who had a prostate biopsy within the past 4 years done by 3 Urologists with guideline driven practice patterns.  Results:   96 men were identified. Mean age at biopsy was 63 (range 40-85) and median PSA was 3.78ng/dL (0.5-662). Of the 61 men not on TRT, median PSA was 4.34 (0.5 to 662) and mean total testosterone 254 (191-341). There were 29 (47.5%) prostate cancers found (6 Gleason score 6, 13 Gleason score 7, 10 Gleason score 8 or 9). Of the 35 men on TRT, median PSA was 3.27 (0.5 to 13.7).

Follow-up data showed reduced bladder toxicity in TomoTherapy patients compared to LINAC-IMRT. The purpose of this study was to quantify whether the treatment delivery technique and decreased margins affect reductions in bladder toxicity.  Patients and methods:   Setup corrections from 30 patients treated with helical TomoTherapy and 30 treated with a LINAC were analyzed. These data were used to simulate three IG protocols based on setup error correction and a limited number of imaging sessions. For all patients, gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was documented and correlated with the treatment delivery technique.  Results:   For fiducial marker (FM)-based RT, a margin reduction of up to 3.1, 3.0, and 4.8 mm in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively, could be achieved with calculation of a setup correction from the first three fractions and IG every second day. Although the bladder volume was treated with mean doses of 35 Gy in the TomoTherapy group vs. 22 Gy in the LINAC group, we observed less GU toxicity after TomoTherapy.  Conclusion:   Intraprostate FMs allow for small safety margins, help decrease imaging frequency after setup correction, and minimize the dose to bladder and rectum, resulting in lower GU toxicity. In addition, IMRT delivered with TomoTherapy helps to avoid hotspots in the bladder neck, a critical anatomic structure associated with post-RT urinary toxicity.""","""['Sonia Drozdz', 'Michael Schwedas', 'Henning Salz', 'Susan Foller', 'Thomas G Wendt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Acute toxicity after image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy compared to 3D conformal radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Acute toxicity in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with androgen suppression and hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Organ-confined prostate cancer: treatment with high doses of radioterapy (intensity modulated radiotherapy).', 'The role of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dosimetric implications of inter- and intrafractional prostate positioning errors during tomotherapy : Comparison of gold marker-based registrations with native MVCT.', 'Transperineal gold marker implantation for image-guided external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer : A single institution, prospective study.', 'Hydrogel injection reduces rectal toxicity after radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.']"""

In addition, we evaluated the relative contribution of these receptors to the activation of the ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases) signaling pathway. These four estrogen receptors were detected by Western blot assays and were shown by immunofluorescence assays to localize preferentially in extranuclear regions of PC-3 cells. In addition, treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) (1 μM) for 24 h led to down-regulation of the classic estrogen receptors, whereas E2 at physiological concentration (0.1 nM) for 24h tended to increase the levels of ERα and ERβ. Furthermore, the ERα-selective agonist PPT selectively increased the expression of ERβ and the ERβ-selective agonist DPN increased ERα levels. None of these treatments affected expression of the ER-α36 isoform. The unusual cytoplasmic localization of the classic estrogen receptors in these cells differs from the nuclear localization in the majority of estrogen target cells and suggests that rapid signaling pathways may be preferentially activated. In fact, treatment with selective agonists of ERα, ERβ and GPER induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was blocked by the respective antagonists. On the other hand, activation of ERK1/2 induced by E2 may involve additional mechanisms because it was not blocked by the three antagonists. Taken together, the results indicate that there is a crosstalk between ERα and ERβ to regulate the expression of each other, and suggest the involvement of other receptors, such as ER-α36, in the rapid ERK1/2 activation by E2. The identification of new isoforms of ERs, regulation of the receptors and signaling pathways is important to develop new therapeutic strategies for the castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['R Pisolato', 'A P G Lombardi', 'C M Vicente', 'T F G Lucas', 'M F M Lazari', 'C S Porto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Estrogen receptors localization and signaling pathways in DU-145 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) regulates the expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogen and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) protection against cell death in estrogen receptor alpha and beta expressing U2OS cells.', 'Estrogen receptor α and β in the normal immune system and in lymphoid malignancies.', 'Clinical significance of estrogen receptor β in breast and prostate cancer from biological aspects.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'Cell Uptake of Steroid-BODIPY Conjugates and Their Internalization Mechanisms: Cancer Theranostic Dyes.', 'Brazilian Berry Extract Differentially Induces Inflammatory and Immune Responses in Androgen Dependent and Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Overexpression of estrogen receptor GPER1 and G1 treatment reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in BEAS-2B bronchial cells.']"""

Nude mice were orally supplemented every day with a low or high dose [9 or 18 mg/kg body weight (BW)] of lycopene, torularhodin or torulene. Two weeks after the supplementation, mice were injected once with hormone-independent prostatic carcinoma PC-3 cells. When the tumor of the control group load exceeded 200 mm(3), mice were killed and the study was terminated. Compared with the controls, high-carotenoid supplementation lowered the mean number of tumors from 248.13 ± 28.74 to 50.83 ± 7.63, 70.34 ± 6.77, and 60.53 ± 6.78 mm(3) (P < 0.05, n = 8) by, respectively. Histological examination showed tumor degeneration, apoptosis and necrosis presented at the end of the experiment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry results showed Bcl-2 expression of the control group was higher than that of the carotenoid-treated group while the expression of Bax was lower than the carotenoid-treated group. High-carotenoid supplementation also increased the mRNA expressions of caspase-3, 8 and 9 in tumor tissues.

Materials and methods:   Forty-six patients without an obvious focal mass on baseline TRUS (grey-scale and colour Doppler), underwent additional CE-TRUS and TRUS-guided biopsy due to elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA ≥4 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). In all patients, CE-TRUS was performed with intravenous injection of a contrast agent (sulphur hexafluoride microbubble; SonoVue, 2.4 ml) before biopsy. TRUS-guided biopsy targeted suspicious areas detected on CE-TRUS imaging or sampled the outer gland of the normal prostate. The final diagnosis was based on results of the TRUS-guided biopsy. The diagnostic accuracy of baseline TRUS and CE-TRUS for diffuse prostatic lesions was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.  Results:   Diffuse prostate cancer was present in 32 (69.5%) patients and absent in 14 (30.5%) patients. Nineteen patients had diffuse prostate cancer that was not detected by baseline TRUS, whereas 15 cases were identified using CE-TRUS. Conversely, five patients had benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) that was diagnosed as cancer by CE-TRUS, and two of these patients were diagnosed with BPH by baseline TRUS. The combined sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 87.5%, 64.2%, and 80.4%, respectively, for CE-TRUS, and 40.6%, 78.5%, and 52.1%, respectively, for baseline TRUS. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for the diagnostic accuracy of baseline CE-TRUS versus TRUS for diffuse prostate cancer differed significantly at 0.904 and 0.667, respectively (Z=4.098, p<0.0001).  Conclusion:   CE-TRUS exhibited greater diagnostic accuracy for diffuse prostate cancer than baseline TRUS. CE-TRUS may improve cancer detection over baseline TRUS imaging for the diagnosis of diffuse prostate cancer in patients with an elevated PSA level. CE-TRUS detects diffuse prostate cancer without an obvious focal mass on routine TRUS or clinical examination, and therefore, may help identify patients who do not need a repeat biopsy or who do not need to undergo systematic 12-core invasive sampling biopsies.""","""['Y Gao', 'X H Liao', 'L Lu', 'L Wang', 'Y Ma', 'H Z Qin', 'X Yan', 'P Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Radiol""","""['The value and limitations of contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Colour Doppler and microbubble contrast agent ultrasonography do not improve cancer detection rate in transrectal systematic prostate biopsy sampling.', 'Can Power Doppler enhanced transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy improve prostate cancer detection on first and repeat prostate biopsy?', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional power Doppler angiography of the human prostate: correlation with biopsy outcome.', 'Association Between Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Indicators and Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Treatment.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound evaluation of the prostate before transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy can improve diagnostic sensitivity: A STARD-compliant article.']"""

Results:   Independent-samples t-test showed that, along with poorer tissue differentiation or higher clinical stage of PCa, the expression of TrkA was significantly up-regulated, that of p75NTR remarkably down-regulated, and the expression ratio of TrkA to p75NTR markedly increased.

Exercise is generally associated with a 50% reduction in adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD). The benefits of exercise extend well beyond the cardiovascular system. Recent evidence suggests that exercise prevents cell senescence, and active individuals are at lower risk of developing certain malignancies including cancer of the prostate and the colon, osteoporosis, depression and dementia. Individuals who exercise regularly extend their life expectancy by three to seven years. Healthy individuals should engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise per week. Recent studies have demonstrated that even lower volumes of exercise below these recommendations confer health benefits, which is highly relevant to individuals with established cardiac disease including heart failure. Sudden cardiac death in athletes under 35 is rare with.estimates ranging from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000. Hereditary and congenital abnormalities of the heart are the most common cause of nontraumatic death during sport in young athletes. In middle-aged recreational athletes more than 90% of sudden cardiac deaths occur in males and more than 90% are caused by atherosclerotic CAD. The AHA and the ESC advocate pre-participation screening of young athletes.

The development of novel therapeutic strategies that impair the metastatic process and associated skeletal adversities is therefore critical to improving prostate cancer patient survival. Recognition of the importance of Cathepsin L (CTSL) to metastatic dissemination of cancer cells has led to the development of several CTSL inhibition strategies. The present investigation employed intra-cardiac injection of human PC-3ML prostate cancer cells into nude mice to examine tumor cell dissemination in a preclinical bone metastasis model. CTSL knockdown confirmed the validity of targeting this protease and subsequent intervention studies with the small molecule CTSL inhibitor KGP94 resulted in a significant reduction in metastatic tumor burden in the bone and an improvement in overall survival. CTSL inhibition by KGP94 also led to a significant impairment of tumor initiated angiogenesis. Furthermore, KGP94 treatment decreased osteoclast formation and bone resorptive function, thus, perturbing the reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and osteoclasts within the bone microenvironment which typically result in bone loss and aggressive growth of metastases. These functional effects were accompanied by a significant downregulation of NFκB signaling activity and expression of osteoclastogenesis related NFκB target genes. Collectively, these data indicate that the CTSL inhibitor KGP94 has the potential to alleviate metastatic disease progression and associated skeletal morbidities and hence may have utility in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients.""","""['Dhivya R Sudhan', 'Christine Pampo', 'Lori Rice', 'Dietmar W Siemann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Cathepsin L in tumor angiogenesis and its therapeutic intervention by the small molecule inhibitor KGP94.', 'Cathepsin L inhibition by the small molecule KGP94 suppresses tumor microenvironment enhanced metastasis associated cell functions of prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'The MET/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)-targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Also Attenuates FMS-dependent Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Destruction Induced by Prostate Cancer.', 'Cathepsin L targeting in cancer treatment.', 'Cathepsin K inhibitors as treatment of bone metastasis.', 'Methyltransferase-like 3 promotes cervical cancer metastasis by enhancing cathepsin L mRNA stability in an N6-methyladenosine-dependent manner.', 'The Spatial Landscape of Progression and Immunoediting in Primary Melanoma at Single-Cell Resolution.', 'Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer: a lysosomal protease perspective.', 'Identification and Validation of a Tumor Microenvironment-Related Gene Signature for Prognostic Prediction in Advanced-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Effects of high-intensity training on prostate cancer-induced cardiac atrophy.']"""

Methods:   Clinico-pathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of all patients treated consecutively from 2005 to 2009 in phase I trials at the RMH were recorded.

MCAEF increased the signal-to-noise ratios of the detected proteins by a factor of 2 to 5, and 232 signals were detected within the m/z 3500-37500 mass range on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and with the sinapinic acid MALDI matrix. Among these species, three proteins (S100-A9, S100-A10, and S100-A12) were only observed in the cancerous cell region and 14 proteins, including a fragment of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 2, a fragment of cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19, 3 apolipoproteins (C-I, A-I, and A-II), 2 S100 proteins (A6 and A8), β-microseminoprotein, tumor protein D52, α-1-acid glycoprotein 1, heat shock protein β-1, prostate-specific antigen, and 2 unidentified large peptides at m/z 5002.2 and 6704.2, showed significantly differential distributions at the p < 0.05 (t-test) level between the cancerous and the noncancerous regions of the tissue. Among these 17 species, the distributions of apolipoprotein C-I, S100-A6, and S100-A8 were verified by immunohistological staining. In summary, this study resulted in the imaging of the largest group of proteins in prostate cancer tissues by MALDI-MS reported thus far, and is the first to show a correlation between S100 proteins and prostate cancer in a MS imaging study. The successful imaging of the three proteins only found in the cancerous tissues, as well as those showing differential expressions demonstrated the potential of MCAEF-MALDI/MS for the in situ detection of potential cancer biomarkers.

Patterns 1 and 2, comprising more than 30% of cases in the original publications by Gleason, are no longer reported on biopsy and are rarely diagnosed on radical prostatectomy. Many of these cases may even have been mimickers of prostate cancer that were described later with the use of contemporary immunohistochemistry. The original Gleason system predated many newly described variants of prostate cancer and our current concept of intraductal carcinoma. Gleason also did not describe how to report prostate cancer on biopsy with multiple cores of cancer or on radical prostatectomy with separate tumor nodules. To address these issues, the International Society of Urological Pathology first made revisions to the grading system in 2005, and subsequently in 2014. Additionally, a new grading system composed of Grade Groups 1 to 5 that was first developed in 2013 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and subsequently validated in a large multi-institutional and multimodal study was presented at the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology meeting and accepted both by participating pathologists as well as urologists, oncologists, and radiation therapists.

In obesity, higher secretion of CCL7 by adipocytes facilitates extraprostatic extension. The observed increase in migration associated with obesity is totally abrogated when the CCR3/CCL7 axis is inhibited.

Androgen receptor signaling-directed strategies are not curative in CRPC therapy, and new strategies targeting alternative, key cancer properties are needed. Using reprogrammed glucose metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), cancer cells typically secrete excessive amounts of lactic acid into their microenvironment, promoting cancer development, survival, and progression. Cellular lactic acid secretion is thought to be predominantly mediated by MCT4, a plasma membrane transporter protein. As such, the MCT4 gene provides a unique, potential therapeutic target for cancer.  Experimental design:   A tissue microarray of various Gleason grade human prostate cancers was stained for MCT4 protein. Specific, MCT4-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (MCT4 ASO) were designed and candidate MCT4 ASOs checked for effects on (i) MCT4 expression, lactic acid secretion/content, glucose consumption, glycolytic gene expression, and proliferation of human CRPC cells and (ii) growth of PC-3 tumors in nude mice.  Results:   Elevated MCT4 expression was associated with human CRPC and an earlier time to relapse. The treatment of PC-3, DU145, and C4-2 CRPC cultures with candidate MCT4 ASOs led to marked inhibition of MCT4 expression, lactic acid secretion, to increased intracellular lactic acid levels, and markedly reduced aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation. Treatment of PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice with the MCT4 ASOs markedly inhibited tumor growth without inducing major host toxicity.  Conclusions:   MCT4-targeting ASOs that inhibit lactic acid secretion may be useful for therapy of CRPC and other cancers, as they can interfere with reprogrammed energy metabolism of cancers, an emerging hallmark of cancer.

Methods:   347 patients enrolled from 2002 to 2010. Three increasing dose-per-fraction schedules of 64.7 Gy/22 fx, 58.08 Gy/16 fx and 51.6 Gy/12 fx were each designed to yield equivalent predicted late toxicity. Three quality of life (QoL) surveys were administered prior to treatment and annually upto 3 years.  Results:   Bowel QoL data at 3years revealed no significant difference among regimens (p=0.469). Bowel QoL for all regimens declined transiently, largely recovering by three years, with only the 22 fraction decrement reaching significance. Bladder outcomes at 3 years were comparable (p=0.343) although, for all patients combined, a significant decline was observed from the baseline (p=0.008). Spitzer quality of life data revealed similarly excellent, 3-year means (p=0.188). International erectile function data also revealed no significant differences at 3 years although all measures except intercourse satisfaction worsened post-treatment.  Conclusions:   Three-year QoL changes for bowel, bladder and SQLI were modest and similar for 3 HPFX regimens spanning 2.94-4.3 Gy per fraction.

Methods:   The collimator scatter factors were measured for 13 field shapes defined by an Elekta Agility MLC on a Synergy linac with 6MV photons. The value of the collimator scatter associated with each field was also calculated according to the equation Sc=Sc(mlc)+Sc(corr)(Sc(open)-Sc(mlc)) with Sc(corr) varied between 0 and 1, where Sc(open) is the value of collimator scatter calculated from the rectangular collimator-defined field and Sc(mlc) the value using only the MLC-defined field shape by applying sector integration. From this the optimum value of the correction was determined as that which gives the minimum difference between measured and calculated Sc. Single (simple fluence modulation) and dual-arc (complex fluence modulation) treatment plans were generated on the Monaco system for prostate volumetric modulated-arc therapy (VMAT) delivery. The planned MUs were verified by absolute dose measurement in phantom and by an independent MU calculation. The MU calculations were repeated with values of Sc(corr) between 0 and 1. The values of the correction yielding the minimum MU difference between treatment planning system (TPS) and check MU were established.  Results:   The empirically derived value of Sc(corr) giving the best fit to the measured collimator scatter factors was 0.49. This figure however was not found to be optimal for either the single- or dual-arc prostate VMAT plans, which required 0.80 and 0.34, respectively, to minimize the differences between the TPS and independent-check MU. Point dose measurement of the VMAT plans demonstrated that the TPS MUs were appropriate for the delivered dose.  Conclusions:   Although the value of Sc(corr) may be obtained by direct comparison of calculation with measurement, the efficacy of the value determined for VMAT-MU calculations are very much dependent on the complexity of the MLC delivery.""","""['Neil Richmond', 'Rachael Tulip', 'Chris Walker']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Variations in dosimetric distribution and plan complexity with collimator angles in hypofractionated volumetric arc radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Do technological advances in linear accelerators improve dosimetric outcomes in stereotaxy?

This study aimed to create a model to predict protocol violations based on patient anatomical variables and their potential relationship to target and organ at risk (OAR) end points in the setting of definitive, dose-escalated IMRT/VMAT prostate planning. Radiotherapy plans from 200 consecutive patients treated with definitive radiation for prostate cancer using IMRT or VMAT were analyzed. The first 100 patient plans (hypothesis-generating cohort) were examined to identify anatomical variables that predict for dosimetric outcome, in particular OAR end points. Variables that scored significance were further assessed for their ability to predict protocol violations using a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. These results were then validated in a second group of 100 patients (validation cohort). In the initial analysis of the hypothesis-generating cohort, percentage of rectum overlap in the planning target volume (PTV) (%OR) and percentage of bladder overlap in the PTV (%OB) were highlighted as significant predictors of rectal and bladder dosimetry. Lymph node treatment was also significant for bladder outcomes. For the validation cohort, CART analysis showed that %OR of < 6%, 6% to 9% and > 9% predicted a 13%, 63%, and 100% rate of rectal protocol violations respectively. For the bladder, %OB of < 9% vs > 9% is associated with 13% vs 88% rate of bladder constraint violations when lymph nodes were not treated. If nodal irradiation was delivered, plans with a %OB of < 9% had a 59% risk of violations. Percentage of rectum and bladder within the PTV can be used to identify individual plan potential to achieve dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints. A model based on these factors could be used to reduce planning time, improve work flow, and strengthen plan quality and consistency.""","""['Hannah Caine', 'Deborah Whalley', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Philip McCloud', 'Thomas Eade']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""[""A simple algorithm to predict non-compliance with organ at risk dose-volume constraints when planning intensity modulated post-prostatectomy radiation treatment: 'Why we should put the CART before the horse'."", 'A treatment planning and acute toxicity comparison of two pelvic nodal volume delineation techniques and delivery comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus volumetric modulated arc therapy for hypofractionated high-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Urethra-Sparing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Quality Assurance of a Randomized Phase 2 Trial.', 'Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Assessing the role of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) relative to IMRT and helical tomotherapy in the management of localized, locally advanced, and post-operative prostate cancer.', 'Dose Prediction Models Based on Geometric and Plan Optimization Parameter for Adjuvant Radiotherapy Planning Design in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Can automated treatment plans gain traction in the clinic?', 'Big Data Readiness in Radiation Oncology: An Efficient Approach for Relabeling Radiation Therapy Structures With Their TG-263 Standard Name in Real-World Data Sets.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Improving Quality and Consistency in NRG\xa0Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group\xa00631 for Spine Radiosurgery via Knowledge-Based Planning.']"""

Salvage prostate bed RT (66 Gy) started at day 100. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 months. Safety data, quality of life (QOL) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were measured over time.  Results:   Thirty-four men accrued in this multi-institutional clinical trial: 24% of men were node positive, 47% were Gleason 8-10, median PSA at entry was 0.54. The trial was terminated prematurely owing to excess DLTs (nine) including grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (n=4), neutropenic fever (n=2), AST increase (n=1), fatigue (n=1) and vomiting with diarrhea (n=1). PFS rate at 24 months was 51% (95% CI: 33, 67%) with a median PFS of 26.2 months (95% CI: 12.5, -). Six men (17.6%) had an undetectable PSA at 2 years.  Conclusions:   Sunitinib and docetaxel/prednisone followed by salvage RT resulted in excess pre-specified DLTs. Although nearly half of the men experienced durable disease control, efficacy was not greater than expected with radiation alone. The use of the intermediate end point of PFS in this salvage setting permitted an early decision on further development of this combination.""","""['A J Armstrong', 'S Halabi', 'P Healy', 'W R Lee', 'B F Koontz', 'J W Moul', 'K Mundy', 'P Creel', 'S Wood', 'K Davis', 'M A Carducci', 'M Stein', 'C Hobbs', 'B Reimer', 'M Nguyen', 'M Anand', 'L Bratt', 'S Kim', 'P T Tran', 'D J George;Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Sunitinib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer: a phase 1/2 clinical trial.', 'Upfront androgen deprivation therapy with salvage radiation may improve biochemical outcomes in prostate cancer patients with post-prostatectomy rising PSA.', 'Salvage radiotherapy with or without short-term hormone therapy for rising prostate-specific antigen concentration after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 16): a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 3 trial.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for PSA failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Precision Targets for Intercepting the Lethal Progression of Prostate Cancer: Potential Avenues for Personalized Therapy.', 'Drug Intensification in Future Postoperative Radiotherapy Practice in Biochemically-Relapsing Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Should androgen deprivation therapy and other systemic treatments be used in men with prostate cancer and a rising PSA post-local treatments?', 'Association of long-chain non-coding RNA GAS5 gene polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk and prognosis in Chinese Han population.', 'Tumor Immune Microenvironment Clusters in Localized Prostate Adenocarcinoma: Prognostic Impact of Macrophage Enriched/Plasma Cell Non-Enriched Subtypes.']"""

Also, to inquire the relationship between 2D:4D and severity of prostate cancer through Gleason scores.  Methods:   Digital measurements of the lengths of the index and ring fingers of both hands of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCA group, n=100) and healthy control individuals (n=100) were obtained using a digital vernier caliper.

Materials and methods:   From Feb 2011 to Jan 2012, 83 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients with prostate volume (PV) >30 mL were enrolled in our study. All the patients were older than 50 years and all of them received combined therapy (finasteride + doxazosin). All the patients were required for 1-year follow-up. PSA level and PV was measured at the start, 6 and 12 months, respectively.  Results:   79 patients completed the follow up. PSA level reduced by approximately 40 % during finasteride therapy. We defined baseline PSA as PSA1, PSA at 6 months as PSA2, PSA at 12 months as PSA3. PSA1 was significantly correlated with PSA2/PSA1 and PSA3/PSA1. However, prostate volume was not correlated with PSA1. We divided the patients into three groups according to PSA level. Groups 1, 2, 3 represented the patients with PSA less than 2 ng/mL, between 2 and 4 ng/mL and greater than 4 ng/mL, respectively. Both the PSA2/PSA1 and the PSA3/PSA1 had significant difference among three groups. Furthermore, group 1 and group 2 both showed the fairly large data variance.  Conclusions:   When baseline PSA level was greater than 4 ng/mL, the doubling rule could be used for screening. When baseline PSA level was less than 4 ng/Ml, the doubling rule might not be an accurate predictor.

It is a sensitive method with modest specificity. (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography has shown improved sensitivity and specificity over bone scintigraphy, but because of methodological issues such as retrospective design and verification bias, the existing level of evidence with (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography is limited. The primary objective is to compare the diagnostic properties of (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography versus bone scintigraphy on an individual patient basis.  Methods/design:   One hundred forty consecutive, high-risk prostate cancer patients will be recruited from several hospitals in Denmark. Sample size was calculated using Hayen's method for diagnostic comparative studies. This study will be conducted in accordance with recommendations of standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies. Eligibility criteria comprise the following: 1) biopsy-proven prostate cancer, 2) PSA ≥ 50 ng/ml (equals a prevalence of bone metastasis of ≈ 50% in the study population on bone scintigraphy), 3) patients must be eligible for androgen deprivation therapy, 4) no current or prior cancer (within the past 5 years), 5) ability to comply with imaging procedures, and 6) patients must not receive any investigational drugs. Planar bone scintigraphy and (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography will be performed within a window of 14 days at baseline. All scans will be repeated after 26 weeks of androgen deprivation therapy, and response of individual lesions will be used for diagnostic classification of the lesions on baseline imaging among responding patients. A response is defined as PSA normalisation or ≥ 80% reduction compared with baseline levels, testosterone below castration levels, no skeletal related events, and no clinical signs of progression. Images are read by blinded nuclear medicine physicians. The protocol is currently recruiting.  Discussion:   To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest prospective studies comparing (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography and bone scintigraphy.

The correlation between PSA levels and (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET parameters is also investigated.  Methods:   31 patients with biochemical failure after primary PC treatment with curative intent (median age 71.0 years) were enrolled in the analysis. The median PSA value was 2.0 ng/mL (range = 0.1 - 130.0 ng/mL) and the median Gleason score was 7 (range = 5 - 9). 8/31 (25.8 %) of the included patients had a PSA value < 0.5 ng/ml. All patients underwent dynamic PET/CT (dPET/CT) scanning (60 min) of the pelvis and lower abdomen as well as whole-body PET/CT with (68)Ga-PSMA-11. dPET/CT assessment was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a two-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach leading to the extraction of fractal dimension (FD).  Results:   22/31 patients (71.0 %) were (68)Ga-PSMA-11-positive, while 9/31 (29.0 %) patients were (68)Ga-PSMA-11-negative. The median PSA value in the (68)Ga-PSMA-11-positive group was significantly higher (median = 2.35 ng/mL; range = 0.19 - 130.0 ng/mL) than in the (68)Ga-PSMA-11-negative group (median value: 0.34 ng/mL; range = 0.10 - 4.20 ng/mL). A total of 76 lesions were semi-quantitatively evaluated. PC recurrence-associated lesions demonstrated a mean SUVaverage = 12.4 (median = 9.0; range = 2.2 - 84.5) and mean SUVmax = 18.8 (median = 14.1; range = 3.1 - 120.3). Dynamic PET/CT studies of the pelvis revealed the following mean values for the PC recurrence-suspicious lesions: K1 = 0.26, k3 = 0.30, influx = 0.14 and FD = 1.24. Time-activity curves derived from PC-recurrence indicative lesions revealed an increasing (68)Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation during dynamic PET acquisition. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate, but significant, correlation between PSA levels and the number of lesions detected on (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (r = 0.54) and between PSA levels and SUVaverage (r = 0.48) or SUVmax (r = 0.44).  Conclusions:   Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT demonstrated an overall detection rate of 71.0 % 60 min p.i. of the radiotracer in a mixed patient population with respect to PSA levels and including patients with very low PSA values. Higher PSA values were associated with a higher detection rate.

Methods:   This was a retrospective analysis of men in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System database. Men ≥ 40 years with a baseline PSA ≤ 4.0 ng/mL, not receiving 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and without a prostate cancer diagnosis prior to baseline PSA date were included and followed for 4 years. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer within 6 months of baseline were excluded. The optimal PSA threshold value for future 4-year prostate cancer risk was determined by maximizing Youden's index.

One hundred twenty PCa patients and 120 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) controls were genotyped using real-time PCR (LightCycler Instrument, Roche Diagnostics) and the melting curve analysis method. There was no significant difference in the frequency of genotypes for the two polymorphisms between PCa patients and controls (Χ2 = 0.857, p = 0.355 for IL-female 1; Χ2 = 0.026, p = 0.872 for IL-10).

In the adult human prostate, CD133 (PROM1) expression identifies infrequent prostate epithelial progenitor cells and putative cancer stem cells. Previous work demonstrated an association with CD133 and cancer cell proliferation using in vitro model systems. The primary objective here was to investigate the expression of CD133 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with mCRPC and to test the hypothesis that patients with mCRPC had CD133-positive CTCs associated with increased cell proliferation, changes in the androgen receptor (AR) protein expression, or AR nuclear co-localization. We utilized ImageStreamX technology, which combines flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, to capture and analyze CD45-negative/EpCAM-positive CTCs for CD133, Ki-67, and AR. All patient samples (20/20) contained CD133-positive populations of CTCs, and on average 50.9 ± 28.2% (range of 18.2% to 100%) of CTCs were CD133-positive. CD133-positive CTCs have increased Ki-67 protein expression compared to CD133-negative CTCs, implying that CD133-positive CTCs may have greater proliferative potential when compared to their CD133-negative counterparts.

Instead, the kinetics of the assembly of a peptide-based catalytic network serves to convert the quantity of analyte into amplified signal readout. The designed dynamic assembling and biosensing system has also been successfully applied in detecting the activity of polyglutamylation, an essential post translation modification controlling cell skeleton and cell cycle, in biological complex samples. Further studies reveal that the serum abundance of a polyglutamylase, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like protein 12, may show parallel with the degree of development of prostate cancer and the discrimination between early cancerous development and benign conditions.

PTEN deletion was associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BcR; hazard ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.39-9.22; P < 0.01) by multivariable Cox regression analyses and earlier BcR (P < 0.02) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. AR gain coexisted with X-chromosome gain and was associated with advanced tumor stage. When this panel was applied, two categories of combinatorial abnormalities proved clinically important. First, PTEN deletion without TMPRSS2/ERG rearrangement was enriched in pT3/4 tumors (70% versus 48%) and tumors with Gleason grades of 8 to 9 (60% versus 17%) compared with the entire cohort. These patients had earlier BcR than patients with normal FISH panel results (P < 0.01).

Patients and methods:   Three hundred and two patients treated with RARP or ORP were prospectively enrolled. One year after surgery, patients received a questionnaire to evaluate social life, duration of being limited in daily and sexual life as well as satisfaction with the treatment.  Results:   Both cohorts showed no differences in age, prostate specific-antigen-levels, Gleason score, prostate volume or T-stage (p > 0.05). Median blood loss was significant lower and the surgical time was significant higher in the RARP group. There were no significant differences regarding the duration of being limited in social or daily life or regarding the satisfaction with the treatment.

The inhibition of this enzyme has been shown to slow prostate cancer progression and is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. In previous work, we developed a highly potent and selective PACE4 inhibitor, the multi-Leu (ML) peptide, an octapeptide with the sequence Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH2 . Here, with the objective of developing a useful compound for in vivo administration, we investigate the effect of N-terminal modifications. The inhibitory activity, toxicity, stability, and cell penetration properties of the resulting analogues were studied and compared to the unmodified inhibitor. Our results show that the incorporation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety leads to a loss of antiproliferative activity, whereas the attachment of a lipid chain preserves or improves it. However, the lipidated peptides are significantly more toxic when compared with their unmodified counterparts. Therefore, the best results were achieved not by the N-terminal extension but by the protection of both ends with the d-Leu residue and 4-amidinobenzylamide, which yielded the most stable inhibitor, with an excellent activity and toxicity profile.""","""['Anna Kwiatkowska', 'Frédéric Couture', 'Christine Levesque', 'Kévin Ly', 'Sophie Beauchemin', 'Roxane Desjardins', 'Witold Neugebauer', 'Yves L Dory', 'Robert Day']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""[""Proprotein convertase inhibition: Paralyzing the cell's master switches."", 'Macrocyclization of a potent PACE4 inhibitor: Benefits and limitations.', 'Improving the Selectivity of PACE4 Inhibitors through Modifications of the P1 Residue.', 'Positional Scanning Identifies the Molecular Determinants of a High Affinity Multi-Leucine Inhibitor for Furin and PACE4.', 'The proprotein convertases furin and PACE4 play a significant role in tumor progression.', 'The Basicity Makes the Difference: Improved Canavanine-Derived Inhibitors of the Proprotein Convertase Furin.', 'Enhanced anti-tumor activity of the Multi-Leu peptide PACE4 inhibitor transformed into an albumin-bound tumor-targeting prodrug.', ""Proprotein convertase inhibition: Paralyzing the cell's master switches."", 'Elongated and Shortened Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of the Proprotein Convertase Furin.']"""

Here, we examined how FOXA1, GATA2 and AR crosstalk and regulate hormone-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that FOXA1 reprograms both AR and GATA2 cistrome by preferably recruiting them to FKHD-containing genomic sites. By contrast, GATA2 is unable to shift AR or FOXA1 to GATA motifs. Rather, GATA2 co-occupancy enhances AR and FOXA1 binding to nearby ARE and FKHD sites, respectively. Similarly, AR increases, but not reprograms, GATA2 and FOXA1 cistromes. Concordantly, GATA2 and AR strongly enhance the transcriptional program of each other, whereas FOXA1 regulates GATA2- and AR-mediated gene expression in a context-dependent manner due to its reprogramming effects.

Methods and results:   A total of 9307 outpatients with verified HF without a prior diagnosis of cancer (27% female, mean age 68 years, 89% with LVEF <45%) were included in the study. A diagnosis of any cancer and all-cause mortality was obtained from Danish national registries. Outcome was compared with the general Danish population. Overall and type-specific risk of cancer was analysed in an adjusted Poisson and Cox regression analysis. The 975 diagnoses of cancer in the HF cohort and 330 843 in the background population corresponded to incidence rates per 10 000 patient-years of 188.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 177.2-200.6] and 63.0 (95% CI 63.0-63.4), respectively.

Risk of any type of cancer was increased, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.15-1.33, c < 0.0001). Type-specific analysis demonstrated an increased hazard ratio for all major types of cancer except for prostate cancer.

Yet PSA is still widely used as a screening test and is not being abandoned. This remains a significant public health issue, and citizens' engagement is needed. This study was designed to produce a deliberation on the PSA screening test by a citizens' jury.  Methods:   Fifteen citizens were selected and balanced for sex, age, and education. They received an information booklet and participated in a two-day meeting with experts to reach a deliberation on the question ""Should the National Health Service discourage or recommend PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in men 55-69 years old?"". A facilitator ran the jurors' discussion.  Results:   All except three of the jurors decided that the National Health Service should discourage the use of PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in 55-69 year-old men. The jury was particularly convinced by the uncertainty of the test outcomes, the utility of the test, and its cost/benefit ratio. Before the meeting 60% of jurors would have recommended the test to a relative, and all the male jurors would have done so. After the meeting these percentages fell to 15% and 12%.  Conclusions:   This experience confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of delegating to a group of citizens the responsibility to decide on public health issues on behalf of the community. Public health authorities should invest in information campaigns aimed at the public and in educational initiatives for physicians.

Since the modified system was introduced, many cancers that previously would have been categorized as Gleason score (GS) 6 are now categorized as GS 7 based on biopsy specimens that only contain minimal amounts (<6%) of Gleason pattern (GP) 4 tissue. However, the clinical significance of observing <6% of GP 4 tissue in biopsies of GS 7 prostate cancer has not been studied.  Material and methods:   This study was based on needle biopsy specimens that were categorized as GS 6 or GS 7 and were obtained from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with available follow-up data. We assessed the quantity of GP 4 tissue in biopsy specimens of GS 7 prostate cancer. Further, we evaluated the correlation between the quantity of GP 4 tissue and disease progression after RP.  Results:   GP 4 comprising 26-49% of the specimen, GS 4+3 and percentage of total core tissue scored as positive were significant and independent predictors of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after RP, as assessed using a multivariate Cox regression model that included the quantity of GP 4 in the prostate biopsy specimen, preoperative PSA, perineural invasion, clinical stage, number of positive cores, and percentage of core tissue scored as positive. Cases with GS 3+3 and cases in which the observed GP 4 area was <6% did not differ significantly in terms of biochemical PSA recurrence (BPR) status. In contrast, cases with 6-25% GP 4 tissue, 26-49% GP 4 tissue, and GS 4+3 showed more frequent BPR than cases with GS 3+3.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that the quantity of GP 4 tissue in GS 7 cancer has clinical significance.

Methods:   A total of 1042 men underwent multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) and fusion biopsy consecutively in a prospective trial (2009-2014). An expert reader graded mpMRI regions of interest (ROIs) as 1 to 5 using published protocols. The fusion biopsy device was used to obtain targeted cores from ROIs (when present) followed by a fusion image-guided, 12-core systematic biopsy in all men, even if no suspicious ROI was noted. The primary endpoint of the study was the detection of csCaP (ie, Gleason score ≥ 7).  Results:   Among 825 men with ≥ 1 suspicious ROI of ≥ grade 3, 289 (35%) were found to have csCaP. Powerful predictors of csCaP were ROI grade (grade 5 vs grade 3: odds ratio, 6.5 [P<.01]) and prostate-specific antigen density (each increase of 0.05 ng/mL/cc: odds ratio, 1.4 [P<.01]). Combining systematic and targeted biopsies resulted in the detection of more patients with csCaP (289 patients) than targeting (229 patients) or systematic (199 patients) biopsy alone. Among patients with no suspicious ROI, 35 (16%) were found to have csCaP on systematic biopsy.  Conclusions:   In this prospective trial, MR-ultrasound fusion biopsy allowed for the detection of csCaP, with a direct relationship noted with ROI grade and prostate-specific antigen density. The combination of targeted and systematic biopsy detected more csCaP than either modality alone; systematic biopsies revealed csCaP in 16% of men with no suspicious MRI target.

Objective:   To evaluate the prognostic value of early postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after RP in patients with lymph node invasion (LNI).  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 319 prostate cancer patients with LNI who were treated with RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) at a single institution between 1998 and 2013. All men had complete clinical, pathologic, and follow-up data, including PSA value at 6 wk after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups according to PSA value at 6 wk after surgery: complete BR (PSA <0.1 ng/ml) and PSA persistence (PSA ≥0.1 ng/ml).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess 8-yr clinical recurrence (CR) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates according to PSA persistence after RP. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the association between PSA persistence and CR. Covariates consisted of pathologic Gleason score (≤7 vs ≥8), number of positive nodes, surgical margins status (negative vs positive), and adjuvant therapies (none vs androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs adjuvant radiotherapy plus ADT). When we performed multivariable analyses assessing the association between PSA persistence and CSM pathologic Gleason score represented the only covariate due to the low number of events (n=13).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 83 patients (26%) had PSA persistence. Men with PSA persistence had higher 8-yr CR and CSM rates than those with complete BR (69% vs 12% and 16% vs 4.2%, respectively; all p≤0.002). This was confirmed in multivariable analyses, where PSA persistence at 6 wk after surgery was an independent predictor of both CR (hazard ratio [HR]: 8.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.73-14.7; p≤0.001) and CSM (HR: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.63-2.86; p≤0.001). Pathologic stage lower than pT3a, biopsy and pathologic Gleason score ≥8, positive surgical margins, and three or more positive lymph nodes were significantly associated with PSA persistence (all p≤0.04). Our study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Early BR can be achieved in approximately 75% of men with LNI submitted to RP and ePLND. PSA assessment early after surgery has an important prognostic role in the prediction of CR and CSM in node-positive patients. A risk stratification of these patients based on PSA persistence could guide physicians to properly select patients who may benefit the most from timely multimodal treatments.  Patient summary:   The risk of clinical recurrence and cancer-specific mortality is heterogeneous in patients with prostate cancer with lymph node invasion. Node-positive patients with complete biochemical response early after surgery share more favorable oncologic outcomes than those with PSA persistence. These results are important to plan the optimal postoperative patient management.""","""['Lorenzo Bianchi', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Marco Moschini', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Impact of Postoperative Radiotherapy in Men with Persistently Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Long-term Survival Analysis.', 'More extensive pelvic lymph node dissection improves survival in patients with node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Long-term outcomes of salvage lymph node dissection for clinically recurrent prostate cancer: results of a single-institution series with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Eight 7-O-alkylsilibinins, eight 7-O-alkyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinins, and eight 3,7-O-dialkyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinins have been synthesized from commercially available silibinin for the in vitro cell-based evaluation. The WST-1 cell proliferation assay indicates that nineteen out of twenty-four silibinin derivatives have significantly improved antiproliferative potency when compared with silibinin. 7-O-Methylsilibinin (2) and 7-O-ethylsilibinin (3) have been identified as the most potent compounds with 98- and 123-fold enhanced potency against LNCaP human androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line. Among 2,3-dehydrosilibinin derivatives, 7-O-methyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinin (10) and 7-O-ethyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinin (11) have been identified as the optimal compounds with the highest potency towards both androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. 7-O-Ethyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinin (11) was demonstrated to arrest PC-3 cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and to induce PC-3 cell apoptosis. The findings in this study suggest that antiproliferative potency of silibinin and 2,3-dehydrosilibinin can be appreciably enhanced through suitable chemical modifications on the phenolic hydroxyl group at C-7 and that introduction of a chemical moiety with the potential to improve bioavailability through a linker to 7-OH in silibinin and 2,3-dehydrosilibinin would be a feasible strategy for the development of silibinin derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents.""","""['Bao Vue', 'Sheng Zhang', 'Xiaojie Zhang', 'Konstantinos Parisis', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Shilong Zheng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['3-O-Alkyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinins: Two synthetic approaches and in vitro effects toward prostate cancer cells.', '5- or/and 20-O-alkyl-2,3-dehydrosilybins: Synthesis and biological profiles on prostate cancer cell models.', '7-O-aminoalkyl-2,3-dehydrosilibinins: Synthesis and in vitro Anti-cancer Efficacy.', 'Molecular mechanisms of silibinin-mediated cancer chemoprevention with major emphasis on prostate cancer.', 'A Trojan horse in drug development: targeting of thapsigargins towards prostate cancer cells.', 'Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Glycosylated Derivatives of Silibinin as Potential Anti-Tumor Agents.', 'Core Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of 5,7,20-O-Trimethylsilybins in Prostate Cancer Cell Models.', 'Silibinin Therapy Improves Cholangiocarcinoma Outcomes by Regulating ERK/Mitochondrial Pathway.', 'PEG-Modified tert-Octylcalix8arenes as Drug Delivery Nanocarriers of Silibinin.', '3-O-Carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins: Synthesis and Preliminary Antiproliferative Evaluation.']"""

We investigated whether genes associated with a highly tumorigenic, drug resistant, progenitor phenotype impact PCa biology and recurrence.  Methods:   Radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens (±disease recurrence, N = 276) were analyzed by qRT-PCR to quantify expression of genes associated with self-renewal, drug resistance, and tumorigenicity in prior studies. Associations between gene expression and PCa recurrence were confirmed by bootstrap internal validation and by external validation in independent cohorts (total N = 675) and in silico. siRNA knockdown and lentiviral overexpression were used to determine the effect of gene expression on PCa invasion, proliferation, and tumor growth.  Results:   Four candidate genes were differentially expressed in PCa recurrence. Of these, low AXIN2 expression was internally validated in the discovery cohort. Validation in external cohorts and in silico demonstrated that low AXIN2 was independently associated with more aggressive PCa, biochemical recurrence, and metastasis-free survival after RP. Functionally, siRNA-mediated depletion of AXIN2 significantly increased invasiveness, proliferation, and tumor growth. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of AXIN2 significantly reduced invasiveness, proliferation, and tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Low AXIN2 expression was associated with PCa recurrence after RP in our test population as well as in external validation cohorts, and its expression levels in PCa cells significantly impacted invasiveness, proliferation, and tumor growth.

However, the regulatory mechanisms involving miRNAs in prostate cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we found that miR-103 is down-regulated in prostate cancer and closely associated with tumor proliferation and migration. Our objective was to explore the role of the miR-103 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this study, we measured miR-103 level using real-time polymerase chain reaction in the human prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3, LNCap, 22Rv1, DU145, and the normal prostate epithelium cell line RWPE-1, a total of 25 pairs of primary prostate cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (NCTs) were measured also. In addition, over-expression of miR-103 in prostate cancer cell lines to determine the role of miR-103 in prostate cancer.  Results:   We found that miR-103 is down-regulated in prostate cancer and closely associated with tumor proliferation and migration. In addition, over-expression of miR-103 apparently inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Gain-of-function in vitro experiments further show that miR-103 mimics significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and increase the cell cycle in G1 phase, while promoted cell apoptosis. Subsequent dual-luciferase reporter assay identified one of the proto-oncogene PDCD10 as direct target of miR-103.  Conclusions:   Therefore, our data collectively demonstrate that miR-103 is a proto-oncogene miRNA that can suppress prostate cancer proliferation and migration by down-regulating the oncogene PDCD10, indicating that miR-103 may represent a new potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Xiaoliang Fu', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yansheng Su', 'Lu Lu', 'Dong Wang', 'He Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['CircSMARCA5 Facilitates the Progression of Prostate Cancer Through miR-432/PDCD10 Axis.', 'MicroRNA-125b promotes tumor growth and suppresses apoptosis by targeting DRAM2 in retinoblastoma.', 'MicroRNA-494-3p targets CXCR4 to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Roles of miR-25 and its Targeted Genes in Development of Human Cancer.', 'The Dual Role of PDCD10 in Cancers: A Promising Therapeutic Target.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis on the Oncogenic Role of Programmed Cell Death 10.', 'METTL1 promotes neuroblastoma development through m7G tRNA modification and selective oncogenic gene translation.', 'Changes in miroRNA-103 expression in wound margin tissue are related to wound healing of diabetes foot ulcers.', 'The Prognostic Signature and Therapeutic Value of Phagocytic Regulatory Factors in Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD).']"""

We provided incidence, mortality, and prevalence estimates at national and geographical area levels, together with time projections up to the year 2020. We applied the MIAMOD method, using as input national mortality data for the years 1970-2010 and population-based survival data for the period of diagnosis (1985-2002). We assumed relative survival of prostate cancer remained constant after the year of diagnosis (2005). The age-standardized incidence rates of PC were estimated to increase during the period 1984-2005, from 31 per 100,000 in 1984 to 93 per 100,000 in 2005. From 2005 onwards, the estimated rates declined to 71 in 2015 and to 62 in 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates slightly increased from 1970 up to about 19 per 100,000 in 1999 and then started to decrease with an estimated reduction of about 2.3% per year. Mortality projections indicated a continuing reduction, with a predicted age-standardized rate of about 12 per 100,000 in 2020. Prevalence was estimated to continuously increase up to a crude prevalence value of 1.2% in the year 2020.

LEDGF/p75, also known as the DFS70 autoantigen, is a stress transcription co-activator implicated in cancer, HIV-AIDS, and autoimmunity. This protein is targeted by autoantibodies in certain subsets of patients with PCa and inflammatory conditions, as well as in some apparently healthy individuals. LEDGF/p75 is overexpressed in PCa and other cancers, and promotes resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell death via the transactivation of survival proteins. We report in this study that overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells attenuates oxidative stress-induced necrosis but not staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This finding was consistent with the observation that while LEDGF/p75 was robustly cleaved in apoptotic cells into a p65 fragment that lacks stress survival activity, it remained relatively intact in necrotic cells. Overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells led to the upregulation of transcript and protein levels of the thiol-oxidoreductase ERp57 (also known as GRP58 and PDIA3), whereas its depletion led to ERp57 transcript downregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcription reporter assays showed LEDGF/p75 binding to and transactivating the ERp57 promoter, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly elevated co-expression of these two proteins in clinical prostate tumor tissues. Our results suggest that LEDGF/p75 is not an inhibitor of apoptosis but rather an antagonist of oxidative stress-induced necrosis, and that its overexpression in PCa leads to ERp57 upregulation. These findings are of significance in clarifying the role of the LEDGF/p75 stress survival pathway in PCa.""","""['Anamika Basu', 'Christina K Cajigas-Du Ross', 'Leslimar Rios-Colon', 'Melanie Mediavilla-Varela', 'Tracy R Daniels-Wells', 'Lai Sum Leoh', 'Heather Rojas', 'Hiya Banerjee', 'Shannalee R Martinez', 'Stephanny Acevedo-Martinez', 'Carlos A Casiano']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pathway specific gene expression profiling reveals oxidative stress genes potentially regulated by transcription co-activator LEDGF/p75 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Alternative splicing and caspase-mediated cleavage generate antagonistic variants of the stress oncoprotein LEDGF/p75.', 'The stress oncoprotein LEDGF/p75 interacts with the methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 and influences its transcriptional activity.', 'LEDGF/p75: a novel nuclear autoantigen at the crossroads of cell survival and apoptosis.', 'LEDGF/p75-mediated chemoresistance of mixed-lineage leukemia involves cell survival pathways and super enhancer activators.', 'Relationship Between Anti-DFS70 Autoantibodies and Oxidative Stress.', 'The LEDGF/p75 Integrase Binding Domain Interactome Contributes to the Survival, Clonogenicity, and Tumorsphere Formation of Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'LEDGINs, Inhibitors of the Interaction Between HIV-1 Integrase and LEDGF/p75, Are Potent Antivirals with a Potential to Cure HIV Infection.', 'Impairment of cell adhesion and migration by inhibition of protein disulphide isomerases in three breast cancer cell lines.', 'Impact of Androgen Deprivation on Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Status in Nigerian Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy.']"""

Fluorescently labeled bisphosphonate probes (Alendronate-fluorescein/Alendronate-Cy5) were developed for nanoscale flow cytometry to enumerate nanocrystals that bound the fluorescent probes. Petrographic sections of stones were also imaged by fluorescent and polarized light microscopy with composition analysis correlated to alendronate +ve nanocrystal counts in corresponding urine samples. Urine samples from patients with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) based calculi exhibited the highest alendronate +ve nanocrystal counts, ranging from 100-1000 nm in diameter. This novel urine based assay was in agreement with composition determined by petrographic thin sections with Alendronate probes. In some cases, high alendronate +ve nanocrystal counts indicated a Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) composition, as confirmed by petrographic analysis, overturning initial spectrophotometric diagnosis of stone composition.

The present study demonstrates the role of halichondrin B amide (HCBA), an analog of halichondrin Bas an antitumor agent, its mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics. The results revealed that HCBA effectively inhibitscell growth in a variety of tumor types in vitro. The HCT116 DPC4 (-/-) colon cancer cell line was the most sensitive with an IC50 of 2.02 μM, compared to 3.78 μM in the parental HCT116. It also effectively reduced tumor growth in SCID mice human tumor xenografts of MV-4-11 acute myeloid leukemia, MM.1S multiple myeloma and DU-145 prostate cancer. HCBA caused accumulation of H69S, MM.1S, U266 and 8226/S cells in G2/M-phase after 24 h. There was a significant increase in the positive histone H3 cells from a baseline value of 4.38 to 53.45% in 8226/S cells and from 4.32 to 43.83% in MM.1S cells on treatment with HCBA. The results from pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated relatively high oral bioavailability of 83% with distribution in both plasma and bone marrow. In non-tumor bearing SCID mice injected with a single acute lethal dose of HCBA no myelosuppression was observed. Flow cytometry analysis showed cell cycle arrest in metaphase. It also caused inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Thus, HCBA appears to be a potent agent to arrest cell cyclin the metaphase and inhibit tubulin polymerization.

Increasing evidence suggests that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in serum may be potential noninvasive biomarkers for certain diseases. The objective of the present study was to investigate and assess whether exosomal miR-141 is an effective biomarker for human PCa.  Methods:   In the present study, exosomes were isolated from the serum of patients with PCa, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and healthy volunteers. The total RNA was extracted from the exosomes and the level of miR-141 was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of miR-141 were compared between the whole serum and the serum exosomes of the three groups. Subsequently, the relevance of the exosomal expression of miR-141 to the clinicopathological factors in PCa was investigated.  Results:   The expression of miR-141 was higher in exosomes compared with whole serum (control group, P=0.0003; BPH group, P=0.0016; PCa group, P<0.0001). The level of serum exosomal miR-141 was significantly higher in the patients with PCa compared with the patients with BPH and the healthy controls (3.85-fold, P=0.0007 and 4.06-fold, P=0.0005, respectively). In addition, the expression levels were significantly higher in metastatic PCa compared with localized PCa (P<0.0001). Receiver-operating characteristic curve revealed that the serum exosomal miR-141 yielded an area under the curve of 0.8694, with 80% sensitivity and 87.1% specificity in discriminating patients with metastatic PCa from the patients with localized PCa.  Conclusion:   Serum exosomes may serve as a more suitable material compared with the whole serum for measuring circulating miR-141 levels in patients with PCa.

The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate a novel CXCR4-targeted PET probe in patients with solid cancers with reported in vitro evidence of CXCR4 overexpression and to estimate its potential diagnostic value.  Methods:   Twenty-one patients with histologically proven pancreatic cancer, laryngeal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, sarcoma, or cancer of unknown primary underwent PET imaging using the novel CXCR4 nuclear probe (68)Ga-pentixafor. The SUVmax of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow was measured to determine physiologic tracer distribution. For evaluation of tracer accumulation in solid cancers, SUVmax and tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios were determined in a total of 43 malignant lesions, including 8 primary tumors, 3 locally recurrent tumors, and 32 metastases. When available, the SUVmax of malignant lesions was compared with the corresponding SUVmax measured in routine (18)F-FDG PET.  Results:   Moderate tracer accumulation was detectable in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen, with a mean SUVmax of 3.1, 3.7, and 5.6, respectively. By visual interpretation criteria, 9 of 11 primary and locally recurrent tumors were detectable, exhibiting a mean SUVmax of 4.7 (range, 2.1-10.9) and a mean T/B ratio of 2.9. Twenty of 32 evaluated metastases were visually detectable (mean SUVmax, 4.5 [range, 3.2-13.8]; mean T/B ratio, 2.8). The highest signal was detected in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (SUVmax, 10.9; T/B ratio, 8.4) and a patient with cancer of unknown primary (SUVmax, 13.8; T/B ratio, 8.1). Compared with (18)F-FDG PET, which was additionally performed in 10 patients, (68)Ga-pentixafor PET had a lower SUVmax in all measured malignant lesions.  Conclusion:   On the basis of these first observations in a small and heterogeneous patient cohort, the in vitro CXCR4 expression profile of solid cancers and metastases described in the previous literature does not seem to sufficiently depict the in vivo distribution revealed by CXCR4-targeted PET.

NOTCH has been identified as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer, but prior reports have focused on NOTCH1 Here we hypothesized that NOTCH2 is an oncogene suitable for therapeutic targeting in bladder cancer.  Experimental design:   We studied genomic aberrations of NOTCH, compared survival and tumor progression according to NOTCH2 expression levels, and studied NOTCH2 function in vitro and vivo  Results:   We report a high rate of NOTCH2 copy number gain in bladder cancer. High NOTCH2 expression was identified especially in the basal subtype and in mesenchymal tumors. NOTCH2 activation correlated with adverse disease parameters and worse prognosis by immunohistochemistry. Forced overexpression of the intracellular domain of NOTCH2 (N2ICD) induced cell growth and invasion by cell-cycle progression, maintenance of stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These effects were abrogated by silencing of CSL, indicating that the effects were mediated through the canonical NOTCH signaling pathway. In an orthotopic xenograft model, forced overexpression of N2ICD increased growth, invasion, and metastasis. To explore the potential for therapeutic targeting of NOTCH2, we first silenced the receptor with shRNA and subsequently treated with a specific inhibitory antibody. Both interventions decreased cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in the orthotopic xenograft model.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated that NOTCH2 acts as an oncogene that promotes bladder cancer growth and metastasis through EMT, cell-cycle progression, and maintenance of stemness.

Radiopharmaceutical tracers applied were (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose, (18F)-fluoroethylcholine (FEC) and (68Ga)-DOTATATE. Histopathology and/or all conventional radiographic work-up and clinical course served as standard of reference. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used for analysis.  Results:   PET/CT detected all orbital masses. All 15 patients had malignant disease. Local osseous infiltration was correctly identified in 11 patients. Lymph node metastases were present in two of eight patients (25%) with haematogenous orbital metastases and in five of six patients (83%) with infiltrative carcinoma (p=0.05).

Materials and methods:   The eligible studies included randomized studies evaluating chemohormonal regimens in the setting of high-risk localized or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Results:   The search strategy yielded 900 potentially relevant citations from the searched databases. After exclusion of the ineligible studies, 10 studies were included in the qualitative analysis, among which 5 studies that had evaluated a docetaxel-hormonal therapy combination were included in the final quantitative analysis. For metastatic hormone-sensitive disease, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.70; P < .00001), and the pooled HR for overall survival (OS) was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65-0.86; P = .0001).

Although this technological evolution has clear advantages, the physical nature of robotic systems limits the integrated use of routine radioguided surgery technologies. Hence, engineering effort in robotics are focused on the integration of fluorescence guidance technologies. Using the hybrid SN tracer indocyanine green-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid (radioactive and fluorescent), for the first time in combination with a robot-integrated laparoscope, we investigated whether the robot-assisted approach affects the accuracy of fluorescence detection of SNs identified preoperatively using nuclear medicine.  Methods:   The study included 55 patients (Briganti nomogram-based risk >5 % on LN metastases) scheduled for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, SN biopsy and ePLND. Following indocyanine green-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid injection, preoperative nuclear imaging (lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT) was used to locate the SN(s). The fluorescence laparoscope was used intraoperatively to identify the SN(s) with standard fluorescence settings (in 50 patients) and with customized settings (in 5 patients). The number and location of the SNs, the radioactive, fluorescence (both in vivo and ex vivo) and tumour status of the resected SNs/LNs, and postoperative complications were recorded and analysed.  Results:   Combined, preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging identified 212 SNs (median 4 per patient). Intraoperative fluorescence imaging using standard fluorescence settings visualized 80.4 % (148/184 SNs; 50 patients; ex vivo 97.8 %). This increased to 85.7 % (12/14 SNs; 5 patients; ex vivo 100 %) with customized fluorescence settings. SPECT/CT images provided guidance towards the residual SNs. Ex vivo all removed SNs were radioactive. SNs were tumour-positive in 25.4 % of patients (14/55; false-negative rate 7 %, 1/14 patients). In ten patients, the SN was the only tumour-positive LN. Surgical complications were minimal.  Conclusion:   Directly linking 3D preoperative nuclear imaging information on SNs to a robot-integrated fluorescence laparoscope improved the surgeon's use of the technology and did not influence the sensitivity or morbidity of the procedure.

Core 2 β-1, 6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase-1 (GCNT1) is a key enzyme that forms core 2 branched O-glycans, the expression of which is associated with aggressive potential of prostate cancer. We examined whether GCNT1 expression in prostate biopsy specimen can predict cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy for the patients with with PCa. We then investigated molecular background for aggressive malignant potential mediated by GCNT1 expression.  Methods:   Paraffin-embedded PCa biopsy specimens were immunohisto-chemically tested for GCNT1 expression using an anti-GCNT1 monoclonal antibody. We also examined the role of GCNT1 in PCa progression using cell lines which express high or low levels of GCNT1.  Results:   GCNT1 expression correlated with D' Amico's recurrence risk classification. The GCNT1-positive rate in organ confined PCa was significantly lower than that in PCa with extra-prostatic extension. GCNT1-negative tumors were associated with significantly better prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-free survival compared with GCNT1-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that GCNT1 expression status was an independent risk factor for PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Subsequent basic study revealed that GCNT1-over-expressing cells produced a significantly larger amount of growth factors when co-cultured with prostate stromal cells compared with GCNT1-knocked down cells and formed larger tumors.  Conclusions:   GCNT1 expression in prostate biopsy specimen is a significant and independent predictor of recurrence after radical prostatectomy, which can be used in pre-treatment decision making for the patient. Further validation study is necessary to establish clinical implication of GCNT1 in management of PCa.""","""['Tendo Sato', 'Tohru Yoneyama', 'Yuki Tobisawa', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Hayato Yamamoto', 'Yuta Kojima', 'Jotaro Mikami', 'Kazuyuki Mori', 'Yasuhiro Hashimoto', 'Takuya Koie', 'Chikara Ohyama']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Detection of Core2 β-1,6-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase in Post-Digital Rectal Examination Urine Is a Reliable Indicator for Extracapsular Extension of Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and Clinical Application of Glycan-Targeted Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'PPM1D as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer.', 'Metabolomic profiling for the identification of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer: an update.', 'Exploring Prognosis-Associated Biomarkers of Estrogen-Independent Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma by Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Glycosylation: Rising Potential for Prostate Cancer Evaluation.', 'Narrative review of urinary glycan biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Predictive Role of Biopsy Based Biomarkers for Radiotherapy Treatment in Rectal Cancer.']"""

LHRH agonists are usually administered indefinitely at a fixed interval.  Methods:   We recruited men with advanced prostate cancer who had been on fixed-schedule injections of an LHRH agonist for ≥1 year and had castrate serum testosterone [<1.75 nmol/l (approx. 50 ng/ml)]. Testosterone levels were measured at 6-week intervals and ADT was withheld until testosterone levels were no longer in the castrate range and then reinstituted. Time to reinstitution of ADT was the primary outcome and was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method; Cox regression was used to identify factors predicting delay in reinstitution of treatment. Influence on quality-of-life (QoL) was evaluated by the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC).  Results:   Forty-six evaluable men who had received LHRH agonist injections every 12 weeks were recruited. Median time to testosterone recovery (defined as testosterone outside the defined castrate level) after previous injection was >1 year. In univariable analysis, lower baseline testosterone [≤1 vs. >1 nmol/l (approx. 30 ng/dl)] and longer time on ADT (>5 vs. ≤5 years) predicted for prolonged time to testosterone recovery, but only lower baseline testosterone remained significant in multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio = 5.2, P = 0.03). Overall EPIC scores remained stable but improvement from baseline was observed in the hormonal domain (P = 0.002). Median per-patient saving in cost was approximately USD 3,100 (1,050-6,200).  Conclusions:   Testosterone-guided ADT reduces exposure to LHRH agonists, with reduction in cost and improvement in some symptoms from ADT.

From a source population of 1313 US Veterans with prostate cancer, including 623 treated with curative intent, the study population included 242 men experiencing biochemical failure, 81 after surgery and 161 after radiation therapy. Clinically relevant calculations of PSA velocity (linear slope) and PSA doubling time (logarithmic slope) were assessed for their association with 11-16 years of mortality from prostate cancer. Death due to prostate cancer occurred in 52/242 (21.5%) men. Among men receiving surgery, PSA velocity ≥1.0 ng/mL/year was associated with increased prostate cancer mortality (HR=4.2, p value=0.037), whereas doubling time ≤12 months did not confer risk (HR=1.0, p value=0.95). Conversely, among patients receiving radiation therapy, doubling time ≤12 months was associated with increased prostate cancer mortality (HR=2.4, p value=0.049), but velocity did not confer a statistically significant risk (HR=3.8, p value=0.19).

The existing literature is sparse and controversial.  Materials and methods:   We studied patients who underwent elastography based and systematic biopsy between October 2009 and February 2015 at Braunschweig Prostate Cancer Center. Patients were separated according to first vs repeat biopsy setting. Each prostate sextant was considered an individual case. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of elastography to predict biopsy results were analyzed. The 95% CIs were determined by bootstrapping analysis of 2,000 samples.  Results:   Overall 679 men and a total of 4,074 sextants were identified. Of the 679 men 160 (23.6%) underwent first biopsy and 519 (76.4%) underwent repeat biopsy.

In this report, the American Cancer Society presents AANHPI cancer incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among AANHPIs in 2016, there will be an estimated 57,740 new cancer cases and 16,910 cancer deaths. While AANHPIs have 30% to 40% lower incidence and mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined, risk of stomach and liver cancers is double. The male-to-female incidence rate ratio among AANHPIs declined from 1.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.36-1.49) in 1992 to 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.07) in 2012 because of declining prostate and lung cancer rates in males and increasing breast cancer rates in females. The diversity within the AANHPI population is reflected in the disparate cancer risk by subgroup. For example, the overall incidence rate in Samoan men (526.5 per 100,000) is more than twice that in Asian Indian/Pakistani men (216.8). Variations in cancer rates in AANHPIs are related to differences in behavioral risk factors, use of screening and preventive services, and exposure to cancer-causing infections. Cancer-control strategies include improved use of vaccination and screening; interventions to increase physical activity and reduce excess body weight, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption; and subgroup-level research on burden and risk factors.

Methods:   This randomised controlled trial investigated the effects of a 12-week lifestyle intervention that included supervised exercise training and dietary advice on markers of cardiovascular risk in 50 men on long-term ADT recruited to an on-going study investigating the effects of such a lifestyle intervention on quality of life. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention or usual care. Cardiovascular outcomes included endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery), blood pressure, body composition and serum lipids. Additional outcomes included treadmill walk time and exercise and dietary behaviours. Outcomes were assessed before randomisation (baseline), and 6, 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation.  Results:   At 12 weeks, the difference in mean relative FMD was 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-4.3, P=0.04) with an effect size of 0.60 (95% CI <0.01-1.18) favouring the intervention group.

Patients and methods:   In the global Prostate cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study, men are prospectively followed on AS and repeat prostate biopsies are scheduled at 1, 4, and 7 years after the diagnostic biopsy, or once yearly if prostate-specific antigen-doubling time is <10 years. Data on complications after biopsy, including infection, haematuria, haematospermia, and pain, were retrospectively collected for all biopsies taken during follow-up in men from several large participating centres. Generalised estimating equations were used to test predictors of infection after biopsy. Competing risk analysis was used to compare the rates of men receiving further biopsies between men with and without previous complications.  Results:   In all, 2 184 biopsies were taken in 1 164 men. Infection was reported after 55 biopsies (2.5%), and one in five men reported any form of complication. At multivariable analysis, the number of previous biopsies was not a significant predictor of infection (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.43). The only significant predictor for infection was the type of prophylaxis used. Of all men with a complication at the diagnostic or first repeat biopsy, 21% did not have a repeat biopsy at the time a repeat biopsy was scheduled according to protocol, vs 12% for men without a previous biopsy complication.  Conclusion:   In our present cohort of men on AS, we found no evidence that repeat prostate biopsy in itself posed a risk of infection.

As proof of concept, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was selected as a model target. Using a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) as a carrier, we synthesized the primer-AuNP-aptamer bioconjugate for signal amplification by increasing the primer/aptamer ratio. The specific construction of primer-AuNP-aptamer/PSA/anti-PSA sandwich structure triggered the effective RCA reaction, in which thousands of tandem poly(thymine) repeats were generated and directly served as the specific templates for the subsequent CuNP formation. The signal readout was easily achieved by dissolving the RCA product-templated CuNPs and detecting the released copper ions with differential pulse stripping voltammetry. Because of the designed cascade signal amplification strategy, the newly developed method achieved a linear range of 0.05-500 fg/mL, with a remarkable detection limit of 0.020 ± 0.001 fg/mL PSA. Finally, the feasibility of the developed method for practical application was investigated by analyzing PSA in the real clinical human serum samples.

There are currently 50 million Latinos in the United States and, by 2050, projected to grow to 128 million. Although some research indicates that Latinos have unique sociocultural beliefs that influence their cancer care, very little is known about their perceptions of coping after being diagnosed with cancer. We examined Latino men and women's perceptions of coping to understand the meaning of their experience with cancer Method: Using criterion sampling technique, 60 immigrant and migrant Latino men and women diagnosed with cancer within the past 5 years were recruited from community-based organizations, clinics, and churches. The study consisted of 60- to 90-minute semistructured interviews asking open-ended questions pertaining to coping. The qualitative design facilitated an understanding of coping within the participants' social and cultural contexts.  Results:   Median age of the participants was 55 years. Among the women, 80% had breast cancer; 12% had ovarian cancer; and 8% had throat, thyroid, stomach, or skin cancers. Among the men, 94% had prostate cancer and 6% had brain, colorectal, or lung cancers. Emerging themes associated with the development of coping strategies involved positive reframing, family support, religion and spirituality, and support from health care providers. The term ""positive reframing"" relates to finding meaning and positive emotions that help sustain the coping process, despite having a cancer diagnosis. In addition, when medical and helping professionals provided tangible support, participants engaged in meaning-based coping.  Conclusion:   This study provides insights regarding the existing coping strategies which Latinos utilize and provides clinician-tangible information pertaining to participant's engagement in meaning-based coping. Family support facilitated coping among the Latino men and women. The role of religion and spirituality in the lives of the participants enabled them to cope with the cancer diagnosis. Future research is necessary to examine coping strategies regarding specific cancers at end of life.""","""['Iraida V Carrion', 'Frances Nedjat-Haiem', 'Melania Macip-Billbe', 'Ryan Black']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Hosp Palliat Care""","""['Pain coping in Latino populations.', 'Understanding the breast cancer experience of Latina women.', 'Saliendo Adelante: Stressors and Coping Strategies Among Immigrant Latino Men Who Have Sex With Men in a Nontraditional Settlement State.', ""Pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality: are health professionals' perceptions of women's coping congruent with women's accounts?"", ""Latino Caregiver Coping With Children's Chronic Health Conditions: An Integrative Literature Review."", 'Importance of Communication Skills Training and Meaning Centered Psychotherapy Concepts among Patients and Caregivers Coping with Advanced Cancer.', 'Family as a Bridge to Improve Meaning in Latinx Individuals Coping with Cancer.', 'Cancer Prevention and Diagnosis Knowledge among Spanish-speaking Older Latino/as Residing in Tampa, Florida.', 'Young Child-Rearing Latina Cancer Survivors Living in the US-Mexico Border Region: A Qualitative Study.', 'Challenges for Latina Breast Cancer Patient Survivorship Care in a Rural US-Mexico Border Region.']"""

Methods:   To evaluate its impact and relationship with key genomic alterations, ELAVL1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers.  Results:   The analysis revealed a mild to moderate predominantly nuclear immunostaining in normal prostate epithelium and an often higher both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in cancer cells. Weak, moderate, and strong cytoplasmic ELAVL1 staining was found in 43%, 18%, and 3% of 10,478 interpretable tumors. Strong ELAVL1 staining was linked to high Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal status, and PSA recurrence (P < 0.0001 each). A combined analysis of the effect of nuclear and cytoplasmic ELAVL1 expression on PSA recurrence revealed that the association with patient outcome was entirely driven by cytoplasmic staining. ELAVL1 positivity was more frequent in cancers harboring TMPRSS2:ERG fusions found by FISH (78%) or showing immunohistochemical ERG expression (74%) than in cancers without ERG rearrangement (63%) or ERG expression (58%, P < 0.0001 each). Strong cytoplasmic ELAVL1 staining was further linked to presence of PTEN, 5q21, 6q15, and 3p13 deletions (P < 0.0001 each), an observation consistent with cytoplasmic ELAVL1 accumulation in case of genomic instability. The prognostic role of ELAVL1 expression was independent of Gleason grade, T stage, N stage, surgical margin status, and preoperative PSA, irrespective of whether preoperative or postoperative variables were used for modeling.

While the disparity may result from multiple factors, a biological basis is often strongly suspected. Currently, few well-characterized experimental model systems are available to study the biological basis of racial disparity in PCa. We report a validated in vitro cell line model system that could be used for the purpose.  Methods:   We assembled a PCa cell line model that included currently available African-American PCa cell lines and LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and C4-2 (castration-resistant) Caucasian PCa cells. The utility of the cell lines in studying the biological basis of variance in a malignant phenotype was explored using a multiplex biomarker panel consisting of proteins that have been proven to play a role in the progression of PCa. The panel expression was evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR in cell lines and validated in human PCa tissues by RT-PCR. As proof-of-principle to demonstrate the utility of our model in functional studies, we performed MTS viability assays and molecular studies.  Results:   The dysregulation of the multiplex biomarker panel in primary African-American cell line (E006AA) was similar to metastatic Caucasian cell lines, which would suggest that the cell line model could be used to study an inherent aggressive phenotype in African-American men with PCa. We had previously demonstrated that Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a novel kinase that is down regulated in advanced prostate cancer. We established the functional relevance by over expressing PKD1, which resulted in decreased proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa cells. Moreover, we established the feasibility of studying the expression of the multiplex biomarker panel in archived human PCa tissue from African-Americans and Caucasians as a prelude to future translational studies.  Conclusion:   We have characterized a novel in vitro cell line model that could be used to study the biological basis of disparity in PCa between African-Americans and Caucasians.""","""['Bita NickKholgh', 'Xiaolan Fang', 'Shira M Winters', 'Anvi Raina', 'Komal S Pandya', 'Kenneth Gyabaah', 'Nora Fino', 'K C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Differential expression of miR-34b and androgen receptor pathway regulate prostate cancer aggressiveness between African-Americans and Caucasians.', 'Establishment and characterization of a highly tumorigenic African American prostate cancer cell line, E006AA-hT.', 'Exosome proteomic analyses identify inflammatory phenotype and novel biomarkers in African American prostate cancer patients.', 'Molecular basis for prostate cancer racial disparities.', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines initiate multiple prostate cancer biologic pathways of cellular proliferation, heterogeneity and metastasis in a racially diverse population and underlie the genetic/biologic mechanism of racial disparity: Update.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis and health disparities: a systematic review.', 'Protein Kinase D 1 Predicts Poor Treatment Response and Unfavorable Survival of Bortezomib-Based Treatment, and Its Knockdown Enhances Drug Sensitivity to Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma.', 'Identification of candidate miRNAs in early-onset and late-onset prostate cancer by network analysis.', 'Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates: Solvable or not?', 'Association of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition with prostate and breast health disparities.']"""

During follow-up (median, 21 years), 3,284 deaths occurred; prostate cancer was the underlying cause of 107. In multivariable models, compared with no balding, any baldness was associated with a 56% higher risk of fatal prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 1.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.37), and moderate balding specifically was associated with an 83% higher risk (hazard ratio = 1.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 2.92).

The Eclipse (v11) treatment planning system was used to plan therapy in 9 patients with head and neck cancer, 5 patients with prostate cancer, and 5 patients with brain cancer with VMAT and static-field IMRT. The mean skin dose and the maximum dose to a contiguous volume of 2cm(3) for head and neck plans and brain plans and a contiguous volume of 5cm(3) for pelvis plans were compared for each treatment technique. Of the 9 patients with head and neck cancer, 3 underwent an integrated boost regimen. One integrated boost plan was replanned with IMRT and VMAT using a traditional boost regimen. For target sites located in the head and neck, VMAT reduced the mean dose and contiguous hot spot most noticeably in the shoulder region by 5.6% and 5.4%, respectively. When using an integrated boost regimen, the contiguous hot spot skin dose in the shoulder was larger on average than a traditional boost pattern by 26.5% and the mean skin dose was larger by 1.7%. VMAT techniques largely decrease the contiguous hot spot in the skin in the pelvis by an average of 36% compared with IMRT. For the same target coverage, VMAT can reduce the skin dose in all the regions of the body, but more noticeably in the shoulders in patients with head and neck and pelvis cancer.

While there is preclinical data indicating that bisphosphonates such as Zol have direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, such effect has not been firmly established in the clinical setting. This is likely due to the rapid absorption of bisphosphonates by the skeleton after intravenous (i.v.) administration. Herein, we report the reformulation of Zol using nanotechnology and evaluation of this novel nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs) formulation of Zol as an anticancer agent. The nMOF formulation is comprised of a calcium zoledronate (CaZol) core and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface. To preferentially deliver CaZol nMOFs to tumors as well as facilitate cellular uptake of Zol, we incorporated folate (Fol)-targeted ligands on the nMOFs. The folate receptor (FR) is known to be overexpressed in several tumor types, including head-and-neck, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers. We demonstrated that these targeted CaZol nMOFs possess excellent chemical and colloidal stability in physiological conditions. The release of encapsulated Zol from the nMOFs occurs in the mid-endosomes during nMOF endocytosis. In vitro toxicity studies demonstrated that Fol-targeted CaZol nMOFs are more efficient than small molecule Zol in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in FR-overexpressing H460 non-small cell lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Our findings were further validated in vivo using mouse xenograft models of H460 and PC3. We demonstrated that Fol-targeted CaZol nMOFs are effective anticancer agents and increase the direct antitumor activity of Zol by 80-85% in vivo through inhibition of tumor neovasculature, and inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.""","""['Kin Man Au', 'Andrew Satterlee', 'Yuanzeng Min', 'Xi Tian', 'Young Seok Kim', 'Joseph M Caster', 'Longzhen Zhang', 'Tian Zhang', 'Leaf Huang', 'Andrew Z Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Liposome encapsulation of zoledronic acid results in major changes in tissue distribution and increase in toxicity.', 'Nanoparticles for the delivery of zoledronic acid to prostate cancer cells: a comparative analysis through time lapse video-microscopy technique.', 'Evaluation of antitumor effect of zoledronic acid entrapped in folate-linked liposome for targeting to tumor-associated macrophages.', 'Zoledronic acid - a multiplicity of anti-cancer action.', 'Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks for biomedical imaging and drug delivery.', 'Nanomaterial-assisted theranosis of bone diseases.', 'Zoledronic Acid Implant Coating Results in Local Medullary Bone Growth.', 'The uptake of metal-organic frameworks: a journey into the cell.', 'High affinity zoledronate-based metal complex nanocrystals to potentially treat osteolytic metastases.', 'A facile aqueous production of bisphosphonated-polyelectrolyte functionalized magnetite nanoparticles for pH-specific targeting of acidic-bone cells.']"""

We aimed to use CaP clinical registry data to evaluate variation in patient adverse effects after EBRT in Victoria.  Methods:   Study subjects were men diagnosed with primary CaP between 2009 and 2014, treated with EBRT in metropolitan Melbourne, or in one of three regional integrated cancer service (ICS) regions. Information on change in general and disease-specific health outcome 12 and 24 months after the initial diagnosis were obtained using a modified Expanded CaP index composite (EPIC)-26 survey and there was no variation of follow up between ICSs.  Results:   The proportion of men with 'big bother' (the most troublesome category) was compared between the ICS regions in Victoria (n = 1,825). There was no difference in big bother in urinary and sexual function across the regions at 24 months. However, patients treated in one regional cancer service had a higher proportion with 'big bother' (11.1%) compared with the rest of the Victoria (4.8%); (χ(2) = 4.85; P = 0.02). The only significant factor for this was the location of EBRT (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-6.04; P = 0.02). There was no association over time in that region with change in EBRT technique from 3-D conformal radiation therapy to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (z-test for proportion: 0.77; P: 0.44).

SPOP mutations are frequent in prostate cancer, and in a previous study, An et al. demonstrated that SPOP induced the degradation of the androgen receptor (AR) suggesting that SPOP is important in maintaining prostate homeostasis. In this current highlighted report, An and colleagues showed that ERG, which has been implicated as an oncoprotein in prostate cancer, contains putative SPOP-binding consensus (SBC) motifs 42ASSSS46 and 423VTSSS427 in the N- and C-terminal of ERG, respectively. The authors went on to demonstrate that SPOP promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of ERG through binding to the degron/SBC motif at the ERG N-terminus. SPOP mutations in the MATH domain prevented recognition and targeting of ERG for ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, N-terminal truncated ERG proteins encoded by the most frequently identified TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer (T1-E4 and T1-E5) were resistant to SPOP-mediated degradation, resulting in the stabilization of truncated ERG proteins. Stabilization of ERG protein through either SPOP mutation or TMPRSS2-ERG fusions induced proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer cells. This study along with a recently published similar report provides two previously unrecognized mechanisms for the upregulation of ERG proteins frequently observed in prostate cancers. These findings generate great enthusiasm for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies designed to eliminate ERG protein in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Laura E Pascal', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Destruction of full-length androgen receptor by wild-type SPOP, but not prostate-cancer-associated mutants.', 'Truncated ERG Oncoproteins from TMPRSS2-ERG Fusions Are Resistant to SPOP-Mediated Proteasome Degradation.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Noninvasive detection of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts in the urine of men with prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'Truncated ERG proteins affect the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.']"""

We examined the effects of Medicare eligibility on the appropriate use of cancer screening services in the United States.  Methods:   We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014). Univariable and logistic regression analyses were performed for participants aged 60-64 and 66-70 to examine the effects of Medicare eligibility on prevalence of self-reported screening for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. Sub-analyses were performed among low-income (<$25,000 annual/household) individuals.  Results:   Medicare-eligible individuals were significantly more likely to undergo all examined preventive services (colorectal cancer OR: 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.04; prostate cancer OR: 1.29; 95% CI 1.17-1.43; breast cancer OR: 1.23; 95% CI 1.10-1.37) and the effect was most pronounced among low-income individuals (colorectal cancer OR: 2.04; 95% CI 1.8-2.32; prostate cancer OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.12-1.72; breast cancer OR: 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.67). Access to a healthcare provider was the strongest independent predictor of undergoing appropriate screening, ranging from OR 2.73 (95% CI 2.20-3.39) for colorectal cancer screening in the low-income population to OR 4.79 (95% CI 3.95-5.81) for breast cancer screening in the overall cohort. The difference in screening prevalence was most pronounced when comparing Medicare-eligible participants to uninsured Medicare-ineligible participants (+33.2%).  Conclusions:   Medicare eligibility impacts the prevalence of cancer screening, likely as a result of increased access to primary care. Low-income individuals benefit most from Medicare eligibility. Expanded public insurance coverage to these individuals may improve access to preventive services.""","""['Christian P Meyer', 'Christopher B Allard', 'Jesse D Sammon', 'Julian Hanske', 'Julia McNabb-Baltar', 'Joel E Goldberg', 'Gally Reznor', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Joel S Weissman', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prev Med""","""['Determinants of cancer screening in Asian-Americans.', 'Understanding the role of access in Hispanic cancer screening disparities.', 'Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancer Screening Adherence: Effect of Low Body Mass Index in Women.', 'The Affordable Care Act and access to care across the cancer control continuum: A review at 10\xa0years.', 'Cancer screening in the United States, 2009: a review of current American Cancer Society guidelines and issues in cancer screening.', 'Health Insurance Coverage and Survival Outcomes among Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients: A SEER Retrospective Analysis.', 'Effects of Medicare eligibility and enrollment at age 65\u2009years on the use of high-value and low-value care.', 'Surveillance Patterns for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among Screening-Eligible Patients in the Medicare Population.', 'Phenotype Discovery and Geographic Disparities of Late-Stage Breast Cancer Diagnosis across U.S. Counties: A Machine Learning Approach.', 'Determinants of self-rated health among an older Tibetan population in a Chinese plateau area: analysis based on the conceptual framework for determinants of health.']"""

Methods:   We identified 52 905 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database between 1991 and 2006. We compared those who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy with those who received androgen deprivation therapy within 2 years of diagnosis, calculated as monthly equivalent doses (<7, 7-11, >11 doses), or orchiectomy. Adjusted Cox hazard models were fitted to predict the risk of community-acquired respiratory infections (acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, [severe] pneumonia) in patients treated with medical androgen deprivation therapy versus orchiectomy versus none.  Results:   Overall, 43.4% received medical androgen deprivation therapy. These patients more likely experienced respiratory events compared with those who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy or who underwent orchiectomy (62.2% vs 54.5% vs 47.8%, P < 0.001). The risk of experiencing any respiratory event increased with the number of doses received. For example, men receiving >11 doses of androgen deprivation therapy were at greatest risk of acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis and pneumonia (HR 1.13, 1.26 and 1.15, respectively, all P < 0.001), except severe pneumonia. Furthermore, we did not detect any relationship between orchiectomy and respiratory events. Study limitations include the utilization of a retrospective population-based dataset.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analysed 429 bone scans of 281 patients with CRPC, with no known previous metastases, treated at three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We assessed the predictors of a positive scan using generalized estimating equations. Area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots and decision-curve analysis were used to assess the performance of our previous model to predict a positive scan in the current data.  Results:   A total of 113 scans (26%) were positive. On multivariable analysis, the only significant predictors of a positive scan were log-transformed prostate-specific antigen (PSA): hazard ratio (HR) 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71-2.66 (P < 0.001) and log-transformed PSA doubling time (PSADT): HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.41-0.68 (P < 0.001). Among men with a PSA level <5 ng/mL, the rate of positive scans was 5%. The previously developed risk table had an AUC of 0.735 to predict positive bone scan with excellent calibration, and provided additional net benefit in the decision-curve analysis.  Conclusion:   We have validated our previously developed table to predict the risk of a positive bone scan among men with M0/Mx CRPC.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a cohort study using the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, including 22 344 men with localized prostate cancer of clinical stage T1-T3, whose prostate-specific antigen levels were <50 μg/mL and who had undergone primary radical prostatectomy in the period 1998-2012. Vital status was ascertained through the Total Population Register. The rates for 90-day postoperative mortality were analysed using logistic regression analysis, and comparisons of 90-day mortality with the background population were made using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).  Results:   Of the 14 820 men who underwent RRP, 29 (0.20%) died, and of the 7 524 men who underwent RARP, 10 (0.13%) died. Mortality in the cohort during the 90-day postoperative period was lower than in an age-matched background population: SMR 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.75). There was no statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality according to surgical method: RARP vs RRP odds ratio (OR) 1.14; 95% CI 0.46-2.81. Postoperative 90-day mortality decreased over time: 2008-2012 vs 1998-2007 OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21-0.95, mainly because of lower mortality after RARP.  Conclusion:   The 90-day postoperative mortality rates were low after RARP and RRP and there was no statistically significant difference between the methods. Given the long life expectancy among men with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, very low postoperative mortality is a prerequisite for RP, which was fulfilled by both RRP and RARP.

Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.  Design:   This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.  Setting:   The study was performed in our outpatients center.  Population:   Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.  Methods:   Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG). The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).  Results:   No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment. After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG. Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before. Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.  Conclusions:   Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.  Clinical rehabilitation impact:   This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.""","""['Katarzyna Hojan', 'Eliza Kwiatkowska-Borowczyk', 'Ewa Leporowska', 'Maciej Górecki', 'Owidia Ozga-Majchrzak', 'Tomasz Milecki', 'Piotr Milecki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Phys Rehabil Med""","""['Inflammation, cardiometabolic markers, and functional changes in men with prostate cancer.

Many of the patients followed for their prostate cancer are elderly and have a higher rate of nonprostate cancer lesions or malignancies. As our experience with choline PET/CT has grown, it has become apparent that many of these nonprostate cancer processes, both benign and malignant, can be detected. Invasive thymoma, renal cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and parathyroid adenoma are a few of the processes that have been incidentally detected with (11)C-choline PET/CT at our institution and have significantly altered subsequent clinical management of the patient. Although most of the secondary lesions are detected due to their increased (11)C-choline avidity, several have been detected due to their decreased or lack of avidity in the background of a highly avid organ. For instance, large liver masses that are relatively non-choline-avid create large activity defects in the otherwise highly active liver. Familiarity with normal (11)C-choline physiologic activity, the most common prostate metastatic patterns, and imaging characteristics of secondary lesions is essential for the detection and correct diagnosis of such lesions so that proper follow-up and management can be recommended.""","""['Christopher L Welle', 'Ethany L Cullen', 'Patrick J Peller', 'Val J Lowe', 'Robert C Murphy', 'Geoffrey B Johnson', 'Larry A Binkovitz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiographics""","""['(11)CCholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography for staging and restaging of patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Detection of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: comparison of 11C-choline PET/CT with pelvic multiparametric MR imaging with endorectal coil.', 'Detection of second tumors in 11C-choline PET/CT studies performed due to biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Choline PET/CT for imaging prostate cancer: an update.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Precision Oncology Era.', 'Prostate Cancer-PET Imaging Update.', 'Application of Metabolic Reprogramming to Cancer Imaging and Diagnosis.', 'Incidental Findings on 18 F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for Parathyroid Imaging.', 'Preoperative Imaging with 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in Primary Hyperparathyroidism.']"""

Methods:   In a retrospective cross-sectional validation study, 100 patients on AS for PCa underwent a systematic 12-core TRUS-bx (the gold standard) as well as mpMRI, on either a 1.5 or 3 Tesla scanner (32 and 68 patients, respectively). Three pathologists reported biopsy histology separately. A single, experienced radiologist scored mpMRI scans using the PI-RADS system. We compared left- and right-sided PI-RADS scores of the peripheral zone with TRUS-bx results of the relevant prostate lobe. We then estimated the specificity and sensitivity of mpMRI in diagnosing low-grade low-risk PCa in our AS cohort.  Results:   The sensitivity of mpMRI was 37% (95% CI 28-47%) and specificity was 85% (CI 76-92%) for cancer. The negative predictive value was 51% (CI 44-60%), and the positive predictive value was 76% (CI 62-87%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.5 and 0.7, respectively.  Conclusion:   Because of its low specificity and low negative predictive value, mpMRI is not suitable for diagnosing low-grade small-volume PCa.

The aim of this study was to develop a cancer-specific modified MPI (Onco-MPI) for mortality prediction in older cancer patients.  Methods:   We enrolled 658 new cancer subjects ≥70 years (mean age 77.1 years, 433 females, 65.8 %) attending oncological outpatient services from September 2004 to June 2011. The Onco-MPI was calculated according to a validated algorithm as a weighted linear combination of the following CGA domains: age, sex, basal and instrumental activities of daily living, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, mini-mental state examination, body mass index, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, number of drugs and the presence of caregiver. Cancer sites (breast 46.5 %, colorectal 21.3 %, lung 6.4 %, prostate 5.5 %, urinary tract 5.0 %, other 15.3 %) and cancer stages (I 37 %, II 22 %, III 19 %, IV 22 %) were also included in the model. All-cause mortality was recorded. Three grades of severity of the Onco-MPI score (low risk: 0.0-0.46, medium risk: 0.47-0.63, high risk: 0.64-1.0) were calculated using RECPAM method. Discriminatory power and calibration were assessed by estimating survival C-indices, along with 95 % confidence interval (CI) and the survival-based Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) measures.  Results:   One-year mortality incidence rate was 17.4 %.

Methods:   In vivo animal experiments were performed on graft prostatic cancer (PC3) tumours in immunodeficient mice to investigate whether lowering ferrofluid infusion rate improves control of the distribution of magnetic nanoparticles in tumour tissue. Nanoparticle distribution volume obtained from micro-CT scan was used to evaluate spreading of the nanoparticles from the injection site in tumours. Heating experiments were performed to quantify relationships among micro-CT HU values, local nanoparticle concentrations in the tumours, and the ferrofluid-induced volumetric heat generation rate (q(MNH)) when nanoparticles were subject to an alternating magnetic field.  Results:   An infusion rate of 3 µL/min was identified to result in the most repeatable nanoparticle distribution in PC3 tumours. Linear relationships have been obtained to first convert micro-CT greyscale values to HU values, then to local nanoparticle concentrations, and finally to nanoparticle-induced q(MNH) values. The total energy deposition rate in tumours was calculated and the observed similarity in total energy deposition rates in all three infusion rate groups suggests improvement in minimising nanoparticle leakage from the tumours. The results of this study demonstrate that micro-CT generated q(MNH) distribution and tumour physical models improve predicting capability of heat transfer simulation for designing reliable treatment protocols using magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.""","""['Alexander LeBrun', 'Tejashree Joglekar', 'Charles Bieberich', 'Ronghui Ma', 'Liang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['MicroCT image based simulation to design heating protocols in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for cancer treatment.', 'MicroCT image-generated tumour geometry and SAR distribution for tumour temperature elevation simulations in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.', 'Nanoparticle distribution and temperature elevations in prostatic tumours in mice during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.', 'A review on hyperthermia via nanoparticle-mediated therapy.', 'Cancer hyperthermia using magnetic nanoparticles.', 'Validation of a coupled electromagnetic and thermal model for estimating temperatures during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.', 'Feasibility of CT quantification of intratumoural 166Ho-microspheres.', 'Three-dimensional microstructure of human alveolar trabecular bone: a micro-computed tomography study.']"""

Here, we found that PMEPA1 was upregulated in breast cancer cell lines as well as in a set of clinical invasive breast ductal carcinomas. Interestingly, depletion of PMEPA1 decreased breast cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched populations, while ectopic overexpression of PMEPA1 increased breast CSC-enriched populations. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) treatment was also found to upregulate PMEPA1 expression and the CSC-enriched populations in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.

These patients are thought to have higher postoperative morbidity and an increased rate of tumour progression. The aim of the present study was to analyse oncological, functional and perioperative outcomes in Tx patients following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   Between 1996 and 2014, 30 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer underwent RP at our institution following Tx (kidney: n = 20, heart: n = 5, liver: n = 5). Functional, oncological and perioperative follow-ups were analysed. Postoperative complications were assessed using the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   Median follow-up was 45 months. Median PSA was 5.3 ng/ml. Intraoperative blood loss was 600 ml at a median operating time of 180 min. Surgery in kidney Tx patients was technically feasible. Major complications occurred in 3 patients (ureteral injury, lymphocele and haematoma). Histological evaluation revealed n = 18 ≤pT2 tumours (60.0 %), n = 7 pT3a tumours (23.3 %) and n = 5 ≥pT3b tumours (16.7 %). Continence rate 12 months after surgery, defined as no or one safety pad use, was 73.3 %, while 93.3 % of the patients used ≤2 pads/24 h. After the median follow-up of 45 months, BCR-free survival was 69.0 %. In recurrent men, there was suspicion of metastasis in one patient. No cancer-specific death was observed. Five-year overall survival was 94.4 %.  Conclusion:   The complication rate in patients with solid organ transplantation after RP was low. While histopathological evaluation revealed disease characteristics comparable to non-transplant patients from current RP series, postoperative continence was worse. Immunosuppressive therapy does not seem to lead to an increased rate of tumour progression.""","""['Burkhard Beyer', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Uwe Michl', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Valia Veleva', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Functional and oncological outcome of salvage prostatectomy of locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy.', 'Salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer: verification of European Association of Urology guideline criteria.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after open and minimally invasive prostate cancer surgery: experience from Australasia.', 'Determinants of self-reported functional status (EPIC-26) in prostate cancer patients prior to treatment.']"""

Previous work indicates that the anti-androgenic mechanism of p-nitrophenol is complex and may involve several components in the AR signaling pathway, but the molecular details of how p-nitrophenol inhibits AR signaling are still not quite clear. Here, we characterized p-nitrophenol binds to the FK1 domain of an AR positive regulator FKBP51 with micromolar affinity and structural analysis of FK1 domain in complex with p-nitrophenol revealed that p-nitrophenol occupies a hydrophobic FK1 pocket that is vital for AR activity enhancement. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that p-nitrophenol is stably bound to the FK1 pocket and the hotspot residues that involved p-nitrophenol binding are mainly hydrophobic and overlap with the AR interaction site. Furthermore, we showed that p-nitrophenol inhibits the androgen-dependent growth of human prostate cancer cells, possibly through down-regulating the expression levels of AR activated downstream genes. Taken together, our data suggests that p-nitrophenol suppresses the AR signaling pathway at least in part by blocking the interaction between AR and its positive regulator FKBP51.

Patients and methods:   We relied on the Martini-Clinic database and focused on prostate cancer patients treated in 2013. Characteristics in ORP and RARP patients were assessed. In multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA), we predicted RARP treatment.  Results:   Of 1,920 patients, 575 (29.9%) underwent RARP and 1,345 (70.1%) ORP. RARP patients had a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and were less likely to harbor pT3b, pathological Gleason ≥4 + 4 or lymph node metastases (all p < 0.05). Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) (84.3 vs. 87.0%, p = 0.1), as well as positive surgical margins (15.5 vs. 15.7%, p = 0.7) and the nerve-sparing status (p = 0.5) were comparable between RARP and ORP. Lymph node yield (median 11 vs. 16), and median blood loss (250 vs. 700 ml) were lower at RARP (all p < 0.001). Additionally, the median operating room time was higher at RARP (215 vs. 185 min, p < 0.001). In MVA, patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 were more likely to undergo RARP (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4, p < 0.001). Conversely, patients with PSA >20 ng/ml were less likely to undergo RARP (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0, p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   More favorable pathological characteristics were recorded at RARP.

Patients and methods:   Consenting patients completed the 26-item Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, the International Prostate Symptom Score, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale, and a global question about willingness to have a repeat TPbx in a years' time. The instruments were scored using published scoring methods. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to investigate statistically significant differences. Clinically significant differences were also investigated defined by published minimal important differences for the EPIC-26 and changes in established categorical groups for the other instruments.  Results:   In all, 53 patients consented to participate and completed the baseline questionnaire, in addition to at least one of the 1- or 3-month follow-up questionnaires. We found that most patients having a TPbx had no clinically significant change in QoL in the first 3 months after TPbx.

At 3 months, 3% of patients had clinically worse urinary function and 25% continued to have worse sexual function compared with baseline.

To uncover new causative genes, exome sequencing was performed using DNA from leukocytes and a total of 12 colorectal adenomas from seven unrelated patients with unexplained sporadic adenomatous polyposis. For data analysis and variant filtering, an established bioinformatics pipeline including in-house tools was applied. Variants were filtered for rare truncating point mutations and copy-number variants assuming a dominant, recessive, or tumor suppressor model of inheritance. Subsequently, targeted sequence analysis of the most promising candidate genes was performed in a validation cohort of 191 unrelated patients. All relevant variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The analysis of exome sequencing data resulted in the identification of rare loss-of-function germline mutations in three promising candidate genes (DSC2, PIEZO1, ZSWIM7). In the validation cohort, further variants predicted to be pathogenic were identified in DSC2 and PIEZO1. According to the somatic mutation spectra, the adenomas in this patient cohort follow the classical pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a case-control study including 995 men with PCa (cases) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1997 and 2011 at the Department of Urology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. As controls, we used 1622 healthy men with a normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) level.  Results:   The HOXB13 G84E mutation was identified in 0.49% of controls and in 2.51% of PCa cases. The mutation was associated with a 5.12-fold increased relative risk (RR) of PCa (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26-13.38; P = 13 × 10(-6) ). Furthermore, carriers of the risk allele were significantly more likely to have a higher PSA level at diagnosis (mean PSA 19.9 vs 13.6 ng/mL; P = 0.032), a pathological Gleason score ≥7 (83.3 vs 60.9%; P = 0.032), and positive surgical margins (56.0 vs 28.5%; P = 0.006) than non-carriers. Risk allele carriers were also more likely to have aggressive disease (54.2 vs 28.6%; P = 0.011), as defined by a preoperative PSA ≥20 ng/mL, pathological Gleason score ≥ (4+3) and/or presence of regional/distant disease. At a mean follow-up of 7 months, we found no significant association between HOXB13 mutation status and biochemical recurrence in this cohort of men who underwent RP.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to investigate the HOXB13 G84E mutation in Danish men. The mutation was detected in 0.49% of controls and in 2.51% of cases, and was associated with 5.12-fold increased RR of being diagnosed with PCa. In our RP cohort, HOXB13 mutation carriers were more likely to develop aggressive PCa.

Treatment with AA in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may partly mediate neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) as an escape mechanism, which may have implications for the choice of sequential therapy in CRPC. We evaluated how treatment with AA influences circulating neuromediators chromogranin A (CGA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients.  Methods:   We conducted an analysis in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients with clinical or radiographic progression of disease. A total of 35 patients were included at five institutions between February 2013 and December 2014. Sixteen of them had received AA. Serum samples were obtained before a docetaxel-based chemotherapy and analyzed in a reference laboratory. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to test the influence of AA treatment, its duration of treatment, and other clinicopathological variables on circulating neuromediators.  Results:   CGA and NSE levels were above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in n = 20 (57.1%) and n = 13 (37.1%), respectively. Treatment with AA and duration of treatment were not associated with levels above the ULN (CGA and NSE) or higher levels (Pro-GRP) of neuromediators. CGA levels were associated with age (P = 0.092), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.014), duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; P = 0.083), and intake of proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.069). Pro-GRP levels were significantly associated with PSA levels (P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, CGA levels above the ULN were significantly correlated with ADT (P = 0.01) and intake of proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Circulating neuromediators in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients were elevated in a high percentage of patients. ADT was found to be a relevant NED driver in this cohort. Our results may imply that patients with CRPC after first-line treatment with AA in CRPC are not at a higher risk for developing NED. The major limitation of the study represents the one-time analysis of neuromediators. Larger studies with serial blood measurements or biopsy analysis before and after treatment are needed to confirm our results.""","""['Jost von Hardenberg', 'Maike Schwartz', 'Thorsten Werner', 'Stefan Fuxius', 'Markus Müller', 'Christian Bolenz', 'Christel Weiß', 'Elmar Heinrich']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Influence of abiraterone acetate on neuroendocrine differentiation in chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chromogranin A and neurone-specific enolase variations during the first 3 months of abiraterone therapy predict outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Evaluation of Neuromediator Dynamics in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients During Docetaxel.', 'Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of abiraterone acetate for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who have progressed after abiraterone acetate.', 'Chromogranin A: a useful biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Plasma progastrin-releasing peptide level shows different predictive profiles for treatment response by androgen receptor axis-targeted agents in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling and the Emergence of Lethal Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer With the Treatment-Induced Suppression of the Androgen Receptor: A Literature Review.']"""

Lycopene significantly inhibited prostate and breast cancer cell growth at physiologically relevant concentrations of ≥1.25 μM. Similar concentrations also caused a 30-40 % reduction in inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) phosphorylation in the cells, as determined by western blotting. Furthermore, the same degree of inhibition by lycopene was observed for NF-κB transcriptional activity, as determined by reporter gene assay. Concomitant with this, immunofluorescence staining of lycopene-treated cells showed a significant suppression (≥25 %) of TNF-induced NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear translocation. Further probing of lycopene's effects on upstream elements of the NF-κB pathway showed a 25 % inhibition of both activity of recombinant IκB kinase β (IKKβ) kinase in a cell-free in vitro assay, as well as activity of IKKβ immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with lycopene. In conclusion, the anticancer properties of lycopene may occur through inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, beginning at the early stage of cytoplasmic IKK kinase activity, which then leads to reduced NF-κB-responsive gene regulation.

It is rapidly increasing. This study investigated the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer and the relationship with the Human Development Index (HDI) and its dimensions in Asia in 2012.  Methods:   The study was conducted based on data from the world data of cancer and the World Bank (including the HDI and its components). The standardized incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer were calculated for Asian countries. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI and its components were assessed with the use of the correlation test, using SPSS software.  Results:   There was a total of 191,054 incidences and 81,229 death were recorded in Asian countries in 2012. Among the Asian countries, the five countries with the highest standardized incidence rates of prostate cancer were Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, Singapore, and Japan, and the five countries with the highest standardized mortality rates were Turkey, Lebanon, Timor-Leste, Armenia, and the Philippines. The correlation between standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer and the HDI was 0.604 (P ≤ 0.001), with life expectancy at birth 0.529 (P = 0.002), with mean years of schooling 0.427 (P = 0.001), and with level of income per each person of the population 0.349 (P = 0.013). Also, between the standardized mortality rate and the HDI, it was 0.228 (P = 0.127).  Conclusions:   A significant and positive correlation was observed between the standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer, and the HDI and its dimensions, such as life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, and income level of the population per each person of population.

We describe the incidence of ulcers and fistulas, and associated risk factors.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 4,690 patients with localized prostate cancer who were treated with low dose rate (125)I prostate brachytherapy to a dose of 144 Gy with or without 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Patient, disease, comorbidity, treatment, dosimetric and posttreatment intervention factors were analyzed for an association with ulcer or fistula formation.  Results:   At a median followup of 53 months 21 cases were identified, including 15 rectal ulcer cases, of which 6 progressed to fistulas, and an additional 6 cases of fistulas with no prior documented ulcers. Overall 9 rectal ulcer cases (0.19%) and 12 fistula cases (0.26%) were identified. In 8 of 15 patients ulcers healed with conservative management. No fistulas healed without surgical management. Two patients with fistulas died. Eight patients diagnosed with rectal ulcers subsequently underwent rectal biopsies, after which fistulas developed in 3. One patient with a de novo fistula underwent a preceding biopsy. Urinary interventions such as transurethral resection of the prostate were performed after brachytherapy in 5 of 12 patients with fistulas compared to 0 of 9 with ulcers alone. Argon plasma coagulation of the rectum for hematochezia was performed after brachytherapy in 3 of 12 patients with fistulas.  Conclusions:   Rates of post-brachytherapy rectal ulcers and fistulas are low as previously described.

Aim of the study:   The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity, as well as the cytotoxic, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and sedative effects of an ethanol extract from Costus pulverulentus stem (CPE).  Materials and methods:   The chemical characterization of CPE was performed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The toxicity of CPE was evaluated using the comet assay (10-1000 µg/ml during 5h) and the acute toxicity test (500-5000 mg/kg p.o. and i.p. during 14 days). The cytotoxic effect of CPE (1-250 µg/ml) on human cancer cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. The antinociceptive effects of CPE (50-200mg/kg p.o.) were evaluated using thermal-induced nociception tests (hot plate and tail flick) and the chemical-induced nociceptive tests (acetic acid and formalin). The sedative activity of CPE (50-200mg/kg p.o.) was evaluated using the ketamine-induced sleeping time test.  Results:   CPE showed the presence of compounds such as campesterol, stigmasterol β-sitosterol, vanillic acid, among others. In the comet assay, CPE at 200 µg/ml or higher concentrations induced DNA damage. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 estimated for CPE was>5000 mg/kg p.o. or i.p. CEP showed moderate cytotoxic effects on prostate carcinoma cells PC-3 cells (IC50=179 ± 23.2 µg/ml). In the chemical-induced nociception models, CPE (100 and 200mg/kg p.o.) showed antinociceptive effects with similar activity to 100mg/kg naproxen. In the thermal-induced nociception tests, CPE tested at 200mg/kg showed moderate antinociceptive effects by 28% (hot plate test) and by 25% (tail flick test). In the ketamine-induced sleeping time test, CPE showed no sedative effects.

Patients and methods:   We identified 302 patients from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute patient registry who had been diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer (T3a or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] > 20 ng/mL or Gleason score 8-10) from 1993 to 2015. We assessed the intended duration of ADT and used multivariable Cox regression to evaluate the predictors of receiving a shorter course of ADT than recommended by the guidelines (< 2 years).  Results:   The course of ADT intended by physicians increased after the 2008/2009 publication of trials showing the superiority of long-term versus short-term ADT, with 43.5% intending ≥ 2 years before versus 61.4% after (P = .014). Starting in 2010, 49.4% of patients actually received < 2 years of ADT. The most common reasons for receipt of shorter course ADT were intolerance of ADT side effects, patient comorbidity/age, the presence of T3a on magnetic resonance imaging only as the sole high-risk feature, or participation in a clinical trial. Moderate to severe comorbidity assessed using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 2.94), Gleason score < 8 (AHR = 5.66), and PSA < 20 ng/mL (AHR = 4.19) all predicted for receipt of shorter course ADT (P < .05 for all).  Conclusion:   In a tertiary-care setting, the rates of long-course ADT for high-risk disease have increased since the 2008/2009 trials supporting its use. However, approximately one half of patients continued to receive shorter course ADT, often because of intolerance of side effects, underlying comorbidity, or physician judgment about the aggressiveness of the disease.""","""['Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Meredith M Regan', 'Lillian Werner', 'Mari Nakabayashi', 'Carolyn P Evan', 'Joaquim Bellmunt', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Aymen A Elfiky', 'Lauren C Harshman', 'Rana R McKay', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Variation in National Use of Long-Term ADT by Disease Aggressiveness Among Men With Unfavorable-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors associated with the omission of androgen deprivation therapy in radiation-managed high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Improving the management of patients with prostate cancer receiving long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Combined Modality Therapies for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Narrative Review of Current Understanding and New Directions.', 'The use of Hormonal Therapy to Augment Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer: An Update.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 2009 and 2011, 333 patients aged≥70 years with mCRPC were enrolled in a prospective international registry. Patients were categorized as having received taxane-based or nontaxane therapy, and classified as fit, vulnerable, frail, or terminal, according to investigator judgement or International Society of Geriatric Oncology guidelines. Efficacy measures included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. Grade 3/4 toxicities were recorded. Predictors of OS were identified using multivariate Cox regression.  Results:   The proportions of fit/vulnerable/frail patients were 65%/14%/17% (International Society of Geriatric Oncology), and 39%/43%/17% (investigator). In single-factor analyses, taxane therapy improved OS (hazard ratio [95%CI] = 0.53 [0.30-0.93]; P = 0.027) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.55 [0.40-0.76]; P<0.001) vs. nontaxane therapy. Patients with frailty also benefited from taxane therapy (adapted regimen in 52%). In multivariate analysis, taxanes improved OS even with poor prognostic factors present (P = 0.017); age was unrelated to prognosis. Taxane therapy was well tolerated; most common grade 3/4 toxicities (taxane vs. nontaxane) were fatigue (17% vs. 4%), nausea/vomiting (14% vs. 5%) and neutropenia (10% vs. 1%).  Conclusions:   The results of this nonrandomized, observational study suggest that first-line taxane therapy may benefit senior adults with mCRPC more than alternative therapies.

Objective:   To determine the clinical safety and feasibility of MRI-TULSA for whole-gland prostate ablation in a primary treatment setting of localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-arm prospective phase 1 study was performed at three tertiary referral centers in Canada, Germany, and the United States. Thirty patients (median age: 69 yr; interquartile range [IQR]: 67-71 yr) with biopsy-proven low-risk (80%) and intermediate-risk (20%) PCa were treated and followed for 12 mo.  Intervention:   MRI-TULSA treatment was delivered with the therapeutic intent of conservative whole-gland ablation including 3-mm safety margins and 10% residual viable prostate expected around the capsule.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary end points were safety (adverse events) and feasibility (technical accuracy and precision of conformal thermal ablation). Exploratory outcomes included quality of life, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and biopsy at 12 mo.  Results and limitations:   Median treatment time was 36min (IQR: 26-44) and prostate volume was 44ml (IQR: 38-48). Spatial control of thermal ablation was ±1.3mm on MRI thermometry. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events included hematuria (43% grade [G] 1; 6.7% G2), urinary tract infections (33% G2), acute urinary retention (10% G1; 17% G2), and epididymitis (3.3% G3). There were no rectal injuries. Median pretreatment International Prostate Symptom Score 8 (IQR: 5-13) returned to 6 (IQR: 4-10) at 3 mo (mean change: -2; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4 to 1). Median pretreatment International Index of Erectile Function 13 (IQR: 6-28) recovered to 13 (IQR: 5-25) at 12 mo (mean change: -1; 95% CI, -5 to 3). Median PSA decreased 87% at 1 mo and was stable at 0.8 ng/ml (IQR: 0.6-1.1) to 12 mo. Positive biopsies showed 61% reduction in total cancer length, clinically significant disease in 9 of 29 patients (31%; 95% CI, 15-51), and any disease in 16 of 29 patients (55%; 95% CI, 36-74).  Conclusions:   MRI-TULSA was feasible, safe, and technically precise for whole-gland prostate ablation in patients with localized PCa. Phase 1 data are sufficiently compelling to study MRI-TULSA further in a larger prospective trial with reduced safety margins.  Patient summary:   We used magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound to heat and ablate the prostate in men with prostate cancer.

High demands for methyl and phospholipids in malignant cells suggest that choline metabolism may be disturbed in patients with cancer.  Objectives and methods:   This case-control study investigated differences in concentrations of choline metabolites between 80 elderly men (age ≥ 65 years) with prostate cancer (PCa) and 51 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Plasma/serum concentrations of free choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, folate, total homocysteine (tHcy), cystathionine, methylmalonic acid, S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and phospholipids were measured.  Results:   Men with BPH and those with PCa showed no significant differences in the concentrations of free choline (median = 9.7 vs. 10.0 μmol/L), folate (17.4 vs. 19.8 nmol/L), tHcy (16.0 vs. 16.2 μmol/L), SAH (18.8 vs. 18.2 nmol/L), and phosphatidylcholine (1634 vs. 1610 μmol/L). The concentrations of methylmalonic acid were lower in men with PCa (203 vs. 228 nmol/L) but the difference was not significant after adjusting for age. Sphingomyelin species (16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:0, 22:0, 22; 1, 23:0, 23:1, 24:0, 24:1, and 24:2) were significantly lower in men with PCa than in the controls (6-16% differences). Multiple regression analyses showed that the presence of PCa, statin use, choline, age, cystathionine, and methylmalonic acid were significant negative determinant of sphingomyelins, whereas phosphatidylcholine was a strong positive determinant.  Conclusions:   The current results support systemic alterations in phospholipids metabolism in PCa. We report on a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of sphingomyelin in elderly patients with PCa and in users of statins. The PCa-associated low sphingomyelin showed a synergy with the effect of statins. The presence of PCa was not associated with significant changes in plasma concentrations of choline or methyl metabolites.

A COMPARISON OF OPEN CLINICAL TRIALS TO THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS""","""Open clinical trial data offer many opportunities for the scientific community to independently verify published results, evaluate new hypotheses and conduct meta-analyses. These data provide a springboard for scientific advances in precision medicine but the question arises as to how representative clinical trials data are of cancer patients overall. Here we present the integrative analysis of data from several cancer clinical trials and compare these to patient-level data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Comparison of cancer type-specific survival rates reveals that these are overall lower in trial subjects. This effect, at least to some extent, can be explained by the more advanced stages of cancer of trial subjects. This analysis also reveals that for stage IV cancer, colorectal cancer patients have a better chance of survival than breast cancer patients. On the other hand, for all other stages, breast cancer patients have better survival than colorectal cancer patients. Comparison of survival in different stages of disease between the two datasets reveals that subjects with stage IV cancer from the trials dataset have a lower chance of survival than matching stage IV subjects from TCGA. One likely explanation for this observation is that stage IV trial subjects have lower survival rates since their cancer is less likely to respond to treatment. To conclude, we present here a newly available clinical trials dataset which allowed for the integration of patient-level data from many cancer clinical trials. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that cancer-related clinical trials are not representative of general cancer patient populations, mostly due to their focus on the more advanced stages of the disease. These and other limitations of clinical trials data should, perhaps, be taken into consideration in medical research and in the field of precision medicine.""","""['Nophar Geifman', 'Atul J Butte']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pac Symp Biocomput""","""['The project data sphere initiative: accelerating cancer research by sharing data.', 'PATIENT-SPECIFIC DATA FUSION FOR CANCER STRATIFICATION AND PERSONALISED TREATMENT.', 'A patient-level data meta-analysis of standard-of-care treatments from eight prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'MicroRNAs: key players in carcinogenesis and novel therapeutic targets.', 'Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.', 'Cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in cancer survivors of developed countries: a systematic review.', 'Use of a Targeted Exome Next-Generation Sequencing Panel Offers Therapeutic Opportunity and Clinical Benefit in a Subset of Patients With Advanced Cancers.', 'Real-life clinical data mining: generating hypotheses for evidence-based medicine.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature is inversely associated with T-cell infiltration in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).', 'Grappling with the Future Use of Big Data for Translational Medicine and Clinical Care.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate different types, intensities, and timing of physical activity relative to PCa survival.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective study was conducted in Alberta, Canada, in a cohort of 830 stage II-IV incident PCa cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2000 with follow-up to 2014 (up to 17 yr). Prediagnosis lifetime activity was self-reported at diagnosis. Postdiagnosis activity was self-reported up to three times during follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards models related physical activity to all-cause and PCa-specific deaths and to first recurrence/progression of PCa.  Results and limitations:   A total of 458 deaths, 170 PCa-specific deaths, and, after first follow-up, 239 first recurrences/progressions occurred. Postdiagnosis total activity (>119 vs ≤42 metabolic equivalent [MET]-hours/week per year) was associated with a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.79; p value for trend <0.01). Postdiagnosis recreational activity (>26 vs ≤4 MET-hours/week per year) was associated with a significantly lower PCa-specific mortality risk (HR: 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.90; p value for trend = 0.01). Sustained recreational activity before and after diagnosis (>18-20 vs <7-8 MET-hours/week per year) was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.88). Limitations included generalisability to healthier cases and an observational study design.

LCA Gluc II increased the expression of CYP24A1 in DU145 cancer cells especially in the presence of the endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D3. Furthermore, the methyl ester of LCA was identified as novel VDR antagonist. For the first time, we showed that calcitroic acid, the assumed inactive final metabolite of vitamin D, was able to activate VDR-mediated transcription to a higher magnitude than bile acid LCA. Due to a higher metabolic stability in comparison to vitamin D, a very low toxicity, and high concentration in bile and intestine, calcitroic acid is likely to be an important mediator of the protective vitamin D properties against colon cancer.""","""['Kelly A Teske', 'Jonathon W Bogart', 'Luis M Sanchez', 'Olivia B Yu', 'Joshua V Preston', 'James M Cook', 'Nicholas R Silvaggi', 'Daniel D Bikle', 'Leggy A Arnold']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Biological evaluation and synthesis of calcitroic acid.', 'Molecular and functional comparison of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the novel vitamin D receptor ligand, lithocholic acid, in activating transcription of cytochrome P450 3A4.', 'Lithocholic Acid Is a Vitamin D Receptor Ligand That Acts Preferentially in the Ileum.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of calcioic acid.', 'Crystal Structure of the Vitamin D Receptor Ligand-Binding Domain with Lithocholic Acids.', 'Biological evaluation and synthesis of calcitroic acid.', 'Epidermal Lipids: Key Mediators of Atopic Dermatitis Pathogenesis.', 'Parallel Chemistry Approach to Identify Novel Nuclear Receptor Ligands Based on the GW0742 Scaffold.', 'Calcitroic Acid-A Review.']"""

The objective of the TERRAIN study was to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide with bicalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   TERRAIN was a double-blind, randomised phase 2 study, that recruited asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with prostate cancer progression on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) from academic, community, and private health-care provision sites across North America and Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day or bicalutamide 50 mg/day, both taken orally, in addition to ADT, until disease progression. Patients were stratified by a permutated block method (block size of four), by whether bilateral orchiectomy or receipt of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy started before or after the diagnosis of metastases, and by study site. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, analysed in all randomised patients. Safety outcomes were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The open-label period of the trial is in progress, wherein patients still on treatment at the end of the double-blind treatment period were offered open-label enzalutamide at the discretion of the patient and study investigator. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01288911.  Findings:   Between March 22, 2011, and July 11, 2013, 375 patients were randomly assigned, 184 to enzalutamide and 191 to bicalutamide. 126 (68%) and 168 (88%) patients, respectively, discontinued their assigned treatment before study end, mainly due to progressive disease. Median follow-up time was 20·0 months (IQR 15·0-25·6) in the enzalutamide group and 16·7 months (10·2-21·9) in the bicalutamide group. Patients in the enzalutamide group had significantly improved median progression-free survival (15·7 months [95% CI 11·5-19·4]) compared with patients in the bicalutamide group (5·8 months [4·8-8·1]; hazard ratio 0·44 [95% CI 0·34-0·57]; p<0·0001). Of the most common adverse events, those occurring more frequently with enzalutamide than with bicalutamide were fatigue (51 [28%] of 183 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 38 [20%] of 189 in the bicalutamide group), back pain (35 [19%] vs 34 [18%]), and hot flush (27 [15%] vs 21 [11%]); those occurring more frequently with bicalutamide were nausea (26 [14%] vs 33 [17%]), constipation (23 [13%] vs 25 [13%]), and arthralgia (18 [10%] vs 30 [16%]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the enzalutamide or bicalutamide treatment groups, respectively, were hypertension (13 [7%] vs eight [4%]), hydronephrosis (three [2%] vs seven [4%]), back pain (five [3%] vs three [2%]), pathological fracture (five [3%] vs two [1%]), dyspnoea (four [2%] vs one [1%]), bone pain (one [1%] vs four [2%]), congestive cardiac failure (four [2%] vs two [1%]), myocardial infarction (five [3%] vs none), and anaemia (four [2%] vs none]). Serious adverse events were reported by 57 (31%) of 183 patients and 44 (23%) of 189 patients in the enzalutamide and bicalutamide groups, respectively. One of the nine deaths in the enzalutamide group was thought to be possibly related to treatment (due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome) compared with none of the three deaths in the bicalutamide group.  Interpretation:   The data from the TERRAIN trial support the use of enzalutamide rather than bicalutamide in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Between August 2011 and May 2013, 40 newly diagnosed intermediate and high-risk PCa patients underwent preoperative LN staging with 3 T MRI DWI using histopathology of ePLND as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI DWI were calculated. A subgroup analysis of proven LN-positive patients was made to investigate differences in PSA, Gleason score, number, and size of LN metastases, estimated risk of LN involvement, and if curative treatment was indicated, between the true-positive and the false-negative groups.  Results:   A total of 728 LN were harvested from six anatomical regions per patient (external, obturator, internal) with a mean number of 18 LNs per patient (range 11-40). Twenty patients had histologically proven LN-positive disease. MRI DWI was true positive in 11 patients, false negative in nine patients, false positive in two patients, and true negative in 18 patients, resulting in 90% specificity, 55% sensitivity, and 72.5% accuracy. The true-positive patients had significantly more involved LNs (mean 6.9 versus 2.7, p=0.017), with larger diameter (mean 12.3 versus 5.2 mm, p=0.048) and fewer were treated with curative intent (six versus nine, p=0.03), compared with the false-negative group.

We analyzed the survival outcomes in patients receiving SRP for radio-recurrent prostate cancer. The secondary outcome was effect of lymph node dissection on survival following SRP.  Materials and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry was used to identify patients that underwent radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2010. Search identified 2628 patients with prostate cancer that underwent surgery after radiation. Following exclusion, 364 patients remained. Endpoints included overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Effect of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) status and number of nodes retrieved were also studied. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and Cox-proportional hazard models were used, and P < .05 was considered to be significant.  Results:   OS was 77.5% at 10 years and 37.3% at 20 years; CSS was 88.6% at 10 years and 72.7% at 20 years. The hazard of mortality was higher in men who did not undergo PLND with a hazard ratio of 1.4 for OS (P = .2) and 2.7 for CSS (P = .01). No significant increase in OS or CC was seen with increasing number of lymph nodes retrieved. Some limitations are inherent to the SEER database and include the lack of hormone manipulation status and PSA data.  Conclusions:   Excellent long-term survival can be achieved with SRP. PLND improves CSS but increasing nodal yield does not significantly improve survival.

This whole cell impedance-based technology allows for the real-time measurement of morphological cellular changes. Both agonists dose-dependently decreased the impedance as a result of GnRH receptor activation with potencies of 9.3 ± 0.1 (pEC50 value, buserelin) and 7.8 ± 0.06 (pEC50 value, GnRH). Subsequently, GnRH receptor activation was completely abolished with a selective Gαq inhibitor, thereby confirming the Gαq-coupling of the GnRH receptor in pituitary αT3-1 cells. Additionally, we observed continued responses after agonist stimulation of αT3-1 cells indicating long-lasting cellular effects. Wash-out experiments demonstrated that the long-lasting effects induced by GnRH were most likely caused by rebinding since over 70% of the original response was abolished after wash-out. In contrast, a long receptor residence time was responsible for the prolonged effects caused by buserelin, with over 70% of the original response remaining after wash-out. In summary, we validated that impedance-based label-free technology is suited for studying receptor-mediated activation in cell lines endogenously expressing the target of interest.

We provide arguments for the use of Python as a robust scripting language for incorporation into larger software solutions, outline the structure of pyOsiriX and how it may be used to extend the functionality of OsiriX, and we provide three case studies that exemplify its utility. For our first case study we use pyOsiriX to provide a tool for smooth histogram display of voxel values within a user-defined region of interest (ROI) in OsiriX. We used a kernel density estimation (KDE) method available in Python using the scikit-learn library, where the total number of lines of Python code required to generate this tool was 22. Our second example presents a scheme for segmentation of the skeleton from CT datasets. We have demonstrated that good segmentation can be achieved for two example CT studies by using a combination of Python libraries including scikit-learn, scikit-image, SimpleITK and matplotlib. Furthermore, this segmentation method was incorporated into an automatic analysis of quantitative PET-CT in a patient with bone metastases from primary prostate cancer. This enabled repeatable statistical evaluation of PET uptake values for each lesion, before and after treatment, providing estaimes maximum and median standardised uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmed respectively). Following treatment we observed a reduction in lesion volume, SUVmax and SUVmed for all lesions, in agreement with a reduction in concurrent measures of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).""","""['Matthew D Blackledge', 'David J Collins', 'Dow-Mu Koh', 'Martin O Leach']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PyRaDiSe: A Python package for DICOM-RT-based auto-segmentation pipeline construction and DICOM-RT data conversion.', 'qPSMA: Semiautomatic Software for Whole-Body Tumor Burden Assessment in Prostate Cancer Using 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT.', 'OsiriX: an open-source software for navigating in multidimensional DICOM images.', 'OsiriX software as a preoperative planning tool in cranial neurosurgery: A step-by-step guide for neurosurgical residents.', 'Quantitative analysis of diffusion weighted imaging in rectal cancer during radiotherapy using a magnetic resonance imaging integrated linear accelerator.', 'Early Response to Chemotherapy in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Evaluated Using Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Initial Observations.', 'CT-Based Pelvic T1-Weighted MR Image Synthesis Using UNet, UNet++ and Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (Cycle-GAN).', 'Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in lymphoma-comparison of global apparent diffusion coefficient histogram parameters for differentiation of diseased nodes of lymphoma patients from normal lymph nodes of healthy individuals.', 'Markers of human endometrial hypoxia can be detected in vivo and ex vivo during physiological menstruation.']"""

The Romanian unscreened population represents a good sample to study common genetic risk variants. However, a comprehensive analysis has not been conducted yet. Here, we report our replication efforts in a Romanian population of 979 cases and 1027 controls, for potential association of 34 literature-reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with prostate cancer. We also examined whether any SNP was differentially associated with tumour grade or stage at diagnosis, with disease aggressiveness, and with the levels of PSA (prostate specific antigen). In the allelic analysis, we replicated the previously reported risk for 19 loci on 4q24, 6q25.3, 7p15.2, 8q24.21, 10q11.23, 10q26.13, 11p15.5, 11q13.2, 11q13.3. Statistically significant associations were replicated for other six SNPs only with a particular disease phenotype: low-grade tumour and low PSA levels (rs1512268), high PSA levels (rs401681 and rs11649743), less aggressive cancers (rs1465618, rs721048, rs17021918). The strongest association of our tested SNP's with PSA in controls was for rs2735839, with 29% increase for each copy of the major allele G, consistent with previous results. Our results suggest that rs4962416, previously associated only with prostate cancer, is also associated with PSA levels, with 12% increase for each copy of the minor allele C. The study enabled the replication of the effect for the majority of previously reported genetic variants in a set of clinically relevant prostate cancers. This is the first replication study on these loci, known to associate with prostate cancer, in a Romanian population.""","""['Viorel Jinga', 'Irma Eva Csiki', 'Andrei Manolescu', 'Paul Iordache', 'Ioan Nicolae Mates', 'Daniel Radavoi', 'Stefan Rascu', 'Daniel Badescu', 'Paula Badea', 'Dana Mates']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Profile of common prostate cancer risk variants in an unscreened Romanian population.', 'Association study between common variations in some candidate genes and prostate adenocarcinoma predisposition through multi-stage approach in Iranian population.', 'The prostate cancer susceptibility variant rs2735839 near KLK3 gene is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and can stratify gleason score 7 patients.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Genetic variant located on chromosome 17p12 contributes to prostate cancer onset and biochemical recurrence.', 'Cumulative evidence of relationships between multiple variants in 8q24 region and cancer incidence.', 'Cumulative Evidence for Relationships Between 8q24 Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'Profile of common prostate cancer risk variants in an unscreened Romanian population.']"""

Expression of four stem cell transcription factor (TF) genes, LIN28A, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, were analyzed in the LuCaP lines. These genes, when force expressed in differentiated cells, can reprogram the recipients into stem-like induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Most LuCaP lines expressed POU5F1, while LuCaP 145.1, representative of small cell carcinoma, expressed all four. Through transcriptome database query, many small cell carcinoma genes were also found in stem cells. To test the hypothesis that prostate cancer progression from ""differentiated"" adenocarcinoma to ""undifferentiated"" small cell carcinoma could involve re-expression of stem cell genes, the four TF genes were transduced via lentiviral vectors into five adenocarcinoma LuCaP lines-70CR, 73CR, 86.2, 92, 105CR-as done in iPS cell reprogramming. The resultant cells from these five transductions displayed a morphology of small size and dark appearing unlike the parentals. Transcriptome analysis of LuCaP 70CR* (""*"" to denote transfected progeny) revealed a unique gene expression close to that of LuCaP 145.1. In a prostate principal components analysis space based on cell-type transcriptomes, the different LuCaP transcriptome datapoints were aligned to suggest a possible ordered sequence of expression changes from the differentiated luminal-like adenocarcinoma cell types to the less differentiated, more stem-like small cell carcinoma types, and LuCaP 70CR*. Prostate cancer progression can thus be molecularly characterized by loss of differentiation with re-expression of stem cell genes. J. Cell.

Methods:   We conducted a detailed pathologic analysis of 469 RP from men with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer who had Gleason score of 3 + 3 = 6 (grade group 1) at RP. We then compared the ability of PSA, PSA density (PSAD), PSA mass (PSAM-absolute amount of PSA in patient's circulation), and PSAM density (PSAM divided by prostate weight without seminal vesicles) to predict TTV at RP. PSAM was calculated by multiplying plasma volume (estimated body surface [weight, kg(0.425) × height, m(0.72) × 0.007184] × 1.67) by PSA. Performance of the above measures in different BMI categories was assessed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the means and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to assess the correlations.  Results:   The 469 men were normal weight (n = 129), overweight (n = 253), and obese (n = 87). Mean age of the patients' was 57.4 years and PSA of 4.53 ng/ml. Increase of prostate weight with body mass index (BMI) was reflected in PSAM (both P <.001) but not in other measures. BMI did not correlate with TTV and PSA. Among PSA, PSAD, PSAM, and PSAMD, PSAMD had the highest correlation with TTV (r = 0.336; P <.001). Prostate weight had stronger (negative) association with PSAMD (r = -0.394; <.001) than TTV.  Conclusion:   PSAMD is the biochemical measure with the best correlation with TTV at RP. Unlike other measures, it is not affected by BMI-related hemodilution.

Results:   Of 101 urology residents throughout the Netherlands, 87 attended the training (response rate 100%). Median age was 32 years (range 28-38); 55.2% were woman. Regardless of the residency level, most trainees had never received education about sexual dysfunction (58.6%), reported a limited level of knowledge (48.3%), and indicated an evident need for training (69.4%).

Calcein and dextran (150kDa) were delivered into >50% of cells, whereas larger dextrans (≤2000kDa) were taken up by ~10% of cells. Under all conditions studied, cell viability loss was minimal. Uptake also increased with increasing laser power, increasing CB nanoparticle concentration, increasing CB nanoparticle size and decreasing laser wavelength. CB nanoparticles enabled uptake better than gold nanoparticles or multi-walled carbon nanotubes under the conditions studied. Proof-of-principle experiments showed intracellular uptake by cells in vivo. We conclude that intracellular uptake of molecules using laser-activated CB nanoparticles provides a promising approach to deliver molecules into cells.

However, some primary care physicians (PCPs) continue to have high rates of PSA, with large variation in testing. We assessed the tests, treatments, and payments for prostate cancer care in men aged 75 or older who have PCPs with high or low PSA testing rates.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study using the 2010 Medicare beneficiaries aged 75 or older in Texas, United States who had no prostate cancer in 2007-2009 and had an identifiable PCP. We first identified high vs. low PSA testing PCPs, and then grouped older men in the two PCP groups. We determined health care visits to any provider and to urologists in office and outpatient settings. We estimated the direct medical payments for prostate cancer care for diagnostics, treatments and visits to providers in 2010-2011 using the generalized gamma model with log link function.  Results:   In multilevel, multivariable analyses, 25.4% (n = 550) of PCPs had PSA testing rates in men aged 75 or older that were significantly higher than the mean rate of all 2,169 Texas PCPs; 29.4% (n = 638) had rates that were significantly lower. In all, 22,853 vs. 23,929 older men were cared for by PCPs with high vs. low testing rates. Older men cared for by high PSA rate PCPs were more likely to receive a PSA test (OR 3.64, 95% CI 3.48-3.80), a biopsy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31), an ultrasound (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.32) or any radiation treatment (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.66) than men cared for by low PSA rate PCPs. Men with high PSA rate PCPs were 1.21 (95% CI 1.05-1.39) times more likely to have such outpatient visits. The average annual adjusted Medicare payments for prostate cancer care was $25.60 higher for patients cared for by PCPs with high PSA test rates.

However, mCRPC patients invariably develop resistance to these agents. Here, a series of clonal cell lines were developed from enzalutamide-resistant prostate tumor xenografts to study the molecular mechanism of resistance and test their oncogenic potential under various treatment conditions. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling was maintained in these cell lines, which acquired potential resistance mechanisms, including expression of AR-variant 7 (AR-v7) and glucocorticoid receptor. BET bromodomain inhibitors were shown previously to attenuate AR signaling in mCRPC; here, we demonstrate the efficacy of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer models. AR antagonists, enzalutamide, and ARN509 exhibit enhanced prostate tumor growth inhibition when combined with BET inhibitors, JQ1 and OTX015, respectively. Taken together, these data provide a compelling preclinical rationale to combine BET inhibitors with AR antagonists to subvert resistance mechanisms.

Recently, several ghrelin gene splice variants have been described. Here, we attempted to identify conserved alternative splicing of the ghrelin gene by cross-species sequence comparisons. We identified a novel human exon 2-deleted variant and provide preliminary evidence that this splice variant and in1-ghrelin encode a C-terminally truncated form of the ghrelin peptide, termed minighrelin. These variants are expressed in humans and mice, demonstrating conservation of alternative splicing spanning 90 million years. Minighrelin appears to have similar actions to full-length ghrelin, as treatment with exogenous minighrelin peptide stimulates appetite and feeding in mice. Forced expression of the exon 2-deleted preproghrelin variant mirrors the effect of the canonical preproghrelin, stimulating cell proliferation and migration in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. This is the first study to characterise an exon 2-deleted preproghrelin variant and to demonstrate sequence conservation of ghrelin gene-derived splice variants that encode a truncated ghrelin peptide.

Unfortunately, many clinical studies have shown that cancer cells acquire TRAIL resistance and finally avoid TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, defining the mechanisms that permit TRAIL to activate apoptosis is critical for the development of strategies that maximize the potential effectiveness of TRAIL in clinical applications. This study aims at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TRAIL-induced apoptosis and unraveling signaling pathways that could revert sensitivity to apoptosis stimuli. Our current study demonstrates for the first time that Sigma 1 Receptor (Sig1R), a ligand-regulated protein chaperone, contributes to TRAIL induction of apoptosis. We show that Sig1R agonist (+)-SKF10047 action or increasing Sig1R expression, significantly reduced apoptosis by TRAIL in prostate cell lines, indicating the importance of Sig1R and signifying that higher levels of Sig1R in prostate cancer cells make them more resistant to TRAIL treatment. Here we show that Sig1R is critically involved in TRAIL-induced caspase activation. Furthermore, we show that Sig1R protein is degraded upon TRAIL treatment. Knockdown of Sig1R, by siRNA transfection increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TRAIL. These results indicate that Sig1R could represent a promising molecule to sensitize human breast cancers to TRAIL. Collectively, these studies define Sig1R as a key mediator of TRAIL induction of cancer-specific killing.""","""['Dibash Das', 'Leah Persaud', 'Jordan Dejoie', 'Mireille Happy', 'Oliver Brannigan', 'Dayenny De Jesus', 'Moira Sauane']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Apoptosis induction in prostate cancer cells and xenografts by combined treatment with Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and CPT-11.', 'Tunicamycin enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Sensitivity of prostate cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis increases with tumor progression: DR5 and caspase 8 are key players.', 'Traditional Chinese medicines and their active ingredients sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Sigma-1 receptor and seizures.', 'Defining the ligand-dependent proximatome of the sigma 1 receptor.', 'The lncRNA CASC2 Modulates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Sensitivity and Resistance to TRAIL Through Apoptotic and Non-Apoptotic Signaling.', 'Sigma 1 Receptor Contributes to Astrocyte-Mediated Retinal Ganglion Cell Protection.', 'Pharmacophore and docking-based sequential virtual screening for the identification of novel Sigma 1 receptor ligands.', 'Bridging from Brain to Tumor Imaging: (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)-18FFluspidine for Investigation of Sigma-1 Receptors in Tumor-Bearing Mice.']"""

Methods:   After LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with different concentration of quercetin (0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 μmol/L) or 2-ME (0, 0.312 5, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 μmol/L) for 48 h, the inhibitory rates of cell growth were tested using trypan blue staining method respectively. Then the concentration-effect curves were drawn and IC(50) values were calculated. According to the fitted dose-effect curves and IC(50) values, appropriate concentrations of quercetin and 2-ME were selected to compose 16 different combos. Then cells were treated with different combos of Que and 2-ME for 48 h, and then the growth inhibitory rates of cell growth were detected.

While high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, given as a boost is effective in delivering a high BED, many patients are not candidates for the procedure or wish to avoid an invasive procedure. We evaluated the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a boost, with dosimetry modeled after HDR-boost.  Material and methods:   Fifty patients were treated with two fractions of SBRT (9.5-10.5 Gy/fraction) after 45 Gy external-beam radiotherapy, with 48 eligible for analysis at a median follow-up of 42.7 months.  Results:   The Kaplan-Meier estimates of biochemical control post-radiation therapy (95 % Confidence Interval) at 3, 4 and 5 years were 95 % (81-99 %), 90 % (72-97 %) and 90 % (72-97 %), respectively (not counting 2 patients with a PSA bounce as failures). RFS (defined as disease recurrence or death) estimates at 3, 4 and 5 years were 92 % (77-97 %), 88 % (69-95 %) and 83 % (62-93 %) if patients with PSA bounces are not counted as failures, and were 90 % (75-96 %), 85 % (67-94 %) and 75 % (53-88 %) if they were. The median time to PSA nadir was 26.2 months (range 5.8-82.9 months), with a median PSA nadir of 0.05 ng/mL (range <0.01-1.99 ng/mL). 2 patients had a ""benign PSA bounce"", and 4 patients recurred with radiographic evidence of recurrence beyond the RT fields.

We present a protocol using a novel high resolution (29 MHz) transrectal prostate micro-ultrasound system. This protocol includes a scoring system to assess the risk of prostatic carcinoma and enable real-time targeted biopsies.  Materials and methods:   The ExactVu™ system is currently being used in a multisite, 2,000-patient, randomized clinical trial. Cine loops of 400 biopsies from this trial were used to create the PRI-MUS™ (prostate risk identification using micro-ultrasound) protocol and risk scale. Validation was performed in an independent, pathology blinded set of 100 cines. Three of the 5 investigators performing this validation were familiar with micro-ultrasound but naïve to the PRI-MUS protocol and they received only 1 hour of training.  Results:   Each increase in risk score demonstrated a 10.1% increase (95% CI 9.3-10.8) in the probability of clinically significant cancer. The risk score also increased with Gleason sum and cancer length with a slope of 0.15 (95% CI 0.09-0.21) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.73), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 37%, respectively, and the mean ± SD ROC AUC was 60% ± 2%. The protocol was more accurate for detecting high grade disease (Gleason sum greater than 7) with a peak AUC of 74% (mean 66%).  Conclusions:   The new resolution of the micro-ultrasound platform paired with the PRI-MUS protocol shows promise for real-time visualization of suspicious lesions and targeting of biopsies. The improved performance of the protocol in more significant disease is consistent with the focus of the field on decreasing insignificant diagnoses and detecting high risk disease early.""","""['Sangeet Ghai', 'Gregg Eure', 'Vincent Fradet', 'Matthew E Hyndman', 'Theresa McGrath', 'Brian Wodlinger', 'Christian P Pavlovich']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Reply by Authors.', 'Prostate Mapping for Cancer Diagnosis: The Madrid Protocol.

The adenosine A2B receptor (A2BAR) is dynamically upregulated under pathologic conditions associated with a hypoxic microenvironment, including solid tumors. This, in turn, may amplify ligand-independent A2BAR signal transduction. The contribution of A2BAR constitutive activity to disease progression is currently unknown yet of fundamental importance, as the preferred therapeutic modality for drugs designed to reduce A2BAR constitutive activity would be inverse agonism as opposed to neutral antagonism. The current study investigated A2BAR constitutive activity in a heterologous expression system and a native 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell line exposed to hypoxic conditions (2% O2). The A2BAR inverse agonists, ZM241385 [4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol] or PSB-603 (8-(4-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazide-1-sulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propylxanthine), mediated a concentration-dependent decrease in baseline cAMP levels in both cellular systems. Proliferation of multiple prostate cancer cell lines was also attenuated in the presence of PSB-603. Importantly, both the decrease in baseline cAMP accumulation and the reduction of proliferation were not influenced by the addition of adenosine deaminase, demonstrating that these effects are not dependent on stimulation of A2BARs by the endogenous agonist adenosine. Our study is the first to reveal that wild-type human A2BARs have high constitutive activity in both model and native cells. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that this ligand-independent A2BAR constitutive activity is sufficient to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. More broadly, A2BAR constitutive activity may have wider, currently unappreciated implications in pathologic conditions associated with a hypoxic microenvironment.""","""['Elizabeth A Vecchio', 'Christina Y R Tan', 'Karen J Gregory', 'Arthur Christopoulos', 'Paul J White', 'Lauren T May']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Capadenoson, a clinically trialed partial adenosine A1 receptor agonist, can stimulate adenosine A2B receptor biased agonism.', 'The hybrid molecule, VCP746, is a potent adenosine A2B receptor agonist that stimulates anti-fibrotic signalling.', 'Characterisation of endogenous A2A and A2B receptor-mediated cyclic AMP responses in HEK 293 cells using the GloSensor™ biosensor: Evidence for an allosteric mechanism of action for the A2B-selective antagonist PSB 603.', 'Adenosine receptors and diabetes: Focus on the A(2B) adenosine receptor subtype.', 'A2B Adenosine Receptor and Cancer.', 'The adenosinergic machinery in cancer: In-tandem insights from basic mechanisms to therapy.', 'Adenosine, Schizophrenia and Cancer: Does the Purinergic System Offer a Pathway to Treatment?', 'Fighting in a wasteland: deleterious metabolites and antitumor immunity.', 'Current Adenosinergic Therapies: What Do Cancer Cells Stand to Gain and Lose?', 'Expression and Gene Regulation Network of Adenosine Receptor A2B in Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker.']"""

SRS was evaluated in a wide range of samples including glycoproteins, cell lysate, murine tissues, and human urine. SRS was also coupled to a quantitative strategy to investigate the differences between DU145 prostate cancer cells and its DIAPH3-silenced counterpart.

In this pilot study we identified distinct proteomic and N-glycomic alterations between them. A metastasis-associated tyrosine kinase receptor ephrin-type-A receptor (EPHA2) was highly up-regulated in DIAPH3-silenced cells, indicating a possible connection between EPHA2 and DIAPH3.

Early studies suggested that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was expressed in stromal cells in normal prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), but the detailed functions of stromal ERα in the PCa remain to be further elucidated.  Methods:   Migration and invasion assays demonstrated the presence of high levels of ERα in CAF cells (CAF.ERα(+)) suppressed PCa invasion via influencing the infiltration of tumor associated macrophages. ERα decreased CAF CCL5 secretion via suppressing the CCL5 promoter activity was examined by luciferase assay. ERα decreased CCL5 and IL-6 expression in conditioned media that was collected from CAF cell only or CAF cell co-cultured with macrophages as measured by ELISA assay.  Results:   Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated CAF.ERα(+) led to a reduced macrophage migration toward PCa via inhibiting CAF cells secreted chemokine CCL5. This CAF.ERα(+) suppressed macrophage infiltration affected the neighboring PCa cells invasion and the reduced invasiveness of PCa cells are at least partly due to reduced IL6 expression in the macrophages and CAF.

Firstly, we demonstrated that MSCs could affect the transformation of androgen-dependent human PCa cells into androgen-independent manner in vivo and in vitro. Then we found a substantial expression of TGF-β in MSCs. TGF-β blockade could significantly inhibit the promotive function of MSCs in PCa cells. Besides that, we also demonstrated androgen might inhibit the expression of TGF-β in MSCs. Furthermore, we found that either overexpression of SSEA-4 or the number of SSEA-4 positive MSCs in PCa tissues was associated with a shorter cancer-free survival interval (CFSI) and a worse overall survival (OS).

Background:   Prostate cancer has become more prevalent since the introduction of PSA screening, however, many men are diagnosed with low-risk disease that may not require treatment. Active surveillance is a treatment strategy used to avoid treatment and related adverse effects when immediate treatment is not necessary. A universal definition is lacking.  Design:   Concept analysis.  Data sources:   The CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases were searched for literature published between 1980 and 2014 using the term active surveillance.  Methods:   The method of Walker and Avant (2010) was used to analyse the concept of active surveillance, specifically within the context of prostate cancer.  Results:   Key attributes of active surveillance emerging from the analysis include: regular and purposeful monitoring, early detection of disease progression and planned curative intervention if necessary. Multiple terms are used in the literature to refer to the concept of active surveillance. Active surveillance can cause uncertainty, and prompt men to make lifestyle changes and seek more information on prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Active surveillance is not well understood, and ambiguity remains around the concept. Active surveillance and watchful waiting are used interchangeably in the literature and in clinical practice, but in fact do not refer to the same strategy.

This article aims to determine the hospital incidence, trend and municipal distribution of PC in Health Area of León (HAL).  Methods:   We included new cases of prostate cancer (ICD-9: 185, ICD-10: C61) enrolled in the Hospital Tumor Registry of the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León, between 1996 to 2010 with residence in HAL. We calculated crude triennial hospital incidences and adjusted at global and European population. As denominator we used the INE population data disaggregated by five-year age groups of residents in municipalities of the HAL. To analyze the spatial distribution, we estimated municipal relative risks (RR) smoothed by fitting the Besag, York and Mollié model and the posterior probability (PP) of RR >1 using Bayesian methods.  Results:   3,366 cases were included. Standardized rates at European population amounted of 30.3 (1996-98) to 119.0 (2008-2010) new cases per 100,000 men. The number of organ-confined cases were increased from 281 (1999-2001) to 999 (2008-2010). PSA determinations amounted from 30,985 (1999-2001) to 117 396 (2008-2010).

Here we show that androgens (5α-dihydrotestosterone and R1881) suppress c-Fos protein and mRNA expression induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or EGF in human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Such suppression transpires through a transcriptional mechanism, predominantly at the proximal serum response element of the c-fos promoter. We show that androgen signaling suppresses TPA-induced c-Fos expression through repressing a PKC/MEK/ERK/ELK-1 signaling pathway. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that p38(MAPK), PI3K, and PKCδ are involved in the androgenic regulation of c-Fos through controlling MEK/ERK. Stable silencing of c-Fos and PKCδ with shRNAs suggests that R1881 promotes cell death induced by low-dose TPA through a mechanism that is dependent on both PKCδ and loss of c-Fos expression. Reciprocally, loss of either PKCδ or c-Fos activates p38(MAPK) while suppressing the activation of ERK1/2. We also provide the first demonstration that R1881 permits cell death induced by low-dose TPA in the LNCaP androgen-dependent PCa cell line and that TPA-induced cell death is independent of exogenous androgen in the castration-resistant variants of LNCaP, C4-2 and C4-2B. Acquisition of androgen-independent killing by TPA correlates with activation of p38(MAPK), suppression of ERK1/2, and loss of c-Fos.

Due to limited availability of laboratory devices in an outpatient setting, compact and easy-to-handle point-of-care (POC) systems are desirable. Recently, a chip for PSA measurement on the concile® Ω100 POC reader platform was introduced. To investigate the clinical applicability, we evaluated the system in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing PSA measurement in our outpatient clinic.  Methods:   Between 07/2014 and 01/2015, PSA was analyzed in a total of 198 patients by the POC reader system and in parallel by an Immulite 2000® and Centaur® standard laboratory system, respectively. By standard (Immulite®) measurement, 67 (34,2 %) had PSA > 4 ng/ml and 131 (65,8 %) had PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml. Results were correlated by linear regression analyses for all patients and within PSA subgroups. For patients with available prostate histology after PSA measurement (n = 68), receiver-operating characteristic curves were created and area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of PC at best cut-off value were calculated.  Results:   The coefficients of determination (r(2)) for the POC device compared to laboratory testing were 0.72 (Immulite®) and 0.63 (Centaur®), respectively (both p < 0.0001). In the PSA range of ≤4 ng/ml, the observed correlations were 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. For the POC test system, AUC for detection of PC was calculated with 0.745 while the standard laboratory tests showed 0.778 (Immulite®) and 0.771 (Centaur®). At best cut-off of 3.64 ng/ml, PSA analysis by the POC system showed a sensitivity of 85.7 % and a specificity of 66.7 %.  Conclusions:   The POC system obtained good concordance to elaborate laboratory measurement. In a screening scenario, the system provides quick and reliable PSA measurement, especially in the PSA range up to 4 ng/ml.""","""['Steffen Rausch', 'Joerg Hennenlotter', 'Josef Wiesenreiter', 'Andrea Hohneder', 'Julian Heinkele', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Tilman Todenhöfer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Determination of Free-PSA (fPSA) and fPSA/PSA-Ratio Using A Point-of-Care Device.', 'Comparison Between the Four-kallikrein Panel and Prostate Health Index for Predicting Prostate Cancer.', 'Complexed prostate specific antigen density is better than the other PSA derivatives for detection of prostate cancer in men with total PSA between 2.5 and 20 ng/ml: results of a prospective multicenter study.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

By high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiling of three pairs of primary ESCCs and their corresponding non-tumorous tissues, we identified that prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, is significantly downregulated in ESCC. Here, we reported decreased expression of PSCA in 188/218 (86.2%) of primary ESCC cases and was negatively regulated by its transcription factor sex-determining region Y-box5 that was significantly associated with the poor differentiation (P = 0.003), increased lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001), advanced stage (P = 0.007), and disease-specific survival (P < 0.0001), but not associated with the recently reported transcrible rs2294008 (C > T) polymorphism in ESCC. Functional studies showed that PSCA could arrest cell cycle progression and promote cell differentiation independent of the start codon polymorphism. Further mechanistic studies revealed that retinoblastoma 1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1), a key signaling node to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation, interacted specifically with PSCA in ESCC cells. Binding of PSCA and RB1CC1 in cytoplasm resulted in stabilization and translocation of RB1CC1 into nucleus, thereby activating key factors involved in cell cycle arrest and differentiation.

Methods:   From October 1999 to March 2012 we treated 1080 patients affected by prostate cancer, using External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT). The mean age was 69.2 years. Most of the patients (69%) were staged as cT2, Gleason Score (GS)<7; the mean iPSA 18 ng/mL; the rate of clinical positive nodes was 1%. Our intention to treat was the following: for low risk patients 72 Gy; for intermediate risk patients 75.6 Gy and for high-very high risk patients 79.2 Gy in 1.8 Gy/day fractions. From 2008 we changed the fractionation scheme and the doses were the following: for low risk patients 74 Gy and for intermediate and high-very high risk patients 78 Gy in 2.0 Gy/day fractions. Whole pelvis irradiation was performed in high-very high risk patients with 43.2-50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy per day. The mean follow-up was 81 months.  Results:   For the whole population at 5 and 10 years, the prostate cancer specific overall survival (CSOS) was 96.7% and 92.2% respectively; the clinical disease free survival (CDFS) 88% and 77%; the biochemical disease free survival (BDFS) 75% and 58.5%. The 5 and 10 years CSOS was 98% and 96% respectively for low risk, 96% and 92% for intermediate risk and 89% and 82% for high-very high risk patients. In intermediate and high-very high risk groups at 5 and 10 years the CSOS was 95.2% and 89.2% respectively, the CDFS 84.5% and 70% and the BDFS 70% and 51% respectively. In high-very high risk patients at 5 and 10 years the CSOS were respectively 89% and 82% the CDFS was 78% and 61% and BDFS was 61% and 34%. In whole patient population the BDFS was related with the dose level (P=0.006) as well as the CDFS (P=0.003) with a cut off of 75.6 Gy. In the subgroup of intermediate plus high-very high risk patients the BDFS and the CDFS were dose-related with a cut off of 75.6 Gy (P=0.007 and P=0.0018 respectively). Finally, in the subgroup of high-very high risk patients we found that the CSOS, the BDFS and the CDFS were related to the dose level with a cut-off of 77.7 Gy (P=0.017; P=0.006 and P=0.038, respectively). Overall gastrointestinal (GI) acute and late G2 toxicities were respectively 5 % and 3.8%; GI acute and late >G3 toxicities were respectively 0.5% and 0.9%; acute and late >G2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities were respectively 10.5% and 2.6%; finally GU acute and late >G3 toxicities were respectively 0.6% and 0.5%.  Conclusions:   The dose escalation is not relevant for the outcome in low risk patients that can benefit from relatively moderate doses (72-74 Gy). For intermediate and high-very high risk patients the dose becomes significant to levels above 75.6 Gy; particularly in high-very high risk doses >77.7 Gy correlate with an improved outcome. Patients receiving dose >77.7 Gy presented a higher rate of overall GI and GU toxicity, but the number of grade >2 remains low. Our results, consolidated by a long follow-up, corroborate the literature data, confirming that 3D-CRT can allow a safe dose escalation without significantly increasing the severe toxicity.""","""['Elisabetta Garibaldi', 'Domenico Gabriele', 'Angelo Maggio', 'Elena Delmastro', 'Monica Garibaldi', 'Sara Bresciani', 'Cinzia Ortega', 'Michele Stasi', 'Pietro Gabriele']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Panminerva Med""","""['Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Radiation dose escalation for localized prostate cancer: intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus permanent transperineal brachytherapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'What is the ideal radiotherapy dose to treat prostate cancer?

In this study, we identify C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN) molecule as a downstream target of ΔNp63α, the predominant p63 isoform expressed in epithelium. CTEN belongs to the tensin family and is mainly localized to focal adhesions, which mediate many biological events such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and gene expression. Our study demonstrate that ΔNp63 and CTEN are both highly expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells and are down-regulated in prostate cancer. In addition, reduced expression of CTEN and ΔNp63 is correlated with prostate cancer progression from primary tumors to metastatic lesions. Silencing of ΔNp63 leads to decreased mRNA and protein levels of CTEN. ΔNp63α induces transcriptional activity of the CTEN promoter and a 140-bp fragment upstream of the transcription initiation site is the minimal promoter region required for activation. A putative binding site for p63 is located between -61 and -36 within the CTEN promoter and mutations of the critical nucleotides in this region abolish ΔNp63α-induced promoter activity. The direct interaction of ΔNp63α with the CTEN promoter was demonstrated using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Moreover, impaired cell adhesion caused by ΔNp63α depletion is rescued by over-expression of CTEN, suggesting that CTEN is a downstream effector of ΔNp63α-mediated cell adhesion. In summary, our findings demonstrate that ΔNp63α functions as a trans-activation factor of CTEN promoter and regulates cell adhesion through modulating CTEN.

It is caused by persistent compression to the nerves. Our aim was to investigate the levels of compression to the nerves by measuring the contact pressure of the lower extremities in men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Materials and methods:   A total of 138 patients undergoing RARP were enrolled prospectively. The contact pressure of the lower extremities was measured using a portable contact pressure measurement device (Cello®, Cape Co., Kanagawa, Japan) in lithotomy position (L position) and L-T position preoperatively, and in L position postoperatively. Patient positioning was readjusted when the preoperative contact pressure was over 32 mm Hg. The contact pressure was compared between pre- and postoperative values.  Results:   A total of 33 patients (23.9%) needed readjustment of positioning due to high contact pressure. No one developed LEN.

Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the anterograde (outward) movement of lysosomes to the cell surface in response to certain tumor microenvironment stimulus, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or acidic extracellular pH (pHe), increases cathepsin B secretion and tumor cell invasion. Anterograde lysosome trafficking depends on sodium-proton exchanger activity and can be reversed by blocking these ion pumps with Troglitazone or EIPA. Since these drugs cannot be advanced into the clinic due to toxicity, we have designed a high-content assay to discover drugs that block peripheral lysosome trafficking with the goal of identifying novel drugs that inhibit tumor cell invasion. An automated high-content imaging system (Cellomics) was used to measure the position of lysosomes relative to the nucleus. Among a total of 2210 repurposed and natural product drugs screened, 18 ""hits"" were identified. One of the compounds identified as an anterograde lysosome trafficking inhibitor was niclosamide, a marketed human anti-helminthic drug. Further studies revealed that niclosamide blocked acidic pHe, HGF, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced anterograde lysosome redistribution, protease secretion, motility, and invasion of DU145 castrate resistant prostate cancer cells at clinically relevant concentrations. In an effort to identify the mechanism by which niclosamide prevented anterograde lysosome movement, we found that this drug exhibited no significant effect on the level of ATP, microtubules or actin filaments, and had minimal effect on the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Niclosamide collapsed intralysosomal pH without disruption of the lysosome membrane, while bafilomycin, an agent that impairs lysosome acidification, was also found to induce JLA in our model. Taken together, these data suggest that niclosamide promotes juxtanuclear lysosome aggregation (JLA) via modulation of pathways involved in lysosome acidification. In conclusion, we have designed a validated reproducible high-content assay to screen for drugs that inhibit lysosome trafficking and reduce tumor invasion and we summarize the action of one of these drugs.""","""['Magdalena L Circu', 'Samantha S Dykes', 'Jennifer Carroll', 'Kinsey Kelly', 'Floyd Galiano', 'Adam Greer', 'James Cardelli', 'Hazem El-Osta']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: A Novel High Content Imaging-Based Screen Identifies the Anti-Helminthic Niclosamide as an Inhibitor of Lysosome Anterograde Trafficking and Prostate Cancer Cell Invasion.', 'HGF-induced invasion by prostate tumor cells requires anterograde lysosome trafficking and activity of Na+-H+ exchangers.', 'Lysosome trafficking is necessary for EGF-driven invasion and is regulated by p38 MAPK and Na+/H+ exchangers.', 'Na+/H+ exchangers and RhoA regulate acidic extracellular pH-induced lysosome trafficking in prostate cancer cells.', 'Niclosamide, an old antihelminthic agent, demonstrates antitumor activity by blocking multiple signaling pathways of cancer stem cells.', 'Mechanisms and functions of lysosome positioning.', 'Measurement of Lysosome Positioning by Shell Analysis and Line Scan.', 'Bromodomains in Human-Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders: A Model of Ferroptosis-Induced Neurodegeneration.', 'Crosstalk between dihydroceramides produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis and host lysosomal cathepsin B in the promotion of osteoclastogenesis.', 'Overcoming Drug Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer by Drug Repurposing.', 'Identification of lysosome-targeting drugs with anti-inflammatory activity as potential invasion inhibitors of treatment resistant HER2 positive cancers.']"""

In this study we evaluated the impact of a biological bladder neck sling on the return of urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   This study compared early continence in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with a sling and without a sling in a 2-group, 1:1, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Patients were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was defined as urinary continence (0 to 1 pad per day) at 1 month postoperatively. Inclusion criteria were organ confined prostate cancer and a prostate specific antigen less than 15 ng/ml. Exclusion criteria were any prior surgery on the prostate, a history of neurogenic bladder and history of pelvic radiation. A chi-squared test was used for the primary outcome.  Results:   A total of 147 patients were randomized (control 74, sling 73) and 92% were available for primary end point analysis at 1 month. There were no significant differences in baseline or perioperative data except that operating room time was 20.1 minutes longer for the sling group (p=0.04). The continence rate was similar between the control and sling groups at 1 month (47.1% vs 55.2%, p=0.34) and 12 months (86.7% vs 94.5%, p=0.15), respectively. Adverse events were similar between the control and sling groups (10.8% vs 13.7%, p=0.59).  Conclusions:   The application of an absorbable urethral sling at robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was well tolerated with no increase in obstructive symptoms in this randomized trial.

Interestingly, PIN1 is overexpressed in many types of malignancies including breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers. However, its oncogenic functions have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that PIN1 directly interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in human colon cancer (HCT116) cells. PIN1 binding to HIF-1α occurred in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We also found that PIN1 interacted with HIF-1α at both exogenous and endogenous levels. Notably, PIN1 binding stabilized the HIF-1α protein, given that their levels were significantly increased under hypoxic conditions. The stabilization of HIF-1α resulted in increased transcriptional activity, consequently upregulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, a major contributor to angiogenesis. Silencing of PIN1 or pharmacologic inhibition of its activity abrogated the angiogenesis. By utilizing a bioluminescence imaging technique, we were able to demonstrate that PIN1 inhibition dramatically reduced the tumor volume in a subcutaneous mouse xenograft model and angiogenesis as well as hypoxia-induced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α.

Replication‑defective adenoviral vectors, were constructed using the Adxsi system. The virus titer was measured by TCID50 assay, and the expression of the PSMA gene was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) derived DCs in vitro. In addition, a PE‑7AAD apoptosis and necrosis kit was applied to detect the survival of DCs at different MOI values to determine the optimal MOI. Morphological changes of DC were observed under a fluorescence microscope, expression of the PSMA protein was detected by western blotting 48 h after transfection, the expression of DC markers prior to and following transfection was detected by direct immunofluorescence, and the interleukin (IL)-12 concentration in the culture supernatant of the three groups was measured by ELISA. The antitumor effect of DC-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on different PCa cell lines was analyzed using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. The optimal MOI value was determined to be 200. The PSMA protein was expressed in DCs, and the recombinant adenovirus did not impact the maturation and morphological changes of the DCs. The expression levels of the co-stimulatory molecules, CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA‑DR, were significantly higher in the Ad‑PSMA‑DC group than in the other two groups (P<0.05). The concentration of IL‑12 in the supernatant of the Ad‑PSMA‑DC group (79.51±1.60 pg) was comparable with that of the Ad‑GFP‑DC group (not significantly different), and the two were significantly higher than the non‑transfection group (P<0.05). The optimal effector to target (E:T) ratio was determined to be 40:1. However, at the same E:T ratio, the cytotoxic activity of PSMA‑DC‑T against the LNCap cells was markedly stronger than its activity against the other target cells (DU145 and 22RV; P<0.05); furthermore, the the cytotoxic activity of PSMA-DC-T against the LNCap cells was significantly higher than the anti‑LNCap effect of DC‑T cells in other groups (P<0.05).

Considering the rising prevalence of cancer in adults aged 65 and older, PRO data are particularly relevant for older adults with cancer, who often require complex cancer care and have additional comorbid conditions. A data linkage between the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) was created through a partnership between the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that created the opportunity to examine PROs in Medicare Advantage enrollees with and without cancer.

Materials and methods:   A multi-institutional phase II trial was conducted, using a three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) approach for low-risk prostate cancer (T1a-T2a, Gleason ≤ 6 and prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10 ng/ml). Forty-five Gray (Gy) were delivered in nine fractions of 5 Gy given on a weekly basis. Acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity scale. Sexual function and sexual bother were assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire.  Results:   Between March 2006 and August 2008, 80 patients were treated, with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range 64-72). The median follow-up was 83 months (interquartile range 73-85 months). At 7 years, overall survival was 88%. No patients died of prostate cancer. Cumulative grade ≥2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity was reported for 31.3% and 30% of our patients, respectively. Cumulative grade ≥3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity was seen in 3.8% and 12.5% of cases, respectively. Late genitourinary grade 2 toxicity was correlated with the occurrence of acute genitourinary grade 2 toxicity (P = 0.006). The occurrence of late gastrointestinal toxicity was not correlated with acute gastrointestinal toxicity. Pre-treatment EPIC sexual function was low (37.5%) and the mean EPIC sexual function score at 7 years after treatment was 14%. On the other hand, pre-treatment EPIC sexual bother reached 80.5%, meaning little bother, and remained stable during follow-up.  Conclusions:   Once-weekly 3D-CRT leads to excellent biochemical disease-free survival and acceptable toxicities. Pre-treatment EPIC sexual function dropped by 42% at 5 years of follow-up.

Results:   Men with localized prostate cancer in metropolitan counties had 23% higher odds of being treated with surgery or radiation compared with men in rural counties, controlling for number of urologists per county as well as clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Three percent (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-6.2%) of the total variation in treatment was attributable to SEER site, while 6% (95% CI: 4.3-9.0%) of variation was attributable to county of residence, adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.

Research on immunotherapy has been of special interest for the treatment of CRPC for years.  Objective:   To evaluate the safety of personalized peptide vaccine (PPV) immunotherapy and its clinical outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 2 randomized controlled trial of PPV immunotherapy with low-dose dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for chemotherapy-naive CRPC began in 2008. Eligible patients (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <10 ng/ml) were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A02, A24, or A03 superfamily positive and had asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic CRPC. Patients were allocated (1:1) to PPV plus dexamethasone (1mg/d) or to dexamethasone (1mg/d) alone. A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides (each 3mg) was selected based on the preexisting immunoglobulin G responses against the 24 warehouse peptides and administered every 2 wk.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSA, progression-free survival (PFS), time to initiation of chemotherapy, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, a log-rank test, and proportional hazard analysis.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 37 patients received peptide vaccinations and 35 received dexamethasone alone. The primary end point was PSA PFS, which was significantly longer in the vaccination group than in the dexamethasone group (22.0 vs 7.0 mo; p=0.0076). Median OS was also significantly longer in the vaccination group (73.9 vs 34.9 mo; p=0.00084). The relatively small number of patients enrolled is the major limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   PPV immunotherapy was well tolerated and associated with longer PSA PFS and OS in men with chemotherapy-naive CRPC. A larger phase 3 study is needed to confirm our findings.  Patient summary:   We compared clinical outcomes of the treatment with personalized peptide vaccine plus dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone. Our data provide promising evidence of clinical benefit for peptide vaccines.

Objective:   To investigate short- and long-term rates of work disability following RARP and RRP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of 2571 men of working age treated with RARP or RRP between 2007 and 2009 identified in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden. Information about physician-certified sick leave and disability pension was retrieved from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency through 2012.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used Cox regression to calculate time to return to work (RTW, or duration of sick leave) after surgery and used generalised estimating equations to analyse days lost from work (because of sick leave and disability pension) after RTW.  Results and limitations:   Men treated with RARP returned to work after a median of 35 d, whereas the corresponding time for RRP was 48 d (p<0.001). The difference was seen early; within the first month, men treated with RARP returned to work nearly four times faster than men treated with RRP (adjusted relative RTW rate 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04-4.66). During a median of 3.6 yr after return to work, men treated with RARP lost fewer days from work per person-year than men treated with RRP-12 d versus 15 d-but the association was not statistically significant (p=0.10). The adjusted rate ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.82-1.42). One limitation is the nonrandomised design of this study.  Conclusions:   RARP was associated with a faster RTW compared with RRP, but the surgical method did not influence long-term rates of work disability in terms of days lost from work after RTW.

Our previous studies demonstrated that most castration- resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) overexpress the HOXB13 transcription factor to confer positive growth signals. Since HOXB13 also suppresses p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) expression, we studied the correlation between HOXB13 and p21 in selected samples of PCa. While there was no statistically significant correlation between expression of HOXB13 and p21, HOXB13-deficient tumors had three times higher odds for expressing p21 than HOXB13-positive tumors. Moreover, CRPC showed more negative correlation than hormone-dependent PCa (HDPC). Further in vitro proliferation assay demonstrated that androgen did not affect the growth-suppressive function of p21 in androgen-dependent PCa cells, suggesting that p21 seems to override the growth-promoting function of androgen and suppression of p21 expression by HOXB13 is an important step in PCa cell survival under no androgen influence. HOXB13 also inhibited AP-1 signals via suppressed expression of JNK/c-Jun. While HOXB13 suppressed p21 expression via regulation of JNK signals, alteration of p21 expression also affected c-Jun and AP-1 activity. Taken together, overexpression of HOXB13 in CRPC is an important step in avoiding the growth-suppressive effect of p21 in a harsh condition such as an androgen-deprived environment.""","""['Young-Rang Kim', 'Taek Won Kang', 'Phuong Kim To', 'Nguyen Thi Xuan Nguyen', 'Young Seok Cho', 'Chaeyong Jung', 'Min Soo Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['HOXB13 promotes androgen independent growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells by the activation of E2F signaling.', 'HOXB13 induces growth suppression of prostate cancer cells as a repressor of hormone-activated androgen receptor signaling.', 'HOXB13 downregulates intracellular zinc and increases NF-κB signaling to promote prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hoxb13, a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Downstream of the HOX genes: Explaining conflicting tumour suppressor and oncogenic functions in cancer.', 'Interaction Of c-Jun And HOTAIR- Increased Expression Of p21 Converge In Polyphyllin I-Inhibited Growth Of Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Paralogous HOX13 Genes in Human Cancers.', 'Downregulated lncRNA HOXA11-AS Affects Trophoblast Cell Proliferation and Migration by Regulating RND3 and HOXA7 Expression in PE.', 'Synergistic Interaction of HOXB13 and CIP2A Predisposes to Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Conclusions:   For select cancer histologies, aggressive focal therapy of oligometastatic lesions is already the clinical standard of care (i.e. colorectal cancer and sarcomas), while for other tumor types the evidence is still emerging (i.e. prostate, breast, etc.). It is increasingly important, therefore, for the radiologist interpreting oncology patients' staging or restaging examinations to be aware of those diseases for which targeted therapy of oligometastases may be undertaken to effectively guide such management.

Aim of the study was to analyse the impact of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation on psychosocial and physical outcomes in patients after surgery.  Methods:   Six hundred nineteen inpatients and 95 outpatients, treated for localized prostate cancer by prostatectomy, completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and two quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25) at the beginning and end of rehabilitation as well as 12 months after rehabilitation. Data were analysed by using t-tests, chi(2) - tests and analyses of variance with repeated measures.  Results:   Compared to a population sample, patients reported a significantly worse quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and more anxiety (HADS) at the beginning of rehabilitation. Physical, role and social functioning increased significantly over time for in- and outpatients. Patients still reported lower emotional functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30), anxiety (HADS) and prostate cancer-specific physical symptoms (EORTC QLQ-PR25) 1 year after rehabilitation, although symptom levels decreased significantly over time. The setting did not have an independent significant effect in the multivariate model.  Conclusions:   In- and outpatients reported an increased quality of life 1 year after rehabilitation with respect to their physical constitution and their reintegration into social life. Nonetheless, both groups still struggled with problems due to surgery.

ING3 expression and prognostic value was assessed in a cohort of PCa patients (n = 312) treated with transurethral resection of prostate using immumoflourescent automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system. In vitro studies were carried out in conjunction to investigate its expression in various PCa cell lines. ING3 knockdown was also carried out in DU145 cell lines to assess for any changes in invasion and migration. ING3 expression was highest in benign prostate tissues (mean 3.2 ± 0.54) compared to PCa (mean 2.5 ± 0.26) (p = 0.437), advanced prostate cancer (AdvPCa) (mean 1.5 ± 0.32) (p = 0.004), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (mean 2.28 ± 0.32) (p = 0.285). ING3 expression was inversely correlated to Gleason score (p = 0.039) and ETS-related gene (ERG) expression (p = 0.019). Higher ING3 expression was marginally associated with lethal disease (p = 0.052), and this was more pronounced in patients with ERG-negative status (p = 0.018). Inhibition of ING3 in DU145 PCa cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with decreased cell invasion (p = 0.0016) and cell migration compared to control cells. ING3 is significantly associated with PCa disease progression and cancer-specific mortality.

Methods:   The study included 37 patients initially treated with prostatectomy, who were treated due to biochemical recurrence. (11)C-choline PE/CT detected infra-diaphragmatic lymph-node involvement. All were selected for intensity modulated radiation therapy, escalating the dose according to the PET findings. One year after treatment patients underwent PSA and (11)C-choline PET/CT categorizing response (complete/partial/progression). Clinical/biochemical/image monitoring was performed until appearance of second relapse or 36 months in disease-free patients.  Results:   (11)C-choline PET/CT could detect lymph nodes in all 37 patients. They were 18 (48.6%) of more than a centimetre in size and 19 (51.3%) with no pathological CT morphology: 9 (24.3%) with positive lymph nodes of around one centimetre and 10 (27.0%) only less than a centimetre in size.

Design:   The aim of this descriptive study is to compare cancer mortality in all countries with high- or intermediate-quality data on death certificates according to the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for the years 2000 through 2010. We included 60 countries in the analysis and calculated age-adjusted mortality rates for all cancer combined and for the commonest cancers worldwide: lung, stomach, breast, colorectal, uterine, and prostate.  Results:   A decrease in overall cancer mortality rate of ∼1% per year was observed in higher and lower income regions and in both sexes. In 2010, 696 000 cancer deaths were avoided on a global scale compared with 2000 rates (426 000 in men, 271 000 in women). However, the mortality of liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in females increased in many countries'.  Conclusions:   The individual risk of dying from cancer decreased in all countries with reliable data. This decrease was chiefly due to favorable trends in the commonest specific cancers. Liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women, which show increasing mortality rates, constitute a priority for prevention and further research.""","""['D Hashim', 'P Boffetta', 'C La Vecchia', 'M Rota', 'P Bertuccio', 'M Malvezzi', 'E Negri']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Trends in cancer mortality in 15 industrialized countries, 1969-1986.', 'Cancer mortality in the elderly in 11 countries worldwide, 1970-2015.', 'Cancer mortality trends in Spain: 1980-2007.', 'Global Cancer in Women: Burden and Trends.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Prognostic and immune infiltrative biomarkers of CENPO in pan-cancer and its relationship with lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and metastasis.', 'Experience of Pain and Unpleasantness during Mammography Screening: A Cross-Sectional Study on the Roles of Emotional, Cognitive, and Personality Factors.', 'Cancer mortality predictions for 2023 in Latin America with focus on stomach cancer.', 'Time-efficient implantable catheters for draining malignant ascites in terminal cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of knowledge and practice regarding mammography among a group of Turkish women attending a tertiary hospital.']"""

Previous studies have reported on the dietary isoflavone metabolism of several human gut bacteria and the involved enzymes for conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol. However, the anaerobic growth conditions required by the gut bacteria and the low productivity and yield of (S)-equol limit its efficient production using only natural gut bacteria. In this study, the low (S)-equol biosynthesis of gut microorganisms was overcome by cloning the four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis from Slackia isoflavoniconvertens into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The reaction conditions were optimized for (S)-equol production from the recombinant strain, and this recombinant system enabled the efficient conversion of 200 μM and 1 mM daidzein to (S)-equol under aerobic conditions, achieving yields of 95% and 85%, respectively. Since the biosynthesis of trans-tetrahydrodaidzein was found to be a rate-determining step for (S)-equol production, dihydrodaidzein reductase (DHDR) was subjected to rational site-directed mutagenesis. The introduction of the DHDR P212A mutation increased the (S)-equol productivity from 59.0 mg/liter/h to 69.8 mg/liter/h in the whole-cell reaction. The P212A mutation caused an increase in the (S)-dihydrodaidzein enantioselectivity by decreasing the overall activity of DHDR, resulting in undetectable activity for (R)-dihydrodaidzein, such that a combination of the DHDR P212A mutant with dihydrodaidzein racemase enabled the production of (3S,4R)-tetrahydrodaidzein with an enantioselectivity of >99%.""","""['Pyung-Gang Lee', 'Joonwon Kim', 'Eun-Jung Kim', 'EunOk Jung', 'Bishnu Prasad Pandey', 'Byung-Gee Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Appl Environ Microbiol""","""['Identification and expression of genes involved in the conversion of daidzein and genistein by the equol-forming bacterium Slackia isoflavoniconvertens.', 'Biosynthesis of (-)-5-Hydroxy-equol and 5-Hydroxy-dehydroequol from Soy Isoflavone, Genistein Using Microbial Whole Cell Bioconversion.', 'Identification of two novel reductases involved in equol biosynthesis in Lactococcus strain 20-92.', 'Metabolism of dietary soy isoflavones to equol by human intestinal microflora--implications for health.', 'Flavonoid metabolism: the interaction of metabolites and gut microbiota.', 'An improved whole-cell biotransformation system for (S)-equol production.', 'Regioselective One-Pot Synthesis of Hydroxy-(S)-Equols Using Isoflavonoid Reductases and Monooxygenases and Evaluation of the Hydroxyequol Derivatives as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Antioxidants.', 'Maximizing the Estrogenic Potential of Soy Isoflavones through the Gut Microbiome: Implication for Cardiometabolic Health in Postmenopausal Women.', 'Taxonomic distribution and evolutionary analysis of the equol biosynthesis gene cluster.', 'Recent Advances in Heterologous Synthesis Paving Way for Future Green-Modular Bioindustries: A Review With Special Reference to Isoflavonoids.']"""

Using the model, we examined the impact of dose on the tumor and plasma positron emission tomography (PET)-derived time-activity curves. We also sought to predict the optimal targeting index (ratio of integrated-tumor-to-integrated-plasma activity concentrations) for radioimmunotherapy.  Methods:   The equilibrium rates of antibody internalization and turnover in the tumors were derived from PET images up to 96 h post-injection using compartmental modeling with a non-linear transfer rate. In addition, we serially imaged groups of LNCaP tumor-bearing mice injected with (89)Zr-J591 antibody doses ranging from antigen subsaturating to saturating to examine the suitability of using a non-linear approach and derived the time-integrated concentration (in μM∙hours) of administered tracer in tumor as a function of the administered dose of antibody.  Results:   The comparison of (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591 yielded similar model-derived values of the total antigen concentration and internalization rate. The association equilibrium constant (k a) was twofold higher for (124)I, but there was a ~tenfold greater tumoral efflux rate of (124)I from tumor compared to that of (89)Zr. Plots of surface-bound and internalized radiotracers indicate similar behavior up to 24 h p.i. for both (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591, with the effect of differential clearance rates becoming apparent after about 35 h p.i. Estimates of J591/PSMA complex turnover were 3.9-90.5 × 10(12) (for doses from 60 to 240 μg) molecules per hour per gram of tumor (20 % of receptors internalized per hour).  Conclusions:   Using quantitative compartmental model methods, surface binding and internalization rates were shown to be similar for both (124)I-J591 and (89)Zr-J591 forms, as expected. The large difference in clearance rates of the radioactivity from the tumor is likely due to differential trapping of residualizing zirconium versus non-residualizing iodine.

The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of this scale in two samples of cancer patients using classical test theory (CTT).  Methods:   Two samples were used: 121 men with prostate cancer and 136 patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic cancer. All participants completed the PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form as well as validated measures of fatigue, vitality, and depression. HCT patients also completed measures of anxiety, perceived stress, and a clinical interview designed to identify cases of cancer-related fatigue.  Results:   PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form items loaded on a single factor (CFI=0.948) and the scale demonstrated good internal consistency reliability in both samples (Cronbach's alphas>0.86).

The efficacy of radiation treatment highly depends on segmentation accuracy. However, accurate segmentation of male pelvic organs is challenging due to low tissue contrast of CT images, as well as large variations of shape and appearance of the pelvic organs. Among existing segmentation methods, deformable models are the most popular, as shape prior can be easily incorporated to regularize the segmentation. Nonetheless, the sensitivity to initialization often limits their performance, especially for segmenting organs with large shape variations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to guide deformable models, thus making them robust against arbitrary initializations. Specifically, we learn a displacement regressor, which predicts 3D displacement from any image voxel to the target organ boundary based on the local patch appearance. This regressor provides a non-local external force for each vertex of deformable model, thus overcoming the initialization problem suffered by the traditional deformable models. To learn a reliable displacement regressor, two strategies are particularly proposed. 1) A multi-task random forest is proposed to learn the displacement regressor jointly with the organ classifier; 2) an auto-context model is used to iteratively enforce structural information during voxel-wise prediction. Extensive experiments on 313 planning CT scans of 313 patients show that our method achieves better results than alternative classification or regression based methods, and also several other existing methods in CT pelvic organ segmentation.""","""['Yaozong Gao', 'Yeqin Shao', 'Jun Lian', 'Andrew Z Wang', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Robust brain ROI segmentation by deformation regression and deformable shape model.', 'Pelvic Organ Segmentation Using Distinctive Curve Guided Fully Convolutional Networks.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Pelvic Cancers Using Deep Learning: State-of-the-Art Approaches and Challenges.', 'RefineNet-based 2D and 3D automatic segmentations for clinical target volume and organs at risks for patients with cervical cancer in postoperative radiotherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical imaging: A technology review.', 'Methodological approach to create an atlas using a commercial auto-contouring software.', 'Automatic multi-organ segmentation in computed tomography images using hierarchical convolutional neural network.', 'Boundary Coding Representation for Organ Segmentation in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

All surgeries were performed by one surgeon via a transperitoneal approach, with patients uniformly receiving low-molecular-weight heparin. Patients were followed with serial ultrasonography (US) based on a predetermined schedule for lymphocele surveillance. Incidence and sequelae of lymphoceles were retrospectively assessed.  Results:   In all, 521 patients were analysed. The mean (sd) follow-up was 33.5 (22.8) months. Lymphocele developed in 9% and became symptomatic in 2.5%. All except one were detected at the 1-month postoperative US; however, 76% regressed by the 3-month US.

Comparisons of patient characteristics between patients with and without lymphoceles did not show any significant prognostic indicators to predict the occurrence of lymphocele in neither univariate nor multivariate analysis in the present cohort.  Conclusion:   The incidence of symptomatic lymphocele after transperitoneal RARP and eLND is rare. However, during follow-up, US imaging at 3 months after surgery appears advisable.

Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a novel bone resorption marker, has been used gradually in the clinics as a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption for the early diagnosis of cancer patients with bone metastasis. Here, we reported that high concentrations of uric acid (UA) lead to decrease of TRACP 5b levels and determined whether TRACP 5b level was associated with UA in interference experiment.  Methods:   A total of 77 patients with high concentrations of UA and 77 healthy subjects were tested to evaluate the differences in their TRACP 5b levels. Serial dilutions of UA were respectively spiked with a known concentration of TRACP 5b standard sample, then Serum TRACP 5b was detected by using bone TRAP® Assay. A correction equation was set to eliminate UA-derived TRACP 5b false-decrease. The effect of this correction was evaluated in high-UA individuals.  Results:   The average TRACP level of the high-UA individuals (1.47 ± 0.62 U/L) was significantly lower than that of the healthy subjects (2.62 ± 0.63 U/L) (t-test, p < 0.0001). The UA correction equation derived: ΔTRACP 5b = -1.9751lgΔUA + 3.7365 with an R2 = 0.98899. Application of the UA correction equation resulted in a statistically non-significant difference in TRACP 5b values between the healthy subjects and high-UA individuals (p = 0.24).  Conclusions:   High UA concentrations can falsely decrease TRACP 5b levels due to a method-related systematic error. To avoid misdiagnoses or inappropriate therapeutic decisions, increased attention should be paid to UA interference, when TRACP 5b is used for early diagnosis of cancer patients with bone metastasis, evaluation of the aggressiveness of osteosarcoma or prediction of survival in prostate cancer and breast cancer with bone metastases.""","""['Zhi-Qi Wu', 'Yan Zhang', 'Erfu Xie', 'Wei-Juan Song', 'Rui-Xia Yang', 'Cheng-Jing Yan', 'Bing-Feng Zhang', 'Hua-Guo Xu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5B is a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption.', 'Clinical significance of serum BAP, TRACP 5b and ICTP as bone metabolic markers for bone metastasis screening in lung cancer patients.', 'Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b) as a marker of skeletal changes in prostate cancer.', 'Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRACP 5b) as a serum maker for cancer with bone metastasis.', 'Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b as serum marker of bone metabolism in cancer patients.', 'Relationship of Bone Turnover Markers with Serum Uric Acid-to-Creatinine Ratio in Men and Postmenopausal Women with Type 2 Diabetes.', 'High uric acid (UA) downregulates bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) expression through inhibition of its promoter activity.', 'Positive association between serum uric acid and bone mineral density in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus stratified by gender and BMI.', 'The association between the baseline bone resorption marker CTX and incident dysglycemia after 4 years.']"""

Further development of PSA models to monitor men on active surveillance should be undertaken in order to take advantage of these similarities. We found no evidence that guidelines for using PSA to monitor men cannot be passed between US and European studies.""","""['Andrew J Simpkin', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Kate Tilling', 'J Athene Lane', 'Richard M Martin', 'Peter C Albertsen', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'J L H Ruud Bosch', 'Luigi Ferrucci', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Lars Holmberg', 'E Jeffrey Metter', 'David E Neal', 'Christopher C Parker', 'Chris Metcalfe']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Development of a new method for monitoring prostate-specific antigen changes in men with localised prostate cancer: a comparison of observational cohorts.', 'Association Between Lead Time and Prostate Cancer Grade: Evidence of Grade Progression from Long-term Follow-up of Large Population-based Cohorts Not Subject to Prostate-specific Antigen Screening.', 'Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer?', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'A meta-inference framework to integrate multiple external models into a current study.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Current and Future Burden of Prostate Cancer in Songkhla, Thailand: Analysis of Incidence and Mortality Trends From 1990 to 2030.']"""

Robotic assisted radical prostatectomies have been widely adopted in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, replacing the conventional open surgeries. However, it is not clear whether this was achieved by substitution within the same treatment type (i.e., replacing open surgeries with robotic-assisted surgeries) or substitution across treatment types (i.e., expanding the proportion of patients receiving surgery while crowding out other forms of treatment for localized prostate cancer). Given the large number of patients undergoing these procedures each year, it is important to study the impact of the fast diffusion of robotic surgical systems on the overall treatment pattern of localized prostate cancer. We addressed this question using state-level cancer epidemiology data (256 observations) extracted from 2002 to 2010 National Cancer Database, and supply-side variables (e.g. density of robotic surgical systems, urologists) obtained from Area Resource File as well as investor presentations posted at the website of the manufacturer of robotic surgical systems. Recognizing that the purchase decision of robotic systems is potentially endogenous, we used an optimal instrumental variables panel estimation method to examine the impact while taking into account of the panel structure and the potential endogeneity of the density of robotic surgical systems and its quadratic term. We found that the density of robotic systems at state-level had a significantly positive impact on the rate of surgery and a significantly negative impact on the rate of radiation therapy. Further, our age-stratified analysis showed that the increase in surgery rate was most pronounced in the younger population. In conclusion, our findings suggest that part of the increase in the rate of surgery was driven by substitution across treatment types with a large proportion originating from the younger population.""","""['Chan Shen', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['The impact of robotic surgery on the surgical management of prostate cancer in the USA.', 'Patterns of adoption of robotic radical prostatectomy in the United States and England.', 'Utilization and impact of surgical technique on the performance of pelvic lymph node dissection at radical prostatectomy: Results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database.', 'Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a review of the current state of affairs.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Related Medicaid Spending: Evidence from New York State.', 'Prostatectomy versus radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer (PREPaRE) study: protocol for a mixed-methods study of treatment decision-making in men with localised prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we aimed to identify potential 8q target genes associated with clinically aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome-wide mRNA expression, and protein expression analyses. Using FISH, we first characterized the relative copy number of 8q (assessed with MYC flanking probes) of a series of 50 radical prostatectomy specimens, with available global gene expression data and typed for E26 transformation specific (ETS) rearrangements, and then compared the gene expression profile of PCa subsets with and without 8q24 gain using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. In the subset of tumors with ERG fusion genes (ERG+), five genes were identified as significantly overexpressed (false discovery rate [FDR], ≤ 5%) in tumors with relative 8q24 gain, namely VN1R1, ZNF417, CDON, IKZF2, and NCOA2. Of these, only NCOA2 is located in 8q (8q13.3), showing a statistically higher mRNA expression in the subgroup with relative 8q gain, both in the ERG+ subgroup and in the whole series (P = 0.000152 and P = 0.008, respectively). Combining all the cases with NCOA2 overexpression, either at the mRNA or at the protein level, we identified a group of tumors with NCOA2 copy-number increase, independently of ETS status and relative 8q24 gain. Furthermore, for the first time, we detected a structural rearrangement involving NCOA2 in PCa.

Susceptibility of prostate cancer cells LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 to adenovirus infection was associated with CAR expression. All of the prostate cancer cell lines expressed integrin αvβ3 and αvβ5. AxdAdB-3 was more cytopathic in CAR-positive prostate cancer cells than in CAR-negative cells, whereas AxdAdB3-F/RGD caused potent oncolysis in both CAR-positive and CAR-negative prostate cancer cells. In contrast, AxdAdB3-F/RGD was not cytopathic against normal prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1. Intratumoral injection of AxdAdB3-F/RGD into CAR-negative prostate cancer cell xenografts in nude mice inhibited tumor growth. The current study demonstrates that E1A/E1B double-restricted oncolytic adenovirus with an RGD-fiber modification enhances infection efficiency and anti-tumor activity in CAR-deficient prostate cancer cells, while sparing normal cells.

Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with reduced disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. However, the association between PTEN loss, TAM infiltration and radiotherapy response of CaP cells remains to be evaluated. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of surgically-resected Gleason 7 tumors confirmed that PTEN loss correlated with increased CXCL8 expression and macrophage infiltration. However PTEN status had no discernable correlation with expression of other inflammatory markers by CaP cells, including TNF-α. In vitro, exposure to conditioned media harvested from irradiated PTEN null CaP cells induced chemotaxis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells, a response partially attenuated by CXCL8 inhibition. Co-culture with THP-1 cells resulted in a modest reduction in the radio-sensitivity of DU145 cells. Cytokine profiling revealed constitutive secretion of TNF-α from CaP cells irrespective of PTEN status and IR-induced TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells. THP-1-derived TNF-α increased NFκB pro-survival activity and elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in CaP cells, which could be attenuated by pre-treatment with a TNF-α neutralizing antibody. Treatment with a novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, decreased basal and TNF-α-induced cIAP-1 expression in CaP cells, switched TNF-α signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic and increased radiation sensitivity of CaP cells in co-culture with THP-1 cells.

Ezrin and integrin co-ordinate these processes by regulating cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal polymerization-depolymerization. It is also well established that chemokine-chemokine receptor axis plays a crucial role in regulating cancer cell migration and invasion. In this study, we show involvement of CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) and its only natural ligand CXCL16 in pathobiology of prostate cancer (PCa). CXCR6 is highly expressed in PCa tissues and cell lines (LNCaP and PC3), relative to normal tissue and cells. CXCR6 expression in PCa tissues correlated with higher Gleason score. Similarly, aggressive PCa cells (PC3) show high CXCR6 compared to less aggressive LNCaP. Besides, PC3 cells show higher MMPs expression compared to LNCaP cells following CXCL16 stimulation. Intriguingly, CXCR6-CXCL16 interaction in PCa cells promotes Ezrin activation, αvβ3 integrin clustering and capping at the leading edge in FAK/PI3K/PKC dependent manner, thereby modifying cellular adhesion as well as motility.

Methods and materials:   Four hundred ninety-four patients with stage ≤T2b prostate cancer, Gleason score ≤7, and prostate-specific antigen levels ≤15 ng/mL underwent HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy. Of those, 319 received 38 Gy in 4 fractions, 79 received 24 Gy in 2 fractions, and 96 received 27 Gy in 2 fractions. Acute and chronic genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were defined as side effects occurring ≤6 and >6 months, respectively, after radiation therapy (RT) and were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. The time to toxicity was calculated from the date of RT completion. Variables were analyzed with χ(2) test. P values <.05 were considered significant.  Results:   The median overall follow-up time was 4 years (range, 5.5, 3.5, and 2.5 years for 38 Gy, 24 Gy, and 27 Gy, respectively, P<.001). Acute and chronic grade ≥2 GU and GI toxicity profiles were similar among groups. Acceptable rates of grade 2 GU toxicities were seen with overall acute/chronic frequency/urgency, dysuria, retention, incontinence, and hematuria rates of 14%/20%, 6%/7%, 7%/4%, 1.5%/2%, and 1.5%/7%, respectively. Minimal grade 3 and no grade 4 or 5 toxicities were seen. Grade 1, 2, and 3 chronic urethral stricture rates were 0.3%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. All GI toxicities were similar between groups, with overall rates of acute/chronic grade 2 diarrhea, rectal pain/tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and proctitis of 1%/1%, <1%/0.5%, 0%/2%, and <1%/1%, respectively. No grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicities were seen. All comparisons were similar for hormone-naïve patients. The median time to maximal GU/GI toxicity was similar between groups, ranging from 1 to 1.6 to 0.9 to 1.2 years, respectively. There were no differences in clinical outcomes between the 3 groups at 5 years.  Conclusions:   The acute and chronic toxicity profiles associated with these 3 HDR brachytherapy schedules were similar and were well tolerated. Acceptable grade 2, minimal grade 3, and no grade 4 or 5 toxicities were seen.

We previously reported that several small dsRNAs targeting the PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator (PAWR) promoter can upregulate PAWR gene expression effectively in human cancer cells. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor potential of PAWR gene induction by these saRNAs in prostate cancer cells. Promisingly, we found that upregulation of PAWR by saRNA inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis which was related to inactivation of the NF-κB and Akt pathways. The decreased anti‑apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and activation of the caspase cascade and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) also supported the efficacy of the treatment. Overall, these data suggest that activation of PAWR by saRNA may have a therapeutic benefit for prostate and other types of cancer.""","""['Kai Yang', 'Jie Shen', 'Shan-Wen Chen', 'Jie Qin', 'Xiang-Yi Zheng', 'Li-Ping Xie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Antitumor Activity of Small Activating RNAs Induced PAWR Gene Activation in Human Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Promoter-targeted double-stranded small RNAs activate PAWR gene expression in human cancer cells.', 'PAWR-mediated suppression of BCL2 promotes switching of 3-azido withaferin A (3-AWA)-induced autophagy to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Development of Therapeutic dsP21-322 for Cancer Treatment.', 'Current Advances in Small Activating RNAs for Gene Therapy: Principles, Applications and Challenges.', 'Modulating the expression of tumor suppressor genes using activating oligonucleotide technologies as a therapeutic approach in cancer.', 'CircHSPG2 absence weakens hypoxia-induced dysfunction in cardiomyocytes by targeting the miR-25-3p/PAWR axis.', 'Protective Signature of IFNγ-Stimulated Microglia Relies on miR-124-3p Regulation From the Secretome Released by Mutant APP Swedish Neuronal Cells.', 'Deconvolution of the epigenetic age discloses distinct inter-personal variability in epigenetic aging patterns.', 'Analysis of Expression Profiles of CircRNA and MiRNA in Oviduct during the Follicular and Luteal Phases of Sheep with Two Fecundity (FecB Gene) Genotypes.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hydrogel spacer (HS) in the interfraction prostate motion in patients undergoing RT for prostate cancer. Material and methods Twenty prostate cancer patients implanted with three fiducial markers (FM) with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) HS were analyzed. Displacements between the prostate isocenter based on the FM's position and the bony anatomy were quantified in the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI) axes by offline analyses of 122 cone beam computed tomography scans. Group systematic (M), systematic (Σ) and random (σ) setup errors were determined. Results In patients with or without HS, the overall mean interfraction prostate displacements were 0.4 versus -0.4 mm (p = 0.0001), 0.6 versus 0.6 mm (p = 0.85), and -0.6 mm versus -0.3 mm (p = 0.48) for the LR, AP, and SI axes, respectively. Prostate displacements >5 mm in the AP and SI directions were similar for both groups. No differences in M, Σ and σ setup errors were observed in the three axes between HS + or HS- patients. Conclusions HS implantation does not significantly influence the interfraction prostate motion in patients treated with RT for prostate cancer. The major expected benefit of HS is a reduction of the high-dose levels to the rectal wall without influence in prostate immobilization.""","""['Cristina Picardi', 'Michel Rouzaud', 'Melpomeni Kountouri', 'Laetitia Lestrade', 'Jean Paul Vallée', 'Francesca Caparrotti', 'Angèle Dubouloz', 'Raymond Miralbell', 'Thomas Zilli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer using 3 different techniques: localization data of 186 patients.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Dosimetric Effects of the Supine and Prone Positions in Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Are simple verbal instructions sufficient to ensure that bladder volume does not deteriorate prostate position reproducibility during spot scanning proton therapy?', 'Injection of hydrogel spacer increased maximal intrafractional prostate motion in anterior and superior directions during volumetric modulated arc therapy-stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Sexual organ-sparing with hydrogel spacer injections for rectal cancer radiotherapy: a feasibility pilot study.', 'Preliminary analysis of prostate positional displacement using hydrogel spacer during the course of proton therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 13,997 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2006 to 2013. Known prognosticators were compared according to age at radical prostatectomy in 13,732 patients younger than 75 years vs 265 patients 75 years old or older. Univariate and multivariate Cox regressions were used to estimate the impact of age on biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer specific and overall survival.  Results:   Median followup was 47.3 months. Compared to patients younger than 75 years those 75 years old or older had a higher pathological Gleason score (p <0.001) and were more likely to harbor a nonorgan confined tumor (p <0.001), have a positive surgical margin (p = 0.004) and positive lymph nodes (p = 0.028), and receive salvage androgen deprivation therapy (p = 0.002). Five-year biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer specific and overall survival rates were 64.2%, 84.7%, 98.4% and 91.3% in patients 75 years old or older, and 76.9%, 96.2%, 99.0% and 96.2%, respectively, in patients younger than 75 years. On univariate and multivariate analysis age 75 years or greater was associated with worse biochemical recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. Patients 75 years old or older were more likely to die of other causes than cancer. Nevertheless, noncancer related mortality was low.  Conclusions:   Older patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had more advanced disease. Age itself is an independent predictor of worse biochemical recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. Healthy and highly selected patients 75 years old or older in our sample showed good long-term overall survival. Therefore, older age in well selected men should not be a contraindication to radical prostatectomy, especially in patients harboring high risk disease.""","""['Philipp Mandel', 'Maximilian C Kriegmair', 'Janneke Kleine Kamphake', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Risk Stratification of pN+ Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy from a Large Single Institutional Series with Long-Term Followup.', 'Obesity and long-term survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Normal preoperative endogenous testosterone levels predict prostate cancer progression in elderly patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Advanced age portends poorer prognosis after radical prostatectomy: a single center experience.', 'The influence of age on prostate cancer screening index.', 'The role of fatal family history and mode of inheritance in prostate cancer for long-term outcomes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic factors for overall survival in prostate cancer patients with different site-specific visceral metastases: A study of 1358 patients.']"""

Herein, we present a rare case of IgG4-related disease presenting as inflammatory pseudotumor lesion, involving the renal pelvis and also neighboring renal parenchyma.  Case presentation:   A 75-year-old man with no history of IgG4-related disease underwent computed tomography (CT) scan for evaluation of prostatic cancer. The CT scan incidentally revealed a mass lesion located at the right renal pelvis. Radiologic findings were highly suggestive of malignancy. Therefore, the patient underwent right nephroureterectomy. Microscopically, the mass lesion showed storiform fibrosis with diffuse and intense inflammatory cell infiltration. Infiltrating cells were mainly histiocytes and plasma cells. Tubulointerstitium adjacent to the lesion also showed fibrosis with abundant plasmacytic infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells in both the mass lesion and tubulointerstitium (mean of 94/HPF per field).

However no analytical method has been proposed for quality control of nutraceuticals with this substance yet. In this paper a new high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using core-shell column for separation of indole-3-carbinol and its condensation/degradation products was developed and used for the quantitative determination of indole-3-carbinol in nutraceuticals. Separation of indole-3-carbinol, its condensation/degradation products and internal standard ethylparaben was performed on the core-shell column Kinetex 5μ XB-C18 100A (100×4.6mm), particle size 5.0μm, with mobile phase acetonitrile/water according to the gradient program at a flow rate of 1.25mLmin(-1) and at temperature 50°C. The detection wavelength was set at 270nm. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions good linearity of determination was achieved. Available commercial samples of nutraceuticals were extracted with 100% methanol using ultrasound bath. A 5-μL sample volume of the supernatant was directly injected into the HPLC system. The developed method provided rapid and accurate tool for quality control of nutraceuticals based on cruciferous vegetable extracts with indole-3-carbinol content. The presented study showed that the declared content of indole-3-carbinol significantly varied in the different nutraceuticals available on the market. Two analyzed preparations showed the presence of condensation/degradation products of indole-3-carbinol which were not officially declared by the manufacturer.

Objective:   To compare the diagnostic performance of simultaneous gallium 68 (68Ga)-PSMA HBED-CC PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for localization of primary PCa with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and PET alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI in 66 men with biopsy-proven PCa.  Intervention:   PET, mpMRI, and combined 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI were independently evaluated using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria or a 5-point Likert scale.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The prostate was divided into sextants for histopathology and coregistered with imaging. Diagnostic performance for localization of malignancy was calculated based on receiver operating characteristics analysis for each modality. Regional quantitative PET tracer uptake was recorded; uptake ratio was defined as the ratio of malignant to nonmalignant prostate tissue.  Results and limitations:   A total of 53 of 66 patients were eligible for analysis. mpMRI, PET, and PET/MRI detected cancer in 66% (35 of 53), 92% (49 of 53), and 98% (52 of 53) of the patients, respectively. Overall, 202 of 318 sextants (63.5%) contained cancer at pathologic examination. Simultaneous PET/MRI statistically outperformed mpMRI (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.88 vs 0.73; p<0.001) and PET imaging (AUC: 0.88 vs 0.83; p=0.002) for localization of PCa. Compared with mpMRI, PET imaging was more accurate (AUC: 0.83 vs 0.73; p=0.003). PET provided a high uptake ratio between malignant versus nonmalignant tissue (5.02 [range: 0.89-29.8]), but no significant correlation was observed between quantitative PET parameters and Gleason score or prostate-specific antigen value.  Conclusions:   Simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI improves diagnostic accuracy for PCa localization both compared with mpMRI and with PET imaging alone.

These complexes demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines when compared to cisplatin. Specifically, complex 2 was the most potent cytotoxic agent against MCF-7 breast cells, while complexes 1 and 3 were more active in DU-145 prostate cells. Binding of complexes to ctDNA was determined by UV-vis titration and viscosity measurements and revealed binding constant (Kb) values in range of 1.0-4.9×10(3)M(-1), which are characteristic of compounds possessing weak affinity to ctDNA. In addition, these complexes presented antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi.

A cutoff of ≥5 CTCs/7.5ml blood in the CellSearch Epithelial Cell Test has been shown to stratify prognostic groups and predict outcome of abiraterone treatment. In contrast, the value of CTC detection in men with localized prostrate cancer before radical prostatectomy (RP) is unknown.  Materials and methods:   A total of 152 patients treated with RP between 06/2009 and 09/2009 were included. Peripheral venous blood drawn the day before RP was evaluated for CTCs by the CellSearch system. The detection of CTCs was correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the histopathological outcome of the RP specimen. A cutoff of 0 vs. ≥1 CTC/7.5ml blood was defined as the threshold for positive vs. negative CTC status.  Results:   Median age was 62 years and median PSA was 6.7ng/dl. Staging revealed 62.5% pT2, 26.3% pT3a, and 11.2% pT3b tumors, and high-grade disease (≥Gleason 4+3) was determined in 25.6% of patients. CTCs were detected in 17 patients (11%) with a median CTC count/7.5ml of 1 (range: 1-clusters with>100 epithelial cells) without significant correlations to PSA levels, pT stage, or Gleason scores. Postoperative pT stage was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in univariable logistic regression models and as a composite measure together with positive CTC counts (P<0.0001). CTC positivity alone tended to have a higher hazard ratio for BCR, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.1). After a median follow-up of 48 months, there was no significant difference in BCR-free survival between patients with or without CTCs (P = 0.7).  Conclusion:   Using the CellSearch system, we infrequently detected CTCs in patients with localized tumors before RP. The detection of CTCs did not correlate significantly with PSA, disease characteristics, or the development of BCR. However, larger cohorts with extended follow-up are needed to validate our findings.""","""['Christian P Meyer', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Petra Stroelin', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Sabine Riethdorf', 'Thomas Steuber']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Preoperative characteristics of men with unfavorable high-Gleason prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Patients at PSA Recurrence and Review of the Literature.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Protocol for a prospective study evaluating circulating tumour cells status to predict radical prostatectomy treatment failure in localised prostate cancer patients (C-ProMeta-1).', 'Liquid Biopsy in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells from Seminal Fluid of Patients with Prostate Cancer Using Inertial Microfluidics.']"""

Objective:   To examine the outcomes of MIRP vs. open radical prostatectomy (OPRP) stratified by age.  Subjects and methods:   We examined the Surveillance, End Results and Epidemiology-Medicare database between years 2004 and 2009 for men with nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Our cohort (n = 12,092) was subdivided into 2 groups-MIRP vs. OPRP, and by patient age≥70 years (n = 6,660) vs. 66 to 69 years (n = 5,432). Multivariate analysis and multiple Cox proportional hazard models evaluated the influence of surgical approach and other variables on perioperative and postoperative complications in each age group.  Results:   The use of MIRP increased over the 6-year time span (14.8%-73.3%;<70y) and 15.1%-69.8%;≥70y). OPRP was associated with a higher risk of blood transfusion and postoperative respiratory or genitourinary (GU) complications. Patients who underwent MIRP were more likely to have a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence compared to OPRP (56.9% vs. 42.2% and 53.9% vs. 43.2%, respectively; P<0.0001). Patients who underwent MIRP were less likely to have an anastomotic stricture or require additional cancer therapy. Men aged≥70 years, who underwent MIRP had higher rates of transfusion, GU complications, length of stay, incontinence, and anastomotic stricture rates compared with those of men aged 66 to 69 years. However, older men undergoing MIRP had 10% lower rates of erectile dysfunction compared with that of men aged 66 to 69 years of age.  Conclusions:   MIRP increased to>70% of all procedures performed in 2009. MIRP is associated with lower blood transfusion rates, postoperative respiratory or GU complications, anastomotic stricture diagnoses, and additional cancer therapies. This suggests that MIRP is a successful prostate cancer treatment for older patients.""","""['Oluwakayode Adejoro', 'Priyanka Gupta', 'Matthew Ziegelmann', 'Christopher Weight', 'Badrinath Konety']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Comparative effectiveness of minimally invasive vs open radical prostatectomy.', 'The effect of minimally invasive and open radical prostatectomy surgeon volume.', 'Temporal national trends of minimally invasive and retropubic radical prostatectomy outcomes from 2003 to 2007: results from the 100% Medicare sample.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Morbidity of radical prostatectomy for localized cancer of the prostate.

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer metastasis is critical for effective therapeutic intervention. In this study, we performed gene-expression profiling of prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSC) derived from DU145 human prostate cancer cells to identify factors involved in metastatic progression. Our studies revealed contactin 1 (CNTN1), a neural cell adhesion protein, to be a prostate cancer-promoting factor. CNTN1 knockdown reduced PCSC-mediated tumor initiation, whereas CNTN1 overexpression enhanced prostate cancer cell invasion in vitro and promoted xenograft tumor formation and lung metastasis in vivo. In addition, CNTN1 overexpression in DU145 cells and corresponding xenograft tumors resulted in elevated AKT activation and reduced E-cadherin (CDH1) expression. CNTN1 expression was not readily detected in normal prostate glands, but was clearly evident on prostate cancer cells in primary tumors and lymph node and bone metastases. Tumors from 637 patients expressing CNTN1 were associated with prostate cancer progression and worse biochemical recurrence-free survival following radical prostatectomy (P < 0.05). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CNTN1 promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis, prompting further investigation into the mechanisms that enable neural proteins to become aberrantly expressed in non-neural malignancies.""","""['Judy Yan', 'Diane Ojo', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Xiaozeng Lin', 'Jehonathan H Pinthus', 'Tariq Aziz', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Fengxiang Wei', 'Nicholas Wong', 'Jason De Melo', 'Jean-Claude Cutz', 'Pierre Major', 'Geoffrey Wood', 'Hao Peng', 'Damu Tang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['PI3K/AKT pathway regulates E-cadherin and Desmoglein 2 in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'IQGAP2, A candidate tumour suppressor of prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Overexpression of Contactin 1 promotes growth, migration and invasion in Hs578T breast cancer cells.', 'Contactin 1: An Important and Emerging Oncogenic Protein Promoting Cancer Progression and Metastasis.', 'Contactin 1: A potential therapeutic target and biomarker in gastric cancer.', 'MicroRNA-200c-targeted contactin 1 facilitates the replication of influenza A virus by accelerating the degradation of MAVS.', 'Prediction of potential prognostic biomarkers in metastatic prostate cancer based on a circular RNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA regulatory network.', 'Autophagy provides a conceptual therapeutic framework for bone metastasis from prostate cancer.', 'LINC00184 Promotes Ovarian Cancer Cells Proliferation and Cisplatin Resistance by Elevating CNTN1 Expression via Sponging miR-1305.', 'Lentivirus-mediated silencing of CNTN1 enhances gefitinib sensitivity by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.']"""

Zoledronic acid (ZA) is commonly combined with docetaxel in practice but lacks evidence that combining is effective, and strontium-89 (Sr89) is generally used palliatively in patients unfit for chemotherapy. Phase 2 analysis of the TRAPEZE trial confirmed combining the agents was safe and feasible, and the objectives of phase 3 include assessment of the treatments on survival.  Objective:   To determine clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combining docetaxel, ZA, and Sr89, all having palliative benefits and used in bony metastatic CRPC to control bone symptoms and, for docetaxel, to prolong survival.  Design, setting, and participants:   The TRAPEZE trial is a 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing docetaxel alone or with ZA, Sr89, or both. A cohort of 757 participants were recruited between February 2005 and February 2012 from hospitals in the United Kingdom. Overall, 169 participants (45%) had received palliative radiotherapy, and the median (IQR) prostate-specific antigen level was 146 (51-354). Follow-ups were performed for at least 12 months.  Interventions:   Up to 10 cycles of docetaxel alone; docetaxel with ZA; docetaxel with a single Sr89 dose after 6 cycles; or docetaxel with both ZA and Sr89.  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcomes included clinical progression-free survival (CPFS) (pain progression, skeletal-related events [SREs], or death) and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes included SRE-free interval, pain progression-free interval, total SREs, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Overall, of 757 participants, 349 (46%) completed docetaxel treatment. Median (IQR) age was 68 (63-73) years. Clinical progression-free survival did not reach statistical significance for either Sr89 or ZA. Cox regression analysis adjusted for all stratification variables showed benefit of Sr89 on CPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.99; P = .03) and confirmed no effect of ZA (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85-1.14; P = .81); ZA had a significant effect on SRE-free interval (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.95; P = .01).

Conclusions and relevance:   Strontium-89 combined with docetaxel improved CPFS but did not improve OS, SRE-free interval, or total SREs; ZA did not improve CPFS or OS but did significantly improve median SRE-free interval and reduced total SREs by around one-third, suggesting a role as postchemotherapy maintenance therapy.

Design:   A nested case-control study was carried out among 96 650 participants, cancer free at baseline, with available mouthwash samples in 2 prospective cohort studies: (1) the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort and (2) the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Incident cases of HNSCC (n = 132) were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up in both cohorts. Three controls per case (n = 396) were selected through incidence density sampling and matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection.  Methods:   Through a next-generation sequencing assay, DNA from α-, β-, and γ-HPV types were detected. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusting for smoking history, alcohol consumption, and detection of HPV-16 for β- and γ-HPVs.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incident HNSCC, which includes cancers of the oropharynx, oral cavity, and larynx.  Results:   A total of 132 participants developed HNSCC during the follow-up period (103 men and 29 women; average age at baseline, 66.5 years). Oral HPV-16 detection was associated with incident HNSCC (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.2-22.6), with positive association for oropharyngeal SCC (OR, 22.4; 95% CI, 1.8-276.7), but not for oral cavity (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 0.6-34.7) or laryngeal SCCs (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-834.80). Detection of β1-HPV-5 and β2-HPV-38 types, as well as γ-11 and γ-12 species, had ORs for HNSCC that ranged from 2.64 to 5.45 (P < .01 for all comparisons). Detection of β1-HPV-5 type was associated with oropharyngeal (OR, 7.42; 95% CI, 0.98-56.82; P = .054), oral cavity (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.51-18.80; P = .01), and laryngeal SCCs (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.00-7.43; P = .05), whereas γ11- and γ12-HPV species were associated with both oral cavity (OR, 7.47; 95% CI, 1.21-46.17; P = .03; and OR, 6.71; 95% CI, 1.47-30.75; P = .01, respectively) and laryngeal SCCs (OR, 7.49; 95% CI, 1.10-51.04; P = .04 and OR, 5.31; 95% CI, 1.13-24.95; P = .03, respectively).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study demonstrates that HPV-16 detection precedes the incidence of oropharyngeal SCC. Associations of other HPVs, including γ11- and γ12-HPV species and β1-HPV-5 type suggest a broader role for HPVs in HNSCC etiology.""","""['Ilir Agalliu', 'Susan Gapstur', 'Zigui Chen', 'Tao Wang', 'Rebecca L Anderson', 'Lauren Teras', 'Aimée R Kreimer', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Robert D Burk']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Association of Oral Microbiome With Risk for Incident Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.', 'Human Papillomavirus and Risk of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Iran.', 'Oral Alpha, Beta, and Gamma HPV Types and Risk of Incident Esophageal Cancer.', 'Human papillomavirus types in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas worldwide: a systematic review.', 'HPV-associated head and neck cancers in the Asia Pacific: A critical literature review & meta-analysis.', 'Protein-DNA Interactions Regulate Human Papillomavirus DNA Replication, Transcription, and Oncogenesis.', 'The effectiveness of HPV vaccination on the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers in men: a review.', 'Prevalence of oral and blood oncogenic human papillomavirus biomarkers among an enriched screening population: Baseline results of the MOUTH study.', 'Dynamics of oral human papillomavirus infection in healthy population and head and neck cancer.', 'Treating Head and Neck Cancer in the Age of Immunotherapy: A 2023 Update.']"""

Despite advances in treatment, the mechanisms involved in progression are still unclear. New prognostic markers are needed to better design patient-specific therapeutic regimens.  Materials and methods:   The present study included 120 patients: 76 with prostate carcinoma, 12 with low-grade prostate intraepithelial lesions, 12 with high-grade prostate intraepithelial lesions, and 20 with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical study was performed for Golgi phosphoprotein-3 (GOLPH3) and Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) analysis. The correlation with clinicopathologic data and overall survival was analyzed.  Results:   Both GOLPH3 and YB-1 showed increased expression from benign to malignant tumors. In prostate carcinoma, cytoplasmic GOLPH3 was associated with Gleason score, tumor stage, and androgen receptor status (P = .034, P < .001, and P = .008, respectively). Nuclear YB-1 expression was associated with Gleason score and androgen receptor status (P = .018 and P = .024, respectively). Cytoplasmic YB-1 expression was associated with Gleason score, tumor stage, and androgen receptor status (P = .008, P = .027, and P < .001, respectively). A high Gleason score (P = .004), high tumor stage (P < .001), and androgen receptor-independent cancer (P = .006) were the only detected adverse prognostic clinicopathologic factors. Moderate to intense GOLPH3 and high nuclear and cytoplasmic YB-1 expression correlated with shorter overall survival (P < .001, P = .020, and P < .001, respectively). On multivariate analysis, moderate to intense GOLPH3 expression was the only predictor of overall survival (P = .025).  Conclusion:   High GOLPH3 and nuclear/cytoplasmic YB-1 expression correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.

Methods:   Cohen's Kappa coefficients were calculated to investigate test-retest reliability across modes of administration. Logistic regression models explored patients' characteristics associated with the magnitude of urinary/bowel/sexual problem. Sensitivities and specificities of the telephone mode in reference to ""gold standard"" were further measured.  Results:   From 221 men who agreed to participate in the study, 168 (76.0%) returned completed surveys. Kappa-linear model resulted in a moderate agreement across the urinary/bowel/sexual bother scores for both modes of administration; with greatest concordance recorded for bowel bother (90%).

Sensitivity tests revealed that 68% of men with a moderate/big problem during the phone interviews would respond to suffering from a moderate/big sexual problem.

After assessment of tolerability at multiple doses of 160 mg/day for 4 weeks, post-docetaxel patients with CRPC and measurable disease were enrolled into phase II; receiving long-term administration of enzalutamide 160 mg/day.  Results:   Nine and 38 patients were enrolled in phase I and II, respectively. During phase I, enzalutamide was well tolerated in each cohort; PK parameters were similar to those of non-Japanese populations in other studies. By week 12, overall response rate was 5.3 % and clinical benefit rate was 47.4 %. Prostate-specific antigen response rate (≥50 % reduction from baseline) was 28.9 %.

The aim of the study was to characterize patients' preferences according to their sex, age, socioeconomic status and according to DRE-related variables.  Material and methods:   Patients admitted to the Department of General and Colorectal Surgery at Medical University in Łódź between October 2014 and June 2015 were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their sex, age, ethnic background, socioeconomic status and preference for a physician performing the DRE during admission to the surgical ward.  Results:   The study enrolled 225 patients, 52% (n=117) women and 48% (n=108) men. Most patients 73.3% (n=244) expressed no preference for sex of the physician performing the DRE during admission, while 22.7% (n=51) preferred a same-sex physician. Analysis showed that the age, female sex, lower education status, small amount of comorbidities and number of hospitalizations, and no previous colonoscopy experience were all associated with preference for a same-sex physician.  Conclusions:   In our study most patients expressed no preference for sex of the physician performing the DRE during admission to the surgical ward.

We sought to validate the comprehensive NCI (National Cancer Institute) experience with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and fusion guided biopsy in an external, independent, matched cohort of patients.  Materials and methods:   We compared 620 patients enrolled in a prospective trial comparing systematic biopsy to fusion guided biopsy at NCI to 310 who underwent a similar procedure at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. The propensity score, defined as the probability of being treated outside NCI, was calculated using the estimated logistic regression model. Patients from the hospital were matched 1:1 for age, prostate specific antigen, magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score and prior negative biopsies. Clinically significant disease was defined as Gleason 3 + 4 or greater.  Results:   Before matching we found differences between the cohorts in age, magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score (each p <0.001), the number of patients with prior negative biopsies (p = 0.01), and the overall cancer detection rate and the cancer detection rate by fusion guided biopsy (each p <0.001). No difference was found in the rates of upgrading by fusion guided biopsy (p = 0.28) or upgrading to clinically significant disease (p = 0.95). A statistically significant difference remained in the overall cancer detection rate and the rate by fusion guided biopsy after matching. On subgroup analysis we found a difference in the overall cancer detection rate and the rate by fusion guided biopsy (p <0.001 and 0.003) in patients with prior negative systematic biopsy but no difference in the 2 rates (p = 0.39 and 0.51, respectively) in biopsy naïve patients.

Usually, it is the wild-type p53 protein, rather than mutants, which exhibits potent cancer-inhibiting effects. In addition, nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, share almost identical genome sequences with humans. This prompted us to speculate whether dsP53-285 can trigger wild-type p53 protein expression in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells and consequently suppress cell growth. The human PCa cell lines LNCaP and DU145 were transfected with dsP53-285 for 72 hours. Compared with the dsControl and mock transfection groups, expression of both p53 messenger RNA and p53 protein was significantly enhanced after dsP53-285 transfection, and this enhancement was followed by upregulation of p21, which indirectly indicated that dsP53-285 induced wild-type p53 expression. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type p53 mediated by dsP53-285 downregulated the expression of Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, thereby inducing PCa cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and then inhibiting cell proliferation and clonogenicity. More importantly, dsP53-285 suppressed PCa cells mainly by modulating wild-type p53 expression. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that dsP53-285 can significantly stimulate wild-type p53 expression in the human PCa cell lines LNCaP and DU145 and can exert potent antitumor effects.""","""['Qiangqiang Ge', 'Chenghe Wang', 'Yajun Ruan', 'Zhong Chen', 'Jihong Liu', 'Zhangqun Ye']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Targeted p53 activation by saRNA suppresses human bladder cancer cells growth and metastasis.', 'The reactivation of P53 by saRNA affects the biological behavior in vitro in gastric cancer cells.', 'Enhanced wild-type p53 expression by small activating RNA dsP53-285 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in pheochromocytoma cell line PC12.', 'Persistent p21Cip1 induction mediates G(1) cell cycle arrest by methylseleninic acid in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Indole-3-carbinol mediated cell cycle arrest of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells requires the induced production of activated p53 tumor suppressor protein.', 'Targeted p21 activation by a new double stranded RNA suppresses human prostate cancer cells growth and metastasis.', 'RNA activation technique and its applications in cancer research.', 'SaRNA-mediated activation of TRPV5 reduces renal calcium oxalate deposition in rat via decreasing urinary calcium excretion.', 'Depletion of pro-oncogenic RUNX2 enhances gemcitabine (GEM) sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells through the induction of pro-apoptotic TAp63.', 'A novel hypoxia-induced miR-147a regulates cell proliferation through a positive feedback loop of stabilizing HIF-1α.']"""

In addtion, to improve their bioavailability and reduce their metabolism, we encapsulated sorafenib and nilotinib into styrene-co-maleic acid micelles. The micelles' charge, size, and release rate were characterized. We assessed the effect of the combination on the cytotoxicity, cell cycle, apoptosis, protein expression, tumor spheroid integrity, migration, and invasion. The micelles exhibited a mean diameter of 100 nm, a neutral charge, and appeared highly stable. The micellar TKIs promoted greater cytotoxicity, decreased cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis relative to the free TKIs. In addition, the combination reduced the expression and activity of several tyrosine kinases and reduced tumor spheroid integrity and metastatic potential of CRPC cell lines more efficiently than the single treatments. The combination increased the therapeutic potential and demonstrated the relevance of a targeted combination therapy for the treatment of CRPC.

Methods:   We linked Western Washington SEER Cancer Registry records with federal bankruptcy records for the region. By using propensity score matching to account for differences in several demographic and clinical factors between patients who did and did not file for bankruptcy, we then fit Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between bankruptcy filing and survival.  Results:   Between 1995 and 2009, 231,596 persons were diagnosed with cancer. Patients who filed for bankruptcy (n = 4,728) were more likely to be younger, female, and nonwhite, to have local- or regional- (v distant-) stage disease at diagnosis, and have received treatment. After propensity score matching, 3,841 patients remained in each group (bankruptcy v no bankruptcy). In the matched sample, mean age was 53.0 years, 54% were men, mean income was $49,000, and majorities were white (86%), married (60%), and urban (91%) and had local- or regional-stage disease at diagnosis (84%). Both groups received similar initial treatments. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality among patients with cancer who filed for bankruptcy versus those who did not was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.64 to 1.96). Hazard ratios varied by cancer type: colorectal, prostate, and thyroid cancers had the highest hazard ratios. Excluding patients with distant-stage disease from the models did not have an effect on results.

Few studies have examined the association between periodontal disease and cancer.  Patients and methods:   A total of 19 933 men reported being never smokers (of cigarette, pipes or cigars) in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Periodontal disease status and teeth number were self-reported at baseline and during follow-up. All cancers were ascertained during 26 years of follow-up. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) adjusting for risk factors.  Results:   A 13% increase in total cancer was observed among men reporting periodontitis at baseline, and a 45% increase in risk was observed among men with advanced periodontitis (periodontitis with <17 remaining teeth). Periodontitis was not associated with prostate cancer, colorectal cancer or melanoma, the three most common cancers in this cohort of never smokers, but a 33% increase in risk was observed for smoking-related cancers (lung, bladder, oropharnygeal, esophageal, kidney, stomach and liver cancers; HR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65). Men with advanced periodontitis had an HR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.56-4.21; P = 0.0002) for smoking-related cancers, compared with men who did not have periodontitis and had 17 teeth or more. Advanced periodontitis was associated with elevated risks of esophageal and head and neck cancers (HR = 6.29, 95% CI 2.13-18.6; based on five cases with advanced periodontitis) and bladder cancer (HR = 5.06, 95% CI 2.32-11.0; based on nine cases with advanced periodontitis).

Design, setting and participants:   From a cohort of 755 men who underwent transperineal MRI and transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy under general anesthesia between 2012 and 2014, we retrospectively analyzed 120 consecutive patients who had subsequent RP. All received saturation biopsy (SB) in addition to FTB of lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥2.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The index lesion was defined as the lesion with extraprostatic extension, the highest Gleason score (GS), or the largest tumor volume (TV) if GS were the same, in order of priority. GS 3+3 and TV ≥1.3ml or GS ≥3+4 and TV ≥0.55ml were considered sPCa. We assessed the detection accuracy by mpMRI and different biopsy approaches and analyzed lesion agreement between mpMRI and RP specimen.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 120 index and 71 nonindex lesions were detected. Overall, 107 (89%) index and 51 (72%) nonindex lesions harbored sPCa. MpMRI detected 110 of 120 (92%) index lesions, FTB (two cores per lesion) alone diagnosed 96 of 120 (80%) index lesions, and SB alone diagnosed 110 of 120 (92%) index lesions. Combined SB and FTB detected 115 of 120 (96%) index foci. FTB performed significantly less accurately compared with mpMRI (p=0.02) and the combination for index lesion detection (p=0.002). Combined FTB and SB detected 97% of all sPCa lesions and was superior to mpMRI (85%), FTB (79%), and SB (88%) alone (p<0.001 each). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for index lesion agreement between mpMRI and RP was 0.87 (p<0.001). Limitations included the retrospective design, multiple operators, and nonblinding of radiologists.  Conclusions:   MpMRI identified 92% of index lesions compared with RP histopathology. The combination of FTB and SB was superior to both approaches alone, reliably detecting 97% of sPCa lesions.

Moreover, the present wide application of prostate biopsy to increase prostate cancer detection rate might cause unnecessary and excessive examination or treatment. Therefore, a risk assessment model for forecasting GS ≥ 7 in potential prostate cancer patients was established to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.  Methods:   Patients (n = 981; September 2009 to January 2013) who underwent trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided core prostate biopsy were retrospectively evaluated in the first stage of the study. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA (fPSA), the free/total PSA ratio (f/t), prostate volume (PV), PSA density (PSAD), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings (texture, nodules) and B-ultrasound detection results (normal or abnormal, presence of hypoechoic mass or microcalcification) were considered as potential predictive factors. After multiple logistic regression analysis, independent variables used to build a nomogram were selected using a backward elimination selection procedure. Then, a model to forecast GS ≥ 7 was designed for potential prostate cancer patients. In the second stage of the study, 410 cases (January 2013 to March 2015) were subsequently evaluated using our model for prostate biopsies, and the outcomes of biopsies were compared between the two stages.  Results:   PSA, DRE texture, DRE nodules and B-ultrasound results were finally brought into our nomogram; a obviously greater area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained for the model than utilizing PSA, fPSA or PSAD alone (0.831 vs. 0.803, 0.770, 0.780 separately). We thereafter sought the best cutoff value in the ROC curve at 0.87, which provided sensitivity as high as 90%. Meanwhile, the specificity was 45.8%, which was much higher than the specificity of PSA, fPSA and PSAD at the same sensitivity level (37.7, 24.6 and 35.2%, respectively). In the first stage, the detection rate of GS ≥ 7 in the high-risk group was significantly higher than in the low-risk group (80.3 vs. 35.0%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, in the second stage, with the application of the new model associated with our former models, the rate of GS ≥ 7 was improved from 71.0 (697/981) to 79.2% (267/337) (p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   The model for forecasting GS ≥ 7 is effective, which could reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies without delaying patients' diagnoses and treatments.""","""['Xiao Li', 'Yongsheng Pan', 'Yuan Huang', 'Jun Wang', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Jie Wu', 'Gong Cheng', 'Chao Qin', 'Lixin Hua', 'Zengjun Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Developing a follow-up strategy for patients with PSA ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml via a new model to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.', 'Developing a nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for forecasting high-grade prostate cancer to reduce unnecessary biopsies within the prostate-specific antigen gray zone.', 'Clinical usefulness of free PSA in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer in the elderly.', 'Integration of magnetic resonance imaging into prostate cancer nomograms.', 'Construction and Validation of a Clinical Predictive Nomogram for Improving the Cancer Detection of Prostate Naive Biopsy Based on Chinese Multicenter Clinical Data.', 'A novel robust nomogram based on peripheral monocyte counts for predicting lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound can reduce collection of unnecessary biopsies when diagnosing prostate cancer and is predictive of biochemical recurrence following a radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'The prediction value of PI-RADS v2 score in high-grade Prostate Cancer: a multicenter retrospective study.']"""

Results:   Patients with higher Gleason score on biopsy and RP, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis, and positive surgical margins status had a significantly elevated preoperative CRP compared to those without these features. Patients with elevated CRP had a lower 5-year BCR survival proportion as compared to those with normal CRP (55% vs 76%, respectively, P<0.0001). In pre- and postoperative multivariable models that adjusted for standard clinical and pathologic features, elevated CRP was independently associated with BCR (P<0.001).

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have long been considered ""housekeeping"" genes with no relevance for cancer biology. Emerging evidence has challenged this assumption, suggesting that snoRNA expression is frequently modulated during cancer progression. Despite this, no study has systematically addressed the prognostic and functional significance of snoRNAs in PCa. We performed RNA Sequencing on paired metastatic/non-metastatic PCa xenografts derived from clinical specimens. The clinical significance of differentially expressed snoRNAs was further investigated in two independent primary PCa cohorts (131 and 43 patients, respectively). The snoRNA demonstrating the strongest association with clinical outcome was quantified in PCa patient-derived serum samples and its functional relevance was investigated in PCa cells via gene expression profiling, pathway analysis and gene silencing. Our comparison revealed 21 differentially expressed snoRNAs in the metastatic vs. non-metastatic xenografts. Of those, 12 were represented in clinical databases and were further analyzed. SNORA55 emerged as a predictor of shorter relapse-free survival (results confirmed in two independent databases). SNORA55 was reproducibly detectable in serum samples from PCa patients. SNORA55 silencing in PCa cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Pathway analysis revealed that SNORA55 expression is significantly associated with growth factor signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in PCa.

Epidemiologic evidence linking dyslipidemia, an established cardiovascular risk factor, and prostate cancer progression is mixed. As existing studies were conducted in predominantly non-black populations, research on black men is lacking.  Methods:   We identified 628 black and 1,020 non-black men who underwent radical prostatectomy and never used statins before surgery in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. Median follow-up was 2.9 years. The impact of preoperative hypercholesterolemia on risk of biochemical recurrence was examined using multivariable, race-stratified proportional hazards. In secondary analysis, we examined associations with low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides, overall and among men with dyslipidemia.  Results:   High cholesterol was associated with increased risk of recurrence in black [HR(per10 mg/dL) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.11] but not non-black men (HR(per10 mg/dL) 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03; P(interaction) = 0.011).

There were no significant associations between LDL or HDL and recurrence risk in either race. Associations with cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were similar among men with dyslipidemia, but low HDL was associated with increased risk of recurrence in black, but not non-black men with dyslipidemia (P(interaction) = 0.047).

Methods:   We examined prediagnostic serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and prostate cancer survival in a cohort of 1,000 cases in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. During 23 years of follow-up, 363 men died from their disease. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of death from prostate cancer by season-specific quintile of 25(OH)D. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, physical activity, cigarettes per day, and family history of prostate cancer.  Results:   Men with higher serum 25(OH)D were less likely to die from their prostate cancer (Q5 vs. Q1 HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; Ptrend = 0.006).

Materials and methods:   Fifty-seven patients with available biopsy specimens were identified from a cohort of 169 men treated with radical prostatectomy in a previously reported Decipher validation study at Cleveland Clinic. A Cox multivariable proportional hazards model and survival C-index were used to evaluate the performance of Decipher.  Results:   With a median follow up of 8 years, 8 patients metastasized and 3 died of prostate cancer. The Decipher plus National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) model had an improved C-index of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.96) compared to NCCN alone (C-index 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87). On multivariable analysis, Decipher was the only significant predictor of metastasis when adjusting for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen and biopsy Gleason score (Decipher hazard ratio per 10% increase 1.72, 95% CI 1.07-2.81, P = .02).  Conclusion:   Biopsy Decipher predicted the risk of metastasis at 10 years post radical prostatectomy.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1, whose expression is promoted by Androgen Receptor (AR), protects AR from microRNA-mediated suppression in PCa cells. PlncRNA-1 knockdown resulted in the up-regulation of a series of AR-targeting microRNAs, among which miR-34c and miR-297 were found to regulate both AR and PlncRNA-1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Functional analysis revealed that miR-34c and miR-297 overexpression down-regulated AR expression and inhibited the expression of downstream AR targets and that PlncRNA-1 overexpression rescued these effects. The association of PlncRNA-1 with tumor progression was also evaluated in mouse xenograft models, PCa tissues (16 paired samples), and blood samples (35 biopsy-negative and 37 biopsy-positive). Together, the data generated in this study indicate that PlncRNA-1 sponges AR-targeting microRNAs to protect AR from microRNA-mediated down-regulation and that these events form a regulatory feed-forward loop in the development of PCa. These findings suggest that PlncRNA-1 might potentially serve as a novel biomarker in PCa and that PlncRNA-1 might warrant further investigation to determine its potential role as a promising therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Ziyu Fang', 'Chen Xu', 'Yaoming Li', 'Xiaobing Cai', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Houqi Liu', 'Yue Wang', 'Fubo Wang', 'Rui Chen', 'Min Qu', 'Yang Wang', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Wei Zhang', 'Xiaolei Shi', 'Jingjing Yao', 'Xu Gao', 'Jianguo Hou', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['The prostate cancer-up-regulated long noncoding RNA PlncRNA-1 modulates apoptosis and proliferation through reciprocal regulation of androgen receptor.', 'Regulation and methylation of tumor suppressor miR-124 by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Brevilin A shows an anti-tumor role in prostate cancer via the lncRNA H19/miR-194/E2F3 signaling pathway.', 'The Role and Mechanism of Long Non-Coding RNA HOTAIR in the Oncogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

Our cell proliferation studies showed that both PC-3 and DU145 cells were more sensitive to PB, though all the compounds induced mitochondrial potential loss, DNA fragmentation and morphological changes which are indicative of apoptosis. Both BRCA1/2 siRNA transfected PC-3 and DU145 cells exhibited increased sensitivity to PB. Gene expression profiling post PB treatment in BRCA1/2 silenced cells revealed that PB has a putative role in tumor suppression in BRCA defective cancers. Using flow cytometric analysis we have proved that PB has the putative ability to directly target CSCs.

We also identified predictors of prognosis in the entire cohort.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 117 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer at our institution from 1990 to 2012. The cohort was divided into group 1 of 61 patients treated only with bacillus Calmette-Guérin with or without interferon-α and group 2 of 56 who received at least 1 additional salvage intravesical chemotherapy after bacillus Calmette-Guérin.  Results:   Final pathology and survival outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups. Five-year overall and cancer specific survival was similar in groups 1 and 2 at 80% and 85%, respectively, at approximately equivalent followups. Median bladder retention was 1.7 years longer in group 2 (p <0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis delayed cystectomy in group 2 did not convey a significant hazard for all cause mortality after cystectomy (HR 1.08, p = 0.808).

We herein evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy for the primary tumor in prostate cancer with metastasis.  Materials/methods:   The study cohort included 140 men with metastatic prostate cancer at initial diagnosis. Metastatic sites were divided into 4 groups as follows: solitary bone, 2-4 bones, ≥5 bones, and visceral organs. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients treated with (prostate radiotherapy [PRT] group) or without radiotherapy to the primary tumor.  Results:   Patients in PRT group presented with a statistically significantly younger age (p = .02), whereas other characteristics showed no significant difference. Overall survival (OS) and biochemical failure-free survival (BCFFS) were improved in PRT patients (3-year OS: 69% vs. 43%, p = 0.004; 3-year BCFFS: 52% vs. 16%, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis identified PRT as a significant predictor of both OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, p = 0.015). None of the 38 PRT patients experienced severe (grade ≥3) genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity.

Circadian genes are highly expressed in the ovaries where they regulate ovulation; circadian disruption is associated with several ovarian cancer risk factors (e.g., endometriosis). However, no studies have examined variation in germline circadian genes as predictors of ovarian cancer risk and invasiveness. The goal of the current study was to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in circadian genes BMAL1, CRY2, CSNK1E, NPAS2, PER3, REV1 and TIMELESS and downstream transcription factors KLF10 and SENP3 as predictors of risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and histopathologic subtypes. The study included a test set of 3,761 EOC cases and 2,722 controls and a validation set of 44,308 samples including 18,174 (10,316 serous) cases and 26,134 controls from 43 studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Analysis of genotype data from 36 genotyped SNPs and 4600 imputed SNPs indicated that the most significant association was rs117104877 in BMAL1 (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.68-0.90, p = 5.59 × 10-4]. Functional analysis revealed a significant down regulation of BMAL1 expression following cMYC overexpression and increasing transformation in ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells as well as alternative splicing of BMAL1 exons in ovarian and granulosa cells.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed on 34 malignant and 18 normal colon tissue specimens. The specimens were obtained from 19 male and 15 female patients, with a mean age of 52 years (range, 34-79 years). Of the 34 patients, 20 had lymph node metastases. None of the patients had received adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery. This study demonstrated that CXCR7 levels were significantly higher in colon tumors compared with those in normal colon tissue (P﹤0.01). In addition, lymph node metastatic colon tumors exhibited significantly higher CXCR7 expression compared with non-metastatic tumors (P﹤0.01); however, there were no differences in CXCR7 expression among distinct histopathological types (well-differentiated vs. moderately-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, P﹥0.01).

Methods:   The DNA was extracted from homogeneous cells captured by laser capture microdissection in 20 prostate cancer and 18 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues for scanning the CpG islands using RLGS. The methylation status of each CpG island was compared between the cancer and BPH samples to screen the genes involved in prostate cancer development. The screened genes were uploaded to DAVID database for GO analysis, and the genes with the most significant methylation were analyzed by pyrosequencing.  Results and conclusion:   Among all the tested CpG islands, 10245 (37.2%) in prostate cancer and 8658 (30.3%) in BPH samples were found to be abnormally methylated, and >60% of the methylated CpG islands were in the promoter region. Compared with BPH samples, the prostate cancer samples showed differential methyation in 735 CpG islands, including 458 hepermethyated and 256 hypomethelated ones. Seven genes (DPYS, P16, APC, GSTP1, TMEM122, RARB, and ARHGAP20) in prostate cancer were identified to have distinct methylations.

Identifying these men would allow them to undergo systemic therapy including testing novel therapies to reduce metastases risk.  Objective:   To test whether the genomic classifier (GC) predicts development of metastatic disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective multi-center and multi-ethnic cohort study from two academic centers and one Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the United States involving 170 men receiving SRT for recurrent PCa post-RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Time from SRT to development of metastatic disease tested using Cox regression, survival c-index, and decision curve analysis. Performance of GC was compared to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Score and Briganti risk models based on these metrics.  Results and limitations:   With a median 5.7 yr follow-up after SRT, 20 patients (12%) developed metastases. On multivariable analysis, for each 0.1 unit increase in GC (scaled from 0 to 1), the hazard ratio for metastasis was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.16-2.17; p=0.002). Adjusting for androgen deprivation therapy did not materially change the results. The c-index for GC was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.88) versus 0.63-0.65 for published clinico-pathologic risk models. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of metastasis post-SRT in patients with low, intermediate, and high GC scores was 2.7%, 8.4%, and 33.1%, respectively (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   While validation in larger, prospectively collected cohorts is required, these data suggest GC is a strong predictor of metastases among men receiving SRT for recurrent PCa post-RP, accurately identifying men who are excellent candidates for systemic therapy due to their very high-risk of metastases.

Tumor cell-derived CCL2 was shown to promote the recruitment of CCR2(+)/Ly6C(hi) monocytes and to induce vascular permeability of CCR2(+) endothelial cells in the lungs. Here we describe a novel decoy protein consisting of a CCL2 mutant protein fused to human serum albumin (dnCCL2-HSA chimera) with enhanced binding affinity to glycosaminoglycans that was tested in vivo. The monocyte-mediated tumor cell transendothelial migration was strongly reduced upon unfused dnCCL2 mutant treatment in vitro. dnCCL2-HSA chimera had an extended serum half-life and thus a prolonged exposure in vivo compared with the dnCCL2 mutant. dnCCL2-HSA chimera bound to the lung vasculature but caused minimal alterations in the leukocyte recruitment to the lungs. However, dnCCL2-HSA chimera treatment strongly reduced both lung vascular permeability and tumor cell seeding. Metastasis of MC-38GFP, 3LL, and LLC1 cells was significantly attenuated upon dnCCL2-HSA chimera treatment. Tumor cell seeding to the lungs resulted in enhanced expression of a proteoglycan syndecan-4 by endothelial cells that correlated with accumulation of the dnCCL2-HSA chimera in the vicinity of tumor cells. These findings demonstrate that the CCL2-based decoy protein effectively binds to the activated endothelium in lungs and blocks tumor cell extravasation through inhibition of vascular permeability.""","""['Marko Roblek', 'Elisabeth Strutzmann', 'Christina Zankl', 'Tiziana Adage', 'Mathias Heikenwalder', 'Aid Atlic', 'Roland Weis', 'Andreas Kungl', 'Lubor Borsig']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['CCL2 Is a Vascular Permeability Factor Inducing CCR2-Dependent Endothelial Retraction during Lung Metastasis.', 'Targeted delivery of CCR2 antagonist to activated pulmonary endothelium prevents metastasis.', 'CCL2 recruits inflammatory monocytes to facilitate breast-tumour metastasis.', 'Targeting the CCL2-CCR2 signaling axis in cancer metastasis.', 'Role of the CCL2-CCR2 signalling axis in cancer: Mechanisms and therapeutic targeting.', 'Investigating Chemokine-Matrix Networks in Breast Cancer: Tenascin-C Sets the Tone for CCL2.', 'Chronic inflammation, cancer development and immunotherapy.', 'Comparing the Cytokine Storms of COVID-19 and Pandemic Influenza.', 'Rethinking the chemokine cascade in brain metastasis: Preventive and therapeutic implications.', 'CCL2 in the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

As previous work supports negative regulation of MET by AR signaling, we hypothesized that intact AR signaling may have limited the efficacy of cabozantinib in some of these patients. To assess the role of AR signaling on MET inhibition, we first performed an in silico analysis of human CRPC tissue samples stratified by AR signaling status ((+) or (-)), which identified MET expression as markedly increased in AR(-) samples. In vitro, AR signaling inhibition in AR(+) CRPC models increased MET expression and resulted in susceptibility to ligand (HGF) activation. Likewise, MET inhibition was only effective in blocking cancer phenotypes in cells with MET overexpression. Using multiple AR(+) CRPC in vitro and in vivo models, we showed that combined cabozantinib and enzalutamide (AR antagonist) treatment was more efficacious than either inhibitor alone. These data provide a compelling rationale to combine AR and MET inhibition in CRPC and may explain the negative results of the phase III cabozantinib study in CRPC.

Patients and methods:   The analysis included 273 patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT for rising prostate-specific antigen level after surgery or radiotherapy. Patients were assessed for the presence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity before commencing ADT, and Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to assess the presence of the composite diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. A competing risks regression model was used to assess associations of time to PCSD with the metabolic conditions, while a multivariable Cox regression model was used to assess associations of OS with metabolic syndrome and metabolic conditions.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 11.6 years, 157 patients (58%) died, of whom 58 (21%) died from prostate cancer. At the start of ADT the median (range) patient age was 74 (46-92) years and the median PSA level was 3.0 ng/mL. Metabolic syndrome was observed in 31% of patients; hypertension (68%) and dyslipidaemia (47%) were the most common metabolic conditions. No association of PCSD and metabolic syndrome status was observed. Patients with hypertension tended to have a higher cumulative incidence of PCSD than those without hypertension (sub-distribution hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89, 2.84; P = 0.11) although the difference was not statistically significant.

However, the mechanism(s) behind the effect of antioxidants in cancer is still unclear. Previous studies indicate that supplements can influence gene expression; however, all of these studies were focused on the coding/exonic gene expression. Studies are now emerging to highlight critical functional roles for RNAs expressed from the non-coding regions. This project was designed to study the effect of antioxidant supplements on non-coding intronic RNA expression in human cancers. Vitamin E, N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Sulforaphane are commonly used supplements to prevent diseases including cancers. We studied the effect of these antioxidant supplements on the non-coding intronic RNA expression using publicly available datasets from a mouse model for lung cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. Although high throughput polyA-enriched RNA-Seq data characterize spliced coding mRNA regions, recent studies reveal the expression of reads from the non-coding intronic regions. Our analyses indicate that cancer cells have higher expression of introns compared to that of normal cells and that treatment with antioxidant supplements reduces the increased expression of introns of several genes. However, we did find high expression of introns of multiple genes including many oncogenes in the supplement treated groups compared to that of the control; this effect was distinct depending on the cell type and the supplement studied. Using RT-PCRs, we validated the expression of introns of two oncogenes, DLK1 and LRG1, known to be key players in lung cancer progression, and demonstrate changed intronic expression with supplement treatment in cancer cells. With regard to the antioxidant system, supplements did not change the intronic RNAs for endogenous antioxidant enzymes except for a significant decrease in the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) intronic RNA. Concurrently, we also found that a prolonged (48 h) exposure to Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Green tea extract reduced the enzymatic activity of SOD in lung cancer cells. The results from this study reveal that the antioxidant supplements have a significant effect on the intronic RNA expression of many genes including cancer genes that are not directly linked to the body's antioxidant system. It is important to study this novel effect of antioxidant supplements in detail as it may have a significant role in disease progression.""","""['Shreya Menon', 'Chunxia Lu', 'Rajasree Menon', 'Jessica Schwartz', 'Yuanfang Guan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Antioxidants (Basel)""","""['Genome mapping and expression analyses of human intronic noncoding RNAs reveal tissue-specific patterns and enrichment in genes related to regulation of transcription.', 'Androgen responsive intronic non-coding RNAs.', 'Intronic RNAs constitute the major fraction of the non-coding RNA in mammalian cells.', 'Antioxidant supplements for preventing gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Antioxidant supplements for preventing gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Relationships between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer: biological insights.', 'Post-transcriptional regulation of photosynthetic genes is a key driver of C4 leaf ontogeny.']"""

Adenocarcinoma was detected in the biopsy specimen. MRI and CT examination showed a huge papillary tumor of the bladder invading the inner lobe of the prostate. In addition, the wall of the lower rectum exhibited thickening with enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. Endoscopy disclosed a hemi-circular rectal tumor and pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma, the profile of which was similar to the bladder tumor. The levels of CEA and CA19-9 were 5.3 ng/mL and 39 U/mL, respectively. A differential diagnosis considering bladder cancer, rectal cancer, or both was necessary before planning a treatment strategy.

This retrospective study evaluated pT4b colorectal cancer in terms of the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery.  Methods and results:   Forty-six cases with pT4b colorectal cancer that occurred between 2006 and 2014 were investigated. Laparoscopic surgery (LAC) was performed in 20 cases, of which 5 were conversions, and open surgery (OC) was performed in 26 cases. Pathologically-proven invaded organs resected by LAC were the abdominal wall (n=6), greater omentum (n=5), small intestine or colon (n=3), bladder, appendix, or ovary (n=1). Organs resected by OC were the abdominal wall (n=8), bladder (n=5), colon, greater omentum, or small intestine (n=3), stomach, ovary, spermatic duct (concurrent with bladder), prostate, or sacrum (n=1). Operation time (median) was 275 min for LAC and 260 min for OC. Blood loss (median) was 100 mL for LAC and 410 mL for OC. The duration of hospital stay (median) was 15 days after LAC and 18 days after OC. There were 2 cases with morbidities greater than Grade 3 after LAC and 1 case after OC.

We evaluated the relationship of expression profiles of ERβ subtypes and the ER GPR30 (G-protein-coupled receptor-30) with patient factors at diagnosis and outcomes following radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Tissue microarrays constructed using samples from 566 men with long-term clinical followup were analyzed by immunohistochemistry targeting ERβ1, ERβ2, ERβ5 and GPR30. An experienced pathologist scored receptor distribution and staining intensity. Tumor staining characteristics were evaluated for associations with patient characteristics, recurrence-free survival and prostate cancer specific mortality following radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells had unique receptor subtype staining patterns. ERβ1 demonstrated predominantly nuclear localization while ERβ2, ERβ5 and GPR30 were predominantly cytoplasmic. After controlling for patient factors intense cytoplasmic ERβ1 staining was independently associated with time to recurrence (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6, p = 0.01) and prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 6.6, 95% CI 1.8-24.9, p = 0.01). Intense nuclear ERβ2 staining was similarly independently associated with prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.4, p = 0.03). Patients with cytoplasmic ERβ1 and nuclear ERβ2 co-staining had significantly worse 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality than patients with expression of only cytoplasmic ERβ1, only nuclear ERβ2 and neither ER (16.4%, 4.3%, 0.0% and 2.0 %, respectively, p = 0.001).

We studied disease-specific survival by 5-ARI usage in a cohort of 6,537 prostate cancer cases diagnosed in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial and linked to the national prescription database for information on medication use. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for prostate cancer-specific deaths.

Mathematical modeling is a promising approach for longitudinal analysis of tumor marker kinetics.  Patients and methods:   The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increases from patients with PCa and those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were retrospectively analyzed using a mathematical model. Using the NONMEM program, individual PSA kinetics were fit to the following equation: [d(PSA)/dt = (PROD.K × exp [RHO1 × t]) × (1 - BPH) + PROD.NK × exp (RHO2 × t) - KELIM × (PSA)], where RHO1 is the PSA production increase rate by PCa cells (PROD.K), RHO2 is the PSA production increase rate by non-PCa cells (PROD.NK), and KELIM is the PSA elimination rate. The comparative value of the modeled kinetic parameters, estimated for each patient, for predicting the D'Amico score and relapse-free survival (RFS) were tested using logistic regression analysis and multivariate survival tests.  Results:   The PSA kinetics from 62 patients with BPH and 149 patients with PCa before radical prostatectomy were successfully modeled. We identified statistically significant relationships between the PSA growth rate related to cancer cells (RHO1) and the probability of D'Amico high-risk group (less than the median RHO1 vs. at the median or greater: odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-4.77; P = .05). RHO1 was also a significant prognostic factor for RFS on univariate analysis and against other reported prognostic factors using multivariate Cox tests. Three independent prognostic factors of RFS were found: RHO1 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.25-5.84; P = .01), Gleason score (HR, 8.54; 95% CI, 4.19-17.40; P < .01), and positive surgical margins (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.05-3.97; P = .03).

Here we show that orthotopic implantation of rat prostate AT-1 tumour cells increased LOX and LOXLs mRNA expressions in the tumour and in the surrounding non-malignant prostate tissue. Inhibition of LOX enzymes, using Beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), initiated before implantation of AT-1 cells, reduced tumour growth. Conversely, treatment that was started after the tumours were established resulted in unaffected or increased tumour growth. Moreover, treatment with BAPN did not suppress the formation of spontaneous lymph node metastases, or lung tumour burden, when tumour cells were injected intravenously. A temporal decrease in collagen fibre content, which is a target for LOX, was observed in tumours and in the tumour-adjacent prostate tissue. This may explain why early BAPN treatment is more effective in inhibiting tumour growth compared to treatment initiated later. Our data suggest that the enzymatic function of the LOX family is context-dependent, with both tumour-suppressing and tumour-promoting properties in prostate cancer.

In this study, we identified a critical nexus between p38MAPK signaling, and the transcription factor Forkhead Box Protein C2 (FOXC2) known to promote cancer stem-cells and metastasis. We demonstrate that prostate cancer cells that are insensitive to ADT, as well as high-grade/NE prostate tumors, are characterized by elevated FOXC2, and that targeting FOXC2 using a well-tolerated p38 inhibitor restores epithelial attributes and ADT-sensitivity, and reduces the shedding of circulating tumor cells in vivo with significant shrinkage in the tumor mass.

Androgenic effects of HBCD and NP were examined in LNCaP prostate cancer cells expressing androgen receptors (ARs). HBCD and NP increased LNCaP cell viability similar to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by MTT assay. This phenomenon was reversed by treatment with Casodex, an AR antagonist, suggesting that they act as xenoandrogens via AR signaling pathway. In cell migration assay, HBCD and NP also enhanced LNCaP cell migration similar to DHT. To elucidate underlying mechanisms of their actions on LNCaP, transcriptional levels of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related markers, including cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27, bcl-2, and bax, were determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. An increase in expression cyclin D1 and cyclin E and reduction in p27 and bax mRNA levels were observed by their treatments.

The expressions of TRPC1, TRPC4, Orai1, STIM1, and the androgen receptor and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing samples of normal prostate tissues (n=91), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n=61), CLC surgically treated (n=238), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; n=45). All markers significantly increased in CLC compared with normal tissues and (for Orai1 and STIM1) in advanced pT3 tumors compared with pT2. In contrast, their expression decreased in CRPC, particularly for Orai1. In CLC, staining for TRPC1, Orai1 and STIM1 correlated with androgen receptor expression, and TRPC1 status was associated with lower proliferation and longer recurrence-free survival, after adjusting for classical prognostic markers. Although increased SOC expression during PCa progression supports a role in cancer cell migration, the inverse association between TRPC1 and biochemical relapse suggests a protective effect in CLC. Moreover, the dramatic down-regulation of Orai1 in CRPC supports its role in apoptosis at this stage of the disease.

Although there has been increased attention regarding biopsy sampling of the distal apex to guide the performing of the apical dissection on radical prostatectomy, the finding of skeletal muscle involvement by prostatic adenocarcinoma has not been consistently reported by pathologists on biopsies. We searched our database spanning 12 years from 2000 to 2012 for all patients who had prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 involving skeletal muscle on biopsy. We identified 220 patients who met the criteria. Of the 220 patients, 101 underwent prostatectomy, which comprised the ""study group."" Prostatectomy reports from these patients were compared with those of a ""control group,"" which consisted of 201 contemporaneous patients with Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy without skeletal muscle involvement. The results showed a significantly higher percentage of positive margins in the study group compared with the control group (P = .006). The study group also had a higher percentage of positive margins at the apex admixed with skeletal muscle (P = .008). In summary, the findings in this study support that pathologists should report the involvement of skeletal muscle by tumor, and recommend that urologists performing radical prostatectomies on these patients try to ensure adequate excision in the apical area to avoid positive apical margin.""","""['Evita T Sadimin', 'Huihui Ye', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Skeletal muscle involvement by limited Gleason score 6 adenocarcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy is not associated with adverse findings at radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy: the value of preoperative, individually labeled apical biopsies.', 'Should intervening benign tissue be included in the measurement of discontinuous foci of cancer on prostate needle biopsy?

The transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3 are frequently activated in advanced prostate cancer and sustain expansion of prostate CSCs. EC-70124 is a novel chimeric indolocarbazole compound generated by metabolic engineering of the biosynthetic pathways of glycosylated indolocarbazoles, such as staurosporine and rebeccamycin. In vitro kinome analyses revealed that EC-70124 acted as a multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against IKKβ and JAK2. In this study, we show that EC-70124 blocked concomitantly NF-κB and STAT3 in prostate cancer cells and particularly prostate CSCs, which exhibited overactivation of these transcription factors. Phosphorylation of IkB and STAT3 (Tyr705), the immediate targets of IKKβ and JAK2, respectively, was rapidly inhibited in vitro by EC-70124 at concentrations that were well below plasma levels in mice. Furthermore, the drug blocked activation of NF-κB and STAT3 reporters and suppressed transcription of their target genes. Treatment with EC-70124 impaired proliferation and colony formation in vitro and delayed development of prostate tumor xenografts. Notably, EC-70124 had profound effects on the prostate CSC subpopulation both in vitro and in vivo Thus, EC-70124 is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways and blocked tumor growth and maintenance of prostate CSCs. EC-70124 may provide the basis for developing new therapeutic strategies that combine agents directed to the CSC component and the bulk tumor cell population for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   The National Cancer Data Base was queried for cN0M0 intermediate-risk patients treated from 2004 to 2006, with available data for Gleason score (GS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor stage, and receipt of radiation therapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy. RT comparison groups were the following: EBRT (40-50.4 Gy) plus brachytherapy and brachytherapy alone.  Results:   A total of 10,571 patients were included: 3,148 received EBRT plus brachytherapy and 7,423 received brachytherapy alone. Median followup was 84 months (2-122 months); median age was 68 years (40-90 years). Unadjusted 5- and 7-year overall survival (OS) rates between EBRT plus brachytherapy vs. brachytherapy alone were 91.4% vs. 90.2% and 85.7% vs. 82.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). EBRT plus brachytherapy was associated with longer OS compared with brachytherapy alone under multivariate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.93; p = 0.001) and propensity score-matched analyses (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97; p = 0.006). Further subset analysis performed based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0232 inclusion criteria (GS 7 if PSA < 10 or GS < 7 if PSA 10-20) also demonstrated longer OS with EBRT plus brachytherapy (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; p = 0.026).  Conclusions:   EBRT plus brachytherapy is associated with a modest OS improvement compared with brachytherapy alone in this population-based analysis. Although this benefit appears statistically significant, the relatively small difference in OS raises the question of overall clinical benefit with combined modality RT for intermediate-risk prostate cancer, given the potential increased risk for toxicities.

However, the patient receives exposure that is more direct and, in surgery about the pelvis and hip, internal pelvic nonskeletal organs often cannot be shielded without obscuring the region of surgical interest. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate patients' radiation exposure during fracture surgery of the acetabulum, pelvic ring, and femur to calculate future cancer incidence (CI).  Design:   Prospective descriptive cohort.  Setting:   Level-1 trauma center.  Patients/participants:   One hundred eight patients with acetabulum, pelvic, or femur fractures requiring operative repair were prospectively enrolled.  Intervention:   Dosimeters were placed in locations determined for each surgery type by a medical physicist.  Main outcome measurements:   Demographics, operative records, and average x-ray emission energy were recorded. Effective dose, specific organ doses, and lifetime CI for a 30-year-old patient were calculated.  Results:   Diagnoses included 27 acetabular fractures, 30 intertrochanteric femur fractures, 26 femoral shafts, and 25 pelvic ring injuries. Patients with pelvic ring injuries received the highest effective dose at 0.91 ± 0.74 mSv. The average lifetime increase in CI, for any cancer type, after pelvic ring fixation is 0.0097% for females and 0.0062% for males. The greatest mean single-organ dose to the ovaries (3.82 ± 3.34 mGy) occurred during pelvic ring surgery, correlating to an increased ovarian cancer risk of 0.0013%. The greatest mean single-organ dose to the prostate (6.81 ± 5.91 mSv) also occurred during pelvic surgery, correlating to increased prostate cancer risk of 0.0024%.  Conclusions:   Fracture surgery to the pelvis and femur is exceptionally fluoroscopy-dependent; however, the radiation exposure incurred represents a relatively small increased risk of future cancer development in patients.

Its potential as a therapeutic target is well recognized, but inhibitors of FASN have not yet been approved for cancer therapy. Orlistat (ORL), an FDA-approved lipase inhibitor, is also an effective inhibitor of FASN. However, ORL is extremely hydrophobic and has low systemic uptake after oral administration. Thus, new strategies are required to formulate ORL for cancer treatment as a FASN inhibitor. Here, we report the development of a nanoparticle (NP) formulation of ORL using amphiphilic bioconjugates that are derived from hyaluronic acid (HA), termed Nano-ORL. The NPs were loaded with up to 20 wt % weight of ORL at greater than 95% efficiency. The direct inhibition of the human recombinant thioesterase domain of FASN by ORL extracted from Nano-ORL was similar to that of stock ORL. Nano-ORL demonstrated a similar ability to inhibit cellular FASN activity when compared to free ORL, as demonstrated by analysis of (14)C-acetate incorporation into lipids. Nano-ORL treatment also disrupted mitochondrial function similarly to ORL by reducing adenosine triphosphate turnover in MDA-MB-231 and LNCaP cells. Nano-ORL demonstrated increased potency compared to ORL toward prostate and breast cancer cells. Nano-ORL decreased viability of human prostate and breast cancer cell lines to 55 and 57%, respectively, while free ORL decreased viability to 71 and 79% in the same cell lines. Moreover, Nano-ORL retained cytotoxic activity after a 24 h preincubation in aqueous conditions. Preincubation of ORL dramatically reduced the efficacy of ORL as indicated by high cell viability (>85%) in both breast and prostate cell lines. These data demonstrate that NP formulation of ORL using HA-derived polymers retains similar levels of FASN, lipid synthesis, and ATP turnover inhibition while significantly improving the cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.""","""['Tanner K Hill', 'Amanda L Davis', 'Frances B Wheeler', 'Sneha S Kelkar', 'Erica C Freund', 'W Todd Lowther', 'Steven J Kridel', 'Aaron M Mohs']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Overexpression of fatty acid synthase in human gliomas correlates with the WHO tumor grade and inhibition with Orlistat reduces cell viability and triggers apoptosis.', 'Fatty acid synthase is a key target in multiple essential tumor functions of prostate cancer: uptake of radiolabeled acetate as a predictor of the targeted therapy outcome.', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction is responsible for fatty acid synthase inhibition-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by PdpaMn.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase in breast and endometrial cancer: An alternative to selective estrogen receptor modulators?', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'Hyaluronic Acid within Self-Assembling Nanoparticles: Endless Possibilities for Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'Lipogenesis inhibitors: therapeutic opportunities and challenges.', 'Combination Therapy of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Hyaluronic Acid Decorated, Cabazitaxel-Prodrug and Orlistat Co-Loaded Nano-System.', 'ω-Hydroxy isoprenoid bisphosphonates as linkable GGDPS inhibitors.', 'Hyaluronic acid formulation of near infrared fluorophores optimizes surgical imaging in a prostate tumor xenograft.']"""

The effect of miR-129 on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro was also determined.  Results:   Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that the expression of miR-129 was dramatically down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for prostate cancer patients in comparison with healthy controls (P<0.05).

We aimed to describe kinetics and predictive value of PSA for PCa in HIV+ men.  Methods:   A nested case control study of 21 men with PCa and 40 matched-controls within EuroSIDA was conducted. Prospectively stored plasma samples before PCa (or matched date in controls) were measured for the following markers: total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Conditional logistic regression models investigated associations between markers and PCa. Mixed models were used to describe kinetics. Sensitivity and specificity of using tPSA >4 ng/ml to predict PCa was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify optimal cutoffs in HIV+ men for total PSA.  Results:   61 HIV+ men were included with a median 6 (IQR 2-9) years follow-up. Levels of tPSA increased by 13.7% per year (95% CI 10.3, 17.3) in cases, but was stable in controls (-0.4%; 95% CI -2.5, 1.7). Elevated PSA was associated with higher odds of PCa at first (OR for twofold higher 4.7; 95% CI 1.7, 12.9; P<0.01) and last sample (8.1; 95% CI 1.1, 58.9; P=0.04). A similar relationship was seen between fPSA and PCa. Testosterone and SHBG level were not associated with PCa. tPSA level >4 ng/ml had 99% specificity and 38% sensitivity. The optimal PSA cutoff was 1.5 ng/ml overall (specificity =84%, sensitivity =81%).

Patients and methods:   A matched-pair analysis was conducted. In all, 215 patients with Gleason score 6 or 7 (3 + 4) prostate cancer on biopsy who underwent RP before 31 December 2005 (pre-ISUP group), were matched 1:1 by biopsy Gleason score, clinical tumour category, PSA level, and margin status to patients undergoing RP between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011 (post-ISUP group). Patients were followed until BCR defined as a PSA level of ≥0.2 ng/mL. Risk of BCR was analysed in a competing-risk model.  Results:   The median follow-up was 9.5 years in the pre-ISUP group and 4.8 years in the post-ISUP group. The 5-year cumulative incidences of BCR were 34.0% and 13.9% in the pre-ISUP and post-ISUP groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The difference in cumulative incidence applied to both patients with Gleason score 6 (P < 0.001) and 7 (3 + 4) (P = 0.004). There was no difference in the 5-year cumulative incidence of BCR between patients with pre-ISUP Gleason score 6 and post-ISUP Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) (P = 0.34). In a multiple Cox-proportional hazard regression model, ISUP 2005 grading was a strong prognostic factor for BCR within 5 years of RP (hazard ratio 0.34; 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.54; P < 0.001).

Patients and methods:   A total of 132 patients who had biopsy-proven low grade (GS < 7) PCa, 3T DWI results, and surgical confirmation were retrospectively included in the study. Clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen, greatest percentage of cancer in a biopsy core and percentage of positive cores) and DWI variables (minimum apparent diffusion coefficient [ADCmin ] and mean ADC [ADCmean ]) were evaluated. ADCmin was measured, by two independent, blinded readers, using a region of interest (ROI) of 5-10 mm2 at the area of lowest ADC value within a cancer, while ADCmean was measured using an ROI covering more than half of a cancer.

Parametric maps were obtained for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2* values. Two radiologists reviewed these maps and measured ADC and T2* values in sextants positive for cancer at biopsy. Data were analysed using mixed-model analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic curves.  Results:   Ninety-three sextants exhibited a Gleason score of 6; 59 exhibited a Gleason score of 7 or 8. The T2* value was significantly lower in cancerous sextants than in the benign PZ (48.69+0.60 versus 74.14+0.56, p<0.001), as well as in cancerous sextants with higher rather than lower Gleason scores (43.18+0.89 versus 52.18+0.55, p<0.001).

Due to their multimodal effect on perturbation of cellular oxidative state, these compounds hold great potential as therapeutic agents against highly proliferative neoplastic cells. In our previous work, we developed a series of novel dimeric naphthoquinones and showed that they were selectively cytotoxic to human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast and prostate cancer cell lines. We subsequently identified the oxidoreductase NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1) as the major target of dimeric naphthoquinones and proposed a mechanism of action that entailed induction of a futile redox cycling.  Results:   Here, for the first time, we describe a direct physical interaction between the bromohydroxy dimeric naphthoquinone E6a and NQO1. Moreover, our studies reveal an extensive binding interface between E6a and the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor of NQO1 in addition to interactions with protein side chains in the active site. We also present biochemical evidence that dimeric naphthoquinones affect the redox state of the FAD cofactor of NQO1.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) maps metabolites in prostate cancer, providing information on tumor aggressiveness and volume.  Purpose:   To investigate the correlation between MRSI and treatment failure (TF) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Two-hundred sixty-two patients who underwent endorectal MRI/MRSI followed by RP at our institution from 2003 to 2007 were studied. MRI stage, number of voxels in the MRSI index lesion (NILV), number of high-grade voxels (NHGV), and number of voxels containing undetectable polyamines (NUPV) were derived. Clinical outcome was followed until August, 2014. Treatment failure was defined as 1) biochemical recurrence (BCR), 2) persistently detectable PSA after RP, or 3) adjuvant therapy initiated in the absence of BCR. MRI/MRSI features and clinical parameters were compared to TF by univariate Cox Proportional Hazards Regression. After backward selection, each MRSI parameter was included in a separate regression model adjusted for NCCN-based clinical risk score (CRS), number of biopsy cores positive (NPC), and MRI stage.  Results:   In univariate analysis, all clinical variables were associated with TF in addition to MRI stage, NILV, NHGV, and NUPV. In multivariate analysis, NILV, NHGV, and NUPV were also significant risk factors for TF (p=0.016, p=0.002, p=0.006, respectively). The association between the number of tumor voxels with undetectable polyamines and the probability of treatment failure has not been previously reported. The number of MRSI cancer voxels correlated with extracapsular extension (ECE) (p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   MRSI was associated with post-radical prostatectomy treatment failure in models adjusted for the number of positive biopsy cores and clinical risk score. This is the first report that in radical prostatectomy patients MRSI has an association with treatment failure independent of the number of positive biopsy cores. MRSI may help the clinician determine whether patients with high risk disease who undergo RP are candidates for specialized additional treatment.""","""['Kristen L Zakian', 'William Hatfield', 'Omer Aras', 'Kun Cao', 'Derya Yakar', 'Debra A Goldman', 'Chaya S Moskowitz', 'Amita Shukla-Dave', 'Yousef Mazaheri Tehrani', 'Samson Fine', 'James Eastham', 'Hedvig Hricak']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Preliminary assessment of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in predicting treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for relapse.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging Parameters to Predict Early Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The percentage of prostate needle biopsy cores with carcinoma from the more involved side of the biopsy as a predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging in the pre-treatment evaluation of prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous 18F-fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ex vivo metabolic fingerprinting identifies biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate-a basic tutorial.']"""

This original system combines Cell-SELEX, a process that exploits the cellular structure to generate specific ligands, and 3D cell culture, an approach that mimics the tissue microenvironment in vitro. In the first round of 3D Cell-SELEX, a negative selection against RWPE-1, non-tumor cell line, was performed to subtract non-tumor specific aptamers. The supernatant was used in eight additional rounds of selection, which were performed against PC-3 cell line. After nine selection cycles, eight PC-3 specific RNA aptamers were selected and sequenced. The aptamers presented sizes between 20 and 50 nucleotides-long, with low free energy (∆G<-13.6), which contributed for their spontaneous folding and high stability. Furthermore, our results showed the aptamer A4 as a specific ligand to prostate tumor cells, with dissociation constant in the nanomolar scale.

Vitatex Inc.'s functional cell separation technology, constructed as Vita-Assay™ (AG6W, AN6W, AR6W) culture plates, is based on the preferential adhesion of invasive rare blood cells of tissue origin to a tissue or tumor microenvironment mimic-the so-called cell adhesion matrix (CAM), which has a demonstrated ability to enrich viable CTCs from blood up to one-million fold.The CAM-scaffold allows for the functional capture and identification of invasive CTCs (iCTCs) including invasive tumor progenitor (TP) cells from cancer-patients' blood. CAM-captured CTCs are capable of ingesting the CAM (CAM+) itself. Green and red fluorescent versions of Vita-Assay™ (AG6W and AR6W) allow for direct visualization of CAM-uptake by cancer cells. Vita-Assay™ CAM-enrichment has allowed for sensitive multiplex flow cytometric and microscopic detection of iCTCs from patients with cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, pancreas, colorectum, and lung; it has also been successfully utilized for ex vivo drug-sensitivity testing of ovarian-cancer patient CTCs.

The glucosinolate-derived phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) has been widely documented to reduce the risk of prostate cancer by modulating multiple biologically relevant processes. Emerging evidence suggests that PEITC may exert its anti-cancer effects through epigenetic mechanisms including microRNAs. Altered levels of miRNA have been linked to tumor malignancy due to their capacity to regulate functional gene expression in carcinogenesis. Here, we assessed the effects of PEITC on miRNA expression which is related to PCa cell invasiveness.  Methods and results:   Utilizing oligonucleotide microarray first identified the most affected miRNAs in LNCaP cells after PEITC treatment. Several top altered miRNAs were further validated using quantitative PCR. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-194 suppressed PC3 cell invasion in matrigel-coated Transwell chambers. Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) was shown to be a direct target of miR-194. Downregulation of BMP1 by miR-194 or PEITC led to decreased expression of key oncogenic matrix metalloproteinases, MMP2 and MMP9. This in turn resulted in the suppression of tumor invasion.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that miR-194 downregulates the expression of oncogenic MMP2 and MMP9 by targeting BMP1, which suggests a potential new mechanistic target by which PEITC suppresses prostate cancer cell invasiveness.""","""['Chengyue Zhang', 'Limin Shu', 'Hyuck Kim', 'Tin Oo Khor', 'Renyi Wu', 'Wenji Li', 'Ah-Ng Tony Kong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits androgen receptor-regulated transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells through suppressing PCAF.', 'PEITC inhibits human brain glioblastoma GBM 8401 cell migration and invasion through the inhibition of uPA, Rho A, and Ras with inhibition of MMP-2, -7 and -9 gene expression.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate suppresses EGF-stimulated SAS human oral squamous carcinoma cell invasion by targeting EGF receptor signaling.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'Phenethyl Isothiocyanate, a Dual Activator of Transcription Factors NRF2 and HSF1.', 'Reactivation of mutant p53 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by isothiocyanate inhibits tumor growth.', 'Prospective Epigenetic Actions of Organo-Sulfur Compounds against Cancer: Perspectives and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Anticarcinogenic Effects of Isothiocyanates on Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.']"""

Dysregulation in biological stress processes underlies the impact of poor sleep on the onset and/or progression of depressive symptoms, yet few studies have sought to identify potential neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., HPA axis activation) underlying this association in PC survivors. The present study examines the relationships between sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and indices of diurnal cortisol patterns among men treated for prostate cancer. In total, 66 men (84.8% White; mean age = 65.8 years, SD = 9.04) treated in the prior 2 years for localized prostate cancer were recruited. They completed questionnaires to measure sleep quality and depressive symptoms at study entry (T1) and 4 months later (T2). They also provided 4 saliva samples per day, over 3 days, at T1. Three cortisol indices were computed: diurnal slope, area under the curve (AUCg), and cortisol awakening response (CAR). Analyses indicate that, controlling for body mass index and age, worse sleep quality at T1 was significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms at T2. Significant indirect effects were observed for cortisol slope (indirect effect = -.17, 95% CI [-.61, -.01]) and AUCg (indirect effect = -.14, 95% CI [-.43, -.01]), but not CAR. Results suggest that dysregulation in HPA activity acts as a neurobiological mechanism of the impact of sleep disruption on depressive symptoms in men with prostate cancer.

We present what is to our knowledge the first preclinical evaluation of 3-dimensional prostate visualization using transurethral ultrasound and the preliminary results of this new augmented reality.  Materials and methods:   The transurethral probe and laparoscopic/ultrasound registration were tested on realistic prostate phantoms made of standard polyvinyl chloride. The quality of transurethral ultrasound images and the detection of passive markers placed on the prostate surface were evaluated on 2-dimensional dynamic views and 3-dimensional reconstructions. The feasibility, precision and reproducibility of laparoscopic/transurethral ultrasound registration was then determined using 4, 5, 6 and 7 markers to assess the optimal amount needed. The root mean square error was calculated for each registration and the median root mean square error and IQR were calculated according to the number of markers.  Results:   The transurethral ultrasound probe was easy to manipulate and the prostatic capsule was well visualized in 2 and 3 dimensions. Passive markers could precisely be localized in the volume. Laparoscopic/transurethral ultrasound registration procedures were performed on 74 phantoms of various sizes and shapes. All were successful. The median root mean square error of 1.1 mm (IQR 0.8-1.4) was significantly associated with the number of landmarks (p = 0.001). The highest accuracy was achieved using 6 markers. However, prostate volume did not affect registration precision.  Conclusions:   Transurethral ultrasound provided high quality prostate reconstruction and easy marker detection.

The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression signature of the five genes was determined in 144 PCa and benign prostate specimens from prostatectomy. We showed that the five-gene panel distinguished PCa from benign prostate with sensitivity of 96.59 %, specificity of 92.86 %, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992 (p < 0.0001). The five-gene panel was further validated in a 137 specimen cohort and showed sensitivity of 84.62 %, specificity of 91.84 %, and AUC of 0.942 (p < 0.0001). To define subtypes of PCa for treatment guidance, we examined mRNA expression signature of an eight-gene panel in 87 PCa specimens from prostatectomy. The signature of the eight-gene panel was able to distinguish aggressive PCa (Gleason score >6) from indolent PCa (Gleason score ≤6) with sensitivity of 90.28 %, specificity of 80.00 %, and AUC of 0.967 (p < 0.0001). This panel was further validated in a 158 specimen cohort and showed significant difference between aggressive PCa and indolent PCa with sensitivity of 92.57 %, specificity of 70.00 %, and AUC of 0.962 (p < 0.0001). Our findings in assessing multiple biomarkers in combination may provide new tools to detect PCa and distinguish aggressive and indolent PCa for precision and personalized treatment. The two biomarker panels may be used in clinical settings for accurate PCa diagnosis and patient risk stratification for biomarker-guided treatment.""","""['Kefeng Xiao', 'Jinan Guo', 'Xuhui Zhang', 'Xiaoyan Feng', 'Heqiu Zhang', 'Zhiqiang Cheng', 'Heather Johnson', 'Jenny L Persson', 'Lingwu Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['A Panel of Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer Using Urine Samples.', 'Expression analysis of osteopontin mRNA splice variants in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Urinary endogenous peptides as biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Non-invasive Urine Test for Molecular Classification of Clinical Significance in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'KLK3 SNP-SNP interactions for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'A 23-Gene Classifier urine test for prostate cancer prognosis.', 'Establishing a Urine-Based Biomarker Assay for Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification.']"""

Evidence shows that angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers may be associated with improved outcome in prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, our previous studies indicate that increased expression of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) alone induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer lines, an effect that did not require Ang II. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AT2R on tumor growth in vivo and we hypothesized that AT2R over-expression would inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in vivo. Human prostate cancer DU145 xenograft mouse model was used to assess the effect of AT2R on tumor growth in vivo. Mice bearing a palpable tumor were chosen and divided randomly into three treatment groups: AT2R, GFP, and PBS. Then we directly injected into the xenograft tumors of the mice every three days with recombinant adenoviruses encoding AT2R (Ad5-CMV-AT2R-EGFP), EGFP (Ad5-CMV-EGFP) and PBS, respectively. The tumor sizes of the tumor bearing mice were then measured. Immunohistochemical Ki-67 staining and TUNEL assay were performed to examine the inhibitory effect of AT2R on tumor cell proliferation. The results showed that AT2R overexpression can inhibit tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. GADD45A is involved in the AT2R-induced antitumor activity. This suggests that AT2R is a potentially useful gene for prostate gene therapy.""","""['Jinlong Li', 'Jie Luo', 'Dongsheng Gu', 'Feilong Jie', 'Nana Pei', 'Andrew Li', 'Xinglu Chen', 'Yanling Zhang', 'Hongyan Du', 'Baihong Chen', 'Weiwang Gu', 'Colin Sumners', 'Hongwei Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Angiotensin II type 2 receptor promotes apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in bladder cancer.', 'Angiotensin type 2 receptor-mediated apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gene expression profiling associated with angiotensin II type 2 receptor-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Angiotensin type 2 receptor in hypertensive cardiovascular disease.', 'Recent Research Advances in Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Receptors.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'Puerarin induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via inactivation of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.', 'Effects of zinc finger protein 403 on the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of prostate cancer cells.', 'L-securinine inhibits cell growth and metastasis of human androgen-independent prostate cancer DU145 cells via regulating mitochondrial and AGTR1/MEK/ERK/STAT3/PAX2 apoptotic pathways.', 'Angiotensin II type 2 receptor promotes apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in bladder cancer.']"""

Sorting Out the Influence of Method of Detection, Access to Care, and Biologic Factors""","""Background:   Multiple studies have yielded important findings regarding the determinants of an advanced-stage diagnosis of breast cancer. We seek to advance this line of inquiry through a broadened conceptual framework and accompanying statistical modeling strategy that recognize the dual importance of access-to-care and biologic factors on stage.  Methods:   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study yielded a seven-state, cancer registry-derived population-based sample of 9,142 women diagnosed with a first primary in situ or invasive breast cancer in 2004. The likelihood of advanced-stage cancer (American Joint Committee on Cancer IIIB, IIIC, or IV) was investigated through multivariable regression modeling, with base-case analyses using the method of instrumental variables (IV) to detect and correct for possible selection bias. The robustness of base-case findings was examined through extensive sensitivity analyses.  Results:   Advanced-stage disease was negatively associated with detection by mammography (P < 0.001) and with age < 50 (P < 0.001), and positively related to black race (P = 0.07), not being privately insured [Medicaid (P = 0.01), Medicare (P = 0.04), uninsured (P = 0.07)], being single (P = 0.06), body mass index > 40 (P = 0.001), a HER2 type tumor (P < 0.001), and tumor grade not well differentiated (P < 0.001). This IV model detected and adjusted for significant selection effects associated with method of detection (P = 0.02). Sensitivity analyses generally supported these base-case results.  Conclusions:   Through our comprehensive modeling strategy and sensitivity analyses, we provide new estimates of the magnitude and robustness of the determinants of advanced-stage breast cancer.  Impact:   Statistical approaches frequently used to address observational data biases in treatment-outcome studies can be applied similarly in analyses of the determinants of stage at diagnosis.

We examined the association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness in Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA) and explored effect modification by health-seeking behaviors associated with statin use.  Methods:   Of 1,930 cases from The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project, 344 (18%) were classified as aggressive based on clinical criteria. Utilizing nonaggressive cases as referent, logistic regression was used to examine the association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness, overall and stratified by race. Smoking and prostate cancer screening were examined as effect modifiers of this association.  Results:   There was an inverse association between statin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness [OR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.96], with comparable effect estimates in both races. Although not statistically significant, statin use was associated with reduced ORs for aggressive prostate cancer in never-screened men (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.45-1.39), men screened at low/recommended frequency (≤once/year; OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06), and men screened at high frequency (>once/year; OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53-1.15). Inverse associations between statins and aggressive prostate cancer were strongest in never smokers (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.72), attenuated in former smokers (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59-1.19), and absent in current smokers (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.70-2.64).  Conclusions:   Statin use was associated with reduced prostate cancer aggressiveness in CA and AAs, with strongest inverse associations in nonsmokers.

Simulated ultrasound imaging artifacts include reverberation and reflection of the cryoprobes in the unfrozen tissue, reflections caused by the freezing front, shadowing caused by the frozen region, and tissue property changes in repeated freeze-thaw cycles procedures. The simulated artifacts appear to preserve the key features observed in a clinical setting.

Materials and methods:   A customized tool was created to hold the prostatectomy specimens during optical coherence tomography measurements and formalin fixation. Using the tool, the prostate could be sliced into slices of 4 mm thickness through the optical coherence tomography measurement trajectory. In this way, whole-mount pathology slides were produced in exactly the same location as the optical coherence tomography measurements were performed. Full 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography pullbacks were fused with the histopathology slides using the 3-dimensional imaging software AMIRA, and images were compared.  Results:   A radical prostatectomy was performed in a patient (age: 68 years, prostate-specific antigen: 6.0 ng/mL) with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 in 2/5 biopsy cores on the left side (15%) and Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 in 1/5 biopsy cores on the right side (5%). Histopathology after radical prostatectomy showed an anterior located pT2cNx adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7). Histopathological prostate slides were produced using the customized tool for optical coherence tomography measurements, fixation, and slicing of the prostate specimens. These slides correlated exactly with the optical coherence tomography images. Various structures, for example, Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer, stroma, healthy glands, and cystic atrophy with septae, could be identified both on optical coherence tomography and on the histopathological prostate slides.  Conclusion:   We successfully designed and applied a customized tool to process radical prostatectomy specimens to improve the coregistration of whole mount histology sections to fresh tissue optical coherence tomography pullback measurements. This technique will be crucial in validating the results of optical coherence tomography imaging studies with histology and can easily be applied in other solid tissues as well, for example, lung, kidney, breast, and liver.

In addition, AR(-/-) mice showed attenuation of AAA growth (64.4% ± 22.7%; P < .0001) compared with WT elastase. Cytokine arrays of aortic tissue revealed decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-α, IL-6, and IL-17 in flutamide-treated and AR(-/-) groups compared with controls.

Given their antioxidant properties, we hypothesized that lycopene and tomato sauce may be especially protective against diseases harboring the common gene fusion transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2):v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG).  Objective:   We aimed to examine associations between estimated lycopene and tomato sauce intake and the risk of prostate cancer defined by ERG protein expression subtype.  Design:   Our study population consisted of a prospective cohort of 46,719 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. TMPRSS2:ERG was assessed by ERG immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue microarrays constructed from radical prostatectomy specimens. We used multivariable competing risk models to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for the risk of ERG-positive and, separately, ERG-negative disease. We implemented inverse probability weighting to account for evaluating ERG status only in surgically treated cases.  Results:   During 23 y of follow-up, 5543 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, among whom 884 were assayed for ERG (426 ERG-positive). With inclusion of only the latter cases, increasing cumulative average tomato sauce intake was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer overall (≥2 servings/wk compared with <1 serving/mo; multivariable HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.95; P-trend = 0.002). With respect to molecular subtypes, cumulative average tomato sauce intake was associated with a decreased risk of ERG-positive disease (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81; P-trend = 0.004) but not with ERG-negative disease (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.50; P-trend = 0.10) (P-heterogeneity = 0.04). Increasing quintiles of lycopene intake were associated with a decreased risk of both subtypes (P-heterogeneity = 0.79). Inverse probability weighting did not materially change the results.

However, there is still a lack of prospective metabolomics studies on pre-diagnostic metabolic alterations and cancer risk.  Methods:   Associations between pre-diagnostic levels of 120 circulating metabolites (acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingolipids, and hexoses) and the risks of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer were evaluated by Cox regression analyses using data of a prospective case-cohort study including 835 incident cancer cases.  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 8.3 years among non-cases and 6.5 years among incident cases of cancer. Higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs), and especially lysoPC a C18:0, were consistently related to lower risks of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, independent of background factors. In contrast, higher levels of phosphatidylcholine PC ae C30:0 were associated with increased cancer risk. There was no heterogeneity in the observed associations by lag time between blood draw and cancer diagnosis.

This is assumed to be especially relevant for hypofractionated protocols in which intrafractional motion does not easily average out. In order to confidently deliver tracked treatments with potentially reduced margins, it is necessary to monitor not only the patient anatomy but also the actually delivered dose during irradiation. In this study, we present a novel real-time online dose reconstruction tool which calculates actually delivered dose based on pre-calculated dose influence data in less than 10 ms at a rate of 25 Hz. Using this tool we investigate the impact of clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margins on CTV coverage and organ-at-risk dose. On our research linear accelerator, a set of four different CTV-to-PTV margins were tested for three patient cases subject to four different motion conditions. Based on this data, we can conclude that tracking eliminates dose cold spots which can occur in the CTV during conventional deliveries even for the smallest CTV-to-PTV margin of 1 mm. Changes of organ-at-risk dose do occur frequently during MLC tracking and are not negligible in some cases. Intrafractional dose reconstruction is expected to become an important element in any attempt of re-planning the treatment plan during the delivery based on the observed anatomy of the day.""","""['M F Fast', 'C P Kamerling', 'P Ziegenhein', 'M J Menten', 'J L Bedford', 'S Nill', 'U Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A method of calculating a lung clinical target volume DVH for IMRT with intrafractional motion.', 'Real-time 4D dose reconstruction for tracked dynamic MLC deliveries for lung SBRT.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Quantifying the effect of intrafraction motion during breast IMRT planning and dose delivery.', 'Motion compensation in radiotherapy.', 'Reducing the margin in prostate radiotherapy: optimizing radiotherapy with a general-purpose linear accelerator using an in-house position monitoring system.', 'Characteristics of a real-time radiation exposure dosimetry system using a synthetic ruby for radiotherapy.', 'Effect of intrafraction adaptation on PTV margins for MRI guided online adaptive radiotherapy for rectal cancer.', 'A phase space model of a Versa HD linear accelerator for application to Monte Carlo dose calculation in a real-time adaptive workflow.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.']"""

However, molecular signatures associated with these distinct PSMA-PSA prostate clones and their specific correlation with disease outcome is yet to be defined.  Aim:   Since Akt is a major pathway involved in the critical activating events that leads to malignant form of the disease, we studied the involvement of full Akt activation (T308+,S473+) connected with serum PSA levels, tissue PSMA expression and angiogenic activity on the emergence of (PSMA+,PSA+) and (PSMA+,PSA-) PC clones.  Methods:   The study was carried out in 6 normal prostate, 25 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 23 (PC). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to study the expression of PSMA, PSA, pAkt(T308), pAkt(S473) and CD34 in prostate tissues. The evaluation of angiogenesis was made by CD34 immune marker. Serum levels of PSA were assayed by Immulite autoanalyser.  Results:   The most relevant result showed that, among PC patients with pAkt (T308+,S473+) profile, patients that exhibit the (PSMA+,PSA+) clone have .higher serum PSA levels, tissue PSMA expression and angiogenic activity than those with (PSMA+,PSA-) clone. Although have the same (PSMA+,PSA+) prostate clone, BPH patients have distinct molecular-biological features compared to PC patients among pAkt (T308+,S473+) profile. In fact, among patients with maximal Akt activation, the (PSMA+,PSA+) PC clone is characterized by higher serum PSA levels, tissue PSMA production and intensive angiogenic activity than (PSMA+,PSA+) BPH clone.  Conclusion:   These findings emphasize the potential role of the full Akt activation (T308+,S473+) in expansion of several PSMA-PSA prostate clones capable of driving both human PC initiation as well as progression to a metastatic phenotype. Pinpoint patients according to PSMA-PSA clones could recapitulate the histological and molecular features of human PC and may offer a novel approach for controlling metastasis.""","""['Awatef Ben Jemaa', 'Yosra Bouraoui', 'Sataa Sallami', 'Ahmed Banasr', 'Yassine Nouira', 'Ali Horchani', 'Ridha Oueslati']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Tunis Med""","""['PSA-PSMA profiles and their impact on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'PSMA/PSA ratio evaluated by immunohistochemistry may improve diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Cytokine profiling identifies an interaction of IL-6 and IL-1α to drive PSMA-PSA prostate clones.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Updated application of prostate-specific membrane antigen to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus caveolin-3 K15N mutation on glycometabolism.']"""

In vivo experiments were carried out in PC3 xenografts in CD1 nude mice to assess NIS expression and tumor radioiodide uptake. In addition, the therapeutic benefit of radioiodide treatment in combination with viral oncolysis and external beam radiotherapy was measured. In vitro viral cell killing of prostate cancers was dose- and time-dependent and was through apoptotic mechanisms. Importantly, combined virus therapy and iodizing radiation did not adversely affect oncolysis. NIS gene expression in infected cells was functional and mediated uptake of radioiodide both in vitro and in vivo. Therapy experiments with both xenograft and immunocompetent Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mouse models showed that the addition of radioiodide to VV-NIS-infected tumors was more effective than each single-agent therapy, restricting tumor growth and increasing survival.

Patients and methods:   Plasmas from healthy volunteers, benign prostatic hyperplasia patients, and PCa patients with various Gleason score patterns were analyzed for PMPs. We used nanoscale flow cytometry to enumerate PMPs which were defined as submicron events (100-1000nm) immunoreactive to anti-PSMA mAb when compared to isotype control labeled samples. Levels of PMPs (counts/µL of plasma) were also compared to CellSearch CTC Subclasses in various PCa metastatic disease subtypes (treatment naïve, castration resistant prostate cancer) and in serially collected plasma sets from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Results:   PMP levels in plasma as enumerated by nanoscale flow cytometry are effective in distinguishing PCa patients with Gleason Score≥8 disease, a high-risk prognostic factor, from patients with Gleason Score≤7 PCa, which carries an intermediate risk of PCa recurrence. PMP levels were independent of PSA and significantly decreased after surgical resection of the prostate, demonstrating its prognostic potential for clinical follow-up. CTC subclasses did not decrease after prostatectomy and were not effective in distinguishing localized PCa patients from metastatic PCa patients.  Conclusions:   PMP enumeration was able to identify patients with Gleason Score ≥8 PCa but not patients with Gleason Score 4+3 PCa, but offers greater confidence than CTC counts in identifying patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

To further functionally characterise the FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF signal transduction pathway, we have, in this work, investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in its tumorigenicity promoting role in prostate cancer. Suppression of PPARγ in highly malignant prostate cancer cells produced a significant reduction (up to 53%) in their proliferation rate, invasiveness (up to 89%) and anchorage-independent growth (up to 94%) in vitro. Knockdown of PPARγ gene in PC3-M cells by siRNA significantly reduced the average size of tumours formed in nude mice by 99% and tumour incidence by 90%, and significantly prolonged the latent period by 3.5 fold. Results in this study combined with some previous results suggested that FABP5 promoted VEGF expression and angiogenesis through PPARγ which was activated by fatty acids transported by FABP5. Further investigations showed that PPARγ up-regulated VEGF expression through acting with the PPAR-responsive elements in the promoter region of VEGF gene in prostate cancer cells. Although androgen can modulate VEGF expression through Sp1/Sp3 binding site on VEGF promoter in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, this route, disappeared as the cells gradually lost their androgen dependency; was replaced by the FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF signalling pathway.

In this paper, mortality rates are analyzed by region, time period and age group, and models including space-time, space-age, and age-time interactions are considered. The integrated nested Laplace approximation method, known as INLA, is adopted for model fitting and inference in order to reduce computing time in comparison with Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods. The methodology provides full posterior distributions of the quantities of interest while avoiding complex simulation techniques. The proposed models are used to analyze prostate cancer mortality data in 50 Spanish provinces over the period 1986-2010. The results reveal a decline in mortality since the late 1990s, particularly in the age group [65,70), probably because of the inclusion of the PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and better treatment of early-stage disease. The decline is not clearly observed in the oldest age groups.

Methods:   A total of 65 patients with high risk prostate cancer were treated with surgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2011 to June 2013. The mean age was 67 years (range 45-75 years). The mean preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was 26.7 µg/L (range 11.2-65.5 µg/L). The transrectal biopsy revealed Gleason score of 3+3 in 4 patients, Gleason 3+4 in 27 patients, Gleason 4+3 in 11 patients, Gleason 4+4 in 21 patients and Gleason 4+5 in 2 patients. The bone metastasis was excluded by scintigraphy examination. The surgical procedures were performed through transperitoneal approach. Extended pelvic lymph nodes dissection was performed after the removal of the prostate. Adjuvant radiotherapy or hormonal therapy was administrated according to the pathological results. Serum PSA was detected every 1 to 2 month and urinary continence was evaluated every 3 month in the first year, and then serum PSA was detected every 2 to 3 month.  Results:   The mean operative time was (134±21) minutes and the median blood loss was (300±146) ml. Bladder neck reconstruction was performed in 15 cases. The drainage was removed on postoperative day 4 and the catheter was removed on day 7. Pathologic results demonstrated pT2 in 25 patients, pT3a in 28 patients, pT3b in 9 patients and pT4 in 3 patients. Positive surgical margin was presented in 15 patients. A median of 19 lymph nodes (range 11-24 nodes) were retrieved during lymphadenectomy and 11 patients had lymph nodes metastasis with a total of 19 positive nodes. Forty-three patients recovered continence after the removal of catheter. Eleven patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy and 19 patients received adjuvant radiation therapy. With the median of 20 months follow-up (range 12-30 months), 5 patients got biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with extended lymph nodes dissection for high risk prostate cancer is safe and technical feasible. It provides accurate information on tumor stage and grade.

Materials and methods:   MiR-301a/b expression in hypoxia and normoxia cultured prostate cancer cells was measured. Its regulation on autophagy was measured by quantifying expression change of LC3B and p62.

The influence of miR-301a/b-NDRG2 axis on autophagy, viability and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was further investigated.  Results:   Hypoxia induced a significant upregulation of miR-301a/b in prostate cancer cells. Enhanced miR-301a/b expression significantly weakened autophagy of prostate cancer cells. Both miR-301a and miR-301b could directly target 3'UTR of NDRG2 and decrease its expression.

Experimental design:   We analyzed the clinical significance of DNA ploidy in combination with prognostic relevant deletions of PTEN and 6q15 in 3,845 prostate cancers.  Result:   The DNA status was diploid in 67.8%, tetraploid in 25.6%, and aneuploid in 6.8% of tumors, and deletions of PTEN and 6q15 occurred in 17.8% and 20.3% of tumors. Abnormal DNA content and deletions were linked to high Gleason score, advanced tumor stage, and positive nodal stage (P < 0.0001 each). The risk of PSA recurrence increased from diploid to tetraploid and from tetraploid to aneuploid DNA status (P < 0.0001 each). However, 40% of patients with Gleason score ≥4+4 and 55% of patients with PSA recurrence had diploid cancers. This fraction decreased to 21% (Gleason ≥4+4) and 29% (PSA recurrence) if PTEN and/or 6q deletion data were added to ploidy data to identify cancers with an aberrant DNA status. The significance of combining both deletions and ploidy was further demonstrated in a combined recurrence analysis. Presence of deletions increased the risk of PSA recurrence in diploid (P < 0.0001), tetraploid (P < 0.0001), and aneuploid cancers (P = 0.0049), and the combination of ploidy data and deletions provided clinically relevant information beyond the CAPRA-S nomogram. Multivariate modeling including preoperatively and postoperatively available parameters identified the ""combined DNA status"" as a strong independent predictor of poor patient outcome.

All current non-steroidal AR antagonists, such as hydroxyflutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, target the androgen binding site of the receptor, competing with endogenous androgenic steroids. Several AR mutations in this binding site have been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to conventional prostate cancer drugs. In order to develop an effective CRPC therapy, it is crucial to understand the effects of these mutations on the functionality of the AR and its ability to interact with endogenous steroids and conventional AR inhibitors.  Results:   We previously utilized circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing technology to examine the AR gene for the presence of mutations in CRPC patients. By modifying our sequencing and data analysis approaches, we identify four additional single AR mutations and five mutation combinations associated with CRPC. Importantly, we conduct experimental functionalization of all the AR mutations identified by the current and previous cfDNA sequencing to reveal novel gain-of-function scenarios. Finally, we evaluate the effect of a novel class of AR inhibitors targeting the binding function 3 (BF3) site on the activity of CRPC-associated AR mutants.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of mortality data and to investigate cancer mortality patterns in the occupied Palestinian territory's West Bank governorates from 1999 to 2009.  Methods:   Death certificates collected by the Palestinian Ministry of Health for Palestinians living in the West Bank were used. Direct and indirect age-standardised mortality rates were computed and used to compare different governorates according to total and specific cancer mortality. Furthermore, standardised proportional mortality ratios were calculated to compare mortality by urban, rural and camp locales.  Results:   The most common cause of death out of all cancer types was lung cancer among males (22.8 %) and breast cancer among females (21.5 %) followed by prostate cancer for males (9.5 %) and by colon cancer for females (11.4 %). Regional variations in cancer-specific causes of death were observed. The central- West Bank governorates had the lowest mortality for most cancer types among men and women. Mortality for lung cancer was highest in the north among men (SMR 109.6; 95%CI 99.5-120.4). For prostate cancer, mortality was highest in the north (SMR 103.6; 95%CI 88.5-120.5) and in the south (SMR 118.6; 95%CI 98.9-141.0). Breast cancer mortality was highest in the south (SMR 119.3; 95%CI 103.9-136.2). Similar mortality rate patterns were found in urban, rural and camp locales.

Age-standardized rates and numbers of deaths are predicted for 2016 in the European Union (EU).  Patients and methods:   Population and death certification data for stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, prostate, leukaemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organization database and Eurostat. Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected numbers of deaths by age group were obtained for 2016 by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period identified by a joinpoint regression model.  Results:   Projected total cancer mortality trends for 2016 in the EU are favourable in both sexes with rates of 133.5/100 000 men and 85.2/100 000 women (8% and 3% falls since 2011) corresponding to 753 600 and 605 900 deaths in men and women for a total number of 1 359 500 projected cancer deaths (+3% compared with 2011, due to population ageing). In men, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer have fallen 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, since 2011. Breast and colorectal cancer trends in women are favourable (8% and 7% falls, respectively), but lung and pancreatic cancer rates have risen 5% and 4% since 2011 reaching rates of 14.4 and 5.6/100 000 women. Leukaemias show favourable projected mortality for both sexes and all age groups, with stronger falls in the younger age groups. All ages rates are 4.0/100 000 men and 2.5/100 000 women, with falls of 14% and 12% respectively.  Conclusion:   The 2016 predictions for EU cancer mortality confirm the favourable trends in rates particularly for men. Lung cancer is likely to be the leading site for female cancer rates. Continuing falls in mortality, larger in children and young adults, are predicted in leukaemias, essentially due to advancements in management and therapy, and their subsequent adoption across Europe.""","""['M Malvezzi', 'G Carioli', 'P Bertuccio', 'T Rosso', 'P Boffetta', 'F Levi', 'C La Vecchia', 'E Negri']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2015: does lung cancer have the highest death rate in EU women?', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2014.', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2018 with focus on colorectal cancer.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Recent estimates and predictions of 5-year survival rate in patients with pancreatic cancer: A model-based period analysis.', 'Characterization of fecal microbiome in biopsy positive prostate cancer patients.', 'Association between Risk Factors and the Existence of Lung Malignancies in a Population from the South-West Romania: A Single-Center Study.', 'Hsa_circ_0050102 regulates the pancreatic cancer development via miR-218-5p/PPME1 axis.', 'One-year Mortality of Cancer Patients with an Unplanned ICU Admission: A Cohort Analysis Between 2008 and 2017 in the Netherlands.']"""
