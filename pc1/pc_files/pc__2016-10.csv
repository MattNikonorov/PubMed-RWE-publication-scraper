Several studies have demonstrated that the in vitro application of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) leads to promoter remethylation and the downregulation of proto-oncogene expression in cancer cells. It is not clear if this represents a general mechanism of SAM or is limited to selected genes. We examined this problem using new bisulfite sequencing and transcriptomic technologies. Treatment with SAM caused the downregulation of proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. RNA sequencing revealed the genome-wide downregulation of genes involved in proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Real-time PCR of a subset of the genes confirmed these results. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) displayed only minor differential methylation between treated cells and controls. In summary, we confirmed the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of SAM. Additionally, we observed anti-migratory effects and downregulation of genes, especially those related to cancerogenesis. For some of the related genes, this is the first reported evidence of an association with prostate cancer. However, genome-wide modifications in methylation profiles were not observed by RRBS; thus, they are obviously not a major cause of alteration in transcription profiles and anti-cancer effects.""","""['Thomas Schmidt', 'Andreas Leha', 'Gabriela Salinas-Riester']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Pharmacological methyl group donors block skeletal metastasis in vitro and in vivo.', 'DNA methylation regulates expression of VEGF-C, and S-adenosylmethionine is effective for VEGF-C methylation and for inhibiting cancer growth.', 'Alteration of the methylation status of tumor-promoting genes decreases prostate cancer cell invasiveness and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.', 'S-adenosylmethionine blocks osteosarcoma cells proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo: therapeutic and diagnostic clinical applications.', 'DNA methylation or histone modification status in metastasis and angiogenesis-related genes: a new hypothesis on usage of DNMT inhibitors and S-adenosylmethionine for genome stability.', 'Gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1 supports S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis and promotes H3K9me3 modification to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma progression.', 'Cul4A-DDB1-mediated monoubiquitination of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase promotes colorectal cancer metastasis via increased S-adenosylmethionine.', 'Unraveling the functional role of DNA demethylation at specific promoters by targeted steric blockage of DNA methyltransferase with CRISPR/dCas9.', 'The Crucial Roles of Intermediate Metabolites in Cancer.', 'S-Adenosylmethionine Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Alters DNA Methylation, DNA Repair and Tumor Progression-Related Gene Expression.']"""

We aimed to assess QoL during ADT using two validated questionnaires and determine contributing factors.  Design:   Prospective controlled study.  Patients:   Sixty-three men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer newly commencing ADT (n = 34) and age- and radiotherapy-matched prostate cancer controls (n = 29).  Measurements:   QoL was measured by Short-Form 12 version 2 survey (SF-12) and Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) score at 0, 6 and 12 months. Generalized linear models determined the mean adjusted difference (MAD) (95% confidence interval) between groups during follow-up.  Results:   Compared to controls over 12 months, men receiving ADT had decreased SF-12 physical component score [MAD -3·61 (-6·94, -0·29), P = 0·013] reflecting worsening QoL but no change in the mental component (P = 0·74). Total AMS score increased [MAD 9·35 (5·65, 13·07), P < 0·001], reflecting worse QoL. Both SF-12 and AMS changes were greater than reported minimum clinically important differences. AMS sub-domains showed increased somatic [MAD 3·96 (1·94, 5·99), P < 0·001] and sexual [MAD 3·80 (2·16, 5·44), P < 0·001] components but not psychological (P = 0·19). Decrements were related to an increase in hot flushes (P = 0·016) but not haemoglobin decrease (P = 0·46).  Conclusions:   Within 12 months, ADT is associated with clinically significant decreased QoL, particularly physical and sexual aspects, independent of the confounding effects of a cancer diagnosis or radiotherapy. As QoL is a crucial aspect of prostate cancer treatment, addressing hot flushes, sexual dysfunction and exercise may potentially improve outcomes for men undergoing ADT.""","""['Ada S Cheung', 'Casey de Rooy', 'Rudolf Hoermann', 'Daryl Lim Joon', 'Jeffrey D Zajac', 'Mathis Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)""","""['Sexual bother in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Quality of life in prostate cancer patients taking androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Persisting adverse body composition changes 2 years after cessation of androgen deprivation therapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Exercise improves quality of life in androgen deprivation therapy-treated prostate cancer: systematic review of randomised controlled trials.', 'Contemporary use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: managing complications and addressing quality-of-life issues.', 'Focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy with implantable rectum spacer for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial low-dose-rate with grade 3 rectal toxicity.', 'Nationwide Industry-Led Community Exercise Program for Men With Locally Advanced, Relapsed, or Metastatic Prostate Cancer on Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Quality of life in low-income men after surgical castration for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A distance-based, randomized controlled trial for reducing sedentary behavior among prostate cancer survivors: a study protocol.', 'The effects of exercise on body composition of prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy: An update systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Interestingly, GOAT levels in PCa-patients correlated with aggressiveness and metabolic conditions (i.e. diabetes). Actually, GOAT expression was regulated by metabolic inputs (i.e. In1-ghrelin, insulin/IGF-I) in cultured normal prostate cells and PCa-cell lines. Importantly, ROC-curve analysis unveiled a valuable diagnostic potential for GOAT to discriminate PCa at the tissue/plasma/urine-level with high sensitivity/specificity, particularly in non-diabetic individuals. Moreover, we discovered that GOAT is secreted by PCa-cells, and that its levels are higher in urine samples from a stimulated post-massage vs. pre-massage prostate-test.

In addition, the regulative effect of UCA1/miR-204/Sirt1 axis on docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells was studied.  Methods:   QRT-PCR was performed to detect UCA1, miR-204 and Sirt1 mRNA expression. Western blot assay was performed to assess Sirt1, P-gp and caspase-3 expression. The regulative effect of UCA1/miR-204/Sirt1 axis on docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells was examined by measurement of docetaxel IC50, dictation of cleaved caspase-3 and flow cytometric analysis of cell apoptosis.  Results:   MiR-204 negatively modulated Sirt1 expression in prostate cancer cells. UCA1 upregulation directly resulted in decreased miR-204 expression. UCA1 overexpression resulted in increased Sirt1 expression in PNT2 cells, while knockdown of endogenous UCA1 led to decreased Sirt1 in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells. UCA1 siRNA, Sirt1 siRNA and miR-204 mimics could enhance docetaxel-induced activation of caspase-3 and cell apoptosis in 22RV1/DR cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate urinary incontinence (UI) and sexual dysfunction (SD) two years after treatment for localized prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   This study followed all cases of localized PC diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 in men aged≤65years old and still alive two years after treatment. In total, 437 men were recruited. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and by cross-checking with data from the cancer registry. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed to evaluate persisting UI and SD at 2years.  Results:   At two years after treatment, UI was persistent in 48.8%; 41.2% had used urinary protections, and 39.2% had used at least 1 pad/day; 55.2% reported financial difficulties for purchasing protective pads. In total, 22.7% did not consult a specialist for UI. SD was persistent in 82.8%; 30.4% did not consult a specialist for SD. SD had a negative impact on the sex life of patients and their partners. After adjustment for cancer stage, prostatectomy was significantly associated with persisting UI and SD at two years.  Conclusion:   Two years after treatment, rates of persisting UI and/or SD remain high. Treatment by prostatectomy was significantly associated with an increased risk of persisting adverse effects at two years. The different toxicities between treatments should be presented to patients before initiating therapy in order to encourage the patient to contributed to shared treatment decision-making.""","""['Faïza Bessaoud', 'Mattéa Orsini', 'François Iborra', 'Xavier Rebillard', 'Antoine Faix', 'Maryvonne Soulier', 'Jean-Pierre Daurès', 'Brigitte Trétarre']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Bull Cancer""","""['Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'The Relationship Between Incontinence and Erectile Dysfunction After Robotic Prostatectomy: Are They Mutually Exclusive?', 'Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite versus Incontinence Symptom Index and Sexual Health Inventory for Men to measure functional outcomes after prostatectomy.', 'Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer: A nationwide observational study.', 'Erectile dysfunction and incontinence after prostatectomy.

Aim:   To assess rates of patient discussion about sexuality with health care providers after cancer.  Methods:   We used data from the representative French nationwide 2012 VICAN survey, which included 4,349 adults 18 to 82 years old who were still alive 2 years after diagnosis at 12 cancer sites.  Main outcome measures:   Self-reported rates of discussion about sexuality with health care providers were assessed, and associated factors were tested after systematic adjustment for a sexual health indicator (created from six items of the Relationship and Sexuality Scale).  Results:   Of 4,181 respondents to the question on a discussion about sexuality, 54.7% reported that nobody had proposed a discussion to them, 21.9% did not want any discussion, and 23.4% had had a discussion. Women had less discussion about sexuality with health care providers (11.1% vs 36.7% of men, P < .001) and were more likely to request a discussion at their own initiative (62.9% vs 48.0% of men, P < .001). Discussion about sexuality was more frequent with patients with prostate (56.3%) and cervical (39.6%) cancer, but increasing age was associated with a greater reluctance to discuss this issue (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.2). The likelihood of discussion increased with severe sexual problems, radiotherapy, general sequelae, having an information-seeker profile, previous professional psychological help, and initial treatment in private centers. Patients initially wishing for psychological help were more likely to desire a discussion about sexuality.  Conclusion:   Sexuality receives little attention in French patients with cancer. Inequalities in the discussion about sexuality were observed in relation to the type of care center where the patient was initially managed. Information on supportive interventions, including more systematic referral for professional psychological help, should be developed to facilitate discussion and should be offered to all patients, irrespective of severity of sexual problems, age, sex, cancer site, and care center.""","""['Ali Ben Charif', 'Anne-Déborah Bouhnik', 'Blandine Courbiere', 'Dominique Rey', 'Marie Préau', 'Marc-Karim Bendiane', 'Patrick Peretti-Watel', 'Julien Mancini']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Sexual health problems in French cancer survivors 2\xa0years after diagnosis-the national VICAN survey.', 'Sexual Health Problems and Discussion in Colorectal Cancer Patients Two Years After Diagnosis: A National Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Sexual health in cancer: the results of a survey exploring practices, attitudes, knowledge, communication, and professional interactions in oncology healthcare providers.', 'A systematic review of characteristics of couple-based intervention studies addressing sexuality following cancer.', 'Sexuality After Cancer: A Model for Male Survivors.', '""How to start that conversation?"": Experiences of developing a virtual simulation about sexual health care for breast cancer survivors.', '« Comment en parler? »: Création d’une simulation virtuelle sur les soins de santé sexuelle destinés aux survivantes du cancer du sein.', 'Do young adults with cancer receive information about treatment-related impact on sex life?

Human NAAA mRNA was previously reported to consist of multiple 3'-end splice variants. However, their tissue distributions and roles have not been examined yet. In the present study, we first identified four major splice variants (tentatively referred to as a1, a2, b2, and c2) in a human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which were composed of exons 1-11, exons 1-10 and 12, exons 1-9 and 12, and exons 1-8 and 12, respectively. We next developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods to individually quantify these NAAA variants as well as collectively measure all the variants. Among various human prostate cancer cells, the total levels of NAAA mRNAs in androgen-sensitive cells like LNCaP were higher than those in androgen-insensitive cells. In all of these prostate cells and other human cells, variants a1 and b2 showed the highest and lowest expression levels, respectively, among the four variants. Interestingly, ratios of the four variants were different by cell type. Variants a1 and a2 encoded the same full-length NAAA protein, which was catalytically active, while b2 and c2 were translated to C-terminally truncated proteins. As expressed in HEK293 cells these truncated forms were detected as catalytically inactive precursor proteins, but not as mature forms. These results revealed wide distribution of multiple variants of NAAA mRNA in various human cells and suggested that the proteins from some variants are catalytically inactive.""","""['Yuma Sakura', 'Kazuhito Tsuboi', 'Toru Uyama', 'Xia Zhang', 'Rikiya Taoka', 'Mikio Sugimoto', 'Yoshiyuki Kakehi', 'Natsuo Ueda']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Expression and secretion of N-acylethanolamine-hydrolysing acid amidase in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular characterization of N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase, a novel member of the choloylglycine hydrolase family with structural and functional similarity to acid ceramidase.', 'The N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA).', 'Predominant expression of lysosomal N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase in macrophages revealed by immunochemical studies.', 'N-acylethanolamine metabolism with special reference to N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA).', 'Inhibition of triple negative breast cancer-associated inflammation and progression by N- acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA).', 'Insights Into the Prognostic Value and Immunological Role of NAAA in Pan-Cancer.', 'N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) is dysregulated in colorectal cancer patients and its inhibition reduces experimental cancer growth.', 'A novel polyethylene glycol (PEG)-drug conjugate of Venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).', 'The rise and fall of anandamide: processes that control synthesis, degradation, and storage.']"""

L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) 1, a Na+ -independent amino acid transporter, is highly expressed in many tumor cells. However, leucine transporter(s) in different stages of prostate cancer, particularly in the stages of castration resistance with androgen receptor (AR) expression, is unclear.  Methods:   LNCaP and DU145 and PC-3 cell lines were used as a model of androgen dependent, and metastatic prostate cancer. A new ""LN-cr"" cell line was established after culturing LNCaP cells for 6 months under androgen-free conditions, which is considered a model of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with androgen AR expression. The expression of leucine transporters was investigated with quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence. Uptake of 14 C Leucine was examined in the presence or absence of BCH (a pan-LAT inhibitor), JPH203 (an LAT1-specific inhibitor), or Na+ . Cell growth was assessed with MTT assay. siRNA studies were performed to evaluate the indispensability of y+ LAT2 on leucine uptake and cell viability in LN-cr.  Results:   Cell viability showed a 90% decrease in the absence of leucine in all four cell lines. LNCaP cells principally expressed LAT3, and their leucine uptake was more than 90% Na+ -independent. BCH, but not JPH203, inhibited leucine uptake, and cell proliferation (IC50BCH :15 mM). DU145 and PC-3 cells predominantly expressed LAT1. Leucine uptake and cell growth were suppressed by BCH or JPH203 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50BCH : ∼20 mM, IC50JPH203 : ∼5 µM). In LN-cr cells, Na+ -dependent uptake of leucine was 3.8 pmol/mgprotein/min, while, Na+ -independent uptake was only 0.52 (P < 0.05). Leucine uptake of LN-cr was largely (∼85%) Na+ -dependent. y+ LAT2 expression was confirmed in LN-cr. Knockdown of y+ LAT2 lead to significant leucine uptake inhibition (40%) and cell growth inhibition (20%).  Conclusions:   New CRPC cell line with increased expression of y+ LAT2 as a leucine transporter was established in vitro. Anti-leucine transporter therapy could be an important option against prostate cancer.

An increased rate of glycolysis is a well known signature of cancer cells. As a survival strategy, Glo1 is overexpressed in many human malignant cells, including prostate cancer (PCa), where it plays a crucial role in progression. No information is available on the role of Glo2 in the same ambit. PCa is the most common malignancy affecting men in the western world. Progression to a lethal hormone-refractory PCa represents the major concern in this pathology. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa invasiveness and metastasis is urgently needed in order to develop novel therapeutic targets for this incurable state of the malignancy.  Methods:   Glo2 and Glo1 expression was examined in clinical samples of PCa by immunohistochemistry and in different PCa cell models by western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene silencing/overexpression and scavenging/inhibitory agents were used for functional analyses.  Results:   We demonstrated that Glo2, together with Glo1, represents a novel mechanism in PCa progression as part of a pathway driven by PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling with involvement of PKM2 and ERα. Importantly, Glo1/Glo2 silencing did not alter the behavior of benign cells.  Conclusions:   Targeting glyoxalases metabolic pathway may represent a strategy to selectively inhibit advanced PCa.

Thus, loss or defects of the LBD abolish constraint from un-liganded LBD as exemplified by constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs), which are associated with emerging resistance mechanism to anti-AR therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Recent analysis of the AR splicing landscapes revealed mCRPC harboring multiple AR-Vs with diverse patterns of inclusion/exclusion of exons (exons 4-8) corresponding to LBD to produce namely exon-skipping variants. In silico construction for these AR-Vs revealed four novel AR-Vs having unique features: Exclusion of specified exons introduces a frameshift in variants v5es, v6es and v7es. ARv56es maintains the reading frame resulting in the inclusion of the C-terminal half of the LBD. We systematically characterized these AR-Vs regarding their subcellular localization, affinity for HSP90 and transactivation capability. Notably, ARv5es was free from HSP90, exclusively nuclear, and constitutively active similarly as previously reported for v567es. In contrast, v6es and v7es were similar in that they are cytoplasmic, transcriptionally inactive and bind HSP90, ARv56es was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm, does not bind HSP90 and is transcriptionally inactive. Converting these transcriptionally inactive AR-Vs into active forms, we identified the two separate elements that allosterically suppress otherwise constitutively active AR-Vs; one in exon 5 for v6es and v7es and the other in exon 8 for v56es.

The algorithm is designed to rank potential targets by maximizing a lesion-specific score, incorporating various criteria separated into two categories: (1) physician-feasibility category including physician-preferred lesion location and absolute volume scores, and (2) imaging-based category including various modality and application-specific metrics. This platform was benchmarked in two clinical scenarios, a pre-treatment setting and response-based setting using imaging from metastatic prostate cancer patients with high disease burden (multiple lesions) undergoing conventional treatment and receiving whole-body [18F]NaF PET/CT scans pre- and mid-treatment. Targeting of metastatic lesions was robust to different weighting ratios and candidacy for biopsy was physician confirmed. Lesion ranked as top targets for biopsy remained so for all patients in pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy selection after sensitivity testing was completed for physician-biased or imaging-biased scenarios. After identifying candidates, biopsy feasibility was evaluated by a physician and confirmed for 90% (32/36) of high-ranking lesions, of which all top choices were confirmed. The remaining cases represented lesions with high anatomical difficulty for targeting, such as proximity to sciatic nerve. This newly developed selection method was successfully used to quantitatively identify candidate lesions for biopsies in patients with multiple lesions.

PC-1/PrLZ, a TPD52 protein family member is frequently upregulated in advanced prostate cancer cells and may be a biomarker of aggressive prostate cancer. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of PC-1/PrLZ for increasing radioresistance in human prostate cancer cell lines. Growth curves and survival assays after g-ray irradiation confirmed that depletion of endogenous PC-1/PrLZ significantly increased prostate cancer cell radiosensitivity. Irradiation (IR) increased PC-1/PrLZ expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased radiosensitivity in PC-1/PrLZ-suppressed cells was partially due to decreased DNA double strand break (DBS) repair which was measured with comet and gH2AX foci assays.

This parameter, however, has not received significant attention in ultrasound elastography and, in general, in most diagnostic imaging modalities yet. In this paper, we investigate the effect of an underlying IFP contrast on ultrasound axial strain and axial shear strain imaging using finite element analysis.

Some suggest that active surveillance or less invasive therapies (brachytherapy or focal therapy) may be appropriate for some men with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 disease. Molecular markers may help further distinguish prostate cancers with aggressive behavior. We tested whether loss of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor in 3 + 4 = 7 tumor biopsies is associated with adverse pathology at prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We queried prostate needle biopsies from 2000 to 2014 with a maximum Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7 followed by prostatectomy. A total of 260 cases had PTEN status evaluable by clinical grade immunohistochemistry. Biopsy PTEN status was correlated with preoperative and postoperative clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   PTEN loss was detected in 27% of 3 + 4 = 7 biopsies. Loss of PTEN was less common in tumors of African American men compared to European American men (9% vs 31%, p = 0.002). At prostatectomy, tumors with PTEN loss were more likely to show nonorgan confined disease compared to those with PTEN intact (52% vs 27%, p <0.001). In logistic regression models including age, race, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage and biopsy tumor involvement, PTEN loss at biopsy remained significantly associated with an increased risk of nonorgan confined disease (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.34-4.49, p = 0.004). On ROC analysis, the AUC for models including prostate specific antigen and clinical stage was increased from 0.61 to 0.67 upon inclusion of PTEN status.  Conclusions:   PTEN loss in a Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 biopsy is independently associated with an increased risk of nonorgan confined disease at prostatectomy.

We evaluated the feasibility of hypofractionated dose-painting radiotherapy and the associated toxicity. The possibility to streamline a radiobiologically optimised planning protocol was also investigated.  Materials and methods:   Twenty-eight patients were treated using a dose-painting approach; boost volumes were identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The prostate dose outside the boost volume was 60 Gy in 20 fractions, and the maximum integrated boost dose was set to 68 Gy, provided that the dose constraints to the organs at risk could be fulfilled. Rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used with daily image guidance and fiducial markers.  Results:   The boost dose was escalated to 68 Gy for 25 patients (median dose 69 Gy, range 68-70 Gy); for three patients the boost dose was 67 Gy, due to the proximity of the urethra and/or the rectum. The mean normal tissue complication probability for rectal bleeding was 4.7% (range 3.4-5.8%) and was 3.5% for faecal incontinence (range 2.3-5.0%). At a median follow-up of 38 months (range 32-45) there was no grade 3 toxicity. Two patients developed grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (7.1%) and none developed grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. The mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for 23 patients who had stopped the adjuvant hormone therapy with a normal testosterone was 0.27 ng/ml (0.02-0.72) at follow-up; two patients have suppressed PSA and testosterone after stopping 3 year adjuvant hormone and three patients have relapsed (one pelvic node, two PSA only) at 36, 12 and 42 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   A hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule, 60 Gy in 20 fractions with intra-prostatic boost dose of 68 Gy, can be achieved without exceeding dose constraints for organs at risk. Hypofractionated dose-painting escalated radiotherapy has an acceptable safety profile.

Taxanes stabilize microtubules and may hence interfere with a plethora of cellular processes, most notably mitosis. However, prostate cancer is typically a slowly growing tumor suggesting that additional processes play a role in the response to taxanes.  Methods:   Here, we analyzed the potential effect of taxanes on microtubuli-dependent intracellular transport and signaling processes, specifically, nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor and modulation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade.  Results:   We show that the androgen-driven nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor remains virtually undisturbed by docetaxel in prostate cancer cells. However, we found a striking down-regulation of activated ERK1/2 together with enhanced cytotoxicity in both docetaxel or cabazitaxel-treated cells that was comparable to direct MEK kinase inhibition. Remarkably, MEK inhibition alone was less effective in inducing cytotoxicity than taxanes indicating that a down-regulation of activated ERK1/2 may be necessary but is not sufficient for taxane-induced antitumoral effects. In line with this notion, we show in a xenograft mouse model that prostate cancer cells that are resistant to docetaxel overexpress activated ERK1/2. Taken together, our findings underscore that the modulation of ERK1/2 activation, in concert with other mechanisms, plays an important role in taxane-induced antineoplastic effects on prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   These results suggest at least partially nonoverlapping effects of docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy and hence help to understand recent clinical findings. A further elucidation of the mode of action of docetaxel would have important implications to optimize current treatment strategies and biomarker development for men with metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Josef Mang', 'Konstanze Merkle', 'Martina Heller', 'Julia Schüler', 'Yanis Tolstov', 'Jielin Li', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Interaction between docetaxel resistance and castration resistance in prostate cancer: implications of Twist1, YB-1, and androgen receptor.', 'The Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway can mediate growth inhibitory and differentiation signaling via androgen receptor downregulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel-induced apoptosis of human melanoma is mediated by activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) Therapy Concomitant with Taxanes for Cancer Treatment.', 'Administering Docetaxel for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer 1-6 Days Compared to More Than 14 Days after the Start of LHRH Agonist Is Associated with Better Clinical Outcomes Due to Androgen Flare.', 'Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Expression profile-based screening for critical genes reveals S100A4, ACKR3 and CDH1 in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

Both nomograms were able to identify low- and high-risk subgroups within the cohort. Kattan nomogram demonstrated better correlation with the observed rate of progression over the first 3 biopsies and higher clinical net benefit.  Conclusion:   Kattan and Truong nomograms demonstrated the best performance in predicting biopsy progression, although their value was largely limited to the first 2 surveillance biopsies. Both tools were able to stratify patients into subgroups with different risks of progression. These nomograms have important differences, which suggest that a more effective predictive model combining the strong sides of both tools and possibly some other variables could be developed.""","""['Viacheslav Iremashvili', 'Murugesan Manoharan', 'Bruce R Kava', 'Dipen J Parekh', 'Sanoj Punnen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Cross-cultural validation of a prognostic tool: example of the Kattan preoperative nomogram as a predictor of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Improving risk stratification in patients with prostate cancer managed by active surveillance: a nomogram predicting the risk of biopsy progression.', 'Predictive models and prostate cancer.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'The role of diagnostic ultrasound imaging for patients with known prostate cancer within an active surveillance pathway: A systematic review.', 'A first step towards a global nomogram to predict disease progression for men on active surveillance.', 'Prostate Biopsy in Active Surveillance Protocols: Immediate Re-biopsy and Timing of Subsequent Biopsies.']"""

HDGF overexpression has also previously been correlated with a poor prognosis in several cancers. The significance of HDGF in prostate cancer, however, has not been investigated. Here, we show that HDGF is overexpressed in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive DU145, 22RV1, and PC-3 cells. Forced overexpression enhanced cell viability of RWPE-1 cells, whereas HDGF knockdown reduced cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cells. We also show that HDGF may serve as a survival-related protein as ectopic overexpression of HDGF in RWPE cells up-regulated the expression of antiapoptosis proteins cyclin E and BCL-2, whereas simultaneously down-regulating proapoptotic protein BAX. Western blot analysis also showed that HDGF overexpression modulated the activity of phospho-AKT as well as NF-kB, and these results correlated with in vitro migration and invasion assays. We next assessed the therapeutic potential of HDGF inhibition with a HDGF monoclonal antibody and vitamin k2, showing reduced cell proliferation as well as inhibition of NF-kB expression in HDGF overexpressed RWPE cells treated with a HDGF monoclonal antibody and vitamin K2. Collectively, our results suggest that HDGF is a relevant protein in prostate oncogenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.""","""['Aditya Shetty', 'Subramanyam Dasari', 'Souresh Banerjee', 'Taher Gheewala', 'Guoxing Zheng', 'Aoshuang Chen', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Downregulated expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor inhibits migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MMP2, MMP9.', 'Various effects of hepatoma-derived growth factor on cell growth, migration and invasion of breast cancer and prostate cancer cells.', 'Enhanced antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on prostate cancer cells by simultaneously inhibiting androgen receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.', 'Cellular and molecular biology of the prostate: stem cell biology.', 'Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor: An Overview and Its Role as a Potential Therapeutic Target Molecule for Digestive Malignancies.', 'BLM promotes malignancy in PCa by inducing KRAS expression and RhoA suppression via its interaction with HDGF and activation of MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'Small Extracellular Vesicles and Their Involvement in Cancer Resistance: An Up-to-Date Review.', 'Extracellular vesicle proteomic analysis leads to the discovery of HDGF as a new factor in multiple myeloma biology.', 'The Subventricular Zone in Glioblastoma: Genesis, Maintenance, and Modeling.', 'MicroRNA-939 Directly Targets HDGF to Inhibit the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer via Deactivation of the WNT/β-Catenin Pathway.']"""

Overall survival (OS) was calculated from start of therapy using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards were calculated to estimate the effect of clinical variables on OS.  Results:   OS was longer in patients treated with ≥ 9 cycles of docetaxel (21.9 months vs. 17.2 months; P < .0001, log rank).

However, evidence and experience are still limited, and this may lead to clinically relevant differences in accessibility, interpretation and decision making. We investigated the current patterns of care in functional imaging for radiotherapy in the Netherlands in a care evaluation study.  Materials and methods:   The availability of functional imaging in radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands was evaluated; features available in >80% of academic and >80% of non-academic centres were considered standard of care. The impact of functional imaging on clinical decision making was evaluated using case questionnaires on lung, head/neck, breast and prostate cancer, with multiple-choice questions on primary tumour delineation, nodal involvement, distant metastasis and incidental findings. Radiation oncologists were allowed to discuss cases in a multidisciplinary approach. Ordinal answers were evaluated by median and interquartile range (IQR) to identify the extent and variability of clinical impact; additional patterns were evaluated descriptively.  Results:   Information was collected from 18 radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands (all except two). PET/CT was available for radiotherapy purposes to 94% of centres; 67% in the treatment position and 61% with integrated planning CT. mpMR was available to all centres; 61% in the treatment position. Technologists collaborated between departments to acquire PET/CT or mpMR for radiotherapy in 89%. All sites could carry out image registration for target definition. Functional imaging generally showed a high clinical impact (average median 4.3, scale 1-6) and good observer agreement (average IQR 1.1, scale 0-6). However, several issues resulted in ignoring functional imaging (e.g. positional discrepancies, central necrosis) or poor observer agreement (atelectasis, diagnostic discrepancies, conformation strategies).  Conclusions:   Access to functional imaging with PET/CT and mpMR for radiotherapy purposes, with collaborating technologists and multimodal delineation, can be considered standard of care in the Netherlands. For several specific clinical situations, the interpretation of images may benefit from further standardisation.""","""['W V Vogel', 'M G E H Lam', 'F A Pameijer', 'U A van der Heide', 'J B van de Kamer', 'M E Philippens', 'M van Vulpen', 'M Verheij']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Variabilities of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-, Computed Tomography-, and Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography-Based Tumor and Lymph Node Delineations for Lung Cancer Radiation Therapy Planning.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Positron emission tomography with computed tomography imaging (PET/CT) for the radiotherapy planning definition of the biological target volume: PART 1.', 'Patterns of care survey: Radiotherapy for women with locally advanced cervical cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography with computed tomography imaging (PET/CT) for the radiotherapy planning definition of the biological target volume: PART 2.', 'Molecular imaging as biomarker for treatment response and outcome in breast cancer.', 'Improving radiation physics, tumor visualisation, and treatment quantification in radiotherapy with spectral or dual-energy CT.', 'Trimodality PET/CT/MRI and Radiotherapy: A Mini-Review.', 'Uncertainty evaluation of image-based tumour control probability models in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using a visual analytic tool.', 'Simultaneous Metabolic and Perfusion Imaging Using Hyperpolarized 13C MRI Can Evaluate Early and Dose-Dependent Response to Radiation Therapy in a Prostate Cancer Mouse Model.']"""

Materials and methods:   We downloaded from PubMed the title, abstract, and medical subject heading terms for 10,065 articles published in 25 general radiology journals in 2012 and 2013. Three machine-learning models were applied to predict the top 10% of included articles in terms of the number of citations to the article in 2014 (reflecting the 2-year time window in conventional impact factor calculations). The model having the highest area under the curve was selected to derive a list of article features (words) predicting high citation volume, which was iteratively reduced to identify the smallest possible core feature list maintaining predictive power. Overall themes were qualitatively assigned to the core features.  Results:   The regularized logistic regression (Bayesian binary regression) model had highest performance, achieving an area under the curve of 0.814 in predicting articles in the top 10% of citation volume. We reduced the initial 14,083 features to 210 features that maintain predictivity. These features corresponded with topics relating to various imaging techniques (eg, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy computed tomography, computed tomography reconstruction algorithms, tomosynthesis, elastography, and computer-aided diagnosis), particular pathologies (prostate cancer; thyroid nodules; hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), and other topics (radiation dose, electroporation, education, general oncology, gadolinium, statistics).

Multivariable logistic and linear models addressed the effect of each specific LTA approach on overall complication rates, length of stay, readmission rates and health care expenditures.  Results:   The 30-day mortality was <2% after either LTA or PN (OR 2.27, p = 0.2). The overall complication rate was 21% after LTA and 40% after PN (OR 0.38, p < 0.001). Blood transfusions, infection/sepsis, wound infections, respiratory complications, gastrointestinal complications, acute kidney injury, and accidental puncture or laceration/foreign body left during procedure rates resulted lower after LTA relative to PN (all p < 0.05). Similarly, length of stay and health care expenditures resulted lower after LTA relative to PN (all p < 0.05).

In nanobody-based cancer diagnosis and treatment, nanobodies with high affinity toward receptor (e.g. EGFR) results in effective treatment or diagnosis of cancer. In this regard, the main aim of this study is to develop a method based on molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for designing of 7D12 based nanobody with high affinity compared with wild-type nanobody. By surveying electrostatic and desolvation interactions between different residues of 7D12 and EGFR, the critical residues of 7D12 that play the main role in the binding of 7D12 to EGFR were elucidated and based on these residues, five logical variants were designed. Following the 50 ns MD simulations, pull and umbrella sampling simulation were performed for 7D12 and all its variants in complex with EGFR. Binding free energy of 7D12 (and all its variants) with EGFR was obtained by weighted histogram analysis method. According to binding free energy results, GLY101 to GLU mutation showed the highest binding affinity but this variant is unstable after 50 ns MD simulations. ALA100 to GLU mutation shows suitable binding enhancement with acceptable structural stability. Suitable position and orientation of GLU in residue 100 of 7D12 against related amino acids of EGFR formed some extra hydrogen and electrostatic interactions which resulted in binding enhancement.""","""['Alireza Farasat', 'Fatemeh Rahbarizadeh', 'Ghader Hosseinzadeh', 'Sharareh Sajjadi', 'Mehdi Kamali', 'Amir Homayoun Keihan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biomol Struct Dyn""","""['Role of N-glycosylation in EGFR ectodomain ligand binding.', 'Nanobody Targeting of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Ectodomain Variants Overcomes Resistance to Therapeutic EGFR Antibodies.', 'An integrated computational pipeline for designing high-affinity nanobodies with expanded genetic codes.', 'Structural and Computational Studies of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding Mechanisms with Nanobodies: From Structure and Dynamics to Avidity-Driven Nanobody Engineering.', 'Anti-EGFR Binding Nanobody Delivery System to Improve the Diagnosis and Treatment of Solid Tumours.', 'In silico approach to probe the binding affinity between OMVs harboring the ZEGFR affibody and the EGF receptor.', 'Effects of unsaturated fatty acids (Arachidonic/Oleic Acids) on stability and structural properties of Calprotectin using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach.', 'Study of HSA interactions with arachidonic acid using spectroscopic methods revealing molecular dynamics of HSA-AA interactions.', 'A Nanobody Against Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Antigen-4 Increases the Anti-Tumor Effects of Specific CD8+ T Cells.', 'In silico assessment of human Calprotectin subunits (S100A8/A9) in presence of sodium and calcium ions using Molecular Dynamics simulation approach.']"""

CDO1 methylation and mRNA expression were determined in cell lines and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy specimens from a first cohort of 300 PCa patients using methylation-specific qPCR and qRT-PCR. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to evaluate biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival.

TXA2 signals through two T Prostanoid receptor (TP) isoforms termed TPα and TPβ, with both encoded by the TBXA2R gene. Despite exhibiting several functional and regulatory differences, the role of the individual TP isoforms in neoplastic diseases is largely unknown.This study evaluated expression of the TPα and TPβ isoforms in tumour microarrays of the benign prostate and different pathological (Gleason) grades of prostate cancer (PCa). Expression of TPβ was significantly increased in PCa relative to benign tissue and strongly correlated with increasing Gleason grade. Furthermore, higher TPβ expression was associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and significantly shorter disease-free survival time in patients post-surgery. While TPα was more variably expressed than TPβ in PCa, increased/high TPα expression within the tumour also trended toward increased BCR and shorter disease-free survival time. Comparative genomic CpG DNA methylation analysis revealed substantial differences in the extent of methylation of the promoter regions of the TBXA2R that specifically regulate expression of TPα and TPβ, respectively, both in benign prostate and in clinically-derived tissue representative of precursor lesions and progressive stages of PCa. Collectively, TPα and TPβ expression is differentially regulated both in the benign and tumourigenic prostate, and coincides with clinical pathology and altered CpG methylation of the TBXA2R gene. Analysis of TPβ, or a combination of TPα/TPβ, expression levels may have significant clinical potential as a diagnostic biomarker and predictor of PCa disease recurrence.""","""['Eamon P Mulvaney', 'Christine Shilling', 'Sarah B Eivers', 'Antoinette S Perry', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Elaine W Kay', 'R William Watson', 'B Therese Kinsella']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Regulated expression of the TPβ isoform of the human T prostanoid receptor by the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1: Implications for the role of thromboxane in prostate cancer.', 'Differential expression of the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human T Prostanoid receptor during chronic inflammation of the prostate: Role for FOXP1 in the transcriptional regulation of TPβ during monocyte-macrophage differentiation.', 'Regulation of protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) signalling by the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human thromboxane A2 receptor: Implications for thromboxane- and androgen- dependent neoplastic and epigenetic responses in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of the Human Thromboxane A2 Receptor Gene by Wilms’ Tumour (WT)1.', 'Thromboxane A2: physiology/pathophysiology, cellular signal transduction and pharmacology.', 'The thromboxane receptor antagonist NTP42 promotes beneficial adaptation and preserves cardiac function in experimental models of right heart overload.', 'The Role and Regulation of Thromboxane A2 Signaling in Cancer-Trojan Horses and Misdirection.', 'Prostanoid Signaling in Cancers: Expression and Regulation Patterns of Enzymes and Receptors.', 'Antiplatelet Agents Affecting GPCR Signaling Implicated in Tumor Metastasis.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.']"""

However, how they contribute to neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is not fully understood. Using bioinformatics and biochemical approaches to analyze cell-based models of NED and CRPC, we found a cluster of epigenetic factors whose expression is downregulated during NED and upregulated in CRPC (i.e. follow a Down-Up pattern). Two histone demethylases within this cluster, PHF8 and KDM3A, are post-transcriptionally regulated by c-MYC through miR-22, which targets both PHF8 and KDM3A. We also found that the c-MYC/miR-22/PHF8 axis is downstream of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in CRPC cells. The co-expression of PHF8 with AR in clinical CRPC samples, normal mouse prostate, and adenocarcinomas of the prostate during PCa progression in a transgenic (TRAMP) mouse model supports the connection between PHF8 and AR. Knockdown of PHF8 impedes cell cycle progression in CRPC cells and has more profound effects on their growth than on the parental LNCaP cell line. Furthermore, PHF8 knockdown sensitizes LNCaP-Abl cells to the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Our data reveal novel mechanisms that underlie the regulation of PHF8 and KDM3A during NED and in CRPC, and support the candidacy of PHF8 as a therapeutic target in CRPC.""","""['Peterson Kariuki Maina', 'Peng Shao', 'Qi Liu', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Scott Tyler', 'Moman Nasir', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Hank Heng Qi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Histone demethylase PHF8 regulates hypoxia signaling through HIF1α and H3K4me3.', 'Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systematic knockdown of epigenetic enzymes identifies a novel histone demethylase PHF8 overexpressed in prostate cancer with an impact on cell proliferation, migration and invasion.', 'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'An Immunocompetent Environment Unravels the Proto-Oncogenic Role of miR-22.', 'KDM3A-mediated SP1 activates PFKFB4 transcription to promote aerobic glycolysis in osteosarcoma and augment tumor development.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, drug resistance can emerge after a series of treatments, and this can seriously affect the patient's prognosis. Here, we analyzed the mechanism of PTX resistance using a human prostate cancer cell line, PC3, and its PTX-resistant subline, PC3-PR. Compared with PC3, PC3-PR exhibited some unique phenotypes that might be associated with PTX resistance, including decreased expression of acetylated α-tubulin and the cell cycle regulator p21, and increased expression of βIII tubulin, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. The drug exporters MDR1 and MRP1 were not involved in PTX resistance. Although cabazitaxel (CTX), a novel taxoid, has been reported to overcome PTX resistance, its mechanism of action is unknown. We found that treatment of PC3-PR cells with CTX induced expression of acetylated α-tubulin and p21, but not the related regulators p27, p15, and p16 or the Bcl2 family proteins. The pan-HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and suberanilohydroxamic acid and the HDAC6-specific inhibitor tubacin inhibited PC3-PR proliferation and increased expression of p21 and acetylated α-tubulin in a manner similar to CTX.

Three methods of fusing MRI for targeted biopsy have been recently described: MRI-ultrasound fusion, MRI-MRI fusion ('in-bore' biopsy) and cognitive fusion. Fusion of MRI with ultrasound allows urologists to progress from blind, systematic biopsies to biopsies, which are mapped, targeted and tracked.

Methods: The clinical parameters of 39 patients who underwent transvesical single-site laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in Department of Urology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from November 2010 to June 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The age was (M(QR)) 64 (10) years (range 47 to 70 years). The median preoperative serum total prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.9 (2.9) μg/L (range 4.2 to 9.8 μg/L). The clinical TNM stage comprised 24 cases of cT1c and 15 cases of cT2a. All the transrectal biopsy Gleason score ≤6. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was (21.7±1.6) points (range 18 to 24 points). The surgical procedures were performed through single-site transvesical approach. The postoperative serum PSA was regularly detected. The continence status were recorded at 1st month, 3rd month and 6th month after catheter removal, and the potencies were evaluated at 3rd month, 6th month and 12th month postoperative, respectively. Results: All the operations were successfully performed and there was no intraoperative complication or conversion to standard laparoscopic approach. The operation duration was (105±26) minuetes, the estimated blood loss was (100±56) ml and no blood transfusion was required. The pathological TNM stage comprised 30 cases of pT2a and 9 cases of pT2b, the Gleason score all ≤6 and no patient had positive surgical margins. The duration of urinary catheterization was (11.6±1.4) days and hospital stay was (12.9±4.3) days. The continence rates were 84.6%, 97.4%, 100% at 1st month, 3rd month and 6th month after catheter removal, respectively. The potency rates were 48.7%, 64.1%, 76.9% at 3rd month, 6th month and 12th month postoperative, respectively, with an IIEF-5 score≥18. Two cases demonstrated biochemical recurrence and one case presented vesico-urethral stricture during an average follow-up of 39 months (range 12 to 60 months).

These irAEs are often low grade and manageable, but severe irAEs may lead to prolonged hospitalizations or fatalities. Early intervention is necessary to minimize morbidities that occur with severe irAEs. However, correlative biomarkers are currently lacking. In a phase II clinical trial that treated 27 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, we aimed to test the safety and efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy plus ipilimumab. In this study, we observed grade 3 toxicities in >40% of treated patients, which led to early closure of the study. Because ipilimumab enhances T-cell responses, we hypothesized that increased clonal T-cell responses in the systemic circulation may contribute to irAEs. Sequencing of the T-cell receptor β-chains in purified T cells revealed clonal expansion of CD8 T cells, which occurred in blood samples collected before the onset of grade 2-3 irAEs. These initial results suggested that expansion of ≥55 CD8 T-cell clones preceded the development of severe irAEs. We further evaluated available blood samples from a second trial and determined that patients who experienced grade 2-3 irAEs also had expansion of ≥55 CD8 T-cell clones in blood samples collected before the onset of irAEs.

Methods:   Five designs were selected for testing: 18-gauge Bard, 15-gauge lancet tip needle with 12° vet-point cannula, and trocar tip needle with 12°, 15°, and 20° vet-point cannulas. The 15-gauge needle was designed to take a variable specimen sample between 20 and 60 mm, whereas the Bard needle specimen bed was fixed at 20 mm. The needles were bench tested on a spring-loaded platform and fired into gelatin matrix with modulus of elasticity similar to human prostate.  Results:   The Bard device with lancet tip needle deflected an average of 0.9 mm (range 0.3-1.3 mm) and 1.9° (range 0.6°-2.8°). Increasing needle diameter from 18-gauge Bard to 15-gauge variable with the same lancet tip needle design resulted in an average deflection across the 3 test lengths of 0.9 mm (range 0-2.0 mm) and 0.9° (range 0°-2.0°) with no significant difference. On the contrary, the use of the 3-point trocar tip needles with 12°, 15°, and 20° vet-point cannulas demonstrated significant reduction in the extent of deflection in both millimeters and degrees. There was no deflection at the 2- and 4-cm shots for both spring loads and preloads for the 3 vet tip angles tested. At 6 cm, the 20° vet tip performed the best.  Conclusion:   We proposed a mechanism that provides more accurate prostate sampling by combining a 3-point trocar tip on the needle with a 20° vet tip on the cutting cannula.

Here, we evaluated the activity of a novel allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor, BAY 1125976, in biochemical, cellular mechanistic, functional and in vivo efficacy studies in a variety of tumor models. In in vitro kinase activity assays, BAY 1125976 potently and selectively inhibited the activity of full-length AKT1 and AKT2 by binding into an allosteric binding pocket formed by kinase and PH domain. In accordance with this proposed allosteric binding mode, BAY 1125976 bound to inactive AKT1 and inhibited T308 phosphorylation by PDK1, while the activity of truncated AKT proteins lacking the pleckstrin homology domain was not inhibited. In vitro, BAY 1125976 inhibited cell proliferation in a broad panel of human cancer cell lines. Particularly high activity was observed in breast and prostate cancer cell lines expressing estrogen or androgen receptors. Furthermore, BAY 1125976 exhibited strong in vivo efficacy in both cell line and patient-derived xenograft models such as the KPL4 breast cancer model (PIK3CAH1074R mutant), the MCF7 and HBCx-2 breast cancer models and the AKTE17K mutant driven prostate cancer (LAPC-4) and anal cancer (AXF 984) models.

The function of BET family member BRD4 at enhancers/superenhancers has been shown to sustain signal-dependent or pathogenic gene expression programs. Here, the hypothesis was tested that the transcription factor drivers of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) clinical progression, including the androgen receptor (AR), are critically dependent on BRD4 and thus represent a sensitive solid tumor indication for the BET inhibitor ABBV-075. DHT-stimulated transcription of AR target genes was inhibited by ABBV-075 without significant effect on AR protein expression. Furthermore, ABBV-075 disrupted DHT-stimulated recruitment of BET family member BRD4 to gene-regulatory regions cooccupied by AR, including the well-established PSA and TMPRSS2 enhancers. Persistent BET inhibition disrupted the composition and function of AR-occupied enhancers as measured by a reduction in AR and H3K27Ac ChIP signal and inhibition of enhancer RNA transcription. ABBV-075 displayed potent antiproliferative activity in multiple models of resistance to second-generation antiandrogens and inhibited the activity of the AR splice variant AR-V7 and ligand-binding domain gain-of-function mutations, F877L and L702H.

TIC can be distinguished from epithelial and stromal cells that comprise prostate tissue via cell sorting based upon Epcam, CD44, and CD49f antigenic profiles. Fetal prostate epithelial cells (FC) possess a similar antigenic profile to adult TIC and are capable of inducing tubule formation. To identify the TIC niche in human prostate tissue, differential keratin (KRT) expression was evaluated.  Results:   Gene expression data generated from Affymetrix Gene Chip human U133 Plus 2.0 array of sorted adult and fetal epithelial cells revealed KRT13 to be significantly enriched in FC and TIC compared to basal cells (BC) and luminal cells (LC) (p<0.001). Enriched KRT13 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and cytospin immunostaining. Immunohistochemical analysis of KRT13 expression revealed rare KRT13+ epithelia throughout prostatic ducts/acini in adult tissue specimens and differentiated tubules in 24-week recombinant grafts, In contrast, abundant KRT13 expression was observed in developing ducts/acini in fetal prostate and cord-like structures composing 8-week recombinant grafts. Immunostaining of a prostate tissue microarray revealed KRT13+ tumor foci in approximately 9% of cases, and this subset displayed significantly shorter time to recurrence (p = 0.031), metastases (p = 0.032), and decreased overall survival (p = 0.004). Diagnostic prostate needle biopsies (PNBX) from untreated patients with concurrent bone metastases (clinical stage M1) displayed KRT13+ tumor foci, as did bone metastatic foci.  Conclusions:   The expression profile of KRT13 in benign fetal and adult prostate tissue and in recombinant grafts, as well as the frequency of KRT13 expression in primary and metastatic prostate cancer indicates that it may be a marker of a stem/progenitor-like cell state that is co-opted in aggressive tumor cells. KRT13 is enriched in benign stem-like cells that display androgen-resistance, apoptosis-resistance, and branching morphogenesis properties.

Patients (pts) generally experience significant pain during the procedure at the point that biopsy should be accompanied by some form of anesthesia. Several different factors influence pain perception (PP) during TRUS-Bx. In our study we want to assess that the use of an ergonomic smaller sized probe reduces PP during the procedure independently from the administration of local anesthesia or pain relieving drugs.  Materials and methods:   This was a prospective, randomized study in which 114 pts who underwent TRUS-Bx due to abnormal PSA and/or to digital rectal examination (DRE) suspicious findings were considered eligible. Pts were split in two TRUS-Bx groups into which we used two different sized ultrasound probes. In group 1, 61 pts underwent TRUS-Bx with ALOKA end fire probe (size 74 mm). In group 2, 53 pts underwent TRUS-Bx with B-K Type 8818 probe (size 58 mm). Both groups were treated with no local anesthesia or pain relieving drugs. Pain was evaluated three times using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), during the DRE (VAS 1), during the insertion of the probe (VAS 2) and during the needle piercing (VAS 3).  Results:   Mean age of pts was 68.03 (SD 8.51); mean tPSA and mean prostate volume was 7.75 (SD 4.83) and 45.17cc (SD 17.7), respectively. The two groups were homogeneous respect to tPSA (p = 0.675) and to prostate volume (p = 0.296); age was significantly different (p = 0.04) between Group 1 (65.93) and Group 2 (70.43), whereas no statistically significant correlation between VAS 3 and age was observed (p = 0.179). Analyzing pain perception, we found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in DRE (VAS 1; p = 0.839); on the contrary, patients in Group 1 experienced on average more pain than other in Group 2 both during the insertion of the probe (VAS 2 3.49 vs 1.09; p &lt; 0.001) and during the needle piercing VAS 3 (2.8 vs 2.00; p &lt; 0.05). The discomfort during probe insertion and manipulation was perceived as very high (VAS 2 &gt; 5) in 42.6% of patients in Group 1 and in 9.4% in Group 2. Globally, the procedure was well tolerated (mean VAS score &lt; 3) in 77% of patients in Group 1 and in 90% in Group 2. The proportion of patients who experienced more than moderate pain (VAS &gt; 5) during needle piercing ranged 24.6 % in Group 1 to 18.9 % in Group 2.

Phosphonioalkylthiosulfate zwitterions, and ω-thioacetylalkylphosphonium salts, which act as 'masked thiolate' ligands, are useful precursors for the formation of phosphonium-functionalised gold nanoparticles, enabling the nanoparticles to be transported into cells for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this study we have completed cytotoxicity studies of ω-thioacetylpropylphosphonium salts derived from triphenylphosphine and tri(4-fluorophenyl)phosphine, which show that the compounds are only toxic towards PC3 prostate cancer cells at high concentrations and at prolonged incubation periods and display IC50 values of 67 μM and 252 μM respectively, significantly higher than those of other phosphonium salts. MALDI-TOF-MS has been used to investigate the uptake of the compounds by PC3 cells and to quantify detectable levels of the compounds inside the cells. The structures of ω-thioacetylpropyl(tri-4-fluorophenyl) phosphonium bromide and the corresponding tri(4-fluorophenyl)phosphoniopropylthiosulfate zwitterion have been investigated by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The results show that molecules of the zwitterion are held together through an extensive array of electrostatic and non-covalent interactions. The unit cell of ω-thioacetylpropyl(tri-4-fluorophenyl)phosphonium bromide contains eight cations together with eight bromide anions and two waters of crystallisation, all held together through a complex network of hydrogen bonds.

The purpose of this research was to use high risk prostate cancer as a clinical example to evaluate a 'compromise' image alignment strategy.  Methods:   The daily pre-treatment orthogonal EPI for 14 consecutive patients were included in this analysis. Image matching was performed by aligning to the prostate only, the bony pelvis only and using the 'compromise' strategy. Residual CTV surrogate displacements were quantified for each of the alignment strategies.  Results:   Analysis of the 388 daily fractions indicated surrogate displacements were well-correlated in all directions (r2 = 0.95 (LR), 0.67 (AP) and 0.59 (SI). Differences between the surrogates displacements (95% range) were -0.4 to 1.8 mm (LR), -1.2 to 5.2 mm (SI) and -1.2 to 5.2 mm (AP). The distribution of the residual displacements was significantly smaller using the 'compromise' strategy, compared to the other strategies (p 0.005). The 'compromise' strategy ensured the CTV was encompassed by the PTV in all fractions, compared to 47 PTV violations when aligned to prostate only.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the feasibility of a compromise position image guidance strategy to accommodate simultaneous displacements of two independently moving CTVs. Application of this strategy was facilitated by correlation between the CTV displacements and resulted in no geometric excursions of the CTVs beyond standard sized PTVs. This simple image guidance strategy may also be applicable to other disease sites that concurrently irradiate multiple CTVs, such as head and neck, lung and cervix cancer.""","""['Tara Rosewall', 'Jing Yan', 'Hamideh Alasti', 'Carla Cerase', 'Andrew Bayley']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Patient positioning using in-room kV CT for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric effects of the prone and supine positions on image guided localized prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Assessment of planning target volume margins for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the prostate gland: role of daily inter- and intrafraction motion.', 'Clinical application of high-dose, image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: Analysis of interfractional errors and acute toxicity.', 'An IGRT margin concept for pelvic lymph nodes in high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Aberrant DNA methylation as a common molecular alteration in PCa seems to be a promising source for such biomarkers. In this study, PITX3 DNA methylation (mPITX3) and its potential role as a prognostic biomarker were investigated. Furthermore, mPITX3 was analyzed in combination with the established PCa methylation biomarker PITX2 (mPITX2).  Methods: mPITX3 and mPITX2 were assessed by a quantitative real-time PCR and by means of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. BeadChip data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. DNA methylation differences between normal adjacent, benign hyperplastic, and carcinomatous prostate tissues were examined in the TCGA dataset as well as in prostatectomy specimens from the University Hospital Bonn. Retrospective analyses of biochemical recurrence (BCR) were conducted in a training cohort (n = 498) from the TCGA and an independent validation cohort (n = 300) from the University Hospital Bonn. All patients received radical prostatectomy.  Results:   In PCa tissue, mPITX3 was increased significantly compared to normal and benign hyperplastic tissue. In univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, mPITX3 showed a significant prognostic value for BCR (training cohort: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.83 (95 % CI 1.07-3.11), p = 0.027; validation cohort: HR = 2.56 (95 % CI 1.44-4.54), p = 0.001). A combined evaluation with PITX2 methylation further revealed that hypermethylation of a single PITX gene member (either PITX2 or PITX3) identifies an intermediate risk group.  Conclusions: PITX3 DNA methylation alone and in combination with PITX2 is a promising biomarker for the risk stratification of PCa patients and adds relevant prognostic information to common clinically implemented parameters. Further studies are required to determine whether the results are transferable to a biopsy-based patient cohort.

We set to evaluate the utility of DNA methylation to identify high risk disease in men currently considered as low or intermediate risk. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transurethral prostate resection tissues collected during the years 1990-96 in a watchful-waiting cohort of men in the UK. The primary end point was death of prostate cancer, assessed by reviewing cancer registry records from 2009. Methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing assays for six genes (HSPB1, CCND2, TIG1, DPYS, PITX2, and MAL) with established biomarker value in prostate cancer. A novel prognostic methylation score was developed by multivariate Cox modelling using the six methylation biomarkers in 385 men with low-and-intermediate clinical risk variables and its prognostic value compared to two previously defined clinically-derived risk scores. Methylation score was the most significant variable in univariate and bivariate analysis in men with low-to-intermediate CAPRA risk score. When combined with CAPRA score the hazard ratio was 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-2.92. For a methylation score sensitivity of 83% the specificity was 44%, while the maximum achieved sensitivity by CAPRA was 68% at a specificity of 44%. The derived methylation score is a strong predictor of aggressive prostate cancer that could have an important role in directing the management of patients with low-to-intermediate risk disease.

This study aimed to identify potential protein markers and signaling pathways associated with radioresistance using a PC-3 radioresistant (RR) subcutaneous xenograft mouse model and verify the radiosensitization effect from a selected potential candidate. PC-3RR and PC-3 xenograft tumors were established and differential protein expression profiles from two groups of xenografts were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. One selected glycolysis marker, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) was validated, and further investigated for its role in CaP radioresistance. We found that 378 proteins and 51 pathways were significantly differentially expressed between PC-3RR and PC-3 xenograft tumors, and that the glycolysis pathway is closely linked with CaP radioresistance. In addition, we also demonstrated that knock down of LDHA with siRNA or inhibition of LDHA activity with a LDHA specific inhibitor (FX-11), could sensitize PC-3RR cells to radiotherapy with reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, DNA repair ability and autophagy, as well as increased DNA double strand breaks and apoptosis. In summary, we identified a list of potential RR protein markers and important signaling pathways from a PC-3RR xenograft mouse model, and demonstrate that targeting LDHA combined with radiotherapy could increase radiosensitivity in RR CaP cells, suggesting that LDHA is an ideal therapeutic target to develop combination therapy for overcoming CaP radioresistance.""","""['Jingli Hao', 'Peter Graham', 'Lei Chang', 'Jie Ni', 'Valerie Wasinger', 'Julia Beretov', 'Junli Deng', 'Wei Duan', 'Joseph Bucci', 'David Malouf', 'David Gillatt', 'Yong Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Identification of protein biomarkers and signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer radioresistance using label-free LC-MS/MS proteomic approach.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is involved in prostate cancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy response in vivo.', 'Lactate dehydrogenase 5 isoenzyme overexpression defines resistance of prostate cancer to radiotherapy.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Unappreciated Role of LDHA and LDHB to Control Apoptosis and Autophagy in Tumor Cells.', ""New horizons in modulating the radio-sensitivity of head and neck cancer - 100 years after Warburg' effect discovery."", 'Mitochondria Dysfunction-Mediated Molecular Subtypes and Gene Prognostic Index for Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy.', 'Application of Proteomics in the Discovery of Radiosensitive Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Triple Isozyme Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase Inhibition in Fully Viable MDA-MB-231 Cells Induces Cytostatic Effects That Are Not Reversed by Exogenous Lactic Acid.', 'Cell Metabolism and DNA Repair Pathways: Implications for Cancer Therapy.']"""

In the present study, a set of cationic polyprenyl derivatives [trimethylpolyprenylammonium iodides (PTAI)] with different lengths of polyprenyl chains (from 7, 8 and 11 to 15 isoprene units) was suggested as a component of efficient DNA vehicles.  Methods:   Optimization studies were conducted for PTAI in combination with co-lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine on DU145 human prostate cancer cells using: size and zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy, the fluorescein diacetate/ethidium bromide test, cell counting, time-lapse monitoring of cell movement, gap junctional intercellular coupling analysis, antimicrobial activity assay and a red blood cell hemolysis test.  Results:   The results obtained show that the lipofecting activity of PTAI allows effective transfection of plasmid DNA complexed in negatively-charged lipoplexes of 200-500 nm size into cells without significant side effects on cell physiology (viability, proliferation, morphology, migration and gap junctional intercellular coupling). Moreover, PTAI-based vehicles exhibit a potent bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The developed anionic lipoplexes are safe towards human red blood cell membranes, which are not disrupted in their presence.  Conclusions:   The developed carriers constitute a group of promising lipofecting agents of a new type that can be utilized as effective lipofecting agents in vitro and they are also an encouraging basis for in vivo applications.""","""['Monika Rak', 'Anna Ochałek', 'Ewa Bielecka', 'Joanna Latasiewicz', 'Katarzyna Gawarecka', 'Jolanta Sroka', 'Jarosław Czyż', 'Katarzyna Piwowarczyk', 'Marek Masnyk', 'Marek Chmielewski', 'Tadeusz Chojnacki', 'Ewa Swiezewska', 'Zbigniew Madeja']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Gene Med""","""['Polyprenol-Based Lipofecting Agents for In Vivo Delivery of Therapeutic DNA to Treat Hypertensive Rats.', 'Boost of serum resistance and storage stability in cationic polyprenyl-based lipofection by helper lipids compositions.', 'Lipofection-Based Delivery of DNA Vaccines.', 'Improved in vitro gene transfer mediated by fluorinated lipoplexes in the presence of a bile salt surfactant.', 'Ca(2+)-mediated anionic lipid-plasmid DNA lipoplexes.

However, the roles of IL6 and mutations of its corresponding gene in prostate cancer have not been clearly documented. We retrieved data from the Oncomine database concerning IL6 expression in prostate cancer and its role in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence. We also performed a case-control study of the IL6 -572G/C polymorphism (rs1800796) in 236 sporadic prostate cancer patients and 256 healthy controls from a southern Han Chinese population. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association between rs1800796 and prostate cancer susceptibility. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to test the transcriptional activity of the IL6 promoter G and C alleles. IL6 was overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, especially in those with higher Gleason scores. Moreover, elevated IL6 expression was associated with high PSA recurrence rate in Oncomine data. Our case-control study demonstrated that compared with the -572C allele, the -572G allele conferred a borderline increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 0.99-1.74, P = 0.061). This was more pronounced in the subgroup of individuals having never smoked (OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.07-3.22). Moreover, the G allele showed increased activity relative to the C allele in the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our results suggest that the -572G/C polymorphism may be associated with IL6 expression, which in turn plays a role in prostate cancer development.""","""['W J Huang', 'L J Wu', 'Z C Min', 'L T Xu', 'C M Guo', 'Z P Chen', 'X J Lou', 'B Xu', 'B D Lv']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Genet Mol Res""","""['Study on linkage between polymorphism of interleukin 6 gene -572C/G and susceptibility to myocardial infarction.', 'Role of interleukin-6 gene polymorphisms in the development of prostate cancer.', 'Association between IL6 polymorphism and risk of cerebral infarction.', 'Association of the interleukin-6 gene -572G/C polymorphism with cancer risk: a meta-analysis.', 'Association between HIF1A rs11549465 polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Increased expression of interleukin-6 gene in gastritis and gastric cancer.', 'Statistical meta-analysis to investigate the association between the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene polymorphisms and cancer risk.', 'IL-4/IL-4R and IL-6/IL-6R genetic variations and gastric cancer risk in the Chinese population.', 'Association of interleukin-6 polymorphisms with obesity or metabolic traits in young Mexican-Americans.']"""

In total, 193 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: PCa (78), benign prostate hyperplasia (40), and control males (75). The parameters assessed included body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, presence of prostatism, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason scores of prostate specimens, as well as polymorphisms in eNOS-G894T, CAT- 262T, and MPO G-463T genes. BMI and smoking status of controls and patient groups showed no significant difference. CAT-262T gene polymorphism was found to be homozygous in 35.4% of PCa patients, which was 4.02-fold that in the controls (P = 0.006). There was no statistically significant difference in eNOS-G894T and MPO G-463T gene polymorphisms between any of the groups. In conclusion, we found catalase levels to be associated with PCa diagnosis and PSA value.

Previous study established its antitumor and antimetastatic activity against prostate cancer models. The activity of BIRM against human prostate cancer (PCa) cells was investigated to uncover its mechanism of antitumor activity. In androgen receptor (AR)-expressing PCa cells BIRM was 2.5-fold (250%) more cytotoxic in presence of androgen (DHT) compared to cells grown in the absence of DHT. In AR-positive cells (LAPC-4 and LNCaP) BIRM caused a dose and time-dependent down-regulation of AR and increased apoptosis. Exposing cells to BIRM did not affect the synthesis of AR and AR promoter activity but increased degradation of AR via proteasome-pathway. BIRM caused destabilization of HSP90-AR association in LAPC-4 cells. It induced apoptosis in PCa cells by activation of caspase-8 via death receptor and FADD-mediated pathways. A synthetic inhibitor of Caspase-8 cleavage (IETD-CHO) aborted BIRM-induced apoptosis. The effect of BIRM on AKT-mediated survival pathway in both AR+ and AR- negative (PC-3 and DU145) showed decreased levels of p-AKTser 473 in all PCa cell lines. BIRM dosed by oral gavage in mice bearing PC-3ML tumors showed selective efficacy on tumor growth; before tumors are established but limited efficacy when treated on existing tumors. Moreover, BIRM inhibited the LNCaP tumor generated by orthotropic implantation into dorsal prostate of nude mice. Partial purification of BIRM by liquid-liquid extraction and further fractionation by HPLC showed 4-fold increased specific activity on PCa cells.

Recognition of prostate cancer as a genetic disease has prompted a focus on the nuclear genome for biomarker discovery, with little attention given to the mitochondrial genome. While it is evident that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are acquired during prostate tumorigenesis, no study has evaluated the prognostic value of mtDNA variation. Here we used next-generation sequencing to interrogate the mitochondrial genomes from prostate tissue biopsies and matched blood of 115 men having undergone a radical prostatectomy for which there was a mean of 107 months clinical follow-up. We identified 74 unique prostate cancer specific somatic mtDNA variants in 50 patients, providing significant expansion to the growing catalog of prostate cancer mtDNA mutations. While no single variant or variant cluster showed recurrence across multiple patients, we observe a significant positive correlation between the total burden of acquired mtDNA variation and elevated Gleason Score at diagnosis and biochemical relapse.

Methods:   Utility estimate values were calculated using standard gamble (SG) methodology. Study participants valued 18 prostate-specific health states with the five attributes: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, pain, and emotional well-being. Appropriateness of model (linear regression, mixed effects, or generalized estimating equation) to generate prostate cancer utility estimates was determined by paired t-tests to compare observed and predicted values. Mixed-corrected standard SG utility estimates to account for loss aversion were calculated based on prospect theory.  Results:   132 study participants assigned values to the health states (n = 40 men at risk for prostate cancer; n = 43 men with prostate cancer; n = 49 general population). In total, 792 valuations were elicited (six health states for each 132 participants). The most appropriate model for the classification system was a mixed effects model; correlations between the mean observed and predicted utility estimates were greater than 0.80 for each perspective.  Conclusions:   Developing a health-state classification system with preference weights for three different perspectives demonstrates the relative importance of main effects between populations.

Monolayer and spheroid cultures of human prostate stem cells and non-stem cells were incubated with low (1, 10 µM) and high (100, 500 µM) concentrations of LiCl for 72 h. Cell proliferation, apoptotic indices, MK levels and ultrastructure were evaluated. Cells stimulated with low concentrations showed high proliferation, low apoptotic indices, high MK levels and more healthy ultrastructure. Opposite results were obtained at high concentrations. Furthermore, stem cells were more sensitive to stimulation and more resistant to inhibition than non-stem cells. LiCl exhibited concentration-dependent effects on stem cell and non-stem cell groups. MK levels were not involved in the biphasic effect of LiCl; however, they were proportionally affected. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to show the effect of LiCl on PCa stem cells through MK.""","""['Mine Erguven', 'Gulperi Oktem', 'Ali Nail Kara', 'Ayhan Bilir']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Antagonist activity of the antipsychotic drug lithium chloride and the antileukemic drug imatinib mesylate during glioblastoma treatment in vitro.', 'Enhancement of vinorelbine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by clomipramine and lithium chloride in human neuroblastoma cancer cell line SH-SY5Y.', 'Sorafenib and lithium chloride combination treatment shows promising synergistic effects in human glioblastoma multiforme cells in vitro but midkine is not implicated.', 'Midkine downregulation increases the efficacy of quercetin on prostate cancer stem cell survival and migration through PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'The Possible Interactions and Therapeutic Roles of Lithium Chloride and Midkine on Cancer Treatment.', 'Lithium in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Foe?', 'Li-Doped Bioactive Ceramics: Promising Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Feedback Activation of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling via the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in Skin Fibroblasts.']"""

The most typical places of the metastases are pelvic lymphatic glands, bones and lungs, and very rarely it metastasizes into a testis. The prognostic importance of testicular metastasis of prostate cancer is not yet well-known, due to a very few published cases. According to the known facts, it is certain that a metastasis of the prostate carcinoma into a testis is a sign of an advanced disease.  Case report:   This work presents a 48-year-old patient, to whom an adenocarcinoma of the prostate has been proven by the pathohistological finding of transrectal biopsy, performed due to the elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Nine years after the initial diagnosis, due to a gradual rise of PSA and tumorous enlargement of the left testis, left inguinal orchectomy and right orchectomy were performed. Metastatic dissemination of prostate adenocarcinoma into a testis was determined by a pathohistological analysis of the left testis.  Conclusion:   The metastasis of the prostate carcinoma into a testis, as a rare localization of the metastatic dissemination, after additionally performed orchectomy along with further oncological therapy, can provide a continuation of a good life quality as well as a control of the disease in a longer time period.""","""['Zoran Campara', 'Dejan Simic', 'Predrag Aleksic', 'Aleksandar Spasic', 'Snjezana Milicevic']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Arch""","""['Prostate cancer involving bilateral seminal vesicles along with bone and testicular metastases: a case report.', 'Bilateral testicular metastases from prostatic carcinoma.', 'Testicular metastases from prostate carcinoma.', 'Isolated Testicular Metastasis of Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy: Case Report and Literature Review.', 'A case of testicular metastasis from carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis to the testis: an unexpected presentation of a solitary recurrence.']"""

Methods:   Research included 220 patients, who had indication for biopsy (Clinic for Urology, University Clinical Center Sarajevo).  Results:   Average age of patients was 64.6 ± 8.1 years. Kruskal Wallis test indicates that there is a significant difference in age in relation to the diagnosis (KW χ2=12.508; p=0.006). The correlation between the %fPSA level and diagnosis is positive and statistically significant (r=0.211; p=0.002) in the sense that cancer patients have the lowest %fPSA. Analysis of the sensitivity at 95% specificity of %fPSA compared to particular diagnosis shows the highest sensitivity for prostate cancer - 20.61% (8.35-31.02) with statistically significant AUC p<0.05. Analysis of %fPSA test in detecting prostate cancer, at cut-off values ≤ 0.16, shows a sensitivity of 72.3% and specificity of 50.4 (at cut-off values <0.07, sensitivity is 8.4%, and specificity is 97.8%).  Conclusion:   PSA is organ specific but not cancer specific marker, whose total value, as well as the %fPSA serve as a basis, with a digitorectal exam, in the detection of prostate cancer. By increasing the cut-off values sensitivity of %fPSA increases and specificity decreases. %fPSA has a relative importance in the detection of prostate cancer, and should not be used as a guideline, without prior clinical examination.""","""['Alden Prcic', 'Edin Begic', 'Mustafa Hiros']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Arch""","""['Comparisons of the various combinations of free, complexed, and total prostate-specific antigen for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical usefulness of free PSA in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the diagnostic use of free prostate specific antigen/total prostate specific antigen ratio in detecting prostate cancer.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Phosphorylated Proteins from Serum: A Promising Potential Diagnostic Biomarker of Cancer.', 'Clinical application of free/total PSA ratio in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men over 50 years of age with total PSA levels of 2.0-25.0 ng ml-1 in Western China.', 'The auxiliary diagnostic value of prostate-specific antigen and α-methylacyl-CoA racemase in prostate cancer.', 'The Biopsychosocial Burden of Prostate Biopsy at the Time of Its Indication, Procedure, and Pathological Report.', 'Development and Evaluation of an Immunoglobulin Y-Based ELISA for Measuring Prostate Specific Antigen in Human Serum.']"""

Aiming to reduce the incidence of diarrhea, we studied the effects of budesonide on the grade of cabazitaxel-induced diarrhea during the first two treatment cycles.Experimental Design: Between December 2011 and October 2015, 246 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients were randomized to receive standard-of-care cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus prednisone 10 mg/day (group CABA) or same dose/schedule of cabazitaxel with concomitant budesonide 9 mg daily during the first two treatment cycles (group BUD). The occurrence of diarrhea was reported by physicians and by patients in a diary. χ2 tests were used to compare incidence numbers. An intention-to-treat principle was used.Results: In the phase II trial, 227 patients were evaluable. Grade 2-3 diarrhea occurred in 35 patients (15%) and grade 4 diarrhea was not reported. The incidence of grade 2-3 diarrhea was comparable in both treatment groups: 14 of 113 patients in group CABA (12%) versus 21 of 114 patients in group BUD (18%; P = 0.21). Seven patients were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea (n = 5 group CABA vs. n = 2 group BUD).

Also, other toxicities were not affected by budesonide coadministration.Conclusions: The incidence of cabazitaxel-induced diarrhea was notably lower than reported in the TROPIC trial and appears manageable in routine clinical practice.

Tumor cell detection in metastatic patients' BMAs was concordant but 45% more sensitive than using traditional histopathologic interpretation of core bone marrow biopsies. Tumor cell clusters were more prevalent and bigger in BMAs than in blood, expressed higher levels of the androgen receptor protein per tumor cell, and were prognostic in mCRPC. Moreover, the patterns of genomic copy number variation in single tumor cells in paired blood and BMAs showed significant inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity.Conclusions: Paired analysis of single prostate cancer cells in blood and bone shows promise for clinical application and provides complementary information.

The antigens prostein (SLC45A3), TATA-box binding protein (TBP), and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) showed higher reactivity in PCA patients with late disease compared with early disease. Because of its prostate tissue specificity, we focused on prostein and continued with mapping epitopes of the 66-mer protein fragment using patient samples. Using bead-based assays and 15-mer peptides, a minimal peptide epitope was identified and refined by alanine scanning to the KPxAPFP. Further sequence alignment of this motif revealed homology to transmembrane protein 79 (TMEM79) and TGF-beta-induced factor 2 (TGIF2), thus providing a reasoning for cross-reactivity found in females.

Increased expression of AR-V7 is associated with the transition from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to more advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Due to the loss of the ligand-binding domain, AR-V7 is not responsive to traditional AR-targeted therapies, and the mechanisms that regulate AR-V7 are still incompletely understood. Therefore, we aimed to explore existing classes of small molecules that may regulate AR-V7 expression and intracellular localization and their potential therapeutic role in CRPC.  Methods:   We used AR high-content analysis (AR-HCA) to characterize the effects of a focused library of well-characterized clinical compounds on AR-V7 expression at the single-cell level in PC3 prostate cancer cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-AR-V7 (GFP-AR-V7:PC3). In parallel, an orthogonal AR-HCA screen of a small interfering (si)RNA library targeting 635 protein kinases was performed in GFP-AR-V7:PC3. The effect of the Src-Abl inhibitor PD 180970 was further characterized using cell-proliferation assays, quantitative PCR, and western blot analysis in multiple hormone-sensitive and CRPC cell lines.  Results:   Compounds that tended to target Akt, Abl, and Src family kinases (SFKs) decreased overall AR-V7 expression, nuclear translocation, absolute nuclear level, and/or altered nuclear distribution. We identified 20 protein kinases that, when knocked down, either decreased nuclear GFP-AR-V7 levels or altered AR-V7 nuclear distribution, a set that included the SFKs Src and Fyn. The Src-Abl dual kinase inhibitor PD180970 decreased expression of AR-V7 by greater than 46% and decreased ligand-independent transcription of AR target genes in the 22RV1 human prostate carcinoma cell line. Further, PD180970 inhibited androgen-independent cell proliferation in endogenous-AR-V7-expressing prostate cancer cell lines and also overcame bicalutamide resistance observed in the 22RV1 cell line.  Conclusions:   SFKs, especially Src and Fyn, may be important upstream regulators of AR-V7 expression and represent promising targets in a subset of CRPCs expressing high levels of AR-V7.

Methods:   We prospectively evaluated 51 consecutive men for body composition, metabolic factors including glucose- and lipid-related measures, as well as lifestyle factors prior to prostate biopsy. Evaluations were performed in a blinded manner and were subsequently related to biopsy outcomes for: (i) presence or absence of cancer; and (ii) where cancer was present, Gleason score.  Results:   Serum C-peptide concentrations were significantly greater in participants with Gleason scores ≥4 + 3 (2.8 ± 1.1 ng/ml) compared to those with Gleason 3 + 3 (1.4 ± 0.6 ng/ml) or Gleason 3 + 4 (1.3 ± 0.8 ng/ml, P = 0.002), suggesting greater insulin secretion despite lack of differences in fasting glucose concentrations. Central adiposity, measured by waist circumference, was significantly greater in participants with Gleason ≥4 + 3 (110.1 ± 7.4 cm) compared to those with Gleason 3 + 4 (102.0 ± 9.5 cm, P = 0.028). Men with Gleason ≥4 + 3 also had significantly greater leptin concentrations than those with lower Gleason scores (Gleason ≥4 + 3: 15.6 ± 3.3 ng/ml vs. Gleason 3 + 4: 8.1 ± 8.1 ng/ml, P < 0.05) and leptin:adiponectin ratio (Gleason ≥4 + 3: 9.7 ± 6.1 AU, Gleason 3 + 4: 2.9 ± 3.2, Gleason 3 + 3: 2.4 ± 2.1 AU, P = 0.013).  Conclusions:   We profiled a cluster of obesity-related metabolic perturbations (C-peptide, central adiposity, leptin, and leptin:adiponectin ratios) which may associate with more aggressive prostate cancer histology.

Methods:   Data from 38,340 men randomized to the PrCA screening arm in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) were used to develop a PSA growth curve model to estimate PSA rate of change. The model was then used to predict high-risk PrCA in clinical data available from 680,390 veterans seeking routine care. The PSA growth curve was modeled using non-linear mixed regression and the PSA rate was estimated by taking the 1st derivative of the growth curve equation at 1 year prior to diagnosis/exit.  Results:   In the PLCO, PrCA incidence was 8.1%; ≈19% of whom had high-risk PrCA. Overall, a PSA rate threshold of 0.37 ng/ml/year had the best combination of sensitivity (97.2%) and specificity (97.3%) for detecting high-risk PrCA. In the VA data; 7,347 men were diagnosed with PrCA; of these 4,315 (58.7%) were diagnosed with high-risk PrCA. The PLCO optimal threshold of 0.37 ng/ml/year produced sensitivity = 95.5% and specificity = 85.2%. An optimal threshold of 0.99 ng/ml/year in AA produced sensitivity = 89.1% and specificity = 80.0%. PSA rate was a better predictor than the single last PSA value.  Conclusions:   PSA growth curves predicted high-risk PrCA in the PLCO data. Fitting the same algorithm in the VA data produced lower specificity. Although encouraging, this finding underlines the need for further research to prospectively test the algorithm, especially for African-American men, the population group at highest risk of aggressive PrCA.

FOXO3a induces the factors that contribute to cell cycle arrest and is considered a tumor suppressor in several malignant tumors. Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional protein whose high expression is correlated with poor prognoses in various malignant tumors. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between FOXO3a and YB-1 to validate their functional roles in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Western blotting and cytotoxicity assays were conducted in prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells. We also evaluated the protein expressions of FOXO3a and YB-1 in human prostate cancer tissues, using radical prostatectomy specimens. Then, we investigated the correlations between protein expressions and clinicopathologic parameters.  Results:   We found that both FOXO3a and YB-1 proteins were phosphorylated by ERK signaling, resulting in FOXO3a inactivation and YB-1 activation in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Inversely, inhibition of MEK or treatment with metformin activated FOXO3a through inactivation of ERK signaling and suppressed the viability of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In immunohistochemical analysis, FOXO3a nuclear expression was inversely correlated with YB-1 nuclear expression (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, high FOXO3a nuclear expression was inversely correlated with a higher Gleason grade (P < 0.0001) and higher preoperative PSA (P = 0.0437).  Conclusions:   These results showed that in prostate cancer, FOXO3a, and YB-1 play inverse reciprocal roles as a tumor-suppressor gene and oncogene, respectively, through their master regulator ERK.

The prognostic significance of apical PSM remains unclear. We therefore compared the long-term oncologic outcomes of men with apical PSMs to those with negative PSMs, apical and other PSMs, and other PSMs at RP.  Methods:   The SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database was used to identify 4031 men with prostate cancer (PCa) managed with RP with complete pathologic grade and stage data. Margin status was categorized as negative, apex only, or other positive. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for pathologic stage and grade were developed to test the relationship between margin status and biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastases and PCa death.  Results:   In the final cohort, 34.3% had PSMs, whereas 65.7% had negative margins. Univariable analysis showed that compared with negative margins, apex-only PSM was associated with BCR (hazard ratio (HR): 1.4 [1.1-1.8]), but not metastases or PCa death, whereas apex and other PSMs were associated with BCR (HR: 3.3 [2.8-4]) and metastases (HR: 1.8 [1.02-3.1]) but not PCa death. Nonapical PSMs were associated with BCR (HR: 2.7 [2.4-3.1]), metastases (1.7 [1.2-2.5)] and PCa death (1.8 [1.05-3]). On multivariable analysis, apex-only, apex and other, and nonapical PSMs were associated with BCR but margin status was not associated with metastases or PCa death.  Conclusions:   In a large cohort of men undergoing RP, those with PSMs at the prostatic apex had lower BCR, metastases, or PCa death compared with those with PSMs at other locations. When adjusted for pathologic stage and grade, however, PSMs were associated with BCR but not long-term oncologic outcomes.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 4268 radical prostatectomy patients within the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. Cox models accounting for known risk factors were used to examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and PC-specific mortality (PCSM; primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included biochemical recurrence (BCR) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC). BMI was used as a continuous and categorical variable (normal <25 kg/m2, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m2 and obese ⩾30 kg/m2). Median follow-up among all men who were alive at last follow-up was 6.8 years (interquartile range=3.5-11.0). During this time, 1384 men developed BCR, 117 developed CRPC and 84 died from PC. Hazard ratios were analyzed using competing-risks regression analysis accounting for non-PC death as a competing risk.  Results:   On crude analysis, higher BMI was not associated with risk of PCSM (P=0.112), BCR (0.259) and CRPC (P=0.277). However, when BMI was categorized, overweight (hazard ratio (HR) 1.99, P=0.034) and obesity (HR 1.97, P=0.048) were significantly associated with PCSM. Obesity and overweight were not associated with BCR or CRPC (all P⩾0.189). On multivariable analysis adjusting for both clinical and pathological features, results were little changed in that obesity (HR=2.05, P=0.039) and overweight (HR=1.88, P=0.061) were associated with higher risk of PCSM, but not with BCR or CRPC (all P⩾0.114) with the exception that the association for overweight was no longer statistical significant.

Dorsal skin fold chambers were used to image tumor vasculature in vivo Longitudinal gene expression changes in tumors were analyzed using PCR.Results: Reduction of OCT1002 to its active form (OCT1001) decreased prostate cancer cell viability. In LNCaP-luc spheroids, OCT1002 caused increased apoptosis and decreased clonogenicity. In vivo, treatment with OCT1002 alone, or with bicalutamide, showed significantly greater tumor growth control and reduced lung metastases compared with controls. Reestablishment of the tumor microvasculature following bicalutamide-induced vascular collapse is inhibited by OCT1002. Significantly, the upregulation of RUNX2 and its targets caused by bicalutamide alone was blocked by OCT1002.Conclusions: OCT1002 selectively targets hypoxic tumor cells and enhances the antitumor efficacy of bicalutamide. Furthermore, bicalutamide caused changes in gene expression, which indicated progression to a more malignant genotype; OCT1002 blocked these effects, emphasizing that more attention should be attached to understanding genetic changes that may occur during treatment. Early targeting of hypoxic cells with OCT1002 can provide a means of inhibiting prostate tumor growth and malignant progression.

We report a prospective development study investigating focal irreversible electroporation.  Materials and methods:   A total of 20 men with certain characteristics were recruited for study, including a visible index lesion on anterior magnetic resonance imaging that was concordant with transperineal targeted and template prostate mapping biopsy, absent clinically significant disease noted elsewhere (University College London definition 2) and prostate specific antigen 15 ng/ml or less. Our primary objective was to determine the side effect profile at 12 months. Secondary objectives included the domain specific toxicity profile using patient reported outcomes and early disease control using magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy.  Results:   A total of 19 patients with median age of 60 years (IQR 53-66) and median prostate specific antigen 7.75 ng/ml (IQR 5.5-10.03) were treated. Of the patients 16 were available for estimating the first outcome as 1 was lost to followup and 2 had received another form of treatment by study end. All 16 men had pad-free/leak-free continence at 12 months. The proportion of men with erection sufficient for penetration decreased from 12 of 16 (75%) to 11 of 16 (69%). No serious adverse events were recorded. There was a statistically significant improvement in urinary symptoms according to changes in UCLA-EPIC (UCLA Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) (p = 0.039 and 0.001, respectively). Erectile function remained stable according to the change in IIEF-15 (15-Item International Index of Erectile Function) (p = 0.572). Median prostate specific antigen significantly decreased to 1.71 ng/ml (p = 0.001). One man refused followup biopsy. No residual disease was found in 11 patients (61.1%).

In the stratum corneum, serine proteases from the kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family have been implicated in several key homeostatic processes, including desquamation. However, the precise contribution of specific KLKs to each process remains unclear. To address this, we used a chemical biology approach and designed selective substrates and inhibitors for KLK7, the most abundant KLK protease in the stratum corneum. The resulting KLK7 inhibitor is the most potent inhibitor of this protease reported to date (Ki = 140 pM), and displays at least 1,000-fold selectivity over several proteases that are related by function (KLK5 and KLK14) or specificity (chymotrypsin). We then used substrates and inhibitors for KLK5, KLK7, and KLK14 to explore the activity of each protease in the stratum corneum using casein zymography and an ex vivo desquamation assay. These experiments provide the most detailed assessment of each KLK's contribution to corneocyte shedding in the plantar stratum corneum, revealing that inhibition of KLK7 alone is sufficient to block shedding, whereas KLK5 is also a major contributor.

In this report, we summarize the results of combining histotripsy at low frequency (345 and 500 kHz) with PFP-NDs and PFH-NDs on the ablation of PC-3 and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Using custom built histotripsy transducers coupled to a microscope and a high speed recording camera, we imaged the generation of a cavitation bubble cloud in response to different ultrasound regimes in solution and in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms. We quantified the associated ablation of individual cancer cells and 3D spheroids suspended in solution and embedded in tissue phantoms to compare the ablative capacity of PFP-NDs and PFH-NDs. Results show that histotripsy pulses at high acoustic pressure (26.2 MPa) ablated 80% of prostate cancer spheroids embedded in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms. In comparison, combining histotripsy pulses at a dramatically lower acoustic pressure (12.8 MPa) with PFP-NDs and PFH-NDs caused an ablation of 40% and 80% of the tumor spheroid volumes, respectively.

In this study, we evaluated the length of needle cores sampled during transrectal PBx (TRUSBx) and its impact on cancer diagnosis in a standard 14-core scheme.  Methods:   Medical records of 573 patients who underwent an initial TRUSBx with 14-cores scheme for suspicious prostate cancer (PCa) at our Department were reviewed. The PBx procedure and pathological evaluation were standardized. Cores lengths were compared in patients with versus without cancer, and were divided into group A and B, respectively. Statistical analysis was done to define an acceptable cut-off for biopsy length.  Results:   The mean age of the entire cohort was 62.1 ± 7.2 years, while median total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate volume were 4.2 ng/ml and 44.7 ml, respectively. PCa was showed in 33.3% of patients. Mean core length in group A versus B was 11.9 ± 3.9 versus 11.1 ± 3.2 mm (p = 0.016). Thus, core lengths were significantly longer in patients with cancer. There were no statistically significant differences when we considered the whole length of cores sampled from the right lobe (p = 0.58) and left lobe (p = 0.34).  Conclusions:   The cancer detection rates in cores may be increased by core length in PCa patients during a TRUSBx.

Methods:   The study excluded patients under androgen deprivation, with lymph node involvement (cN1 status), and having undergone unilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy (RP). Lymph node micrometastases were classified as unilateral (pN1m) and bilateral (pN1b). Analysis considered multivariate multinomial logistic regression models.  Results:   Between January 2013 and March 2015, 140 patients underwent PLND during RP. Lymph node micrometastases were detected in 28 cases (20%) including pN1m in 19 (13.6%) and pN1b in 9 (6.4%). Independent clinical predictors of pN1b included prostate-specific antigen (PSA, µg/L) >12.5 (odds ratio [OR] = 43.0), proportion of positive biopsy cores (PBC) >0.57 (OR = 6.7), and biopsy Gleason grade (bGG) >3 (OR = 7.5).

Conclusions:   In cN0 patients with localized PCa undergoing PLND, a nonnegligible rate of multiple lymph node micrometastases was detected (32.2%). In the natural history of PCa, there is a close association between pT3b and pN1b disease.

Familial UM (FUM), defined as two or more family members diagnosed with UM, is rare and estimated at less than 1% of all UM. Currently, BAP1 is the only gene known to contribute significant risk for UM. In this study we aimed to estimate the frequency of BAP1 mutation in FUM and to characterize the family and personal histories of other cancers in these families. We identified 32 families with FUM, including seven families previously reported by our group. BAP1 mutation testing was carried out by direct sequencing of the coding exons and the adjacent untranslated regions of the gene. Germline deletion and duplication analysis of BAP1 was assessed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Germline BAP1 mutations were found in 6/32 (19%) families. No deletions or duplications were identified in any of the 24 samples tested by MLPA. Combined with published studies, the frequency of BAP1 mutations was 14/64 (22%) in FUM. FUM families without BAP1 mutations have distinct family histories with high rates of prostate cancer in first- and second-degree relatives. It is likely that additional genes conferring risk for FUM exist. It is important to understand key shared features of FUM to focus future research on identifying these additional tumor predisposition syndromes.

Whereas the majority of solid tumors now have a range of molecular and/or immunological markers to help define prognosis and treatment options, prostate cancer still relies mainly on histological grading and clinical parameters. We have recently reported that androgen receptor (AR) expression in stroma inversely associates with prostate cancer-specific survival, and that stromal AR reduces metastasis. For this paper, we tested the hypothesis that the AR-regulated gene FKBP51 could be used as a marker of AR activity to better predict outcome.  Methods:   Using immunohistochemistry on a cohort of 64 patient-matched benign and malignant prostate tissues, we assessed patient outcome by FKBP51 and AR levels. Immunoblot and RT-qPCR were used to demonstrate androgen regulation of FKBP51 in primary and primary human prostatic fibroblasts and fibroblast cell-lines.  Results:   As predicted by FKBP51 level, high AR activity in cancer stroma was associated with longer median survival (1,306 days) compared with high AR alone (699 days), whereas those with low AR and/or low FKBP51 did poorly (384 and 338 days, respectively). Survival could not be predicted on the basis cancer epithelial AR levels or activity, and was not associated with immunoreactivity in patient matched benign tissues.  Conclusion:   FKBP51 improves the ability of stromal AR to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality. By adding additional immunological assessment, similar to what is already in place in a number of other cancers, we could better serve patients with prostate cancer in prognosis and informed treatment choices.

To evaluate the relationship between UPR signaling pathway and the prognosis of PCa, we explored the expression of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 in tissues.  Methods:   A total of 160 PCa and 30 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues were collected. The expression of UPR signaling factors was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The staining characteristics were identified and evaluated for associations with clinicopathologic parameters, PSA recurrence survival, and prostate cancer-specific morality.  Results:   The expressions of ATF6α, PERK, and IRE1α were significantly associated with Gleason grade, PSA level, T stages and M stage, while this association was not significant in N stage. Additionally, UPR signaling factors expressed correlatively with each other. In further studies, high expression level of UPR signaling factors was usually detected in patients who suffered poor prognosis. Patients with positive UPR signaling factors meet shorter survival duration both on cancer-specific morality and PSA recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that IRE1α (HR = 4.461 95%CI = 1.270-15.670 P = 0.020) could be a potential factor in predicting PSA recurrence independently.  Conclusions:   UPR signaling factors were co-activated and activation of UPR signaling was implicated to the malignant progression and worse prognosis of PCa. The mechanism and function of UPR signaling in PCa are still to be determined.

Clinical application of nanoparticles seems promising. We aim to evaluate the possible antitumor activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) as a chemotherapeutic approach in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. An in vitro study was performed on three different cell lines, namely human hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2), human prostate cancer (PC3), and none-small cell lung cancer (A549) cell lines. An in vivo study using diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced HCC in adult male Wistar rats was conducted to investigate the potential antitumor activity of ZnONPs in HCC and the possible underlying mechanisms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was induced by oral administration of DENA given in drinking water (100 mg/L) for 8 weeks. Rats were allocated into four groups, namely a control group, an HCC control group receiving DENA alone, a ZnONPs (10 μg/kg per week, intravenous (i.v.) for 1 month) control group, and a ZnONPs treatment group (receiving ZnONPs + DENA). ZnONPs significantly reduced the elevated serum levels of HCC-related tumor markers alphafetoprotein and alpha-l-fucosidase and the apoptotic marker caspase-3 compared with the untreated HCC rats. In addition, treatment with ZnONPs significantly decreased the elevated levels of hepatocyte integrity and oxidative stress markers as compared with the untreated HCC control group. Furthermore, the histopathological study revealed anaplasia and fibrous degenerations which were significantly corrected by ZnONPs treatment. In conclusion, administration of ZnONPs exhibited a promising preclinical anticancer efficacy in HCC and could be considered as a novel strategy for the treatment HCC in clinical practices.""","""['Hesham Fathy Hassan Hassan', 'Ahmed Mohamed Mansour', 'Amira Morad Hussein Abo-Youssef', 'Bakheet E M Elsadek', 'Basim Anwar Shehata Messiha']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol""","""['Anticancer potential of ZnO nanoparticle-ferulic acid conjugate on Huh-7 and HepG2 cells and diethyl nitrosamine induced hepatocellular cancer on Wistar albino rat.', 'Green synthesized-zinc oxide nanoparticles, the strong apoptosis inducer as an exclusive antitumor agent in murine breast tumor model and human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7).', 'Doxorubicin-Conjugated Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles, Biogenically Synthesised Using a Fungus Aspergillus niger, Exhibit High Therapeutic Efficacy against Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Zinc oxide nanoparticles: A comprehensive review on its synthesis, anticancer and drug delivery applications as well as health risks.', 'Zinc Oxide Nanoparticle as a Novel Class of Antifungal Agents: Current Advances and Future Perspectives.', 'Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Trigger Autophagy in the Human Multiple Myeloma Cell Line RPMI8226: an In Vitro Study.', 'Green Synthesized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Using Moringa olifera Ethanolic Extract Lessens Acrylamide-Induced Testicular Damage, Apoptosis, and Steroidogenesis-Related Gene Dysregulation in Adult Rats.', 'Metal Oxide Nanoparticles: Review of Synthesis, Characterization and Biological Effects.', 'Environmental Implications Associated with the Development of Nanotechnology: From Synthesis to Disposal.', 'Role of inorganic nanoparticle degradation in cancer therapy.']"""

Lymphocyte function after stimulation with mitogens and microbial antigens was assessed prior to therapy and at day 1, 7 and 28 after therapy.  Results:   Lymphocyte proliferation and the production of interferon-γ and interleukin-10 towards mitogens and antigens remained unchanged after therapy. Consistent with these in vitro data, we did not observe infectious complications after treatment.  Conclusions:   The results argue against an impairment of lymphocyte function after 223Ra therapy.

Three types of errors were introduced into the original plans: gantry angle independent and dependent MLC errors, and gantry angle dependent dose errors. The dose matrix measured by each detector system for the no-error and error introduced delivery were compared with the reference Treatment Planning System (TPS) calculated dose matrix for no-error plans using gamma (γ) analysis with 2%/2mm tolerance criteria. The ability of the detector system in identifying the minimum error in each scenario was assessed by analysing the gamma pass rates of no error delivery and error delivery using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The relative sensitivity of the system was assessed by determining the slope of the gamma pass line for studied error magnitude in each error scenario.  Results:   In the gantry angle independent and dependent MLC error scenario the Delta4, Multicube and Octavius4D systems detected a minimum 2mm error. In the gantry angle dependent dose error scenario all studied systems detected a minimum 3% and 2% error in prostate and H&N plans respectively.

However, HM450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical evaluation of the new EPIC array platform.  Results:   EPIC covers over 850,000 CpG sites, including >90 % of the CpGs from the HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 % of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 % distal and 27 % proximal ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation.

The concept of precision medicine aims to exploit this cancer heterogeneity by incorporating diagnostic technology to characterize each cancer patient's molecular subtype for tailored treatments. To characterize cancer molecular subtypes accurately, a suite of multiplexed bioassays have currently been developed to detect multiple oncogenic biomarkers. Despite the reliability of current multiplexed detection techniques, novel strategies are still needed to resolve limitations such as long assay time, complex protocols, and difficulty in interpreting broad overlapping spectral peaks of conventional fluorescence readouts. Herein a rapid (80 min) multiplexed platform strategy for subtyping prostate cancer tumor and urine samples based on their RNA biomarker profiles is presented. This is achieved by combining rapid multiplexed isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) of target RNA biomarkers with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) nanotags for ""one-pot"" readout. This is the first translational application of a RT-RPA/SERS-based platform for multiplexed cancer biomarker detection to address a clinical need. With excellent sensitivity of 200 zmol (100 copies) and specificity, we believed that this platform methodology could be a useful tool for rapid multiplexed subtyping of cancers.""","""['Kevin M Koo', 'Eugene J H Wee', 'Paul N Mainwaring', 'Yuling Wang', 'Matt Trau']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Small""","""['A nanoplasmonic label-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering strategy for non-invasive cancer genetic subtyping in patient samples.', 'Integrated SERS-Vertical Flow Biosensor Enabling Multiplexed Quantitative Profiling of Serological Exosomal Proteins in Patients for Accurate Breast Cancer Subtyping.', 'Molecular biomarkers to guide precision medicine in localized prostate cancer.', 'Sensitive multiplex detection of serological liver cancer biomarkers using SERS-active photonic crystal fiber probe.', 'Merging new-age biomarkers and nanodiagnostics for precision prostate cancer management.', 'Detection of rare prostate cancer cells in human urine offers prospect of non-invasive diagnosis.', 'Molecular Subtypes of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Immunosuppression Genes Using a Deep Learning Approach.', 'Recent Developments on Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles as Smart Photo-Therapeutic Agents for Cancer Treatments-A Review.', 'Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Cancer Immunotherapy Applications: Opportunities, Challenges, and Current Progress in Nanomaterial Strategies.', 'Plasmonic nanobiosensors for detection of microRNA cancer biomarkers in clinical samples.']"""

We assessed whether a model incorporating both the preoperative risk group and APFs could predict long-term oncologic outcomes better than a model based on APFs alone.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 4,404 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution between 1992 and 2014. After excluding patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy or with incomplete pathological or follow-up data, 3,092 men were included in the final analysis. APFs were defined as extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), or a positive surgical margin (PSM). The adequacy of model fit to the data was compared using the likelihood-ratio test between the models with and without risk groups, and model discrimination was compared with the concordance index (c-index) for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk regression analyses to identify predictors of BCR and PCSM in the total patient group and each of the risk groups.  Results:   Adding risk groups to the model containing only APFs significantly improved the fit to the data (likelihood-ratio test, p <0.001) and the c-index increased from 0.693 to 0.732 for BCR and from 0.707 to 0.747 for PCSM. A RP Gleason score (GS) ≥8 and a PSM were independently associated with BCR in the total patient group and also each risk group. However, only a GS ≥8 and SVI were associated with PCSM in the total patient group (GS ≥8: hazard ratio [HR] 5.39 and SVI: HR 3.36) and the high-risk group (GS ≥8: HR 6.31 and SVI: HR 4.05).  Conclusion:   The postoperative estimation of oncologic outcomes in men with APFs at RP was improved by considering preoperative risk group stratification.

Today most patients may expect to live years following the diagnosis and may thus experience significant morbidity due to disease progression and treatment toxicity. In order to address some of these problems exercise has been suggested and previously studies have shown improvements of disease specific quality of life and a reduction in treatment-related toxicity. Cohort studies with long term follow up have suggested that physical activity is associated with improved survival in prostate cancer patients. Previously one randomised controlled trial has examined the efficacy of football in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy to usual care and reported positive effects on lean body mass and bone markers. Against this background, we wish to examine the effectiveness of community-based football for men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a randomised controlled parallel group, multicenter, superiority trial design, two hundred prostate cancer patients will be recruited and randomised (1:1) to either community-based football one hour twice weekly or to a control group. The intervention period will be six months. The primary outcome is quality of life assessed after 12 weeks based on the change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are change from baseline to six months in quality of life, lean body mass, fat mass, whole body and regional bone markers, as well as physical activity and functional capacity at 12 weeks and six months. Safety outcome variables will be falls resulting in seeking medical assessment and fractures during the six-month period.  Discussion:   Football is viewed as a case for non-professional, supervised community-based team sport for promoting long-term physical activity in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. This randomised trial will provide data on effectiveness and safety for men with prostate cancer when football training is delivered in local football clubs.

Our former research results show that IL-17A and IL-17 F contribute to the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (Pca) while IL-17E interacting with IL-17RB might have an anti-tumor effect.  Results:   Using imunohistochemistry, we systemically compared immunoreactivity of ligands (IL-17A, E and F) and receptors (IL-17RA, IL-17RB and IL-17RC) of IL-17 family, infiltration of inflammatory cells and changes of structural cells (fibroblast cells, smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells) in sections of bladder tissues from subjects with bladder cancer, cystitis and bladder polyp. Compared with subjects with cystitis, immunoreactivity for IL-17A, IL-17 F and IL-17RC was significantly elevated in the group of bladder cancer (p < 0.01), while immunoreactivity of IL-17E, IL-17RA and IL-17RB, and the infiltrating neutrophils were decreased (p < 0.05). The numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes and phagocytes and CD31+ blood vessels and immunoreactivity of CD90+ fibroblasts were also elevated in patients with bladder cancer compared with those of cystitis. The patterns of IL-17 ligands and receptors, and inflammatory cells and structural cells varied in cystitis, bladder polyp and bladder cancer. In bladder cancer, immunoreactivity of IL-17E and IL-17 F was positively correlated with smooth muscles and lymphocytes, respectively. In addition, immunoreactivity of IL-17A and IL-17E was positively correlated with their receptors IL-17RA and IL-17RB respectively.

To study mechanisms by which BM-MSCs and prostate cancer cells may interact, we assessed the migration, invasion, adhesion and proliferation of bone-derived prostate cancer cells (PC-3) in co-culture with pluripotent human BM-MSCs. We observed a strong adhesive, migratory and invasive phenotype of PC-3 cells with BM- MSC-co-culture and set out to isolate and characterize the bioactive principle. Initial studies indicated that chemotaxis was secondary to a protein residing in the >100kDa fraction. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) recovered peak activity in a high-molecular weight fraction containing thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). While TSP1 immunodepletion decreased activity, put-back with purified TSP1 did not reproduce bioactivity. Further purification of the TSP1-containing high-molecular weight fraction of the BM-MSC secretome with heparin-affinity chromatography recovered bioactivity with highly restricted bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, determined by mass spectroscopy to be proteolytic fragments of fibronectin (FN). Put-back experiments with full-length FN permitted adhesion but failed to induce migration. Monospecific antibodies to FN blocked adhesion. Proteolytic cleavage of FN generated FN fragments which now induced migration. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to FN receptors α5 and β1 integrins, and α5 knockdown specifically blocked migration and adhesion.  Conclusion:   Fibronectin fragments (FNFr) function as matrikines driving the chemotactic affinity of prostate cancer cells via the α5β1 integrin.

PET imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC has recently found widespread application in the diagnosis of recurrent PCa. In this study, the diagnostic potential of 64Cu-labeled PSMA ligand (PSMA-617) PET in patients with PCa has been investigated.  Materials and methods:   The study was conducted simultaneously at two nuclear medicine centers, Austria (Vienna, Center 1) and Germany (Bad Berka, Center 2). The patients (n = 29) included in this study were referred for PET (Center 1, 21 patients) or PET/CT (Center 2, 8 patients) imaging with either a high suspicion of recurrent disease or for possible surgical or PSMA radioligand therapy planning. PET images of the whole body were performed at 1 hour p.i. and additional images of the pelvis at 2 hours p.i.  Results:   In 23 of 29 patients, at least one focus of pathological tracer uptake suspicious for primary disease in the prostate lobe or recurrent disease was detected. Among healthy organs, the salivary glands, kidneys, and liver showed the highest radiotracer uptake. Lesions suspicious for PCa were detected with excellent contrast as early as 1 hour p.i. with high detection rates even at low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Conclusion:   The preliminary results of this study demonstrate the high potential of 64Cu-PSMA ligand PET/CT imaging in patients with recurrent disease and in the primary staging of selected patients with progressive local disease. The acquired PET images showed an excellent resolution of the detected lesions with very high lesion-to- background contrast.

For this reason, artificial self-assembling RNA nanostructures are emerging as a powerful tool with broad applications in drug delivery and metabolic pathway regulation. To date, coordinated delivery of functional molecules via programmable RNA assemblies has been primarily done using nanosize RNA scaffolds. However, larger scaffolds could expand existing capabilities for spatial arrangement of ligands, and enable the controlled delivery of highly concentrated molecular loads. Here, we investigate whether micron-size RNA scaffolds can be assembled and further functionalized with different cargos (e.g. various siRNAs and fluorescent tags) for their synchronized delivery to diseased cells. Since known design approaches to build large RNA scaffolds are still underdeveloped, we apply a tiling method widely used in DNA nanotechnology. DNA tiles have been extensively used to build a variety of scalable and modular structures that are easily decorated with other ligands. Here, we adapt a double crossover (DX) DNA tile motif to design de novo DX RNA tiles that assemble and form lattices via programmed sticky end interactions. We optimize assembly protocols to guarantee high yield of RNA lattices. The resulting constructs are robust and modular with respect to the presence of distinct siRNAs and fluorophores. RNA tiles and lattices are successfully transfected in either human breast cancer or prostate cancer cells, where they efficiently knockdown the expression of target genes. Blood serum stability assays indicate that RNA lattices are more resilient to nuclease degradation when compared to individual tiles, thus making them better suited for therapeutic purposes. Overall, because of its design simplicity, we anticipate that this approach will be utilized for a wide range of applications in therapeutic RNA nanotechnology.""","""['Jaimie Marie Stewart', 'Mathias Viard', 'Hari K K Subramanian', 'Brandon K Roark', 'Kirill A Afonin', 'Elisa Franco']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Correction: Programmable RNA microstructures for coordinated delivery of siRNAs.', 'Self-assembly of multi-stranded RNA motifs into lattices and tubular structures.', 'Building DNA nanostructures for molecular computation, templated assembly, and biological applications.', 'Programmable DNA tile self-assembly using a hierarchical sub-tile strategy.', 'DNA nanoarchitectures: steps towards biological applications.', 'Programmable and Multifunctional DNA-Based Materials for Biomedical Applications.', 'Nuclease resistance of DNA nanostructures.', 'Therapeutic immunomodulation by rationally designed nucleic acids and nucleic acid nanoparticles.', 'Multimeric RNAs for efficient RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines.', 'Assembly of RNA Nanostructures from Double-Crossover Tiles.', 'Rational design for controlled release of Dicer-substrate siRNA harbored in phi29 pRNA-based nanoparticles.']"""

Capturing these rare cells, however, represents a major engineering challenge due to their low abundance, morphology and heterogeneity. A variety of microfluidic tools have been developed to isolate CTCs from drawn blood samples; however, few of these approaches offer a means to separate and analyze cells in an integrated system. We have developed a microfluidic platform comprised of three modules that offers high throughput separation of cancer cells from blood and on-chip organization of those cells for streamlined analyses. The first module uses an acoustic standing wave to rapidly align cells in a contact-free manner. The second module then separates magnetically labeled cells from unlabeled cells, offering purities exceeding 85% for cells and 90% for binary mixtures of synthetic particles. Finally, the third module contains a spatially periodic array of microwells with underlying micromagnets to capture individual cells for on-chip analyses (e.g., staining, imaging and quantification).

In this study, we evaluated the combination of two Hh inhibitors, the SMO inhibitor GDC-0449 and the GLI inhibitor GANT61 with radiotherapy in different prostate cancer (PCa) models. In vitro, GANT61 was able to sensitize 22Rv1 PCa cells but not PC3 and DU145 PCa cells. The lack of radiosensitization in the latter cell lines was shown to be dependent on the presence of mutated p53. Introduction of WT p53 into PC3 cells resulted in radiosensization following GANT61 treatment, suggesting that the p53 transcription factor plays an important role in the GANT61-induced radiosensitization in vitro. Targeting at the level of SMO (GDC-0449) did not show cytotoxicity or synergy with radiation. Furthermore, we confirmed the radiosensitization effect of GANT61 in two in vivo xenograft PCa models. The decrease in tumor growth was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.

PSMA activity was dependent on the assembly of a macromolecular complex including filamin A, beta1 integrin, p130CAS, c-Src and EGFR. Within this complex beta1 integrin became activated thereby inducing a c-Src-dependent EGFR phosphorylation at Y1086 and Y1173 EGF-independent residues. Silencing or blocking experiments with drugs demonstrated that all the complex components were required for full PSMA-dependent promotion of cell growth and/or survival in 3D culture, but that p130CAS and EGFR exerted a major role. All PSMA complex components were found assembled in multiple samples of two high-grade prostate carcinomas and associated with EGFR phosphorylation at Y1086. The expression of p130CAS and pEGFRY1086 was thus analysed by tissue micro array in 16 castration-resistant prostate carcinomas selected from 309 carcinomas and stratified from GS 3+4 to GS 5+5.

The ACS developed a unique decision aid (ACS-DA) for this purpose. However, to date, studies evaluating the efficacy of the ACS-DA are lacking. The authors evaluated the ACS-DA among a cohort of medically underserved men (MUM).  Methods:   A multiethnic cohort of MUM (n = 285) was prospectively included between June 2010 and December 2014. The ACS-DA was presented in a group format. Levels of knowledge on PCa were evaluated before and after the presentation. Participants' decisional conflict and thoughts about the presentation also were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with having an adequate level of knowledge.  Results:   Before receiving the ACS-DA, 33.1% of participants had adequate knowledge on PCa, and this increased to 77% after the DA (P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, higher education level (odds ratio, 11.19; P = .001) and history of another cancer (odds ratio, 7.45; P = .03) were associated with having adequate knowledge after receiving the DA. Levels of decisional conflict were low and were correlated with levels of knowledge after receiving the DA. The majority of men also rated the presentation as favorable and would recommend the ACS-DA to others.  Conclusions:   Use of the ACS-DA was feasible among MUM and led to increased PCa knowledge. This also correlated with low levels of decisional conflict. The ACS-DA presented to groups of men may serve as a feasible tool for informed decision making in a MUM population.

This was converted to rates using ONS population projections. Modified data sets were generated for breast and prostate cancers.  Results:   Cancer incidence rates are projected to decrease by 0.03% in males and increase by 0.11% in females yearly between 2015 and 2035; thyroid, liver, oral and kidney cancer are among the fastest accelerating cancers. 243 690 female and 270 261 male cancer cases are projected for 2035. Breast and prostate cancers are projected to be the most common cancers among females and males, respectively in 2035. Most cancers' mortality rate is decreasing; there are notable increases for liver, oral and anal cancer. For 2035, there are 95 961 female deaths projected and 116 585 male deaths projected.

Accordingly, the analysis of telomeres in tissue sections of patient tumor samples can be exploited to obtain diagnostic information and to define tumor subgroups. In many instances, however, analysis of the image data is conducted by manual inspection of 2D images at relatively low resolution for only a small part of the sample. As the telomere feature signal distribution is frequently heterogeneous, this approach is prone to a biased selection of the information present in the image and lacks subcellular details. Here we address these issues by using an automated high-resolution imaging and analysis workflow that quantifies individual telomere features on tissue sections for a large number of cells. The approach is particularly suited to assess telomere heterogeneity and low abundant cellular subpopulations with distinct telomere characteristics in a reproducible manner. It comprises the integration of multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and DNA staining with targeted automated 3D fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. We apply our method to telomeres in glioblastoma and prostate cancer samples, and describe how the imaging data can be used to derive statistically reliable information on telomere length distribution or colocalization with PML nuclear bodies. We anticipate that relating this approach to clinical outcome data will prove to be valuable for pretherapeutic patient stratification.""","""['Manuel Gunkel', 'Inn Chung', 'Stefan Wörz', 'Katharina I Deeg', 'Ronald Simon', 'Guido Sauter', 'David T W Jones', 'Andrey Korshunov', 'Karl Rohr', 'Holger Erfle', 'Karsten Rippe']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Methods""","""['Novel automated three-dimensional genome scanning based on the nuclear architecture of telomeres.', 'Cell Type-Specific Quantification of Telomere Length and DNA Double-strand Breaks in Individual Lung Cells by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and Fluorescent Immunohistochemistry.', 'A three-dimensional colocalization RNA interference screening platform to elucidate the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway.', 'Nuclear imaging in three dimensions: a unique tool in cancer research.', 'Multispectral confocal 3D imaging of intact healthy and tumor tissue using mLSR-3D.', 'The prostate tissue-based telomere biomarker as a prognostic tool for metastasis and death from prostate cancer after prostatectomy.', 'PITX1 Is a Regulator of TERT Expression in Prostate Cancer with Prognostic Power.', 'ALT-FISH quantifies alternative lengthening of telomeres activity by imaging of single-stranded repeats.', 'Transcriptional Activation of Heterochromatin by Recruitment of dCas9 Activators.', 'A C-circle assay for detection of alternative lengthening of telomere activity in FFPE tissue.']"""

Its adoption has been driven by market forces and patient preference, and debate continues regarding whether it offers improved outcomes to justify the higher cost relative to open surgery. We examined the comparative effectiveness of robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy in cancer control and survival in a nationally representative population.  Materials and methods:   This population based observational cohort study of patients with prostate cancer undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and open radical prostatectomy during 2003 to 2012 used data captured in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-Medicare linked database. Propensity score matching and time to event analysis were used to compare all cause mortality, prostate cancer specific mortality and use of additional treatment after surgery.  Results:   A total of 6,430 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies and 9,161 open radical prostatectomies performed during 2003 to 2012 were identified. The use of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy increased from 13.6% in 2003 to 2004 to 72.6% in 2011 to 2012. After a median followup of 6.5 years (IQR 5.2-7.9) robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was associated with an equivalent risk of all cause mortality (HR 0.85, 0.72-1.01) and similar cancer specific mortality (HR 0.85, 0.50-1.43) vs open radical prostatectomy. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was also associated with less use of additional treatment (HR 0.78, 0.70-0.86).  Conclusions:   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy has comparable intermediate cancer control as evidenced by less use of additional postoperative cancer therapies and equivalent cancer specific and overall survival. Longer term followup is needed to assess for differences in prostate cancer specific survival, which was similar during intermediate followup. Our findings have significant quality and cost implications, and provide reassurance regarding the adoption of more expensive technology in the absence of randomized controlled trials.""","""['Jim C Hu', ""Padraic O'Malley"", 'Bilal Chughtai', 'Abby Isaacs', 'Jialin Mao', 'Jason D Wright', 'Dawn Hershman', 'Art Sedrakyan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Comparative effectiveness of robot-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy cancer control.', 'Retzius Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Conveys Early Regain of Continence over Conventional Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis of 1,863 Patients.', 'Comparative Analysis of Partial Gland Ablation and Radical Prostatectomy to Treat Low and Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer: Oncologic and Functional Outcomes.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer.', 'Patients Regret Their Choice of Therapy Significantly Less Frequently after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy as Opposed to Open Radical Prostatectomy: Patient-Reported Results of the Multicenter Cross-Sectional IMPROVE Study.', 'Prospective Multicenter Comparison of Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: The PROST-QA/RP2 Consortium.', 'Examination of Necessity for Pelvic Drain Placement After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of 1-Year Health Care Costs and Use Associated With Open vs Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of robotic-assisted versus retropubic radical prostatectomy: a single cancer center experience.']"""

Clinical studies suggested that beta-blocker (BB) might impact the prognosis of breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian, lung, and skin cancer. This retrospective study evaluated the effect of BB in MM disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). Among 1,971 newly diagnosed MM patients seen at Mayo Clinic between 1995 and 2010, usage of BB and other cardiac (or antihypertensive) medications were abstracted. Cumulative incidence function and Kaplan-Meier method were used to estimate 5-year cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of MM death and OS rate, respectively. Nine hundred and thirty (47.2%) patients had no intake of cardiac medications; 260 (13.2%) used BB alone; 343 (17.4%) used both BB/non-BB cardiac medications; and 438 (22.2%) had non-BB cardiac drugs. Superior MM DSS was observed in BB only users, compared to patients without any cardiac drugs ( HRadj.CS, 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.67, Padj. <0.0001) and non-BB cardiac drugs users ( HRadj.CS, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.38-0.63, Padj. <0.0001).

Understanding the pathways that lead to prostate cancer progression is an important task to prevent this deadly disease. The ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF has an important role in differentiation of human prostate epithelial cells. Loss of ESE3/EHF in prostate epithelial cells determines transformation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of stem-like properties. In this study we identify IL-6 as a direct target of ESE3/EHF that is activated in prostate epithelial cells upon loss of ESE3/EHF. ESE3/EHF and IL-6 were significantly inversely correlated in prostate tumors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of ESE3/EHF to a novel ETS binding site in the IL-6 gene promoter. Inhibition of IL-6 reverted transformation and stem-like phenotype in tumorigenic ESE3/EHF knockdown prostate epithelial cell models. Conversely, IL-6 stimulation induced malignant phenotypes, stem-like behavior and STAT3 activation. Increased level of IL-6 was observed in prostatospheres compared with adherent bulk cancer cells and this was associated with stronger activation of STAT3. Human prostate tumors with IL-6 elevation and loss of ESE3/EHF were associated with STAT3 activation and displayed upregulation of genes related to cell adhesion, cancer stem-like and metastatic spread. Pharmacological inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 activation by a JAK inhibitor restrained cancer stem cell growth in vitro and inhibited self-renewal in vivo.

SREs included radiation (RAD), pathological fractures (PF), bone surgery (BS), and spinal cord compression (SCC). The association between site of metastasis at diagnosis and SRE was examined using a Cox proportional hazards model that accounts for death as a competing risk. Among 4404 men (median age: 79 years) with incident metastatic prostate cancer, 44% experienced SREs at a median of 9.6 months post diagnosis.

Here, we found that As4 S4 could repress the overexpression of microRNA-372 (miR-372) in two prostate cancer cell lines and its overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration. Large tumour suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) was confirmed as a direct target of miR-372 using luciferase assays in these two prostate cancer cell lines. Down-regulation of LATS2 could promote prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration just as overexpression of miR-372 did and overexpression of LATS2 could reverse this effect of miR-372. The antitumour activity of As4 S4 and the oncogenic function of miR-372 were further confirmed using a mouse xenograft model. Altogether, our data showed evidence that repressing the overexpression of miR-372 by As4 S4 could inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration by targeting LATS2.

The expression levels of EMT-related markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, were detected in relation to Ovol2 expression. The prognostic significance of Ovol2 in patients with HCC was statistically analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Ovol2 expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Low expression of Ovol2 was detected in HCC tissues with poor histological differentiation, microvascular invasion, and cirrhosis. A significant relationship was observed between Ovol2 and EMT marker expression levels.

Like other types of NHL, ALCL primarily involves the nodal area, and sometimes it can involve several extra-nodal sites such as skin, soft tissue, and lungs. However, extensive bone involvement in cases of ALCL is very rare whether it is primary or secondary. Without nodular involvement, ALCL can be misdiagnosed as bone tumor or metastatic carcinoma such as lung, breast, or prostate cancer, which frequently spread to bone. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old woman with generalized pain and 2 months of fever of unknown origin presented to our institution. After extensive evaluation, only multiple osteolytic bone lesions with periosteal soft tissue reaction were identified. Repeated core needle biopsy revealed only inflammatory cells with histiocytic reactions. After pathologic and chromosomal analysis of sufficient tissue, which was acquired from incisional biopsy, primary bone ALCL was confirmed.

Our objective was to compare empirically different cluster detection methods. We assessed their ability to find spatial clusters of cancer cases and evaluated the impact of the socioeconomic status (e.g., the Townsend index) on cancer incidence.  Methods:   Moran's I, the empirical Bayes index (EBI), and Potthoff-Whittinghill test were used to investigate the general clustering. The local cluster detection methods were: i) the spatial oblique decision tree (SpODT); ii) the spatial scan statistic of Kulldorff (SaTScan); and, iii) the hierarchical Bayesian spatial modeling (HBSM) in a univariate and multivariate setting. These methods were used with and without introducing the Townsend index of socioeconomic deprivation known to be related to the distribution of cancer incidence. Incidence data stemmed from the Cancer Registry of Isère and were limited to prostate, lung, colon-rectum, and bladder cancers diagnosed between 1999 and 2007 in men only.  Results:   The study found a spatial heterogeneity (p < 0.01) and an autocorrelation for prostate (EBI = 0.02; p = 0.001), lung (EBI = 0.01; p = 0.019) and bladder (EBI = 0.007; p = 0.05) cancers. After introduction of the Townsend index, SaTScan failed in finding cancers clusters. This introduction changed the results obtained with the other methods. SpODT identified five spatial classes (p < 0.05): four in the Western and one in the Northern parts of the study area (standardized incidence ratios: 1.68, 1.39, 1.14, 1.12, and 1.16, respectively). In the univariate setting, the Bayesian smoothing method found the same clusters as the two other methods (RR >1.2). The multivariate HBSM found a spatial correlation between lung and bladder cancers (r = 0.6).  Conclusions:   In spatial analysis of cancer incidence, SpODT and HBSM may be used not only for cluster detection but also for searching for confounding or etiological factors in small areas. Moreover, the multivariate HBSM offers a flexible and meaningful modeling of spatial variations; it shows plausible previously unknown associations between various cancers.""","""['Juste Aristide Goungounga', 'Jean Gaudart', 'Marc Colonna', 'Roch Giorgi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['How to interpret and choose a Bayesian spatial model and a Poisson regression model in the context of describing small area cancer risks variations.', 'Small-area geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in colorectal tumour detection in France.', 'Cancer incidence in men: a cluster analysis of spatial patterns.', 'Spatial autocorrelation of cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia.', 'Spatial and temporal variations of childhood cancers: Literature review and contribution of the French national registry.', 'Characteristics of Composite Deprivation Indices Used in Public Health: A Scoping Review Protocol.', 'Area-Level Determinants in Colorectal Cancer Spatial Clustering Studies: A Systematic Review.', ""Do 'environmental bads' such as alcohol, fast food, tobacco, and gambling outlets cluster and co-locate in more deprived areas in Glasgow City, Scotland?"", 'A generic method for improving the spatial interoperability of medical and ecological databases.', 'Effect of a new motorway on social-spatial patterning of road traffic accidents: A retrospective longitudinal natural experimental study.']"""

The present study compared long-term QOL in MIBC patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) versus bladder-sparing trimodality therapy (TMT).  Methods and materials:   This cross-sectional bi-institutional study identified 226 patients with nonmetastatic cT2-cT4 MIBC, diagnosed in 1990 to 2011, who were eligible for RC and were disease free for ≥2 years. Six validated QOL instruments were administered: EuroQOL EQ-5D, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and EORTC MIBC module, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite bowel scale, Cancer Treatment and Perception Scale, and Impact of Cancer, version 2. Multivariable analyses of the mean QOL scores were conducted using propensity score matching.  Results:   The response rate was 77% (n=173). The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Of the 173 patients, 64 received TMT and 109, RC. The median interval from diagnosis to questionnaire completion was 9 years after TMT and 7 years after RC (P=.009). No significant differences were found in age, gender, comorbidities, tobacco history, performance status, or tumor stage. On multivariable analysis, patients who received TMT had better general QOL by 9.7 points of 100 compared with those who had received RC (P=.001) and higher physical, role, social, emotional, and cognitive functioning by 6.6 to 9.9 points (P≤.04). TMT was associated with better bowel function by 4.5 points (P=.02) and fewer bowel symptoms by 2.7 to 7.1 points (P≤.05). The urinary symptom scores were similar. TMT was associated with better sexual function by 8.7 to 32.1 points (P≤.02) and body image by 14.8 points (P<.001). The patients who underwent TMT reported greater informed decision-making scores by 13.6 points (P=.01) and less concern about the negative effect of cancer by 6.8 points (P=.006). The study limitations included missing baseline QOL data and different follow-up times.  Conclusions:   Both TMT and RC result in good long-term QOL outcomes in MIBC survivors, supporting TMT as a good alternative to RC for selected patients.

However, natural or acquired resistance of tumors to known PARP-1 inhibitors poses a serious problem for their clinical implementation. Present study aims to reignite clinical interest to PARP-1 inhibitors by introducing a new method of identifying highly potent inhibitors and presenting the largest known collection of structurally diverse inhibitors. The majority of PARP-1 inhibitors known to date have been developed as NAD competitors. NAD is utilized by many enzymes other than PARP-1, resulting in a trade-off trap between their specificity and efficacy. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a new strategy to blindly screen a small molecule library for PARP-1 inhibitors by targeting a highly specific rout of its activation. Based on this screen, we present a collection of PARP-1 inhibitors and provide their structural classification. In addition to compounds that show structural similarity to NAD or known PARP-1 inhibitors, the screen identified structurally new non-NAD-like inhibitors that block PARP-1 activity in cancer cells with greater efficacy and potency than classical PARP-1 inhibitors currently used in clinic. These non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors are effective against several types of human cancer xenografts, including kidney, prostate, and breast tumors in vivo. Our pre-clinical testing of these inhibitors using laboratory animals has established a strong foundation for advancing the new inhibitors to clinical trials.""","""['Colin Thomas', 'Yingbiao Ji', 'Niraj Lodhi', 'Elena Kotova', 'Aaron Dan Pinnola', 'Konstantin Golovine', 'Peter Makhov', 'Kate Pechenkina', 'Vladimir Kolenko', 'Alexei V Tulin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors in prostate cancer treatment.', 'High-Throughput Colorimetric Assay for Identifying PARP-1 Inhibitors Using a Large Small-Molecule Collection.', 'An Update on Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) Inhibitors: Opportunities and Challenges in Cancer Therapy.', 'Discovery and SAR study of 2-(1-propylpiperidin-4-yl)-3H-imidazo4,5-cpyridine-7-carboxamide: A potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) for the treatment of cancer.', 'Histone-dependent PARP-1 inhibitors: A novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of prostate and renal cancers.', 'PARP Inhibitors: Clinical Limitations and Recent Attempts to Overcome Them.', 'DNA Methylation Malleability and Dysregulation in Cancer Progression: Understanding the Role of PARP1.', 'Unconventional metabolites in chromatin regulation.', 'Poly(ADP)-Ribosylation Inhibition: A Promising Approach for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy.', 'SARS-CoV-2: Understanding the Transcriptional Regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the Role of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) at Codon 72 of p53 in the Innate Immune Response against Virus Infection.']"""

Methods and materials:   Two hundred and forty-five patients with elevated PSA underwent multiparametric (mp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate before biopsy. mpMRI was performed using a 3 T MRI system without an endorectal coil. Patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic 12 core biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy (n=68), radiation therapy (n=91), or clinical follow-up for at least 2 years (n=86). csPC was defined as Gleason score ≥3+4 and/or tumour volume of ≥0.5 ml, and/or tumour stage ≥T3a.

Results:   In 144 patients (58.8%), csPC was found within 2 years after MRI. With scoring according to the PI-RADSv2 guidelines, DCE was not needed for determination of the overall assessment category in 80.8% (198/245) of patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.85) for PI-RADSv2 and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85) for PI-RADSv2Alt.

They present a potential for abuse in sports and food-producing animals as an interesting alternative to anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS). These compounds are easily available and could therefore be (mis)used in livestock production as growth promoters. To prevent such practices, dedicated analytical strategies should be developed for specific and sensitive detection of these compounds in biological matrices. The present study focused on Bicalutamide, a non-steroidal SARM used in human treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer because of its anti-androgenic activity exhibiting no anti-anabolic effects. To select the most appropriate matrix to be used for control purposes, different animal matrices (urine and faeces) have been investigated and SARM metabolism studied to highlight relevant metabolites of such treatments and establish associated detection time windows. The aim of this work was thus to compare the urinary and faecal eliminations of bicalutamide in a calf, and investigate phase I and II metabolites. The results in both matrices showed that bicalutamide was very rapidly and mainly excreted under its free form. The concentration levels were observed as higher in faeces (ppm) than urine (ppb); although both matrices were assessed as suitable for residue control.

However, the mechanism of solanine-suppressing prostate cancer cell growth remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the inhibition mechanism of solanine on cancer development in vivo and in cultured human prostate cancer cell DU145 in vitro. Results show that solanine injection significantly suppresses the tumor cell growth in xenograft athymic nude mice. Solanine regulates the protein levels of cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and P21 in vivo and in vitro. Also, in cultured DU145 cell, solanine significantly inhibits cell growth. Moreover, the administration of NAC, an active oxygen scavenger, markedly reduces solanine-induced cell death. Blockade of P38 MAPK kinase cannot suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS), but can suppress solanine-induced cell apoptosis. Also, inhibition of ROS by NAC inactivates P38 pathway.

Materials and methods:   A Markov cohort model was developed to assess three scenarios: 1) no mpMRI and current AS; 2) mpMRI and current AS; and 3) mpMRI and increased AS. Men were tracked from diagnosis to end-of-life. Estimates to populate the model were derived from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, epidemiological publications, and national cost reports. An Australian Government perspective was used. Outcomes included healthcare costs, survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of biopsies, and significant and insignificant cancers. Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address possible variation in the modeled inputs.  Results:   Mean lifetime costs per patient were AU$23,191 for Scenario 1, AU$23,387 for Scenario 2 and AU$21,064 for Scenario 3. Corresponding QALYs were 7.81, 7.77, 7.83 for Scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At the current uptake of AS in Australia, mpMRI alone does not appear cost-effective (16.9% likelihood). However, mpMRI with AS for all men with low-risk disease is strongly cost-effective (86.9% likelihood) at a willingness-to-pay AU$50,000 per QALY gained. For the mpMRI options, for every 1000 men suspected of prostate cancer, using mpMRI would avoid 340 biopsies, detect an additional 20 significant cancers, and detect 10 fewer insignificant cancers.  Conclusion:   Diagnosis of prostate cancer through mpMRI technology would be cost-effective if it leads to increased uptake of AS for men with confirmed very-low- or low-risk prostate cancer.

It shows however limits in the case of deep cancers, favoring tumor recurrence under suboptimal conditions. More insight into the molecular mechanisms of PDT-induced cytotoxicity and cytoprotection is essential to extend and strengthen this therapeutic modality. As PDT induces iNOS/NO in both tumor and microenvironment, we examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in cytotoxicity and cytoprotection. Our findings show that NO mediates its cellular effects by acting on the NF-κB/YY1/RKIP loop, which controls cell growth and apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of PDT-induced NO is observed at low NO levels, which activate the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic NF-κB and YY1, while inhibiting the anti-survival/pro-apoptotic and metastasis suppressor RKIP. In contrast, high PDT-induced NO levels inhibit NF-κB and YY1 and induce RKIP, resulting in significant anti-tumor activity. These findings reveal a critical role played by NO in PDT and suggest that the use of bifunctional PDT agents composed of a photosensitizer and a NO-donor could enhance the photo-treatment effect. A successful application of NO in anticancer therapy requires control of its concentration in the target tissue. To address this issue we propose as PDT agent, a bimolecular conjugate called DR2, composed of a photosensitizer (Pheophorbide a) and a non-steroidal anti-androgen molecule capable of releasing NO under the exclusive control of light. The mechanism of action of DR2 in prostate cancer cells is reported and discussed.""","""['Valentina Rapozzi', 'Greta Varchi', 'Emilia Della Pietra', 'Claudia Ferroni', 'Luigi E Xodo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Dual roles of nitric oxide in the regulation of tumor cell response and resistance to photodynamic therapy.', 'Role of NF-κB/Snail/RKIP loop in the response of tumor cells to photodynamic therapy.', 'Nitric oxide-mediated activity in anti-cancer photodynamic therapy.', 'Dual role of NO donors in the reversal of tumor cell resistance and EMT: Downregulation of the NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP circuitry.', 'Repeated sub-optimal photodynamic treatments with pheophorbide a induce an epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells via nitric oxide.', 'Conjugates of Tetrapyrrolic Macrocycles as Potential Anticancer Target-Oriented Photosensitizers.', 'Insights of RKIP-Derived Suppression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Intracellular imaging of metmyoglobin and oxygen using new dual purpose probe EYFP-Myoglobin-mCherry.', 'Nitric Oxide Photo-Donor Hybrids of Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin: A Shift in Activity from Antimicrobial to Anticancer Agents.', 'Light-Induced Therapies for Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

We aim to clarify the associations of vitamin D with prostate volume.  Methods:   This is an observational study investigating the associations of serum PSA, PSA density and prostate volume with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) in PCa patients and men with negative biopsies seen in outpatient urology clinics in Chicago, IL, USA. There were 571 men (40-79 years old) with elevated PSA or abnormal digital rectal examination with available prostate volume recorded from initial biopsy. The primary outcomes were the unadjusted associations of serum 25-OH D deficiency with prostate volume. The secondary outcomes were the adjusted associations using linear and logistic regression analysis.  Results:   On univariate analysis, serum 25-OH D<20 ng ml-1 inversely correlated with prostate volume among all men undergoing transrectal ultrasonography (P=0.02), and this relationship remained significant for men with negative biopsy on stratified analysis. In adjusted models, controlling for age, serum PSA, 5-α reductase inhibitors use, obesity and PCa diagnosis, prostate volume was inversely associated with vitamin D (P<0.05) using serum vitamin D as a continuous and categorical variable. Logistic regression model also demonstrated an inverse association between vitamin D (continuous and categorical) and prostate volume ⩾40 grams.  Conclusion:   Serum 25-OH D levels are inversely associated with overall prostate volume and enlarged prostate gland (⩾40 grams), especially in men with benign prostatic disease.

However, the serum PSA measurement alone is insufficient for accurate diagnoses because the correlation with cancer is weak within the gray zone-the biomarker level range wherein a clear-cut diagnosis is impossible. As such, accurate prostate cancer diagnosis has been supplemented by measurements of the ratio of two types of PSA: free PSA (fPSA) and complexed PSA (cPSA; α-1-antichymotrypsin-bound PSA). Herein, we describe a new method for measuring the ratio of these two types of PSA by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and biochips. Both types of PSA in a sample are captured by the antibody immobilized on a biochip based on self-assembled monolayers on gold. fPSA and cPSA on the biochip are then distinguished by AuNPs that present antibodies against fPSA and cPSA, respectively. The presence of PSAs in a sample is detected with laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by observing reporter molecules, called amplification tags (Am-tags), on the AuNPs. One of the reporter molecules is an Am-tag without isotope labeling, and the other is a deuterium-labeled Am-tag (dAm-tag). These tags amplify mass signals so as to enhance the sensitivity of the method. A comparison of the mass intensities between the Am-tag and dAm-tag signals allows the determination of the ratio between fPSA and cPSA. We validated the selective measurement of fPSA and cPSA at different ratios in 50, 75, and 100 pM of total PSA (fPSA + cPSA) solutions corresponding to the gray zone in prostate-cancer diagnosis (4 - 10 ng/mL). Finally, the two types of PSA were spiked in fetal bovine serum at various ratios, and our strategy greatly afforded their accurate ratios as spiked based on a constructed calibration curve. These results clearly indicate that the strategy is applicable to human serum as a diagnostic and prognostic assay for prostate cancer.""","""['Minyoung Yoo', 'Woon-Seok Yeo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anal Sci""","""['Comparison of the clinical validity of free prostate-specific antigen, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin-bound prostate-specific antigen and complexed prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Generation of PSA-ACT-specific monoclonal antibodies and their application in a sandwich immunoassay.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer on repeat prostatic biopsy in men with serum total prostate-specific antigen between 4.1 and 10 ng/mL.', 'Molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein 2 as possible indicators in prostatic carcinoma diagnosis.', 'Molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein 2 as promising tools for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Screening the active compounds of Phellodendri Amurensis cortex for treating prostate cancer by high-throughput chinmedomics.']"""

Such information may help identify patients who would likely benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy rather than active surveillance. A multiplex proteomic assay, previously tested on biopsies and found to be predictive of favorable or unfavorable pathology at radical prostatectomy, was assessed for its predictive value to identify patients at higher risk for biochemical relapse.  Materials and methods:   Proteomic assays from core needle biopsies of 288 men who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy at CHUM (Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal) were evaluated for the prediction of subsequent biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Of the 288 men, biochemical relapse was observed in 47 (16.3%) and metastases were found in 5 (1.7%). Median followup was 68.5 months. The proteomic assay clearly separated patients into 3 categories, including those at low, intermediate and high risk for biochemical relapse (p = 0.0007). Assay scores predicted biochemical relapse on univariate analysis (HR 1.724, p = 0.0002 per 20% change in score), significantly better than other preoperative prognostic parameters. Additionally, the assay score had a significantly higher p value when combined with clinical National Comprehensive Cancer Network® stage compared to stage alone (HR 1.579, p = 0.0017 per 20% change in score).  Conclusions:   A protein based assay score derived from diagnostic needle biopsy has strong predictive ability for biochemical relapse after surgery.

The aim of this study was to identify those patient characteristics that most influence the impairment of quality of life and thus to identify those patients who need and can benefit most from specific intervention treatment.  Methods:   1879 cancer patients were given the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire at the beginning and end of their inpatient rehabilitation. Patients' scores were compared to those of 2081 healthy adults (Schwarz and Hinz, Eur J Cancer 37:1345-1351, 2001). Furthermore, differences in quality of life corresponding to sex, age, tumor site, TNM stage, interval between diagnosis and rehabilitation, and therapy method were examined.  Results:   Compared to the healthy population, the study group showed a decreased quality of life in all analyzed domains. This difference diminished with increasing age. Women reported a lower quality of life then men in general. Patients with prostate cancer showed the least impairment in several domains. Patients having undergone chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy were impaired the most. Surprisingly, TNM stage and interval between diagnosis and rehabilitation did not significantly influence quality of life. Global quality of life and all functional domains significantly improved after a 3-week rehabilitation program.  Conclusions:   Despite an individualized and increasingly better tolerable therapy, the quality of life of cancer patients is still considerably impaired.

PolyRGD-AC was derived from a random copolymer of tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA) and oligomeric (ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA), synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Acid hydrolysis of tert-butyl moieties revealed the carboxylates, through which acrylate groups were installed. Partial modification of the acrylate groups with a cysteine-containing RGD peptide generated PolyRGD-AC. When PolyRGD-AC was mixed with HA-SH under physiological conditions, a macroscopic hydrogel with an average elastic modulus of 630 Pa was produced. LNCaP prostate cancer cells encapsulated in HA-PolyRGD gels as dispersed single cells formed multicellular tumoroids by day 4 and reached an average diameter of ∼95 μm by day 28. Cells in these structures were viable, formed cell-cell contacts through E-cadherin (E-CAD), and displayed cortical organization of F-actin. Compared with the control gels prepared using PolyRDG, multivalent presentation of the RGD signal in the HA matrix increased cellular metabolism, promoted the development of larger tumoroids, and enhanced the expression of E-CAD and integrins.

Mystery-caller methods have been used previously to measure access to care for health services such as primary care, where patients' self-initiate requests for care. We used a mystery-caller survey for specialized prostate cancer care to assess dimensions of access to prostate cancer care.  Materials and methods:   We created an inventory of urology and radiation oncology practices in southeastern Pennsylvania. Using a 'mystery caller' approach, a research assistant posing as a medical office scheduler in a primary care office, attempted to make a new patient appointment on behalf of a referred patient. Linear regression was used to determine the association between time to next available appointment with practice and census tract characteristics.  Results:   We successfully obtained information on new patient appointments from 198 practices out of the 223 in the region (88.8%). Radiation oncology practices were more likely to accept Medicaid compared to urology practices (91.3% vs 36.4%) and had shorter mean wait times for new patient appointments (9.0 vs 12.8 days).

Dynamic Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (DCE-US) is a diagnostic tool that is suitable for analysis of vascularization, by imaging an intravenously injected microbubble bolus. The localization of angiogenic vascularization associated with the development of tumors is of particular interest. Recently, methods for the analysis of the bolus convective dispersion process have shown promise to localize angiogenesis. However, independent estimation of dispersion was not possible due to the ambiguity between convection and dispersion. Therefore, in this study we propose a new method that considers the vascular network as a dynamic linear system, whose impulse response can be locally identified. To this end, model-based parameter estimation is employed, that permits extraction of the apparent dispersion coefficient (D), velocity (v), and Péclet number (Pe) of the system. Clinical evaluation using data recorded from 25 patients shows that the proposed method can be applied effectively to DCE-US, and is able to locally characterize the hemodynamics, yielding promising results (receiver-operating-characteristic curve area of 0.84) for prostate cancer localization.""","""['Ruud Jg van Sloun', 'Libertario Demi', 'Arnoud W Postema', 'Jean Jmch de la Rosette', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Massimo Mischi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Convective-Dispersion Modeling in 3D Contrast-Ultrasound Imaging for the Localization of Prostate Cancer.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Angiogenesis Imaging by Mutual Information Analysis for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Contrast-ultrasound diffusion imaging for localization of prostate cancer.', 'New developments in ultrasonography for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast specific imaging in the detection and localization of prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetic modeling of PSMA-targeted nanobubbles for quantification of extravasation and binding in mice models of prostate cancer.', 'Alternatives for MRI in Prostate Cancer Diagnostics-Review of Current Ultrasound-Based Techniques.', 'Experimental acoustic characterization of an endoskeletal antibubble contrast agent: First results.', 'Advanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with dispersion analysis for the localization of prostate cancer: correlation with radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

The first step usually consists of identifying candidate genes; to find out which pathways are affected by those genes, however, functional analysis (FA) is mandatory. The most frequently used strategies for this purpose are Gene Set and Singular Enrichment Analysis (GSEA and SEA) over Gene Ontology. Several statistical methods have been developed and compared in terms of computational efficiency and/or statistical appropriateness. However, whether their results are similar or complementary, the sensitivity to parameter settings, or possible bias in the analyzed terms has not been addressed so far. Here, two GSEA and four SEA methods and their parameter combinations were evaluated in six datasets by comparing two breast cancer subtypes with well-known differences in genetic background and patient outcomes. We show that GSEA and SEA lead to different results depending on the chosen statistic, model and/or parameters. Both approaches provide complementary results from a biological perspective. Hence, an Integrative Functional Analysis (IFA) tool is proposed to improve information retrieval in FA. It provides a common gene expression analytic framework that grants a comprehensive and coherent analysis. Only a minimal user parameter setting is required, since the best SEA/GSEA alternatives are integrated.

Recent studies showed regulation of DNA repair genes by androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancers. ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) is an androgen-regulated tumor suppressor and its intracellular localization can be modulated by ultraviolet light, suggesting a potential role for EAF2 in androgen regulation of DNA repair in prostate cancer cells. Here we show that knockdown of EAF2 or its homolog EAF1 sensitized prostate cancer cells to DNA damage and the sensitization did not require p53. EAF2 knockout mouse prostate was also sensitized to γ-irradiation. Furthermore, EAF2 knockdown blocked androgen repression of LNCaP or C4-2 cells from doxorubicin induction of γH2ax, a DNA damage marker. In human prostate cancer specimens, EAF2 expression was inversely correlated with the level of γH2ax. Further analysis showed that EAF2 and EAF1 are required for the recruitment and retention of Ku70/Ku80 to DNA damage sites and play a functional role in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair.

The burden is expected to grow 1.7 million new cases and 499,000 new deaths by 2030. In developing countries such as India, prostate carcinoma will show an increase by 140% in the next few years. Although the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma can usually be made on histological features, now a days many immunohistochemical (IHC) markers are used to distinguish it from benign mimickers as well as in predicting prognosis and treatment. Out of these markers, Ets-related gene (ERG product) is a proto-oncogene which participates in chromosomal translocations and is frequently over expressed in prostate carcinoma which harbors ERG-transmembrane protease, serine 2 fusion.  Materials and methods:   Fifty cases of carcinoma prostate diagnosed in needle biopsies and prostatic chips, in the Department of Pathology of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Punjab, India, were included in the present study. The slides were observed under the light microscope, and Gleason scoring was done using the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology modified Gleason system. IHC study for ERG expression was done on all the cases, for which anti-ERG monoclonal rabbit clone antibody EP111 (Dako, Denmark) was used. Lymphocytes and endothelial cells were taken as in built positive controls for staining. The intensity of ERG positivity was scored as no staining (0), weak staining (+1), moderate staining (+2) and intense staining (+3). The H score was then calculated by multiplying the intensity of the stain with the percentage (0-100) of the cells showing that staining intensity. The H-score has a range of 0-300. The relationship between IHC expression and clinico-pathological parameters was compared and analyzed using Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Majority of patients included in the study were in the age group of 61-80 (84% of the total). When ERG expression was studied with age-specific rates, it was not found to be statistically significant. The most common pattern noted in the present study was 4 + 3, constituting 36% of total, followed by 3 + 4 constituting 32%. Calculating the score, the majority of patients had a Gleason score of 5-8, constituting 76% of total. Out of the total fifty cases of prostate carcinoma, ERG was positive in 29 cases (58%) and negative in 21 cases (42%). Fourteen out of 21 (48%) of the ERG positive cases had an intensity score of 3. When the ERG intensity was correlated with the Gleason score group, it was seen that patients having Gleason score 7-8 showed ERG positivity in 19 out of 38 cases (50%), with 11/19 (57%) cases showing an ERG intensity score of 3. The Gleason score group 9-10 showed ERG positivity in 83% (10/12) cases, 20% (2/10) cases showing intensity score of 3. This correlation was found to be statistically significant.  Conclusion:   ERG immunostaining was performed in a small Indian cohort of prostate cancer patients, diagnosed in trucut biopsy specimens and prostatic chips. ERG expression was found in 58% patients. An increase in the ERG expression was observed with an increase in Gleason score.

Percent changes in prostate volume (PV) were assessed for 5 years after baseline measurements. Associations between prostate growth and change in weight, WC and MetS status, respectively, were calculated using uni- and multivariate linear regression analyses.  Results:   During the 5 years, the median PV changes were 1.3 cc/year corresponding to a median growth rate of 6.2%/year. By multivariate linear regression analysis, change in weight was significantly associated with prostate growth (P < .01) after adjusting for age, initial PV, and initial body mass index (BMI).

In the present study, we evaluated cytotoxic effects of these DIMN derivatives and found that DIMN-26 most potently inhibited the proliferation of the LNCap-LN3 androgen-dependent and DU145 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. The G2/M phase arrest was found due to increases in the activation of cdc2 (also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 1, CDK1)/cyclin B1 complex. DIMN-26 also induced apoptosis in LNCap-LN3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells through activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). In addition, DIMN-26 caused the dephosphorylation and mitochondrial accumulation of Bad protein and induced the loss of mitochondria membrane potential, consequently releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol of the cell. Furthermore, overexpression of AKT protein significantly reduced DIMN-26-induced PARP-1 cleavage and p-Bad decrease and cdc2 activation. In addition, DIMN-26 inhibited the 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced cell growth and proliferation and nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities of androgen receptor (AR) in LNCap-LN3 prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these findings, DIMN-26 significantly inhibited the DHT-induced expression of AR-response genes (ARGs), such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), AR, β2-microglobulin (B2M), selenoprotein P (SEPP1), and ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in LNCap-LN3 prostate cancer cells.

Methods and materials:   Population included 1336 patients, 3-year minimum follow-up, treated with 66-80Gy. Toxicity was scored with LENT-SOMA-scale. Two toxicity endpoints were considered: grade ⩾2 rectal pain and mean grade (average score during follow-up) in stool frequency >1. DVHs of anorectum were reduced to equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The best-value of the volume parameter n was determined through numerical optimization. Association between EUD/clinical factors and the endpoints was investigated by logistic analyses.

Objective:   To determine outcomes for men diagnosed with advanced PCa following prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing who were excluded from the ProtecT randomised trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   Mortality was compared for 492 men followed up for a median of 7.4 yr to a contemporaneous cohort of men from the UK Anglia Cancer Network (ACN) and with a matched subset from the ACN.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCa-specific and all-cause mortality were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox's proportional hazards regression.  Results and limitations:   Of the 492 men excluded from the ProtecT cohort, 37 (8%) had metastases (N1, M0=5, M1=32) and 305 had locally advanced disease (62%). The median PSA was 17μg/l. Treatments included radical prostatectomy (RP; n=54; 11%), radiotherapy (RT; n=245; 50%), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; n=122; 25%), other treatments (n=11; 2%), and unknown (n=60; 12%). There were 49 PCa-specific deaths (10%), of whom 14 men had received radical treatment (5%); and 129 all-cause deaths (26%). In matched ProtecT and ACN cohorts, 37 (9%) and 64 (16%), respectively, died of PCa, while 89 (22%) and 103 (26%) died of all causes. ProtecT men had a 45% lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.83; p=0.0037), but mortality was similar in those treated radically. The nonrandomised design is a limitation.  Conclusions:   Men with PSA-detected advanced PCa excluded from ProtecT and treated radically had low rates of PCa death at 7.4-yr follow-up. Among men who underwent nonradical treatment, the ProtecT group had a lower rate of PCa death. Early detection through PSA testing, leadtime bias, and group heterogeneity are possible factors in this finding.  Patient summary:   Prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate gland without causing symptoms can be detected via prostate-specific antigen testing and treated, leading to low rates of death from this disease.""","""['Thomas J Johnston', 'Greg L Shaw', 'Alastair D Lamb', 'Deepak Parashar', 'David Greenberg', 'Tengbin Xiong', 'Alison L Edwards', 'Vincent Gnanapragasam', 'Peter Holding', 'Phillipa Herbert', 'Michael Davis', 'Elizabeth Mizielinsk', 'J Athene Lane', 'Jon Oxley', 'Mary Robinson', 'Malcolm Mason', 'John Staffurth', 'Prasad Bollina', 'James Catto', 'Andrew Doble', 'Alan Doherty', 'David Gillatt', 'Roger Kockelbergh', 'Howard Kynaston', 'Steve Prescott', 'Alan Paul', 'Philip Powell', 'Derek Rosario', 'Edward Rowe', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'David E Neal;ProtecT study group']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['What Early ProtecT Results Have Confirmed About Risk-stratified Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Re: Mortality among Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer Excluded from\xa0the\xa0ProtecT Trial.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Objective:   The European School of Oncology Task Force (ESO TF) aimed to identify a core set of research questions and related measures to include in AS HRQoL studies.  Design, setting, and participants:   A modified Delphi study was used to reach consensus on AS HRQoL research topics and tools between 2014 and 2015. Data were collected by engaging a multidisciplinary team of 15 experts.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   An open-ended questionnaire was used to collect information from ESO TF members regarding issues in AS HRQoL research. Then a structured questionnaire was used to collect ratings on the usefulness/importance of different AS HRQoL aspects. Items that ≥80% of ESO TF members rated as useful/important were retained. Items with a 50-80% rating were discussed to reach final agreement.  Results and limitations:   Six main research questions concerning the selection of outcome measures, measurement tools, and comparison groups were identified as relevant. The core set of measures identified were related to individual characteristics, psychological dimensions; decision-making-related issues, and physical functioning. The multidisciplinary expertise of ESO TF members was a significant asset, even if bringing different backgrounds to the discussion table represented a challenge.  Conclusions:   HRQoL measures have to be sensitive to the specific needs of men on AS. The definition of HRQoL outcomes will enhance a broader understanding of the HRQoL of men on AS and sustain patient-centered medicine.

Objective:   To evaluate the ability of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to achieve local control of the tumor in patients with unilateral localized prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   The French Urological Association initiated a prospective IDEAL multi-institutional study (2009-2015), to evaluate HIFU-hemiablation as a primary treatment.  Intervention:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy were used for unilateral cancer diagnosis and control, and HIFU-hemiablation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary: absence of clinically significant cancer (CSC) on control biopsy at 1 yr (CSC: Gleason score ≥ 7 or cancer core length>3mm regardless of grade or > 2 positive cores). Secondary: presence of any cancer on biopsy, biochemical response, radical treatment free survival, adverse events, continence (no pad), erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function-5 ≥ 16), and quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C28) questionnaires.  Results and limitations:   One hundred and eleven patients were treated (mean age: 64.8 yr [standard deviation 6.2]; mean prostate-specific antigen: 6.2 ng/ml [standard deviation 2.6]; 68% low risk, 32% intermediate risk). Of the 101 patients with control biopsy, 96 (95%) and 94 (93%) had no CSC in the treated and contralateral lobes, respectively. Mean prostate-specific antigen at 2 yr was 2.3 ng/ml (standard deviation 1.7). The radical treatment-free survival rate at 2 years was 89% (radical treatments: six radical prostatectomies, three radiotherapies, and two HIFU). Adverse events were Grade 3 in 13%. At 12 mo continence and erectile functions were preserved in 97% and 78%. No significant decrease in quality of life score was observed at 12 mo. One limitation is the number of low-risk patients included in this study.  Conclusions:   At 1 yr, HIFU-hemiablation was efficient with 95% absence of clinically significant cancer associated with low morbidity and preservation of quality of life. Radical treatment-free survival rate was 89% at 2 yr.

Methods and materials:   A total of 2,339 subjects were available for the analyses. Rectal toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.  Results:   The 3-year cumulative incidence for grade ≥2 rectal toxicity was 2.88%, 1.76%, and 6.53% in all subjects, PI group and EBRT combination therapy group, respectively. On multivariate analysis, among all subjects, grade ≥2 rectal toxicity was associated with rectal volumes receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (R100; p < 0.0001) and EBRT combination therapy (p = 0.0066). R100 in the PI group (p = 0.0254), and R100 (p = 0.0011) and interactive planning (p = 0.0267) in the EBRT combination therapy group were also associated with grade ≥2 toxicity. The 3-year cumulative incidence of grade ≥2 rectal toxicity was 3.80% and 1.37% for R100 ≥ 1 mL and R100 < 1 mL, respectively, in the PI group (p = 0.0068), and 14.09% and 5.52% for R100 ≥ 1 mL and R100 < 1 mL, respectively, in the EBRT combination therapy group (p = 0.0070).  Conclusions:   Rectal toxicity was relatively rare in this study compared with previous reports.

The delineation of the prostate on CT images, however, represents a challenge due to the lack of soft-tissue contrast to identify the prostate borders. This study aims at quantifying the sensitivity of prostate V100 and D90 to contouring uncertainty as clinically relevant parameters for evaluation of target coverage in postimplant dosimetry.  Methods and materials:   CT images, postoperative plans, and contours of a cohort of patients (n = 43; low risk = 55.8%, intermediate risk = 39.5%, high risk = 4.7%), who had received prostate seed brachytherapy, were imported into MIM Symphony treatment planning system. The prostate contours in postimplant CT images were expanded or contracted uniformly in extents of ±1.00 mm, ±2.00 mm, ±3.00 mm, ±4.00 mm, and ±5.00 mm. The values for V100 and D90 were extracted from dose-volume histograms for each contour and compared.  Results:   Significant changes were observed in the values of D90 and V100 as well as the number of inacceptable plans for expansion or contraction of only few millimeters. Evaluation of a plan coverage based on D90 was found to be less sensitive to systematic contouring errors compared with V100. Number of plans incorrectly identified for lack or adequacy of coverage is lower using D90 compared with V100 for the same margin of error.  Conclusions:   Evaluation of a plan coverage based on V100 is too sensitive to systematic contouring errors of prostate. D90 increases the accuracy of CT-based postimplant quality assurance in identifying plans with insufficient coverage compared with V100.""","""['Shahram Mashouf', 'Habib Safigholi', 'Tomas Merino', 'Abraam Soliman', 'Ananth Ravi', 'Gerard Morton', 'William Y Song']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Correlation between real-time intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry and its implications on intraoperative planning.', 'Correlation between pre- and postimplant dosimetry for iodine-125 seed implants for localized prostate cancer.', 'The effect of interobserver variability on transrectal ultrasonography-based postimplant dosimetry.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

We used time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to determine the true cost of low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for prostate cancer and demonstrate opportunities for cost containment at an academic referral center.  Methods and materials:   We implemented TDABC for patients treated with I-125, preplanned LDR and computed tomography based HDR brachytherapy with two implants from initial consultation through 12-month followup. We constructed detailed process maps for provision of both HDR and LDR. Personnel, space, equipment, and material costs of each step were identified and used to derive capacity cost rates, defined as price per minute. Each capacity cost rate was then multiplied by the relevant process time and products were summed to determine total cost of care.  Results:   The calculated cost to deliver HDR was greater than LDR by $2,668.86 ($9,538 vs. $6,869). The first and second HDR treatment day cost $3,999.67 and $3,955.67, whereas LDR was delivered on one treatment day and cost $3,887.55. The greatest overall cost driver for both LDR and HDR was personnel at 65.6% ($4,506.82) and 67.0% ($6,387.27) of the total cost. After personnel costs, disposable materials contributed the second most for LDR ($1,920.66, 28.0%) and for HDR ($2,295.94, 24.0%).  Conclusions:   With TDABC, the true costs to deliver LDR and HDR from the health system perspective were derived. Analysis by physicians and hospital administrators regarding the cost of care afforded redesign opportunities including delivering HDR as one implant.

We examine the relationship of oral microbiota with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer in a large nested case-control study.  Design:   We selected 361 incident adenocarcinoma of pancreas and 371 matched controls from two prospective cohort studies, the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II and the National Cancer Institute Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

The associations between oral microbiota and risk of pancreatic cancer, controlling for the random effect of cohorts and other covariates, were examined using traditional and L1-penalised least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression.  Results:   Carriage of oral pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer (adjusted OR for presence vs absence=1.60 and 95% CI 1.15 to 2.22; OR=2.20 and 95% CI 1.16 to 4.18, respectively).

However, it is unclear if this association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. We conducted a Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate the causal effects of coffee consumption on prostate cancer risk and progression. We used two genetic variants robustly associated with caffeine intake (rs4410790 and rs2472297) as proxies for coffee consumption in a sample of 46,687 men of European ancestry from 25 studies in the PRACTICAL consortium. Associations between genetic variants and prostate cancer case status, stage and grade were assessed by logistic regression and with all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression. There was no clear evidence that a genetic risk score combining rs4410790 and rs2472297 was associated with prostate cancer risk (OR per additional coffee increasing allele: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98,1.03) or having high-grade compared to low-grade disease (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97,1.04).

We aimed to develop a gold nanoparticle (GNP)-conjugated anti-PSA antibody-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) as a novel approach to detect prostatic disease. A total of 25 nm colloidal gold particles were prepared followed by conjugation with anti-PSA pAb (GNPs-PSA pAb). LSPR was used to monitor the absorption changes of the aggregation of the particles. The size, shape and stability of the GNP-anti-PSA were evaluated by dynamic light scattering transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zetasizer. The GNPs-conjugated PSA-pAb was successfully synthesized and subsequently characterized using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and TEM to determine the size distribution, crystallinity and stability of the particles (for example, stability of GNP: 443 mV). To increase the stability of the particles, we pegylated GNPs using an N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N*-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) linker (for example, stability of GNP after pegylation: 272 mV). We found a significant increase in the absorbance and intensity of the particles with extinction peak at 545/2 nm, which was shifted by ~1 nm after conjugation. To illustrate the potential of the GNPs-PSA pAb to bind specifically to PSA, LSPR was used. We found that the extinction peak shifted 3 nm for a solution of 100 nM unlabeled antigen.

Methods:   Ten high-risk prostate cancer cases were included in this retrospective study. For each case, IMPT plans were generated using multiple field optimisation (MFO) technique (two fields) with XiO treatment planning system (TPS), whereas RapidArc plans were generated using double-arc technique (two full arcs) with Eclipse TPS. IMPT and RapidArc plans were optimised for a total prescription dose of 79.2 Gy (relative biological effectiveness (RBE)) and 79.2 Gy, respectively, using identical dose-volume constraints. IMPT and RapidArc plans were then normalised such that at least 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) received the prescription dose.  Results:   The mean and maximum PTV doses were comparable in IMPT plans (80.1 ± 0.3 Gy (RBE) and 82.6 ± 1.0 Gy (RBE) respectively) and RapidArc plans (80.3 ± 0.3 Gy and 82.8 ± 0.6 Gy respectively) with P = 0.088 and P = 0.499 respectively. The mean doses of the rectum and bladder were found to be significantly lower in IMPT plans (16.9 ± 5.8 Gy (RBE) and 17.5 ± 5.4 Gy (RBE) respectively) when compared to RapidArc plans (41.9 ± 5.7 Gy and 32.5 ± 7.8 Gy respectively) with P < 0.000 and P < 0.000 respectively. For the rectum, IMPT produced lower V30 (21.0 ± 9.6% vs. 68.5 ± 10.0%; P < 0.000), V50 (14.3 ± 5.8% vs. 45.0 ± 10.0%; P < 0.000) and V70 (6.9 ± 3.4% vs. 12.8 ± 3.6%; P < 0.000) compared to RapidArc. For the bladder, IMPT produced lower V30 (23.2 ± 7.0% vs. 50.9 ± 15.6%; P < 0.000) and V50 (16.6 ± 5.4% vs. 25.1 ± 9.6%; P = 0.001), but similar V70 (9.7 ± 3.5% vs. 10.5 ± 4.2%; P = 0.111) compared to RapidArc. RapidArc produced lower mean dose for both the right femoral head (19.5 ± 4.2 Gy vs. 27.4 ± 4.5 Gy (RBE); P < 0.000) and left femoral head (18.0 ± 4.3 Gy vs. 28.0 ± 5.6 Gy (RBE); P < 0.000). Both IMPT and RapidArc produced comparable bladder normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) (0.6 ± 0.2% vs. 0.5 ± 0.2%; P = 0.152). The rectal NTCP was found to be lower using IMPT (0.8 ± 0.7%) than using RapidArc (1.7 ± 0.7%) with P < 0.000.  Conclusion:   Both IMPT and RapidArc techniques provided comparable mean and maximum PTV doses. For the rectum, IMPT produced better dosimetric results in the low-, medium- and high-dose regions and lower NTCP compared to RapidArc.

To date, predictors of dyadic planning have not been systematically investigated. Integrating cognitive predictors of individual planning with four established predictor domains of social support provision, we propose a framework of predictors of dyadic planning. Including target persons' and partners' perspectives, we examine these predictor domains in the context of prostate cancer patients' rehabilitative pelvic floor exercise (PFE) following radical prostatectomy.  Design:   Longitudinal data from 175 patients and their partners were analysed in a study with four post-surgery assessments across 6 months.  Methods:   PFE-related dyadic planning was assessed from both partners together with indicators from four predictor domains: context, target person, partner, and relationship factors. Individual planning and social support served as covariates.  Results:   Findings from two-level models nesting repeated assessments in individuals showed that context (patients' incontinence), target person (i.e., positive affect and self-efficacy), and relationship factors (i.e., relationship satisfaction) were uniquely associated with dyadic planning, whereas partner factors (i.e., positive and negative affects) were not. Factors predicting patients' and partners' accounts of dyadic planning differed.  Conclusions:   Resembling prior findings on antecedents of support provision in this context, partner factors did not prevail as unique predictors of dyadic planning, whereas indicators from all other predictor domains did. To establish predictive direction, future work should use lagged predictions with shorter intermeasurement intervals. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Dyadic planning has been shown to be linked to health behaviour change. However, its role in behaviour regulation frameworks is not well investigated, especially regarding factors that might be predictive of dyadic planning. What does this study add? A framework of predictors of dyadic planning in the health behaviour change process is presented. The framework is investigated accounting for both planning partners' perspectives.

LncRNAs can regulate essential pathways that contribute to tumor initiation and progression with tissue specificity, which suggests that lncRNAs could be valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), also known as differential display code 3 (DD3), is one such lncRNA that maps to chromosome 9q21-22. PCA3 expression is highly specific to PCa. In the present study, the level of PCA3 expression in prostate cancer cells was reduced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Subsequently, the ability of LNCaP cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa was compromised both in vivo and in vitro with the occurrence of cell autophagy. Recently, a novel regulatory mechanism has been proposed in which RNAs cross talk via competing with the shared microRNAs (miRNAs). In addition, lncRNAs can directly interact with RNA-binding proteins and then bind to the gene promoter region to further regulate gene expression. The proposed competitive endogenous RNAs mediate the bioavailability of miRNAs on their targets, thus imposing another level of post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we demonstrated that binding of Snail to the promoter region of PCA3 could activate the expression of PCA3. Down-regulation of PCA3 by silencing could increase the expression of the miRNA-1261, which then targeted at the PRKD3 gene (protein kinase D3) through competitive sponging. In summary, these results suggest that the transcription factor, Snail, activated the expression of lncRNA PCA3, which could inhibit the translation of PRKD3 protein via competitive miR-1261 sponging, and thus high expression of PRKD3 further promoted invasion and migration of prostate cancer.""","""['Jin-Hua He', 'Bao-Xia Li', 'Ze-Ping Han', 'Mao-Xian Zou', 'Li Wang', 'Yu-Bing Lv', 'Jia-Bin Zhou', 'Ming-Rong Cao', 'Yu-Guang Li', 'Jing-Zhi Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Overexpression of Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 Inhibits Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Huh7 Cells via Negative Modulation of miRNA-664.', 'The role of long non-coding RNA PCA3 in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tumorigenesis and progression.', 'PCA3 long noncoding RNA modulates the expression of key cancer-related genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: differential display code 3 (DD3(PCA3)), a highly prostate cancer-specific gene.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'A validation study for the utility of serum microRNA as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with osteosarcoma.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'Transcriptional landscape of PTEN loss in primary prostate cancer.', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Ferroptosis is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through the circ0097009/miR-1261/SLC7A11 axis.']"""

Its relation to possible neuroendocrine differentiation remained unclear. We evaluated 11 SCLC cases with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. SCLC was characterized by crowded hyperchromatic small nuclei with scant cytoplasm, rosette-like structures, finely granular chromatin with indistinct nucleoli, and lack of mitoses, apoptoses, and necroses. In nine cases, SCLC was admixed with high-grade cancer, and in two cases, it represented a separate intraductal process, spatially remote from a low-volume Gleason score 6 (grade group 1) cancer. Only 2/11 SCLC labeled for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and serotonin, although 6/11 were at least focally positive for TTF1. Staining for NKX3.1 and pancytokeratin was typically weak, focal, and markedly reduced compared to the adjacent cancer. SCLC was positive for ERG in 1/8 and for racemase in 6/10 cases, again typically in a focal and weak fashion. There was no immunoreactivity with CD56, p63, or HMWCK.

In summary, SCLC is more frequently found in high-grade prostate cancer, but it may also be encountered as a noninvasive lesion in Gleason score 6 (grade group 1) cancer. Importantly, it does not appear to indicate neuroendocrine differentiation.

Background:   Self-identified black men have higher incidence and mortality from prostate cancer in the United States compared with white men but are dramatically underrepresented in clinical trials exploring novel therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   Black men with mCRPC were treated with abiraterone acetate (AA), 1,000 mg daily, and prednisone (P), 5 mg twice daily. The primary objective was to determine antitumor activity (defined by a ≥30% decline in prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level) and to correlate germline polymorphisms in androgen metabolism genes with antitumor activity. Secondary objectives included determining safety, post-treatment changes in measurable disease, and time to disease progression.  Results:   From April 2013 to March 2016, a total of 11 black men were enrolled and received AA plus P (AA+P); 7 of 10 evaluable patients were docetaxel naive. Post-treatment declines in PSA level of ≥30% were achieved in 90% of patients. The side effect profile was consistent with prior clinical trials exploring AA+P in mCRPC. Due to poor accrual, the study was closed prematurely with insufficient sample size for the planned pharmacogenetic analyses.  Conclusion:   In this small prospective study terminated for poor accrual, the safety and activity of AA+P in black men with mCRPC was similar to that reported in prior studies exploring AA in largely white populations.

Despite these disparities, African American men are underrepresented in clinical trials and in studies on PCa biology and biomarker discovery. We used immunoseroproteomics to profile antitumor autoantibody responses in AA and European American (EA) men with PCa, and explored differences in these responses. This minimally invasive approach detects autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens that could serve as clinical biomarkers and immunotherapeutic agents. Sera from AA and EA men with PCa were probed by immunoblotting against PC3 cell proteins, with AA sera showing stronger immunoreactivity. Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoreactive protein spots revealed that several AA sera contained autoantibodies to a number of proteins associated with both the glycolysis and plasminogen pathways, particularly to alpha-enolase (ENO1). The proteomic data is deposited in ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003968. Analysis of sera from 340 racially diverse men by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) showed higher frequency of anti-ENO1 autoantibodies in PCa sera compared with control sera. We observed differences between AA-PCa and EA-PCa patients in their immunoreactivity against ENO1. Although EA-PCa sera reacted with higher frequency against purified ENO1 in ELISA and recognized by immunoblotting the endogenous cellular ENO1 across a panel of prostate cell lines, AA-PCa sera reacted weakly against this protein by ELISA but recognized it by immunoblotting preferentially in metastatic cell lines. These race-related differences in immunoreactivity to ENO1 could not be accounted by differential autoantibody recognition of phosphoepitopes within this antigen. Proteomic analysis revealed differences in the posttranslational modification profiles of ENO1 variants differentially recognized by AA-PCa and EA-PCa sera. These intriguing results suggest the possibility of race-related differences in the antitumor autoantibody response in PCa, and have implications for defining novel biological determinants of PCa health disparities.""","""['Tino W Sanchez', 'Guangyu Zhang', 'Jitian Li', 'Liping Dai', 'Saied Mirshahidi', 'Nathan R Wall', 'Clayton Yates', 'Colwick Wilson', 'Susanne Montgomery', 'Jian-Ying Zhang', 'Carlos A Casiano']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Serological proteome analysis approach-based identification of ENO1 as a tumor-associated antigen and its autoantibody could enhance the sensitivity of CEA and CYFRA 21-1 in the detection of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Using Serological Proteome Analysis to Identify Serum Anti-Nucleophosmin 1 Autoantibody as a Potential Biomarker in European-American and African-American Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Plasma autoantibodies against heat shock protein 70, enolase 1 and ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 as potential biomarkers for cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Alpha-Enolase (ENO1), a potential target in novel immunotherapies.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'Serum Androgen Metabolites Correlate with Clinical Variables in African and European American Men with Localized, Therapy Naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'Immune mechanisms behind prostate cancer in men of African ancestry: A review.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.', 'Autoantibody profiles and clinical association in Thai patients with autoimmune retinopathy.']"""

Our goal was to investigate types of increased prostate cancer risk and implications for targeted screening.  Methods:   We investigated computer simulation of subgroups with average and hypothetical increased risk(s) of onset of latent disease, progression, and/or cancer-specific death. For each subgroup, we predicted lifetime probabilities of overdiagnosis and life saved under more and less intensive PSA screening strategies. An application estimated risks of onset among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls (IMPACT) study using maximum likelihood.  Results:   Our simulations implied PSA screening can save more lives among subgroups with increased risk than with average risk, but more intensive screening did not always improve harm-benefit trade-offs. IMPACT data were consistent with increased risks of onset among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers [HR = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-1.59 and HR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14-2.78, respectively]. Our analysis suggests screening BRCA2 mutation carriers earlier and more frequently than the average-risk population, but a lower PSA threshold for biopsy is unlikely to improve outcomes.  Conclusions:   Effective screening in men with increased prostate cancer risk depends on the manner in which the risk is increased. More intensive screening is not always optimal.  Impact:   Guidelines for screening men at increased prostate cancer risk should consider the mechanism inducing the increased risk. Although the benefit of screening may be greater in men with increased risks, more intensive screening is not always appropriate.

We determined the feasibility of prostate imaging with TPUS and subsequently compared prostate localization with TPUS and computed tomography (CT).  Methods and materials:   We completed 2 sequential evaluations of TPUS. The feasibility study included 15 men with localized prostate cancer and tested if TPUS adequately imaged the prostate. Image qualities of the prostate and adjacent normal structures were measured. The subsequent study included 17 men who at the time of initial radiation treatment planning and in 3 subsequent sessions had CT and TPUS imaging performed and compared.  Results:   Feasibility of TPUS was confirmed in the first trial. After expected hardware and software modifications were completed, TPUS provided near complete edge definition of the prostate in the final 5 patients in the feasibility trial. The second study allowed for the comparison of 30 image sets. The differences between TPUS and CT in each direction (mean + standard deviation) were found to be 0.06 ± 2.86 mm (anteroposterior), 0.49 ± 3.49 mm (superoinferior), and 0.63 ± 3.27 mm (left-right), with no significant difference between the 2 modalities (all P > .32). The Euclidean distance variance using the 2 techniques was 5.25 ± 1.79 mm, which was significantly different.  Conclusions:   TPUS provides good imaging of the prostate gland. We noted excellent correlation in gland localization when TPUS is compared with CT scans when comparing routine 3-dimensional positional data. Euclidean distance variation suggests the potential that summation of small errors may in fact lead to significant differences in actual gland positional certainty.

Materials and methods:   From October 2001 to May 2014, 1916 patients underwent brachytherapy and had a pretreatment serum testosterone. Baseline serum testosterone values were collected prospectively before initiation of therapy. Median follow-up was 7.2 years. In total, 26% of the patients received ADT, primarily men with higher risk disease. OM and prostate cancer-specific mortality were examined to determine whether men with lower baseline serum testosterone were at increased risk of mortality when ADT was used, compared with men with baseline normal or higher testosterone.  Results:   Prostate cancer-specific mortality and OM at 10 years was 0.8% and 22.0%. Age, tobacco use, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and percent positive biopsies were the strongest predictors of OM.

Since 1980, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and other diagnostic approaches have been used for PC screening; however, some of these approaches are often deemed painful and cause invasive damage of tissue. Therefore, molecular approaches to PC diagnosis are attracting increasing attention, potentially providing patients with less stressful situations and providing better diagnoses and even prognostic information. Recent metabolomic and genomic studies have suggested that biomolecules can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers or as targets for the development of novel therapeutic modalities. One of these molecules is glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT), an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biochemical conversion of glycine to sarcosine. The link between this molecule (encoded by homonymous gene - GNMT) and PC has been confirmed at several levels, and thus GNMT can be considered a promising target for the development of advanced diagnostic and/or prognostic approaches.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to analyse the physiological role of GNMT and to examine in greater detail its connection with PC at different levels, including gene structure, gene expression, and metabolism, in which GNMT plays an important role, not only in controlling the methylation status of cells, but also the metabolism of folic acid and methionine. Last but not least, we discuss the importance of cellular methylation processes and the link between their aberrations and PC development.Key words: glycine - folic acid - metabolism - methylation - sarcosineThis work was supported by GA CR 16-18917S, League against Cancer Prague (project 2022015) and Czech Ministry of Health - RVO, UH Motol 00064203.The authors declare they have no potential confl icts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical papers.Submitted: 9. 2. 2016Accepted: 20. 3. 2016.""","""['Z Heger', 'T Eckschlager', 'M Stiborová', 'V Adam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['The important role of glycine N-methyltransferase in the carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Methyltetrahydrofolate in folate-binding protein glycine N-methyltransferase.', 'Human liver methionine cycle: MAT1A and GNMT gene resequencing, functional genomics, and hepatic genotype-phenotype correlation.', 'Tumor suppressor gene glycine N-methyltransferase and its potential in liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Glycine and aging: Evidence and mechanisms.']"""

Previously, we showed that FMN-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (FLUSPIO) nanoparticles are suitable for labeling metabolically active cancer and endothelial cells in vitro. In this study, we focused on the in vivo application of FLUSPIO using prostate cancer xenografts. Size, charge, and chemical composition of FLUSPIO were evaluated. We explored the in vitro specificity of FLUSPIO for its cellular receptors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Prussian blue staining. Competitive binding experiments were performed in vivo by injecting free FMN in excess. Bio-distribution of FLUSPIO was determined by estimating iron content in organs and tumors using a colorimetric assay. AFM analysis and zeta potential measurements revealed a particulate morphology approximately 20-40 nm in size and a negative zeta potential (-24.23 ± 0.15 mV) in water. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry data confirmed FMN present on the USPIO nanoparticle surface. FLUSPIO uptake in prostate cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was significantly higher than that of control USPIO, while addition of excess of free FMN reduced accumulation. Similarly, in vivo MRI and histology showed specific FLUSPIO uptake by prostate cancer cells, tumor endothelial cells, and tumor-associated macrophages. Besides prominent tumor accumulation, FLUSPIO accumulated in the liver, spleen, lung, and skin. Hence, our data strengthen our hypothesis that targeting riboflavin receptors is an efficient approach to accumulate nanomedicines in tumors opening perspectives for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

Objective:   To use an informatics approach to examine the association of ADT as a treatment for prostate cancer with the subsequent development of dementia (eg, senile dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer dementia).  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cohort study, a text-processing method was used to analyze electronic medical record data from an academic medical center from 1994 to 2013, with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 1.0-7.2 years). We identified 9455 individuals with prostate cancer who were 18 years or older at diagnosis with data recorded in the electronic health record and follow-up after diagnosis. We excluded 183 patients with a previous diagnosis of dementia. Our final cohort comprised 9272 individuals with prostate cancer, including 1826 men (19.7%) who received ADT.  Main outcomes and measures:   We tested the effect of ADT on the risk of dementia using propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  Results:   Among 9272 men with prostate cancer (mean [SD] age, 66.9 [10.9] years; 5450 [58.8%] white), there was a statistically significant association between use of ADT and risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.58-2.99; P < .001). In sensitivity analyses, results were similar when excluding patients with Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.73-3.12; P < .001). The absolute increased risk of developing dementia among those who received ADT was 4.4% at 5 years (7.9% among those who received ADT vs 3.5% in those who did not receive ADT). Analyses stratified by duration of ADT found that individuals with at least 12 months of ADT use had the greatest absolute increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.64-3.38; P < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that ADT users 70 years or older had the lowest cumulative probability of remaining dementia free (log-rank P < .001).

Some clinical studies have shown an increase in neuroendocrine-like cells parallel to the tumor progression but their exact role is a matter of debate. The prostate is a well-known target for melatonin, which reduces PCa cells proliferation and induces neuroendocrine differentiation. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the indole effects on neuroendocrine differentiation and its impact on PCa progression, we used a cell culture model (LNCaP) and a murine model (TRAMP). Persistent ERK1/2 activation was found in both, melatonin and androgen-deprived cells. Melatonin blocked nuclear translocation of androgen receptor (AR), thus confirming anti-androgenic actions of the indole. However, using a comparative genome microarray to check the differentially expressed genes in control, melatonin, or androgen-deprived cells, some differences were found, suggesting a more complex role of the indole. By comparing control cells with those treated with melatonin or depleted of androgen, a cluster of 26 differentially expressed genes (±2.5-fold) was found. Kallikreins (KLK)2 and KLK3 (PSA) were dramatically downregulated by both treatments whereas IGFBP3 and IGF1R were up- and downregulated, respectively, in both experimental groups, thus showing a role for IGF in both scenarios. Finally, melatonin prolonged the survival of TRAMP mice by 33% when given at the beginning or at advances stages of the tumor. Serum IGFBP3 was significantly elevated by the indole in early stages of the tumor, confirming in vivo the role of the IGF signaling in the oncostatic action of the indole.""","""['Juan C Mayo', 'David Hevia', 'Isabel Quiros-Gonzalez', 'Aida Rodriguez-Garcia', 'Pedro Gonzalez-Menendez', 'Vanesa Cepas', 'Iván Gonzalez-Pola', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['The insulin-like growth factor axis and prostate cancer: lessons from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.', 'Melatonin, a novel Sirt1 inhibitor, imparts antiproliferative effects against prostate cancer in vitro in culture and in vivo in TRAMP model.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Prostate cancer chemoprevention by silibinin: bench to bedside.', 'Modulatory actions of neuropeptide Y on prostate cancer growth: role of MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 activation.', 'Selected Parameters of Bone Turnover in Neuroendocrine Tumors-A Potential Clinical Use?', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'IGFBP3 Enhances Treatment Outcome and Predicts Favorable Prognosis in ABC-DLBCL.', 'Interactions of melatonin with various signaling pathways: implications for cancer therapy.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.']"""

For this, we propose three important features: the average expression of a miRNA in multiple cancer samples, the average of the absolute correlation values between the expression of a miRNA and expression of all genes, and the number of predicted miRNA target genes. These three features were integrated using order statistics. By applying the proposed approach to four cancer types, glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, we prioritized candidate cancer-related miRNAs and determined their functional roles in cancer-related pathways.

For analyses of circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, participants with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer (n = 79) were compared with control participants (n = 87).  Results:   Cytokine analyses showed a T helper 2 response with suppressed T helper 1 response in prostate cancer patients, as evidenced by significantly increased levels of interleukin-13 and reduced levels of interleukin-12p70. Herpesvirus 8 seropositive men showed significantly increased levels of interleukin-13 and interleukin-10. At logistic regression analyses, interleukin-12p70 predicted prostate cancer in 94.4% of human herpesvirus 8 seropositive men.

Materials and methods:   176 patients enrolled in this study had abnormal prostate specific antigen (PSA) or digital rectal examination and were candidates for prostate needle biopsy. Blood samples were obtained from each patient prior to biopsy and the samples were frozen for EPCA-2 measurement. Patients diagnosed with cancer were assigned to the case group and those with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were included in the control group. Univariate and multivariable analyses were done to assess the relationship between different independent variables with cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic power of EPCA-2 for cancer was estimated at different levels of PSA according to the ROC curve.  Results:   The mean(&plusmn; SD) age of cancer cases was 70.33(&plusmn; 9.02) years while it was 63.34(&plusmn; 9.47) years for BPH cases (P &lt; .01). EPCA-2 and PSA were also significantly different between cancer and BPH cases (P &lt; .001). The multivariable logistic regression showed that EPCA-2 has a significant relationship with cancer diagnosis (OR=1.009, P = .021). After controlling other variables following stratification for PSA, it was shown that EPCA-2 and cancer were correlated just when PSA was &gt;10 (P &lt; .001).

Methods:   Data were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,370 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Over the study period, 602 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between midlife sleep duration, sleep quality, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were employed to account for potential familial confounding.  Results:   Compared to ""definite morning"" types, ""somewhat evening"" types had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.3; 95 % CI 1.1, 1.6). Chronotype significantly modified the relationship between shift work and prostate cancer risk (p-interaction <0.001). We found no significant association between sleep duration, sleep quality, or shift work and prostate cancer risk in the overall analyses and no significant association between any sleep- or circadian-related parameter and risk in co-twin analyses. Neither sleep- nor circadian-related parameters were significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Conclusion:   The association between sleep disruption, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and mortality has never before been studied in a prospective study of male twins. Our findings suggest that chronotype may be associated with prostate cancer risk and modify the association between shift work and prostate cancer risk.

Methods:   We relied on the SEER-Medicare database for non-organ-confined, muscle-invasive T2 N+ -T4a UCUB patients who underwent RC between 1991 and 2009 without neoadjuvant chemotherapy delivery. Multivariable logistic regression analyses tested predictors of AC use; T-stage, N-stage, year of diagnosis, age, gender, race, radiotherapy (RT) administration, marital urban and socioeconomic status, tumor grade and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).  Results:   Overall, 2681 patients were identified. Of those, 667 (24.9%) received AC.

AMPK functions as a fuel gauge monitoring systemic and cellular energy status. Activation of AMPK occurs when the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio increases and leads to a metabolic switch from anabolism to catabolism. AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the first and rate-limiting reaction in de novo synthesis of fatty acids. AMPK thus regulates homeostasis of acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite at the crossroads of metabolism, signaling, chromatin structure, and transcription. Nucleocytosolic concentration of acetyl-CoA affects histone acetylation and links metabolism and chromatin structure. Here we show that activation of AMPK with the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin or with the AMP mimetic 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide increases the inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC and decreases the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, leading to increased protein acetylation and altered gene expression in prostate and ovarian cancer cells. Direct inhibition of ACC with allosteric inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid also increases acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. Because AMPK activation requires liver kinase B1, metformin does not induce protein acetylation in liver kinase B1-deficient cells. Together, our data indicate that AMPK regulates the availability of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA for protein acetylation and that AMPK activators, such as metformin, have the capacity to increase protein acetylation and alter patterns of gene expression, further expanding the plethora of metformin's physiological effects.""","""['Luciano Galdieri', 'Himavanth Gatla', 'Ivana Vancurova', 'Ales Vancura']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 regulates acetyl coenzyme A homeostasis and histone acetylation.', 'Reciprocal Regulation of AMPK/SNF1 and Protein Acetylation.', 'Salicylate activates AMPK and synergizes with metformin to reduce the survival of prostate and lung cancer cells ex vivo through inhibition of de novo lipogenesis.', 'Enhanced muscle fat oxidation and glucose transport by ACRP30 globular domain: acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibition and AMP-activated protein kinase activation.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase regulation of fatty acid oxidation in the ischaemic heart.', 'Tumor metabolism rewiring in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Acetylcarnitine shuttling links mitochondrial metabolism to histone acetylation and lipogenesis.', 'Tubulin Post-Translational Modifications: The Elusive Roles of Acetylation.', 'The sirtuin family in health and disease.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.']"""

Due to limitations of the methods available for AR-V7 analysis, the identification of a reliable detection method may facilitate the use of this biomarker in clinical practice.  Objective:   To confirm AR-V7 as a predictor of resistance to hormonal therapy and develop a new approach to assess AR-V7 by highly sensitive digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in plasma-derived exosomal RNA.  Design, setting, and participants:   Plasma samples were collected from 36 CRPC patients before they began second-line hormonal treatment. Exosomes were isolated and RNA extracted for analysis of AR-V7 by ddPCR.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The absolute target gene concentration as copies per milliliter (copies/ml) was determined by ddPCR. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).  Results and limitations:   A total of 26 patients received abiraterone and 10 enzalutamide; 39% of patients were found to be AR-V7 positive (AR-V7+). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in AR-V7 negative (AR-V7-) versus AR-V7+ patients (20 vs 3 mo; p<0.001). Overall survival was significantly shorter in AR-V7+ participants at baseline compared with AR-V7- participants (8 mo vs not reached; p<0.001).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that plasma-derived exosomal RNA is a reliable source of AR-V7 that can be detected sensitively by ddPCR assay. We also showed that resistance to hormonal therapy may be predicted by AR-V7, making it a clinically relevant biomarker.  Patient summary:   We report a first study on a method for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detection in RNA extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood.

We assessed the activity and safety of nivolumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy.  Methods:   In this phase 1/2, multicentre, open-label study, we enrolled patients (age ≥18 years) with urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra at 16 sites in Finland, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Patients were not selected by PD-L1 expression, but tumour PD-L1 membrane expression was assessed retrospectively. Patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or treatment discontinuation because of unacceptable toxicity or other protocol-defined reasons, whichever occurred later. The primary endpoint was objective response by investigator assessment. All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the analyses. We report an interim analysis of this ongoing trial. CheckMate 032 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01928394.  Findings:   Between June 5, 2014, and April 24, 2015, 86 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma were enrolled in the nivolumab monotherapy group and 78 received at least one dose of treatment. At data cutoff (March 24, 2016), the minimum follow-up was 9 months (median 15·2 months, IQR 12·9-16·8). A confirmed investigator-assessed objective response was achieved in 19 (24·4%, 95% CI 15·3-35·4) of 78 patients. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (22%) of 78 patients; the most common were elevated lipase (four [5%]), elevated amylase (three [4%]), and fatigue, maculopapular rash, dyspnoea, decreased lymphocyte count, and decreased neutrophil count (two [3%] each). Serious adverse events were reported in 36 (46%) of 78 patients and eight (10%) had a serious adverse event judged to be treatment related. Two (3%) of 78 patients discontinued because of treatment-related adverse events (grade 4 pneumonitis and grade 4 thrombocytopenia) and subsequently died.  Interpretation:   Nivolumab monotherapy was associated with a substantial and durable clinical response and a manageable safety profile in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. These data support further investigation of nivolumab monotherapy in advanced urothelial carcinoma.

We investigated the association between polymorphism of the Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and risk of NPC in North Africa. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that acts as both a tumor suppressor and a stimulator of cancer development; it has been shown to influence risk of numerous other carcinomas including lung, breast and prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   From April 2005 to December 2015, a total of 1154 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent PVP. The type of Green Light laser was an 80 W potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser and later a 120 W lithium triborate laser. Before and after surgery, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), post-voiding volume of residual urine (PVR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and prostate volume were assessed regularly. After surgery, events such as second PVP, transurethral incision, and permanent urethral catheterization were defined as retreatment.  Results:   The mean and median periods of follow-up after PVP were 35.4 and 24.0 months, respectively. The maximum duration of follow-up was 125 months. Compared with before surgery, the IPSS, quality of life score, and PSA concentration improved significantly, even at 10 years after PVP; however, Qmax and PVR were not improved at 10 years. The retreatment-free survival rate was 93.9% at 5 years and 79.0% at 10 years. Prostate cancer was found in 27 cases after PVP, and all patients who were found to have prostate cancer remained alive.

However, the expression level and the role of miR-1297 in prostate cancer remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the potential role and molecular mechanism of miR-1297 in prostate cancer progression. We found that miR-1297 was significantly downregulated in human prostate cancer specimens as well as in several prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression of miR-1297 remarkably inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion whereas miR-1297 suppression significantly promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), a well-known oncogene, is a predicted target of miR-1297. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-1297 was able to directly target the 3'-untranslated region of AEG-1. In addition, RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that miR-1297 regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of AEG-1. We also showed that miR-1297 was able to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that AEG-1 contributed to miR-1297-endowed effects on cell proliferation and invasion as well as Wnt signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-1297 inhibits prostate cancer proliferation and invasion by targeting AEG-1, thereby providing novel insight into understanding the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

As Jmjd2a is a histone demethylase, in the current study, we investigated the relationship between interaction Lgr4 with Jmjd 2a and Jmjd2a/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway in PCa progression. Firstly, Lgr4 was overexpressed by transfecting pcDNA3.1(+)/Lgr4 plasmids into PCa (LNCaP and PC-3) cell lines. Next, we found that Lgr4 overexpression promoted Jmjd2a mRNA expression, reduced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in the S phase, these effects were reversed by Jmjd2a silencing. Moreover, Lgr4 overexpression markedly elevated AR levels and its interaction with Jmjd2a, which was tested by co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, interaction AR with PSA promoter (containing an AR response element) was obviously improved by Lgr4 overexpression, and PSA silencing reduced Lgr4-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PCa cells. Taken together, Lgr4 may be a novel tumor marker providing new mechanistic insights into PCa progression.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that serves as a survival mechanism to relieve ER stress and restore ER homeostasis. However, when persistent, ER stress can alter the cytoprotective functions of the UPR to promote autophagy and cell death. Although MSKE has been documented to induce apoptosis, it has not been linked to ER stress/UPR/autophagy. We hypothesized that MSKE may induce a severe ER stress response-mediated autophagy leading to apoptosis. As a model, we treated C4-2 prostate cancer cells with MSKE and performed a quantitative Tandem Mass Tag Isobaric Labeling proteomic analysis. ER stress response, autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed by western blot, acridine orange and TUNEL/Annexin V staining, respectively. Quantitative proteomics analysis indicated that ER stress response proteins, such as GRP78 were greatly elevated following treatment with MSKE. The up-regulation of pro-apoptotic markers PARP, caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, -7, BAX and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic marker BCL2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis and apoptosis was visualized by increased TUNEL/Annexin V staining upon MSKE treatment. Moreover, increased acridine orange, and LC3B staining was detected in MSKE-treated cells, suggesting an ER stress/autophagy response. Finally, MSKE-mediated autophagy and apoptosis was antagonized by co-treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor.

Methods:   Twenty patients with PCa were administered intravenously with the 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA ligand (mean activity 99 MBq/patient, range 76-148 MBq) and subsequently underwent PET/MRI at, on average, 168 min (range 77-320 min) after injection. PET and MR imaging data were acquired simultaneously. PET acquisition was performed in list mode and PET images were reconstructed at different time intervals (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min). Data were analyzed regarding radiotracer uptake in tumors and muscle tissue and PET image quality. Tumor uptake was quantified in terms of the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean) within a spherical volume of interest (VOI). Reference VOIs were drawn in the gluteus maximus muscle on the right side. PET image quality was evaluated by experienced nuclear physicians/radiologists using a five-point ordinal scale from 5-1 (excellent-insufficient).  Results:   Lesion detectability linearly increased with increasing acquisition times, reaching its maximum at PET acquisition times of 4 min. At this image acquisition time, tumor lesions in 19/20 (95%) patients were detected. PET image quality showed a positive correlation with increasing acquisition time, reaching a plateau at 4-6 min image acquisition. Both SUVmax and SUVmean correlated inversely with acquisition time and reached a plateau at acquisition times after 4 min.  Conclusion:   In the applied image acquisition settings, the optimal acquisition time of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/MRI in patients with local and metastatic PCa was identified to be 4 min per bed position.

Here we show that transgenic mice expressing the mitochondrial chaperone TNFR-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) in the prostate develop epithelial hyperplasia and cellular atypia. When examined on a Pten+/- background, a common alteration in human prostate cancer, TRAP1 transgenic mice showed accelerated incidence of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma, characterized by increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in situ Conversely, homozygous deletion of TRAP1 delays prostatic tumorigenesis in Pten+/- mice without affecting hyperplasia or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

Highly proliferative malignant cells require sufficient levels of nutrients for their anabolic activity. Therefore, targeting genes and pathways involved in metabolic pathways could yield future therapeutics. A common pathway implicated in energetic and nutritional requirements of a cell is the LKB1/AMPK pathway. Metformin is a widely studied anti-diabetic drug, which improves glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes by targeting this pathway. We investigated the effect of metformin on prostate cancer cell lines and evaluated its mechanism of action using DU145, LNCaP, PC3 and VCaP prostate cancer cell lines. Trypan blue dye-exclusion assay was used to assess levels of cell death. Western immunoblotting was used to determine the abundance of proteins. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) and AMPK genes were silenced using siRNA. Effects on cell morphology were visualised using microscopy. IGFBP-2 gene expression was assessed using real-time RT-PCR. With DU145 and LNCaP cells metformin alone induced cell death, but this was reduced in hyperglycaemic conditions. Hyperglycaemia also reduced the sensitivity to Docetaxel, but this was countered by co-treatment with metformin. LKB1 was required for the activation of AMPK but was not essential to mediate the induction of cell death. An alternative pathway by which metformin exerted its action was through downregulation of IGFBP-2 in DU145 and LNCaP cells, independently of AMPK. This finding could have important implications in relation to therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer patients presenting with diabetes.""","""['K M Biernacka', 'R A Persad', 'A Bahl', 'D Gillatt', 'J M P Holly', 'C M Perks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Hyperglycaemia-induced chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells due to IGFBP2.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 promotes prostate cancer cell growth via IGF-dependent or -independent mechanisms and reduces the efficacy of docetaxel.', 'Metformin enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity by suppressing signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 activity independently of the liver kinase B1-AMP-activated protein kinase pathway.', 'Metformin and cancer.', 'Mitochondrial targets of metformin-Are they physiologically relevant?', 'A role for androgen receptor variant 7 in sensitivity to therapy: Involvement of IGFBP-2 and FOXA1.', 'Metformin alters therapeutic effects in the BALB/c tumor therapy model.', 'Current Status and Application of Metformin for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin, reduces cytotoxicity caused by irradiation in a diabetic environment through the induction of endogenous antioxidant defenses.', 'Effects of hyperglycemia on the progression of tumor diseases.']"""

However, the mechanism underlying urinary excretion is unknown. In this study, we investigated the involvement of AATs and drug transporters in renal [18F]fluciclovine reuptake. [14C]Fluciclovine (trans-1-amino-3-fluoro[1-14C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid) was used because of its long half-life. The involvement of AATs in [14C]fluciclovine transport was measured by apical-to-basal transport using an LLC-PK1 monolayer as model for renal proximal tubules. The contribution of drug transporters herein was assessed using vesicles/cells expressing the drug transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4), organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) , organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3). The apical-to-basal transport of [14C]fluciclovine was attenuated by l-threonine, the substrate for system alanine-serine-cysteine (ASC) AATs. [14C]Fluciclovine uptake by drug transporter-expressing vesicles/cells was not significantly different from that of control vesicles/cells. Fluciclovine inhibited P-gp, MRP4, OAT1, OCT2, and OATP1B1 (IC50 > 2.95 mM). Therefore, system ASC AATs may be partly involved in the renal reuptake of [18F]fluciclovine. Further, given that [18F]fluciclovine is recognized as an inhibitor with millimolar affinity for the tested drug transporters, slow urinary excretion of [18F]fluciclovine may be mediated by system ASC AATs, but not by drug transporters.""","""['Masahiro Ono', 'Atsumi Baden', 'Hiroyuki Okudaira', 'Masato Kobayashi', 'Keiichi Kawai', 'Shuntaro Oka', 'Hirokatsu Yoshimura']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Multiple human isoforms of drug transporters contribute to the hepatic and renal transport of olmesartan, a selective antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1-receptor.', 'Organic anion transporter 3- and organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1- and 1B3-mediated transport of catalposide.', '(14)CFluciclovine (alias anti-(14)CFACBC) uptake and ASCT2 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Renal Drug Transporters and Drug Interactions.', 'Transporter-mediated Natural Product-Drug Interactions.', 'New fluoroethyl phenylalanine analogues as potential LAT1-targeting PET tracers for glioblastoma.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients with SVI during RP and pelvic lymph node dissection at two major referral centres from 1986 to 2014 were included. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regressions were used to determine if adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT) were predictors of biochemical recurrence (BCR), cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM). Subset analyses were performed for pN0 patients and pN+ patients.  Results:   Overall, 3 279 patients with prostate cancer and SVI were included with a median follow-up of 148 months. Considering the whole SVI population, 1 387 (42%) received no adjuvant therapy, 1 179 (36%) received aHT, 461 (14.1%) received aRT, while 252 (7.7%) received both aHT and aRT.

When only pT3bN0 patients were considered, aHT was a significant multivariate predictor of BCR [hazard ratio (HR) 0.50, P < 0.001), CSM (HR 0.62, P = 0.01) and OM (HR 0.75, P = 0.004). Conversely, aRT was not associated with survival outcomes (all P > 0.05). When only the subgroup pT3bN+ was considered, the use of aRT was related to an improvement in CSM (HR 0.65, P = 0.03) and OM (HR 0.78, P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   aHT + aRT seems to be effective in pT3b patients.

Patients and methods:   Men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer participating in an ongoing randomised, multicentre UK trial comparing tE2 versus LHRHa for ADT were enrolled into a QoL sub-study. tE2 was delivered via three or four transcutaneous patches containing oestradiol 100 μg/24 h. LHRHa was administered as per local practice. Patients completed questionnaires based on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 30-item core (EORTC QLQ-C30) with prostate-specific module QLQ PR25. The primary outcome measure was global QoL score at 6 months, compared between randomised arms.  Results:   In all, 727 men were enrolled between August 2007 and October 2015 (412 tE2, 315 LHRHa) with QoL questionnaires completed at both baseline and 6 months. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between arms: median (interquartile range) age of 74 (68-79) years and PSA level of 44 (19-119) ng/mL, and 40% (294/727) had metastatic disease. At 6 months, patients on tE2 reported higher global QoL than those on LHRHa (mean difference +4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.1; P = 0.006), less fatigue, and improved physical function. Men in the tE2 arm were less likely to experience hot flushes (8% vs 46%), and report a lack of sexual interest (59% vs 74%) and sexual activity, but had higher rates of significant gynaecomastia (37% vs 5%). The higher incidence of hot flushes among LHRHa patients appear to account for both the reduced global QoL and increased fatigue in the LHRHa arm compared to the tE2 arm.  Conclusion:   Patients receiving tE2 for ADT had better 6-month self-reported QoL outcomes compared to those on LHRHa, but increased likelihood of gynaecomastia.

We previously found a role of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK in PCa dormancy regulation. However, the mechanism and contributions of the individual TAM receptors is largely unknown. Knockdown of MERTK, but not AXL or TYRO3 by shRNA in PCa cells induced a decreased ratio of P-Erk1/2 to P-p38, increased expression of p27, NR2F1, SOX2, and NANOG, induced higher levels of histone H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and induced a G1/G0 arrest, all of which are associated with dormancy. Similar effects were also observed with siRNA. Most importantly, knockdown of MERTK in PCa cells increased metastasis free survival in an intra-cardiac injection mouse xenograft model. MERTK knockdown also failed to inhibit PCa growth in vitro and subcutaneous growth in vivo, which suggests that MERTK has specificity for dormancy regulation or requires a signal from the PCa microenvironment. The effects of MERTK on the cell cycle and histone methylation were reversed by p38 inhibitor SB203580, which indicates the importance of MAP kinases for MERTK dormancy regulation. Overall, this study shows that MERTK stimulates PCa dormancy escape through a MAP kinase dependent mechanism, also involving p27, pluripotency transcription factors, and histone methylation. J. Cell.

The fusion of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 and the oncogene ERG (TMPRSS2:ERG or T2E) is common in PCa, and prostate tumors that harbor the gene fusion are believed to represent a distinct disease subtype. We studied the association of CCB use with the risk of PCa, and molecular subtypes of PCa defined by T2E status.  Methods:   Participants were residents of King County, Washington, recruited for population-based case-control studies (1993-1996 or 2002-2005). Tumor T2E status was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using tumor tissue specimens from radical prostatectomy. Detailed information on use of CCBs and other variables was obtained through in-person interviews. Binomial and polytomous logistic regression were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   The study included 1,747 PCa patients and 1,635 age-matched controls. A subset of 563 patients treated with radical prostatectomy had T2E status determined, of which 295 were T2E positive (52%). Use of CCBs (ever vs. never) was not associated with overall PCa risk. However, among European-American men, users had a reduced risk of higher-grade PCa (Gleason scores ≥7: adjusted OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.44-0.95). Further, use of CCBs was associated with a reduced risk of T2E positive PCa (adjusted OR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.78), but was not associated with T2E negative PCa.  Conclusions:   This study found suggestive evidence that use of CCBs is associated with reduced relative risks for higher Gleason score and T2E positive PCa. Future studies of PCa etiology should consider etiologic heterogeneity as PCa subtypes may develop through different causal pathways.

We assessed the predictive ability of the five-tier grade group (GG) system on harder clinical endpoint, namely clinical recurrence (CR).  Methods:   Between 2005 and 2014, 9,728 clinically localized PCa patients were treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) at two tertiary referral centers. Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariable Cox regression analyses, and concordance index (C-index) were used to assess CR after treatment according to four Gleason grade classifications at biopsy and RP: Group 1: ≤6 versus 7 versus ≥8; Group 2: ≤6 versus 3 + 4 vs. 4 + 3 versus ≥8; Group 3: ≤6 versus 7 versus 8 versus ≥9; Group 4: ≤6 versus 3 + 4 versus 4 + 3 versus 8 versus ≥9. Same analyses were repeated in patients who had BCR (n = 1,624). Decision curve analyses were performed to evaluate and compare the net benefit associated with the use of the four Gleason grade classifications.  Results:   Overall, 443 (4.6%) patients had CR. The hazard ratio of the GS 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and ≥9 relative to GS ≤6 were 3.63, 5.93, 11.44, 18.08 and 4.93, 9.99, 15.31 and 25.12 in the pre- and post-treatment models, respectively. The C-index of the five-tier GG system was slightly higher relative to the other 3 Gleason grade classifications both in the pre- (range: 0.001-0.006) and post-treatment models (range: 0-0.008). Similar findings were observed when we focused our analyses in patients with BCR after RP. The use of the five-tier GG system did not result into higher net-benefit relative to the other three Gleason grade classifications.  Conclusions:   The difference in accuracy between the five-tier GG system and the other Gleason grade classifications, using CR as an endpoint, is clinically negligible. Current evidence suggests that the five-tier GG system represents a simplified user-friendly scheme available for patient counseling rather than a new histopathological diagnostic system that improves the prediction of CR.

However, previous studies with plasma DNA from patients with cancer demonstrated highly variable allele frequencies of ctDNA. Comprehensive genome-wide analysis of tumor genomes is greatly facilitated when plasma DNA has increased amounts of ctDNA. In order to develop a fast and cost-effective pre-screening method for the identification of plasma samples suitable for further extensive qualitative analysis, we adapted the recently described FAST-SeqS method.

Moreover, since the genome-wide mFAST-SeqS z-scores correlate with the actual tumor content in plasma samples, changes in ctDNA levels associated with response to treatment can be easily monitored without prior knowledge of the genetic composition of tumor samples.""","""['Jelena Belic', 'Marina Koch', 'Peter Ulz', 'Martina Auer', 'Teresa Gerhalter', 'Sumitra Mohan', 'Katja Fischereder', 'Edgar Petru', 'Thomas Bauernhofer', 'Jochen B Geigl', 'Michael R Speicher', 'Ellen Heitzer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Rapid Identification of Plasma DNA Samples with Increased ctDNA Levels by a Modified FAST-SeqS Approach.', 'Genome-wide aneuploidy detected by mFast-SeqS in circulating cell-free DNA is associated with poor response to pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial cancer.', 'Untargeted Assessment of Tumor Fractions in Plasma for Monitoring and Prognostication from Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Systemic Treatment.', 'Cell-free circulating tumour DNA as a liquid biopsy in breast cancer.', 'Use of cell free DNA in breast oncology.', 'Tumor-agnostic ctDNA levels by mFAST-SeqS in first-line HR-positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients as a biomarker for survival.', 'Sequence-Based Platforms for Discovering Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of liquid biopsy in the era of precision medicine: 10 years of clinical evidence in cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA in Pediatric Cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Solid Tumors: Current Horizons and Future Perspectives.']"""

Methods:   Seven hundred and seventy-one patients who underwent TURP from May 2004 to September 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. In our institution, TURP specimens should be totally submitted in an extensive sampling method. The tumor area was outlined by estimation of an experienced genitourinary pathologist and calculated by the image analysis system software (Image J 1.47 h). The tumor area was then multiplied by the thickness of tissue. The total sum of all tumor volume was the estimated tumor volume. The clinical and pathological factors, follow-up results were obtained and we aimed to collect information about the period of watchful waiting (WW), PSA progression status, intervention status during the follow-up, the reason for intervention on WW and the type of intervention.  Results:   The average age of 771 patients was (71.3±5.9) years old, and the average BMI was (23.9±3.1) kg/m2, preoperative average tPSA was (4.4±2.8) μg/L. Eighty-six (11.2%) cases of incidental prostate cancer were detected. The patients in T1a group (77 cases, 89.5%) had tumor volumes of (12.3±12.6) mm3, and the patients in T1b group had tumor volumes of (105.1±41.8) mm3.The range of tumor volume was 0.4-180.2 mm3. The volume of all the 86 cases was less than 500 mm3 as the threshold of insignificant cancer. All the patients were managed by WW. The mean follow-up time was 88.9 (27.9-150.1) months.The Gleason score was <7 in 79 patients, and ≥7 in 7 patients. There was no significant difference in age, preoperative tPSA, preoperative PSAD, postoperative tPSA, prostate volume and TURP resection between T1a group and T1b group (P>0.05). Among 84 patients without follow-up losts, PSA progression occurred in 5 patients. One T1a patient underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) as an intervention, and 3 patients underwent hormone therapy. One patient in T1b group underwent radiotherapy for PSA progression and one was treated because of patient preference without evidence of disease progression. There were no patients who died due to prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Eighty-six (11.2%) cases of incidental prostate cancer were detected.

The mean levels and proportions of GS, primary and secondary grades were studied. The patients were divided into four groups according to age: <60, 60-69, 70-79 and ≥80 years. Types of specimen included needle biopsy (NB), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and radical prostatectomy (RP). Histological types were made up by acinar carcinoma and other types (including atrophic, pseudohyperplastic, foam, signet ring cell and ductal carcinoma, and so on). The total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) involved groups of <20.0 μg/L and ≥20.0 μg/L. We observed the mean levels and proportions of GS in age, types of specimen, histological types and total prostate-specific antigen in different periods, and used SPSS 17.0 software for statistical analysis.  Results:   Compared with 1995-2004, the mean levels of GS, primary and secondary grades decreased 0.32 (P=0.003), 0.19 (P=0.001) and 0.12 (P=0.016) in 2005-2014, respectively.

We found that one of the responses of in vitro and in vivo cancer cells to photodynamic therapy was a massive production and emission of extracellular vesicles (EVs): only 1 hour after the photo-activation, thousands of vesicles per cell were emitted in the extracellular medium. A similar effect has been found after treatment with Doxorubicin (chemotherapy), but far less EVs were produced, even 24 hours after the treatment.

Using a microarray platform containing probes for 851 human miRNAs we found 26 deregulated miRNAs in high-grade bladder cancer urine EVs, from which 23 were downregulated and 3 upregulated. Real-time PCR analysis pointed to miR-375 as a biomarker for high-grade bladder cancer while miR-146a could identify low-grade patients.

Objective:   To describe our surgical technique using a urinary bladder extracellular matrix (UB-ECM) scaffold incorporated into the base of the VUA and the distal bladder neck during salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP) and to assess outcomes and safety.  Design, setting, and participants:   From March to July 2015, 15 patients underwent sRARP performed after primary therapy failure by a single surgeon. Two other groups were identified via analysis of propensity score matching. Group 2 (n=45) underwent sRARP with standard suturing without use of the graft. Group 3 (control group; n=45) underwent primary RARP with no graft placement. These two groups were compared group 1 (n=15), in which patients underwent sRARP and received the scaffold in a 1:3:3 match.  Surgical procedure:   sRARP with use of a UB-ECM scaffold in the posterior aspect of the VUA and distal bladder neck.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Clinical data were prospectively collected in a customized database and retrospectively analyzed. Analysis of variance and Student's t-test were used to test the equality of means for continuous variables, while the χ2 test was used to test categorical variables.  Results and limitations:   There were no anastomotic leaks in the control group, with an average catheter time of 6.3 d (5-7 d). However, a clinically significant VUA/bladder neck disruption was observed in 16 patients (35.5%) in group 2, with a median catheterization time of 17.4 d (9-47 d), while in group 1 only one patient (6.66%) had a significant anastomotic leak on cystography (p=0.045), with median catheterization time of 11.2 d (10-52 d) for this group (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Incorporation of a UB-ECM scaffold into the base of the VUA and distal bladder neck should be considered as an option to decrease morbidity associated with sRARP since it decreased the rate of VUA disruption, enhanced healing, and reduced catheterization time. This technique could be a valuable tool for all surgeons performing sRARP.

Sema3E-receptor, PlexinD1, is frequently upregulated in melanoma, breast, colon, ovarian and prostate cancers; however, the mechanisms underlying PlexinD1 upregulation and the downstream events elicited in tumor cells are still unclear. Here we show that the canonical RBPjk-dependent Notch signaling cascade controls PlexinD1 expression in primary endothelial and cancer cells. Transcriptional activation was studied by quantitative PCR and promoter activity reporter assays. We found that Notch ligands and constitutively activated intracellular forms of Notch receptors upregulated PlexinD1 expression; conversely RNAi-based knock-down, or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling by gamma-secretase inhibitors, downregulated PlexinD1 levels. Notably, both Notch1 and Notch3 expression positively correlates with PlexinD1 levels in prostate cancer, as well as in other tumor types. In prostate cancer cells, Sema3E-PlexinD1 axis was previously reported to regulate migration; however, implicated mechanisms were not elucidated. Here we show that in these cells PlexinD1 activity induces the expression of the transcription factor Slug, downregulates E-cadherin levels and enhances cell migration. Moreover, our mechanistic data identify PlexinD1 as a pivotal mediator of this signaling axis downstream of Notch in prostate cancer cells. In fact, on one hand, PlexinD1 is required to mediate cell migration and E-cadherin regulation elicited by Notch. On the other hand, PlexinD1 upregulation is sufficient to induce prostate cancer cell migration and metastatic potential in mice, leading to functional rescue in the absence of Notch. In sum, our work identifies PlexinD1 as a novel transcriptional target induced by Notch signaling, and reveals its role promoting prostate cancer cell migration and downregulating E-cadherin levels in Slug-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings suggest that Notch-PlexinD1 signaling axis may be targeted to impair prostate cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis.""","""['Michael Rehman', 'Sreeharsha Gurrapu', 'Gabriella Cagnoni', 'Lorena Capparuccia', 'Luca Tamagnone']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: PlexinD1 Is a Novel Transcriptional Target and Effector of Notch Signaling in Cancer Cells.', 'Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) is critical for leptin-induced proliferation, migration and VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression in breast cancer.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Notch1 signaling regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of breast cancer in a Slug-dependent manner.', 'Blockade of Jagged/Notch pathway abrogates transforming growth factor β2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human retinal pigment epithelium cells.', 'The molecular basis of notch signaling regulation: a complex simplicity.', 'Low Doses of PFOA Promote Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells Growth through Different Pathways.', 'Trojan horse treatment based on PEG-coated extracellular vesicles to deliver doxorubicin to melanoma in vitro and in vivo.', 'Role of PLEXIND1/TGFβ Signaling Axis in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Progression Correlates with the Mutational Status of KRAS.', 'A Molecular Test for Quantifying Functional Notch Signaling Pathway Activity in Human Cancer.', 'Long-Term Inhibition of Notch in A-375 Melanoma Cells Enhances Tumor Growth Through the Enhancement of AXIN1, CSNK2A3, and CEBPA2 as Intermediate Genes in Wnt and Notch Pathways.']"""

It is critical to identify and characterize oncogenes that drive the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer. The current study builds upon previous research showing that a disintegrin and metallproteinase (ADAM)28 is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. Our novel study used overexpression, pharmacological, and molecular approaches to investigate the biological function of ADAM28 in human prostate cancer cells, with a focus on cell proliferation and migration. The results of this study provide important insights into the role of metalloproteinases in human prostate cancer.The expression of ADAM28 protein levels was assessed within human prostate tumors and normal adjacent tissue by immunohistochemistry. Immunocytochemistry and western blotting were used to assess ADAM28 protein expression in human prostate cancer cell lines. Functional assays were conducted to assess proliferation and migration in human prostate cancer cells in which ADAM28 protein expression or activity had been altered by overexpression, pharmacological inhibition, or by siRNA gene knockdown.The membrane bound ADAM28 was increased in human tumor biopsies and prostate cancer cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM28 activity and/or knockdown of ADAM28 significantly reduced proliferation and migration of human prostate cancer cells, while overexpression of ADAM28 significantly increased proliferation and migration.ADAM28 is overexpressed in primary human prostate tumor biopsies, and it promotes human prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.

Our aim was to quantify the variations in PA and time spent sedentary between before and after diagnosis, relying on prospective data in French adults. We also investigated sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with these variations.Subjects (n = 942) were incident cancer cases diagnosed in the NutriNet-Santé cohort between 2009 and 2015. PA and sedentary behavior were prospectively collected with the 7-day short version of the IPAQ questionnaire every year since subjects' inclusion (i.e., an average of 2 year before diagnosis). All PA and sitting time points before and after diagnosis was compared by mixed model. Factors associated with decrease in PA and increase in sitting time were investigated using logistic regressions.Overall and vigorous PA decreased after diagnosis (P = 0.006, -32.8 ± 36.8 MET-hour/week on average, in those who decreased their overall PA and P = 0.005, -21.1 ± 36.8 MET-hour/week for vigorous PA, respectively), especially in prostate (-39.5 ± 36.3 MET-hour/week) and skin (-35.9 ± 38 MET-hour/week) cancers, in men (-40.8 ± 46.3MET-hour/week), and in those professionally inactive (-34.2 ± 37.1 MET-hour/week) (all P < 0.05). Patients with higher PA level before diagnosis were more likely to decrease their PA (odds ratio [OR]: 4.67 [3.21-6.81], P < 0.0001). Overweight patients more likely to decrease moderate PA (OR: 1.45 [1.11-1.89], P = 0.006) and walking (OR: 1.30 [1.10-1.70], P = 0.04). Sitting time increased (P = 0.02, +2.44 ± 2.43 hour/day on average, in those who increased their sitting time), especially in women (+2.48 ± 2.48 hour/day), older patients (+2.48 ± 2.57 hour/day), and those professionally inactive (2.41 ± 2.40 hour/day) (all P < 0.05). Patients less sedentary before diagnosis were more likely to increase their sitting time (OR: 3.29 [2.45-4.42], P < 0.0001).This large prospective study suggests that cancer diagnosis is a key period for change in PA and sedentary behavior.

Using a standard operating protocol for sample collection, processing, and analysis, we compared detection rates of CellSearch performed using US Food and Drug Administration-cleared methodology with a second positive selection assay, AdnaTest, and a nonselection polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based (direct detection PCR [DDPCR]) assay in 55 blood samples from 47 men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. AdnaTest requires processing within 4 hours of the draw and detects KLK3, PSMA, and EGFR transcripts in cells captured on magnetic beads. The DDPCR assay can be processed up to 7 days after a draw and detects KLK2, KLK3, HOXB13, GRHL2, and FOXA1 genes. AdnaTest and DDPCR were considered positive if at least 1 transcript was detected. AdnaTest detected CTCs in 34 samples (62%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48%-75%), of which 23 (68%) had unfavorable CTC counts by CellSearch. A positive DDPCR result was seen in 38 cases (69%; 95% CI, 55%-81%), including 24 (63%) with unfavorable CellSearch CTC counts. CellSearch found unfavorable CTC counts in 25 samples (45%; 95% CI, 33%-58%). Sensitivities were similar between the AdnaTest and DDPCR assays, and both were more sensitive than CellSearch.

The aim of this study was to assess the proportion and characteristics of men in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden with unknown risk category.  Material and methods:   Men diagnosed with Pca between 1998 and 2012 registered in NPCR with known or unknown risk category were compared with respect to age, socioeconomic factors, comorbidity, cancer characteristics, cancer treatment, and mortality from Pca and other causes.  Results:   In total, 3315 of 129 391 (3%) men had unknown risk category.

The blood prostate-specific antigen test has facilitated early detection and intervention of prostate cancer. However, blood prostate-specific antigen levels are less effective in distinguishing aggressive from indolent prostate cancers and other benign prostatic diseases. Thus, the development of novel approaches specific for prostate cancer that can differentiate aggressive from indolent disease remains an urgent medical need. In the current study, we evaluated urine specimens from prostate cancer patients using LC-MS/MS, with the aim of identifying effective urinary prostate cancer biomarkers. Glycoproteins from urine samples of prostate cancer patients with different Gleason scores were characterized via solid phase extraction of N-linked glycosite-containing peptides and LC-MS/MS. A total of 2923 unique glycosite-containing peptides were identified. Glycoproteomic comparison on urine and tissues from aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers as well as sera from prostate cancer patients revealed that the majority of AG prostate cancer associated glycoproteins were more readily detected in patient's urine than serum samples.

Materials and methods:   In all, 292 patients who received radical prostatectomy and underwent preoperative mpMRI at 3T were enrolled retrospectively. For determining the associations with ECE, the likelihood of ECE was assessed qualitatively on T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) and combined T2 WI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCEI). Quantitative MRI parameters were measured in PCa based on histopathological findings. Two models for detecting ECE including imaging and clinical parameters were developed using multivariate analysis: Model 1 excluding combined T2 WI and DWI and DCEI and Model 2 excluding combined T2 WI and DWI, and combined T2 WI and DCEI. Diagnostic performance of imaging parameters and models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (Az).  Results:   For detecting ECE, the specificity, accuracy, and Az of combined T2 WI and DWI or DCEI were statistically better than those of T2 WI (P < 0.05), and all quantitative MRI parameters showed a statistical difference between the patients with and without ECE (P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, significant independent markers in Model 1 were combined T2 WI and DWI, combined T2 WI and DCEI, and Ktrans (P < 0.05). In Model 2, significant markers were combined T2 WI and DWI and DCEI, Ktrans , Kep , and Ve (P < 0.05). The Az values of models 1 and 2 were 0.944 and 0.957, respectively.

Bax-interacting factor-1 (Bif-1) is a member of Endophilin family, which binds to and activates the BAX protein in response to the apoptosis signaling pathway. Loss of Bif-1 may suppress the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and promote tumorigenesis, but there is also converse evidence that Bif-1 could in part be responsible for the tumorigenesis and the role of Bif-1 in PCa development is not clear. In the present study, we aimed to understand the relationships between Bif-1 expression and PCa development. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Bif-1 in PCa cell lines, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n=100) and PCa tissues (n=100, including low Gleason-scored PCa n=43 and high Gleason-scored PCa n=57) were detected and the effects of Bif-1 overexpression on the apoptosis, proliferation and migration in LNCaP cells were explored. Bif-1 mRNA levels of PCa cell lines were analyzed by real-time PCR and the protein levels were detected by western blotting. Bif-1 expression in BPH and PCa samples was detected by immunohistochemistry. To build Bif-1 overexpression PCa cells, Bif-1 gene was transfected into LNCaP cells by pcDNA3.1(+)‑Bif-1 vector. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometric analysis, cell proliferation measured by 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cell migration was analyzed by wound‑healing assay. The results proved that Bif-1 is downregulated in both PCa cell lines (P<0.01) and clinical samples (P<0.05), and Bif-1 expression is suppressed with the cancer progression (BPH vs. PCa P<0.01, and low Gleason-scored PCa vs. high Gleason-scored PCa P<0.05). Overexpression of Bif-1 could significantly inhibit cell proliferation (P<0.05) and enhancing PCa cell apoptosis (P<0.05), but it did not affect the migration ability (P>0.05). Our findings give strong evidence that Bif-1 is involved in PCa tumorigenesis and acts as a suppressor in PCa progression, and may have significance in understanding the process of PCa development.""","""['Lin Xu', 'Zhu Wang', 'Shan-Yang He', 'Su-Fen Zhang', 'Hong-Jiao Luo', 'Kai Zhou', 'Xiao-Fei Li', 'Shao-Peng Qiu', 'Kai-Yuan Cao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Bax-interacting factor-1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of endonuclease domain-containing 1 as a novel tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of downregulation of prostate cancer antigen-1 expression on malignant biological behavior of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Functional Analyses of Bovine Foamy Virus-Encoded miRNAs Reveal the Importance of a Defined miRNA for Virus Replication and Host-Virus Interaction.', 'Mutations in KIAA1109, CACNA1C, BSN, AKAP13, CELSR2, and HELZ2 Are Associated With the Prognosis in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Analyses of long non-coding RNA and mRNA profiling using RNA sequencing in calcium oxalate monohydrate-stimulated renal tubular epithelial cells.', 'Clinical significance of LMO1 in gastric cancer tissue and its association with apoptosis of cancer cells.', 'Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.']"""

We found that miR-382 was significantly decreased in prostate cancer specimens and cancer cell lines. The overexpression of miR-382 in prostate cancer cells markedly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In contrast, miR-382 suppression exhibited an opposite effect. Target analysis predicted that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP‑TFII) was a direct target of miR-382. This prediction was experimentally confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis. Our results further demonstrated that miR-382 inhibited the downstream genes of COUP‑TFII, including Snail and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Moreover, the restoration of COUP‑TFII expression significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of miR-382 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and Snail expression.

Proteins belonging to this family have been reported to be involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, differentiation and pathogenesis. TRIM16 expression has been detected in most tissues. However, the funtions of this gene remain to be elucidated. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the expression of TRIM16 was decreased in prostate adenocarcinoma compared with that in normal prostate tissues. The patients with high TRIM16-expressing tumors had a significantly greater survival than those with low TRIM16-expressing tumors. Western blot analysis showed that TRIM16 was downregulated in distant metastatic cancer tissues compared with that in non-distant metastatic cancer tissues. The overexpression of TRIM16 inhibited the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells as well as inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, whereas TRIM16 depletion enhanced these processes. Moreover, TRIM16 inhibited the Snail signaling pathway. The silencing of Snail by small interfering RNA was performed in order to determine the role of Snail in the TRIM16-mediated tumor phenotype.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) was successfully used in several human cancer cell lines to reactivate oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The aim of this study was the characterization and response of canine cancer cell lines after DCA exposure. The effect of 10 mM DCA was characterized in vitro on a set of six canine prostate adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) derived cell lines. Cell counts, lactate levels, apoptosis, expression of apoptotic proteins, survival factors and different miRNAs were analyzed. Additionally, metabolic activity, mitochondrial activity and proliferation were investigated. DCA significantly decreased cell number of all but one utilized cell lines and leads to a significant reduction of lactate release. Decreased survivin levels were found in all cell lines, two of which presented a significant reduction in metabolic activity. Increased miR-375 levels were measured in all TCC cell lines. Reactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and an elevated mitochondrial activity appear to induce the transition from aerobic glycolysis back to oxidative phosphorylation.

Restoring PTEN activity in cancer cells through gene therapy has shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, particularly in cells with a PTEN deficiency. Gene therapy, however, comes with some inherent risks such as triggering an immune response and permanent off target effects. Nanoparticle assisted protein delivery could mitigate these liabilities while maintaining therapeutic integrity. In this report, we evaluated the use of cationic lipid-like (lipidoid) materials to intracellularly deliver the PTEN protein. We synthesized a small library of cationic lipidoid materials and screened for the delivery of PTEN based on cell viability. The lipidoid material EC16-80 was selected for high efficacy and the subsequent lipidoid-protein complex was characterized using DLS, zeta potential, and TEM. Intracellular delivery of PTEN with EC16-80 to the PTEN deficient prostate cancer cell line PC-3 resulted in a significant decrease in activated AKT and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, delivery of PTEN to PTEN deficient prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP compared to the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 with endogenous PTEN, resulted in significantly lower IC50 values in PC-3 and LNCaP cells indicating that the treatment is predominantly specific to PTEN-deficient cells.

However, coadministration of prednisone is required to suppress the mineralocorticoid excess and cortisol depletion that result from hydroxylase inhibition. VT-464, a nonsteroidal small molecule, selectively inhibits CYP17A1 lyase and therefore does not require prednisone supplementation. Administration of VT-464 in a metastatic CRPC patient presenting with high tumoral expression of both androgen receptor (AR) and CYP17A1, showed significant reduction in the level of both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and serum PSA. Treatment of a CRPC patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-133 expressing H874Y AR mutant with VT-464, reduced the increase in tumor volume in castrate male mice more than twice as much as the vehicle (P < 0.05).

Methods:   Complete records of 223 of the 489 patients with metastatic PC were obtained from computerized data based system in a tertiary care hospital in north India between January 2000 to June 2012. Patients with follow up of < 6 months were excluded. Age (≤ and > 65 yr), baseline PSA (< and ≥ 50 ng/ml), bone scan and Gleason score (≤7 and >7) were recorded. Extent of bone disease (EOD) was stratified according to the number of bone lesions i.e., < 5, 5-10, > 10. CRPC was defined as two consecutive PSA rise of > 50 per cent from nadir or an absolute value of > 5 ng/ml.  Results:   Mean age of patients was 61.5 ± 12.45 yr and their PSA level was 325.6 ± 631.35 ng/dl. Of the 223 patients, 193 (86%) progressed to CRPC at median time of 10.7 (4-124) months. Median follow up was 24 (6-137) months. On univariate and multivariate analyses EOD on bone scan was found to be a significant predictor ( P=0.006) for time to CRPC. Median time to CRPC was 10 months (CI 95%, 7.5-12.48) with >10 lesions or super scan versus 16 months (CI 95%, 10.3-21.6) with <10 bone lesion (P=0.01). Ninety (46.6 %) patients of CRPC died with median time to death from time of CRPC 21 (10-120) months.  Interpretation & conclusions:   Median time for progression of metastatic PC to CRPC ranged from 10-16 months depending on the extent of the bone involvement. In Indians, the aggressive course of advanced prostate cancer warrants further clinical trials to explore the need for additional treatment along with initial castration.""","""['Sanjoy Kumar Sureka', 'Ruchir Maheshwari', 'Shalini Agnihotri', 'Nilay Mitash', 'Shamim Ahmad', 'Anil Mandhani']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Indian J Med Res""","""['Bone Scan Index Is an Independent Predictor of Time to Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Prognostic Impacts of Metastatic Site and Pain on Progression to Castrate Resistance and Mortality in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone Scan Index predicts outcome in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Understanding prostate-specific antigen dynamics in monitoring metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for clinical practice.', 'Predicting the risk of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of a novel risk model in newly diagnosed de novo bone metastatic prostate cancer (M1b): a retrospective study.', 'Clinicopathological Features, Treatment, and Outcome of Omani Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Rapidly decreasing level of prostate-specific antigen during initial androgen deprivation therapy is a risk factor for early progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.']"""

We describe a multisite experience of the efficacy and safety of the positron emission tomography/computerized tomography agent fluciclovine (18F) after biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   A total of 596 patients underwent fluciclovine (18F) positron emission tomography/computerized tomography at 4 clinical sites. Detection rate determinations were stratified by the baseline prostate specific antigen value. Diagnostic performance was assessed against a histological reference standard in 143 scans.  Results:   The subject level fluciclovine (18F) positron emission tomography/computer tomography detection rate was 67.7% (403 of 595 scans). Positive findings were detected in the prostate/bed and pelvic lymph node regions in 38.7% (232 of 599) and 32.6% of scans (194 of 596), respectively.

The neurovascular bundles (NVB) that lie posterolaterally to the prostate are typically spared during prostatectomy, but in traditional radiotherapy planning they are not contoured as an organ-at-risk with dose constraints. Our goal was to determine the dosimetric feasibility of ""NVB-sparing"" prostate radiotherapy while still delivering adequate dose to the prostate.  Methods:   Twenty-five consecutive patients with prostate cancer (with no extraprostatic disease on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) who that were treated with external beam radiotherapy, with the same primary planning target volume margins, to a dose of 79.2 Gy were evaluated. Pelvic MRI and simulation computed tomography scans were registered using dedicated software to allow for bilateral NVB target delineation on T2-weighted MRI. A volumetric modulated arc therapy plan was generated using the NVB bilaterally with 2 mm margin as an organ to spare and compared to the patient's previously delivered plan. Dose-volume histogram endpoints for NVB, rectum, bladder, and planning target volume 79.2 were compared between the 2 plans using a 2-tailed paired t-test.  Results:   The V70 for the NVB was significantly lower on the NVB-sparing plan (p <0.01), while rectum and bladder endpoints were similar. Target V100% was similar but V105% was higher for the NVB-sparing plans (p <0.01).  Conclusions:   ""NVB-sparing"" radiotherapy is dosimetrically feasible using CT-MRI registration, and for volumetric modulated arc therapy technology - target coverage is acceptable without increased dose to other normal structures, but with higher target dose inhomogeneity.

Methods and materials:   Individual data from 1108 patients who underwent salvage RT at 10 academic centers were pooled. The cohort was enriched for selection criteria more likely associated with tumor recurrence in the prostate bed (margin positive and pre-RT prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level of ≤2.0 ng/mL) and without the confounding of planned androgen suppression. The cumulative incidence of biochemical failure and distant metastasis over time was computed, and competing risks hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between potential predictors and these outcomes. The association of radiation dose with outcomes was the primary focus.  Results:   With a 65.2-month follow-up duration, the 5- and 10-year estimates of freedom from post-RT biochemical failure (PSA level >0.2 ng/mL and rising) was 63.5% and 49.8%, respectively, and the cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 12.4% by 10 years. A Gleason score of ≥7, higher pre-RT PSA level, extraprostatic tumor extension, and seminal vesicle invasion were associated with worse biochemical failure and distant metastasis outcomes. A salvage radiation dose of ≥66.0 Gy was associated with a reduced cumulative incidence of biochemical failure, but not of distant metastasis.  Conclusions:   The use of salvage radiation doses of ≥66.0 Gy are supported by evidence presented in the present multicenter pooled analysis of individual patient data.

Methods:   Data on PCa incidence in 2003-2007 for 49 countries with either nationwide cancer registry or at least two regional registries were obtained from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol X and national PCa mortality for 2012 from GLOBOCAN 2012. We compared PCa incidence and mortality rates with various population-level indicators of health, economy and development in 2000. Poisson and linear regression methods were used to quantify the associations.  Results:   PCa incidence varied more than 15-fold, being highest in high-income countries. PCa mortality exhibited less variation, with higher rates in many low- and middle-income countries. Healthcare expenditure (rate ratio, RR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.45-1.47) and population growth (RR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.14-1.16), as well as computer and mobile phone density, were associated with a higher PCa incidence, while gross domestic product, GDP (RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.93-0.95) and overall mortality (RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.71-0.73) were associated with a low incidence. GDP (RR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.46-0.66) was also associated with a low PCa mortality, while life expectancy (RR 3.93, 95 % CI 3.22-4.79) and healthcare expenditure (RR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.09-1.32) were associated with an elevated mortality.  Conclusions:   Our results show that healthcare expenditure and, thus, the availability of medical resources are an important contributor to the patterns of international variation in PCa incidence. This suggests that there is an iatrogenic component in the current global epidemic of PCa.

To examine the factors predicting unfavorable pathology among active surveillance candidates, we assessed low-risk radical prostatectomy specimens.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 1753 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy at six independent institutions in Japan from 2005 to 2011. Patients who met the active surveillance criteria were categorized depending on the pathological features of the radical prostatectomy specimens. 'Reclassification' was defined as upstaging (≥pT3) or upgrading (radical prostatectomy Gleason score ≥7), and 'adverse pathology' was defined as pathological stage ≥pT3 or radical prostatectomy Gleason score ≥4 + 3. Multivariate analysis was used to analyze the preoperative factors for reclassification and adverse pathology. The rates of reclassification and adverse pathology were evaluated by classifying patients according to biopsy core numbers.  Results:   The active surveillance criteria were met by 284 cases. Reclassification was identified in 154 (54.2%) cases, while adverse pathology in 60 (21.1%) cases. Prostate-specific antigen density and percentage of positive cores were independently associated with reclassification and adverse pathology. The rates of reclassification and adverse pathology were significantly higher among patients with <10 biopsy cores than among others. Thus, focusing on 149 patients with ≥10 biopsy cores, prostate-specific antigen density was the only independent predictor of unfavorable pathological features.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively identified 2366 men receiving permanent prostate brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy. Patients experiencing BCR were stratified by receipt of immediate or delayed (≥3 months) ADT and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure threshold of 10 ng/mL. Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) were evaluated using Fine-Gray's competing risks regression and Cox proportional hazard model, respectively.  Results:   We identified 109 patients in the study cohort treated with ADT for BCR, followed for a median of 11.4 years. Competing risk regression revealed that there was no difference in PCSM for patients receiving delayed vs. immediate ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-2.00: p = 0.871) or for those initiating hormonal therapy at PSA threshold of 10 vs. <10 ng/mL (HR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.41-1.75; p = 0.649); similarly, there was no difference in ACM.

Methods and materials:   Between December 2009 and March 2011, 20 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent multiparametric MRI/MRS protocol before treatment. All patients were treated with an external beam radiotherapy dose of 40 Gy, combined with an HDR brachytherapy boost of 15 Gy. Concurrently, the DIL received a boost of 18 Gy. Missing data during followup were handled with multiple imputations.  Results:   The median followup was 62 months (range, 23-71 months).

We aimed to develop and validate a gene expression signature to predict which patients would benefit most from postoperative radiotherapy.  Methods:   Patients were eligible for this matched, retrospective study if they were included in one of five published US studies (cohort, case-cohort, and case-control studies) of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who had radical prostatectomy (with or without postoperative radiotherapy) and had gene expression analysis of the tumour, with long-term follow-up and complete clinicopathological data. Additional treatment after surgery was at the treating physician's discretion. In each cohort, patients who had postoperative radiotherapy were matched with patients who had not had radiotherapy using Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen concentration, surgical margin status, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node invasion, and androgen deprivation therapy. We constructed a matched training cohort using patients from one study in which we developed a 24-gene Post-Operative Radiation Therapy Outcomes Score (PORTOS). We generated a pooled matched validation cohort using patients from the remaining four studies. The primary endpoint was the development of distant metastasis.  Findings:   In the training cohort (n=196), among patients with a high PORTOS (n=39), those who had radiotherapy had a lower incidence of distant metastasis than did patients who did not have radiotherapy, with a 10-year metastasis rate of 5% (95% CI 0-14) in patients who had radiotherapy (n=20) and 63% (34-80) in patients who did not have radiotherapy (n=19; hazard ratio [HR] 0·12 [95% CI 0·03-0·41], p<0·0001), whereas among patients with a low PORTOS (n=157), those who had postoperative radiotherapy (n=78) had a greater incidence of distant metastasis at 10 years than did their untreated counterparts (n=79; 57% [44-67] vs 31% [20-41]; HR 2·5 [1·6-4·1], p<0·0001), with a significant treatment interaction (pinteraction<0·0001). The finding that PORTOS could predict outcome due to radiotherapy treatment was confirmed in the validation cohort (n=330), which showed that patients who had radiotherapy had a lower incidence of distant metastasis compared with those who did not have radiotherapy, but only in the high PORTOS group (high PORTOS [n=82]: 4% [95% CI 0-10] in the radiotherapy group [n=57] vs 35% [95% CI 7-54] in the no radiotherapy group [n=25] had metastasis at 10 years; HR 0·15 [95% CI 0·04-0·60], p=0·0020; low PORTOS [n=248]: 32% [95% CI 19-43] in the radiotherapy group [n=108] vs 32% [95% CI 22-40] in the no radiotherapy group [n=140]; HR 0·92 [95% CI 0·56-1·51], p=0·76), with a significant interaction (pinteraction=0·016). The conventional prognostic tools Decipher, CAPRA-S, and microarray version of the cell cycle progression signature did not predict response to radiotherapy (pinteraction>0·05 for all).  Interpretation:   Patients with a high PORTOS who had postoperative radiotherapy were less likely to have metastasis at 10 years than those who did not have radiotherapy, suggesting that treatment with postoperative radiotherapy should be considered in this subgroup. PORTOS should be investigated further in additional independent cohorts.

We aim to evaluate the current knowledge, attitude, and practice patterns of urologists regarding this new technique.  Methods:   An anonymous online questionnaire was designed to collect information on urologists' beliefs and use of prostate multiparametric MRI and MR-targeted biopsy. The survey was sent to members of the Society of Urologic Oncology, the Endourological Society, and European Association of Urology. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors for use of prostate MRI and MR-targeted biopsy.  Results:   A total of 302 responses were received (Endourological Society: 175, European Association of Urology: 23, and Society of Urologic Oncology: 104). Most respondents (83.6%) believe MR-targeted biopsy to be moderately to extremely beneficial in the evaluation of prostate cancer. Overall, 85.7% of responders use prostate MRI in their practice, and 63.0% use MR-targeted biopsy. The 2 most common settings for use of MR-targeted biopsy include patients with history of prior negative biopsy result (96.3%) and monitoring patients on active surveillance (72.5%). In those who do not use MR-targeted biopsy, the principal reasons were lack of necessary infrastructure (64.1%) and prohibitive costs (48.1%). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, practice in an academic setting (1.86 [1.02-3.40], P = 0.043) and performing greater than 25 radical prostatectomies per year (2.32 [1.18-4.56], P = 0.015) remained independent predictors for using MR-targeted biopsy.  Conclusions:   Most respondents of our survey look favorably on use of prostate MRI and MR-targeted biopsy in clinical practice.

Although bladder neck intussusception has been reported to accelerate urinary recovery after open radical retropubic prostatectomy, its adaption to robotic surgery has not been assessed. Accordingly, we describe our technique and compare outcomes between men treated with and without bladder neck intussusception during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a comparative trial of 48 men undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy alternating between bladder neck intussusception (n = 24) and nonintussusception (n = 24). Intussusception was completed using 3-0 polyglycolic acid horizontal mattress sutures anterior and posterior to the bladder neck. We assessed baseline characteristics and clinicopathologic outcomes. Adjusting for age, body mass index, race, and D׳Amico risk classification, we prospectively compared urinary function at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, and last follow-up using the urinary domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-Short Form.  Results:   Baseline patient characteristics and clinicopathologic outcomes were similar between treatment groups (P>0.05). Median catheter duration (8 vs. 8d, P = 0.125) and rates of major postoperative complications (4.2% vs. 4.2%, P = 1.000) did not differ. In adjusted analyses, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-Short Form urinary scores were significantly higher for the intussusception arm at 2 weeks (65.4 vs. 46.6, P = 0.019) before converging at 2 months (69.1 vs. 68.3, P = 0.929) after catheter removal and at last follow-up (median = 7mo, 80.5 vs. 77.0; P = 0.665).

SPS-7 is the most effective derivative displaying higher activity than FTY720 in anti-proliferation against human hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). It induced G1 arrest of cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis in thymidine block-mediated synchronization model. The data were supported by a decrease of cyclin D1 expression, a dramatic increase of p21 expression and an associated decrease in RB phosphorylation. c-Myc overexpression replenished protein levels of cyclin D1 indicating that c-Myc was responsible for cell cycle regulation. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways through p70S6K- and 4EBP1-mediated translational regulation are critical to cell proliferation and survival. SPS-7 significantly inhibited this translational pathway. Overexpression of Myr-Akt (constitutively active Akt) completely abolished SPS-7-induced inhibitory effect on mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 signaling and c-Myc protein expression, suggesting that PI3K/Akt serves as a key upstream regulator. SPS-7 also demonstrated substantial anti-tumor efficacy in an in vivo xenograft study using PC-3 mouse model.

In conclusion, the data suggest that SPS-7 is not an immunosuppressant while induces anticancer effect against HRPC through inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathwaysthat down-regulate protein levels of both c-Myc and cyclin D1, leading to G1 arrest of cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis.

Expression of novel tumor associated antigens can improve immune recognition and lysis of tumor cells. The cancer-testis antigen (CTA) family of proteins has been hypothesized to be an ideal class of antigens due to tumor-restricted expression, a subset of which have been found to induce antibody responses in patients with prostate disease. We demonstrate that CTA expression is highly inducible in five different Prostate Cancer (PC) cell lines using a hypomethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA) and/or a histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589. These CTAs include NY-ESO1, multiple members of the MAGE and SSX families and NY-SAR35. A subset of CTAs is synergistically induced by the combination of 5AZA and LBH589. We developed an ex vivo organ culture using human PC biopsies for ex vivo drug treatments to evaluate these agents in clinical samples. These assays found significant induction of SSX2 in 9/9 distinct patient samples and NY-SAR35 in 7/9 samples. Further, we identify expression of SSX2 in circulating tumor cells (CTC) from patients with advanced PC. These results indicate that epigenetic modifying agents can induce expression of a broad range of neoantigens in human PC and may serve as a useful adjunctive therapy with novel tumor vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors.""","""['Erika Heninger', 'Timothy E G Krueger', 'Stephanie M Thiede', 'Jamie M Sperger', 'Brianna L Byers', 'Madison R Kircher', 'David Kosoff', 'Bing Yang', 'David F Jarrard', 'Douglas G McNeel', 'Joshua M Lang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Expression and immunotherapeutic targeting of the SSX family of cancer-testis antigens in prostate cancer.', 'Inducible expression of a prostate cancer-testis antigen, SSX-2, following treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor.', 'Cancer-testis antigen expression and its epigenetic modulation in acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: Expression, Regulation, Tumor Invasion, and Use in Immunotherapy of Cancers.', 'Cancer-testis antigens: promising targets for antigen directed antineoplastic immunotherapy.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations regulate class I HLA loss in prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of indolence in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Novel TCR-like CAR-T cells targeting an HLA∗0201-restricted SSX2 epitope display strong activity against acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Empirical and Rational Design of T Cell Receptor-Based Immunotherapies.', ""5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine induces a greater inflammatory change, at the molecular levels, in normoxic than hypoxic tumor microenvironment.""]"""

Recent evidence demonstrated that ferroportin (FPN) reduction lead to decreased iron export and increased intercellular iron that consequently aggravates the oncogenic effects of iron. In the present study, ZNF217 was identified as a transcriptional repressor that inhibits FPN expression. Increased of ZNF217 expression led to decreased FPN concentration, coupled with resultant intracellular iron retention, increased iron-related cellular activities and enhanced tumor cell growth. In contrast, decreased of ZNF217 expression restrained tumor cell growth by promoting FPN-driven iron egress. Mechanistic investigation manifested that ZNF217 facilitated the H3K27me3 levels of FPN promoter by interacting with EZH2. Besides, we also found that MAZ increased the transcription level of ZNF217, and subsequently inhibited the FPN expression and their iron-related activities. Strikingly, the expression of MAZ, EZH2 and ZNF217 were concurrently upregulated in PCa, leading to decreased expression of FPN, which induce disordered iron metabolism.

Models from the United States show that greater use of active surveillance is important for prostate cancer screening to be cost-effective.  Objectives:   To perform an up-to-date, nationwide, population-based study on use of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer in Sweden.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cross-sectional study in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden from 2009 through 2014. The NPCR has data on 98% of prostate cancers diagnosed in Sweden and has comprehensive linkages to other nationwide databases. Overall, 32 518 men with a median age of 67 years were diagnosed with favorable-risk prostate cancer, including 4693, 15 403, and 17 115 men with very-low-risk (subset of the low-risk group) (clinical stage, T1c; Gleason score, ≤6; prostate-specific antigen [PSA], <10 ng/mL; PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cm3; and <8-mm total cancer length in ≤4 positive biopsy cores), low-risk (including all men in the very-low-risk group) (T1-T2; Gleason score, ≤6; and PSA, <10 ng/mL), and intermediate-risk disease (T1-T2 with Gleason score, 7 and/or PSA, 10-20 ng/mL).  Exposures:   Diagnosis with favorable-risk prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   Utilization of active surveillance.  Results:   The use of active surveillance increased in men of all ages from 57% (380 of 665) to 91% (939 of 1027) for very-low-risk prostate cancer and from 40% (1159 of 2895) to 74% (1951 of 2644) for low-risk prostate cancer, with the strongest increase occurring from 2011 onward. Among men aged 50 to 59 years, 88% (211 of 240) with very-low-risk and 68% (351 of 518) with low-risk disease chose active surveillance in 2014. Use of active surveillance for intermediate-risk disease remained lower, 19% (561 of 3030) in 2014.  Conclusions and relevance:   Active surveillance has become the dominant management for low-risk prostate cancer among men in Sweden, with the highest rates yet reported and almost complete uptake for very-low-risk cancer. These data should serve as a benchmark to compare the use of active surveillance for favorable-risk disease around the world.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Yasin Folkvaljon', 'Caitlin Curnyn', 'David Robinson', 'Ola Bratt', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer-An Evolving International Standard of Care.', 'Population based study of use and determinants of active surveillance and watchful waiting for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.', 'Five-year nationwide follow-up study of active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Variations in the Uptake of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer and Its Impact on Outcomes.', 'Changing nationwide trends away from overtreatment among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy over the past 25\xa0years.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Use of Active Surveillance vs Definitive Treatment Among Men With Low- and Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer in the US Between 2010 and 2018.', 'Time Trends and Variation in the Use of Active Surveillance for Management of Low-risk Prostate Cancer in the US.']"""

Lectins are a special kind of glycan-binding protein and the lectin-based LFA herein described was developed for the determination of the glycosylation of free prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is routinely used as a biomarker of prostate cancer (PCa) and the glycosylation status of PSA is a more specific marker of disease progress than only the PSA level. Using the lectin-based LFA we were able to detect α-2,6 sialic acid present in fPSA using Sambucus nigra (SNA) lectin. As a negative control, we employed Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAA II) which specifically binds α-2,3 sialic acid. The novel approach presented here can be applied to a wide range of biomarkers that have a significant impact on clinical diagnosis and prognosis, providing an alternative to standard lectin-based assays.

The aim of this study was to provide a complete characterization of all possible associations between individual T2DM therapies, statin use and site-specific cancers in the Austrian population.  Methods:   Medical claims data of 1 847 051 patients with hospital stays during 2006-2007 were used to estimate age- and sex-dependent co-occurrences of site-specific cancer diagnoses and treatment with specific glucose-lowering drugs and statins.  Results:   Patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues showed up to ninefold increased risks for cancers of the colon [males only (m)], liver (m), pancreas, lung (m) and brain (m), as well as a strongly decreased risk for prostate cancer (m). In patients taking statins, the risks were generally decreased, with a greater risk reduction in patients not receiving antihyperglycaemic therapies. The strongest effects were observed for use of insulin and pancreatic cancer [m: OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.1-6.6; females (f): OR 4.2, 95% CI: 2.5-7.1], sulfonylureas (m: OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.6; f: OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.2) or glitazones and skin cancer (f: OR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80), as well as metformin and cancer of the prostate (m: OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75-0.91) and corpus uteri (f: OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.0) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (f: OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64-0.91).  Conclusions:   The use of statins offsets insulin-related cancer risks in patients with diabetes independently of sex and age. Overall, our data support the hyperglycaemia-cancer hypothesis.

To enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying human bone metastases and in order to find new therapies, we developed an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cancer-bone metastasis model by culturing human breast or prostate cancer cells with human bone tissue isolated from female and male patients, respectively.

Initiated by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine, a retrospective multicenter data analysis was started in 2015 to evaluate efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients.  Methods:   One hundred forty-five patients (median age, 73 y; range, 43-88 y) with mCRPC were treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 12 therapy centers between February 2014 and July 2015 with 1-4 therapy cycles and an activity range of 2-8 GBq per cycle. Toxicity was categorized by the common toxicity criteria for adverse events (version 4.0) on the basis of serial blood tests and the attending physician's report. The primary endpoint for efficacy was biochemical response as defined by a prostate-specific antigen decline ≥ 50% from baseline to at least 2 wk after the start of RLT.  Results:   A total of 248 therapy cycles were performed in 145 patients. Data for biochemical response in 99 patients as well as data for physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity in 145 and 121 patients, respectively, were available. The median follow-up was 16 wk (range, 2-30 wk). Nineteen patients died during the observation period. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity occurred in 18 patients: 10%, 4%, and 3% of the patients experienced anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, respectively. Xerostomia occurred in 8%. The overall biochemical response rate was 45% after all therapy cycles, whereas 40% of patients already responded after a single cycle. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and the presence of visceral metastases were negative predictors and the total number of therapy cycles positive predictors of biochemical response.  Conclusion:   The present retrospective multicenter study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT demonstrates favorable safety and high efficacy exceeding those of other third-line systemic therapies in mCRPC patients. Future phase II/III studies are warranted to elucidate the survival benefit of this new therapy in patients with mCRPC.""","""['Kambiz Rahbar', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Michael Schäfers', 'Markus Essler', 'Richard P Baum', 'Harshad R Kulkarni', 'Matthias Schmidt', 'Alexander Drzezga', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Andreas Pfestroff', 'Markus Luster', 'Ulf Lützen', 'Marlies Marx', 'Vikas Prasad', 'Winfried Brenner', 'Alexander Heinzel', 'Felix M Mottaghy', 'Juri Ruf', 'Philipp Tobias Meyer', 'Martin Heuschkel', 'Maria Eveslage', 'Martin Bögemann', 'Wolfgang Peter Fendler', 'Bernd Joachim Krause']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['From NETTER to PETTER: PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy.', 'Efficacy and safety of 225Ac-PSMA-617 targeted alpha therapy in metastatic castration-resistant Prostate Cancer patients.', 'Response and Tolerability of a Single Dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Multicenter Retrospective Analysis.', 'A Single-Arm, Low-Dose, Prospective Study of 177Lu-EB-PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', '177Lu-PSMA therapy : Current evidence for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Individualized precision medicine.', 'Early biochemical and radiographic response after one cycle of 177LuLu-PSMA I&T radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'The current status of prostate cancer treatment and PSMA theranostics.', 'New perspectives on metabolic imaging in the management of prostate cancer in 2022: A focus on radiolabeled PSMA‑PET/CT (Review).']"""

However, the effectiveness of this class of drugs has been associated with various side effects and drug resistance. We previously reported that fisetin, a hydroxyflavone, is a microtubule-stabilizing agent and inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suggested its use as an adjuvant for treatment of prostate and other cancer types. In this study, we investigated the effect of fisetin in combination with cabazitaxel with the objective to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit, reduce dose and toxicity, and minimize or delay the induction of drug resistance and metastasis. Our data show for the first time that a combination of fisetin (20 μmol/L) enhances cabazitaxel (5 nmol/L) and synergistically reduces 22Rν1, PC-3M-luc-6, and C4-2 cell viability and metastatic properties with minimal adverse effects on normal prostate epithelial cells. In addition, the combination of fisetin with cabazitaxel was associated with inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis. Furthermore, combination treatment resulted in the inhibition of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis when assessed in two in vivo xenograft mouse models. These results provide evidence that fisetin may have therapeutic benefit for patients with advanced prostate cancer through enhancing the efficacy of cabazitaxel under both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent conditions. This study underscores the benefit of the combination of fisetin with cabazitaxel for the treatment of advanced and resistant prostate cancer and possibly other cancer types.

However, due to the development of drug resistance and tumor cell survival, a majority of these patients progress to the refractory state of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Thus, newer therapeutic agents and a better understanding of their mode of action are needed for treating these CRPC patients. We demonstrated previously that targeting the Binding Function 3 (BF3) pocket of the androgen receptor (AR) has great potential for treating patients with CRPC. Here, we explore the functional activity of this site by using an advanced BF3-specific small molecule (VPC-13566) that was previously reported to effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity and to displace the BAG1L peptide from the BF3 pocket. We show that VPC-13566 inhibits the growth of various prostate cancer cell lines, including an enzalutamide-resistant cell line, and reduces the growth of AR-dependent prostate cancer xenograft tumors in mice. Importantly, we have used this AR-BF3 binder as a chemical probe and identified a co-chaperone, small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein alpha (SGTA), as an important AR-BF3 interacting partner. Furthermore, we used this AR-BF3-directed small molecule to demonstrate that inhibition of AR activity through the BF3 functionality can block translocation of the receptor into the nucleus. These findings suggest that targeting the BF3 site has potential clinical importance, especially in the treatment of CRPC and provide novel insights on the functional role of the BF3 pocket.

PCa is a profoundly personal disease, considering the location and common sequelae of treatment. Deeply held patient self-perceptions regarding the etiology of a patient's PCa may generate lasting beliefs that impact satisfaction with treatment selection.  Materials and methods:   Third-party web-based surveys were sent to patients receiving radical prostatectomy for clinically localized PCa. Patients were queried regarding demographic characteristics, family history, socioeconomic status, sexual function, urinary control, and factors believed to cause their PCa.  Results:   Among respondents (293 of 524, 55.9%), 237 (81.5%) provided primary causes for PCa. Evidence-based answers were provided by 128 (53.5%) patients, whereas a wide range of non-evidence-based responses were provided by 49 (20.5%) patients. Forty patients (16.7%) were undecided, and 20 (8.3%) offered belief-based responses. Evidence-based responses were more common in patients with a family history of PCa (P <.01); however, no significant differences were seen among race, educational level, or income. Patients providing an evidence-based cause of PCa were more likely to be potent (P <.01). Providing a non-evidence-based cause for PCa was associated with considering surgery as a wrong decision in treatment selection.

Methods:   In a prospective cohort of 69 873 men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we examined associations of prediagnostic BMI across the adult life course with risk of incident prostate cancer and fatal prostate cancer (prostate cancer-specific mortality). At 13 years of follow-up, we identified 7822 incident prostate cancer cases, of which 3078 were aggressive and 255 fatal. BMI trajectories were determined using latent-class trajectory modeling. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   BMI at age 20 years, 50 years, and baseline questionnaire (mean age = 63 years) were associated with increased risks of fatal prostate cancer (HRs = 1.27-1.32 per five-unit increase). In five BMI trajectories identified, fatal prostate cancer risk was increased in men who had a normal BMI (HR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.21 to 3.12) or who were overweight (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.35 to 5.18) at age 20 years and developed obesity by baseline compared with men who maintained a normal BMI.

Some recent work has been done to automate the cell location and classification process to address these problems, employing image processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms to locate and classify cells in fluorescent microscope images. However, the type of machine learning method used is a part of the design space that has not been thoroughly explored. Thus, we have trained four ML algorithms on three different datasets. The trained ML algorithms locate and classify thousands of possible cells in a few minutes rather than a few hours, representing an order of magnitude increase in processing speed. Furthermore, some algorithms have a significantly (P < 0.05) higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than do other algorithms. Additionally, significant (P < 0.05) losses to performance occur when training on cell lines and testing on CTCs (and vice versa), indicating the need to train on a system that is representative of future unlabeled data.

The presence of ≥5 CTCs/7.5mL of blood is a poor prognosis indicator in metastatic PCa when assessed by the CellSearch® system, the ""gold standard"" clinical platform. However, ~35% of metastatic PCa patients assessed by CellSearch® have undetectable CTCs. We hypothesize that this is due to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and subsequent loss of necessary CTC detection markers, with important implications for PCa metastasis. Two pre-clinical assays were developed to assess human CTCs in xenograft models; one comparable to CellSearch® (EpCAM-based) and one detecting CTCs semi-independent of EMT status via combined staining with EpCAM/HLA (human leukocyte antigen). In vivo differences in CTC generation, kinetics, metastasis and EMT status were determined using 4 PCa models with progressive epithelial (LNCaP, LNCaP-C42B) to mesenchymal (PC-3, PC-3M) phenotypes. Assay validation demonstrated that the CellSearch®-based assay failed to detect a significant number (~40-50%) of mesenchymal CTCs. In vivo, PCa with an increasingly mesenchymal phenotype shed greater numbers of CTCs more quickly and with greater metastatic capacity than PCa with an epithelial phenotype. Notably, the CellSearch®-based assay captured the majority of CTCs shed during early-stage disease in vivo, and only after establishment of metastases were a significant number of undetectable CTCs present. This study provides important insight into the influence of EMT on CTC generation and subsequent metastasis, and highlights that novel technologies aimed at capturing mesenchymal CTCs may only be useful in the setting of advanced metastatic disease.""","""['Lori E Lowes', 'David Goodale', 'Ying Xia', 'Carl Postenka', 'Matthew M Piaseczny', 'Freeman Paczkowski', 'Alison L Allan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['EMT circulating tumor cells detected by cell-surface vimentin are associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Classification of circulating tumor cells by epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypes of circulating tumor cells correlate with the clinical stages and cancer metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells and Implications of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Current and future role of circulating tumor cells in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Ready for Prime Time?', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Cancer nanotechnology: current status and perspectives.', 'Enhancing the Screening Efficiency of Breast Cancer by Combining Conventional Medical Imaging Examinations With Circulating Tumor Cells.']"""

The majority of the patients (n = 298) were followed by watchful waiting after diagnosis. Tissue microarrays constructed from malignant and non-malignant prostate tissue were stained with an antibody against Caveolin-1. The staining pattern was scored and related to clinicopathologic parameters and outcome. Microdissection and qRT-PCR analysis of Cav-1 was done of the prostate stroma from non-malignant tissue and stroma from Gleason 3 and 4 tumors. Cav-1 RNA expression was highest in non-malignant tissue and decreased during cancer progression. High expression of Caveolin-1 in tumor stroma was associated with significantly longer cancer specific survival in prostate cancer patients. This association remained significant when Gleason score and local tumor stage were combined with Caveolin-1 in a Cox regression model. High stromal Caveolin-1 immunoreactivity in prostate tumors is associated with a favourable prognosis in prostate cancer patients managed by watchful waiting.

However, we learn from pivotal studies that forms of primary and acquired resistance to this drug exist. Patient selection becomes so crucial to optimize treatment results. Potential predictive biomarkers have been identified but are not yet validated. In this scenario, clinical features and disease characteristics may still be of value in selecting patients for different treatments. The objective of this retrospective study was to assess whether or not a correlation between duration of response to first androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC), and outcome of AA therapy exists. A retrospective analysis of clinical data of mCRPC patients treated with AA at two Italian cancer centers was carried out. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used to analyze survival data. Correlation between median duration of response to first ADT or median TTCRPC and the outcome of patients treated with AA was analyzed. From January 2015 to November 2015, data of 59 patients with mCRPC were collected. We observed no differences in patient's median progression-free survival (PFS) and biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), according to both median duration of response to first-line ADT (duration of first ADT<13 months: median PFS and bPFS were 11 and 5 months, respectively; duration of ADT≥13 months: median PFS and bPFS were 9 and 6 months, respectively) and median TTCRPC (TTCRPC<28 months: median PFS and bPFS were 8 and 5 months, respectively; TTCRPC≥28 months: median PFS and bPFS were 10 and 9 months, respectively). Overall survival, in the same group, did not differ between patients with a duration of response to first ADT over or under 13 months (P=0.90) but in patients with a TTCRPC of 28 months or more, there was a trend toward longer survival than patients with TTCRPC less than 28 months (5-year overall survival was 74 vs. 50%; P=0.14).

To the authors' knowledge, outcomes for CML diagnosed in these patients have not been well described. The current study was conducted to determine the outcome of patients with CML and a history of prior malignancies.  Methods:   The current study included patients who were enrolled in clinical trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as initial therapy for CML in chronic phase from July 2000 to January 2014.  Results:   Of the 630 patients with CML who were treated with frontline tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 626 had a known prior malignancy status. Of these, 45 patients (7%) had a prior malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer whereas 17 patients (3%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancers alone. Characteristics of CML were similar between the patients with no prior malignancy, those with a prior malignancy, and those with nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients with a prior malignancy were found to have an older median age compared with the other 2 groups. The most common prior malignancies were nonmelanoma skin cancer in 20 patients, breast cancer in 11 patients, melanoma in 7 patients, prostate cancer in 6 patients, and colorectal cancer in 5 patients. With regard to CML, the event-free survival, transformation-free survival, and failure-free survival rates were found to be similar between the groups. There was a statistically significantly decreased survival in the group with a prior malignancy versus the group with no prior malignancy versus the group with nonmelanoma skin cancer. In a multivariate analysis, advanced age and an elevated creatinine level were found to be associated with worse survival after a diagnosis of CML.  Conclusions:   Patients with CML with a history of prior malignancies appear to have the same excellent outcome as patients with no prior malignancies. In the few instances in which concomitant therapy for other malignancies was required during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, this was able to be accomplished without significant toxicity.

Materials and methods:   Data of 22 patients presenting for salvage radiotherapy (RT) with an identified gross tumor volume (GTV) in the prostate bed were analyzed retrospectively. An unsupervised pattern recognition method was used to analyze DCE-MRI curves from the prostate bed. Data were represented as a product of a number of signal-vs.-time patterns and their weights. The temporal pattern, characterized by fast wash-in and gradual wash-out, was considered the ""tumor"" pattern. The corresponding weights were thresholded based on the number (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5) of standard deviations away from the mean, denoted as DCE1.0, …, DCE2.5, and displayed on the T2-weighted MRI. The resultant four volumes were compared with the GTV and maximum pre-RT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Pharmacokinetic modeling was also carried out.  Results:   Principal component analysis determined 2-4 significant patterns in patients' DCE-MRI. Analysis and display of the identified suspicious foci was performed in commercial software (MIM Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA). In general, DCE1.0/DCE1.5 highlighted larger areas than GTV. DCE2.0 and GTV were significantly correlated (r = 0.60, p < 0.05). DCE2.0/DCA2.5 were also significantly correlated with PSA (r = 0.52, 0.67, p < 0.05).

Here, we report the mechanism of action of the natural product 6α-acetoxyanopterine (6-AA) in prostate cancer cells. At low nanomolar doses, this potent cytotoxic alkaloid from the Australian endemic tree Anopterus macleayanus induced a strong accumulation of LNCaP and PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells as well as HeLa (cervical cancer) cells in mitosis, severe mitotic spindle defects, and asymmetric cell divisions, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe accompanied by cell death through apoptosis. DNA microarray of 6-AA-treated LNCaP cells combined with pathway analysis identified very similar transcriptional changes when compared with the anticancer drug vinblastine, which included pathways involved in mitosis, microtubule spindle organization, and microtubule binding. Like vinblastine, 6-AA inhibited microtubule polymerization in a cell-free system and reduced cellular microtubule polymer mass. Yet, microtubule alterations that are associated with resistance to microtubule-destabilizing drugs like vinca alkaloids (vinblastine/vincristine) or 2-methoxyestradiol did not confer resistance to 6-AA, suggesting a different mechanism of microtubule interaction. 6-AA is a first-in-class microtubule inhibitor that features the unique anopterine scaffold. This study provides a strong rationale to further develop this novel structure class of microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of malignant disease.

Here we demonstrate that an expanded p63+ and CK5+ basal/progenitor cell population, induced by the concomitant activation of oncogenic Kras(G12D) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling, underwent cell differentiation in vivo The differentiation process led to suppression of p63-expressing cells with a decreased number of CK5+ basal cells but an increase of CK8+ luminal tumorigenic cells and revealed a hierarchal lineage pattern consisting of p63+/CK5+ progenitor, CK5+/CK8+ transitional progenitor, and CK8+ differentiated luminal cells. Further analysis of the phenotype showed that Kras-AR axis-induced tumorigenesis was mediated by Gli transcription factors. Combined blocking of the activators of this family of proteins (Gli1 and Gli2) inhibited the proliferation of p63+ and CK5+ basal/progenitor cells and development of tumors. Finally, we identified that Gli1 and Gli2 exhibited different functions in the regulation of p63 expression or proliferation of p63+ cells in Kras-AR driven tumors. Gli2, but not Gli1, transcriptionally regulated the expression levels of p63 and prostate sphere formation. Our study provides evidence of a novel mechanism mediating pathological dysregulation of basal/progenitor cells through the differential activation of the Gli transcription factors. Also, these findings define Gli proteins as new downstream mediators of the Kras-AR axis in prostate carcinogenesis and open a potential therapeutic avenue of targeting prostate cancer progression by inhibiting Gli signaling.""","""['Meng Wu', 'Lishann Ingram', 'Ezequiel J Tolosa', 'Renzo E Vera', 'Qianjin Li', 'Sungjin Kim', 'Yongjie Ma', 'Demetri D Spyropoulos', 'Zanna Beharry', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Martin E Fernandez-Zapico', 'Houjian Cai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Loss of the transcription factor GLI1 identifies a signaling network in the tumor microenvironment mediating KRAS oncogene-induced transformation.', 'GLI1 confers profound phenotypic changes upon LNCaP prostate cancer cells that include the acquisition of a hormone independent state.', 'Therapeutic targeting of the Hedgehog-GLI pathway in prostate cancer.', 'p63 in prostate biology and pathology.', 'NEDD9 Overexpression Causes Hyperproliferation of Luminal Cells and Cooperates with HER2 Oncogene in Tumor Initiation: A Novel Prognostic Marker in Breast Cancer.', 'Promotion of Lung Cancer Metastasis by SIRT2-Mediated Extracellular Protein Deacetylation.', 'Structure-based virtual screening identifies an 8-hydroxyquinoline as a small molecule GLI1 inhibitor.', 'The transcription factor GLI1 cooperates with the chromatin remodeler SMARCA2 to regulate chromatin accessibility at distal DNA regulatory elements.', 'Recent insights into the biology of pancreatic cancer.']"""

The study objective was to determine the influence of the geometric distribution of the cores on the detection probability of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The detection probability of significant (>0.5 cm3) and insignificant (<0.2 cm3) tumors was quantified based on a novel 3D capsule model of the biopsy sample. The geometric distribution of the cores was optimized to maximize the probability of detecting significant cancer for various prostate sizes (20-100cm3), number of biopsy cores (6-40 cores) and biopsy core lengths (14-40 mm) for transrectal and transperineal biopsies.  Results:   The detection of significant cancer can be improved by geometric optimization. With the current sextant biopsy, up to 20% of tumors may be missed at biopsy in a 20 cm3 prostate due to the schema. Higher number and longer biopsy cores are required to sample with an equal detection probability in larger prostates. Higher number of cores increases both significant and insignificant tumor detection probability, but predominantly increases the detection of insignificant tumors.

Its poor aqueous solubility and toxicity are the major hindrance for oral drug delivery. The aims of this study are to introduce nanoformulation of flutamide to increase its aqueous solubility thereby improves the therapeutic efficacy of the chemodrug.  Methods:   Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coated flutamide nanoparticles (PVA FLT NPs) were formulated by nanoprecipitation method and characterized by DLS, TEM, FTIR, Drug release profile and biological assays.  Results:   The PVA FLT nanoparticles were about 300nm size and spherical in shape. The PVA coated flutamide nanoparticles were monodispersed and polycrystalline. The FTIR spectra confirmed the encapsulation of flutamide in PVA FLT NPs. The encapsulation efficiency and loading efficiency was found to be about 78% and 15% respectively. The in vitro drug release of nanoparticles was calculated and it showed a sustained release up to 120 hrs at pH 7.4. The in vitro cytotoxicity, colony forming ability and blood compatibility were also investigated. The in vitro cytotoxicity study indicated the dose dependent cytotoxicity of PVA FLT NPs. In vitro clonogenic assay revealed that the PVA FLT NPs treated PC3 cells had less colony forming ability than the untreated PC3 cells.

We present data on same-day discharge (SDD) for patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   Patient data were gathered in an IRB-approved database. In April 2015, the surgeon (S.J.) began SDD. The SDD protocol for RALP includes multimodal anesthesia/analgesia and extended recovery. Interim analysis revealed that government insurance (CMS) refused hospital reimbursement for SDD. As of that time, only patients with commercial insurance were offered SDD. The demographic and peri-operative data were compared between the two cohorts (Group 1, SDD; Group 2, Admitted patients) by using Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared, or fisher exact tests, where appropriate.  Results:   During the study period, 21 patients had undergone RALP. Eleven of 21 patients were offered SDS, and nine (81.8%) were discharged. Both those who elected to stay were successfully discharged on the next day. Patient age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), prostate weight, distance from home to hospital, margin status, marital status, and household income were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The same is true between patients who underwent RALP both before and after initiation of the SDD protocol with the exception of EBL (greater in the SDD group). There have been no reported complications or readmissions for any of the patients in Group 1.  Conclusion:   Our novel pilot study reveals that SDS is safe and feasible. We are currently conducting a further evaluation of patient satisfaction. Future research is needed to verify these conclusions.""","""['Melinda Wolboldt', 'Barbara Saltzman', 'Patrick Tenbrink', 'Khaled Shahrour', 'Samay Jain']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Inguinal Hernia Repair During Extraperitoneal Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Does elevated body mass index (BMI) affect the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP): a prospective cohort study.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Advancements in surgical technique and perioperative care.', 'First Canadian experience with same-day discharge after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Single-night stay for open radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of enhanced recovery after surgery or fast track surgery pathways in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Utilising the prostate cancer detection rates from this study, we investigated the clinical and cost effectiveness of a similar PSA-based screening strategy for an Australian population of men aged 50-69 years.  Methods:   A decision model that incorporated Markov processes was developed from a health system perspective. The base-case scenario compared a population-based screening programme with current opportunistic screening practices. Costs, utility values, treatment patterns and background mortality rates were derived from Australian data. All costs were adjusted to reflect July 2015 Australian dollars (A$). An alternative scenario compared systematic with opportunistic screening but with optimisation of active surveillance (AS) uptake in both groups. A discount rate of 5 % for costs and benefits was utilised. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of variable uncertainty on model outcomes.  Results:   Our model very closely replicated the number of deaths from both prostate cancer and background mortality in the Göteborg study. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for PSA screening was A$147,528. However, for years of life gained (LYGs), PSA-based screening (A$45,890/LYG) appeared more favourable. Our alternative scenario with optimised AS improved cost utility to A$45,881/QALY, with screening becoming cost effective at a 92 % AS uptake rate. Both modelled scenarios were most sensitive to the utility of patients before and after intervention, and the discount rate used.  Conclusion:   PSA-based screening is not cost effective compared with Australia's assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY. It appears more cost effective if LYGs are used as the relevant outcome, and is more cost effective than the established Australian breast cancer screening programme on this basis. Optimised utilisation of AS increases the cost effectiveness of prostate cancer screening dramatically.""","""['Andrew Keller', 'Christian Gericke', 'Jennifer A Whitty', 'John Yaxley', 'Boon Kua', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Troy Gianduzzo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Appl Health Econ Health Policy""","""['Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'Economic Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Selective Treatment Strategies.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Among Chinese Men.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen.', 'China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis.', 'Australian ultrasound-guided biopsy trends: a 17-year analysis of national data.', 'Assessing the value of screening tools: reviewing the challenges and opportunities of cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a systematic review of decision-analytical models.', 'Cost-effectiveness comparison between neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional analysis.']"""

For prostate cancer, identifying clinically relevant molecular subgroups is challenging, as molecular profiling is not routine outside of academic centers. Since histologic variants of other cancers correlates with specific genomic alterations, we sought to determine if ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (dPC) - a rare and aggressive histopathologic variant - was associated with any recurrent actionable mutations. Tumors from 10 consecutive patients with known dPC were sequenced on a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing panel. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 40-73). Four (40%) patients had metastases upon presentation. Archival tissue from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate tissue samples from nine patients and a biopsy of a metastasis from one patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were available for analysis. Nine of 10 samples had sufficient material for tumor sequencing. Four (40%) patients' tumors had a mismatch repair (MMR) gene alteration (N = 2, MSH2; N = 1, MSH6; and N = 1, MLH1), of which 3 (75%) had evidence of hypermutation. Sections of the primary carcinomas of three additional patients with known MMR gene alterations/hypermutation were histologically evaluated; two of these tumors had dPC. MMR mutations associated with hypermutation were common in our cohort of dPC patients. Since hypermutation may predict for response to immune checkpoint blockade, the presence of dPC may be a rapid means to enrich populations for further screening.

It has been shown that AR exert their effects mainly through the androgen-activated AR which binds to androgen response elements (AREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes to regulate the transcription of androgen-responsive genes, thus, identification of AR downstream target gene is critical to understand androgen function in prostate cancer. In this study, our results showed that androgen treatment of LNCaP cells induced PTTG1 expression, which was blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist, Casodex. Bioinformatics analysis and experiments using PTTG1 promoter deletion mutants showed that the PTTG1 promoter contains a putative androgen response element (ARE), which localizes in the -851 to -836 region of the promoter. Androgen activated androgen receptor (AR) binding to this ARE was confirmed by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, Knockdown of PTTG1 expression using short hairpin RNA significantly reduced androgen-induced LNCaP cell growth and invasion. In addition, we showed PTTG1 is highly expressed in metastasis prostate cancer tissue.

Materials and methods:   Men aged 65+ with mCRPC starting first-line or second-line chemotherapy were enrolled in this prospective observational study.

Despite in vitro studies demonstrating this principle, this knowledge has not translated into the use of MMP inhibitors (MMPi) as effective cancer therapeutics, or been corroborated by evidence of in vivo ECM degradation mediated by MT1-MMP, suggesting that our understanding of the role of MT1-MMP in cancer progression is incomplete.  Methods:   MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines were created that stably overexpress different levels of MT1-MMP. Using 2D culture, we analyzed proMMP-2 activation (gelatin zymography), ECM degradation (fluorescent gelatin), ERK signaling (immunoblot), cell migration (transwell/scratch closure/time-lapse imaging), and viability (colorimetric substrate) to assess how different MT1-MMP levels affect these cellular parameters. We also utilized Matrigel 3D cell culture and avian embryos to examine how different levels of MT1-MMP expression affect morphological changes in 3D culture, and tumourigenecity and extravasation efficiency in vivo.  Results:   In 2D culture, breast cancer cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP were capable of widespread ECM degradation and TIMP-2-mediated proMMP-2 activation, but were not the most migratory. Instead, cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP were the most migratory, and demonstrated increased viability and ERK activation. In 3D culture, MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated an invasive protrusive phenotype, whereas cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated loss of colony structure and cell fragment release. Similarly, in vivo analysis demonstrated increased tumourigenecity and metastatic capability for cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP, whereas cells expressing high levels were devoid of these qualities despite the production of functional MT1-MMP protein.

We investigated whether and how estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRα) is involved in bone tumor progression associated with advanced prostate cancer. By meta-analysis, we first found that ERRα expression is correlated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the hallmark of progressive disease. We then analyzed tumor cell progression and the associated signaling pathways in gain-of-function/loss-of-function CRPC models in vivo and in vitro. Increased levels of ERRα in tumor cells led to rapid tumor progression, with both bone destruction and formation, and direct impacts on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. VEGF-A, WNT5A and TGFβ1 were upregulated by ERRα in tumor cells and all of these factors also significantly and positively correlated withERRα expression in CRPC patient specimens.

To evaluate the extent of NED in patients with CRPC, we used PET/CT with Ga-[DOTA-Tyr]-octreotate (Ga-DOTA-TATE), a somatostatin analog that binds somatostatin receptor 2 with high affinity. This radiotracer is used in imaging of neuroendocrine tumors.  Methods:   Twelve patients (mean age, 65 [SD, 12] years) with CRPC were studied. Their mean prostate-specific antigen level at scanning was 85.6 (SD, 144.6) ng/mL. PET/CT images were obtained after the injection of 120 to 200 MBq of Ga-DOTA-TATE.  Results:   All participants had at least 1 blastic metastasis demonstrating uptake of Ga-DOTA-TATE (mean SUVmax of 5.3 [SD, 2.3]). In 6 patients, moderately high to high uptakes (SUVmax, >5) were seen. Patients with multiple bone metastases had a significantly higher SUVmax compared with patients with few metastases (mean of 5.8 vs 3.8, P = 0.05). In 4 patients, lytic bone lesions or lymph node metastases also showed uptake of the tracer (mean SUVmax of 7.2 [SD, 3.2]). Uptake of the radiotracer was also observed in bones showing normal architecture in CT, suggesting that NED cells appear early during metastases development.  Conclusions:   Uptake of Ga-DOTA-TATE is a common finding in metastases of CRPC patients, suggesting that NED is frequent in these patients. In half of the patients, widespread uptake of Ga-DOTA-TATE was observed. This suggests that the possibility of treating selected CRCP patients with anti-neuroendocrine tumor therapies should be explored and that Ga-DOTA-TATE scanning could have a role in predicting the efficacy of these treatments.""","""['Ofer Nathan Gofrit', 'Stephen Frank', 'Amichay Meirovitz', 'Hovav Nechushtan', 'Marina Orevi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['Biodistribution and first clinical results of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE PET: a novel 18F-labeled somatostatin analog for imaging of neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Comparison of Ga-68 DOTA-TATE and Ga-68 DOTA-LAN PET/CT imaging in the same patient group with neuroendocrine tumours: preliminary results.', 'A prospective head-to-head comparison of 68\xa0Ga-NOTA-3P-TATE-RGD and 68\xa0Ga-DOTATATE in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.

Methods:   Whole-body planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT of the lower abdominal pelvic region of 60 patients with biochemical relapse of PC were analyzed retrospectively. In these subjects, an average dose of 733.1 ± 49.5 MBq (19.8 ± 1.3 mCi) Tc-labeled MIP-1404 was injected 4 to 5 hours prior to imaging. In addition to visual evaluation, SUVmax were determined in the tumor lesions using a previously developed protocol for quantitative SPECT/CT.  Results:   In 42 of 60 patients, Tc-MIP-1404-positive lesions could be detected (70%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.82). Twenty patients had Tc-MIP-1404-positive lymph nodes suggestive of metastasis, 14 patients had pathological uptake in the prostate region indicative of local recurrence, and for another 19 patients, there was tracer accumulation in the skeleton (n = 18) or lungs (n = 1). Detection rate was 91.4% (95% CI, 0.82-1) at prostate-specific antigen levels greater than 2 ng/mL and 40.0% (95% CI, 0.21-0.59) at lower prostate-specific antigen values (P < 0.01).

Secondary bladder neoplasms need to be recognized as this impacts patient management. We report our experience on nonurothelial malignancies (NUM) detected in urine cytology over a 10-year period.  Methods:   A 10-year retrospective search for patients with biopsy-proven NUM to the urothelial tract yielded 25 urine samples from 14 patients. Two cytopathologists blinded to the original cytology diagnosis reviewed the cytology and histology slides. The incidence, cytomorphologic features, diagnostic accuracy, factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy, and clinical impact of the cytology result were studied.  Results:   The incidence of NUM was <1%. The male:female ratio was 1.3. An abnormality was detected in 60% of the cases; however, in only 4% of the cases, a primary site was identified accurately. Of the false negatives, 96% was deemed as sampling errors and 4% was interpretational. Patient management was not impacted in any of the false-negative cases due to concurrent or past tissue diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Colon cancer was the most frequent secondary tumor. Sampling error attributed to the false-negative results. Necrosis and dirty background was often associated with metastatic lesions from colon. Obtaining history of a primary tumor elsewhere was a key factor in diagnosis of a metastatic lesion. Hematopoietic malignancies remain to be a diagnostic challenge. Cytospin preparations were superior for evaluating nuclear detail and background material as opposed to monolayer (Thinprep) technology. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by obtaining immunohistochemistry. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Diagn.

We tested the relationship between circulating tT and grade group 5 (G5) PCa at radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with preoperative low- to intermediate-risk disease.  Methods:   Serum sex hormones were assessed the day before RP in a cohort of 846 patients with low- to intermediate-risk PCa. Patients were segregated using the new 5-tiered Gleason grade groups. Restricted cubic spline functions and logistic regression analyses tested the association between sex hormones and G5 PCa. Differences in potential predictive accuracy (PA) were assessed for tT and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   Overall, 27 men (3.2%) had G5 PCa at RP, and this group had higher PSA values than patients with G1-G4 PCa (P = 0.02). The groups did not differ in terms of preoperative mean hormonal values. Both low and high circulating tT values depicted a nonlinear U-shaped correlation with G5 PCa at RP. The lowest and highest (10th and 90th percentiles) tT values and biopsy PCa grade emerged as multivariable independent predictors of G5 PCa at RP (all P < 0.05). PA for G5 PCa did not differ between tT (area under the curve [AUC] 0.631) and PSA (AUC 0.636).  Conclusions:   Circulating tT was a significant predictor of G5 PCa at RP in patients with preoperative low- to intermediate-risk disease. Preoperative tT and PSA values showed similar PA for the most aggressive disease, confirming a potential role for circulating androgens in preoperative risk assessment of PCa patients.

Moreover, the roles of body mass index (BMI) and race in risk of recurrence are controversial [1,2]. To address these issues, we developed and cross-validated RAPS (Risks After Prostate Surgery), a personal prediction model for biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 10 years of radical prostatectomy (RP) that includes BMI and race as possible predictors, and recurrence-free death as a competing risk.  Methods:   RAPS uses a patient's risk factors at surgery to assign him a recurrence probability based on statistical learning methods applied to a cohort of 1,276 patients undergoing RP at the University of Pennsylvania. We compared the performance of RAPS to that of an existing model with respect to calibration (by comparing observed and predicted outcomes), and discrimination (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)).  Results:   RAPS' cross-validated BCR predictions provided better calibration than those of an existing model that underestimated patients' risks. Discrimination was similar for the two models, with BCR AUCs of 0.793, 95% confidence interval (0.766-0.820) for RAPS, and 0.780 (0.745-0.815) for the existing model. RAPS' most important BCR predictors were tumor grade, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and BMI; race was less important [3]. RAPS' predictions can be obtained online at https://predict.shinyapps.io/raps.  Conclusion:   RAPS' cross-validated BCR predictions were better calibrated than those of an existing model, and BMI information contributed substantially to these predictions. RAPS predictions for recurrence-free death were limited by lack of co-morbidity data; however the model provides a simple framework for extension to include such data. Its use and extension should facilitate decision strategies for post-RP prostate cancer management.

However, the anti-tumor effect of LASP1 knockdown and the association between LASP1 and the androgen receptor (AR) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the significance of LASP1 as a target for prostate cancer, and to test the effect of silencing LASP1 in vivo using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO).  Methods:   A tissue microarray (TMA) was performed to characterize the differences in LASP1 expression in prostate cancer treated after hormone deprivation therapy. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle. We designed LASP1 ASO for knockdown of LASP1 in vivo studies.  Results:   The expression of LASP1 in TMA was increased after androgen ablation and persisted in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Also in TMA, compared with LNCaP cell, LASP1 expression is elevated in CRPC cell lines (C4-2 and VehA cells). Interestingly, suppression of AR elevated LASP1 expression conversely, AR activation decreased LASP1 expression. Silencing of LASP1 reduced cell growth through G1 arrest which was accompanied by a decrease of cyclin D1. Forced overexpression of LASP1 promoted cell cycle and induced cell growth which was accompanied by an increase of cyclin D1. Systemic administration of LASP1 ASO with athymic mice significantly inhibited tumor growth in CRPC xenografts.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that LASP1 is negatively regulated by AR at the transcriptional level and promotes tumor growth through induction of cell cycle, ultimately suggesting that LASP1 may be a potential target in prostate cancer treatment.

We analyzed overall survival and progression-free survival, depending on the number and location of metastases on patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. Other potential prognostic factors were also evaluated: age, clinical stage, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason, PSA nadir, time till PSA nadir and first-line or second-line treatment after progression.  Results:   We analyzed a series of 162 patients. The mean age was 72.7yr (SD: 8.5). The estimated median overall survival was 3.9 yr (95% CI 2.6-5.2). The overall survival in patients with only lymph node metastases was 7 yr (95% CI 4.1-9.7), 3.9 (95%CI 2.3-5.5) in patients with only bone metastases, 2.5 yr (95% CI 2-2.3) in lymph nodes and bone metastases, and 2.2 yr (95% CI 1.4-3) in patients with visceral metastases (P<.001). In multivariate analysis, the location of metastasesis significantly associated with overall survival and progression-free survival. The number of metastases showed no association with survival.

Current silicon and polymer based CSs require extensive work in professional cleanroom for the fabrication of either the silicon device itself or the micromold for polymer processing. In this work, we fabricated a PEG-based CS in a one-step photopolymerization process without the requirement of any cleanroom work. Water, buffer and serum can flow autonomously in this CS and the liquid flow rate can be tuned by modification with surfactant solution of different concentrations. We further integrated an antibody-coated microbead array into this CS for the autonomous immunoassay of two tumor markers, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in serum samples with a total assay time of less than 10min. The detection limits for the two tumor markers were at sub-nanogram per milliliter range which is lower than their clinical threshold concentrations for cancer diagnosis. Moreover, simultaneous and multiplex detection of the two tumor markers was also achieved by using spatially encoded microbeads.

However, the clinicopathological and prognostic characteristics of early-onset Chinese prostate cancer patients have not yet been assessed. This study aimed to examine the clinicopathological and prognostic factors of prostate cancer patients aged ≤55 years in a single Chinese center. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred six prostate cancer patients aged ≤55 years with complete clinicopathological data who were treated at our hospital between January 2000 and June 2014 were selected for this study. Survival rate was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and prognostic factors were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The median time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 3.5 months (range, 2-55 months). The median time after endocrine therapy to development of androgen-independent prostate cancer was 10.5 months. A total of 54 patients died (50.9%), of whom 96.2% died from prostate cancer. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 88.7%, 66.2%, and 36.0%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that T staging, visceral metastasis, pathological pattern, and Gleason sum were independent prognostic factors in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Prostate cancer patients aged ≤55 years are often omitted or misdiagnosed in China. Furthermore, the pathology patterns in this age group were mostly complicated with a high degree of malignancy. Late staging, visceral metastasis, pathological pattern, and high Gleason score were independent prognostic factors in these patients. Comprehensive therapy combined with local therapy is an effective treatment strategy.""","""['Yan Xu', 'Xueling Yang', 'Tongguo Si', 'Haipeng Yu', 'Weihao Zhang', 'Yong Li', 'Zhi Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Differential Risk of Castration Resistance After Initial Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical and oncologic findings of extraprostatic extension on needle biopsy in de novo metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The oncological outcomes and risk stratification in docetaxel chemotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of circulating tumor cell enumeration and tumor marker detection in predicting prognosis and treatment effect in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Raloxifene, a selective ER modulator, has inhibited the growth of prostate cancer xenograft models and was tested in a phase II trial of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), with some patients achieving stable disease. However, no studies have examined the safety of the combination of bicalutamide plus raloxifene for CRPC. Therefore, we investigated the safety of treatment with bicalutamide plus raloxifene in patients with CRPC in an initial study.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a study to evaluate the toxicity (primary endpoint) of the combination of bicalutamide (50 mg) and raloxifene (60 mg) in 28-day cycles (maximum, 6 cycles) in men with progressive CRPC. The secondary endpoint, quality of life (QOL), was assessed by patients using a 6-item linear analog self-assessment or hormonal domain scale of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.  Results:   We enrolled 18 patients with CRPC in the study to evaluate the safety of, and patient assessment of QOL (mental, physical, social, emotional, and spiritual) with, bicalutamide plus raloxifene therapy. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred. None of the 18 patients required dose reductions. The patient assessment of QOL showed no statistically significant changes after 2 treatment cycles. The median progression-free survival with bicalutamide plus raloxifene was 1.9 months (95% confidence interval, 1.8-2.8 months).  Conclusion:   The results of the present study have shown that bicalutamide/raloxifene treatment is well tolerated.

We aimed to explore its functional significance in prostate tumor initiation and its link to androgen receptor (AR) signaling. For this purpose, we generated a new cell line derived from normal epithelial prostate cells (RWPE-1) with overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and used it for in vitro and in vivo experiments. We then comprehensively analyzed the expression of the main metabolic enzymes of the polyamine pathway and spermine abundance in 120 well-characterized cases of human prostate cancer and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Herein, we show that the ODC-overexpressing prostate cells underwent malignant transformation, revealing that ODC is sufficient for de novo tumor initiation in 94% of injected mice. This oncogenic capacity was acquired through alteration of critical signaling networks, including AR, EIF2, and mTOR/MAPK. RNA silencing experiments revealed the link between AR signaling and polyamine metabolism. Human prostate cancers consistently demonstrated up-regulation of the main polyamine enzymes analyzed (ODC, polyamine oxidase, and spermine synthase) and reduction of spermine. This phenotype was also dominant in HGPIN, rendering it a new biomarker of malignant transformation. In summary, we report that ODC plays a key role in prostate tumorigenesis and that the polyamine pathway is altered as early as HGPIN.""","""['Amita Shukla-Dave', 'Mireia Castillo-Martin', 'Ming Chen', 'Jose Lobo', 'Nataliya Gladoun', 'Ana Collazo-Lorduy', 'Faisal M Khan', 'Vladimir Ponomarev', 'Zhengzi Yi', 'Weijia Zhang', 'Pier P Pandolfi', 'Hedvig Hricak', 'Carlos Cordon-Cardo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Activation of polyamine catabolic enzymes involved in diverse responses against epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) expression pattern in human prostate tissues and ODC transgenic mice.', 'Role of ornithine decarboxylase in regulation of estrogen receptor alpha expression and growth in human breast cancer cells.', 'Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase during oncogenic transformation: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.', 'Catabolism of polyamines.', 'Quantitative Metabolomics to Explore the Role of Plasma Polyamines in Colorectal Cancer.', 'One-Carbon and Polyamine Metabolism as Cancer Therapy Targets.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.']"""

In a nested case-control study within the PLCO Screening Trial we measured serum levels of 64 inflammation-related biomarkers in 284 incident endometrial cancer cases and 284 matched controls. Using multivariable logistic regression inflammation markers were evaluated individually and combined into a cross-validated inflammation score. Of 64 markers, 22 were associated with endometrial cancer risk at p < 0.05 and 17 of 22 markers remained associated after multiple testing corrections. After adjusting for BMI and estradiol, SERPINE1 [quartile(Q)4 vs. Q1 odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)), p trend = 2.43 (0.94-6.29), 0.03] and VEGFA [2.56 (1.52-4.30), 0.0002] were positively associated with endometrial cancer risk, while CCL3 [0.46 (0.27-0.77), 0.01], IL13 [0.55 (0.33-0.93), 0.01], IL21 [0.52 (0.31-0.87), 0.01], IL1B [0.51 (0.30-0.86), 0.01] and IL23 [0.60 (0.35-1.03), 0.02] were inversely associated with risk.

Methods:   Clinical data from 57 patients who received 2.5-5.1 GBq of 186Re-HEDP as part of NIH-funded phase I/II clinical trials were analysed. Whole-body and SPECT-based absorbed doses to the whole body and bone lesions were calculated for 22 patients receiving 5 GBq. The patient mean absorbed dose was defined as the mean of all bone lesion-absorbed doses in any given patient. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, Cox's proportional hazards model and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used for overall survival (OS) and correlation analyses.  Results:   A statistically significantly longer OS was associated with administered activities above 3.5 GBq in the 57 patients (20.1 vs 7.1 months, hazard ratio: 0.39, 95 % CI: 0.10-0.58, P = 0.002). A total of 379 bone lesions were identified in 22 patients. The mean of the patient mean absorbed dose was 19 (±6) Gy and the mean of the whole-body absorbed dose was 0.33 (±0.11) Gy for the 22 patients. The patient mean absorbed dose (r = 0.65, P = 0.001) and the whole-body absorbed dose (r = 0.63, P = 0.002) showed a positive correlation with disease volume.

Current statistical models to identify differentially expressed genes between disease and control groups often overlook the substantial human sample heterogeneity. Meanwhile, traditional nonparametric tests lose detailed data information and sacrifice the analysis power, although they are distribution free and robust to heterogeneity. Here, we propose an empirical likelihood ratio test with a mean-variance relationship constraint (ELTSeq) for the differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). As a distribution-free nonparametric model, ELTSeq handles individual heterogeneity by estimating an empirical probability for each observation without making any assumption about read-count distribution. It also incorporates a constraint for the read-count overdispersion, which is widely observed in RNA-seq data. ELTSeq demonstrates a significant improvement over existing methods such as edgeR, DESeq, t-tests, Wilcoxon tests and the classic empirical likelihood-ratio test when handling heterogeneous groups.

Beyond the involvement of the healthcare professional, patient involvement and empowerment could play a major role in that setting. We explored how patients perceived and fulfilled that role during their radiation treatment.  Materials and methods:   A voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was administered to all patients treated in our department between November 2013 and May 2014. The following data were collected: sociodemographic profile; information received and initiatives to search for additional information; behavior when an unusual treatment event was perceived; active involvement in the safety of the treatment; nature and perception of their own involvement. A statistical analysis was performed to assess behavioral predictors.  Results:   A total of 155 patients answered the survey. Most of them were treated for prostate (n=58, 37.4%), lung (n=27, 17.4%), head and neck (n=26, 16.8%) and breast (n=25, 16.1%). Only eight patients (5%) had previously received radiation therapy. Ninety-five percent of the patients estimated they had received enough information about their treatment, but 48% would have wanted more. When patients noticed an unusual event during their treatment session, most of them (61%) reported it to the radiation therapist.  Conclusion:   Patient participation to radiation therapy safety should be encouraged to ensure a cooperative risk management.

A förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor was established by attaching nile red (NR) to graphene quantum dots (GQDs) via lecithin/β-Cyclodextrin (lecithin/β-CD) complex as the linker. The introduction of lecithin/β-CD would brought GQDs-NR pair close enough through both electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction, thereby making the FRET occur and thus resulting in the fluorescence quenching of GQDs (donor) and meanwhile the fluorescence enhancement of NR (acceptor).

Due to the lack of knowledge on the etiological factors for PCa, studies that are both hypothesis-generating and confirmatory are still needed. This study explores relationships between employment, by occupation and industry, and PCa risk.  Methods:   Cases were 1937 men aged ≤75 years with incident PCa diagnosed across Montreal French hospitals in 2005-2009. Controls were 1994 men recruited concurrently from electoral lists of French-speaking Montreal residents, frequency-matched to cases by age. In-person interviews elicited occupational histories. Unconditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association between employment across 696 occupations and 613 industries and PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders. Multinomial logistic models assessed risks by PCa grade. Semi-Bayes (SB) adjustment accounted for the large number of associations evaluated.  Results:   Consistently positive associations-and generally robust to SB adjustment-were found for occupations in forestry and logging (OR 1.9, 95 % CI: 1.2-3.0), social sciences (OR 1.6, 95 % CI: 1.1-2.2) and for police officers and detectives (OR: 1.8, 95 % CI 1.1-2.9). Occupations where elevated risk of high grade PCa was found included gasoline station attendants (OR 4.3, 95 % CI 1.8-10.4) and textile processing occupations (OR 1.8, 95 % CI 1.1-3.2). Aside from logging, industries with elevated PCa risk included provincial government and financial institutions. Occupations with reduced risk included farmers (OR 0.6, 95 % CI 0.4-1.0) and aircraft maintenance workers (OR 0.1, 95 % CI 0.0-0.7).

We also sought to determine how patients rated the efficacy of these modalities compared with conventional treatment.  Methods:   A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted using an interviewer-administered pilot-tested de novo questionnaire during the period June to August 2012 at two speciality treatment centres on the island. Data was analysed using χ2 analyses.  Results:   Among the 150 patients who reported use of herbal remedies/functional foods, soursop (Annona muricata L.) was the most popular; with 80.7 % using the leaves, bark, fruit and seeds on a regular basis. Other common herbal remedies/functional foods included wheatgrass (Triticum aestivum L.), saffron (Crocus sativus L.) and Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. The most commonly used functional foods were beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.), carrots (Daucus carata L.) and papaya (Carica papaya L.) used by 43.3 % of patients; and these were mostly blended as a mixture. Herbal remedies and functional foods were used on a daily basis and patients believed that this modality was equally (32.0 %) or more efficacious (14.7 %) than conventional treatment.

Despite the fact that novel blood and urine tests are available which may predict aggressive disease better than PSA, they are not routinely employed due to a lack of clinical validity studies. Furthermore approximately 40 % of mp-MRI studies are reported as indeterminate, which can lead to repeat examinations or unnecessary biopsy with associated patient anxiety, discomfort, risk and additional costs.  Methods/design:   We aim to clinically validate a panel of minimally invasive promising blood and urine biomarkers, to better select patients that will benefit from a multiparametric prostate MRI. We will then test whether the performance of the mp-MRI can be improved by the addition of an advanced diffusion-weighted MRI technique, which uses a biophysical model to characterise tissue microstructure called VERDICT; Vascular and Extracellular Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours. INNOVATE is a prospective single centre cohort study in 365 patients. mp-MRI will act as the reference standard for the biomarker panel. A clinical outcome based reference standard based on biopsy, mp-MRI and follow-up will be used for VERDICT MRI.  Discussion:   We expect the combined effect of biomarkers and VERDICT MRI will improve care by better detecting aggressive prostate cancer early and make mp-MRI before biopsy economically viable for universal NHS adoption.

However, despite promise, single-agent inhibitors targeting the two pathways have not shown long-term benefits, perhaps due to a complex compensatory cross talk that exists between the two pathways. Combination therapy has thus been proposed to maximize benefit. We have carried out a systematic study of two-drug combination effect of MDV3100 (AR antagonist), BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor), TKI258 (pan RTK inhibitor) and RAD001 (mTOR inhibitor) using various PCa cell lines. We observed strong synergy when AR-positive cells are treated with MDV3100 in combination with any one of the PI3K-pathway inhibitors: TKI258, BKM120, or RAD001. Growth curve based synergy determination combined with Western blot analysis suggested MDV3100+BKM120 to be the most effective in inducing cell death in such conditions. In the case of dual targeting of the PI3K-pathway BKM120+TKI258 combination displayed exquisite sensitivity in all the 5 cell lines tested irrespective of androgen sensitivity, (LNCaP, VCaP, 22Rv1, PC3 and Du145). The effect of blockade with BKM120+TKI258 in PC3 cells was similar to a combination of BKM120 with chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel.Taken together, our observation supports earlier observations that a combination of AR-inhibitor and PI3K-inhibitor is highly synergistic. Furthermore, combining BKM120 with TKI258 has better synergy than BKM120+RAD001 or RAD001+TKI258 in all the lines, irrespective of androgen sensitivity. Finally, BKM120 also displayed synergy when combined with chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel.

However, mechanisms that differentiate the function of oncogenic ETS factors expressed in prostate tumors from non-oncogenic ETS factors expressed in normal prostate are unknown. Here, we find that four oncogenic ETS (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5), and no other ETS, interact with the Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint protein, EWS. This EWS interaction was necessary and sufficient for oncogenic ETS functions including gene activation, cell migration, clonogenic survival, and transformation. Significantly, the EWS interacting region of ERG has no homology with that of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Therefore, this finding may explain how divergent ETS factors have a common oncogenic function. Strikingly, EWS is fused to various ETS factors by the chromosome translocations that cause Ewing's sarcoma.

Diagnostic performance for GS ≥7 tumor was assessed by using MR imaging-ultrasonography fusion-targeted biopsy as the reference. The impact of existing PI-RADS V2 decision rules, as well as a series of exploratory proposed adjustments, on the frequency of GS ≥7 tumor detection, was evaluated. Results A total of 210 lesions were benign, 43 were GS 6, and 90 were GS ≥7.

There are no existing therapies that specifically target the OB phase that affects 90% of men with bone metastatic disease. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is secreted by PCa cells in OB metastases and increases OB growth, differentiation, and bone mineralization. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PAP effects on OB bone metastases are mediated by autocrine and/or paracrine alterations in the receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system. To investigate whether PAP modulated these factors and altered the bone reaction, we knocked down PAP expression in VCaP cells and stably overexpressed PAP in PC3M cells, both derived from human PCa bone metastases. We show that knockdown of PAP in VCaP cells decreased OPG while increasing RANK/RANKL expression. Forced overexpression of PAP in PC3M cells had the inverse effect, increasing OPG while decreasing RANK/RANKL expression. Coculture of PCa cells with MC3T3 preosteoblasts also revealed a role for secretory PAP in OB-PCa cross talk. Reduced PAP expression in VCaP cells decreased MC3T3 proliferation and differentiation and reduced their OPG expression. PAP overexpression in PC3M cells altered the bone phenotype creating OB rather than osteolytic lesions in vivo using an intratibial model. These findings demonstrate that PAP secreted by PCa cells in OB bone metastases increases OPG and plays a critical role in the vicious cross talk between cancer and bone cells. These data suggest that inhibition of secretory PAP may be an effective strategy for PCa OB bone lesions.""","""['Alexander Kirschenbaum', 'Sudeh Izadmehr', 'Shen Yao', ""Kieley L O'Connor-Chapman"", 'Alan Huang', 'Elias M Gregoriades', 'Shoshana Yakar', 'Alice C Levine']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Induction of retinol-binding protein 4 and placenta-specific 8 expression in human prostate cancer cells remaining in bone following osteolytic tumor growth inhibition by osteoprotegerin.', 'RANKL/RANK/OPG system beyond bone remodeling: involvement in breast cancer and clinical perspectives.', 'The RANK/RANKL/OPG triad in cancer-induced bone diseases.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Graphene quantum dots: synthesis, properties, and applications to the development of optical and electrochemical sensors for chemical sensing.', 'Nanoproteomic Approach for Isolation and Identification of Potential Biomarkers in Human Urine from Adults with Normal Weight, Overweight and Obesity.', 'Applications of Graphene Quantum Dots in Biomedical Sensors.', 'Mechanisms of Osteoblastic Bone Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: Role of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between January 2012 and December 2014, 456 patients with biopsy-proven cancer underwent multiparametric 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI sequences, and then radical prostatectomy. Two radiologists independently reviewed MR images using PI-RADSv2. For AS, PRIAS required clinical stage <T3, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.2 ng/mL2 , Gleason score (GS) ≤6, and the number of positive cores ≤2. For AS, PI-RADSv2 required an index lesion scored <4. Standard reference was prostatectomy, in which insignificant cancer was defined as a small (<0.5 cm3 ) organ-confined lesion with GS ≤6. Sensitivity and specificity for insignificant cancer were obtained with PRIAS, PI-RADSv2, and both.  Results:   The sensitivity and specificity with PRIAS were 82.9% (68/82) and 70.9% (265/374), respectively. PI-RADSv2 decreased the sensitivity to 61% (50/82) to 80.5% (66/82), but increased the specificity to 77.8% (291/374) to 90.8% (340/374).

The study focuses the peripheral zone because 75% of prostate cancers start within this region and the majority of prostate cancers arising within this region are more aggressive than those arising in the transitional zone.  Methods:   For the model development, square patches were extracted at random locations from malignant and benign regions. Subsequently, extracted patches were aggregated and clustered using k-means clustering to generate textons that represent both regions. All textons together form a texton dictionary, which was used to construct a texton map for every peripheral zone in the training images. Based on the texton map, histogram models for each malignant and benign tissue samples were constructed and used as a feature vector to train our classifiers. In the testing phase, four machine learning algorithms were employed to classify each unknown sample tissue based on its corresponding feature vector.  Results:   The proposed method was tested on 418 T2-W MR images taken from 45 patients. Evaluation results show that the best three classifiers were Bayesian network (Az = 92.8% ± 5.9%), random forest (89.5% ± 7.1%), and k-NN (86.9% ± 7.5%). These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art in the literature.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a prostate computer aided diagnosis method based on textons using a single modality of T2-W MRI without the need for the typical feature extraction methods, such as filtering and convolution.

The aim of this studying is to develop a novel method for automatic, multiorgan segmentation of the male pelvis.  Methods:   The authors' segmentation method consists of several stages. First, a pretreatment includes parameterization, principal component analysis (PCA), and an established process of region-specific hierarchical appearance cluster (RSHAC) model which was executed on the training dataset. After the preprocessing, online automatic segmentation of new CT images is achieved by combining the RSHAC model with the PCA-based point distribution model. Fifty pelvic CT from eight prostate cancer patients were used as the training dataset. From another 20 prostate cancer patients, 210 CT images were used for independent validation of the segmentation method.  Results:   In the training dataset, 15 PCA modes were needed to represent 95% of shape variations of pelvic organs. When tested on the validation dataset, the authors' segmentation method had an average Dice similarity coefficient and mean absolute distance of 0.751 and 0.371 cm, 0.783 and 0.303 cm, 0.573 and 0.604 cm for prostate, bladder, and rectum, respectively. The automated segmentation process took on average 5 min on a personal computer equipped with Core 2 Duo CPU of 2.8 GHz and 8 GB RAM.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed an efficient and reliable method for automatic segmentation of multiple organs in the male pelvis. This method should be useful for treatment planning and adaptive replanning for prostate cancer radiotherapy.

The possibility of improving the quality of treatment plans by an optimized selection of the beam angle incidences-beam angle optimization (BAO)-is seldom done in clinical practice. The inclusion of noncoplanar beam incidences in an automated optimization routine is even more unusual. However, for some tumor sites, the advantage of considering noncoplanar beam incidences is well known. This paper presents the benefits of using a derivative-free multistart framework for the optimization of the noncoplanar BAO problem.  Methods:   Multistart methods combine a global strategy for sampling the search space with a local strategy for improving the sampled solutions. The proposed global strategy allows a thorough exploration of the continuous search space of the highly nonconvex BAO problem. To avoid local entrapment, a derivative-free method is used as local procedure. Additional advantages of the derivative-free method include the reduced number of function evaluations required to converge and the ability to use multithreaded computing. Twenty nasopharyngeal clinical cases were selected to test the proposed multistart framework. The planning target volumes included the primary tumor, the high and low risk lymph nodes. Organs-at-risk included the spinal cord, brainstem, optical nerves, chiasm, parotids, oral cavity, brain, thyroid, among others. For each case, a setup with seven equispaced beams was chosen and the resulting treatment plan, using a multicriteria optimization framework, was then compared against the coplanar and noncoplanar plans using the optimal beam setups obtained by the derivative-free multistart framework.  Results:   The optimal noncoplanar beam setup obtained by the derivative-free multistart framework leads to high quality treatment plans with better target coverage and with improved organ sparing compared to treatment plans using equispaced or optimal coplanar beam angle setups. The noncoplanar treatment plans achieved, e.g., an average reduction in the mean dose of the oral cavity of 6.1 Gy and an average reduction in the maximum-dose of the brainstem of 7 Gy when compared to the equispaced treatment plans.  Conclusions:   The noncoplanar BAO problem is an extremely challenging multimodal optimization problem that can be successfully addressed through a thoughtful exploration of the continuous highly nonconvex BAO search space. The proposed framework is capable of calculating high quality treatment plans and thus can be an interesting alternative toward automated noncoplanar beam selection in IMRT treatment planning which is nowadays the natural trend in treatment planning.""","""['Humberto Rocha', 'Joana Dias', 'Tiago Ventura', 'Brígida Ferreira', 'Maria do Carmo Lopes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Noncoplanar VMAT for nasopharyngeal tumors: Plan quality versus treatment time.', 'Automated generation of IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients with metal hip prostheses: comparison of different planning strategies.', 'Development of methods for beam angle optimization for IMRT using an accelerated exhaustive search strategy.', 'iCycle: Integrated, multicriterial beam angle, and profile optimization for generation of coplanar and noncoplanar IMRT plans.', 'Robust Angle Selection in Particle Therapy.', 'Comparison of non-coplanar optimization of static beams and arc trajectories for intensity-modulated treatments of meningioma cases.']"""

However, MR-based localization of needles (including catheters or tubes) has inherently a low update rate and the required image interpretation can be hampered by signal voids arising from blood vessels or calcifications limiting the precision of the needle guidance and reconstruction. In this paper, a new needle tracking prototype is investigated using fiber Bragg gratings (FBG)-based sensing: this prototype involves a MR-compatible stylet composed of three optic fibers with nine sets of embedded FBG sensors each. This stylet can be inserted into brachytherapy needles and allows a fast measurement of the needle deflection. This study aims to assess the potential of FBG-based sensing for real-time needle (including catheter or tube) tracking during MR-guided intervention.  Methods:   First, the MR compatibility of FBG-based sensing and its accuracy was evaluated. Different known needle deflections were measured using FBG-based sensing during simultaneous MR-imaging. Then, a needle tracking procedure using FBG-based sensing was proposed. This procedure involved a MR-based calibration of the FBG-based system performed prior to the interventional procedure. The needle tracking system was assessed in an experiment with a moving phantom during MR imaging. The FBG-based system was quantified by comparing the gold-standard shapes, the shape manually segmented on MRI and the FBG-based measurements.  Results:   The evaluation of the MR compatibility of FBG-based sensing and its accuracy shows that the needle deflection could be measured with an accuracy of 0.27 mm on average. Besides, the FBG-based measurements were comparable to the uncertainty of MR-based measurements estimated at half the voxel size in the MR image. Finally, the mean(standard deviation) Euclidean distance between MR- and FBG-based needle position measurements was equal to 0.79 mm(0.37 mm). The update rate and latency of the FBG-based needle position measurement were 100 and 300 ms, respectively.  Conclusions:   The FBG-based needle tracking procedure proposed in this paper is able to determine the position of the complete needle, under MR-imaging, with better accuracy and precision, higher update rate, and lower latency compared to current MR-based needle localization methods. This system would be eligible for MR-guided brachytherapy, in particular, for an improved needle guidance and reconstruction.""","""['Maxence Borot de Battisti', 'Baudouin Denis de Senneville', 'Metha Maenhout', 'Jan J W Lagendijk', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Gilion Hautvast', 'Dirk Binnekamp', 'Marinus A Moerland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of an active magnetic resonance tracking system for interstitial brachytherapy.', 'A novel adaptive needle insertion sequencing for robotic, single needle MR-guided high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Simultaneous automatic segmentation of multiple needles using 3D ultrasound for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Review of strategies for MRI based reconstruction of endocavitary and interstitial applicators in brachytherapy of cervical cancer.', 'Data-driven adaptive needle insertion assist for transperineal prostate interventions.', 'Axially rigid steerable needle with compliant active tip control.', 'Design and analysis of a fiber-optic sensing system for shape reconstruction of a minimally invasive surgical needle.', 'Shape accuracy of fiber optic sensing for medical devices characterized in bench experiments.', 'Navigation and visualisation with HoloLens in endovascular aortic repair.']"""

A deformable image registration (DIR)-based method and a scatter correction approach using the image data obtained from DIR as prior are characterized and compared on the basis of the same clinical patient cohort for the first time.  Methods:   Planning CT (pCT) and daily CBCT data (reconstructed images and measured projections) of four H&N and four prostate cancer patients have been considered in this study. A previously validated Morphons algorithm was used for DIR of the planning CT to the current CBCT image, yielding a so-called virtual CT (vCT). For the first time, this approach was translated from H&N to prostate cancer cases in the scope of proton therapy. The warped pCT images were also used as prior for scatter correction of the CBCT projections for both tumor sites. Single field uniform dose and IMPT (only for H&N cases) treatment plans have been generated with a research version of a commercial planning system. Dose calculations on vCT and scatter corrected CBCT (CBCTcor) were compared by means of the proton range and a gamma-index analysis. For the H&N cases, an additional diagnostic replanning CT (rpCT) acquired within three days of the CBCT served as additional reference. For the prostate patients, a comprehensive contour comparison of CBCT and vCT, using a trained physician's delineation, was performed.  Results:   A high agreement of vCT and CBCTcor was found in terms of the proton range and gamma-index analysis. For all patients and indications between 95% and 100% of the proton dose profiles in beam's eye view showed a range agreement of better than 3 mm. The pass rate in a (2%,2 mm) gamma-comparison was between 96% and 100%. For H&N patients, an equivalent agreement of vCT and CBCTcor to the reference rpCT was observed. However, for the prostate cases, an insufficient accuracy of the vCT contours retrieved from DIR was found, while the CBCTcor contours showed very high agreement to the contours delineated on the raw CBCT.  Conclusions:   For H&N patients, no considerable differences of vCT and CBCTcor were found. For prostate cases, despite the high dosimetric agreement, the DIR yields incorrect contours, probably due to the more pronounced anatomical changes in the abdomen and the reduced soft-tissue contrast in the CBCT. Using the vCT as prior, these inaccuracies can be overcome and images suitable for accurate delineation and dose calculation in CBCT-based adaptive IMPT can be retrieved from scatter correction of the CBCT projections.""","""['Christopher Kurz', 'Florian Kamp', 'Yang-Kyun Park', 'Christoph Zöllner', 'Simon Rit', 'David Hansen', 'Mark Podesta', 'Gregory C Sharp', 'Minglun Li', 'Michael Reiner', 'Jan Hofmaier', 'Sebastian Neppl', 'Christian Thieke', 'Reinoud Nijhuis', 'Ute Ganswindt', 'Claus Belka', 'Brian A Winey', 'Katia Parodi', 'Guillaume Landry']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Investigating CT to CBCT image registration for head and neck proton therapy as a tool for daily dose recalculation.', 'Comparing cone-beam CT intensity correction methods for dose recalculation in adaptive intensity-modulated photon and proton therapy for head and neck cancer.', 'Feasibility of automated proton therapy plan adaptation for head and neck tumors using cone beam CT images.', 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of volumetric image guidance in proton therapy.', 'CBCT-to-CT Translation Using Registration-Based Generative Adversarial Networks in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Deep learning-based 4D-synthetic CTs from sparse-view CBCTs for dose calculations in adaptive proton therapy.', 'A Comparison Study Between CNN-Based Deformed Planning CT and CycleGAN-Based Synthetic CT Methods for Improving iCBCT Image Quality.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of cone-beam CT-based synthetic CTs in pediatric patients undergoing intensity-modulated proton therapy.']"""

To determine whether targeting TGF-β signaling alone is sufficient to mitigate mCRPC, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing approach to generate a dominant-negative mutation of the cognate receptor TGFBRII that attenuated TGF-β signaling in mCRPC cells. As a result, the delicate balance of oncogenic homeostasis is perturbed, profoundly uncoupling proliferative and metastatic potential of TGFBRII-edited tumor xenografts. This signaling disturbance triggered feedback rewiring by enhancing ERK signaling known to promote EMT-driven metastasis. Circulating tumor cells displaying upregulated EMT genes had elevated biophysical deformity and an increase in interactions with chaperone macrophages for facilitating metastatic extravasation.

Methods and materials:   4067 prostate cancer patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT; n=2569; 63%) or brachytherapy with or without supplemental EBRT (n=1508; 27%). 43% (n=1738) were treated with neo-adjuvant and concurrent ADT and 57% (n=2329) with radiotherapy alone. Hip toxicity was defined as moderate or severe pain upon ambulation with or without the need for hip-revision surgery. Median follow-up was 7years (range, 3-21years).  Results:   One hundred twenty-one (2.7%) patients developed moderate-to-severe hip pain after radiotherapy affecting ambulation. Of these, 73 (60%) required hip replacement secondary to persistent hip pain. Among patients with baseline degenerative joint disease (DJD) changes on scans, 10-year incidence of hip-related toxicity was 11% versus 3% for those without such changes (P<.001). The only variables on multivariate analysis associated with hip-related toxicity post-radiotherapy were baseline DJD on imaging (P<.0001) and prolonged ADT for salvage therapy (P<.0001).  Conclusions:   Prostate EBRT or brachytherapy is associated with low incidence of long-term hip-related toxicity.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and potential molecular mechanisms of PACE4 on apoptosis in the Panc‑1 pancreatic cancer cell line. Cell proliferation was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Apoptotic nuclear shrinkage was monitored using Hoechst 33258 staining. Caspase‑3/7 activities were measured using a colorimetric caspase‑glo 3/7 assay. Alterations in protein expression were monitored using Western blot analysis. The results indicated that PACE4 small interfering (si)RNA inhibited cell proliferation and activated caspase‑3/7 activities. In addition, PACE4 siRNA significantly increased apoptosis via the activation of caspase‑3 and the downregulation of anti‑apoptotic proteins, X‑linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and phosphorylated‑Akt. In addition, the results showed deregulation of the B cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2)-associated X protein/Bcl‑2 ratio which led to the release of cytochrome c following PACE4 siRNA transfection.

Deregulated miR‑129 is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the potential role of miR‑129 in prostate cancer remains largely elusive. The present study investigated the role of miR‑129 as a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression and clinical prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The examined prostate cancer tissues exhibited a significant reduction in miR‑129 expression compared with the normal tissues (P=0.013). The expression levels of miR‑129 were negatively correlated with histological grade (P<0.001), high preoperative prostate‑specific antigen serum levels (P<0.001), pathological stage (P<0.001), high Gleason score (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), angiolymphatic invasion (P=0.018), and biochemical recurrence (BCR; P=0.001). Use of the Kaplan‑Meier analysis demonstrated that low miR‑129 expression was closely associated with poorer BCR‑free survival. Multivariate survival analysis indicated that miR‑129 expression may be an independent prognostic marker for BCR‑free survival in prostate cancer patients (P<0.001). Overexpression of miR‑129 markedly attenuated prostate cancer cell growth by rescuing cell cycle‑regulated protein expression. The present study suggests that miR‑129 is downregulated in the cancerous tissues of prostate cancer patients, which was associated with poor BCR‑free survival. Thus, it may be considered as a novel independent prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. In addition, downregulation of miR‑129 may serve a critical role in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Song Xu', 'Xiao-Ming Yi', 'Zheng-Yu Zhang', 'Jing-Ping Ge', 'Wen-Quan Zhou']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Downregulation of miR-129 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic implications of tissue and serum levels of microRNA-128 in human prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA expression and function in prostate cancer: a review of current knowledge and opportunities for discovery.', 'Crosstalk between miRNAs and DNA Methylation in Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the expressed miR-129 and miR-549a in patients with multiple sclerosis.', 'High expression of microRNA-1266 in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis of patients and biological cell growth.', 'MicroRNA-129-5p promotes proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating the BMP2 gene.', 'Chloroquine enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by inhibiting autophagy via upregulating miR129.']"""

Increased expression of the SOCS1-targeting miR30d correlates with higher biochemical recurrence, suggesting a tumor suppressor role of SOCS1 in PCa, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We have shown that SOCS1 inhibits MET receptor kinase signaling, a key oncogenic pathway in cancer progression. Here we evaluated the role of SOCS1 in attenuating MET signaling in PCa cells and tumor growth in vivo.  Methods:   MET-overexpressing human DU145 and PC3 PCa cell lines were stably transduced with SOCS1, and their growth, migration and invasion of collagen matrix were evaluated in vitro. Cells expressing SOCS1 or the control vector were evaluated for tumor growth in NOD.scid.gamma mice as xenograft or orthotopic tumors.  Results:   HGF-induced MET signaling was attenuated in SOCS1-expressing DU145 and PC3 cells. Compared with vector control cells, SOCS1-expressing cells showed reduced proliferation and impaired migration following HGF stimulation. DU145 and PC3 cells showed marked ability to invade the collagen matrix following HGF stimulation and this was attenuated by SOCS1. As xenografts, SOCS1-expressing PCa cells showed significantly reduced tumor growth compared with vector control cells. In the orthotopic tumor model, SOCS1 reduced the growth of primary tumors and metastatic spread. Intriguingly, the SOCS1-expressing DU145 and PC3 tumors showed increased collagen deposition, associated with increased frequency of myofibroblasts.  Conclusions:   Our findings support the tumor suppressor role of SOCS1 in PCa and suggest that attenuation of MET signaling is one of the underlying mechanisms.

Thereafter we assessed the expression status of FABP6 and FABP9 in both prostate cell lines and in human tissues. FABP6 protein was overexpressed only in 1 of the 5 malignant cell lines and its immunostaining intensities were not significantly different between benign and malignant prostate tissues. In contrast, FABP9 protein was highly expressed in highly malignant cell lines PC-3 and PC3-M, but its level in the benign PNT-2 and other malignant cell lines was not detectable. When analysed in an archival set of human prostate tissues, immunohistochemical staining intensity for FABP9 was significantly higher in carcinomas than in benign cases and the increase in FABP9 was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival times. Moreover, the increased level of staining for FABP9 was significantly associated with the increased joint Gleason scores (GS) and androgen receptor index (AR).

However, there have been few direct comparisons of IMRT with conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of IMRT in terms of toxicity and biochemical control.  Methods:   The medical records of 203 consecutive patients with localized to non-metastatic (stage T1a-T3bN0M0) prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The prescribed dose was 76 Gy delivered in 38 fractions in both the 3DCRT and IMRT treatment groups. The frequency of grade 2 or greater late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary toxicity and biochemical control were estimated by the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model with and without adjustment by the propensity score for treatment choice.  Results:   A total of 159 patients were included in the study (3DCRT: 70 patients, IMRT: 89 patients). The median follow-up period was 4.7 years. The estimated 5-year cumulative risk of late GI toxicity was significantly lower in the IMRT group than in the 3DCRT group (3.6 vs 13.2%, respectively, p = 0.022). After adjustment by propensity score, IMRT remained associated with a lower risk of late GI toxicity (hazard ratio 0.22; 95% confidence interval 0.058-0.85; p = 0.028). The 5-year biochemical failure-free rate was 93.2% in the 3DCRT group and 95.4% in the IMRT group (non-significant difference).  Conclusions:   The incidence of late GI toxicity was significantly lower in the IMRT group than in the 3DCRT group, while the biochemical control rates were no different between the two groups.

The primary objective was to measure the effect of selenium (as selenomethionine) on colorectal adenomas occurrence, with the effect of vitamin E (as α-tocopherol) supplementation on colorectal adenoma occurrence considered as a secondary objective. Participants who underwent lower endoscopy while in SELECT were identified from a subgroup of the 35,533 men randomized in the trial. Adenoma occurrence was ascertained from the endoscopy and pathology reports for these procedures. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of adenoma occurrence were generated comparing those randomized to selenium versus placebo and to vitamin E versus placebo based on the full factorial design. Evaluable endoscopy information was obtained for 6,546 participants, of whom 2,286 had 1+ adenomas. Apart from 21 flexible sigmoidoscopies, all the procedures yielding adenomas were colonoscopies.

Materials and methods:   Between 2002 and 2012, 548 patients were treated with EBRT followed by HDR boost. The effect of covariates and prostate volume on biochemical failure was analyzed by survival analysis and Cox regression model.  Results:   The median follow-up and age were not different between the two groups. The mean prostate gland volume at the time of CT planning was 48.1 and 76.0cc in small (<60cc) and large (⩾ 60cc) prostate volume, respectively (p<0.001).

There were no significant differences between the two groups for urinary symptoms (IPSS) as well as acute and late GI toxicities.  Conclusions:   This study showed that a HDR brachytherapy boost in large prostate gland cases is feasible at the price of increased PSA bounces. When the benign bounces are excluded, there is no significant difference between the two groups for tumor control and toxicity.

We investigated whether patient-derived HMD breast tissue could stimulate the progression of MCF10DCIS.com cells compared with patient-matched low mammographic density (LMD) tissue.  Methods:   Sterile breast specimens were obtained immediately after prophylactic mastectomy from high-risk women (n = 10). HMD and LMD regions of each specimen were resected under radiological guidance. Human MCF10DCIS.com cells, a model of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), were implanted into silicone biochambers in the groins of severe combined immunodeficiency mice, either alone or with matched LMD or HMD tissue (1:1), and maintained for 6 weeks. We assessed biochamber weight as a measure of primary tumour growth, histological grade of the biochamber material, circulating tumour cells and metastatic burden by luciferase and histology. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   HMD breast tissue led to increased primary tumour take, increased biochamber weight and increased proportions of high-grade DCIS and grade 3 invasive BCs compared with LMD. This correlated with an increased metastatic burden in the mice co-implanted with HMD tissue.

The method for screening for S5αR inhibition is key in finding new antagonists. In this study, the label-free S5αR inhibitory assay using LC-MS was developed. S5αR type 1 enzyme was obtained from LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The enzymatic assay was optimised for enzyme-substrate (testosterone) concentration, NADPH-cofactor concentration, solvent tolerance, enzyme activity stability and incubation time. The developed assay was validated by measuring the signal to background ratio (S/B), the signal to noise ratio (S/N), the signal window (SW) and the zeta factor Z' in accordance with published bioassay guidelines. The enzymatic reaction was performed in 96-well plates and DHT formation was determined by LC-MS. S/B, S/N, SW and Z' factor were well above acceptable criteria and the reproducibility was good using Z' factor other 3days and further validated by dutasteride and finasteride inhibition. The method was successfully applied to quantify S5αR inhibitory activity of some Thai herbal extracts. Two plant extracts, Impatiens balsamina L. and Curcuma longa L. showed IC50 at 5.4±0.2 and 9.0±1.2μgmL-1 and are therefore promising sources of new S5αR inhibitors.

However, clinical evidence suggests that androgen synthesis is not fully inhibited by abiraterone and the sustained androgen production may lead to disease relapse. In the present study, we identified AKR1C3, an important enzyme in the steroidogenesis pathway, as a critical mechanism driving resistance to abiraterone through increasing intracrine androgen synthesis and enhancing androgen signaling. We found that overexpression of AKR1C3 confers resistance to abiraterone while downregulation of AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant cells to abiraterone treatment. In abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells, AKR1C3 is overexpressed and the levels of intracrine androgens are elevated. In addition, AKR1C3 activation increases intracrine androgen synthesis and enhances androgen receptor (AR) signaling via activating AR transcriptional activity. Treatment of abiraterone-resistant cells with indomethacin, an AKR1C3 inhibitor, overcomes resistance and enhances abiraterone therapy both in vitro and in vivo by reducing the levels of intracrine androgens and diminishing AR transcriptional activity. These results demonstrate that AKR1C3 activation is a critical mechanism of resistance to abiraterone through increasing intracrine androgen synthesis and enhancing androgen signaling. Furthermore, this study provides a preclinical proof-of-principle for clinical trials investigating the combination of targeting AKR1C3 using indomethacin with abiraterone for advanced prostate cancer.

In prostate cancer (PCa) cells the androgen receptor (AR) is recruited by ELK1, via its amino-terminal domain (A/B), as a transcriptional co-activator, without ELK1 hyper-phosphorylation. Here we elucidate the structural basis of the interaction of AR with ELK1. The ELK1 polypeptide motifs required for co-activation by AR versus those required for activation of ELK1 by ERK were systematically mapped using a mammalian two-hybrid system and confirmed using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The mapping precisely identified the two ERK-docking sites in ELK1, the D-box and the DEF (docking site for ERK, FXFP) motif, as the essential motifs for its cooperation with AR(A/B) or WTAR. In contrast, the transactivation domain in ELK1 was only required for activation by ERK.

We analyzed early PSA response to enzalutamide and oncological outcomes to study their prognostic significance in the Japanese population.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-one patients with mCRPC (26 of pre-docetaxel and 25 of post-docetaxel status) were treated with enzalutamide. The PSA progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. The association of rPFS and OS in patients with an early PSA response at 4 weeks after commencement of enzalutamide was studied.  Results:   Early PSA responses were significantly associated with a longer rPFS (median of 47.9 vs. 20.1 weeks, p<0.001, in patients exhibiting a 50% PSA response; median of 40.9 vs. 20.1 weeks, p=0.016, in patients exhibiting a 30% PSA response). OS was also significantly associated with an early PSA response (p=0.002 for patients exhibiting a 50% PSA response, p=0.003 for patients exhibiting a 30% PSA response). Multivariate analysis showed that the predictors of a 50% PSA response were an interval to mCRPC and a docetaxel treatment history, while the predictor of a 30% PSA response was a docetaxel treatment history. Furthermore, a 50% PSA response was independently prognostic of rPFS.  Conclusion:   An early PSA response to enzalutamide was significantly associated with a longer rPFS and OS.

However, anticancer effect of monensin and its mechanism of action have yet to be investigated, especially against human prostate cancer cells.

Results:   In this study, monensin significantly inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in prostate cell lines. Moreover, cell growth inhibition by monensin induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis via regulation of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins in PC-3 cells. In addition, monensin induced the production of ROS and the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, that was restored by diphenyleneiodonium, a mitochondrial ROS inhibitor and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, respectively, as confirmed by pro-caspase-3 activation and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage.

An examination of HER2 and NF-κB receptor (RANK) coexpression revealed increased levels of both proteins in aggressive prostate tumors and metastatic deposits. Inhibiting HER2 expression in bone tumor xenografts reduced proliferation and RANK expression while maintaining EGFR expression. In examining the role of EGFR in tumor-initiating cells (TIC), we found that EGFR expression was required for primary and secondary sphere formation of prostate cancer cells. EGFR expression was also observed in circulating tumor cells (CTC) during prostate cancer metastasis. Dual inhibition of HER2 and EGFR resulted in significant inhibition of tumor xenograft growth, further supporting the significance of these receptors in prostate cancer progression. Overall, our results indicate that EGFR promotes survival of prostate TIC and CTC that metastasize to bone, whereas HER2 supports the growth of prostate cancer cells once they are established at metastatic sites.

Intraprostatic gold fiducial markers are used to visualize prostate position and motion before and during treatment. The aim of this report is to describe our experience of implanting intraprostatic fiducial markers under local anesthesia before hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for prostate cancer and to assess its tolerance and reproducibility.  Patients and methods:   Over a 6 and a half year period, 226 patients with prostate cancer received a stereotactic radiotherapy using the CyberKnife® system (Accuray) in our institution. Eighteen patients were treated for recurrence after prostatectomy; these patients were excluded from the study. Among the 208 remaining patients, 94 patients (45.2%) received stereotactic radiotherapy as a boost after external beam radiotherapy (three fractions of 6Gy); 36 patients (17.3%) were had a re-irradiation (six fractions of 6Gy) and 78 patients (37.5%) had a exclusive stereotactic radiotherapy (68 patients received five fractions of 7.25Gy and 11 patients five fractions of 6.25Gy). Four markers were implanted in all patients using transrectal ultrasound; the procedure was performed under local anesthesia, using transperineal access. The four fiducial markers were implanted in two strands with two fiducial each one, 1cm apart. In order to follow the recommendations of the image-guided radiotherapy system, the two strands of the two markers were located on the same plane in the middle of the prostate, at least 2cm apart from the midline. After insertion, correct positioning of fiducials markers was verified by X-ray. Dosimetry scanning was performed after the implantation procedure; prostate position tracking was possible before and during treatment through the kilovoltage incorporated system of the robotic accelerator. Clinical data, X-ray verification and dosimetry scanner have been retrospectively reviewed for all patients.  Results:   The tolerance to procedure was excellent; only four patients (1.8%) described pain related to implant. No urinary side effects were reported. Median time from fiducial implantation to dosimetry scanner was 16 days (4-113 days). Four fiducials were found within the prostate at dosimetry scanner in 181 patients and three in 27 remaining patients. All intraprostatic fiducials were used to track the prostate gland before and during treatment.  Conclusions:   Intraprostatic fiducial markers implantation is a safe and reproducible procedure that allows us to have reliable prostate information before and during stereotactic radiotherapy.""","""['A Cordoba', 'D Pasquier', 'P Nickers', 'T Lacornerie', 'É Lartigau']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Intraprostatic calcifications as natural fiducial markers in image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Fiducial marker implantation in prostate radiation therapy: complication rates and technique.', 'Ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of fiducial markers for image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer without local anesthesia: Patient-reported gastrointestinal-genitourinary system complications and pain.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Studies of Intra-Fraction Prostate Motion During Stereotactic Irradiation in First Irradiation and Re-Irradiation.', 'Fiducial markers implantation for prostate image-guided radiotherapy: a report on the transperineal approach.']"""

Using proportional hazard models for competing risks, we determined which parameters predict competing mortality in patients selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older and compared the prognostic impact of individual parameters with that of their younger counterparts. Three common diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and other cancer) that predicted competing mortality in younger men were not predictors of competing mortality in men selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older (hazard ratio [HR]:<1). Besides age (HR/yr: 1.08, p=0.0255), peripheral vascular disease (HR: 2.33, p=0.0195), cerebrovascular disease (HR: 2.23, p=0.0242), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 3 (HR: 2.19, p<0.0001), current smoking (HR: 2.18, p=0.0098), and lower or unknown level of education (HR: 2.07, p=0.0002) were independent predictors of competing mortality in patients aged 70 yr or older. Combining these five conditions in a score might provide a superior comorbidity measure in this particular population.  Patient summary:   Stricter selection may diminish the prognostic significance of several common diseases in men selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older whereas other parameters (peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 3, current smoking, and level of education) sustained their meaningfulness and should be taken into consideration when the risk of competing mortality is estimated.""","""['Michael Froehner', 'Rainer Koch', 'Matthias Hübler', 'Stefan Zastrow', 'Manfred P Wirth']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Predicting Competing Mortality in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy Aged 70 yr or Older.', 'An easily applicable single condition-based mortality index for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy.', 'Level of education and mortality after radical prostatectomy.', 'Validation of an Age-adjusted Prostate Cancer-Specific Comorbidity Index.', 'Importance of radical prostatectomy for patients older than 70 years.', 'Presurgical assessments.', 'Evaluation of comorbidity indices in determining the most suitable candidates for uro-oncological surgeries in elderly men.', 'Localised prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy or deferred treatment strategy.', 'Mortality prediction following non-traumatic amputation of the lower extremity.', 'Effects of age and comorbidity on survival vary according to risk grouping among patients with prostate cancer treated using radical prostatectomy: A retrospective competing-risk analysis from the K-CaP registry.', 'Radical prostatectomy in patients aged 75 years or older: review of the literature.']"""

We wanted to establish a novel treatment modality combining HDR-brachytherapy and conservative surgery.  Material and methods:   We performed an organ preserving tumor resection with intraoperative placement of brachytherapy tubes. Suitable patients were selected following assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy where organ preserving surgical resection was deemed feasible. In bladder-prostate rhabdomyosarcoma, only tumors located below the bladder neck could be treated by brachytherapy. After surgery, high dose rate brachytherapy was carried out for 30-36Gy total dose.  Results:   A total of 11 patients were treated up to now (embryonal histology n=10, alveolar histology n=1) with a median follow-up of 18months [4-80]. All patients were IRS group III. There were no significant side effects. One patient had local relapse and was successfully treated with re-excision. All other patients are in the first complete remission. One patient developed a neurogenic bladder and required creation of a Mitrofanoff stoma.

Several reports have highlighted the association of low serum testosterone levels with high-grade, high-stage PCa. However, the impact of serum testosterone as a predictor of progression in men with low-risk PCa has been little assessed.In this study, we evaluated the association of circulating testosterone concentrations with a staging/grading reclassification in a cohort of low-risk PCa patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the AS protocol but opting for radical prostatectomy.Radical prostatectomy (RP) was performed in 338 patients, eligible for AS according to the following criteria: clinical stage T2a or less, PSA<10ng/ml, two or fewer cancer cores, Gleason score (GS)≤6 and PSA density<0.2 ng/mL/cc. Reclassification was defined as upstaging (stage>pT2) and upgrading (GS≥7; primary Gleason pattern 4) disease. Unfavorable disease was defined as the occurrence of pathological stage>pT2 and predominant Gleason score 4. Total testosterone was measured before surgery.Low serum testosterone levels (<300 ng/dL) were significantly associated with upgrading, upstaging, unfavorable disease and positive surgical margins. The addition of testosterone to a base model, including age, PSA, PSA density, clinical stage and positive cancer involvement in cores, showed a significant independent influence of this variable on upstaging, upgrading and unfavorable disease.In conclusion, our results support the idea that total testosterone should be a selection criterion for inclusion of low-risk PCa patients in AS programs and suggest that testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL should be considered a discouraging factor when a close AS program is considered as treatment option.""","""['Matteo Ferro', 'Giuseppe Lucarelli', 'Dario Bruzzese', 'Giuseppe Di Lorenzo', 'Sisto Perdonà', 'Riccardo Autorino', 'Francesco Cantiello', 'Roberto La Rocca', 'Gian Maria Busetto', 'Amelia Cimmino', 'Carlo Buonerba', 'Michele Battaglia', 'Rocco Damiano', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Daniela Terracciano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Low serum testosterone predicts upgrading and upstaging of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Body mass index was associated with upstaging and upgrading in patients with low-risk prostate cancer who met the inclusion criteria for active surveillance.', 'No detrimental effect of a positive family history on postoperative upgrading and upstaging in men with low risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: implications for active surveillance.', 'Active surveillance and surgery in localized prostate cancer.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

In this study, we hypothesize that pre-diabetes, which is characterised by having impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired HbA1C, may influence circulating sex steroid hormone concentrations in men. Thus, we investigated whether serum sex steroid hormone concentrations differ between men with and without pre-diabetes. We analyzed data for 1139 men who were aged 20+ years when they participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We calculated adjusted geometric mean serum concentrations of total and estimated free testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide, total and estimated free estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in men with and without pre-diabetes. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) of lower concentrations of androgens and SHBG, and higher concentrations of estradiol by prediabetes status. Adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, total testosterone concentration was lower among men with (geometric mean: 4.68 ng/mL) than without (5.36 ng/mL, p = 0.01) pre-diabetes. SHBG concentration was also lower in men with (31.67 nmol/L) than without (36.16 nmol/L; p = 0.01) pre-diabetes. Concentrations of the other hormones did not differ between men with and without pre-diabetes. After adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors, pre-diabetic men had a higher odds of lower testosterone (OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.54-4.29), higher free estradiol level (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.14-2.22), and lower SHBG level (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.32-3.92) compared to men without pre-diabetes. These associations were attenuated after adjusting for adiposity (testosterone OR: 1.76; 95% CI 0.95-3.27, free estradiol OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.88-1.88, SHBG OR: 1.71; 95% CI 0.88-3.30).

Subjects and methods:   Using prostate cancer as an example, a Qualtrics online market survey of Australian healthcare consumers recruited from an online pool was conducted. The number of districts sampled within each state or territory was proportional to the size of the target population within each region and were proportionately distributed across metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Demographic characteristics were comparable with the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census figures corresponding to the target age group. The survey assessed knowledge of the roles of medical specialties through open-ended responses to qualitative items, association tasks, and recall/recognition questions. Subjects were asked to rate their familiarity of medical specialists and of six medical specialty logos.  Results:   There were 302 respondents. Subjects indicated less awareness of urology vs other medical specialties, were relatively unaware that urologists were concerned with the prostate, and the USANZ branding was among the least familiar (P < 0.001, Friedman test). When asked the first medical specialist that came to mind when told of prostate cancer, only 22% wrote urologist.  Conclusion:   The general public has a limited understanding of urologists and of the USANZ.

However, the physiological function of STEAP1 remains unknown. Here for the first time, we purified a mammalian (rabbit) STEAP1 at a milligram level, permitting its high-quality biochemical and biophysical characterizations. We found that STEAP1 likely assembles as a homotrimer and forms a heterotrimer when co-expressed with STEAP2. Each STEAP1 protomer binds one heme prosthetic group that is mainly low-spin with a pair of histidine axial ligands, with small portions of high-spin and P450-type heme. In its ferrous state, STEAP1 is capable of reducing transition metal ion complexes of Fe3+ and Cu2+. Ferrous STEAP1 also reacts readily with O2 through an outer sphere redox mechanism. Kinetics with all three substrates are biphasic with ∼80 and ∼20% for the fast and slow phases, respectively, in line with its heme heterogeneity. STEAP1 retained a low level of bound FAD during purification, and the binding equilibrium constant, KD, was ∼30 μM.

We investigated whether TIL infiltration of tumor tissues could also predict the outcome of prostate cancer patients. To this end, we carried out a retrospective analysis correlating the outcome of locally advanced prostate cancer patients undergone salvage radiotherapy upon relapse after radical surgery with the infiltration by different TIL populations. Twenty-two patients with resectable prostate cancer, with a mean age of 67 (+/-3.93) years, who received salvage radiotherapy with a mean of 69.66 (+/- 3.178) Gy in 8 weeks, between June 1999 and January 2009 and with a median follow up of 123 (+/- 55.82) months, were enrolled in this study. We evaluated, by immunohistochemistry, the intratumoral (t) and peripheral stroma (p) infiltration by CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CCR7, FoxP3 or PD-1-positive cells on tumor samples taken at the diagnosis (d) and relapse times (R). We correlated these variables with patients' biochemical progression free survival (bPFS), post-radiotherapy progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Substantial changes in the rate of TIL subsets were found between the first and the second biopsy with progressive increase in CD4, CCR7, FoxP3, PD-1+ cells. Our analysis revealed that higher CD8p,R+ and lower PD-1R+ TIL scores correlated to a longer bPFS. Higher CD8p,R+ and CCR7t,R+ TIL scores and lower CD45p,R+ and FoxP3p,R+ TIL scores correlated to a prolonged PFS and OS.

There is an urgent need to detect biomarkers that will improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) is playing a key role in cancer research and it can be useful to unravel the molecular profile of prostate cancer biopsies.  Methods:   MALDI imaging data sets are highly complex and their interpretation requires the use of multivariate statistical methods. In this study, MALDI-IMS technology, sequential principal component analysis (PCA) and two-dimensional (2-D) peak distribution tests were employed to investigate tumor heterogeneity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer biopsies.  Results:   Multivariate statistics revealed a number of mass ion peaks obtained from different tumor regions that were distinguishable from the adjacent normal regions within a given specimen. These ion peaks have been used to generate ion images and visualize the difference between tumor and normal regions. Mass peaks at m/z 3370, 3441, 3447 and 3707 exhibited stronger ion signals in the tumor regions.  Conclusions:   This study reports statistically significant mass ion peaks unique to tumor regions in adenocarcinoma of the prostate and adds to the clinical utility of MALDI-IMS for analysis of FFPE tissue at a molecular level that supersedes all other standard histopathologic techniques for diagnostic purposes used in the current clinical practice.

Results:   Low-risk PCa included 170 cases (38.8%) and tumor upgrading was detected in 111 patients (65.3%): 72 (42.4%) had pathology Gleason pattern (pGP) 3 + 4, 27 (15.9%) pGP 4 + 3, and 12 (7.1%) pGP 4 + 4. Prostate- specific antigen (PSA) and proportion of positive cores (P+) were independent predictors of upgrading to high-risk disease. These factors also stratified the risk of tumor upgrading to the increasing patterns of the tumor grading system. The model allowed the identification of pGP 4 + 4. The main difference between high-risk PCa and other upgraded tumors related to PSA load (odds ratio 2.4) that associated with high volume disease in the specimen.

The following commentary provides an example of years of potential life lost (YPLL) and economic productivity as it relates to TCa to encourage diversity in male health research and scholarship topical areas. Overall incidence and mortality rates overwhelmingly support a disparate burden from PCa as compared to other male-specific outcomes, specifically, TCa. When factoring in YPLL and lost economic activity as a result of early death, that disparity essentially dissipates. This discussion will provide an alternative disposition on how males are affected by PCa and TCa. Although PCa has much larger mortality and incidence rates compared to TCa, the amount of life a man potentially lo ses (nearly quadrupled) if he would die of TCa as compared to PCa assists in balancing out the disparate aforementioned burden.

Some of them have had a high clinical impact on the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. However, the number of 18F-labeled tracers addressing PSMA is still limited. Therefore, we aimed to develop a radiofluorinated molecule resembling the structure of therapeutic PSMA-617. Methods: The nonradioactive reference compound PSMA-1007 and the precursor were produced by solid-phase chemistry. The radioligand 18F-PSMA-1007 was produced by a 2-step procedure with the prosthetic group 6-18F-fluoronicotinic acid 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester. The binding affinity of the ligand for PSMA and its internalization properties were evaluated in vitro with PSMA-positive LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) cells. Further, organ distribution studies were performed with mice bearing LNCaP and PC-3 (prostate cancer cell line; PSMA-negative) tumors. Finally, small-animal PET imaging of an LNCaP tumor-bearing mouse was performed. Results: The identified ligand had a binding affinity of 6.7 ± 1.7 nM for PSMA and an exceptionally high internalization ratio (67% ± 13%) in vitro. In organ distribution studies, high and specific tumor uptake (8.0 ± 2.4 percentage injected dose per gram) in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice was observed.

However, whether competing mortality (CM) affects the ability of ADT to improve, survival remains unanswered.  Methods and materials:   We calculated a CM risk score using a Fine-Gray semiparametric model that included age and cardiometabolic comorbidities from a cohort of 17,669 men treated with high-dose RT with or without supplemental ADT for nonmetastatic PC. Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis was used to assess whether ADT reduced the risk of PC-specific mortality for men with a low versus a high risk of CM among the 4550 patients within the intermediate- and high-risk cohort after adjustment for established PC prognostic factors, year of treatment, site, and ADT propensity score.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, 1065 men had died, 89 (8.36%) of PC. Among the men with a low CM score, ADT use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PC-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.87, P=.02) but was not for men with high CM (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 0.77-2.30, P=.30).  Conclusions:   Adding ADT to high-dose RT appears to be associated with decreased PC-specific mortality risk in men with a low but not a high CM score. These data should serve to heighten awareness about the importance of considering competing risks when determining whether to add ADT to RT for older men with intermediate- or high-risk PC.""","""['Brent S Rose', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Jing Wu', 'Michelle H Braccioforte', 'Brian J Moran', 'Daniel E Doseretz', 'Michael J Katin', 'Rudolf H Ross', 'Sharon A Salenius', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of death from prostate cancer among men with favorable or unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.', 'Evaluation of the effectiveness of adding androgen deprivation to modern dose-escalated radiotherapy for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Race and mortality risk after radiation therapy in men treated with or without androgen-suppression therapy for favorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'The role of androgen deprivation therapy combined with prostate brachytherapy.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on apparent diffusion coefficient and T2w MRI for histogram and texture analysis with respect to focal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between December 1998 and June 2004, 446 patients with T1b-T3, N0pNx, M0 prostate carcinoma were randomly assigned to either pelvic nodes and prostate or prostate-only radiation therapy. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: ""low risk"" (T1-T2 and Gleason score 6 and prostate-specific antigen <3× the upper normal limit of the laboratory) (92 patients) versus ""high risk"" (T3 or Gleason score >6 or prostate-specific antigen >3× the upper normal limit of the laboratory). Short-term 6-month neoadjuvant and concomitant hormonal therapy was allowed only for high-risk patients. Radiation therapy was delivered with a 3-dimensional conformal technique, using a 4-field technique for the pelvic volume (46 Gy). The total dose recommended to the prostate moved from 66 Gy to 70 Gy during the course of the study. Criteria for EFS included biologic prostate-specific antigen recurrences and/or a local or metastatic progression.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 11.4 years, the 10-year OS and EFS were similar in the 2 treatment arms. A higher but nonsignificant EFS was observed in the low-risk subgroup in favor of pelvic nodes radiation therapy (77.2% vs 62.5%; P=.18). A post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit of pelvic irradiation when the risk of lymph node involvement was <15% (Roach formula). This benefit seemed to be limited to patients who did not receive hormonal therapy.  Conclusion:   Pelvic nodes irradiation did not statistically improve EFS or OS in the whole population but may be beneficial in selected low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with exclusive radiation therapy.""","""['Pascal Pommier', 'Sylvie Chabaud', 'Jean-Leon Lagrange', 'Pierre Richaud', 'Elisabeth Le Prise', 'Jean-Philippe Wagner', 'David Azria', 'Veronique Beckendorf', 'Jean-Philippe Suchaud', 'Valerie Bernier', 'David Perol', 'Christian Carrie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The role of pelvic irradiation in node-negative prostate adenocarcinoma remains unclear : Long-term results from the GETUG-01 study.', 'In Regard to Pommier et al.', 'Is there a role for pelvic irradiation in localized prostate adenocarcinoma?

Methods:   Add-Aspirin is a phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial with four parallel cohorts. Patients who have undergone potentially curative treatment for breast (n=3100), colorectal (n=2600), gastro-oesophageal (n=2100) or prostate cancer (n=2120) are registered into four tumour specific cohorts. All cohorts recruit in the United Kingdom, with the breast and gastro-oesophageal cohort also recruiting in India. Eligible participants first undertake an active run-in period where 100mg aspirin is taken daily for approximately eight weeks. Participants who are able to adhere and tolerate aspirin then undergo a double-blind randomisation and are allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 100mg aspirin, 300mg aspirin or a matched placebo to be taken daily for at least five years. Those participants ≥75years old are only randomised to 100mg aspirin or placebo due to increased toxicity risk.  Results:   The primary outcome measures are invasive disease-free survival for the breast cohort, disease-free survival for the colorectal cohort, overall survival for the gastro-oesophageal cohort, and biochemical recurrence-free survival for the prostate cohort, with a co-primary outcome of overall survival across all cohorts.

The CHIP assay demonstrated that Nrf2 is one transcription factor of FPN and promotes its transcription. With the increase of Nrf2 in PC3 cells, the viability, migration ability and concentration of ferritin were suppressed, while the apoptosis rate was increased. The above effects were counteracted by down-regulating FPN.FPN could inhibit the prostate cancer cell viability, migration and mitosis, which is also related to a decrease of intracellular ferritin content.

The four planar CT scanned catheter arrangements included; catheters placed approximately 1, 0.5 cm apart, catheters closely arranged in a plan (<0.5 cm apart) and a loop arrangement. The intracavitary plan consisted of catheters arranged inside a mould configuration. All reconstruction methods were based on tracking wire markers placed inside the plastic catheters. Each of these catheter arrangements was reconstructed using an existing window adjustment technique (manual reconstruction) in the treatment planning system followed by a CT-based automated thresholding technique available in the same planning system. A corresponding reconstructed catheter was created using a segmented catheter structure using image thresholding from another planning system within the same department. Co-ordinates from all the reconstructed catheters were compared against each other to assess the geometric shift between manual and threshold based reconstruction on each transaxial image using in-house software and the maximum variations were recorded for assessment. It was observed in general that automated thresholding technique could assist in catheter reconstruction for catheters which are greater than 0.5 cm apart. The segmented thresholding method reported smaller variations when compared to the manual reconstruction using window adjustment technique. Automated reconstruction saves time in the brachytherapy planning, however it was noted that it is not feasible for closely spaced catheters.

Materials and methods:   The genomic expression of 20 stroma-derived factors, including the androgen receptor (AR), growth factors (FGF2, FGF7, FGF10, HGF, TGFβ, PDGFB), protein implicated in invasion (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-11), inflammation (IL-6, IL-17, STAT-3 and NFκB), stroma/epithelium interaction (CDH11, FAP, CXCL12 and CXCL14) and chaperones (HPA1A and HSF1), was evaluated in cultured fibroblasts both from BHP and prostate carcinomas (PCa). After isolation and culture of fibroblasts by biopsy specimens, RNA was isolated and genomic studies performed.  Results:   Finally, 5 BPH and 37 PCa specimens were selected: clinically localized (19), metastatic (5), CSCP (7) and CRPC (6). Interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17RB) was highly expressed in CAFs compared with fibroblasts from BPH. However, metalloproteinase-2 and chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) were expressed at higher levels by fibroblasts from BPH. The fibroblastic growth factor-7 was highly expressed by CAFs from localized tumors, but metalloproteinase-11 in metastatic tumors. MMP-11, androgen receptor (AR) and heat-shock-70kda-protein-1A (HSPA1A) expressions were significantly higher in CAFs from CRPC.

In this study, hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles successfully encapsulated epigallocatechin-3-gallate and were efficiently internalized into cancer cells via CD44 ligand receptor recognition, induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, and inhibited prostate cancer cell growth. Furthermore, in vivo assays indicated that these nanoparticles specifically bind CD44 receptors and increase apoptosis of cancer cells, leading to significant decreases in prostate tumor activity and tumor tissue inflammation.""","""['Wen-Ying Huang', 'Jia-Ni Lin', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Shen-Chieh Chou', 'Chih-Ho Lai', 'Eun-Jin Yun', 'U-Ging Lo', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Jui-Hsiang Lin', 'Yu-Hsin Lin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Hyaluronic acid-serum albumin conjugate-based nanoparticles for targeted cancer therapy.', 'Hyaluronic acid-modified polyamidoamine dendrimer G5-entrapped gold nanoparticles delivering METase gene inhibits gastric tumor growth via targeting CD44+ gastric cancer cells.', 'Active Tumor-Targeted co-Delivery of Epigallocatechin Gallate and Doxorubicin in Nanoparticles for Combination Gastric Cancer Therapy.', 'Hyaluronic acid targeting of CD44 for cancer therapy: from receptor biology to nanomedicine.', 'Lipid-based nanosystems for CD44 targeting in cancer treatment: recent significant advances, ongoing challenges and unmet needs.', 'Transcriptome Analysis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cells Inducibly Expressing MyD88 L265P Mutation Identifies Upregulated CD44, LGALS3, NFKBIZ, and BATF as Downstream Targets of Oncogenic NF-κB Signaling.', 'Natural Polymeric Composites Derived from Animals, Plants, and Microbes for Vaccine Delivery and Adjuvant Applications: A Review.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Biological Assays of Dextran Coated Iron Oxide Aqueous Magnetic Fluids.', 'RGD-Coated Polymer Nanoworms for Enriching Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

The method, named spatially multiplexed interferometric microscopy (SMIM), proposes an off-axis holographic architecture implemented onto a regular (nonholographic) microscope with minimum modifications: the use of coherent illumination and a properly placed and selected one-dimensional diffraction grating. In this contribution, we report on the implementation of partially (temporally reduced) coherent illumination in SMIM as a way to improve quantitative phase imaging. The use of low coherence sources forces the application of phase shifting algorithm instead of off-axis holographic recording to recover the sample’s phase information but improves phase reconstruction due to coherence noise reduction. In addition, a less restrictive field of view limitation (1/2) is implemented in comparison with our previously reported scheme (1/3). The proposed modification is experimentally validated in a regular Olympus BX-60 upright microscope considering a wide range of samples (resolution test, microbeads, swine sperm cells, red blood cells, and prostate cancer cells).""","""['José Ángel Picazo-Bueno', 'Zeev Zalevsky', 'Javier García', 'Carlos Ferreira', 'Vicente Micó']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Single-shot two-frame π-shifted spatially multiplexed interference phase microscopy.', 'Spatially-multiplexed interferometric microscopy (SMIM): converting a standard microscope into a holographic one.', 'Hilbert-Huang single-shot spatially multiplexed interferometric microscopy.', 'Phase recovery and lensless imaging by iterative methods in optical, X-ray and electron diffraction.', 'Multi-Illumination Single-Holographic-Exposure Lensless Fresnel (MISHELF) Microscopy: Principles and Biomedical Applications.', 'Common-path intrinsically achromatic optical diffraction tomography.', 'Single-shot two-frame π-shifted spatially multiplexed interference phase microscopy.']"""

Results:   Among those patients who survived for at least 180 days, 20.9 % had used psychotropic medications; sedatives were the most frequently prescribed (14.3 %), followed by antidepressants (5.5 %), anxiolytics (3.6 %), and antipsychotics (2.7 %). Lung cancer, prostate cancer, and oral cancer showed a significant association with the regular use of medication in the first 180 days. Among patients who survived for at least 2.5 years, 4.8 % still used psychotropic medication on a regular basis. Lung cancer and prostate cancer were associated with such prolonged use.

Differences in interpretation, expertise and application of mpMRI are responsible for the range of reported results.  Methods:   This retrospective clinical study was conducted with consecutive patients through an electronic database of tertiary hospitals and adjacent private urology practices in Australia. Patients having undergone RP were assessed for the presence of a pre-operative mpMRI performed between 2013 and 2015 which was evaluated against the reference standard of the RP whole-mount specimen. MRI reports were evaluated using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS).  Results:   In our cohort of 152 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of mpMRI (PI-RADS ≥ 4) for prostate cancer (Gleason ≥ 4 + 3) detection were 83 and 47%, respectively. For the identification of extraprostatic disease, the sensitivity and specificity were 29 and 94%, respectively.  Conclusion:   These results represent a 'real-world' approach to mpMRI and appear comparable to other single-centre studies.

Techniques to isolate single cells such as microfluidics sorting and magnetic capturing systems have limitations such as: high cost, labor intense, and the requirement of a large number of cells. Therefore, the goal of our current study is to identify a cost and labor effective, reliable, and reproducible technique that allows single cell isolation for analysis to promote regular laboratory use, including standard reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In the current study, we utilized single prostate cells isolated from the CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line and human prostate clinical specimens, based on the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter efflux of dye cycle violet (DCV), side population assay. Expression of four genes: ABCG2; Aldehyde dehydrogenase1A1 (ALDH1A1); androgen receptor (AR); and embryonic stem cell marker, Oct-4, were determined. Results from the current study in the CWR-R1 cell line showed ABCG2 and ALDH1A1 gene expression in 67% of single side population cells and in 17% or 100% of non-side population cells respectively. Studies using single cells isolated from clinical specimens showed that the Oct-4 gene is detected in only 22% of single side population cells and in 78% of single non-side population cells. Whereas, AR gene expression is in 100% single side population and non-side population cells isolated from the same human prostate clinical specimen. These studies show that performing RT-PCR on single cells isolated by FACS can be successfully conducted to determine gene expression in single cells from cell lines and enzymatically digested tissue. While these studies provide a simple yes/no expression readout, the more sensitive quantitative RT-PCR would be able to provide even more information if necessary.""","""['Kalyan J Gangavarapu', 'Austin Miller', 'Wendy J Huss']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Single Cell Biol""","""['Aldehyde dehydrogenase and ATP binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) functional assays isolate different populations of prostate stem cells where ABCG2 function selects for cells with increased stem cell activity.', 'ABCG2-mediated DyeCycle Violet efflux defined side population in benign and malignant prostate.', 'The Efflux Transporter ABCG2 Maintains Prostate Stem Cells.', 'Characterization of fibroblast-free CWR-R1ca castration-recurrent prostate cancer cell line.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Using a unique model of AR pathway inhibitor-resistant prostate cancer, we identified AR-dependent control of the neural transcription factor BRN2 (encoded by POU3F2) as a major driver of NEPC and aggressive tumor growth, both in vitro and in vivo Mechanistic studies showed that AR directly suppresses BRN2 transcription, which is required for NEPC, and BRN2-dependent regulation of the NEPC marker SOX2. Underscoring its inverse correlation with classic AR activity in clinical samples, BRN2 expression was highest in NEPC tumors and was significantly increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with adenocarcinoma, especially in patients with low serum PSA. These data reveal a novel mechanism of AR-dependent control of NEPC and suggest that targeting BRN2 is a strategy to treat or prevent neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate tumors.  Significance:   Understanding the contribution of the AR to the emergence of highly lethal, drug-resistant NEPC is critical for better implementation of current standard-of-care therapies and novel drug design. Our first-in-field data underscore the consequences of potent AR inhibition in prostate tumors, revealing a novel mechanism of AR-dependent control of neuroendocrine differentiation, and uncover BRN2 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent emergence of NEPC.
