Objectives:   Our aim was to examine the relationship between thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) with cancer incidence (all cancers, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer). Associations with cancer-related deaths were also explored.  Design and setting:   A prospective cohort study involving community-dwelling men aged 70-89 years.  Main outcome measures:   Thyroid hormones were measured in 3836 men between 2001 and 2004. Competing risks analyses were used to perform longitudinal analyses with results expressed as subhazard ratios (SHR). Outcomes were ascertained through electronic linkage until 20 June 2013.  Results:   Mean age was 77·0 ± 3·6 years. A total of 864 men developed cancers, and 506 experienced cancer-related deaths. A total of 340, 136 and 119 men developed prostate, colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. After adjustments, there were no associations between TSH and incidence of all cancers, prostate or lung cancer. Higher TSH was associated with increased colorectal cancer incidence (SHR = 1·19, 95% CI 1·00-1·42; P = 0·048 for every 1 SD increase in log TSH). This association was strengthened after excluding the first year of follow-up (SHR = 1·23, 95% CI 1·02-1·48, P = 0·028). FT4 was not associated with incidence of all cancers, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer. Thyroid hormones were not associated with cancer-related deaths.  Conclusion:   In community-dwelling older men, FT4 was not associated with cancer incidence. Higher TSH is independently associated with increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether a causal relationship exists.""","""['Yi X Chan', 'Helman Alfonso', 'Stephen Anthony Paul Chubb', 'Peter Gerard Fegan', 'Graeme J Hankey', 'Jonathan Golledge', 'Leon Flicker', 'Bu B Yeap']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)""","""['Lower TSH and higher free thyroxine predict incidence of prostate but not breast, colorectal or lung cancer.', 'Higher Dihydrotestosterone Is Associated with the Incidence of Lung Cancer in Older Men.', 'In older men, lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with reduced incidence of prostate, but not colorectal or lung cancer.', 'Higher free thyroxine levels are associated with all-cause mortality in euthyroid older men: the Health In Men Study.', 'Thyroid function and cancer risk: a prospective population study.', 'The Clinical Relevance of Hypothyroidism in Patients with Solid Non-Thyroid Cancer: A Tantalizing Conundrum.', 'Association Between Thyroid Disorders and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Adult Patients in Taiwan.', 'Thyroid Hormones and Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies.']"""

The one-carbon metabolism pathway and related metabolites determine cellular DNA methylation and thus is thought to play a pivotal role in PCa occurrence. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of genetic variants in one-carbon metabolism genes to prostate cancer (PCa) risk and the underlying biological mechanisms. In this hospital-based case-control study of 1817 PCa cases and 2026 cancer-free controls, we genotyped six polymorphisms in three one-carbon metabolism genes and assessed their association with the risk of PCa. We found two noncoding MTR variants, rs28372871 T > G and rs1131450 G > A, were independently associated with a significantly increased risk of PCa. The rs28372871 GG genotype (adjusted OR = 1.40, P = 0.004) and rs1131450 AA genotype (adjusted OR = 1.64, P = 0.007) exhibited 1.40-fold and 1.64-fold higher risk of PCa, respectively, compared with their respective homozygous wild-type genotypes. Further functional analyses revealed these two variants contribute to reducing MTR expression, elevating homocysteine and SAH levels, reducing methionine and SAM levels, increasing SAH/SAM ratio, and promoting the invasion of PCa cells in vitro. Collectively, our data suggest regulatory variants of the MTR gene significantly increase the PCa risk via decreasing methylation potential. These findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Yuan-Yuan Qu', 'Shu-Xian Zhou', 'Xuan Zhang', 'Rui Zhao', 'Cheng-Yuan Gu', 'Kun Chang', 'Xiao-Qun Yang', 'Hua-Lei Gan', 'Bo Dai', 'Hai-Liang Zhang', 'Guo-Hai Shi', 'Yao Zhu', 'Ding-Wei Ye', 'Jian-Yuan Zhao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs1805087) in the methionine synthase (METH) gene increases the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Human methionine synthase A2756G polymorphism increases susceptibility to prostate cancer.', 'Role of polymorphism of methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) A2756G and breast cancer risk.', 'Association of Three Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in MTR and MTRR Genes with Lung Cancer in a Turkish Population.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Three Gene Variants Association with Risk of Prostate Cancer: An Update.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.', 'Maternal polymorphic loci of rs1979277 serine hydroxymethyl transferase and rs1805087 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate are correlated with the development of fetal growth restriction: A case-control study.', 'Update analysis on the association between Methionine synthase rs1805087 A/G variant and risk of prostate cancer.', 'A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs1805087) in the methionine synthase (METH) gene increases the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Human methionine synthase A2756G polymorphism increases susceptibility to prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To inform educational materials addressing patient questions and concerns about the 2012 USPSTF guidelines, we sought to: (i) characterize patient perceptions about prostate cancer screening benefits, harms and recommendations against screening, and (ii) compare perceptions across race, age and PSA level subgroups.  Methods:   We conducted qualitative interviews with a sample of 26 men from the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, stratified by race (African American, other), age (50-69, 70-84) and PSA level (documented PSA level ≥4 in Veterans Health Administration electronic medical records vs no such documentation). We used an inductive approach informed by grounded theory to analyse transcribed interviews.  Results:   Most men in all subgroups expressed misperceptions about the benefits of prostate cancer screening and had difficulty identifying harms associated with screening. In all subgroups, reactions to recommendations against screening ranged from unconditionally receptive to highly resistant. Some men in every subgroup initially resistant to the idea said they would accept a recommendation to discontinue screening from their provider.  Conclusions:   Given the similarity of perceptions and reactions across subgroups, materials targeted by race, age and PSA level may not be necessary. Efforts to inform decision making about prostate cancer screening should address misperceptions about benefits and lack of awareness of harms. Provider perspectives and recommendations may play a pivotal role in shaping patient reactions to new guidelines.""","""['Melissa R Partin', 'Sarah E Lillie', 'Katie M White', 'Timothy J Wilt', 'Kristin L Chrouser', 'Brent C Taylor', 'Diana J Burgess']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""['Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Testing and referral patterns in the years surrounding the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'Reactions to Recommendations and Evidence About Prostate Cancer Screening Among White and Black Male Veterans.']"""

Consequently the identification and quantification of differentially spliced transcripts are pivotal for transcriptome analysis. However, how these diversified isoforms are spliced during genomic transcription and protein expression and what biological factors might influence the regulation of this are still required for further exploration. The advances in next-generation sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-seq) have enabled us to survey gene expression and splicing more accurately. We have introduced a novel computational method, graph-based exon-skipping scanner (GESS), for de novo detection of skipping event sites from raw RNA-seq reads without prior knowledge of gene annotations, as well as for determining the dominant isoform generated from such sites. We have applied our method to publicly available RNA-seq data in GM12878 and K562 cells from the ENCODE consortium, and integrated other sequencing-based genomic data to investigate the impact of splicing activities, transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic histone modifications on splicing outcomes.

Most insights into the functional role of EZH2 in prostate cancer have been gained using cell lines and EZH2 inactivation studies. However, the question remains whether overexpression of EZH2 can initiate prostate tumourigenesis or drive tumour progression. Appropriate transgenic mouse models that are required to answer such questions are lacking. We developed one such transgenic mouse model for conditional overexpression of Ezh2. In this transgene, Ezh2 and Luciferase are transcribed from a single open reading frame. The latter gene enables intravital bioluminescent imaging of tissues expressing this transgene, allowing the detection of tumour outgrowth and potential metastatic progression over time. Prostate-specific Ezh2 overexpression by crossbreeding with Probasin-Cre mice led to neoplastic prostate lesions at low incidence and with a long latency. Compounding a previously described Bmi1-transgene and Pten-deficiency prostate cancer mouse model with the Ezh2 transgene did not enhance tumour progression or drive metastasis formation. In conclusion, we here report the generation of a wildtype Ezh2 overexpression mouse model that allows for intravital surveillance of tissues with activated transgene. This model will be an invaluable tool for further unravelling the role of EZH2 in cancer.""","""['Martijn A J Koppens', 'Ellen Tanger', 'Karim Nacerddine', 'Bart Westerman', 'Ji-Ying Song', 'Maarten van Lohuizen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Transgenic Res""","""['Essential role for activation of the Polycomb group (PcG) protein chromatin silencing pathway in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Polycomb-group oncogenes EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are overexpressed in prostate cancer with adverse pathologic and clinical features.', 'Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer.', 'Multifaceted role of the polycomb-group gene EZH2 in hematological malignancies.', 'The EZH2 polycomb transcriptional repressor--a marker or mover of metastatic prostate cancer?', 'EZH2 and Endometrial Cancer Development: Insights from a Mouse Model.', 'CDK2-mediated site-specific phosphorylation of EZH2 drives and maintains triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Transgenic Animal Models to Visualize Cancer-Related Cellular Processes by Bioluminescence Imaging.', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer in the Postgenomic Era.']"""

We hypothesize that variation in activity of carotenoid cleavage enzymes, such as β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2), may alter the impact of dietary tomato and lycopene on prostate carcinogenesis and therefore examined this relationship in the TRAMP model. Starting at 3 weeks of age, TRAMP:Bco2+/+ and TRAMP:Bco2-/- mice were fed either AIN-93G control, or semipurified diets containing 10% tomato powder or 0.25% lycopene beadlets until 18 weeks of age. Both tomato- and lycopene-fed TRAMP:Bco2-/- mice had significantly greater serum concentrations of total, 5-cis, other cis, and all-trans lycopene than TRAMP:Bco2+/+ mice. Tomato- and lycopene-fed mice had a lower incidence of prostate cancer compared with the control-fed mice. Although Bco2 genotype alone did not significantly change prostate cancer outcome in the control AIN-93G-fed mice, the abilities of lycopene and tomato feeding to inhibit prostate carcinogenesis were significantly attenuated by the loss of Bco2 (Pinteraction = 0.0004 and 0.0383, respectively). Overall, dietary tomato and lycopene inhibited the progression of prostate cancer in TRAMP in a Bco2 genotype-specific manner, potentially implicating the anticancer activity of lycopene cleavage products. This study suggests that genetic variables impacting carotenoid metabolism and accumulation can impact anticancer activity and that future efforts devoted to understanding the interface between tomato carotenoid intake, host genetics, and metabolism will be necessary to clearly elucidate their interactive roles in human prostate carcinogenesis.

The authors present continued development of a dual-modality thermobrachytherapy (TB) seed, investigating its capabilities in delivering prescribed hyperthermia to realistic deep-seated targets.  Methods:   The TB seed is based on the ubiquitous low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy permanent implant. Heat is generated by incorporating a ferromagnetic core within the seed and placing the patient in an oscillating external magnetic field, producing eddy currents within the core and hence Joule heating. A strategically selected Curie temperature results in thermal self-regulation. The magnetic and thermal properties of the TB seed were studied experimentally by means of seed prototypes placed in a tissue-mimicking phantom and heated with an industrial induction heater, as well as computationally in the finite element analysis solver COMSOL Multiphysics. Patient-specific seed distributions derived from LDR permanent prostate implants previously conducted at their institution were modeled in COMSOL to evaluate their ability to adequately cover a defined target volume and to overcome the loss of heat due to blood perfusion within tissue. The calculated temperature distributions were analyzed by generating temperature-volume histograms, which were used to quantify coverage and temperature homogeneity for varied blood perfusion rates, seed Curie temperatures, and thermal power production rates. Use of additional hyperthermia-only (HT-only) seeds in unused spots within the implantation needles was investigated, as was an increase in these seeds' core size to increase their power. The impact of the interseed attenuation and scatter (ISA) effect on radiation dose distributions of this seed was also quantified by Monte Carlo studies in the software package Monte Carlo N-Particle Version 5.  Results:   Increasing the power production of the seeds, as well as increasing their Curie point, would increase the maximum blood perfusion rate that a given seed distribution could overcome to obtain an acceptable temperature distribution. However, this would also increase the maximum temperatures generated at the seed surfaces. Auxiliary HT-only seeds serve to improve the temperature uniformity within the target, as well as decrease the seed power generation requirements. Both an increase in their core size and an increase in both seed types' Curie temperatures enhance the resulting temperature coverage. The interseed and scatter effect caused by both the TB and HT-only seeds was found to reduce the dose to 90% of the target volume (D90) by a factor of 1.10 ± 0.02.  Conclusions:   A systematic approach of combining LDR prostate brachytherapy with hyperthermia is described, and its ability to provide sufficient and uniform temperature distributions in realistic patient-specific implants evaluated. A combination of TB and HT-only seeds may be used to produce a uniform temperature distribution in a defined target. Various modeled changes to their design, such as optimization of their Curie temperature, improve their ability to overcome the thermal effects of blood perfusion. The enhanced ISA of the TB and HT-only seeds must be taken into account for dose calculations, but is manageable.""","""['Gregory Warrell', 'Diana Shvydka', 'E Ishmael Parsai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric and thermal properties of a newly developed thermobrachytherapy seed with ferromagnetic core for treatment of solid tumors.', 'Practical considerations for maximizing heat production in a novel thermobrachytherapy seed prototype.', 'Monte Carlo investigation of I-125 interseed attenuation for standard and thinner seeds in prostate brachytherapy with phantom validation using a MOSFET.', 'A review on permanent implants for prostate brachytherapy with comparison between stranded and loose seeds.', 'Thermal therapy of prostate cancer using magnetic nanoparticles.', 'Interstitial magnetic thermotherapy dosimetry based on shear wave magnetomotive optical coherence elastography.']"""

Furthermore, the poorer survival for ovarian cancer was consistent with a higher FIGO stage and a greater proportion of more aggressive tumors of the serous type. The better survival for patients with a family history of breast and prostate cancer may be due to medical surveillance of family members.

It is unlikely, however, that viral tumor cell killing alone could produce meaningful, durable clinical responses, as clinically suitable 'oncolytic' viruses are severely attenuated and their spread and propagation are opposed by host immunity. Thus, a more propitious event in this context is the innate antiviral response to intratumoral virus administration, in particular for recruiting durable adaptive immune effector responses. It may represent a double-edged sword, as innate immune activation may eliminate infected tumor cells early, intercept viral spread and block any meaningful therapeutic response. The innate response to viral infection of tumors may be very different from that in non-malignant target tissues, owing to the unusual composition/tissue properties of tumor stroma. In this work, we report investigations of the innate immune response to the oncolytic poliovirus recombinant, PVSRIPO, in two mouse xenotransplantation models for breast and prostate cancer. Our observations indicate short-term virus persistence in infected tumors and virus recovery indicative of modest intratumoral propagation and persistence. Yet, a powerful innate inflammatory response coincided with chemokine induction and myeloid cell infiltration into tumors that was, interestingly, dominated by neutrophils. The combined effect of PVSRIPO tumor infection and the innate response it elicits was significant tumor regression in both models.""","""['Eda K Holl', 'Michael C Brown', 'David Boczkowski', 'Megan A McNamara', 'Daniel J George', 'Darell D Bigner', 'Matthias Gromeier', 'Smita K Nair']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Engineered Oncolytic Poliovirus PVSRIPO Subverts MDA5-Dependent Innate Immune Responses in Cancer Cells.', 'Cytotoxic and immunogenic mechanisms of recombinant oncolytic poliovirus.', 'Recombinant Poliovirus for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Oncolytic immunotherapy through tumor-specific translation and cytotoxicity of poliovirus.', 'Oncolytic targeting of androgen-sensitive prostate tumor by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): consequences of deficient interferon-dependent antiviral defense.', 'Intratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T-cell recall coordinates antitumor CD8+ T cells and eosinophils.', 'Investigational Microbiological Therapy for Glioma.', 'Oncolyic Virotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Lighting a Fire in Winter.', 'Multimodality analysis confers a prognostic benefit of a T-cell infiltrated tumor microenvironment and peripheral immune status in patients with melanoma.', 'The Role of Neutrophils in Oncolytic Orf Virus-Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

Objective:   To determine downstream effects on practice patterns in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Procedural volumes of certifying and recertifying urologists from 2009 through 2016 were evaluated for variation in prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) volume. Trends were confirmed using the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The study included a representative sample of urologists across practice settings and nationally representative sample of all RP discharges. We obtained operative case logs from the American Board of Urology and identified urologists performing at least 1 prostate biopsy (n = 5173) or RP (n = 3748), respectively.  Exposures:   The 2012 USPSTF recommendation against routine population-wide prostate-specific antigen screening.  Main outcomes and measures:   Change in median biopsy and RP volume per urologist and national procedural volume.  Results:   Following the USPSTF recommendation, median biopsy volume per urologist decreased from 29 to 21 (interquartile range [IQR}, 12-34; P < .001). After adjusting for physician and practice characteristics, biopsy volume decreased by 28.7% following 2012 (parameter estimate, -0.25; SE, 0.03; P < .001). Similarly, following the USPSTF recommendation, median RP volume per urologist decreased from 7 (IQR, 3-15) to 6 (IQR, 2-12) (P < .001), and in adjusted analyses, RP volume decreased 16.2% (parameter estimate, -0.15; SE, 0.05; P = .003).

Methods and results:   A retrospective cohort study included 777 men with PCa diagnosed between 1995 and 2002 in north-eastern Italy and followed up to 2013. A validated food frequency questionnaire assessed the usual diet in the 2 years before PCa diagnosis, including detailed fruit and vegetables consumption. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of death with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Fine-Gray models. PCa patients with a consumption of both fruit and vegetables above the median showed a higher 15-year overall survival probability than those with lower intakes (71% versus 58%, p = 0.04; HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.93).

BCR was defined as two consecutive PSA values >0.2 ng/mL and the PSA measurements were log2-transformed. One third of the data was reserved for independent validation. Models were first fitted to the post-surgery PSA measurements using cross-validation. Major trends were then captured using linear mixed-effect models and a predictive generalized linear model effectively identified early trends connected to BCR. The model generalized for BCR prediction to the validation set with ROC-AUC of 83.6% and 95.1% for the 1 and 3 year follow-up censoring, respectively. A web-based tool was developed to facilitate its use. Longitudinal trends of u-PSA did not display major discrepancies from those of t-PSA. The results support that u-PSA provides useful information for predicting BCR after RP.

The gold standard for its diagnosis is morphological examination; at the same time the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and benign conditions that are able to mimic the malignancies is tremendously difficult in a number of cases, this being so, the hyperdiagnosis rate of HGPIN requiring mandatory repeat biopsy is as high as 24%. The currently available differential diagnostic panel of antibodies is imperfect, which necessitates a search for novel markers.  Aim:   to estimate the diagnostic and prognostic value of the expression of PTOV1, APOD, and EPHA4 in prostatic neoplasias.  Material and methods:   A total of 90 samples from prostate cancer patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy were examined. The presence of adenocarcinoma and HGPIN was verified by immunohistochemical tests using antibodies to AMACR (P504S) and high molecular weight cytokeratin 34βE12 in serial sections. The latter were also used to immunohistochemically analyze the expression of PTOV1, APOD, and EPHA4.  Results:   APOD expression was noted in 76% of cases of both adenocarcinomas and HGPIN, in 4% in only cancer, and in 7% in only HGPIN. All the study samples showed a considerable decrease in PTOV1 expression in cancer and HGPIN compared to morphologically normal glands. Three samples also exhibited no PTOV1 expression in a number of morphologically normal glands. No difference was found in the expression of EPHA4 in morphologically normal glands, HGPIN, or cancer.  Conclusion:   The high rate of APOD expression in HGPIN and cancer, as well as the absence of its expression in the vast majority of morphologically normal glands allows the use of this protein as an additional marker in the differential diagnosis of prostatic neoplasms. The emerging trends in the difference of PTOV1 expression in morphologically normal prostate tissue, HGPIN, and cancer call for further investigations with a larger sample.""","""['D O Allina', 'Yu Yu Andreeva', 'L E Zavalishina', 'L V Moskvina', 'G A Frank']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arkh Patol""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of prostate tumour overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) of the prostate: additional evidence linking (AAH) to adenocarcinoma.', 'Is there a role for prostate tumour overexpressed-1 in the diagnosis of HGPIN and of prostatic adenocarcinoma?

Unfortunately, due to limited availability of material and difficulties with protocols validation, primary models are rarely implemented into laboratory practice.We have compared protocols for primary cultures, differing in media components and plate coatings. In terms of culture establishment, application of Geltrex® coating demonstrated equal efficiency to feeder layer (83% compared with 72% successfully established breast and 80% compared with 80% prostate tumour specimens), yet it was substantially less complicated and easier to validate. Both Geltrex® coating and tissue-specific primary cell medium were permanently required to successfully maintain primary epithelial prostate cancer cells (PEPCs) in culture. In case of primary epithelial breast cancer cells (PEBCs), collagen I coating enabled to obtain comparable number of passages to Geltrex® coating (P=0.438). Commercial primary cell media demonstrated lower efficiency than tissue-specific ones (PEPCs-5 compared with 8 and PEBCs-6 compared with 9 passages). Interestingly, both analysed tumour types were unsusceptible to induction of culture lifespan extension when transduced with SV40LT, BMI-1 or hEST2 genes, commonly applied as potential immortalizing agents.In conclusion, the approach based on extracellular matrix reconstitution and tissue-specific primary cell media is easy to validate and provides in vitro expansion sufficient for analytical purposes (approximately 8 passages).

Results were compared with ETS-related gene status and deletions of PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15. MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 expression was detectable in 89.5%, 85.4% and 85.0% of cancers and was particularly strong in cancers with advanced pathological tumor stage (P < 0.0001 each), high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001 each), nodal metastasis (P ≤ 0.0083) and early biochemical recurrence (P < 0.0001). High levels of MMR gene expression paralleled features of genetic instability, such as the number of genomic deletions per cancer; strong expression of all three MMR genes was found in 24%, 29%, 30%, 33% and 42% of cancers with no, one, two, three or four to five deletions (P < 0.0001). The prognostic value of the analyzed MMR genes was largely driven by the subset of cancers lacking ERG fusion (P < 0.0001), while the prognostic impact of MMR gene overexpression was only marginal in ERG-positive cancers. Multivariate analyses suggested an independent prognostic relevance of MMR genes in ERG-negative prostate cancers when compared with prognostic parameters available at the time of initial biopsy.

Alternative models informed by survivors' preferences are urgently needed. It is unknown if follow-up preferences differ by cancer type. We conducted the first study to assess British cancer survivors' follow-up preferences, and the first anywhere to compare the preferences of survivors from different cancers.  Methods:   A discrete choice experiment questionnaire was mailed to 1201 adults in Northeast Scotland surviving melanoma, breast, prostate or colorectal cancer. Preferences and trade-offs for attributes of cancer follow-up were explored, overall and by cancer site.  Results:   668 (56.6%) recipients (132 melanoma, 213 breast, 158 prostate, 165 colorectal) responded. Cancer survivors had a strong preference to see a consultant during a face-to-face appointment when receiving cancer follow-up. However, cancer survivors appeared willing to accept follow-up from specialist nurses, registrars or GPs provided that they are compensated by increased continuity of care, dietary advice and one-to-one counselling. Longer appointments were also valued. Telephone and web-based follow-up and group counselling, were not considered desirable. Survivors of colorectal cancer and melanoma would see any alternative provider for greater continuity, whereas breast cancer survivors wished to see a registrar or specialist nurse, and prostate cancer survivors, a general practitioner.  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors may accept non-consultant follow-up if compensated with changes elsewhere. Care continuity was sufficient compensation for most cancers. Given practicalities, costs and the potential to develop continuous care, specialist nurse-led cancer follow-up may be attractive.""","""['Peter Murchie', 'Patricia F Norwood', 'Marta Pietrucin-Materek', 'Terry Porteous', 'Philip C Hannaford', 'Mandy Ryan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""[""Cancer survivors' preference for follow-up care providers: a cross-sectional study from the population-based PROFILES-registry."", 'Preferences of gastric cancer survivors for follow-up care-a multicenter discrete choice experiment study.', ""Eliciting gastric cancer survivors' preferences for follow-up services: a discrete choice experiment protocol."", ""Survivors' preferences for the organization and delivery of supportive care after treatment: An integrative review."", 'Improving the referral process for familial breast cancer genetic counselling: findings of three randomised controlled trials of two interventions.', 'Whether preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery for follow-up change over time?

Radiation may give rise to adverse effects, including second primary cancers. In view of the divergent results of previous studies, the present study evaluated the risk of second primary cancer following RT in all randomized RT rectal cancer trials conducted in Sweden and in the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR).  Methods:   Patients included in five randomized trials and the SCRCR were linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry. Cox regression models estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of second primary cancer among patients who received RT compared with those who did not.  Results:   A total of 13 457 patients were included in this study; 7024 (52·2 per cent) received RT and 6433 (47·8 per cent) had surgery alone. Overall, no increased risk of second primary cancer was observed with RT (HR 1·03; 95 per cent c.i. 0·92 to 1·15), independently of follow-up time and location within or outside of the irradiated volume. In the randomized trials, with longer follow-up (maximum 31 years), a slight increase was observed outside of (HR 1·33, 1·01 to 1·74) but not within (HR 1·11, 0·73 to 1·67) the irradiated volume. Irradiated men had a lower risk of prostate cancer than those treated with surgery alone (HR 0·68, 0·51 to 0·91).

Materials and Methods All rat experiments were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction array profiling was used to identify candidate microRNA biomarkers in a rat solid tumor cell line. Rats subcutaneously grafted with these cells were randomly assigned among three pulsed focused ultrasound treatment groups: (a) local tissue liquefaction via boiling histotripsy, (b) tissue permeabilization via inertial cavitation, and (c) mild (<10°C) heating of tissue, as well as a sham-treated control group. Blood specimens were drawn immediately prior to treatment and serially over 24 hours afterward. Plasma microRNA was quantified with reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and statistical significance was determined with one-way analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests), followed by the Dunn multiple-comparisons test. Results After tissue liquefaction and cavitation treatments (but not mild heating), plasma quantities of candidate biomarkers increased significantly (P value range, <.0001 to .04) relative to sham-treated controls. A threefold to 32-fold increase occurred within 15 minutes after initiation of pulsed focused ultrasound tumor treatment, and these increases persisted for 3 hours. Histologic examination confirmed complete liquefaction of the targeted tumor area with boiling histotripsy, in addition to areas of petechial hemorrhage and tissue disruption by means of cavitation-based treatment.

The introduction of robotic assistance has the potential to improve surgical outcomes and reduce the steep learning curve associated with conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The purpose of this video is to demonstrate the early retrograde release of the neurovascular bundle without open the endopelvic fascia during RAP.  Materials and methods:   A 51-year old male, presenting histological diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6 (3+3), in 4 cores of 12, with an initial PSA=3.41ng/dl and the digital rectal examination demonstrating a prostate with hardened nodule in the right lobe of the prostate base (clinical stage T2a). Surgical treatment with the robot-assisted technique was offered as initial therapeutic option and the critical technical point was the early retrograde release of the neurovascular bundle with endopelvic fascia preservation, during radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The operative time was of 89 minutes, blood loss was 100ml. No drain was left in the peritoneal cavity. The patient was discharged within 24 hours. There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. The pathological evaluation revealed prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6, with free surgical margins and seminal vesicles free of neoplastic involvement (pathologic stage T2a). At 3-month-follow-up, the patient lies with undetectable PSA, continent and potent.

Its regulation, receptor and mechanism of action remain unclear. B7-H3 protein expression correlates with prostate cancer outcomes, and humanized monoclonal antibodies (that is, enoblituzumab) are currently being investigated for therapeutic use. Here we used genomic expression data to examine the relationship between B7-H3 mRNA expression and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostatectomy tissue from 2781 patients were profiled using the Affymetrix HuEx 1.0 ST microarray. Pairwise comparisons were used to identify significant associations between B7-H3 expression and clinicopathologic variables, and survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of B7-H3. Pearson's correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationship of B7-H3 expression with molecular subtypes and individual transcripts. Androgen receptor (AR) occupancy at the B7-H3 locus was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and androgen-dependent expression changes in B7-H3 was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in LNCaP cell lines. Oncomine was queried to evaluate B7-H3 expression in metastatic disease.  Results:   B7-H3 mRNA expression was positively associated with higher Gleason score (P<0.001), tumor stage (P<0.001), and castrate resistant metastatic disease (P<0.0001). High B7-H3 expression correlated with the development of metastasis and prostate cancer specific mortality, but this was not significant on multi-variable analysis. B7-H3 expression correlated with ERG-positive disease (r=0.99) and AR expression (r=0.36). ChIP revealed an AR-binding site upstream of B7-H3, and the presence of androgens decreased B7-H3 expression in LNCaP suggesting potential direct AR regulation. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated an association of B7-H3 with androgen signaling as well as immune regulatory pathways.  Conclusions:   Higher B7-H3 expression correlates with Gleason grade, prostate cancer stage and poor oncologic outcomes in prostatectomy cohorts.

In this paper, our objective was to investigate whether the immunohistochemical expression of the SOCS3 protein could represent an alternative method to molecular analysis for the individualization of aggressive prostate carcinoma.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the SOCS3 immunohistochemical expression in 65 patients undergoing biopsies at the Institute of Urology of our hospital between September 2011 and October 2011 (median age, 66.4 y; range, 50 to 73 y), and in 35 cases, a subset of 65 cases originally used for the immunohistochemical study, we studied the methylation status of the SOCS3 promoter.  Results:   We found that the percentage of cases with SOCS3 negativity (-) or with SOCS3 weak staining in <50% of the neoplastic glands (+/-) correlated to the worst prognosis in terms of the Gleason score (P=0.0001; Fisher's exact test), the pT stage (P=0.012; Fisher's exact test), and progression-free survival (P=0.0334; hazard ratio, 0.34; and 95% confidence interval, from 0.1261 to 0.9188). Moreover, some cases with an SOCS3 unmethylated pattern showed SOCS3-negative immunostaining (-) or SOCS3-negative glands with weak cytoplasmatic staining in <50% of the neoplastic glands (+/-).

Histones are the key factors in modulating gene accessibility to transcription factors and post-translational modification of the histone N-terminal tail including methylation is associated with either transcriptional activation (H3K4me2) or repression (H3K9me3). Furthermore, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K) signaling and the androgen receptor (AR) are the key determinants in prostate cancer development and progression. We recently showed that prostate-targeted nano-micelles loaded with PI3 K/p110beta specific inhibitor TGX221 blocked prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Our objective of this study was to determine the role of PI3 K signaling in histone methylation in prostate cancer, with emphasis on histone H3K4 methylation.  Methods:   PI3 K non-specific inhibitor LY294002 and p110beta-specific inhibitor TGX221 were used to block PI3 K/p110beta signaling. The global levels of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in prostate cancer cells and tissue specimens were evaluated by Western blot assay and immunohistochemical staining. A synthetic androgen R1881 was used to stimulate AR activity in prostate cancer cells. A castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) specific human tissue microarray (TMA) was used to assess the global levels of H3K4me2 methylation by immunostaining approach.  Results:   Our data revealed that H3K4me2 levels were significantly elevated after androgen stimulation. With RNA silencing and pharmacology approaches, we further defined that inhibition of PI3 K/p110beta activity through gene-specific knocking down and small chemical inhibitor TGX221 abolished androgen-stimulated H3K4me2 methylation. Consistently, prostate cancer-targeted delivery of TGX221 in vivo dramatically reduced the global levels of H3K4me2 as assessed by immunohistochemical staining on tissue section of mouse xenografts from CRPC cell lines 22RV1 and C4-2. Finally, immunostaining data revealed a strong H3K4me2 immunosignal in CRPC tissues compared to primary tumors and benign prostate tissues.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our results suggest that PI3 K/p110beta-dependent signaling is involved in androgen-stimulated H3K4me2 methylation in prostate cancer, which might be used as a novel biomarker for disease prognosis and targeted therapy.

Furthermore, serum free testosterone, which is the active form of testosterone, seems to correlate with intraprostatic testosterone. Here we compared free and total serum testosterone as predictors of survival free of castration resistance.  Methods:   Total testosterone (chemiluminescent assay, lower sensitivity 10 ng/dl) and free testosterone (analogue-ligand radioimmunoassay, lower sensitivity 0.05 pg/ml) were determined at 6 months of LHRH agonist treatment in a prospective cohort of 126 patients with prostate cancer. During a mean follow-up of 67 months (9-120), 75 (59.5%) events of castration-resistant progression were identified. Multivariate analysis and survival analysis according to total testosterone cutoffs of 50, 32, and 20 ng/dl, and free testosterone cutoffs of 1.7, 1.1, and 0.7 pg/ml were performed.  Results:   Metastatic spread was the most powerful predictor of castration resistance, HR: 2.09 (95%CI: 1.18-3.72), P = 0.012. Gleason score, baseline PSA and PSA at 6 months were also independents predictors, but not free and total testosterone. Stratified analysis was conducted on the basis of the status of metastatic diseases and free testosterone was found to be an independent predictor of survival free of castration resistance in the subgroup of patients without metastasis, HR: 2.12 (95%CI: 1.16-3.85), P = 0.014. The lowest threshold of free testosterone which showed significant differences was 1.7 pg/ml, P = 0.003.  Conclusions:   Free testosterone at 6 months of LHRH agonist treatment seems to be a better surrogate than total testosterone to predict castration resistance in no metastatic prostate cancer patients.

The consistent and huge growth in participation in the conferences and the diversity of the nations is a witness to the success of the organization thus far. The theme for the Tenth AORTIC International Conference on Cancer in Africa in Morocco in 2015 was ""Road map to Cancer Control in Africa"" and topics of discussion of paramount importance for low- and middle-income African countries included childhood cancers such as BL, cancers of the cervix, breast, and prostate; cancers associated with HIV-infection such as cervical, vulvar, and anal; as well as cancer care challenges associated with palliative care. The role of environmental factors that underlie some epigenetic changes in some of the cancers was emphasized. Oral and poster presentations from various parts of the continent indicate the growth of basic and translational science of cancer in the region, with studies revealing regional diversity in the frequencies of the triple-negative breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, HCC, and Burkitt's lymphoma. There was a sign that Africa is trying to keep pace with the paradigm shift and focusing on translational medicine. This was shown by suggestions for application of genome-wide association studies, new generation sequencing, as well as the evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms that may be responsible for variable susceptibility in some of the prevalent cancers in people of African descent.

The tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in facilitating metastasis. Here, we investigated the structure and function of an ECM that facilitates prostate cancer metastasis by comparing orthotopic tumors that frequently metastasize to poorly metastatic subcutaneous tumors.Experimental Design: Both tumors were derived from a human prostate cancer PC3 cell line engineered to fluoresce under hypoxia. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used to characterize collagen 1 (Col1) fiber patterns in the xenografts as well as in human samples. MRI was used to determine albumin-Gd-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate (alb-GdDTPA) transport through the ECM using a saturation recovery MR method combined with fast T1 SNAPSHOT-FLASH imaging. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) were also quantified in these tumors.Results: Significant structural and functional differences were identified in the prometastatic orthotopic tumor ECM compared to the less metastatic subcutaneous tumor ECM. The significantly higher number of CAFs in orthotopic tumors may explain the higher Col1 fiber volumes in these tumors. In vivo, alb-GdDTPA pooling was significantly elevated in metastatic orthotopic tumors, consistent with the increased Col1 fibers.Conclusions: Developing noninvasive MRI indices of macromolecular transport, together with characterization of Col1 fiber patterns and CAFs can assist in stratifying prostate cancers for aggressive treatments or active surveillance. These results highlight the role of CAFs in supporting or creating aggressive cancers, and the importance of depleting CAFs to prevent metastatic dissemination in prostate cancer.

With data available for a single-institution cohort with long follow-up, an investigation was undertaken into rectal dose-volume effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after deformably-registering each phase of a combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)/high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy prostate treatment.  Methods:   One hundred and eighteen patients received EBRT in 23 fractions of 2 Gy and HDR (TG43 algorithm) in 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy. Results for the Late Effects of Normal Tissues - Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic toxicity assessments were available with a median follow-up of 72 months. The HDR CT was deformably-registered to the EBRT CT. Doses were corrected for dose fractionation. Rectum dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were calculated in two ways. (1) Distribution-adding: parameters were calculated after the EBRT dose distribution was 3D-summed with the registered HDR dose distribution. (2) Parameter-adding: the EBRT DVH parameters were added to HDR DVH parameters. Logistic regressions and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to correlate parameters with late peak toxicity (dichotomised at grade 1 or 2).  Results:   The 48-80, 40-63 and 49-55 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding, urgency/tenesmus and stool frequency respectively. Additionally, urgency/tenesmus and anorectal pain were associated with the 25-26 Gy and 44-48 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding respectively. Parameter-adding also indicated the low-mid dose region was significantly correlated with stool frequency and proctitis.  Conclusions:   This study confirms significant dose-histogram effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after including deformable registration to combine phases of EBRT/HDR prostate cancer treatment. The findings from distribution-adding were in most cases consistent with those from parameter-adding. The mid-high dose range and near maximum doses were important for rectal bleeding. The distribution-adding mid-high dose range was also important for stool frequency and urgency/tenesmus.

Aim of the current study was to compare functional and oncologic outcomes of high-intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation of the prostate to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in the management of unilateral PCa.  Materials:   Fifty-five men with unilateral, clinically localized PCa underwent HIFU hemiablation of the affected prostatic lobe between 2007 and 2015. All patients were found to have unilateral disease on the basis on full concordance between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-guided biopsies. These patients were matched 1:1 with patients who underwent RALP for PCa in which pT2a-b disease (unilateral) was found on final pathologic analysis. Matching criteria were Gleason score, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and cT stage. Treatment failure was defined as the need for salvage external beam radiotherapy or systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) due to disease progression. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were constructed to assess differences in salvage treatment free survival across surgical techniques.  Results:   Matching was effective with no significant differences across the two groups, although men treated with HIFU were older (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 36 months (interquartile range 16-56). HIFU was associated to better and faster recovery of continence, with most men (82%) showing no signs of urinary incontinence even right after surgery. Moreover, the risk of de novo erectile dysfunction was significantly lower after HIFU. No significant difference was found in the need for salvage external beam radiation therapy or ADT across the two surgical approaches: 7/55 men underwent salvage therapy in the HIFU vs 6/55 in the RALP group (p = 0.76). Nonetheless, seven more patients in the HIFU arm required a complementary treatment on the contralateral lobe during follow-up, after developing a contralateral PCa. No patient died of PCa on follow-up, while six men died of other causes (five HIFU vs one RALP, p = 0.11).  Conclusion:   In this matched pair analysis, HIFU hemiablation was comparable to RALP in controlling localized unilateral PCa, with no significant differences in the need for salvage therapies. HIFU was also associated to significantly better functional outcomes. Accurate patient selection remains vital, and larger prospective trials are needed to confirm our findings.""","""['Simone Albisinni', 'Fouad Aoun', 'Simon Bellucci', 'Ibrahim Biaou', 'Ksenija Limani', 'Eric Hawaux', 'Alexandre Peltier', 'Roland van Velthoven']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Targeted Hemiablation for Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Evaluation of Oncologic and Functional Outcomes.', 'Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients.', 'Focal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound of Unilateral Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multicentric Hemiablation Study of 111 Patients.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.', 'Cancer control and functional outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'High-Intensity Focused-Ultrasound Focal Therapy Versus Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparison of Oncological and Functional Outcomes in Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer - Current status.', 'A systematic review of outcomes after thermal and nonthermal partial prostate ablation.', 'The comparison of survival between active surveillance or watchful waiting and focal therapy for low-risk prostate cancer: a real-world study from the SEER database.']"""

Material and methods:   Patients were assessed on the basis of DR/P criteria. Predictors of DR/P were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards.  Results:   The median DR/P free time was 16.5 months. DR/P was detected in 30 out of 84 cases (35.7%). In DR/P cases, the median prostate volume (PV) was significantly lower (34.7 vs. 42.7 ml) and the percentage of cases with 2 or 3 vs. 1 initial biopsy positive cores (BPC) was significantly higher (36.7 vs. 7.4%). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that PV (OR 0.9; p = 0.021) and initial n >1 BPC (OR 9.8; p = 0.001) were independent predictors of DR/P. By Cox multivariate proportional hazards, only n >1 BPC predicted early DR/P (hazard ratio 3.1; p = 0.003).

Decision aids can facilitate the process of shared decision making. Implicit in this approach is the idea that physicians understand which elements of treatment matter to patients. Little formal work exists to guide physicians or developers of decision aids in identifying these attributes. We use a mixed-methods technique adapted from marketing science, the 'Voice of the Patient', to describe and identify treatment elements of value for men with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 men treated for prostate cancer in the urology clinic of the West Los Angeles Veteran Affairs Medical Center. We used a qualitative analysis to generate themes in patient narratives, and a quantitative approach, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, to identify attributes of treatment that were most relevant to patients making decisions about prostate cancer.  Results:   We identified five 'traditional' prostate cancer treatment attributes: sexual dysfunction, bowel problems, urinary problems, lifespan, and others' opinions. We further identified two novel treatment attributes: a treatment's ability to validate a sense of proactivity and the need for an incision (separate from risks of surgery).  Conclusions:   Application of a successful marketing technique, the 'Voice of the Customer', in a clinical setting elicits non-obvious attributes that highlight unique patient decision-making concerns.

Men's health supplements (MHSs), which we define as supplements that are specifically marketed with the terms men's health and prostate health (or similar permutations), are often mislabeled as having potential anticancer benefits.  Objective:   We evaluated the effects of MHSs on patient outcomes and toxicities in patients who were undergoing definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for localized prostate cancer.  Design:   This retrospective analysis included patients who were being treated at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center and consented to have information stored in a prospective database. MHSs were queried online. Outcome measures were freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) (biochemical failure was defined with the use of the prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2-ng/mL definition), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) as well as toxicities. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, Fine and Gray competing-risk regression (to adjust for patient and lifestyle factors), and Cox models were used.  Results:   From 2001 to 2012, 2207 patients were treated with IMRT with a median dose of 78 Gy, and a median follow-up of 46 mo. Of these patients, 43% were low risk, 37% were intermediate risk, and 20% were high risk; 10% used MHSs. MHSs contained a median of 3 identifiable ingredients (range: 0-78 ingredients). Patients who were taking an MHS compared with those who were not had improved 5-y OS (97% compared with 92%, respectively; P = 0.01), but there were no differences in the FFBF (94% compared with 89%, respectively; P = 0.12), FFDM (96% compared with 97%, respectively; P = 0.32), or CSS (100% compared with 99%, respectively; P = 0.22). The unadjusted association between MHS use and improved OS was attenuated after adjustment for patient lifestyle factors and comorbidities. There was no difference in toxicities between the 2 groups (late-grade 3-4 genitourinary <3%; gastrointestinal <4%).

Skeletal- related events (SREs) deteriorate overall performance status and reduce quality of life. However, guidelines for early detection and management are limited. This study includes a survey of the prevalence of bone metastasis in cases with common cancers in Thailand as well as a focus on survival patterns and SREs.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using a database of the Chiang Mai Cancer Registry and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Registry of the OLARN Center, Chiang Mai University. The prevalence of bone metastasis from each type of primary cancer was noted and time-to-event analysis was performed to estimate cancer survival rates after bone metastasis.  Results:   There were 29,447 cases of the ten most common cancers in Thailand, accounting for 82.2% of the entire cancer registry entries during the study period. Among those cases, there were 2,263 with bone metastases, accounting for 7.68% of entries. Bone metastasis from lung, liver, breast, cervix and prostate are common in the Thai population, accounting for 83.4% of all positive cases. The median survival time of all was 6 months. Of the bone metastases, 48.9% required therapeutic intervention, including treatment of spinal cord and nerve root compression, pathological fractures, and bone pain.  Conclusions:   The frequency of the top five types of bone metastasis in Thailand were different from the frequencies in other countries, but corresponded to the relative prevalence of the cancers in Thailand and osteophilic properties of each cancer. The results of this study support the establishment of country specific guidelines for primary cancer identification with skeletal lesions of unknown origin. In addition, further clinical studies of the top five bone metastases should be performed to develop guidelines for optimal patient management during palliative care.""","""['Areerak Phanphaisarn', 'Jayantorn Patumanond', 'Jongkolnee Settakorn', 'Parunya Chaiyawat', 'Jeerawan Klangjorhor', 'Dumnoensun Pruksakorn']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The cost of treatment of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer.', 'Payer costs for inpatient treatment of pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression among patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis secondary to prostate or breast cancer.', 'Bone metastasis and skeletal-related events in patients with solid cancer: A Korean nationwide health insurance database study.', 'Clinical features of metastatic bone disease and risk of skeletal morbidity.', 'Clinical, economic and humanistic burdens of skeletal-related events associated with bone metastases.', 'Update on Prevalence of Pain in Patients with Cancer 2022: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Development of a web-based calculator to predict three-month mortality among patients with bone metastases from cancer of unknown primary: An internally and externally validated study using machine-learning techniques.', 'Holistic Approach to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Tumor Metastases to the Spine.', 'Epidemiology of spinal metastases, metastatic epidural spinal cord compression and pathologic vertebral compression fractures in patients with solid tumors: A systematic review.', 'Development of a clinical diagnostic tool to differentiate multiple myeloma from bone metastasis in patients with destructive bone lesions (MM-BM DDx).']"""

Objective:   We therefore performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare and create hierarchies for efficacy and safety of TUPR and laser surgeries for BPH.  Materials and methods:   We searched for reports of RCTs published up to April 25, 2015. After methodological quality assessment and data extraction, we performed an NMA to compare TURP and laser surgeries for BPH.  Results:   We ranked the treatments of TURP and laser surgeries for BPH.

For Qmax at 6 and 12 months, HoLEP ranked the first-best; for operative time it was TURP; for cathedral removal time, diode laser enucleation of the prostate (DiLEP) ranked the first-best.  Conclusions:   Although TURP is considered the gold standard for treating BPH, it is not better in terms of efficacy and safety compared with the laser surgery.

Patients with this disease profile who could benefit from treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were selected and their responses to these techniques were rated.  Materials and methods:   This was a prospective, controlled, unicentric study, involving 46 consecutive patients from our centre who presented biochemical relapse after adjuvant, salvage or radical treatment with external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. After initial tests (bone scintigraphy, CT, pelvic MRI), 35 patients with oligometastases or without them were selected. 11 patients with multiple metastases were excluded from the study. WB-DW-MRI and choline-PET/CT was then performed on each patient within 1 week. The results were interpreted by specialists in nuclear medicine and MRI. If they were candidates for treatment with ablative SBRT (SABR), they were then evaluated every three months with both tests.  Results:   Choline-PET/CT detected lesions in 16 patients that were not observable using WB-DW-MRI. The results were consistent in seven patients and in three cases, a lesion was observed using WB-DW-MRI that was not detected with choline-PET/CT. The Kappa value obtained was 0.133 (p = 0.089); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of WB-DW-MRI were estimated at 44.93, 64.29, 86.11, and 19.15%, respectively. For choline-PET/CT patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.10, 58.33, 93.06, and 77.78%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Choline-PET/CT has a high global sensitivity while WB-DW-MRI has a high specificity, and so they are complementary techniques.

Despite its anatomical similarity and close proximity to the seminal vesicle, the prognostic significance of vas deferens invasion (VDI) by PCa has not been elucidated. For these reasons, we investigated the impact of VDI on the oncological outcome of pT3b PCa in association with SVI.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3359 patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy at our institution between January 2000 and December 2014 for PCa. Patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment (radiation, androgen deprivation therapy, or both) and those without adequate medical records were excluded. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), and a Cox regression model was used to test the influence of VDI on biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Of 350 patients with pathologically confirmed SVI (pT3b), 87 (24.9%) had VDI, while the remaining 263 patients (75.1%) had isolated SVI. Compared with SVI patients without VDI, SVI patients with VDI were noted to have a significantly worse 5-year BCRFS (25.1 vs. 17.1%, respectively). VDI was a significant predictor of BCR in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.90; p = 0.039).  Conclusions:   Our results shows that the prognosis of PCa with SVI might be further stratified by VDI status, thus suggesting the role of VDI either as a surrogate for poor prognosis or as a determinant for adjuvant therapy.""","""['Won Sik Jang', 'Cheol Yong Yoon', 'Ki Hong Kim', 'Yong Jin Kang', 'Su-Jin Shin', 'Nam Hoon Cho', 'Joo Yong Lee', 'Kang Su Cho', 'Won Sik Ham', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Young Deuk Choi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Contemporary survival results and the role of radiation therapy in patients with node negative seminal vesicle invasion following radical prostatectomy.', 'Association between Seminal Vesicle Invasion and Prostate Cancer Detection Location after Transrectal Systemic Biopsy among Men Who Underwent Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Does bilateral seminal vesicle invasion at radical prostatectomy predict worse prognosis than unilateral invasion among patients with pT3b prostate cancers?', 'Seminal vesicle biopsies: an useful staging procedure-exposure of seminal vesicle biopsies protocol and review of the literature.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Bilateral Seminal Vesicle Invasion Is Not Associated with Worse Outcomes in Locally Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Vas deferens infiltration by prostate cancer on prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted 18F-DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography: A unique visual pattern.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer with seminal vesicle involvement (T3b): A multicentric retrospective analysis.']"""

We examined their ability to predict OCM in individuals treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiation (EBRT) androgen deprivation (ADT) or observation. We postulated that these variables are not sufficient to explain OCM and LE patterns according to different treatment types.  Patients and methods:   We relied on the SEER-Medicare database from 1991 to 2009. Overall, 283,125 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer aged ≥66 years were treated with RP (15.5%), BT (13.9%), EBRT (21.4%), ADT alone (16.3%) or observation (32.8%). Cumulative incidence of OCM and LE was stratified by treatment type and adjusted for age and CCI. Competing risks regression was also used.  Results:   OCM rates vary according to treatment, despite age and CCI adjustment. In RP or BT patients, LE exceeds 10 years, regardless of age and CCI. Conversely, a 10-year LE is not reached by patients >74 years treated with observation or ADT. In OCM competing risks regression, age, CCI and treatment type achieved independent predictor status (all p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In patients with nmPCa, neither age nor CCI can accurately estimate OCM or LE in excess of 10 years. Primary treatment assignment is a strong determinant of OCM and LE, where RP and BT patients enjoy better OCM and LE rates than observation ADT or EBRT patients.

Aim:   The aim of the authors was to investigate the characteristics of malignancies associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients diagnozed between 2000 and 2015.  Method:   Data of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had other associated tumours were analysed using the Leukemia/Lymphoma Registry of the Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County, Hungary and patient records.  Results:   Between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015, 526 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were diagnosed. 95 patients of the 526 patients (18.06%) were diagnosed as having associated other tumours. In 48/95 patients (50.5%) the first diagnosed tumour was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in 23/95 patients (24.2%) the first recognized malignancy was the associated tumour, whereas in 24/95 patients (25.3%) synchron tumours were diagnosed. The number of patients with more than one associated tumour was 10/95 (10.5%). The total number of tumours was 107. The incidence of chronic lymphoid leukemia increased in the period between 2000 and 2015 as compared to the period between 1983 and 1999 (3.19 vs 5.65/100 000 person/year). The occurrence of associated malignancies increased as well (8.06% vs 18.06%). In addition to the most common tumours (colorectal, breast, lung, prostate), skin squamous cell carcinoma (17/95 patients; 17.9%) and melanoma (6/95 patients; 6.3%) also frequently occurred. The second malignancies were most frequently discovered after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and synchron tumours accounting for 78.5% (84/107) of all associated tumours. The incidence of second malignancies decreased 10 years after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Conclusions:   The possible reasons for the high frequency of other tumours associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are elderly age of patients, immunsuppressed state and, presumably, chemotherapy of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. During the follow up of patients the high risk for the development of associated tumours should be considered. Therapy of patients should be initiated when it is neccessary. Orv.

We set out to determine whether preoperative degarelix influenced surrogates of disease control in a randomized phase II study.Experimental Design: Thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to one of three different neoadjuvant arms: degarelix only, degarelix/bicalutamide, or LHRH agonist/bicalutamide. Treatments were given for 3 months before prostatectomy. Patients had localized prostate cancer and had chosen radical prostatectomy as primary treatment. The primary end point was treatment effect on intratumoral dihydrotestosterone levels.Results: Intratumoral DHT levels were higher in the degarelix arm than both the degarelix/bicalutamide and LHRH agonist/bicalutamide arms (0.87 ng/g vs. 0.26 ng/g and 0.23 ng/g, P < 0.01). No significant differences existed for other intratumoral androgens, such as testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Patients in the degarelix-only arm had higher AMACR levels on immunohistochemical analysis (P = 0.01). Serum FSH levels were lower after 12 weeks of therapy in both degarelix arms than the LHRH agonist/bicalutamide arm (0.55 and 0.65 vs. 3.65, P < 0.01), and inhibin B levels were lower in the degarelix/bicalutamide arm than the LHRH agonist/bicalutamide arm (82.14 vs. 126.67, P = 0.02).Conclusions: Neoadjuvant degarelix alone, compared with use of LHRH agonist and bicalutamide, is associated with higher levels of intratumoral dihydrotestosterone, despite similar testosterone levels.

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with high-risk primary prostate cancer underwent an integrated [18F]Fluciclovine PET/MRI exam before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Volumes-of-interest (VOIs) of selected organs (prostate, bladder, blood pool) and sub-glandular prostate structures (tumour, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), inflammation, healthy tissue) were delineated on T2-weighted MR images, using whole-mount histology samples as a reference. Three candidate windows for optimal PET imaging were identified based on the dynamic curves of the mean and maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively). The statistical significance of differences in SUV between VOIs were analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (p<0.05, adjusted for multiple testing).

Here, we have described in details the potential mechanisms by which SOX2 effects neoplastic characteristics in prostate cancer and investigated the consequences of simultaneous down-regulation of SOX2 and HH pathway in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells. Expression of SOX2 has been determined by qRT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry analyses; its functional role determined by gene knockdown using RNAi and over-expression via chemical activation in HaCaT, DU145 and PC-3 cells. Changes in level of cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis profiles were measured by MTT, FACS, chromatin condensation and scratch assays respectively. SOX2 was expressed in all the three cell lines and its inhibition reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Most importantly, when both SOX2 and HH pathway were targeted simultaneously, cell proliferation was greatly reduced, apoptotic cell population increased drastically and migration potential was reduced. Moreover, gene expression of EMT markers such as E-cadherin and apoptosis related Bcl-2 and Bax was also investigated wherein decrease in E-cadherin and Bcl-2 levels and increase in Bax expression further substantiating our claim.

Mean treatment differences in function were compared by race using risk-adjusted generalized estimating equations.  Results and limitations:   While all race/ethnic groups reported considerable declines in scores for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy (RP) when compared to active surveillance, African-American men reported a greater difference than white men did (adjusted difference-in-differences 8.4 points, 95% confidence interval 2.0-14.8; p=0.01). No difference in bother scores was noted and the overall proportion of explained variation attributable to race/ethnicity was relatively small in comparison to primary treatment and baseline function. No clinically significant racial variation was noted for the sexual, bowel, irritative voiding, or hormone domains. Limitations include the lack of well-established thresholds for clinical significance using the EPIC instrument.  Conclusion:   While these data demonstrate that incontinence at 1 yr after RP may be worse for African-American compared to white men, the difference appears to be modest overall. Treatment selection and baseline function explain a much greater proportion of the variation in function after treatment.  Patient summary:   We observed that the effect of treatment for prostate cancer on patient-reported function did not vary dramatically by race/ethnicity.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Using data on PCa characteristics, age, and comorbidity, a state transition model was created to estimate the probability of changes between predefined treatments to estimate transition from AS to WW.  Results and limitations:   Our estimates indicate that 48% of men with very low-risk PCa starting AS eventually changed to WW over a life course. This proportion increased with age at time of AS initiation. Within 10 yr from start of AS, 10% of men aged 55 yr and 50% of men aged 70 yr with no comorbidity at initiation changed to WW. Our prevalence simulation suggests that the number of men on WW who were previously on AS will eventually stabilise after 30 yr. A limitation is the limited information from clinical follow-up visits (eg, repeat biopsies).  Conclusions:   We estimated that changes from AS to WW become common among men with very low-risk PCa who are elderly. This potential change to WW should be discussed with men starting on AS. Moreover, our estimates may help in planning health care resources allocated to men on AS, as the transition to WW is associated with lower demands on outpatient resources.  Patient summary:   Changes from active surveillance to watchful waiting will become more common among men with very low-risk prostate cancer. These observations suggest that patients need to be informed about this potential change before they start on active surveillance.""","""['Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Hans Garmo', 'Lars Lindhagen', 'Ola Bratt', 'Pär Stattin', 'Jan Adolfsson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Active Surveillance: A Ten-year Journey.', 'Active Surveillance Versus Watchful Waiting for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Model to Inform Decisions.', 'Using Competing Risk of Mortality to Inform the Transition from Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance to Watchful Waiting.', 'The New Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with Watchful Waiting Database: Opportunities and Limitations.', 'Management of prostate cancer with indolent biological potential: from watchful waiting to active surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Long-term Outcomes Among Men Undergoing Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Sweden.', 'No significant difference in intermediate key outcomes in men with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer managed by active surveillance.', ""Factors that influence clinicians' decisions to decrease active surveillance monitoring frequency or transition to watchful waiting for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative study."", 'Long-term outcomes of active surveillance for clinically localized prostate cancer in a community-based setting: results from a prospective non-interventional study.', 'Noninvasive treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer in elderly patients-results of the HAROW study.']"""

Here, we report that the AR-repressed gene CCN3/NOV inhibits AR signaling and acts in a negative feedback loop to block AR function. Mechanistically, a cytoplasmic form of CCN3 interacted with the AR N-terminal domain to sequester AR in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells, thereby reducing AR transcriptional activity and inhibiting cell growth. However, constitutive repression of CCN3 by the Polycomb group protein EZH2 disrupted this negative feedback loop in both CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Notably, restoring CCN3 was sufficient to effectively reduce CPRC cell proliferation in vitro and to abolish xenograft tumor growth in vivo Taken together, our findings establish CCN3 as a pivotal regulator of AR signaling and prostate cancer progression and suggest a functional intersection between Polycomb and AR signaling in CRPC.

However, it remains as one of the most widely employed anticancer agents in treating various solid tumors including prostate cancer. Since heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a cytoprotective enzyme with anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, we investigated the effects of up-regulation of HO-1 by hemin and its inhibition by zinc protoporphyrin-IX (ZnPP) on cisplatin-induced testicular toxicity in adult rats. Furthermore, the anticancer effect of hemin and ZnPP, with and without cisplatin, was evaluated on human prostate cancer cell line, PC3. Results of the animal study showed that hemin reversed cisplatin-induced perturbations in sperm characteristics, normalized serum testosterone level, and ameliorated cisplatin-induced alterations in testicular and epididymal weights, and restored normal testicular architecture. Moreover, hemin increased the expression and activity of HO-1 protein and prevented cisplatin-induced testicular toxicity by virtue of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This effect was evidenced by amelioration of testicular oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione contents, and catalase activity) and inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide synthase expressions). In contrast, administration of ZnPP (HO-1 inhibitor) did not show significant improvement against cisplatin-induced testicular toxicity. Finally, in vitro analyses showed that, hemin augmented the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin, while ZnPP inhibited its apoptotic effect in PC3 cells. In conclusion, the induction of HO-1 represents a potential therapeutic approach to protect the testicular tissue from the detrimental effects of cisplatin without repressing, but rather augmenting, its cytotoxic effects on PC3 cells.""","""['Gehan Hussein Heeba', 'Alaaeldin Ahmed Hamza', 'Soha Osama Hassanin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Toxicol Lett""","""['Tadalafil alleviates cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicity through the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis in male rats.', 'Roflumilast protects from cisplatin-induced testicular toxicity in male rats and enhances its cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cell line.

We previously developed a 100-locus DNA classifier capable of substratifying patients at risk of biochemical relapse within clinical risk groups.  Objective:   The 100-locus genomic classifier was refined to 31 functional loci and tested with standard clinical variables for the ability to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis.  Design, setting, and participants:   Four retrospective cohorts of radical prostatectomy specimens from patients with localized disease were pooled, and an additional 102-patient cohort used to measure the 31-locus genomic classifier with the NanoString platform.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The genomic classifier scores were tested for their ability to predict BCR (n=563) and metastasis (n=154), and compared with clinical risk stratification schemes.  Results and limitations:   The 31-locus genomic classifier performs similarly to the 100-locus classifier. It identifies patients with elevated BCR rates (hazard ratio=2.73, p<0.001) and patients that eventually develop metastasis (hazard ratio=7.79, p<0.001). Combining the genomic classifier with standard clinical variables outperforms clinical models. Finally, the 31-locus genomic classifier was implemented using a NanoString assay. The study is limited to retrospective cohorts.  Conclusions:   The 100-locus and 31-locus genomic classifiers reliably identify a cohort of men with localized disease who have an elevated risk of failure. The NanoString assay will be useful for selecting patients for treatment deescalation or escalation in prospective clinical trials based on clinico-genomic scores from pretreatment biopsies.

Small-molecule effectors of SERCA are urgently needed as therapeutics for Ca2+ dysregulation in human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and heart failure. Here we report the development of a method for efficiently reconstituting SERCA in GUV, and we describe a streamlined protocol based on optimized parameters (e.g., lipid components, SERCA preparation, and activity assay requirements). ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport by SERCA in single GUV was detected directly using confocal fluorescence microscopy with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-5F. The GUV reconstitution system was validated for functional screening of Ca2+ transport using thapsigargin (TG), a small-molecule inhibitor of SERCA currently in clinical trials as a prostate cancer prodrug. The GUV system overcomes the problem of inhibitory Ca2+ accumulation for SERCA in native and reconstituted small unilamellar vesicles (SUV).

Ectopic expression of netrin-1 is reportedly associated with the progression of several carcinomas. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of netrin-1 in hypoxic metastasis potential of prostate carcinoma. Here, hypoxia induced the up-regulation of netrin-1 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. Importantly, knockdown of netrin-1 dramatically suppressed cell invasion, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC3 and DU145 cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, hypoxia treatment increased the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by increasing YAP expression in the nucleus and inhibiting p-YAP levels. However, YAP activation was notably restrained following netrin-1 down-regulation. Interestingly, interrupting YAP expression attenuated hypoxia-triggered cell invasion, migration and EMT of DU145 cells. More importantly, restoring YAP expression strikingly antagonized the inhibitory effects of netrin-1 decrease on the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   A set of DVSE was recorded from V25 to V75 (increments of 5Gy) (both in % and in cc) for 180 men. The rAUC was calculated for doses ranging between 25Gy and 50Gy (rAUC25-50). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the relationship between DVSE or rAUC25-50 and the appearance of any acute GI toxicity.  Results:   The rates of acute grade 1 (G1), G2 and G3 GI toxicities were 53.3 %, 10.6 % and 1.1 %, respectively. No G4+ toxicity was observed.

The aim of this study was to consider the patient perspective as part of the overall treatment decision-making process for CRPC, given that an alignment between patient preference and prescribing has been shown to benefit patient outcomes. This study examines preferences of patients with CRPC in Japan for treatment features associated with treatments like RA-223, abiraterone, and docetaxel and to examine the extent to which treatment preferences may vary between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.  Methods:   A two-phase research approach was implemented. In Phase 1, N = 8 patients with CRPC were recruited from a single hospital to complete a qualitative interview to provide feedback on the draft survey. In Phase 2, N = 134 patients with CRPC were recruited from five hospitals to complete a paper survey. The survey included 6 treatment choice questions, each asking patients to choose between two hypothetical treatments for their CRPC. Each treatment alternative was defined by the following attributes: length of overall survival (OS), time to a symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), method of administration, reduction in the risk of bone pain, treatment-associated risk of fatigue and lost work days. A hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate relative preference weights for each attribute level and mean relative importance.  Results:   A total of N = 133 patients with CRPC completed the survey and were included in the final analysis. Patients had a mean age of 75.4 years (SD = 7.4) and had been diagnosed with PC a mean of 6.5 years prior (SD = 4.4). Over the attribute levels shown, fatigue (relative importance [RI] = 24.9 %, 95 % CI: 24.7 %, 25.1 %) was the most important attribute, followed by reduction in the risk of bone pain (RI = 23.2 %, 95 % CI: 23.0 %, 23.5 %), and OS (RI = 19.2 %, 95 % CI: 19.0 %, 19.4 %). Although symptomatic patients placed significantly more importance on delaying an SSE (p < .05), no other preference differences were observed.

However, PCa aggressiveness differs between subjects of African descent and those of European extraction. Thus, genetic ancestry analysis may be used to detect population stratification in case-control association studies. We genotyped 11 ancestry informative markers to estimate the contributions of African, European, and Amerindian ancestries in a case-control sample of 213 individuals from Bahia State, Northeast Brazil, including 104 PCa patients. We compared this data with self-reported ancestry and the stratification of cases by PCa aggressiveness according to Gleason score. A larger African genetic contribution (44%) was detected among cases, and a greater European contribution (61%) among controls. Self-declaration data revealed that 74% of PCa patients considered themselves non-white (black and brown), and 41.3% of controls viewed themselves as white. Our data showed a higher degree of European ancestry among fast-growing cancer cases than those of intermediate and slow development. This differs from many previous studies, in which the prevalence of African ancestry has been reported for all grades. Differences were observed between degrees of PCa aggressiveness in terms of genetic ancestry. In particular, the greater European contribution among patients with high-grade PCa indicates that a population's genetic structure can influence case-control studies. This investigation contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of tumor aggressiveness among groups of different genetic ancestries, especially admixed populations, and has significant implications for the assessment of inter-population heterogeneity in drug treatment effects.""","""['J S Oliveira', 'R S Ferreira', 'L M Santos', 'L J Marin', 'R X Corrêa', 'M R Luizon', 'A L Simões', 'S R Gadelha', 'S M B Sousa']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Genet Mol Res""","""['Assessment of the relationship between self-declared ethnicity, mitochondrial haplogroups and genomic ancestry in Brazilian individuals.', 'A rapid screening of ancestry for genetic association studies in an admixed population from Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Neither self-reported ethnicity nor declared family origin are reliable indicators of genomic ancestry.', 'Genetic admixture in Brazil.', 'Biological determinants of health disparities in prostate cancer.', 'A systematic literature review on the European, African and Amerindian genetic ancestry components on Brazilian health outcomes.']"""

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind prospective study on use of denosumab versus alendronate in the therapy of secondary osteoporosis related to ADT.  Methods:   A total of 234 patients with diagnosis of osteoporosis underwent ADT for prostate cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months or alendronate (70 mg/week) for 2 years. All patient received supplemental vitamin D (600 IU/day) and supplemental calcium to maintain a calcium intake of 1200 mg per day. Effectiveness of therapy in both groups (denosumab group and alendronate group) was assessed by changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs), bone mineral density, fracture incidence, Visual Analogue Scale score for back pain, and Short Form-8 health survey score for health-related quality of life.  Results:   In the denosumab study group, level of BTMs for bone formation were significantly increased from baseline at all time points during the study (P<0.001); in the alendronate study group level of BTMs for bone formation were increased too (P>0.05).

We investigated the correlation between serum androgen levels and Gleason scores at biopsy. We analyzed data of 157 men with a total prostate-specific antigen range of 3-10 ng/mL who underwent initial systematic prostate needle biopsy for suspected prostate cancer between April 2000 and July 2003. Peripheral blood testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS. Blood levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were compared with pathological findings by multivariate analyses. Median values of prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume measured by ultrasound were 5.7 ng/mL and 31.4 cm3 , respectively. Benign prostatic hyperplasia was diagnosed in 97 patients (61.8%), and prostate cancer was diagnosed in 60 (38.2%) patients, including 31 (19.7%) patients with a Gleason score of 6 and 29 (18.5%) patients with a Gleason score of 7-10. Median values of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in blood were 3798.7 and 371.7 pg/mL, respectively. There was a strong correlation between serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In multivariate analysis, age, prostate volume, and serum dihydrotestosterone were significant predictors of benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6.

Because mechanical forces physiologically regulate bone-remodeling activity in osteocytes, we hypothesized that mechanical action of fluid flow (MAFF) at the cancer microenvironment may similarly foster prostate cancer cell osteomimicry.  Results:   We showed that in vitro MAFF on androgen-dependent (LNCap) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer cells remarkably increased OPG, VEGF, RunX2, PTH1R, and PTHrP gene expression in both cell lines irrespective of their androgen dependency. MAFF also altered the cytokine secretion pattern of prostate cancer cells, including Ang2, SCF, and TNFα increase with TRAIL decrease in the supernatant of both cell lines; preferential increase of Leptin and PDGF-BB in LnCap and of VEGF, IL-8, and G-CSF in PC3; and exclusive increase of FGFβ, MIF, and PECAM-1 with HGF decrease in LnCap, and of TGBβ1, HGF, M-CSF, CXCL1, and CCL7 with NGF decrease in PC3. Murine MLO-Y4 osteocyte-conditioned medium (CM) abrogated M-CSF, G-CSG, IL-8, TNFα, and FGFβ secretion-stimulating activity of mechanical stimulation on PC3 cells, and did the opposite effect on LnCap cells. However, MAFF fostered osteomimetic gene expression response of PC3 cells, but not of LnCap cells, to mechanically stimulated osteocyte-CM. Moreover, it abrogated TNFα and IL-8 secretion inhibitory effect of osteocyte-CM on mechanically stimulated PC3 cells and G-CSF, TNFα, and FGFβ-stimulating effect on mechanically stimulated LnCap cells.  Conclusions:   MAFF activated osteoblast-like phenotype of prostate cancer cells and altered their responses to osteocyte soluble factors. It also induced osteocyte production of osteomimetic gene expression- and cytokine secretion-stimulating factors for prostate cancer cells, particularly, when they were mechanically stimulated. Importantly, MAFF induced a prometastatic response in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, suggesting the interest of mechanical stimulation-dependent transcription and secretion patterns as diagnostic biomarkers, and as therapeutic targets for the screening of bone-metastasizing phenotype inhibitors upregulated during prostate cancer cell response to MAFF at the cancer microenvironment.

Since gene repression in human cancers frequently results from epigenetic alterations by DNA methylation and histone modifications, we examined whether the KAI1 gene becomes silenced through these epigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer.  Methods:   KAI1 mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses, respectively. Methylation status of the KAI1 promoter DNA in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR analysis of bisulfite-modified genomic DNAs. Methylated CpG sites in the KAI1 promoter were identified by sequencing the PCR clones of the bisulfite-modified KAI1 promoter DNA. KAI1 protein levels in human prostate cancer tissue samples were examined by immunofluorescence staining of the tissues with an anti-KAI1 antibody.  Results:   Among the three human prostate cancer cell lines examined, PC3 and DU145 cells exhibited markedly decreased levels of KAI1 mRNA and protein as compared to LNCaP cells, even though the exogenous KAI1 promoter not being methylated was normally functional in all these cell lines. Treatment of the low KAI1-expressing cell lines with a demethylating agent, 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, significantly elevated KAI1 expression levels, implicating the involvement of DNA methylation in KAI1 downregulation. Methylation of CpG islands within the KAI1 promoter region was observed in the low KAI1-expressing cells, but not in the high KAI1-expressing cells. Also, methyl CpG-binding proteins such as MBD2 and MeCP2 were complexed to the KAI1 promoter in the low KAI1-expressing cells. Bisulfite sequencing analysis identified the intensively methylated CpG residues in the KAI1 promoter clones derived from prostate cancer cells and tissues with no or low KAI1 expression. As in prostate cancer cell lines, prostate cancer tissues from patients also displayed a negative association between KAI1 expression levels and methylation status of the KAI1 promoter.  Conclusions:   The present data suggest that the KAI1 gene might be repressed by epigenetic alterations through the promoter CpG-site methylation during prostate cancer progression. This epigenetic mechanism could provide a clue for understanding how the KAI1 gene was silenced in metastatic prostate cancers.

Patients with advanced prostate cancer are vulnerable to difficult treatment decisions because of the nature of their disease.  Objective:   The aims of this study were to describe and understand the lived experience of patients with advanced prostate cancer and their decision partners who utilized an interactive decision aid, DecisionKEYS, to make informed, shared treatment decisions.  Methods:   This qualitative study uses a phenomenological approach that included a sample of 35 pairs of patients and their decision partners (16 pairs reflected patients with <6 months since their diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; 19 pairs reflected patients with >6 months since their diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer). Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews was conducted describing the lived experience of patients with advanced prostate cancer and their decision partners using an interactive decision aid.  Results:   Three major themes emerged: (1) the decision aid facilitated understanding of treatment options; (2) quality of life was more important than quantity of life; and (3) contact with healthcare providers greatly influenced decisions.  Conclusions:   Participants believed the decision aid helped them become more aware of their personal values, assisted in their treatment decision making, and facilitated an interactive patient-healthcare provider relationship.  Implications for practice:   Decision aids assist patients, decision partners, and healthcare providers make satisfying treatment decisions that affect quality/quantity of life.

An abnormal Hh signaling pathway is linked to numerous human cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma (MB), lung cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer, and it is therefore a promising target in cancer therapy. Using a structure-hopping approach, we designed new Hh signaling pathway inhibitors with isoindolinone or quinazolinone moieties, which were synthesized and biologically evaluated using an 8xGli-luciferase (Gli-Luc) reporter assay in NIH3T3 cells. Compounds 9-11 and 14 with isoindolinone scaffolds demonstrated moderate Hh inhibitory activity; whereas quinazolinone derivatives 24, 29, 32, 34, and 35 exhibited good potency with submicromolar IC50 values and the analog 28 showed nanomolar IC50 value. Although sonidegib shows a decrease in inhibitory effect on vismodegib resistance-conferring Smo mutants, the structurally modified new compounds not only possess the pharmacophoric properties of Hh pathway inhibition but also preserve the suppressive potency in drug-resistant Smo mutants. Mechanistically, quinazolinone derivatives 28 and 34 suppress Hh signaling by blocking Smo and Gli translocation into the cilia, similar to vismodegib and sonidegib. Additionally, the human microsomal stability of the representative analogs 28 and 34 were determined to be comparable to that of the reference compound sonidegib. Thus, these new scaffolds can serve as a platform for the development of novel cancer therapeutics targeting the Hh pathway.""","""['Deepak Bhattarai', 'Joo Hyun Jung', 'Seunghyeon Han', 'Hankyu Lee', 'Soo Jin Oh', 'Hyuk Wan Ko', 'Kyeong Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Inhibition of Hedgehog Signaling in Fibroblasts, Pancreatic, and Lung Tumor Cells by Oxy186, an Oxysterol Analogue with Drug-Like Properties.', 'Novel-smoothened inhibitors for therapeutic targeting of naïve and drug-resistant hedgehog pathway-driven cancers.', 'Discovery of potent and novel smoothened antagonists via structure-based virtual screening and biological assays.', 'Strategies to target the Hedgehog signaling pathway for cancer therapy.', 'Genomic testing, tumor microenvironment and targeted therapy of Hedgehog-related human cancers.', 'Moringa oleifera Lam.

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of 100 men who underwent urinary diversion (urinary conduit or continent catheterizable pouch) due to urinary adverse events after prostate radiotherapy from 2007 to 2016 from 9 academic centers in the United States. Outcome measurements included predictors of short and long-term complications, and readmission after urinary diversion of patients who had prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. The data were summarized using descriptive statistics and univariate associations with complications were identified with logistic regression controlling for center.  Results:   Mean patient age was 71 years and median time from radiotherapy to urinary diversion was 8 years. Overall 81 (81%) patients had combined modality therapy (radical prostatectomy plus radiotherapy or various combinations of radiotherapy). Grade 3a or greater Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in 31 (35%) men, including 4 deaths (4.5%). Normal weight men had more short-term complications compared to overweight (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-23.1, p=0.02) and obese men (OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.6-31.1, p=0.009).

Materials and methods:   Levels of free, intact, total prostate specific antigen, human kallikrein-2 and microseminoprotein-β were measured while blinded to outcomes in cryopreserved serum from men in the intervention arm of PLCO. Marker levels of 946 men, of whom 100 were African American, were incorporated into a prespecified statistical model to predict high grade prostate cancer on biopsy.  Results:   The detection of high grade prostate cancer in 94 men (10%) was enhanced by the 4-kallikrein panel with an AUC of 0.79 compared to 0.73 for PCPTRC (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator), representing a 0.060 increase (95% CI 0.032-0.088, p <0.01).

We analyzed the Canary PASS (Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study) to determine biopsy timing influence on rates of prostate cancer adverse reclassification at the first active surveillance biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Of 1,085 participants in PASS, 421 had fewer than 34% of cores involved with cancer and Gleason sum 6 or less, and thereafter underwent on-study active surveillance biopsy. Reclassification was defined as an increase in Gleason sum and/or 34% or more of cores with prostate cancer. First active surveillance biopsy reclassification rates were categorized as less than 8, 8 to 13 and greater than 13 months after diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression determined association between reclassification and first biopsy timing.  Results:   Of 421 men, 89 (21.1%) experienced reclassification at the first active surveillance biopsy. Median time from prostate cancer diagnosis to first active surveillance biopsy was 11 months (IQR 7.8-13.8). Reclassification rates at less than 8, 8 to 13 and greater than 13 months were 24%, 19% and 22% (p = 0.65). On multivariable analysis, compared to men biopsied at less than 8 months the OR of reclassification at 8 to 13 and greater than 13 months were 0.88 (95% CI 0.5,1.6) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.5,1.9), respectively. Prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or greater (referent less than 0.15, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 4.1) and body mass index 35 kg/m2 or greater (referent less than 25 kg/m2, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1,5.7) were associated with increased odds of reclassification.  Conclusions:   Timing of the first active surveillance biopsy was not associated with increased adverse reclassification but prostate specific antigen density and body mass index were.

We compared prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, pathologic stage, and surgical margin status between the groups. The impact of TP5 on biochemical recurrence was also assessed.  Results:   The median age was 68 years old with a median prostate-specific antigen level of 9.3 ng/mL. TP5 was present in 259 patients (6.4%) with a Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 and in 361 patients (8.9%) with a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7. The mean follow-up without progression was 3 years. The presence of a tertiary pattern correlated with pathologic stage; the only exception was that there was no statistically significant difference between Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 with TP5 and 4 + 3 = 7.

The online survey comprised 127 questions covering sociodemographic and disease-related information, decision-making habits, health-related quality of life, distress, depression, and anxiety. The primary outcome was to measure the effect of an OSG on the final treatment decision.  Results:   We analyzed the completed questionnaires from 686 patients with prostate cancer, 200 (29.2%) of whom revised their initial treatment decision. After revising their decisions, these patients more frequently underwent external beam radiation therapy (44.5% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.048) and active surveillance (10.5% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001) and less frequently underwent radical prostatectomy (52.5% vs. 74.9%, P<0.001). Engaging longer in the OSG, demanding a more active role in the decision-making process, and participating in a conventional support group were independently associated with revision of the initial treatment decision.  Conclusions:   Of all patients participating in the OSG, 29.2% revised their initial treatment decision. We estimate that this phenomenon may affect 17,000 patients with prostate cancer in the United States of America every year. This finding highlights the importance of OSGs for the health care system. The patient׳s desired degree of involvement in decision-making should be routinely clarified to adjust counseling accordingly.

Study design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Methods:   Our study population comprised 10,285 patients with a record of first ever prostate biopsy between 2009 and 2013 on computerized acute hospital discharge or outpatient records covering Scotland. Using the general population as a comparison group, expected numbers of admissions/deaths were derived by applying age-, sex-, deprivation category-, and calendar year-specific rates of hospital admissions/deaths to the study population. Indirectly standardized hospital admission ratios (SHRs) and mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by dividing the observed numbers of admissions/deaths by expected numbers.  Results:   Compared with background rates, patients were more likely to be admitted to hospital within 30 days (SHR 2.7; 95% confidence interval 2.4, 2.9) and 120 days (SHR 4.0; 3.8, 4.1) of biopsy.

The risk of death within 30 days of biopsy was not increased significantly (SMR 1.6; 0.9, 2.7), but within 120 days, the risk of death was significantly higher than expected (SMR 1.9; 1.5, 2.4). The risk of death increased with age and tended to be higher among patients with prior co-morbidity. Overall risks of hospitalization and of death up to 120 days were increased both in men diagnosed and those not diagnosed with prostate cancer.

To further explore the transactivation of HER2 by CXCL12, we investigated the role of small GTP protein Gαi2 in Src and HER2 phosphorylation in lipid raft membrane microdomains and the significance of CXCR4 in prostate cancer bone tumor growth.  Methods:   We used a variety of methods such as lipid raft isolation, invasion assays, an in vivo model of intratibial tumor growth, bone histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry to determine the role of CXCR4 signaling in lipid raft membrane microdomains and effects of targeting of CXCR4 for bone tumor growth.  Results:   We determined that (a) CXCL12/CXCR4 transactivation of EGFR and HER2 is confined to lipid raft membrane microdomains, (b) CXCL12 activation of HER2 and Src is mediated by small GTP proteins in lipid rafts, (c) inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis through plerixafor abrogates the initial establishment of tumor growth without affecting the growth of established bone tumors, and (d) inhibition of EGFR signaling through gefitinib leads to inhibition of established bone tumor growth.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that lipid raft membrane microdomains are key sites for CXCL12/CXCR4 transactivation of HER2 via small GTP binding protein Gαi2 and Src kinase.

Methods:   All newly diagnosed PCa patients in the Helsinki University Hospital were asked to fill in 15D and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Clinical background information was collected retrospectively from patient charts. Patients were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups based on the disease stage: Local, Locally advanced and Metastatic groups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to explore which factors explained variance in 15D scores. A regression model was built to map the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 15D in a random sample of 50% of patients and the model was tested in the other half of the patients.  Results:   In total, 1050 men with a mean age of 67 years responded to the questionnaires.

Herein, we use AuNCs for selective targeting of prostate cancer cells (PC3) via specific interaction between neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor and three different NPY analogs conjugated to AuNCs. Localized surface plasmon resonance band of the nanoconjugates was set around 800 nm, which is appropriate for in vivo applications. Long-term stability of nanoconjugates in different media was confirmed by UV-vis and DLS studies. Active NPY receptor targeting was observed by confocal microscopy showing time-dependent AuNCs cellular uptake. Activation of ERK1/2 pathway was evaluated by Western blot to confirm the receptor-mediated specific interaction with PC3. Cellular uptake kinetics were compared as a function of peptide structure. Cytotoxicity of nanoconjugates was evaluated by MTS and Annexin V assays, confirming their safety within the concentration range explored. Hyperthermia studies were carried out irradiating the cells, previously incubated with AuNCs, with a pulsed laser at 800 nm wavelength, showing a heating enhancement ranging from 6 to 35 °C above the culture temperature dependent on the irradiation power (between 1.6 and 12.7 W/cm2). Only cells treated with AuNCs underwent morphological alterations in the cytoskeleton structure upon laser irradiation, leading to membrane blebbing and loss of microvilli associated with cell migration.

However, the physiological role of SPOP in regulating prostate tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we identified the Cdc20 oncoprotein as a novel ubiquitin substrate of SPOP. As such, pharmacological inhibition of Cullin-based E3 ligases by MLN4924 could stabilize endogenous Cdc20 in cells. Furthermore, we found that Cullin 3, and, to a less extent, Cullin 1, specifically interacted with Cdc20. Depletion of Cullin 3, but not Cullin 1, could upregulate the abudance of Cdc20 largely via prolonging Cdc20 half-life. Moreover, SPOP, the adaptor protein of Cullin 3 family E3 ligase, specifically interacted with Cdc20, and promoted the poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Cdc20 in a degron-dependent manner. Importantly, prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutants failed to interact with Cdc20 to promote its degradation. As a result, SPOP-deficient prostate cancer cells with elevated Cdc20 expression became resistant to a pharmacological Cdc20 inhibitor.

However, animal models are resource intensive; moreover, they face ethical and scientific challenges because the outcomes obtained by animal testing may not correlate with human responses. To develop an alternative method for assessing chemical toxicity, we investigated the feasibility of using chemical-induced genome-wide expression changes in cultured human cells to predict the potential of a chemical to cause specific organ injuries in humans. We first created signatures of chemical-induced gene expression in a vertebral-cancer of the prostate cell line for ∼15,000 chemicals tested in the US National Institutes of Health Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures program. We then used the signatures to create naı̈ve Bayesian prediction models for chemical-induced human liver cholestasis, interstitial nephritis, and long QT syndrome. Detailed cross-validation analyses indicated that the models were robust with respect to false positives and false negatives in the samples we used to train the models and could predict the likelihood that chemicals would cause specific organ injuries. In addition, we performed a literature search for drugs and dietary supplements, not formally categorized as causing organ injuries in humans but predicted by our models to be most likely to do so. We found a high percentage of these compounds associated with case reports of relevant organ injuries, lending support to the idea that in vitro cell-based experiments can be used to predict the toxic potential of chemicals.

Our previous work demonstrated that the ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenger, MnTE-2-PyP, inhibited human prostate cancer growth and also inhibited prostate cancer migration and invasion. We showed that MnTE-2-PyP treatment altered the affinity of the histone acetyltransferase enzyme, p300, to bind to DNA. We speculate that this may be one mechanism by which MnTE-2-PyP inhibits prostate cancer progression. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP decreased p300/HIF-1/CREB complex (p300/hypoxia-inducible factor-1/cAMP response element-binding protein) binding to a specific hypoxia-response element (HRE) motif within the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene promoter region, and consequently, repressed PAI-1 expression. However, it remains unclear how MnTE-2-PyP reduces p300 complex binding affinity to the promoter region of specific genes. In this study, we found that overexpression of Cu/ZnSOD (superoxide dismutase 1, SOD1) significantly suppressed PAI-1 gene expression and p300 complex binding to the promoter region of PAI-1 gene, just as was observed in cells treated with MnTE-2-PyP. Furthermore, catalase (CAT) overexpression rescued the inhibition of PAI-1 expression and p300 binding by MnTE-2-PyP. Taken together, the above findings suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is likely the mediator through which MnTE-2-PyP inhibits the PAI-1 expression and p300 complex binding in PC3 cells. To confirm this, we measured the production of H2O2 following overexpression of SOD1 or catalase with MnTE-2-PyP treatment in the presence or absence of radiation. We found that MnTE-2-PyP increased the intracellular steady-state levels of H2O2 and increased nuclear H2O2 levels. As expected, catalase overexpression significantly decreased the levels of intracellular H2O2 induced by MnTE-2-PyP. We then determined if this increased H2O2 production could result in oxidized protein thiol groups.

CWF-145 inhibited prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145 and LNCap. It had a very low IC50 about 200 nM against castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) PC-3. We found that CWF-145 had a similar effect to clinical trial antimitotic agents in cancer cells and normal cells. CWF-145 arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase by binding to the β-tubulin at the colchicine-binding site then disrupted microtubule polymerization. Furthermore, the damaged microtubule affected the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our data showed that CWF-145 activated Akt and mTOR expression to increase emi1 accumulation and inhibit APC. The increased cyclin B1 and securin arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase. Moreover, we showed that Akt activation markedly increased resistance to microtubule-directed agents, including CWF-145, colchicine, and paclitaxel. Interestingly, rapamycin inhibited Akt-mediated therapeutic resistance, indicating that these effects were dependent on mTOR. Taken together, these observations suggest that activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway can promote resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that do not directly target metabolic regulation.

It is therefore important to identify the decision threshold with the least number of misclassifications. The proposed method uses trichotomization: it defines an Uncertain Interval around the point of intersection between the two distributions of individuals with and without the targeted disease. In this Uncertain Interval the diagnoses are intermixed and the numbers of correct and incorrect diagnoses are (almost) equal. This Uncertain Interval is considered to be a range of test scores that is inconclusive and does not warrant a decision. It is expected that defining such an interval with some precision, prevents a relatively large number of false decisions, and therefore results in an increased accuracy or correct classifications rate (CCR) for the test scores outside this Uncertain Interval. Clinical data and simulation results confirm this. The results show that the CCR is systematically higher outside the Uncertain Interval when compared to the CCR of the decision threshold based on the maximized Youden index. For strong tests with a very small overlap between the two distributions, it can be difficult to determine an Uncertain Interval. In simulations, the comparison with an existing method for test-score trichotomization, the Two-graph Receiver Operating Characteristic (TG-ROC), showed smaller differences between the two distributions for the Uncertain Interval than for TG-ROC's Intermediate Range and consequently a more improved CCR outside the Uncertain Interval. The main conclusion is that the Uncertain Interval method offers two advantages: 1. Identification of patients for whom the test results are inconclusive; 2.

We hypothesized that antagonism of the Hh pathway with vismodegib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) would result in pathway engagement, inhibition and perhaps induce measurable clinical responses in patients.  Methods:   This is a single-arm study of oral daily vismodegib in men with mCRPC. All patients were required to have biopsies of the tumor and skin (a surrogate tissue) at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy. Ten patients were planned for enrollment. The primary outcome was the pharmacodynamic assessment of Gli1 mRNA suppression with vismodegib in tumor tissue. Secondary outcomes included PSA response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.  Results:   Nine patients were enrolled. Gli1 mRNA was significantly suppressed by vismodegib in both tumor tissue (4/7 evaluable biopsies, 57%) and benign skin biopsies (6/8 evaluable biopsies, 75%). The median number of treatment cycles completed was three, with a median PFS of 1.9 months (95% CI 1.3, NA), and a median OS of 7.04 months (95% CI 3.4, NA). No patient achieved a PSA reduction or a measurable tumor response. Safety data were consistent with the known toxicities of vismodegib.  Conclusions:   Hh signaling, as measured by Gli1 mRNA expression in mCRPC tissues, was suppressed with vismodegib in the majority of patients.

Realtime polymerase chain reaction was used for the assessment of Pim-3 expression at the RNA level and Western blot was used to quantify the Pim-3 protein synthesis in 3 different cell lines. RESULTS We found that Pim-3 mRNA expression in prostate cancer tissue was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (p<0.05). Accordingly, the protein level expression of Pim-3 in prostate cancer cell lines was also significantly higher than that in control cells. In addition, the expression status of Pim-3 mRNA was significantly associated with pathological parameters such as pre-surgery prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, pathological stage, and lymphoid metastasis.

The purity was further verified using MALDI-TOF MS analysis, where two peaks at m/z 25509 and 27715 were obtained. The lower molecular weight peak corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of CRISP-3 (∼26kDa); whereas the higher molecular weight peak was confirmed to be the glycosylated form (∼28kDa) from the deglycosylation experiment. Binding of PSP94 in increasing concentrations to purified CRISP-3 immobilized chip was further validated using surface plasmon resonance.

In total, 150 ultrasound and CBCT scans were acquired in rapid succession and analyzed for setup errors. The deviation between setup errors of the two modalities was evaluated separately for each dimension.  Results:   A moderate correlation in lateral, vertical and longitudinal direction was observed comparing the setup errors. Mean differences between TPUS and CBCT were (-2.7 ± 2.3) mm, (3.0 ± 2.4) mm and (3.2 ± 2.7) mm in lateral, vertical and longitudinal direction, respectively. The mean Euclidean difference between TPUS and CBCT was (6.0 ± 3.1) mm. Differences up to 19.2 mm were observed between the two imaging modalities. Discrepancies between TPUS and CBCT of at least 5 mm occurred in 58 % of monitored treatment sessions.  Conclusion:   Setup differences between TPUS and CBCT are 6 mm on average.

TTP functions as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma, and in some human malignancies low TTP expression correlates with reduced survival. Here we report important prognostic and functional roles for TTP in human prostate cancer. First, gene expression analysis of prostate tumors revealed low TTP expression correlates with patients having high-risk Gleason scores and increased biochemical recurrence. Second, in prostate cancer cells with low levels of endogenous TTP, inducible TTP expression inhibits their growth and proliferation, as well as their clonogenic growth. Third, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, as forced TTP expression markedly impairs the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. Finally, pathway analysis of gene expression data suggested metabolism is altered by TTP expression in prostate tumor cells, and metabolic analyses revealed that such processes are impaired by TTP, including mitochondrial respiration. Collectively, these findings suggest that TTP is an important prognostic indicator for prostate cancer, and augmenting TTP function would effectively disable the metabolism and proliferation of aggressive prostate tumors.""","""['Anders E Berglund', 'Kristen E N Scott', 'Weimin Li', 'Chunying Yang', 'Mario R Fernandez', 'Franz X Schaub', 'John L Cleveland', 'Robert J Rounbehler']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Tumor suppressing effects of tristetraprolin and its small double-stranded RNAs in bladder cancer.', 'CREB targets define the gene expression signature of malignancies having reduced levels of the tumor suppressor tristetraprolin.', 'Mammary differentiation induces expression of Tristetraprolin, a tumor suppressor AU-rich mRNA-binding protein.', 'The role of RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin in cancer and immunity.', 'Roles of Tristetraprolin in Tumorigenesis.', 'The Tristetraprolin Family of RNA-Binding Proteins in Cancer: Progress and Future Prospects.', 'Posttranscriptional control of the replication stress response via TTP-mediated Claspin mRNA stabilization.', 'Low Tristetraprolin Expression Is Associated with Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Tristetraprolin Is a Prognostic Biomarker for Poor Outcomes among Patients with Low-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'The ARE-binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a novel target and mediator of calcineurin tumor suppressing function in the skin.']"""

MUC1 expression was specifically increased in DU145 cell-derived PC stem-like cells (PCSLCs) in comparison to their non-PCSLCs counterparts. While immunohistochemistry staining of 34 primary PCs revealed variability in MUC1 expression, Nanostring technology demonstrated elevated MUC1 mRNA levels in 4 of 7 PCs compared to their normal matched tissues. By analyzing MUC1 mRNA levels and gene copy number (GCN) using the OncomineTM database, elevations in MUC1 mRNA in 82 metastases versus 280 primary PCs and in MUC1 GCN in 37 metastases over 181 primary tumors were demonstrated. Analysis of genomic datasets within cBioPortal revealed increases in MUC1 GCN in 2% (6/333) of primary PCs, 6% (9/150) of metastatic PCs, and 33% (27/82) of CRPCs; in comparison, the respective increase in androgen receptor (AR) GCN was 1%, 63%, and 56%, revealing a specific increase in MUC1 GCN for CRPC. Furthermore, a 25-gene MUC1 network was amplified in 52% of CRPCs compared to 69% of CRPCs displaying increases in an AR co-regulator group. While genomic alterations in the MUC1 network largely overlap with those in the AR group, 18 CRPCs (66.7% being neuroendocrine PC) showed genomic alterations only in the MUC1 network. Moreover, genomic alterations in the MUC1 network correlated with PC relapse.

Studies assessing the association of zinc intake and prostate cancer have yielded inconsistent results. Furthermore, very little is known about the relationship between zinc intake and prostate cancer among African Americans. We examined the association between self-reported zinc intake and prostate cancer in a hospital-based case-control study of African Americans. We then compared our results with previous studies by performing a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence regarding the association between zinc and prostate cancer. Newly diagnosed African American men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (n = 127) and controls (n = 81) were recruited from an urban academic urology clinic in Washington, DC. Controls had higher zinc intake, with a mean of 14 mg/day versus 11 mg/day for cases. We observed a non-significant, non-linear increase in prostate cancer when comparing tertiles of zinc intake (OR <6.5 vs 6.5-12.5mg/day 1.8, 95% CI: 0.6,5.6; OR <6.5 vs >12.5mg/day 1.3, 95% CI: 0.2,6.5). The pooled estimate from 17 studies (including 3 cohorts, 2 nested case-control, 11 case-control studies, and 1 randomized clinical trial, with a total of 111,199 participants and 11,689 cases of prostate cancer) was 1.07hi vs lo 95% CI: 0.98-1.16. Using a dose-response meta-analysis, we observed a non-linear trend in the relationship between zinc intake and prostate cancer (p for nonlinearity = 0.0022). This is the first study to examine the relationship between zinc intake in black men and risk of prostate cancer and systematically evaluate available epidemiologic evidence about the magnitude of the relationship between zinc intake and prostate cancer.

Herein, we show that a supplementation of metastatic PCa cells (androgen independent PC-3 and androgen dependent LNCaP) with sarcosine stimulates cells proliferation in vitro. Similar stimulatory effects were observed also in PCa murine xenografts, in which sarcosine treatment induced a tumor growth and significantly reduced weight of treated mice (p < 0.05). Determination of sarcosine metabolism-related amino acids and enzymes within tumor mass revealed significantly increased glycine, serine and sarcosine concentrations after treatment accompanied with the increased amount of sarcosine dehydrogenase. In both tumor types, dimethylglycine and glycine-N-methyltransferase were affected slightly, only. To identify the effects of sarcosine treatment on the expression of genes involved in any aspect of cancer development, we further investigated expression profiles of excised tumors using cDNA electrochemical microarray followed by validation using the semi-quantitative PCR. We found 25 differentially expressed genes in PC-3, 32 in LNCaP tumors and 18 overlapping genes. Bioinformatical processing revealed strong sarcosine-related induction of genes involved particularly in a cell cycle progression. Our exploratory study demonstrates that sarcosine stimulates PCa metastatic cells irrespectively of androgen dependence.

Secondary aim was to evaluate oncologic and functional results. The main intent of PERUSIA is to reduce injury of the Neuro-Vascular Bundles (NVB) and to preserve periurethral anterior structures. This is the first reported prospective cohort study about our technique.  Materials and methods:   We collected prospective data of a cohort of 210 patients who had undergone PERUSIA RP between January 2013 and May 2015. Key points of this technique included the following: posterior approach to intrafascial plane, which was developed from the median to lateral side, anterograde preservation of the Veil of Aphrodite, and development of an anterior avascular plane to preserve the santorini plexus. We included only sexually potent patients with low-risk disease. Perioperative, oncologic, and functional outcomes were collected. Postoperative full continence was defined as no pad use. Patients were defined potent when International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score was >17. Median follow-up was 22 months.  Results:   Median operative time and median estimated blood loss were 120 minutes and 150 mL, respectively. 25 patients (11.9%) experienced a total of 36 complications overall with an overall complication rate of 17.1%. We reported 3 (8.3%) grade IIIb complications and no major ones. Overall positive surgical margin rate was 20% with biochemical recurrence occurring in 3.8% of patients at a median follow-up of 22 months. Immediate urinary continence rate (1 day after catheter removal) was 66.6%. At 3 and 12 months, the continence rate was 90.4% and 96.1%, respectively, while sexual potency rate was 70.4% and 80.9%.

We analyzed the impact of salvage extended lymph node dissection (sLND) on cancer control in patients with rising PSA and lymph node (LN) metastases.  Methods:   Between 2009 and 2016 we performed sLND in 87 patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and positive LNs on 18FEC and 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/X-ray computer tomography (PET/CT) after primary treatment (PT) of PCa. Intra- and postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo were assessed and the rates of biochemical response (BR), BCR-free and clinical recurrence (CR)-free survival, as well as time to initiation of systemic treatment were evaluated.  Results:   Mean age of patients and mean PSA at sLND was 66.7 years (46-80 years) and 2.63 ng ml-1 (1.27-3.75 ng ml-1), respectively. With 87.4% radical prostatectomy (RP) was the most common PT. In all, 57.9% of patients additionally underwent adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy (RT) and 18.4% received ADT before sLND. Complete BR (cBR) was diagnosed in 27.5% of patients and incomplete BR in 40.6%. In total, 62.2% of patients remained without ADT at follow-up. With a median follow-up of 21 months (1-75 months), the cancer-specific mortality rate was 3.7%. The 3-year BCR-free, systemic therapy-free and CR-free survival rates for patients with cBR were 69.3%, 77.0% and 75%, respectively.  Conclusions:   sLND can be performed without significant complications and achieves an immediate BR, thus allowing a significant postponement of systemic therapy in selected patients with BCR and nodal recurrence of PCa. Therefore, sLND following 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT should be considered as part of a multimodal diagnostic and treatment concept for selective patients.""","""['D Porres', 'D Pfister', 'A Thissen', 'T H Kuru', 'V Zugor', 'R Buettner', 'R Knuechel', 'F A Verburg', 'A Heidenreich']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Long-term Outcomes of Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Not as Good as Previously Thought.', 'Salvage lymph node dissection after 68Ga-PSMA or 18F-FEC PET/CT for nodal recurrence in prostate cancer patients.', 'Robotic salvage lymph node dissection for nodal-only recurrences after radical prostatectomy: Perioperative and early oncological outcomes.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Necessity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in the PSMA PET/CT Era: A Narrative Review.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Treated with Metastasis-Directed Therapy Guided by Positron Emission Tomography: Does the Tracer Matter?', 'Combining PSA and PET features to select candidates for salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer.', 'The impact of PSMA PET on the treatment and outcomes of men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Oligometastatic prostate cancer: definition and the role of local and systemic therapy: a narrative review.']"""

We assessed whether living in the proximity of greener areas was related to prostate cancer incidence in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada.  Materials and methods:   Interviews eliciting lifetime addresses were conducted with 1933 prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2005-2009 and 1994 population controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated the association between residential greenness, both at recruitment (2005-2009) and about ten years prior (1996), defined by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the home, and prostate cancer risk. Three models were developed adjusting for age, individual characteristics, and individual and ecological characteristics, estimating relative risk in relation to an interquartile range (IQR) increase of the NDVI.  Results:   We observed inverse associations between greenness measured within home buffers of 150m, 300m, 500m and 1000m, at both time points, and risk of prostate cancer, independently of individual and ecological characteristics. For instance, using a buffer of 300m, the OR for an IQR increase of 0.11 in NDVI at the time of recruitment was 0.82 (95%CI 0.74-0.92). The corresponding OR for an IQR increase of 0.15 in NDVI in 1996 was 0.86 (95%CI 0.74-1.00). There were little differences in risks according to buffer size, the time point of exposure, when considering prostate cancer aggressiveness, or when restricting controls to men recently screened for prostate cancer to reduce the likelihood of undiagnosed cancer among them.  Conclusion:   Men living in greener areas, either recently or about a decade earlier, had lower risks of prostate cancer, independently of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors.

For medical treatment of PCa, a number of therapies are available. The economic consequences associated with these individual treatment options in routine care in Germany are unclear so far.  Methods:   The present analysis was based on the Germany-wide HAROW observational study, which was conducted from 2008-2013. During this study, all participating physicians and involved patients reported and documented individual health care resource consumption. These data were evaluated in monetary terms stratified by treatment regime (hormone therapy, HT; active surveillance, AS; radiotherapy, RT; radical prostatectomy, RP; watchful waiting, WW).  Results:   Overall, the data of 2672 patients were available for analysis. Based on the observational study design, the included patient groups were heterogeneous in their baseline characteristics. The annual total costs from the societal perspective were the largest for patient undergoing RP (9254 €; 95 % CI 8353-10,154), mainly driven by the costs for the initial hospital stay for surgery. HT, AS, RT, and WW seem to be comparable in terms of direct costs, ranging from 805 € (95 % CI 154-1455) for WW up to 1115 € (95 % CI 826-1405) for RT. The highest indirect costs were observed for patients receiving RT (3928 €; 95 % CI 0-10,675), which can be justified by the frequent incapacity to work in this patient group.  Conclusion:   The treatment of prostate cancer can lead to significant economic follow-up costs which vary greatly depending on the type of treatment. The analysis indicates a need for the implementation of a long-term health economic study in the future, which will be more suitable to show treatment-specific differences in the temporal occurrence of costs.""","""['T Reinhold', 'C Dornquast', 'C Börgermann', 'L Weißbach']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Managing localized prostate cancer by radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting: Cost analysis of a randomized trial (SPCG-4).', 'Healthcare costs among men with favorable risk prostate cancer managed with observation strategies versus immediate treatment in an integrated healthcare system.', 'Utilizing time-driven activity-based costing to understand the short- and long-term costs of treating localized, low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Economic analysis of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.', 'Maximizing resources in the local treatment of prostate cancer: A summary of cost-effectiveness studies.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Noninvasive treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer in elderly patients-results of the HAROW study.', 'A comprehensive analysis of cost of an active surveillance cohort compared to radical prostatectomy as primary treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Health services research in German radiation oncology: new opportunities to advance cancer care.']"""

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways have been implicated in prostate cancer chemoresistance. Here we investigated whether their combined targeting may re-sensitize prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.In hormone-insensitive PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) alone did not lead to significant cell death, however, it strongly sensitized cells to low levels (5 nM) of docetaxel. We show that mTOR inhibition has led to a decrease in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein levels and SK1 mRNA. HIF-1α accumulation induced by CoCl2 has led to a partial chemoresistance to RAD001/docetaxel combination. SK1 overexpression has completely protected prostate cancer cells from RAD001/docetaxel effects. Using gene knockdown and CoCl2 treatment we showed that SK1 mRNA expression is downstream of HIF-1α. In a human xenograft model in nude mice single RAD001 and docetaxel therapies induced 23% and 15% reduction in prostate tumor volume, respectively, while their combination led to a 58% reduction. RAD001 alone or in combination with docetaxel has suppressed intratumoral mTOR and SK1 signaling, however as evidenced by tumor size, it required docetaxel for clinical efficacy. Combination therapy was well tolerated and had similar levels of toxicity to docetaxel alone.Overall, our data demonstrate a new mechanism of docetaxel sensitization in prostate cancer.

In this study, we engineered murine B16 melanoma cells to secrete high levels of soluble TWEAK and examined their properties. TWEAK production by B16 cells preferentially activated the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and increased the expression of several previously described TWEAK-inducible genes, including Fn14. TWEAK overexpression in B16 cells inhibited both cell growth and invasion in vitro. The TWEAK-mediated reduction in B16 cell invasive capacity was dependent on activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, we found that this same signaling pathway was also important for TWEAK-stimulated human DU145 prostate cancer cell invasion.

Here, we show how the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) negatively controls mitochondrial respiration in prostate cancer cells. Sustained treatment of prostate cancer cells with androgens increased the activity of several metabolic pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and lipid synthesis. An analysis of the intersection of gene expression, binding events, and motif analyses after androgen exposure identified a metabolic gene expression signature associated with the action of ERRγ. This metabolic state paralleled the loss of ERRγ expression. It occurred in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer and was associated with cell proliferation. Clinically, we observed an inverse relationship between ERRγ expression and disease severity. These results illuminate a mechanism in which androgen-dependent repression of ERRγ reprograms prostate cancer cell metabolism to favor mitochondrial activity and cell proliferation.

Here we describe an alternative mechanism involving upregulation of the microRNA miR-424 that leads to impaired ubiquitination and degradation of oncogenic transcription factors in prostate cancers. We found that miR-424 targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 and identified STAT3 as a key substrate of COP1 in promoting tumorigenic and cancer stem-like properties in prostate epithelial cells. Altered protein turnover due to impaired COP1 function led to accumulation and enhanced basal and cytokine-induced activity of STAT3. We further determined that loss of the ETS factor ESE3/EHF is the initial event that triggers the deregulation of the miR-424/COP1/STAT3 axis. COP1 silencing and STAT3 activation were effectively reverted by blocking of miR-424, suggesting a possible strategy to attack this key node of tumorigenesis in ESE3/EHF-deficient tumors.

Materials and methods:   A single-center prospective randomized study of 212 patients referred for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSBx) was performed. All patients were divided into two groups: Group A (GA), 106 patients with moderate/marked presence of prostatic calculi visualized by TRUS; Group B (GB), 106 patients with absence/scarce of prostatic calcifications. Patients were handed questionnaires to obtain a validated data on the duration and impact of hematospermia on sexual activity. The anxiety scores were recorded using a visual analogue scale.  Results:   No significant difference was noted between the two groups when comparing age, preoperative PSA level, prostate volume, and biopsy number, except for digital rectal examination (DRE) findings. Post-biopsy results of patients included in GA revealed that the complication of hematospermia was present in 65.1%, while in GB was present in 39.7% (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis for identifying significant preoperative predictors of hematospermia, which included variables of age, PSA, prostate volume, and prostate cancer were not shown to be significant predictors of hematospermia, except DRE and prostate calculi (p<0.001). The mean anxiety score was 3.7±2.8 in GA and 2.3±1.9 in GB, respectively (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Prostatic calculi are an independent predictive factor of severe hematospermia after TRUSBx on the basis of multivariate analysis, but don't affect the positive rate of prostate cancer.

Previously, we characterized somatic alterations in metastatic tumours in the methylcytosine dioxygenase ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2), which is altered in 5-15% of myeloid, kidney, colon and PCas. Genome-wide association studies previously identified non-coding risk variants associated with PCa and melanoma. We perform fine-mapping of PCa risk across TET2 using genotypes from the PEGASUS case-control cohort and identify six new risk variants in introns 1 and 2. Oligonucleotides containing two risk variants are bound by the transcription factor octamer-binding protein 1 (Oct1/POU2F1) and TET2 and Oct1 expression are positively correlated in prostate tumours. TET2 is expressed in normal prostate tissue and reduced in a subset of tumours from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Small interfering RNA-mediated TET2 knockdown (KD) increases LNCaP cell proliferation, migration and wound healing, verifying loss drives a cancer phenotype. Endogenous TET2 bound the androgen receptor (AR) and AR-coactivator proteins in LNCaP cell extracts, and TET2 KD increases prostate-specific antigen (KLK3/PSA) expression. Published data reveal TET2 binding sites and hydroxymethylcytosine proximal to KLK3. A gene co-expression network identified using TCGA prostate tumour RNA-sequencing identifies co-regulated cancer genes associated with 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and succinate metabolism, including TET2, lysine demethylase (KDM) KDM6A, BRCA1-associated BAP1, and citric acid cycle enzymes IDH1/2, SDHA/B, and FH. The co-expression signature is conserved across 31 TCGA cancers suggesting a putative role for TET2 as an energy sensor (of 2-OG) that modifies aspects of androgen-AR signalling. Decreased TET2 mRNA expression in TCGA PCa tumours is strongly associated with reduced patient survival, indicating reduced expression in tumours may be an informative biomarker of disease progression and perhaps metastatic disease.""","""['M L Nickerson', 'S Das', 'K M Im', 'S Turan', 'S I Berndt', 'H Li', 'H Lou', 'S A Brodie', 'J N Billaud', 'T Zhang', 'A J Bouk', 'D Butcher', 'Z Wang', 'L Sun', 'K Misner', 'W Tan', 'A Esnakula', 'D Esposito', 'W Y Huang', 'R N Hoover', 'M A Tucker', 'J R Keller', 'J Boland', 'K Brown', 'S K Anderson', 'L E Moore', 'W B Isaacs', 'S J Chanock', 'M Yeager', 'M Dean', 'T Andresson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['TET2 repression by androgen hormone regulates global hydroxymethylation status and prostate cancer progression.', 'Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Pioneer factors in hormone-dependent cancers.', 'Unveiling the genomic landscape of possible metastatic malignant transformation of teratoma secondary to cisplatin-chemotherapy: a Tempus gene analysis-based case report literature review.', 'Tumor hypoxia: From basic knowledge to therapeutic implications.', 'Unravelling genetic variants of a swedish family with high risk of prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms that regulate the activities of TET proteins.', 'The role of epigenetic modifications in Colorectal Cancer Metastasis.']"""

A major hurdle is the availability of tools to easily assess its activity across many samples. Here, we introduce a transcriptional signature to specifically track CDK2 activity. It responds to genetic and chemical perturbations in the CDK-RB-E2F axis, correlates with mitotic rate in vitro and in vivo and reacts rapidly to changes in CDK2 activity during cell cycle progression. We find that CDK2 activity is specifically elevated in human testes, mirroring its critical function in mice, and report very distinct profiles across human cancers. Increased CDK2 activity decreases risk in colon cancer, but elevates poor outcome two- to fivefold in specific tumors, including low grade glioma, kidney, thyroid, adrenocortical and prostate cancer. These are typically 'CDK2-low' cancers, suggesting that above a certain threshold CDK2 promotes progression, but further increases do not influence outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed that the CDK2 signature is the most important predictive feature in these cancers versus dozens of other clinical parameters, such as tumor grade or mitotic index. Thus, transcriptome data provides a novel, straightforward method to monitor CDK2 activity, implicates key roles for the kinase in a subset of human tissues and tumors and enhances cancer risk prediction.

Here, we explored the impact of the loss of Axl in PCa cells (PC3 and DU145) on the induction of their dormancy when they are co-cultured with a pre-osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. MC3T3-E1 cells dramatically decrease the proliferation of PCa cells, however this suppressive effect of osteoblasts is significantly reduced by the reduction of Axl expression in PCa cells. Interestingly, expression of both TGF-β and its receptors were regulated by Axl expression in PCa cells, while specific blockade of TGF-β signaling limited the ability of the osteoblasts to induce dormancy of PCa cells. Finally, we found that both Gas6 and Axl are required for TGF-β2-mediated cell growth suppression.

The aim was to assess whether differences in fucosylation (Fucα1-6/3GlcNAc carbohydrates) of PSA either in urine, blood or tissue enable the discrimination of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and young males.  Design and methods:   Two novel lectin-immunoassays were developed for the analysis of fucosylation of PSA by measuring the time-resolved fluorescence of europium chelate.

Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that belongs to the Ras-association domain family. Several studies have demonstrated that hypermethylation of the RASSF1A promoter is frequently observed in lung, prostate, and breast cancers. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a phytochemical abundant in cruciferous vegetables, possesses chemopreventive activities; however, its potential involvement in epigenetic mechanisms remains elusive. The present study aimed to examine the role of PEITC in the epigenetic reactivation of RASSF1A and the induction of apoptosis in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were treated for 5days with 0.01% DMSO, 2.5 or 5μM PETIC or 2.5μM azadeoxycytidine (5-Aza) with 0.5μM trichostatin A (TSA). We evaluated the effects of these treatments on CpG demethylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS). CpG demethylation was significantly enhanced in cells treated with 5μM PEITC and 5-Aza+TSA; therefore, the latter treatment was used as a positive control in subsequent experiments. The decrease in RASSF1A promoter methylation correlated with an increase in expression of the RASSF1A gene in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm that promoter demethylation was mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), we analyzed the expression levels of DNMTs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) at the gene and protein levels. PEITC reduced DNMT1, 3A and 3B protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, and 5μM PEITC significantly reduced DNMT3A and 3B protein levels. HDAC1, 2, 4 and 6 protein expression was also inhibited by 5μM PEITC. The combination of 5-Aza and TSA, a DNMT inhibitor and a HDAC inhibitor, respectively, was used as a positive control as this treatment significantly inhibited both HDACs and DNMTs. The function of RASSF1A reactivation in promoting apoptosis and inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest was analyzed using flow-cytometry analysis with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Growth inhibition effect on LNCaP cells were investigated by colony formation assay. In addition, we analyzed p21, caspase-3 and 7, Bax, and Cyclin B1 protein levels. Flow-cytometry analysis of cells stained with PI alone demonstrated that 5μM PEITC promotes early apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with Annexin V and PI also demonstrated an increased proportion of cells in early apoptosis in cells treated with 5μM PEITC or 5-Aza with TSA. PEITC and efficiently inhibit colony numbers and total area. In addition, 5μM PEITC significantly enhanced p21, caspase-3, 7 and Bax levels and reduced Cyclin B1 expression compared with the control group.

In the recent years, with the development of new device technology, Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and complex treatment modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery and helical tomotherapy were started to be implemented. Thus, due to increased local control of tumor growth and reduction of dose received by surrounding critical organs, serious complications were avoided. In this new treatment modality, while calculating appropriate dose, all the parameters such as patient anatomy and characteristics of radiation should be taken into account. Besides, during conformal radiotherapy, if hip prosthesis is located around or in the clinical target volume (CTV), type, thickness and density of biomaterial should be considered to avoid dose differences.""","""['Yasemin Benderli Cihan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Conversion of the helical tomotherapy plans to the step-and-shoot IMRT plans for patients with hip prosthesis during radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Conversion of the helical tomotherapy plans to the step-and-shoot IMRT plans for patients with hip prosthesis during radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume histogram comparison between static 5-field IMRT with 18-MV X-rays and helical tomotherapy with 6-MV X-rays.', 'Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', '3D treatment planning on helical tomotherapy delivery system.']"""

It is based on the EGSnrc code system, enabling simulation of photons and electrons. Complex geometries are modelled using the EGSnrc C++ class library and egs_brachy includes a library of geometry models for many brachytherapy sources, in addition to eye plaques and applicators. Several simulation efficiency enhancing features are implemented in the code. egs_brachy is benchmarked by comparing TG-43 source parameters of three source models to previously published values. 3D dose distributions calculated with egs_brachy are also compared to ones obtained with the BrachyDose code. Well-defined simulations are used to characterize the effectiveness of many efficiency improving techniques, both as an indication of the usefulness of each technique and to find optimal strategies. Efficiencies and calculation times are characterized through single source simulations and simulations of idealized and typical treatments using various efficiency improving techniques. In general, egs_brachy shows agreement within uncertainties with previously published TG-43 source parameter values. 3D dose distributions from egs_brachy and BrachyDose agree at the sub-percent level. Efficiencies vary with radionuclide and source type, number of sources, phantom media, and voxel size. The combined effects of efficiency-improving techniques in egs_brachy lead to short calculation times: simulations approximating prostate and breast permanent implant (both with (2 mm)3 voxels) and eye plaque (with (1 mm)3 voxels) treatments take between 13 and 39 s, on a single 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 processor core, to achieve 2% average statistical uncertainty on doses within the PTV. egs_brachy will be released as free and open source software to the research community.""","""['Marc J P Chamberland', 'Randle E P Taylor', 'D W O Rogers', 'Rowan M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""[""Reply to Comment on 'egs_brachy: a versatile and fast Monte Carlo code for brachytherapy'."", ""Comment on 'egs_brachy: a versatile and fast Monte Carlo code for brachytherapy'."", 'Monte Carlo Study on Dose Distributions Around 192Ir, 169Yb, and 125I Brachytherapy Sources Using EGSnrc-based egs_brachy User-code.', 'Update of the CLRP TG-43 parameter database for low-energy brachytherapy sources.', 'Update of the CLRP Monte Carlo TG-43 parameter database for high-energy brachytherapy sources.', ""Comment on 'egs_brachy: a versatile and fast Monte Carlo code for brachytherapy'."", 'Update of the CLRP eye plaque brachytherapy database for photon-emitting sources.', 'Commissioning Validation of a Brachytherapy Treatment Planning System with EGSnrc Monte Carlo Code and EBT3 GAFChromic Film.', 'Monte Carlo Study on Dose Distributions Around 192Ir, 169Yb, and 125I Brachytherapy Sources Using EGSnrc-based egs_brachy User-code.', 'Monte Carlo study of TG-43 dosimetry parameters of GammaMed Plus high dose rate 192 Ir brachytherapy source using TOPAS.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of the effect of magnetic fields on brachytherapy dose distributions in lung tissue material.', 'Measurements and Monte Carlo calculation of radial dose and anisotropy functions of BEBIG 60Co high-dose-rate brachytherapy source in a bounded water phantom.']"""

Methods:   Ninety-four patients with localized PC treated with 3DCRT, with an estimated risk of lymph node involvement ?15%, according to the Roach formula, were evaluated in this study. All patients received a total dose of 72Gy in 36 fractions. Acute and late lower gastrointestinal tract (LGIT) toxicity were graded according to the EORTC radiation morbidity scoring scale. Characteristics such as alcohol intake, gastrointestinal (GI) co-morbidities, hemorrhoids, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery (PAPS), diabetes mellitus (DM), the use of antiaggregants, and dosimetric parameters, were analyzed as possible predictive factors of radiation (RT) toxicity.  Results:   Grade ?1 acute LGIT toxicity during 3DCRT developed in 41 of 94 patients (43.6%). At univariate logistic regression analysis (UVA) using the baseline model, alcohol consumption (p=0.068), hemorrhoids (p=0.004), GI co-morbidities (p=0.018), PAPS (p=0.033), V60 (p=0.070), V65 (p=0.046) and V70 (P=0.056) were significant predictive factors for any grade of acute LGIT toxicity.

Methods:   75 patients undergoing RP who had PNI on prostate needle biopsy were retrospectively reviewed. To evaluate the correlation between PNI and adverse pathological characteristics of PCa we examined these demographic and clinicopathologic variables: patients age, family history, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level at the time of diagnosis, biopsy Gleason score (GS), clinical stage, extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margins (PSM), biochemical recurrence (BR), positive lymph nodes (PLN) involvement and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI).

The aim of our study is to investigate potential differences in lifestyle factors among cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals in a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States.  Methods:   Using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial, 10,133 cancer survivors were identified and compared to 81,992 participants without cancer to evaluate differences in body mass index (BMI), smoking, NSAID use, and physical activity.  Results:   Cancer survivors, compared to the cancer-free, were significantly less likely to engage in physical activity (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.77-0.88). Compared to those who were obese at baseline, cancer survivors were more likely to be at normal BMI at follow-up compared to the cancer-free (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.42-2.54). Cancer survivors were less likely to report regular aspirin use as compared to the cancer-free population (OR = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.82-0.92). Of the current smokers, cancer survivors were more likely to be former smokers at follow-up compared to the cancer-free (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.30-1.74).  Conclusion:   Upon stratification by baseline health markers, cancer survivors practice healthier lifestyle habits such as smoking cessation and maintenance of a healthy weight.

LDAH is reported to hydrolyze cholesterol esters and to be important in macrophage cholesterol ester metabolism. Here, we confirm that LDAH is localized to LDs in several model systems. We generated a murine model in which Ldah is disrupted but found no evidence for a major function of LDAH in cholesterol ester or triacylglycerol metabolism in vivo, nor a role in energy or glucose metabolism.

Patients were randomized (34/arm) to sipuleucel-T followed by ADT (started 2 weeks after sipuleucel-T completion), or ADT followed by sipuleucel-T (started 12 weeks after ADT initiation); ADT continued for 12 months in both arms. The primary endpoint was PA2024-specific T-cell response [enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)] over time.Results: PA2024-specific ELISPOT responses over time were similar between groups, except at week 6, where responses were higher with sipuleucel-T→ADT versus ADT→sipuleucel-T (P = 0.013). PA2024-specific T-cell proliferation responses, averaged across time points, were approximately 2-fold higher with sipuleucel-T→ADT versus ADT→sipuleucel-T (P = 0.001). PA2024-specific cellular and humoral responses and prostatic acid phosphatase-specific humoral responses increased significantly versus baseline (P < 0.001) and were maintained for 24 months (both arms). Median time-to-PSA recurrence was similar between arms (21.8 vs. 22.6 months, P = 0.357). Development of a PA2024-specific humoral response correlated with prolonged time-to-PSA progression (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.67; P = 0.007). Sipuleucel-T with ADT was generally well tolerated.Conclusions: Sipuleucel-T→ADT appears to induce greater antitumor immune responses than the reverse sequence.

Consequently, resources are increasingly being directed toward risk stratification in this cohort. However, the risk of prostate cancer mortality in this group before the introduction of supplemental biomarkers and imaging techniques is unclear.  Materials and methods:   The PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer) Screening Trial provides survival data prior to the implementation of new diagnostic interventions. We divided men with an initial positive screen and a subsequent prostate biopsy into cohorts based on positive or negative results. Prostate cancer specific mortality was then compared to that in the trial control arm to estimate the prognostic significance of biopsy results relative to the general population.  Results:   A total of 36,525 and 36,560 patients comprised the screening and control arms, respectively. Of 4,064 subjects with a positive first screen 1,233 underwent a linked biopsy, of which 473 were positive and 760 were negative. At a median followup of 12.9 years, 1.1% of men in the negative biopsy cohort had died of prostate cancer. The difference in mortality rates between the negative biopsy and control arms was 0.734 deaths per 1,000 person-years. The proportional subhazard ratios of prostate cancer specific mortality for negative biopsy and positive biopsy relative to the control arm were 2.93 (95% CI 1.44-5.99) and 18.77 (95% CI 12.62-27.93), respectively.

In older men with multiple comorbidities, radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy is an attractive option. Common side effects of androgen deprivation therapy include hot flushes, tiredness, increased risk of fractures, increased risk of metabolic disorders, coronary heart disease, and psychological effects. This case highlights the potential side effect of lipodystrophy secondary to leuprolide acetate injections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an instance.  Case presentation:   In this case report, we describe a 70-year-old white man with prostate-specific antigen of 1.8 ng/mL, clinical stage T2bN0M0, Gleason 4+5=9 prostate cancer who developed an unusual side effect from leuprolide acetate as part of his androgen deprivation therapy. Approximately 2 months after the initial 3-monthly injection of leuprolide acetate (Eligard 22.5 mg) our patient developed abnormal lipid deposition particularly in his deltoid and abdominal region. His upper limb mobility gradually became compromised due to the size of these abnormal fat depositions. He had liposuction to correct this lipodystrophy and had a good functional outcome and cosmesis from the procedure.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of lipodystrophy secondary to leuprolide acetate injections. Leuprolide acetate in commonly used as one of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists and thus we should be mindful of the potential effect of producing lipodystrophy, especially in patients with cirrhosis, and to watch for any signs and symptoms as appropriate.

When KRT13 expression was determined at a single cell level in primary tumor tissues of 44 prostate cancer cases, KRT13 level predicted bone metastasis and the overall survival of prostate cancer patients. Genetically enforced KRT13 expression in human prostate cancer cell lines drove metastases toward mouse bone, brain and soft tissues through a RANKL-independent mechanism, as KRT13 altered the expression of genes associated with EMT, stemness, neuroendocrine/neuromimicry, osteomimicry, development, and extracellular matrices, but not receptor activator NF-κB ligand (RANKL) signaling networks in prostate cancer cells.

We investigated whether differential DNA methylation at the low CpG-content promoter (LCP) of DEFB1 was associated with transcriptional regulation of DEFB1 in PCa cells. To identify distinct CpG loci within the DEFB1 LCP related to the epigenetic regulation of DEFB1, we performed an in vitro methylated reporter assay followed by bisulfite sequencing of the DEFB1 promoter fragment. The methylation status of two adjacent CpG loci in the DEFB1 LCP was found to be important for DEFB1 expression in PCa cells. Paired epithelial specimens of PCa patients (n = 60), which were distinguished as non-tumor and tumor tissues by microdissection, were analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of site-specific CpG dinucleotide units in the DEFB1 LCP. CpG methylation frequencies in the DEFB1 LCP were significantly higher in malignant tissues than in adjacent benign tissues across almost all PCa patients. These results suggested that methylation status of each CpG site in the DEFB1 promoter could mediate downregulation of DEFB1 in PCa cells.""","""['Jaehyouk Lee', 'Jun Hyun Han', 'Ara Jang', 'Jin Wook Kim', 'Soon Auck Hong', 'Soon Chul Myung']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'Promoter CpG-Site Methylation of the KAI1 Metastasis Suppressor Gene Contributes to Its Epigenetic Repression in Prostate Cancer.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'WOMEN IN CANCER THEMATIC REVIEW: Diverse functions of DNA methylation: implications for prostate cancer and beyond.', 'Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals radiochemotherapy-induced innate immune activation and MHC-II upregulation in cervical cancer.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of Host Defense Peptide Synthesis: Synergy Between Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and DNA/Histone Methyltransferase Inhibitors.', 'Locus-Specific Methylation of GSTP1, RNF219, and KIAA1539 Genes with Single Molecule Resolution in Cell-Free DNA from Healthy Donors and Prostate Tumor Patients: Application in Diagnostics.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of Filaggrin Gene Expression in Human Epidermal Keratinocytes.', 'Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies a Novel Nine-RNA Signature to Improve Prognostic Prediction for Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Furthermore, the deregulation of AR activity is involved in the initiation of prostate cancer and contributes to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While AR degradation is known to occur primarily through a proteasome-mediated pathway, very little is known about how this process is regulated, especially in M phase. PC-1 is an androgen-responsive factor and expresses specificity in prostate cancer, with higher expression noted at G2/M. In this study, PC-1 was shown to interact with AR and E3 ligase CHIP (Carboxy-terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein) and to enhance AR/CHIP interactions, thereby decreasing AR stability. Moreover, PC-1 was found to act in conjunction with CHIP in the decreasing of AR via ubiquitination, with the subsequent degradation predominantly occurring during M phase. PC-1 was also found to repress AR transcriptional activity in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and attenuate the growth inhibition of AR.

The use of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, which has been suggested as a predictive biomarker, however, is confounded by multiple unresolved issues. The aim of this study therefore was to quantify PD-L1 DNA methylation (mPD-L1) in prostate tissue samples and to evaluate its potential as a biomarker in prostate cancer (PCa).  Results:   In the training cohort, normal tissue showed significantly lower levels of mPD-L1 compared to tumor tissue. High mPD-L1 in PCa was associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in univariate Cox proportional hazards (hazard ratio (HR)=2.60 [95%CI: 1.50-4.51], p=0.001) and Kaplan-Meier analyses (p<0.001). These results were corroborated in an independent validation cohort in univariate Cox (HR=1.24 [95%CI: 1.08-1.43], p=0.002) and Kaplan-Meier analyses (p=0.029). Although mPD-L1 and PD-L1 protein expression did not correlate in the validation cohort, both parameters added significant prognostic information in bivariate Cox analysis (HR=1.22 [95%CI: 1.05-1.42], p=0.008 for mPD-L1 and HR=2.58 [95%CI: 1.43-4.63], p=0.002 for PD-L1 protein expression).  Methods:   mPD-L1 was analyzed in a training cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=498) and was subsequently measured in an independent validation cohort (n=299) by quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR.

This report provides the first evidence of methuosis in EWS, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by an antibody directed against the CD99 molecule. Upon mAb triggering, CD99 induces an IGF-1R/RAS/Rac1 complex, which is internalized into RAB5-positive endocytic vacuoles. This complex is then dissociated, with the IGF-1R recycling to the cell membrane while CD99 and RAS/Rac1 are sorted into immature LAMP-1-positive vacuoles, whose excessive accumulation provokes methuosis. This process, which is not detected in CD99-expressing normal mesenchymal cells, is inhibited by disruption of the IGF-1R signaling, whereas enhanced by IGF-1 stimulation. Induction of IGF-1R/RAS/Rac1 was also observed in the EWS xenografts that respond to anti-CD99 mAb, further supporting the role of the IGF/RAS/Rac1 axis in the hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis and selective death of EWS cells. Thus, we describe a vulnerability of EWS cells, including those resistant to standard chemotherapy, to a treatment with anti-CD99 mAb, which requires IGF-1R/RAS signaling but bypasses the need for their direct targeting.

HDR-BT was administered in two treatment sessions (one week interval) with 9 Gy per fraction using a planning system and the Ir192 treatment unit GammaMed Plus iX. EBRT was performed with CT-based 3D-conformal treatment planning with a total dose administration of 50.4 Gy with 1.8 Gy per fraction and five fractions per week. Follow-up for all patients was organized one, three, and five years after radiation therapy to evaluate early and late toxicity side effects, metastases, local recurrence, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value measured in ng/mL. The evaluated data included age, PSA at time of diagnosis, PSA density, BMI (body mass index), Gleason score, D'Amico risk classification for PCa, digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA value after one/three/five year(s) follow-up (FU), time of follow-up, TNM classification, prostate volume, and early toxicity rates. Early toxicity rates were 8.86% for gastrointestinal, and 6.33% for genitourinary side effects. Of all treated patients, 84.81% had no side effects. All reported complications in early toxicity were grade 1. PSA density at time of diagnosis (p = 0.009), PSA on date of first HDR-BT (p = 0.033), and PSA on date of first follow-up after one year (p = 0.025) have statistical significance on a higher risk to get a local recurrence during follow-up. HDR-BT in combination with additional EBRT in the presented design for high-risk PCa results in high biochemical control rates with minimal side-effects.

In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which ANXA1 regulates metastatic behavior in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells exposed to hypoxia. ANXA1 was differentially expressed by PCa cell lines in normoxia whereas hypoxic stimuli resulted in a significant increase of protein expression. Additionally, in low oxygen conditions ANXA1 was extensively secreted out-side the cells where its binding to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) induced cell invasion. Loss and gain of function experiments performed by using the RNA interfering siANXA1 and an ANXA1 over-expressing plasmid (MF-ANXA1), also confirmed the leading role of the protein in modulating LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cell invasiveness. Finally, ANXA1 played a crucial role in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics underlying metastatization process, such as the loss of adhesion molecules and the occurrence of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ANXA1 expression increased inversely to epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and cytokeratins 8 and 18 (CKs) and proportionally to mesenchymal ones such as vimentin, ezrin and moesin.

Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 292 of 596 patients (49%). Intraprostatic CII was detected in 26.3% of cases.

Cell growth was measured by MTT, and the apoptosis was detected by the flow cytometry. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, and mTOR were tested by western blotting assay.

Our approach toward understanding the molecular events that lead to cancer is to characterize changes in transcriptional regulatory networks between normal and tumor tissue. Because enhancer activity is thought to be critical in regulating cell fate decisions, we have focused our studies on distal regulatory elements and transcription factors that bind to these elements.  Results:   Using DNA methylation data, we identified more than 25,000 enhancers that are differentially activated in breast, prostate, and kidney tumor tissues, as compared to normal tissues. We then developed an analytical approach called Tracing Enhancer Networks using Epigenetic Traits that correlates DNA methylation levels at enhancers with gene expression to identify more than 800,000 genome-wide links from enhancers to genes and from genes to enhancers. We found more than 1200 transcription factors to be involved in these tumor-specific enhancer networks. We further characterized several transcription factors linked to a large number of enhancers in each tumor type, including GATA3 in non-basal breast tumors, HOXC6 and DLX1 in prostate tumors, and ZNF395 in kidney tumors. We showed that HOXC6 and DLX1 are associated with different clusters of prostate tumor-specific enhancers and confer distinct transcriptomic changes upon knockdown in C42B prostate cancer cells.

This double blind placebo controlled study evaluates the effects of cranberry consumption on PSA values and other markers in men with PCa before radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Prior to surgery, 64 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a cranberry or placebo group. The cranberry group (n=32) received a mean 30 days of 1500 mg cranberry fruit powder. The control group (n=32) took a similar amount of placebo. Selected blood/urine markers as well as free and total phenolics in urine were measured at baseline and on the day of surgery in both groups. Prostate tissue markers were evaluated after surgery.  Results:   The serum PSA significantly decreased by 22.5% in the cranberry arm (n=31, P<0.05). A trend to down-regulation of urinary beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB) and serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, as well as upregulation of IGF-1 was found after cranberry supplementation. There were no changes in prostate tissue markers or, composition and concentration of phenolics in urine.

We also analyzed the levels of Zn-exporters in a panel of PCa cells derived from EA and AA populations. We further explored the expression profile of Zn-exporters in PCa using Oncomine database. Zn-exporters were found to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level, with a significant upregulation of SLC30A1, SLC30A9 and SLC30A10, and downregulation of SLC30A5 and SLC30A6 in PCa, compared to benign prostate. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway analysis revealed several interactions of Zn-exporters with certain tumor suppressor and promoter proteins known to be modulated in PCa.

We previously reported that elevated miR-375 levels were significantly associated with poor overall survival of mCRPC patients. In this study, we evaluated if miR-375 induced chemo-resistance to docetaxel through regulating target genes associated with drug resistance.  Methods:   We first compared miR-375 expression level between prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate tissues using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To examine the role of miR-375 in docetaxel resistance, we transfected miR-375 using a pre-miRNA lentiviral vector and examined the effects of exogenously overexpressed miR-375 on cell growth in two prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. To determine the effect of overexpressed miR-375 on tumor growth and chemo-resistance in vivo, we injected prostate cancer cells overexpressing miR-375 into nude mice subcutaneously and evaluated tumor growth rate during docetaxel treatment. Lastly, we utilized qRT-PCR and Western blot assay to examine two miR-375 target genes, SEC23A and YAP1, for their expression changes after miR-375 transfection.  Results:   By examining 495 tumor tissues and 52 normal tissues from TCGA data, we found that compared to normal prostate, miR-375 was significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues (8.45-fold increase, p value = 1.98E-23). Docetaxel treatment induced higher expression of miR-375 with 5.83- and 3.02-fold increases in DU145 and PC-3 cells, respectively. Interestingly, miR-375 appeared to play a dual role in prostate cancer proliferation. While miR-375 overexpression caused cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis, elevated miR-375 also significantly reduced cell sensitivity to docetaxel treatment in vitro, as evidenced by decreased apoptotic cells. In vivo xenograft mouse study showed that tumors with increased miR-375 expression were more tolerant to docetaxel treatment, demonstrated by greater tumor weight and less apoptotic cells in miR-375 transfected group when compared to empty vector control group. In addition, we examined expression levels of the two miR-375 target genes (SEC23A and YAP1) and observed significant reduction in the expression at both protein and mRNA levels in miR-375 transfected prostate cancer cell lines. TCGA dataset analysis further confirmed the negative correlations between miR-375 and the two target genes (r = -0.62 and -0.56 for SEC23A and YAP1, respectively; p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   miR-375 is involved in development of chemo-resistance to docetaxel through regulating SEC23A and YAP1 expression. Our results suggest that miR-375 or its target genes, SEC23A or YAP1, might serve as potential predictive biomarkers to docetaxel-based chemotherapy and/or therapeutic targets to overcome chemo-resistance in mCRPC stage.""","""['Yuan Wang', 'Rachel Lieberman', 'Jing Pan', 'Qi Zhang', 'Meijun Du', 'Peng Zhang', 'Marja Nevalainen', 'Manish Kohli', 'Niraj K Shenoy', 'Hui Meng', 'Ming You', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'Downregulation of Sec23A protein by miRNA-375 in prostate carcinoma.', 'microRNA-323 upregulation promotes prostate cancer growth and docetaxel resistance by repressing p73.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'The emerging role of miR-375 in cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNAs: Potential as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'Targeting XPO6 inhibits prostate cancer progression and enhances the suppressive efficacy of docetaxel.', 'Methods to Evaluate Changes in Mitochondrial Structure and Function in Cancer.', 'Increased SEC23A Expression Correlates with Poor Prognosis and Immune Infiltration in Stomach Adenocarcinoma.']"""

This unexpected and serious adverse side effect of PDE-5 inhibitors was scrutinized on the basis of patients in our prospective tumor database.  Materials and methods:   We included 358 patients after radical prostatectomy with bilateral nerve-sparing and without neo- or adjuvant therapy during 2004 and 2015. In all, 65.9% of the patients regularly took PDE-5 inhibitors postoperatively, 34.1% did not. Patients with sporadic use were excluded from the primary analysis. We used Kaplan-Mayer analysis to compare biochemical recurrence rates in both groups (endpoint: PSA > 0.2 ng/ml or salvage therapy).  Results:   Both groups showed comparable clinical parameters. There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival (p = 0.9334): 60 months postoperatively 90.4% of men with PDE-5 intake vs. 90.8% of men without intake of PDE-5 inhibitors were recurrence-free.

The necessity of a non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of PCa in early stage has grown through years. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (1H-MRSI) are advanced magnetic resonance techniques that can mark the presence of metabolites such as citrate, choline, creatine and polyamines in a selected voxel, or in an array of voxels (in MRSI) inside prostatic tissue. Abundance or lack of these metabolites can discriminate between pathological and healthy tissue. Although the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is well established in brain and liver with dedicated software for spectral analysis, quantification of metabolites in prostate can be very difficult to achieve, due to poor signal to noise ratio and strong J-coupling of the citrate. The aim of this work is to develop a software prototype for automatic quantification of citrate, choline and creatine in prostate. Its core is an original fitting routine that makes use of a fixed step gradient descent minimization algorithm (FSGD) and MRS simulations developed with the GAMMA libraries in C++. The accurate simulation of the citrate spin systems allows to predict the correct J-modulation under different NMR sequences and under different coupling parameters. The accuracy of the quantifications was tested on measurements performed on a Philips Ingenia 3T scanner using homemade phantoms.

In addition, data were characterized with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), which provide the relative risk of death compared with all persons.  Results:   The greatest relative decrease in index-cancer death (generally from > 60% to < 30%) was among those with cancers of the testis, kidney, bladder, endometrium, breast, cervix, prostate, ovary, anus, colorectum, melanoma, and lymphoma. Index-cancer deaths were stable (typically >40%) among patients with cancers of the liver, pancreas, esophagus, and lung, and brain. Noncancer causes of death were highest in patients with cancers of the colorectum, bladder, kidney, endometrium, breast, prostate, testis; >40% of deaths from heart disease. The highest SMRs were from nonbacterial infections, particularly among <50-year olds (e.g. SMR >1,000 for lymphomas, P < 0.001). The highest SMRs were typically within the first year after cancer diagnosis (SMRs 10-10,000, P < 0.001). Prostate cancer patients had increasing SMRs from Alzheimer's disease, as did testicular patients from suicide.

However, the role for MUC1 in occurrence and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remained elusive. In this study, we showed that solamargine, a major steroidal alkaloid glycoside, inhibited the growth of CRPC cells, which was enhanced in the presence of metformin. Furthermore, we found that solamargine increased phosphorylation of AMPKα, whereas reducing the protein expression and promoter activity of MUC1. A greater effect was observed in the presence of metformin. In addition, solamargine reduced NF-κB subunit p65 protein expression. Exogenously expressed p65 resisted solamargine-reduced MUC1 protein and promoter activity. Interestingly, exogenously expressed MUC1 attenuated solamargine-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPKα and, more importantly reversed solamargine-inhibited cell growth. Finally, solamargine increased phosphorylation of AMPKα, while inhibiting MUC1, p65 and tumor growth were observed in vivo.

We investigated the associations between age, BMI, PSA, and screen-detected prostate cancer to determine whether an age-BMI-adjusted PSA model would be clinically useful for detecting prostate cancer.  Methods:   Cross-sectional analysis nested within the UK ProtecT trial of treatments for localized cancer. Of 18,238 men aged 50-69 years, 9,457 men without screen-detected prostate cancer (controls) and 1,836 men with prostate cancer (cases) met inclusion criteria: no history of prostate cancer or diabetes; PSA < 10 ng/ml; BMI between 15 and 50 kg/m2. Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between log-PSA, age, and BMI in all men, controlling for prostate cancer status.  Results:   In the 11,293 included men, the median PSA was 1.2 ng/ml (IQR: 0.7-2.6); mean age 61.7 years (SD 4.9); and mean BMI 26.8 kg/m2 (SD 3.7). There were a 5.1% decrease in PSA per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI (95% CI 3.4-6.8) and a 13.6% increase in PSA per 5-year increase in age (95% CI 12.0-15.1). Interaction tests showed no evidence for different associations between age, BMI, and PSA in men above and below 3.0 ng/ml (all p for interaction >0.2).

Results:   Diabetes was not associated with high aggressive prostate cancer in the overall sample (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79, 1.37), White Americans (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.65, 1.57) or Black Americans (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.75, 1.53). Obesity, independent of diabetes, was positively associated with high aggressive prostate cancer in White Americans (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.14, 3.43), but not in the overall sample (OR 1.37; 95% CI 0.99, 1.92) or Black Americans (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.71, 1.67).

Our aim was to better understand the treatment decision process from all these perspectives.  Methods:   A mixed methods multi-perspective longitudinal study using semi-structured interviews and surveys with 29 OAs aged ≥70 years with advanced prostate, breast, colorectal, or lung cancer, 24 of their family members,13 oncologists, and 15 family physicians was conducted. The sample was stratified on age (70-79 and 80+). All interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.  Results:   There was no difference in the treatment decision-making experience based on age. Most OAs felt that they should have the final say in the treatment decision, but strongly valued their oncologists' opinion. ""Trust in my oncologist"" and ""chemotherapy as the last resort to prolong life"" were the most important reasons to accept treatment. Families indicated a need to improve communication between them, the patient and the specialist, particularly around goals of treatment. Comorbidity and potential side-effects did not play a major role in the treatment decision-making for patients, families, or oncologists. Family physicians reported no involvement in decisions but desired to be more involved.  Conclusion:   This first study using multiple perspectives showed neither frailty nor comorbidity played a role in the treatment decision-making process. Efforts to improve communication were identified as an opportunity that may enhance quality of care. In a mixed methods study multiple perspective study with older adults with cancer, their family members, their oncologist and their family physician we explored the treatment decision making process and found that most older adults were satisfied with their decision.

A prospective cohort study was conducted on 222 CHC patients with SVR. Eighty-two age-matched male genotype 1 (G1) and G2 patients underwent paired serum metabolomics analyses with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to examine AAs before and 24 weeks after anti-HCV therapy. Before anti-HCV therapy, G1 patients had a higher HCV RNA level than G2 patients. Twenty-four weeks post-therapy versus pre-therapy, repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the levels of alanine aminotransferase and most AAs decreased while those of lipids, glutamine and putrescine increased in CHC patients. The methionine sulfoxide/methionine ratio decreased, while the asymmetric dimethylarginine/arginine, glutamine/glutamate, citrulline/arginine, ornithine/arginine, kynurenine/tryptophan, tyrosine/phenylalanine and Fisher's ratios increased. Genotype-specific subgroup analyses showed that valine and serotonin/tyrosine increased in G1 and that kynurenine and tyrosine/phenylalanine increased and sarcosine decreased in G2 patients. Viral clearance in CHC patients pan-genotypically restored fuel utilization by decelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Following improvement in liver function, the urea, nitric oxide, methionine, and polyamine cycles were accelerated. The cardiometabolic risk attenuated, but the augmented kynurenine pathway activity could increase the oncogenesis risk. The trends in neurotransmitter formation differed between G1 and G2 patients after SVR. Moreover, the HCV-suppressing effect of valine was evident in G1 patients; with the exception of prostate cancer, the oncogenesis risk increased, particularly in G2 patients, at least within 24 weeks post-anti-HCV therapy.""","""['Ming-Ling Chang', 'Mei-Ling Cheng', 'Su-Wei Chang', 'Hsiang-Yu Tang', 'Cheng-Tang Chiu', 'Chau-Ting Yeh', 'Ming-Shi Shiao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Recovery of lipid metabolic alterations in hepatitis C patients after viral clearance: Incomplete restoration with accelerated ω-oxidation.', 'Association between Leptin and Complement in Hepatitis C Patients with Viral Clearance: Homeostasis of Metabolism and Immunity.', 'Dynamics of serum metabolites in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving pegylated interferon plus ribavirin: a metabolomics analysis.', 'Hepatitis C virus selectively perturbs the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway in a genotype-specific manner.', 'Meta-analysis: the outcome of anti-viral therapy in HCV genotype 2 and genotype 3 infected patients with chronic hepatitis.', 'Hepatitis C: Problems to extinction and residual hepatic and extrahepatic lesions after sustained virological response.', 'Hepatitis C-associated late-onset schizophrenia: a nationwide, population-based cohort study.', 'Liver-related effects of chronic hepatitis C antiviral treatment.', 'Metabolic Signature of Hepatic Fibrosis: From Individual Pathways to Systems Biology.', 'Robust Regression Analysis of GCMS Data Reveals Differential Rewiring of Metabolic Networks in Hepatitis B and C Patients.']"""

Methods:   Target-biopsy of six differently sized and located lesions was performed on customized CIRS 070L prostate phantoms. Lesions were only MRI-visible. After prior MRI for lesion location, one targeted biopsy per lesion was obtained by TRB with elastic image fusion with Artemis™ (Eigen, USA), TRB with rigid image fusion with real-time virtual sonography (Hitachi, Japan) and TPB with rigid image fusion with a brachytherapy approach (Elekta, Sweden), each on a phantom of 50, 100 and 150 ml prostate volume. The needle trajectories were marked by contrast agent and detected in a postinterventional MRI.  Results:   Overall target detection rate was 79.6% with a slight superiority for the TPB (83.3 vs. 77.8 vs. 77.8%). TRB with elastic image fusion showed the highest overall precision [median distance to lesion center 2.37 mm (0.14-4.18 mm)], independent of prostate volume. Anterior lesions were significantly more precisely hit than transitional and basal lesions (p = 0.034; p = 0.015) with comparable accuracy for TRB with elastic image fusion and TPB. In general, TRB with rigid image fusion was inferior [median 3.15 mm (0.37-10.62 mm)], particularly in small lesions.

Objectives:   This study examines the extent to which the cT and the pT category correspond to each other and whether the two categories differ in their prediction for organ-confined disease.  Patients and methods:   Data of 687 RP patients were collected in a prospective, noninterventional, multicenter health service research study for the treatment of localized PCa (HAROW).

Radiomics along with deformable co-registration tools can be used to develop a framework to generate targeted focal radiotherapy treatment plans.  Methods:   The Rad-TRaP framework comprises three distinct modules. Firstly, a module for radiomics based detection of PCa lesions on mpMRI via a feature enabled machine learning classifier. The second module comprises a multi-modal deformable co-registration scheme to map tissue, organ, and delineated target volumes from MRI onto CT. Finally, the third module involves generation of a radiomics based dose plan on MRI for brachytherapy and on CT for EBRT using the target delineations transferred from the MRI to the CT.  Results:   Rad-TRaP framework was evaluated using a retrospective cohort of 23 patient studies from two different institutions. 11 patients from the first institution were used to train a radiomics classifier, which was used to detect tumor regions in 12 patients from the second institution. The ground truth cancer delineations for training the machine learning classifier were made by an experienced radiation oncologist using mpMRI, knowledge of biopsy location and radiology reports. The detected tumor regions were used to generate treatment plans for brachytherapy using mpMRI, and tumor regions mapped from MRI to CT to generate corresponding treatment plans for EBRT. For each of EBRT and brachytherapy, 3 dose plans were generated - whole gland homogeneous ([Formula: see text]) which is the current clinical standard, radiomics based focal ([Formula: see text]), and whole gland with a radiomics based focal boost ([Formula: see text]). Comparison of [Formula: see text] against conventional [Formula: see text] revealed that targeted focal brachytherapy would result in a marked reduction in dosage to the OARs while ensuring that the prescribed dose is delivered to the lesions. [Formula: see text] resulted in only a marginal increase in dosage to the OARs compared to [Formula: see text]. A similar trend was observed in case of EBRT with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] compared to [Formula: see text].  Conclusions:   A radiotherapy planning framework to generate targeted focal treatment plans has been presented. The focal treatment plans generated using the framework showed reduction in dosage to the organs at risk and a boosted dose delivered to the cancerous lesions.""","""['Rakesh Shiradkar', 'Tarun K Podder', 'Ahmad Algohary', 'Satish Viswanath', 'Rodney J Ellis', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Regression and statistical shape model based substitute CT generation for MRI alone external beam radiation therapy from standard clinical MRI sequences.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of ablative dose escalated focal monotherapy with MRI-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Centre-specific autonomous treatment plans for prostate brachytherapy using cGANs.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance image guided brachytherapy.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'Prediction of high infiltration levels in pituitary adenoma using MRI-based radiomics and machine learning.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'The role of MRI in prostate cancer: current and future directions.']"""

MUC1 expression has been previously reported to independently predict aggressive localized prostate cancer. We used a large cohort to validate whether MUC1 protein levels measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) predict aggressive cancer, recurrence and survival outcomes after radical prostatectomy independent of clinical and pathological parameters.  Material and methods:   MUC1 IHC was performed on a multi-institutional tissue microarray (TMA) resource including 1,326 men with a median follow-up of 5 years. Associations with clinical and pathological parameters were tested by the Chi-square test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Relationships with outcome were assessed with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and the Log-rank test.  Results:   The presence of MUC1 expression was significantly associated with extracapsular extension and higher Gleason score, but not with seminal vesicle invasion, age, positive surgical margins or pre-operative serum PSA levels. In univariable analyses, positive MUC1 staining was significantly associated with a worse recurrence free survival (RFS) (HR: 1.24, CI 1.03-1.49, P = 0.02), although not with disease specific survival (DSS, P>0.5). On multivariable analyses, the presence of positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, as well as higher pre-operative PSA and increasing Gleason score were independently associated with RFS, while MUC1 expression was not. Positive MUC1 expression was not independently associated with disease specific survival (DSS), but was weakly associated with overall survival (OS).

Here, the role of Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT for the detection of PSMA expression in patients with metastasized differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) was evaluated.  Methods:   Six patients with iodine-negative and F-FDG-positive metastasized DTC (mean TG, 1616 ng/mL) received 71-93 MBq of the Ga-labeled PSMA ligand and underwent PET/CT at 62 ± 7 minutes p.i.. Tumor accumulation capacity of the tracer and the detection rate of local recurrences and metastases were compared with F-FDG. Tracer uptake was quantified in terms of the SUVmax.  Results:   In 5 of 6 patients, sites of putative metastatic disease could be identified using Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT. All lesions detected with Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT (n = 42) were confirmed by F-FDG PET/CT or conventional CT imaging. Using Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT, all tumor lesions identified with F-FDG PET/CT imaging could be visualized in 3 of 5 patients. In 2 patients, only the most prominent lesions detected with F-FDG PET/CT imaging were visualized by Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT. Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA uptake ranged from low in 1 patient (mean SUVmax 3.3) to intermediate (1 patient; mean SUVmax, 6.1) to intense (3 patients; mean SUVmax, 12.8, 16.2, and 18.3).

The mean of age, PSA, NLR, NMR values in the group 1 and 2 were respectively 64.6±7.7 and 61.6±6.9, 6.5±1.9 and 5.3±1.2, 2.8±1.5 and 2.3±1.1, 9.2±3.9, 8.1±2.9 (p=0.03, p=0.001, p=0.012 and p=0.30). The mean PSA, NLR ,NMR values of the group 1 were significantly higher than those in group 2 (p=0.002). Gleason grade and pathological stage were significantly increases as NLR increases.  Conclusion:   NLR and NMR in patients with BPH after second TRUS-guided biopsy were lower than that of those with a diagnosis of prostate cancer after the first TRUS-guided biopsy.White blood test subtypes can be considered for the decision to perform a second TRUSguided biopsy in patients with previous negative biopsy with persistently elevated PSA.""","""['Yasin Ceylan', 'Bülent Günlüsoy', 'Tansu Degirmenci', 'Deniz Bolat', 'Zafer Kozacioglu', 'Enver Vardar', 'Yusuf Kadir Topçu', 'Salih Polat']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['A retrospective comparison between transrectal and transperineal prostate biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'The Efficacy of Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy Versus Transperineal Template Biopsy of the Prostate in Diagnosing Prostate Cancer in Men with Previous Negative Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy.', 'Detection of prostatic carcinoma: the role of TRUS, TRUS guided biopsy, digital rectal examination, PSA and PSA density.', 'Prostate-specific antigen as a marker of prostate disease.', 'A guide to the interpretation of serum prostate specific antigen levels.']"""

However, GS 7 with tertiary Gleason pattern 5 (TGP5) was not incorporated in the new grading system. In the present study, we validated the prognostic role of TGP5 in the new classification.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1396 patients with localized GS 6-8 PC (pT2-3N0M0) who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2005 and 2014. After excluding patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or had incomplete pathological or follow-up data, 1229 patients were included in the final analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate and compare the probabilities of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Cox regression models were used to investigate associations between variables and the risk of BCR.  Results:   Of 732 GS 7 patients, 75 (10.2%) had a TGP5. The BCR-free survival rate for men with TGP5 was significantly worse than for those without TGP5 (P<0.001). In multivariate Cox regression analyses for GS 7 PC, TGP5 was a significant predictor of BCR (hazard ratio 1.750, P=0.027). When the total cohort was stratified into four grade groups according to the new classification, group 2 with TGP5 had a BCR risk comparable to group 3, and group 3 with TGP5 behaved like group 4.  Conclusions:   Our study shows that TGP5 increased the BCR risk after RP in GS 7 PC. Moreover, we demonstrated that the presence of a TGP5 in GS 7 upgraded the BCR risk to one comparable with the next higher category under the new classification. These findings support incorporating TGP5 into GS 7 to aid with future risk assessment and follow-up scheduling for PC.""","""['W S Jang', 'C Y Yoon', 'M S Kim', 'D H Kang', 'Y J Kang', 'W S Jeong', 'M J Abalajon', 'W S Ham', 'Y D Choi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Significance of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in patients with Gleason score 7 after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Validation of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in Gleason score 7 prostate cancer as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence and development of a prognostic model.', 'Oncologic outcomes of patients with Gleason score 7 and tertiary Gleason pattern 5 after radical prostatectomy.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Gleason Grade Group 5 in a Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System and Literature Review.', 'The 2019 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Clinical outcome comparison of Grade Group 1 and Grade Group 2 prostate cancer with and without cribriform architecture at the time of radical prostatectomy.', 'Practice Patterns in Reporting Tertiary Grades at Radical Prostatectomy: Survey of a Large Group of Experienced Urologic Pathologists.', 'Significance of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in patients with Gleason score 7 after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective cohort study.', 'The validation of the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system for patients with high-risk prostate cancer: a single-center retrospective study.']"""

Materials and methods:   We reviewed our prospectively maintained database of consecutive men who received prostate mpMRI at our institution, interpreted by a clinical practice of academic radiologists. Between January 2012 and December 2015, 84 men without any magnetic resonance imaging suspicious regions according to prior institutional classification, or with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 1-2 lesions according to the PI-RADS system, underwent standard template transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. Using these biopsy results, we calculated the NPV of mpMRI for the detection of PCa and identified patient risk factors for having a Gleason score ≥7 PCa on biopsy.  Results:   High-grade PCa (Gleason score ≥7) was found on TRUS biopsy in 10.3% of biopsy-naive patients (NPV=89.7%), 16.7% of patients with previous negative biopsy (NPV=83.3%), and 13.3% of patients on active surveillance (NPV=86.6%). On multivariate analysis, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPTRC) estimated risk for high-grade PCa (as a continuous variable) was a significant predictor for high-grade PCa on biopsy (odds ratio 1.01, P < .01).  Conclusion:   Men with negative mpMRIs interpreted in a routine clinical setting have a significant risk of harboring Gleason score ≥7 PCa on a standard 12-region template biopsy, independent of indication.

We hypothesized that a relationship might exist between KIF11 expression and PCa. To investigate the functional activities and clinical usefulness of KIF11 in PCa, we used quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to monitor the KIF11 expression patterns.  Materials and methods:   Tissue samples from 134 patients with PCa were analyzed using gene expression profiling and compared with tissues from 61 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. KIF11 expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and compared with indicators of tumor aggressiveness, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason score (GS), and tumor stage (TNM stage).  Results:   KIF11 mRNA expression in tissue was significantly greater in PCa patients with elevated serum PSA levels (≥ 10 ng/mL), GS ≥ 8 [58(43.3%)], T stage ≥ T3, or metastatic disease than in those with PSA levels < 10 ng/mL, GS of 7, or T2 stage.

Materials and methods:   Seventy-three patients with biopsy-proven PCa and previous RE assessment prospectively underwent mpMRI on a 3.0T magnet before external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Using Cohen's kappa statistic, we assessed the agreement between RE and mpMRI in defining the T-stage (≥T3 vs.T≤2) and risk category according to the National comprehensive cancer network criteria (≤intermediate vs. ≥high). We also calculated sensitivity and specificity for ≥T3 stage in an additional group of thirty-seven patients with post-prostatectomy histological examination (mpMRI validation group).  Results:   The agreement between RE and mpMRI in assessing the T stage and risk category was moderate (k=0.53 and 0.56, respectively). mpMRI changed the T stage and risk category in 21.9% (95%C.I. 13.4-33-4) and 20.5% (95%C.I. 12.3-31.9), respectively, prevalently downstaging PCa compared to RE.

Exclusion criteria were coagulation disorders, therapy with anticoagulant drugs, and acute infections of the urinary and the lower gastrointestinal tract. Directly after, one week and one year after the biopsy, we assessed biopsy related complications (e.g. hemorrhages or signs of prostatitis). Differences between patients with and without complications were analyzed regarding possible risk factors: age, prostate volume, number of taken samples, biopsy duration, biopsy of more than one lesion, diabetes, arterial hypertension, hemorrhoids, benign prostate hyperplasia, carcinoma or prostatitis (according to histopathological analysis), and lesion localization. Complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   We observed 15 grade I complications in 90 biopsies (16.7%) with slight hematuria in 9 cases (10%), minor vasovagal reactions in 4 cases (4.4%), and urinary retention and positioning-related facial dysesthesia in 1 case each (1.1%). One patient showed acute prostatitis requiring antibiotics as the only grade II complication (1.1%). There were no adverse events that occurred later than one week. Complications grade III or higher such as pelvic abscesses, urosepsis or severe hemorrhages were not seen. There were no significant associations between the assessed risk factors and biopsy-related complications.

Results:   A total of 163 patients were identified. The median age at first cancer diagnosis was 61 years. Sixteen (10%) had a family history of cancer, and 7 (4%) had a cancer-predisposing syndrome.

Forty-three percent developed 4 or more cancers. In univariate analyses, older age, male sex, smoking history, concurrent cancer, and stage IV disease were associated with worse survival; by contrast, breast cancer as the first cancer diagnosis yielded better survival. In multivariate analyses, older age, smoking history, and stage IV disease were associated with worse survival.

Most research on treatment disparities in men with prostate cancer has focused on race and socioeconomic factors. However, the geography of disparities - capturing racial and socioeconomic differences based on where patients live - can provide insight into barriers to care and help identify outlier areas in which access to care, health resources, or both are more pronounced.  Methods:   Research regarding treatment patterns and disparities in prostate cancer using the Geographical Information System (GIS) was searched. Studies were limited to English-language articles and research focused on US populations. A total of 43 articles were found; of those, 30 provided information about or used spatial or geographical analyses to assess and describe differences or disparities in prostate cancer and its treatment. Two additional GIS resources were included.  Results:   The research on geographical and spatial determinants of prostate cancer disparities was reviewed. We also examined geographical analyses at the state level, focusing on Florida. Overall, we described a geographical framework to disparities that affect men with prostate cancer and reviewed existing published evidence supporting the interplay of geographical factors and disparities in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Disparities in prostate cancer are common and persistent, and notable differences in treatment are observable across racial and socioeconomic strata. Geographical analysis provides additional information about where disparate groups live and also helps to map access to care.

We compared the mortality of Haitians and Jamaicans residing in Florida to populations in their countries of origin using Globocan.  Results:   We analyzed 185,113 cancer deaths from 2008 to 2012, of which 20,312 occurred in black populations.

Conclusions:   Race alone is not a determinant of cancer mortality. Among all analyzed races and ethnicities, including Whites and Hispanics, US-born blacks had the highest mortality rates while black Caribbeans had the lowest. The biggest intraracial difference was observed for lung cancer, for which US-blacks had nearly 4 times greater mortality risk than black Caribbeans.

The detection limit of ELISA is about 250 pg/ml. However, to quantify analytes that are related to various stages of tumors including early detection requires detecting well below the current limit of the ELISA test. For example, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels of early oral cancer patients are <100 pg/ml and the prostate specific antigen level of the early stage of prostate cancer is about 1 ng/ml. Further, it has been reported that there are significantly less than 1pg/mL of analytes in the early stage of tumors. Therefore, depending on the tumor type and the stage of the tumors, it is required to quantify various levels of analytes ranging from ng/ml to pg/ml. To accommodate these critical needs in the current diagnosis, there is a need for a technique that has a large dynamic range with an ability to detect extremely low levels of target analytes (<pg/ml).

One of the newly explored targets for the development of therapies against PCa is LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP-1). In the present study, the function of LASP-1 in the oncogenesis and metastasis of PCa was investigated using a series of in vitro experiments. Moreover, the mechanism through which LASP-1 exerted its effect on the carcinogenesis of PCa was also explored. The expression levels of LASP-1 in clinical PCa specimens were determined both at the mRNA and protein levels. Afterwards, the activity of LASP-1 in human PCa cell lines PC3 and DU145 was inhibited using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interfering method. The effects of LASP-1 knockdown on the cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, migration and invasion were assessed. It was demonstrated that the expression of LASP-1 was significantly higher in the clinical PCa tissues than the level in the corresponding para-carcinoma tissues. Following the knockdown of the LASP-1 gene in human PCa cell lines, the viability, migration and invasion of the cancer cells were decreased. It was also demonstrated that the change in the cell viability and motile ability were associated with an induction of cell apoptosis and G1 phase cell cycle arrest.

Previous findings showed that DEC served as apoptosis regulators of various cancer cell lines. However, little is known regarding the expression of DEC1 and DEC2 in prostate cancer cells. The present study aimed to examine the roles of DEC1 and DEC2 in human prostate cancer DU145 and PC-3 cells that were treated with paclitaxel. The expression of DEC1 and DEC2 was decreased in DU145 cells but was increased in PC-3 cells when treated with paclitaxel. DU145 cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel than PC-3 cells since the amount of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) reached its peak at 50 µM of paclitaxel in DU145 cells but at 100 µM in PC-3 cells. In addition, the amount of cleaved PARP was decreased by DEC1 siRNA, while it was increased by DEC2 siRNA in the presence of paclitaxel. Although DEC2 overexpression slightly inhibited cleaved PARP in the two cell lines, the effects of DEC1 overexpression on apoptosis remain to be determined. In conclusion, DEC1, at least partly, exerted a pro-apoptotic effect, whereas DEC2 exerted an anti-apoptotic effect in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Qiang Liu', 'Yunyan Wu', 'Tadashi Yoshizawa', 'Xu Yan', 'Satoko Morohashi', 'Hiroko Seino', 'Yukio Kato', 'Hiroshi Kijima']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors DEC1 and DEC2 regulate the paclitaxel-induced apoptotic pathway of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.', 'Anti-apoptotic effect of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor DEC2 in human breast cancer cells.', 'Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC1 regulates the cisplatin-induced apoptotic pathway of human esophageal cancer cells.', 'DEC1/STRA13/SHARP2 and DEC2/SHARP1 coordinate physiological processes, including circadian rhythms in response to environmental stimuli.', 'DEC1 and DEC2 Crosstalk between Circadian Rhythm and Tumor Progression.', 'Co-regulation of circadian clock genes and microRNAs in bone metabolism.', 'The HMGB1-2 Ovarian Cancer Interactome.

Two other trials were not confirmatory, however. Objective. We compared the change in serum metabolome of the ATBC Study participants randomized to receive vitamin E to those who were not by randomly selecting 50 men from each of the intervention groups (50 mg/day all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate (ATA), 20 mg/day β-carotene, both, placebo). Methods. Metabolomic profiling was conducted on baseline and follow-up fasting serum (Metabolon, Inc.). Results. After correction for multiple comparisons, five metabolites were statistically significantly altered (β is the change in metabolite level expressed as number of standard deviations on the log scale): α-CEHC sulfate (β = 1.51, p = 1.45 × 10-38), α-CEHC glucuronide (β = 1.41, p = 1.02 × 10-31), α-tocopherol (β = 0.97, p = 2.22 × 10-13), γ-tocopherol (β = -0.90, p = 1.76 × 10-11), and β-tocopherol (β = -0.73, p = 9.40 × 10-8). Glutarylcarnitine, beta-alanine, ornithine, and N6-acetyllysine were also decreased by ATA supplementation (β range 0.40 to -0.36), but not statistically significantly. Conclusions.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively catalogued 1021 consecutive patients before prostate biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). The risk of PCa and significant PCa (Gleason score ≥7) from 749 patients was calculated according to ERSPC-RC (digital rectal examination-based version 3 of 4) for 2 consecutive PSA tests per patient. The calculators' predictions were analyzed using calibration plots and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve). Cohen kappa coefficient was used to compare the ability and variability.  Results:   Of 749 patients, PCa was detected in 251 (33.5%) and significant PCa was detected in 133 (17.8%). Calibration plots showed an acceptable parallelism and similar discrimination ability for both PSA levels with an area under the curve of 0.69 for PCa and 0.74 for significant PCa. The ERSPC showed 226 (30.2%) unnecessary biopsies with the loss of 10 significant PCa. The variability of the RC was 16% for PCa and 20% for significant PCa, and a higher variability was associated with a reduced risk of significant PCa.  Conclusion:   We can conclude that the performance of the ERSPC-RC in the present cohort shows a high similitude between the 2 PSA levels; however, the RC variability value is associated with a decreased risk of significant PCa. The use of the ERSPC in our cohort detects a high number of unnecessary biopsies.

The purpose of this study was to investigate what factors influence prostate and colorectal cancer screening uptake among US-native born and foreign-born men. Using the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to highlight factors associated with the uptake of prostate and colorectal cancer screening among US-native born and foreign-born men. The sample size consisted of 5651 men respondents, with the mean age of 59.7 years (SD = 12.1). Of these, more than two-fifths (42%) were aged 50-64 years old. With respect to race/ethnicity, the sample was predominantly non-Hispanic Whites (65.5%), 863 (15.6%) Hispanics, and 710 (12.4%) Blacks. Our analysis found higher rates of both US-born and foreign-born men aged 65 years or older, who had either a PSA or CRC screening tests than those aged <65 years. Results of the general multivariate model suggest that men under 50 years old, US-born and foreign-born alike, are statistically significantly less likely to have prostate or colorectal cancer screenings than men aged 65 years or above. This study highlights the influencing factors that encourage or discourage PSA and CRC screening uptake between US-native born and foreign-born men.

The aim of this study was to define the ultrasonographic (US) patterns observed in SV invaded by prostate cancer (PCa), and propose an extended prostate biopsy protocol when SV invasion (SVI) is suspected.  Methods:   We reviewed 1.252 patients who underwent an initial transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for suspicious PCa. We performed a 14-core biopsy scheme, as first intention, including 1 SV sample on each side when SVI is suspected: a nodule at the base of prostate (determined by digital rectal examination or US) and/or an US pattern that suggests a SVI. US patterns of SVs were classified as abnormal by a variation of the body anterior-posterior diameter, asymmetry of the volume, parietal thickness, distance between the SVs and the rectal surface, and altered echogenicity of SVs and the base of the prostate.  Results:   Of the 137 biopsies performed in SVs, the SVI by PCa was diagnosed in 66.5% of candidate patients. The overall prevalence of SVI was 28.5%. No significant difference was noted between the patients with SVI and without SVI, when comparing age, prostate volume, and total core length, except for preoperative PSA serum levels. The sensitivity of any abnormal finding on transrectal ultrasound for the presence of SVI by PCa is 90.8%, whereas the specificity is 96%.

Design:   We had previously designed and synthesized commercially peptides corresponding to the human Ec and its mouse igf1 counterpart as well as synthetic peptides that correspond to parts of the hEc. Using proliferation and mitogenic signaling assays, we tested their effect on PC-3 cells and C2C12 myoblasts at different doses and in different culture conditions.  Results:   Human Ec, hEc, was documented as exerting progression but not competence growth factor actions, activating ERK1/2 without affecting Akt phosphorylation in PC-3 cells. A narrow concentration range of hEc (5-50nM) stimulated the growth of PC-3 cells grown in culture media supplemented with 10% FBS. hEc did not stimulate the growth of PC-3 cells cultured with media containing 0.5% FBS or in mouse C2C12 myoblasts under any culture conditions. The activity of hEc was blocked by a neutralizing anti-human IGF-1Ec antibody but not by a neutralizing anti-human IGF-1 receptor antibody. The synthetic mouse Ec was inactive in human PC-3 cells; however, it stimulated significantly the proliferation of mouse C2C12.

We previously reported the interim analysis of a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in patients with the basal-cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome indicating that the smoothened inhibitor vismodegib reduces basal-cell carcinoma tumour burden and prevents new basal-cell carcinoma growth in patients with basal-cell nevus syndrome. We report the final results of this 36 month trial.  Methods:   In our multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial we enrolled patients aged 35-75 years with basal-cell nevus syndrome with at least ten surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas at the Children's Hospital Oakland, Columbia University outpatient dermatology clinic (NY, USA) and a private practice outpatient dermatology office in Newport Beach (CA, USA). Patients were assigned to vismodegib or placebo (2:1) according to a randomisation sequence generated by computer code. The primary endpoint of the trial of 41 patients was to compare the effect of oral vismodegib (150 mg/day) versus placebo on the incidence of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas after 3 months of treatment. In the subsequent, open-label phase (n=37) patients continued vismodegib at two sites for as long as month 36 (n=25) and at the third site were monitored up to month 36 (n=12). Additional endpoints for this phase were: whether continuous versus interrupted dosing differentially affected tumour burden; time to reach various levels of reduction in tumour burden; reduction in tumour size in patients who took less than 50% of the expected number of vismodegib tablets; reduction in the number of surgical excisions required per year before, during, and after treatment; and the effect of vismodegib on hedgehog target gene expression. We monitored patients at visits every 3 months for up to 36 months. The primary endpoint was analysed on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00957229.  Findings:   Between Sept 22, 2009, and Jan 24, 2011, 41 patients were monitored for a median of 36 months (IQR 36-36). Patients treated with vismodegib (n=26) had a mean reduced rate of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo (n=15; two [SD 0·12] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year vs 34 [1·32] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year, p<0·0001). In the 11 patients initially assigned to placebo, mean cross over to vismodegib reduced the development of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas compared with placebo (0·4 [SD 0·2] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year vs 30·0 [7·8] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year, p<0·0001). Only three (17%) of 18 patients tolerated vismodegib continuously for the full 36 months. Fewer new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas developed in patients receiving vismodegib continuously than in those who interrupted dosing (mean 0·6 [0·72] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year vs 1·7 [1·8] new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per patient per year, p<0·0001). Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events included weight loss of 20% or more (n=6) and muscle cramps (n=2).

New biomarkers distinguishing indolent and aggressive prostate cancer are needed to improve precision medicine. In prostate cancer, protein kinase A (PKA) is known to activate the androgen receptor and published data indicate that PKA subunits can act as predictive markers for response to radiation and chemotherapy. We have previously shown that the catalytic subunit, Cβ2, of PKA is up-regulated in prostate cancer and we would in this study investigate the potential of Cβ2 to become a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data were sampled from a total of 241 patients from 3 independent cohorts. We measured and compared Cβ2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in prostate tumor and nontumor samples (n = 22), and exon levels in a cohort of 50 tumor samples, as well as acquiring mRNA data from the publicly available database The cancer genome atlas (n = 169).  Results:   Cβ2 mRNA was up-regulated in prostate cancer in all 3 cohorts, measured by 3 different methods. Furthermore, the relative Cβ2 mRNA expression levels were lower in prostate cancer samples with Gleason score 8 to 10 compared with samples with Gleason score<8 (P = 0.004). Finally, low expression of Cβ2 mRNA in prostate cancer biopsies correlated with poor survival (hazard ratio = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.048-0.86; P = 0.031), adjusted for risk group and age.

NDGA suppresses NRP1 function by downregulating its expression, which leads to attenuated cell motility, cell adhesion to ECM and FAK signaling in cancer cells. Moreover, due to its cross-cell type activity on NRP1 suppression, NDGA also impairs angiogenesis function of endothelial cells and fibronectin assembly by fibroblasts, both of which are critical to promote metastasis.

To study in further detail the paradoxical tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting roles of the TGF-β pathway, we investigated the effect of systemic treatment with a TGF-β inhibitor on early stages of prostate tumorigenesis. To ensure effective inhibition, we developed and employed a novel trivalent TGF-β receptor trap, RER, comprised of domains derived from the TGF-β type II and type III receptors. This trap was shown to completely block TβRII binding, to antagonize TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 signaling in cultured epithelial cells at low picomolar concentrations, and it showed equal or better anti-TGF-β activities than a pan TGF-β neutralizing antibody and a TGF-β receptor I kinase inhibitor in various prostate cancer cell lines. Systemic administration of RER inhibited prostate tumor cell proliferation as indicated by reduced Ki67 positive cells and invasion potential of tumor cells in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions in the prostate glands of Pten conditional null mice. These results provide evidence that TGF-β acts as a promoter rather than a suppressor in the relatively early stages of this spontaneous prostate tumorigenesis model.

Herein, phage display screening technology is utilized to obtain a GPC3 binding peptide (GBP) using HCC cells expressing GPC3 in varying abundances. After seven rounds of panning, a peptide with sequence of THVSPNQGGLPS is identified with 735.2 ± 53.6 × 10-9 m affinity to GPC3. The ability to target GPC3 in vivo is evaluated by intravenous injection of GBP labeled with a near-infrared dye, Cy5.5, into a HCC tumor-bearing mouse model.

Patients and methods:   A two centre prospective outcome study of 487 patients with previous benign biopsies that underwent transperineal MRI/US fusion-guided targeted and systematic saturation biopsy from 2012 to 2015. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) was reported according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Version 1. Detection of Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer on biopsy was the primary outcome. Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Detection rates of targeted and systematic biopsies were compared using McNemar's test.  Results:   The median (interquartile range) PSA level was 9.0 (6.7-13.4) ng/mL. PI-RADS 3-5 mpMRI lesions were reported in 343 (70%) patients and Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer was detected in 149 (31%). The PPV (95% CI) for detecting Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer was 0.20 (±0.07) for PI-RADS 3, 0.32 (±0.09) for PI-RADS 4, and 0.70 (±0.08) for PI-RADS 5.

The preoperative (interquartile range; range) median PSA level was 1.3 (0.57-2.53 ng/mL; 0.2-13.9 ng/mL). Results of ex vivo radioactivity rating (positive vs negative) of resected tissue specimens were compared with findings of postoperative histological analysis. Best PSA response without additional treatment was determined after 111 In-PSMA-RGS, and salvage-surgery-related postoperative complications and PCa-specific additional treatments were recorded.  Results:   In 30/31 patients, 111 In-PSMA-RGS allowed intra-operative identification of metastatic lesions.

Mass spectrometric analysis of FLAG immunoprecipitates of untreated and MG-132 treated FLAG-ILEI transfected cells indicated that UBE4A and UBE3C ubiquitin ligases were interacting with ILEI. Ectopic overexpression of UBE4A, but not UBE3C, resulted in destabilization of ILEI in LNCaP cells, whereas RNAi-mediated silencing of UBE4A in PCS-440-010, PC3 and DU145 cell lines resulted in robust accumulation of ILEI, indicating UBE4A as the cognate ubiquitin ligase for ILEI. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments established direct interaction of endogenous ILEI and UBE4A. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged ILEI in cells co-transfected with either HA-UBE4A or HA-UBE3C revealed robust polyubiquitinated smear of ILEI in cells transfected with UBE4A, but not UBE3C, thus confirming UBE4A as the ubiquitin ligase for ILEI degradation. Ectopic overexpression of UBE4A, but not UBE3C, in cells was downregulated in vitro migration and invasion in these cells.

Patients and methods:   In all, 115 patients were included. Patients with nocturnal UI, previous UI surgery, previous radiotherapy and a coaptive zone of <1 cm in the preoperative repositioning test were excluded. Postoperatively, a standardised 24-h pad test, quality-of-life scores [International Quality of Life score (IQOL) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire short form (ICIQ-UI SF)], visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score, were performed. All patients with a 0-5 g pad test were defined as cured and improved with a reduction of urine loss of >50%. All others were classified as failures. Significance analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test.  Results:   The mean (median) preoperative urine loss in the 24-h pad test was 272.0 (272.0) g.

A Study of the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry""","""Purpose:   We sought to determine whether further distance from a radiation center is associated with lower utilization of external beam radiation therapy (XRT).  Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients with a new diagnosis of localized prostate cancer (CaP) within the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2011. Patients were categorized by age, D'Amico risk category, year of treatment, marital status, season of diagnosis, urban/rural residence, and driving time to the nearest radiation facility. Treatment decisions were stratified into those requiring multiple trips (XRT) or a single trip (surgery or brachytherapy). Multivariable regression analysis was performed.  Results:   A total of 4,731 patients underwent treatment for newly diagnosed CaP during the study period, including 1,575 multitrip (XRT) and 3,156 single-trip treatments. Of these, 87.6% lived within a 30-minute drive to a radiation facility. In multivariable analysis, time to the nearest radiation facility was not associated with treatment decisions (P = .26). However, higher risk category, older age, married status, and winter diagnosis were associated with XRT (P < .05). More recent year of diagnosis and urban residence were associated with single-trip therapy (primarily surgery) (P < .05). There was a significant interaction between travel time and season of diagnosis (P = .03), as well as a marginally significant interaction with urban/rural status (P = .07).  Conclusion:   Overall, further travel time to a radiation facility was not associated with lower utilization of XRT.

Penile compression clamps (PCCs) which externally occlude the urethra may be used to manage the incontinence. Despite potential complication of PCCs, such as deformation-inflicted tissue damage, to date, there are no reported biomechanical criteria for design of PCCs, in terms of quantitative parameters for evaluating the safety-versus-efficacy of existing or future designs.  Methods:   We developed a set of computational three-dimensional models of the penis, to which compression was applied using five generic PCC designs. The internal mechanical states of the soft tissues of the penis were then analysed using finite element simulations.  Results:   Stresses in skin, fat, and tunica albuginea regularly exceeded 10 kPa (75 mmHg). Cuff-type and knurl-type PCCs pose the highest potential risks to tissue health with elevated tissue stresses around the entire penile perimeter (cuff) or urethral stress concentrations (knurl). The soft and contoured PCCs produced the lowest values of these mechanical parameters.  Conclusions:   The present study identified design characteristics, including envelopment, adaptability, and durability which provide the safest mechanical conditions in the penis and thus minimize the risk of tissue damage while still managing incontinence.

Experimental studies have shown that AGD is a biomarker of prenatal androgen exposure during the masculinisation period of development. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between anogenital distance (AGD), as an indirect marker of prenatal hormonal environment, and prostate cancer (PCa) severity.  Materials:   We conducted a cross-sectional study with a total of 120 PCa patients with confirmed biopsy of the tumour from April 2007 to July 2015. Two variants of the anogenital distance were assessed, from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGDAS ) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGDAP ). We compared differences in groups to evaluate the association between AGD measurements and severity of the preoperative biopsy and clinical scores.  Results:   Longer AGDAS was significantly associated with the highest Gleason score (P = 0.015) and D'Amico nomogram (P = 0.048). In contrast, no statistical differences were found in the AGDAP and severity of the preoperative biopsy.

Several models for tissue extraction from prostatectomy specimens without guidance by frozen sections are already introduced. However, little is known about the sampling efficacy of these models, which should provide representative tissue in adequate volumes, account for multifocality and heterogeneity of tumor, not violate the routine final pathological examination, and perform quickly without frozen section-based histological control. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sampling efficacy of the existing tissue extraction models without guidance by frozen sections (""blind"") and to develop an optimized model for tissue extraction.  Methods:   Five hundred thirty-three electronic maps of the tumor distribution in prostates from a single-center cohort of the patients subjected to radical prostatectomy were used for analysis. Six available models were evaluated in silico for their sampling efficacy. Additionally, a novel model achieving the best sampling efficacy was developed.  Results:   The available models showed high efficacies for sampling ""any part"" from the tumor (up to 100%), but were uniformly low in efficacy to sample all tumor foci from the specimens (with the best technique sampling only 51.6% of the all tumor foci). The novel 4-level extraction model achieved a sampling efficacy of 93.1% for all tumor foci.  Conclusions:   The existing ""blind"" tissue extraction models from prostatectomy specimens without frozen sections control are suitable to target tumor tissues but these tissues do not represent the whole tumor. The novel 4-level model provides the highest sampling efficacy and a promising potential for integration into routine.

However, the exact mechanisms of their anticancer actions remain unclear. Using microarrays, we discovered up-regulation of annexin A10 (ANXA10) in PC-3 cells after simvastatin treatment. ANXA10 reportedly has antitumor effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin on ANXA10 signaling in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   PC-3, LNCaP-LA (which were derived from LNCaP cells and cultured in 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 3 months), and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines were used. Prostate tissues were collected from 60 patients (benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], n = 20; prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7, n = 20; prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8-10, n = 20) at the time of prostate biopsies performed. We used a nude mouse tumor xenograft model with administration of simvastatin or phosphate-buffered saline via intraperitoneal injection.  Results:   Simvastatin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC-3, LNCaP-LA, and DU145 cells. The expression level of ANXA10 was up-regulated by simvastatin in PC-3, LNCaP-LA, and DU145 cells. Transfection with ANXA10 inhibited PC-3 and LNCaP-LA cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of ANXA10 by siRNA increased the proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP-LA cells. In a nude mouse xenograft model of PC-3 cells, simvastatin induced both reduction in the tumor size and up-regulation of ANXA10 expression. In human prostate biopsy samples, ANXA10 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the prostate cancer group than in the BPH group. Next, we found that up-regulation of ANXA10 in PC-3 resulted in down-regulation of S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), which is reportedly correlated with aggressiveness and a worse prognosis for patients with different types of carcinomas. Expression of S100A4 was down-regulated by simvastatin. In PC-3 cells, knockdown of S100A4 by siRNA inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that statins inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by up-regulation of ANXA10. Additionally, it is possible that S100A4 plays a role in these effects. Statins may be beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.

We sought to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tasquinimod in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone in men with chemorefractory mCRPC.  Methods:   Men with mCRPC who had failed prior docetaxel chemotherapy received cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with oral tasquinimod at 1 of 3 escalating dose levels (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg once daily) with prednisone and PEG-filgastrim support, using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Treatment continued until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  Results:   We enrolled 25 men with chemorefractory mCRPC. The RP2D was 0.5 mg tasquinimod based on excess DLTs (two of three men) observed at dose level 3 (1.0 mg) including grade 3 sensory neuropathy and grade 3 atrial fibrillation. Dose level 2 was expanded to 14 men, where 3 DLTs were observed: grade 3 fatigue, grade 4 febrile neutropenia, and grade 3 liver function abnormalities. The proportion of men with a ≥30% PSA decline was 63% and the median composite progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months (95% CI 4.2-16.4 months) based on 12 PFS events. The median number of cycles of cabazitaxel was 6 (range 1-13), with six men receiving >10 cycles. Best overall RECIST responses (CR + PR) were observed in three men (12%), with stable disease in 12 (48%). No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed.  Conclusions:   We determined the RP2D of tasquinimod combined with cabazitaxel to be 0.5 mg daily following a 3 week lead-in of tasquinimod 0.25 mg with growth factor support.

However, the relationship of GGT with prostate cancer risk is uncertain. We aimed to assess the prospective association of GGT with risk of prostate cancer. Serum GGT activity was assessed at baseline in the Finnish Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective cohort of 2,390 men aged 42-61 years without a history of cancer at baseline. We corrected for within-person variability in GGT values using data from repeat measurements taken several years apart. During a median follow-up of 24.6 years, 230 cases of prostate cancer occurred. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio for loge GGT was 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.74]. Serum GGT was nonlinearly associated with risk of prostate cancer. In age-adjusted Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio (95% CIs) for prostate cancer in a comparison of the top quartile versus bottom quartiles 1-3 of GGT values was 1.43 (1.07 to 1.93; p = 0.017), which persisted on adjustment for several established cancer risk factors 1.46 (1.06 to 2.02; p = 0.020). The association remained unchanged on further adjustment for total energy intake, socioeconomic status, physical activity and C-reactive protein.

Moreover, we found that MAZ had a relationship with zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 (ZEB1 and ZEB2), two important mesenchymal markers in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that were over-expressed in HCC. After knocking-down MAZ expression in HCC cell lines using RNA interruption, HCC cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, invasion and migration were significantly inhibited.

This study aimed to test the adequacy of this PTV expansion by assessing geographical miss of the prostate on post-treatment cone-beam CT (CBCT) and identify those at risk of geographical miss.  Methods:   Twenty-two prostate cancer patients receiving IGRT with implanted fiducial markers underwent daily pre-treatment orthogonal kV imaging followed by a post-treatment CBCT for a total of 432 fractions. The prostate was outlined on all CBCTs. For each imaging set, the volume of geographic miss was measured by subtracting the PTV from the planning CT and prostate volume on the post-treatment CBCT.  Results:   The prostate volume moved outside the PTV by >0.01 cc in 9% of fractions (39/432). This occurred in 13 (59%) of 22 patients. Large prostates >40 cc and >50 cc had significantly more geographical miss events (both P < 0.001). Changes in rectal filling appear to be responsible for prostate motion/deformation in 82% (32/39) of fractions.  Conclusions:   Our analysis suggests that, despite IGRT, prostate PTV margins are not adequate in some patients, particularly those with large prostates. PTV margins may be reduced in some other patients. Prostate rotation and deformation play an important role in setting margins and may not always be represented accurately by fiducial marker displacements. Individualised and adaptive margins for prostate cancer patients should be a priority for future research.""","""['Richard Oates', 'Daryl Jones', 'Farshad Foroudi', 'Suki Gill', 'Prabhakar Ramachandran', 'Michal Schneider', 'Michael Lim Joon', 'Tomas Kron']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Radiat Sci""","""['The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'A novel approach for evaluation of prostate deformation and associated dosimetric implications in IGRT of the prostate.', 'PTV margin definition in hypofractionated IGRT of localized prostate cancer using cone beam CT and orthogonal image pairs with fiducial markers.', 'Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty in prostate bed image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A systematic review of organ motion and image-guided strategies in external beam radiotherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Generating missing patient anatomy from partially acquired cone-beam computed tomography images using deep learning: a proof of concept.', 'Margins Matter: current radiation therapy practice and future directions.']"""

Patients with distant disease on AC-PET were treated with androgen deprivation/chemotherapy.  Results:   Of 103 patients, 42 were AC-PET-positive. PSA levels were <1.0, <2.0 and <4.0 ng/mL in six, 16 and 20 patients, respectively. In 25/42 patients AC-PET suggested lymph node metastases: 16/25 patients underwent surgery (10/16 metastasis, 6/16 inflammation); 9/25 patients underwent RT of lymph node metastases, which was followed by decreasing PSA level. In 17/42 patients who had distant disease, systemic treatment was commenced. Combining patients who underwent surgery and those who underwent RT, 19/25 patients were true-positive in terms of AC-PET (positive predictive value 76%). In 5/19 patients, PSA level was <2.0 ng/mL, in 2/19 patients it was <1.0 ng/mL and in 14/19 patients it was 5.4-23.1 ng/mL. In AC-PET-positive patients after surgery or RT (without androgen deprivation), median (range) time to renewed PSA increase was 6 (5-9) months.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging followed by three-dimensional transperineal template mapping biopsy was carried out. For imaging and pathology data, the prostate was divided in octants with the urethra being the midline. The index test properties were calculated using the biopsy histopathology as the reference test with the following end-points: any cancer, any Gleason ≥7, any Gleason ≥7 or cancer length of ≥4 mm and any Gleason ≥7 or 6 mm in any given core. The latter two definitions correspond to 0.2 and 0.5 mL of cancer volume, respectively. Diagnostic properties including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated.  Results:   A total of 50 patients were included in the study. A median of 55 (interquartile range 42-63) biopsy cores were obtained per patient. Of 400 prostate octants evaluated, 28.5% had prostate cancer on mapping biopsy, whereas 23% of octants were considered suspicious for cancer on imaging. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative predictive values for Gleason ≥7 and clinically significant cancers were 84-100%. Similarly, specificity ranged between 79% and 85%. Sensitivity and positive predictive value remained moderate for all the reference test definitions.

The p16INK4a /retinoblastoma protein (p16/Rb) pathway mediates stress-induced senescence, and is generally upregulated by primary epithelial cells in response to the artificial conditions from tissue culture. Replicative senescence is associated with telomere loss. Following each round of cell division, telomeres progressively shorten. Once telomeres shorten to a critical length, the DNA damage response pathway is activated, and the tumor suppressor p53 pathway triggers replicative senescence. Exogenous expression of telomerase in normal human epithelial cells extends the replicative capacity of cells, and in some cases, immortalizes cells. However reliable immortalization of epithelial cells usually requires telomerase activity coupled with inactivation of the p16/Rb pathway.  Methods:   A lentiviral vector, pLOX-TERT-iresTK (Addgene #12245), containing a CMV promoter upstream of a bicistronic coding cassette that includes loxP sites flanking the catalytic subunit of human telomerase gene (TERT) and herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase gene (HSV1-tk) was used to transduce normal prostate basal epithelial cells (PrECs) initiated in cell culture from prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomies.  Results:   Transduction of early (i.e., <7) passage PrECs with TERT led to successful immortalization. However, attempts to immortalize late (i.e., >7) passage PrECs were unsuccessful. Late passage PrECs, which acquired elevated p16, were unable to overcome the senescence barrier. Immortalized PrECs (TERT-PrECs) retained a normal male karyotype and low p16 expression. Additionally, TERT-PrECs were non-tumorigenic when inoculated into intact male immunodeficient NSG mice.  Conclusions:   The present studies document that early passage human PrECs have sufficiently low p16 to permit immortalization by TERT expression alone. TERT-PrECs developed using this transduction approach provides an appropriate and experimentally facile model for clarifying the molecular mechanism(s) involved in both immortalization of human PrECs, as well as identifying genetic/epigenetic ""drivers"" for conversion of these immortalized non-tumorigenic cells into fully lethal prostate cancers. Notably, loxP sites flank the exogenous TERT gene in the TERT-PrECs. Cre recombinase can be used to excise TERT, and resolve whether TERT expression is required for these cells to be fully transformed into lethal cancer.

Several studies have shown that inhibition of SRPK1 has anti-tumoural effects, and SRPK1 has therefore become a new candidate for targeted therapies. Interestingly, in terms of molecular mechanism, SRPK1 seems to act heterogeneously, and has been reported to affect several processes in different cancers, e.g. angiogenesis in prostate and colon cancer, apoptosis in breast and colon cancer, and migration in breast cancer. A recent report adds to this puzzle, showing that the main effect of SRPK1 overexpression in non-small-cell lung carcinoma is to stimulate a stem cell-like phenotype.

The extent to which health insurance can mitigate the effects of the social determinants of health on cancer care is unknown.  Methods:   This study linked the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to US Census data to study patients diagnosed with the 4 leading causes of cancer deaths between 2007 and 2011. A county-level social determinant score was developed with 5 measures of wealth, education, and employment. Patients were stratified into quintiles, with the lowest quintile representing the most disadvantaged communities. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations and cancer-specific survival.  Results:   A total of 364,507 patients aged 18 to 64 years were identified (134,105 with breast cancer, 106,914 with prostate cancer, 62,606 with lung cancer, and 60,882 with colorectal cancer). Overall, patients from the most disadvantaged communities (median household income, $42,885; patients below the poverty level, 22%; patients completing college, 17%) were more likely to present with distant disease (odds ratio, 1.6; P < .001) and were less likely to receive cancer-directed surgery (odds ratio, 0.8; P < .001) than the least disadvantaged communities (median income, $78,249; patients below the poverty level, 9%; patients completing college, 42%). The differences persisted across quintiles regardless of the insurance status. The effect of having insurance on cancer-specific survival was more pronounced in disadvantaged communities (relative benefit at 3 years, 40% vs 31%). However, it did not fully mitigate the effect of social determinants on mortality (hazard ratio, 0.75 vs 0.68; P < .001).  Conclusions:   Cancer patients from disadvantaged communities benefit most from health insurance, and there is a reduction in disparities in outcome. However, the gap produced by social determinants of health cannot be bridged by insurance alone.

Retrospective evidence supports the selective use of radiotherapy (RT) after extended pelvic lymph node dissection. It is unclear whether this is generalizable to practice in the United States, where extended dissection is uncommon. The authors identified patients with LNI who potentially could derive a survival benefit with adjuvant RT plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   Patients with N1M0 prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and subsequently received ADT from 2003 through 2011 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Kaplan-Meier analyses, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression were performed using overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome.  Results:   In total, 906 of 2569 eligible patients (35.3%) received RT, and RT was more frequently received by patients who were diagnosed in later years, had fewer positive lymph nodes, had involved surgical margins, and were aged <65 years (all P < .05). The 5-year OS rate was 87% versus 82% in those who received RT versus those who did not (P = .007). After propensity score matching, 826 patients remained in each cohort. RT retained an association with OS (5-year OS: 88% vs 81%; P = .009; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.86; P = .008).

Data of 662 patients who underwent prostate biopsy from January 2012 to June 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve analyses were performed to assess the predictive accuracy. Simultaneously, Youden's index was calculated to determine the optimal NLR cutoff. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between NLR value and PCa detection. On account of an NLR value of 2.44 was shown with the maximal Youden's index on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cutoff value of NLR was set at 2.44. Accordingly, patients were classified into high-NLR or low-NLR group. The patients in high-NLR group might have significant higher risk to be diagnosed with PCa (HR 1.640; P = 0.031), especially in the subgroup with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ranged from 4 to 10 ng mL (hazard ratio [HR] 4.364; P = 0.003). The high-NLR was independent of age of diagnosis, PSA, prostate volume, abnormal digital rectal examination, and hypoechoic lesion on transrectal ultrasound for positive prostate biopsy. In the so-called gray area, combination of NLR value could raise 4.6% of the accuracy of the multivariate logistic model in PCa prediction, but not in advanced PCa prediction.The patients with high-NLR value may have significant higher risk to be diagnosed with PCa, especially among the patients with PSA ranged from 4 to 10 ng mL. In this subgroup, the adding of NLR value in the multivariate model can improve the accuracy of PCa prediction in a large degree.

We demonstrated that cancer cells exhibited dormancy in a cell density-dependent manner not only in spheroids but also in 2D culture. Dormant cancer cells accumulated high PpIX levels and were sensitive to ALA-PDT. In dormant cancer cells, transporter expressions of PEPT1, ALA importer, and ABCB6, an intermediate porphyrin transporter, were upregulated and that of ABCG2, a PpIX exporter, was downregulated.

PSCs resistance to ADT and PSC expansion in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has sparked great interest in using differentiation therapy as an adjuvant to ADT. Understanding the mechanisms, by which PSCs maintain their undifferentiated phenotype, thus has important implications in differentiation therapy. In the prostate, the ATP binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) transporters, which enrich for AR-positive, ADT-resistant PSCs, play an important role in regulating the intracellular androgen levels by effluxing androgens. We hypothesized that the ABCG2-mediated androgen efflux is responsible for maintaining PSCs in an undifferentiated state. Using the HPr-1-AR (nontumorigenic) and CWR-R1 (tumorigenic) prostate cell lines, it was demonstrated that inhibiting the ABCG2-mediated androgen efflux, with Ko143 (ABCG2 inhibitor), increased the nuclear AR expression due to elevated intracellular androgen levels. Increased nuclear translocation of AR is followed by increased expression of AR regulated genes, a delayed cell growth response, and increased luminal differentiation. Furthermore, Ko143 reduced tumor growth rates in mice implanted with ABCG2-expressing CWR-R1 cells. In addition, Ko143-treated mice had more differentiated tumors as evidenced by an increased percentage of CK8+/AR+ luminal cells and decreased percentage of ABCG2-expressing cells. Thus, inhibiting ABCG2-mediated androgen efflux forces the PSCs to undergo an AR-modulated differentiation to an ADT-sensitive luminal phenotype.  Implications:   This study identifies the mechanism by which the prostate stem cell marker, ABCG2, plays a role in prostate stem cell maintenance and provides a rationale for targeting ABCG2 for differentiation therapy in prostate cancer.

This new trend in medical research has been termed ""predictive medicine."" Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem and an ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second, tumor growth can be estimated by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use diffusion-reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to fingered growth. Results of our computations indicate that such shift is a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival and further development. We have also used our model to perform tissue-scale, personalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical practice.""","""['Guillermo Lorenzo', 'Michael A Scott', 'Kevin Tew', 'Thomas J R Hughes', 'Yongjie Jessica Zhang', 'Lei Liu', 'Guillermo Vilanova', 'Hector Gomez']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Prostate cancer: Do the maths - modelling tumour growth.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

We characterized recent trends and risk factors for prostate needle biopsy complications using a statewide, all-payer cohort.  Materials and methods:   We used SPARCS (New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System) to identify prostate needle biopsies performed between 2011 and 2014 via the transrectal and the transperineal approach (9,472 and 421 patients, respectively). We characterized trends in utilization and complications using Poisson regression and the Cochrane-Armitage test. We applied logistic regression to examine predictors of complications within 30 days of prostate needle biopsy.  Results:   Ambulatory use of prostate needle biopsy decreased with time (p <0.01). The most common indication for prostate needle biopsy was elevated prostate specific antigen in 53.2% of patients, followed by active surveillance for cancer in 26.7%, abnormal digital rectal examination in 2.6% and atypia in 1.6%. The prostate needle biopsy associated infection rate increased from 2.6% to 3.5% during the study period (p = 0.02). Among the 777 repeat prostate needle biopsies, the complication rate was comparable to that of initial prostate needle biopsy. Preprocedural rectal swab was done in less than 1% of prostate needle biopsies. On multivariable analysis, patient race, procedure year, diabetes (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.29-2.86, p <0.01), transrectal approach (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.27-9.54, p = 0.02) and recent hospitalization (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.43-2.89, p <0.01) were significantly associated with infection. The median total charge for infectious complications was $4,129 (IQR 711-19,185).

However, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) development and its prognostic significance in PCa is unknown.  Methods:   The mRNA and protein levels of PRKDC were analyzed in 15 pairs of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues as well as PCa cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of PRKDC, followed by cell proliferation, colony formation, and soft agar assays were performed. Xenograft mouse model was used to evaluate in vivo effects of PRKDC knockdown. The association between PRKDC expression and clinicopathologic features was assessed by χ2 tests. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to investigate the association between PRKDC expression and overall survival. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the prognostic significance of PRKDC.  Results:   Expression of PRKDC mRNA and protein was notably higher in PCa tissues and PCa cell lines. Knockdown of PRKDC markedly reduced cell proliferation, colony formation efficiency, and soft agar growth in DU145 cells. Down-regulation of PRKDC inhibited tumor growth of DU145 xenografts and enhance mice survival. In addition, PRKDC expression in PCa was significantly associated with Gleason score (P = 0.01), tumor stage (P = 0.028), and distant metastasis (P = 0.025). Patients with PCa having higher PRKDC expression had substantially shorter survival than patients with lower PRKDC expression.

For those institutions using several treatment modalities, 56 (66.67%) follow a therapeutic algorithm, while 28 (33.33%) follow no set order of treatment. However, among the 56 institutions with a set algorithm, 33 different approaches were identified. Of 84 institutions, 29 (34.52%) perform open reanastomosis in case of recurrent BNC, the remaining 55 (65.48%) do not.  Conclusion:   Despite several published guidelines on urethral strictures, numerous self-employed treatment algorithms are used to treat BNC. Although treatment results of these algorithms and the underlying treatment modalities cannot be determined with this work, it highlights the necessity for further studies comparing the different surgeries to allow for a more evidence-based approach.""","""['Daniel Pfalzgraf', 'Fabian P Siegel', 'Maximilian C Kriegmair', 'Nina Wagener']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Anastomotic strictures following radical prostatectomy: risk factors and management.', 'Anastomotic stricture after radical prostatectomy.

The causes of death can be misattributed, particularly in elderly men with multiple comorbidities, and therefore accurate assessment of the underlying cause of death is crucial for valid results. To address potential unreliability of end-point assessment, and its possible impact on mortality results, we analysed the study outcome adjudication data in six countries.  Methods:   Latent class statistical models were formulated to compare the accuracy of individual adjudicators, and to assess whether accuracy differed between the trial arms. We used the model to assess whether correcting for adjudication inaccuracies might modify the study results.  Results:   There was some heterogeneity in adjudication accuracy of causes of death, but no consistent differential accuracy by trial arm. Correcting the estimated screening effect for misclassification did not alter the estimated mortality effect of screening.  Conclusions:   Our findings were consistent with earlier reports on the European screening trial. Observer variation, while demonstrably present, is unlikely to have materially biased the main study results.

MAO inhibitors are considered useful for the treatment of depression and Parkinson's disease, and have recently attracted attention as potential therapeutic agents for a range of disorders including Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer and certain cardiomyopathies. This study shows that the 3-benzyloxy-β-nitrostyrene analogues are potent inhibitors of the MAO-B isoform with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (39-565 nM). Significantly, effectiveness towards MAO-B inhibition seems to be governed by the introduction of a 4″-fluoro-substituent on the benzyloxy ring, with compound 2b exhibiting the highest degree of MAO-B inhibition potency (IC50 = 0.039 μM) and selectivity (SI = 166) among the compounds investigated. Since some of the 3-benzyloxy-β-nitrostyrene analogues possess potencies that are comparable to that of the reversible inhibitor, safinamide (IC50 = 0.080 μM), it may be concluded that this class may be promising leads for the development of reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitors, that may be useful for the management of Parkinson's disease.""","""['Mietha M Van der Walt', ""Gisella Terre'Blanche"", 'Jacobus P Petzer', 'Anél Petzer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Inhibition of monoamine oxidase by benzoxathiolone analogues.', 'The adenosine receptor affinities and monoamine oxidase B inhibitory properties of sulfanylphthalimide analogues.', 'Inhibition of monoamine oxidase by 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone derivatives.', 'Therapeutic, Molecular and Computational Aspects of Novel Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors.', 'Structural Exploration of Synthetic Chromones as Selective MAO-B Inhibitors: A Mini Review.', 'Navigating into the Chemical Space of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors by Artificial Intelligence and Cheminformatics Approach.']"""

Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (MPC2) play a bottleneck role by transporting pyruvate into mitochondrial through the mitochondrial inner membrane. Therefore, their protein expression in cancers may be of clinical consequences. There are studies showing low levels of MPC1 expression in colon, kidney and lung cancers, and the expression of MPC1 correlates with poor prognosis. However, the expression status of MPC1 and MPC2 in prostate cancer (PCA) is unclear.  Methods:   In this study, expression of MPC1 and MPC2 in LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines was examined by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blotting. Compared to the LNCaP cells, lower levels of MPC1 and MPC2 expression in the DU145 cell line was identified. We then extended our study to 88 patients with prostate cancer who underwent transurethral electro-vaporization of prostate or radical prostatectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan, China. Patient-derived paraffin embedded PCA specimens were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlations with clinicopathologic factors were evaluated by Chi-square or Fisher´s exact probability tests. Overall survival (OS) rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to identify factors significantly correlated with prognosis.  Results:   Linear regression analysis revealed that MPC1 expression level was positively correlated with MPC2 expression (r = 0.375, P = 0.006) in the prostate cancers. MPC1 expression was negatively associated with UICC stage (P = 0.031). While UICC stage (P < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with MPC2 expression. Positive MPC1 or MPC2 expression in cancer tissues was significantly associated with higher OS (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that both MPC1 and MPC2 expressions in PCA were independent prognostic factors for higher OS (For MPC1: RR = 0.654, 95% CI: 0.621-0690, P < 0.001; For MPC2: RR = 0.696, 95% CI: 0.660-0.734, P < 0.001).

Main outcome measures:   Age-adjusted incidence rates; rate ratios comparing incidence in NT Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations with that for other Australians; 5-year survival; multivariable Poisson regression of excess mortality.  Results:   The incidence of most cancers in the NT non-Indigenous population was similar to that for other Australians. For the NT Indigenous population, the incidence of cancer at several sites was much higher (v other Australians: lung, 84% higher; head and neck, 325% higher; liver, 366% higher; cervix, 120% higher). With the exception of cervical cancer (65% decrease), incidence rates in the Indigenous population did not fall between 1991-1996 and 2007-2012. The incidence of several other cancers (breast, bowel, prostate, melanoma) was much lower in 1991-1996 than for other Australians, but had increased markedly by 2007-2012 (breast, 274% increase; bowel, 120% increase; prostate, 116% increase). Five-year survival was lower for NT Indigenous than for NT non-Indigenous patients, but had increased for both populations between 1991-2000 and 2001-2010.  Conclusion:   The incidence of several cancers that were formerly less common in NT Indigenous people has increased, without a concomitant reduction in the incidence of higher incidence cancers (several of which are smoking-related).

However, mice expressing an androgen-responsive promoter driven SENP1-transgene (SENP1-Tg) develop high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, but not carcinoma. We now show that tumor suppressive PTEN signaling is induced in SENP1-Tg to enhance prostate epithelial cell apoptosis. SENP1 blocks SUMO1-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of PTEN. In the absence of SENP1, SUMO1-modified PTEN is sequestered in the cytosol, where binding to ubiquitin-E3 ligase WWP2 occurs. Concurrently, WWP2 is also SUMOylated, which potentiates its interaction with PTEN. Thus, SENP1 directs ubiquitin-E3-substrate association to control PTEN stability. PTEN serves as a barrier for SENP1-mediated prostate carcinogenesis as SENP1-Tg mice develop invasive carcinomas only after PTEN reduction. Hence, SENP1 modulates multiple facets of carcinogenesis and may serve as a target specifically for aggressive PTEN-deficient PCa.""","""['Tasneem Bawa-Khalfe', 'Feng-Ming Yang', 'Joan Ritho', 'Hui-Kuan Lin', 'Jinke Cheng', 'Edward T H Yeh']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'Sumoylation Negatively Regulates CSR1-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cell Death.', 'SENP1 induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia through multiple mechanisms.', 'Role of desumoylation in the development of prostate cancer.', 'Recent research and development of inhibitors targeting sentrin-specific protease 1 for the treatment of cancers.', '5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through inhibiting of Mcl-1 expression.', ""Nuclear PTEN's Functions in Suppressing Tumorigenesis: Implications for Rare Cancers."", 'SENP1 Protects Against Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction Via Inhibiting STAT3 Signaling.', 'SENP1 Aberrance and Its Linkage to Clinical Features, Adjuvant Regimen, and Prognosis in Patients With Surgical Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy.', 'When PIP2 Meets p53: Nuclear Phosphoinositide Signaling in the DNA Damage Response.']"""

Assessment of genomic instability in bulk tumor or biopsy can be complicated due to sample availability, surrounding tissue contamination, or tumor heterogeneity. The Epic Sciences circulating tumor cell (CTC) platform utilizes a non-enrichment based approach for the detection and characterization of rare tumor cells in clinical blood samples. Genomic profiling of individual CTCs could provide a portrait of cancer heterogeneity, identify clonal and sub-clonal drivers, and monitor disease progression. To that end, we developed a single cell Copy Number Variation (CNV) Assay to evaluate genomic instability and CNVs in patient CTCs. For proof of concept, prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC3 and VCaP, were spiked into healthy donor blood to create mock patient-like samples for downstream single cell genomic analysis. In addition, samples from seven metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were included to evaluate clinical feasibility. CTCs were enumerated and characterized using the Epic Sciences CTC Platform. Identified single CTCs were recovered, whole genome amplified, and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500. CTCs were then analyzed for genome-wide copy number variations, followed by genomic instability analyses. Large-scale state transitions (LSTs) were measured as surrogates of genomic instability. Genomic instability scores were determined reproducibly for LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP, and were higher than white blood cell (WBC) controls from healthy donors. A wide range of LST scores were observed within and among the seven mCRPC patient samples. On the gene level, loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor was observed in PC3 and 5/7 (71%) patients. Amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was observed in VCaP cells and 5/7 (71%) mCRPC patients.

Background:   Preoperative radiotherapy (RT) enhances local control and cancer-specific survival in patients treated for rectal cancer. In case series, a negative acute effect on Leydig cell function has been reported.  Methods:   This prospective cohort study included 168 males with rectal or prostate cancer stage I-III. Males treated with preoperative RT and surgery for rectal cancer formed the exposed group (n = 93). Males treated with surgery alone were assigned to the unexposed group (n = 75). The androgen levels were assessed at baseline and after preoperative RT. The exposure was quantified with the treatment planning system to estimate the cumulative testicular dose (TD). The risk of low T (serum T < below 8 nmol/L) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were serum testosterone (T), bioavailable T, luteinizing hormone (LH), and the LH-T ratio.  Results:   The baseline levels of androgens were not related to exposure status or type of cancer. The proportion of low T increased from 14.6% at baseline to 35.4% after RT, relative risk 2.41 (95% CI 1.57 to 3.71, P < 0.001). Preoperative RT resulted in a significant decrease of serum and bioavailable T and a significant increase of LH and LH-T ratio. The decline in serum and bioavailable T was related to the TD.  Conclusions:   Preoperative RT for rectal cancer results in dose-dependent primary testicular failure increasing the risk of hypogonadism at the time of surgery by 2.4 times (number needed to harm = 5).""","""['Christian Buchli', 'Anna Martling', 'Massoud Al Abani', 'Jan-Erik Frödin', 'Matteo Bottai', 'Ingmar Lax', 'Stefan Arver', 'Torbjörn Holm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Surg""","""['Acute primary testicular failure due to radiotherapy increases risk of severe postoperative adverse events in rectal cancer patients.', 'Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy: A Risk Factor for Short-Term Wound Complications after Radical Resection for Rectal Cancer?', 'Relationship between of short-course preoperative radiotherapy and serum albumin level and postoperative complications in rectal cancer surgery.', 'Determining the optimal radiation-surgery interval (RSI) for oncologic proctectomy following radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma.', 'Testicular function after radiotherapy for rectal cancer--a review.', 'Acute primary testicular failure due to radiotherapy increases risk of severe postoperative adverse events in rectal cancer patients.', 'Effect of radiotherapy for rectal cancer on ovarian androgen production.']"""

Although it is very effective at the beginning, resistance appears after 2-3 years of treatment. Mutation of androgen receptor (AR) is considered a main reason for drug resistance. It is reported that AR W741C, W741L, W741C_T877A, T877A, F876L, F876L_T877A and L701H mutations can convert R-bicalutamide from AR antagonist to agonist, but the switching mechanisms are not clear. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were performed to analyze the interaction mechanisms between R-bicalutamide and wild type/mutant ARs. The results indicate that helix H12, which lies on the top of AR LBD like a cover, plays a vital role in R-bicalutamide binding. When interacting with AR, the B-ring of R-bicalutamide pushes H12 aside, distorting the coactivator binding site (AF2) resulting in the inactivation of transcription. Several residue mutations appear to enlarge the distance between the B-ring of R-bicalutamide and H12, reducing steric clash, which is conducive to a closed H12 conformation, leading to the formation of the coactivator binding site AF2 and increased transcription. Hydrogen bond and per-residue free energy decomposition analyses are also investigated to explore the interacting mechanisms, and M895 is found to be a key residue in the antagonist mechanism.

The longer half-life of fluorine-18 offers significant advantages over Ga-68, clinically and logistically. We aimed to develop high-affinity PSMA inhibitors labeled with fluorine-18 as alternative tracers for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Six triazolylphenyl ureas and their alkyne precursors were synthesized from the Glu-urea-Lys PSMA binding moiety. PSMA affinity was determined in a competitive binding assay using LNCaP cells. The [18F]triazoles were isolated following a Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction between the alkynes and [18F]fluoroethylazide. The 18F-labeled compounds were evaluated in nude mice bearing LNCaP tumors and compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and [18F]DCFPyL. Biodistribution studies of the two tracers with the highest imaged-derived tumor uptake and highest PSMA affinity were undertaken at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h post-injection (p.i.), and co-administration of PMPA was used to determine whether uptake was PSMA-specific.  Results:   F-18-labeled triazolylphenyl ureas were prepared with a decay-corrected RCY of 20-40 %, >98 % radiochemical and chemical purity, and specific activity of up to 391 GBq/μmol. PSMA binding (IC50) ranged from 3-36 nM. The position of the triazole influenced tumor uptake (3 > 4 > 2), and direct conjugation of the triazole with the phenylurea moiety was preferred to insertion of a spacer group. Image-derived tumor uptake ranged from 6-14 %ID/g at 2 h p.i., the time of maximum tumor uptake; uptake of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and [18F]DCFPyL was 5-6 %ID/g at 1-3 h p.i., the time of maximum tumor uptake. Biodistribution studies of the two most promising compounds gave maximum tumor uptakes of 10.9 ± 1.0 % and 14.3 ± 2.5 %ID/g, respectively, as compared to 6.27 ± 1.44 %ID/g for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC.  Conclusions:   Six [18F]triazolylphenyl ureas were prepared in good radiochemical yield. Compounds showed PSMA-specific uptake in LNCaP tumors as high as 14 % ID/g, more than a 2-fold increase over [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC.

Materials and methods:   Of 23,918 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 1984 and 2014, 10,236 with biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or 7 without upgrading were included in analysis. The cohort was divided into 3 groups, including group 1-biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason score 6 in 6,923 patients (67.6%), group 2-Gleason score 7 downgraded to radical prostatectomy Gleason score 6 in 648 (6.3%) and group 3-biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason score 7 in 2,665 (26.0%). Biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality risks were compared using Cox regression and competing risk analyses adjusting for clinicopathological variables.  Results:   At a median followup of 5 years (range 1 to 29), 992 men experienced biochemical recurrence and 95 had died of prostate cancer. Biochemical recurrence-free survival in downgraded cases (group 2) was better than in group 3 cases, which had Gleason score 7 on biopsy and radical prostatectomy (p <0.001), but worse than group 1 cases, which had Gleason score 6 on biopsy and radical prostatectomy (p <0.001). Downgrading was independently associated with biochemical recurrence (adjusted HR 1.87, p <0.0001) but not with prostate cancer specific mortality (adjusted HR 1.65, p = 0.636).

The effect of LH and testosterone reduction prior to and after switching therapy was comparable between the two groups, and increased PSA level after 3 months of treatment was seen in both groups (median PSA: 15.7-67.7 ng/mL in the LA to GA group; 15.2-71.4 ng/mL in the GA to LA group).

Recently, the PET tracers [11C]methionine and [18F]fluorocholine, among others, were developed in this cooperation, both of them tracers with high importance for oncologic positron emission tomography diagnostics. [11C]methionine, labeled by carbon-11 with a half-life of 20 min, is a proteosynthesis marker used primarily for brain tumor visualization, whereas [18F]fluorocholine, labeled by fluorine-18 with a half-life of 109 min, is a marker of synthesis of cellular membranes and cell proliferation, its primary use being PET diagnostics of prostate carcinoma.  Aim:   The results of clinical evaluations of both PET radiopharmaceuticals, performed on the basis of parameters agreed and approved beforehand in cooperation of MMCI, RECAMO and the manufacturer of said radiopharmaceuticals, aimed to prove the efficiency and suitability of both compounds for oncologic PET diagnostics for said tumors. In both cases, the radiopharmaceuticals were evaluated in regard to their major use.  Conclusion:   The obtained results prove the benefits and efficiency of both compounds in PET diagnostics of respective tumors. The results, in the form of clinical evaluation reports, will be used as part of the documentation required for marketing authorization of these compounds for use in the Czech Republic.Key words: positron emission tomography - radiopharmaceuticals - L-methyl-11C-methionine - 18F-fluorocholineThis work was supported by the project MEYS - NPS I - LO1413.The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical papers.Submitted: 10. 6. 2016Accepted: 17. 6. 2016.""","""['J Adam', 'R Demlová', 'Z Řehák']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['Development and use of non-FDG PET radiopharmaceuticals at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute.', 'New radiopharmaceuticals and positron-emission tomography applications at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute in Brno.', 'Acetylsalicylic Acid and its Potential for Chemoprevention of Colorectal Carcinoma.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy - Current Indications.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Three Novel Fluorine-18 Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals for P-Glycoprotein PET Imaging at the Blood-Brain Barrier.']"""

This model uses the high accuracy provided by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of log files and allows the experimental feedback from the high spatial resolution of films hosted in QuAArC. This cylindrical phantom was specifically designed to host films rolled at different radial distances able to take into account the entrance fluence and the 3D dose distribution. Ionization chamber measurements are also included in the feedback process for absolute dose considerations. In this way, automated MC simulation of treatment log files is implemented to calculate the actual delivery geometries, while the monitor units are experimentally adjusted to reconstruct the dose-volume histogram (DVH) on the patient CT. Prostate and head and neck clinical cases, previously planned with Monaco and Pinnacle treatment planning systems and verified with two different commercial systems (Delta4 and COMPASS), were selected in order to test operational feasibility of the proposed model. The proper operation of the feedback procedure was proved through the achieved high agreement between reconstructed dose distributions and the film measurements (global gamma passing rates > 90% for the 2%/2 mm criteria). The necessary discretization level of the log file for dose calculation and the potential mismatching between calculated control points and detection grid in the verification process were discussed. Besides the effect of dose calculation accuracy of the analytic algorithm implemented in treatment planning systems for a dynamic technique, it was discussed the importance of the detection density level and its location in VMAT specific phantom to obtain a more reliable DVH in the patient CT. The proposed model also showed enough robustness and efficiency to be considered as a pre-treatment VMAT verification system.""","""['A R Barbeiro', 'A Ureba', 'J A Baeza', 'R Linares', 'M Perucha', 'E Jiménez-Ortega', 'S Velázquez', 'J C Mateos', 'A Leal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: 3D VMAT Verification Based on Monte Carlo Log File Simulation with Experimental Feedback from Film Dosimetry.', 'Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'An in vivo dose verification method for SBRT-VMAT delivery using the EPID.', 'A Monte Carlo tool for evaluating VMAT and DIMRT treatment deliveries including planar detectors.', 'Correlation of phantom-based and log file patient-specific QA with complexity scores for VMAT.', 'Moving GPU-OpenCL-based Monte Carlo dose calculation toward clinical use: Automatic beam commissioning and source sampling for treatment plan dose calculation.', 'Absorbed dose calculation for a realistic CT-derived mouse phantom irradiated with a standard Cs-137 cell irradiator using a Monte Carlo method.', 'Comparison of pre-treatment and in-vivo dosimetry for advanced radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'Methodology for radiochromic film analysis using FilmQA Pro and ImageJ.', 'Accurate, robust and harmonized implementation of morpho-functional imaging in treatment planning for personalized radiotherapy.']"""

We sought to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) reduces distress in men with advanced PC. Methods Men with advanced PC (proven metastatic and/or castration-resistant biochemical progression) were randomly assigned to an 8-week, group-based MBCT intervention delivered by telephone (n = 94) or to minimally enhanced usual care (n = 95). Primary intervention outcomes were psychological distress, cancer-specific distress, and prostate-specific antigen anxiety. Mindfulness skills were assessed as potential mediators of effect. Participants were assessed at baseline and were followed up at 3, 6, and 9 months. Main statistical analyses were conducted on the basis of intention to treat. Results Fourteen MBCT groups were conducted in the intervention arm. Facilitator adherence ratings were high (> 93%). Using random-effects mixed-regression models, intention-to-treat analyses indicated no significant changes in intervention outcomes or in engagement with mindfulness for men in MBCT compared with those receiving minimally enhanced usual care. Per-protocol analyses also found no differences between arms in outcomes or engagement, with the exception of the mindfulness skill of observing, which increased over time for men in MBCT compared with usual care ( P = .032). Conclusion MBCT in this format was not more effective than minimally enhanced usual care in reducing distress in men with advanced PC.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of ADT is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, in patients with prostate cancer. Patients and Methods Using the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we assembled a cohort of 30,903 men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between April 1, 1988 and April 30, 2015, and observed them until April 30, 2016. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs of dementia associated with the use of ADT compared with nonuse. ADT exposure was lagged by 1 year to account for delays associated with the diagnosis of dementia and to minimize reverse causality. Secondary analyses assessed whether the risk varied with cumulative duration of use and by ADT type. Results During a mean (standard deviation) follow-up of 4.3 (3.6) years, 799 patients were newly diagnosed with dementia (incidence, 6.0; 95% CI, 5.6 to 6.4) per 1,000 person-years. Compared with nonuse, ADT use was not associated with an increased risk of dementia (incidence, 7.4 v 4.4 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.19). In secondary analyses, cumulative duration of use ( P for heterogeneity = .78) and no single type of ADT were associated with an increased risk of dementia. Conclusion In this population-based study, the use of ADT was not associated with an increased risk of dementia. Additional studies in different settings are needed to confirm these findings.""","""['Farzin Khosrow-Khavar', 'Soham Rej', 'Hui Yin', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Laurent Azoulay']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer and the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer and the Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', ""Risk of Alzheimer's Disease Among Senior Medicare Beneficiaries Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer."", 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and dementia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy, dementia, and cognitive dysfunction in men with prostate cancer: How much smoke and how much fire?', 'Association of Second-generation Antiandrogens With Cognitive and Functional Toxic Effects in Randomized Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A Systematic Review on the Potential Acceleration of Neurocognitive Aging in Older Cancer Survivors.', 'Characteristics and general practice resource use of people with comorbid cancer and dementia in England: a retrospective cross-sectional study.', ""Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease."", 'The Insignificant Correlation between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Incidence of Dementia Using an Extension Survival Cox Hazard Model and Propensity-Score Matching Analysis in a Retrospective, Population-Based Prostate Cancer Registry.']"""

Methods:   First of all, we conducted a literature search and survey of all oncological rehabilitation centers in Germany (N = 145) to obtain a thorough perspective of the recent evidence, guidelines, the structural framework, and practice of psychological services in oncological rehabilitation. Next, an expert workshop was held with national experts from scientific departments, clinicians from rehabilitation centers, and patients. In this workshop, we drafted and agreed upon an initial version of the practice guidelines. Afterwards, the practice guidelines were sent to all head physicians and senior psychologists at oncological rehabilitation centers in Germany for approval (N = 280 questionnaires). In addition, key recommendations were discussed with a group of rehabilitation patients. Finally, the practice guidelines were revised by the expert panel and made available online to the public.  Results:   The practice guidelines have been widely accepted by both the expert panel and the surveyed clinicians and patients. They include recommendations for psycho-oncological interventions that should be offered to all rehabilitation patients with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. They also comprise recommendations for specific problem areas concerning psychological functions, body functions, and environmental and personal factors.

This necessitates uptake of L-Cys that is predominantly in its disulfide form, L-cystine (CSSC), via the xCT(-) transporter.

Treatment with this enzyme selectively causes cell cycle arrest and death in cancer cells due to depletion of intracellular GSH and ensuing elevated ROS; yet this treatment results in no apparent toxicities in mice even after months of continuous treatment. Cyst(e)inase suppressed the growth of prostate carcinoma allografts, reduced tumor growth in both prostate and breast cancer xenografts and doubled the median survival time of TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice, which develop disease resembling human chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

However, the mechanisms by which EZH2 is regulated in PCa and CRPC remain elusive. Here we report that EZH2 is post-transcriptionally regulated by SKP2 in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in mouse models. We observed aberrant upregulation of Skp2, Ezh2 and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in both Pten null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Pten null mouse prostate tissues. Loss of Skp2 resulted in a striking decrease of Ezh2 levels in Pten/Trp53 double-null MEFs and in prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 double-null mutant mice. SKP2 knockdown decreased EZH2 levels in human PCa cells through upregulation of TRAF6-mediated and lysine(K) 63-linked ubiquitination of EZH2 for degradation. Ectopic expression of TRAF6 promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of EZH2 to decrease EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels in PCa cells. In contrast, TRAF6 knockdown resulted in a reduced EZH2 ubiquitination with an increase of EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels in PCa cells. Furthermore, the catalytically dead mutant TRAF6 C70A abolished the TRAF6-mediated polyubiquitination of recombinant human EZH2 in vitro. Most importantly, a concurrent elevation of Skp2 and Ezh2 was found in CRPC tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice, and expression levels of SKP2 and EZH2 were positively correlated in human PCa specimens. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel mechanism on EZH2 ubiquitination and an important signaling network of SKP2-TRAF6-EZH2/H3K27me3, and targeting SKP2-EZH2 pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRPC treatment.""","""['W Lu', 'S Liu', 'B Li', 'Y Xie', 'M G Izban', 'B R Ballard', 'S A Sathyanarayana', 'S E Adunyah', 'R J Matusik', 'Z Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['SKP2 inactivation suppresses prostate tumorigenesis by mediating JARID1B ubiquitination.', 'Skp2 regulates androgen receptor through ubiquitin-mediated degradation independent of Akt/mTOR pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Skp2: a novel potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'The Skp2 Pathway: A Critical Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'EZH2: An Accomplice of Gastric Cancer.', 'Multiomics characteristics and immunotherapeutic potential of EZH2 in pan-cancer.', 'Role of K63-linked ubiquitination in cancer.', 'IGF2BP1 Promotes Proliferation of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms by Post-Transcriptional Enhancement of EZH2.', 'Overexpression of miR-101 suppresses collagen synthesis by targeting EZH2 in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts.']"""

Methods: Prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells were treated with GSK126 at different doses. Cell growth was detected by sulforhodamine assay. Cell apoptosis was assayed by Annexin V-/PI kit. Transwell chamber and wound healing assays were conducted to detect cell migration. The mRNA level was detected by quantitative PCR, and protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Results: GSK126 showed significant effect on cell growth and apoptosis when the dose was higher than 50 μmol/L. Wound healing assay revealed that scratch space in PC-3 cells was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in GSK126-treated groups[(247.2±24.4),(347.2±19.2) and (410.5±18.1) μm in low, medium and high dose (5.0, 20.0, 50.0 μmol/L), respectively] as compared with the control group[(171.3±17.8) μm](all P<0.05). Transwell assay showed that migrated PC-3 cells in control group was 322.0±17.9,while those in GSK126-treated groups were 198.3±15.4 (low),82.7±6.2 (medium) and 30.2±4.1 (high), and the differences between the control group and GSK126-treated groups were significant(all P<0.05). In addition, GSK126 up-regulated E-cadherin mRNA expression and down-regulated N-cadherin and Vimentin mRNA expression, whereas had no significant effect on Snail, Fibronectin and VEGF-A mRNA expression.

We studied the association of mast cell count and densities with prostate cancer recurrence using tissue microarrays (TMAs) for 462 men who recurred (cases) and 462 controls that were matched to the cases nested in a cohort of radical prostatectomy patients.  Methods:   Dual-immunostaining for mast cell tryptase and epithelial cytokeratin-8 and whole slide image analysis were used to assess total mast cell number, mast cell density (mast cell number/tissue area), and mast cell number per epithelial or stromal area in TMA spots containing tumor (up to 4 per man). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of recurrence for the mean, minimum, and maximum mast cell parameters in tumor tissue among each man's TMA spots.  Results:   After taking into account matching factors of age, race, Gleason sum, and pathologic stage, higher minimum mast cell density in the tumor (comparing highest to lowest quartiles: OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.86; P-trend = 0.004) was associated with a lower risk of recurrence. Patterns for mast cell number and ratio of mast cell number to epithelial or stromal area were similar to those for mast cell density.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that intratumoral mast cells may be protective against prostate cancer recurrence and could potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker after prostatectomy.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of elderly prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1999-2011 by using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database. Competing risk analyses adjusting for patient characteristics were conducted to assess the impact of radiotherapy on the development of subsequent MDS/AML, compared with surgery.  Results:   Of 32,112 prostate cancer patients, 14,672 underwent radiotherapy, and 17,440 received surgery only. The median follow-up was 4.68 years. A total of 157 (0.47%) prostate cancer patients developed subsequent MDS or AML, and the median time to develop MDS/AML was 3.30 (range: 0.16-9.48) years. Compared with prostate cancer patients who received surgery only, patients who underwent radiotherapy had a significantly increased risk of developing MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR] =1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.13). When radiotherapy was further categorized by modalities (brachytherapy, conventional conformal radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]), increased risk of second MDS/AML was only observed in the IMRT group (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.09-2.54).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of MDS/AML, and the impact may differ by modality. Additional studies with longer follow-up are needed to further clarify the role of radiotherapy in the development of subsequent myeloid malignancies.

Methods:   The dose differences of clinical target volume for pelvic lymph node (CTVLN) due to isocenter (IC) shift and pelvic rotation were evaluated using the radiation treatment planning system. The rotated computed tomography (CT) images were created for the simulation of the pelvic rotation. The original CT images were rotated around the IC of the original plan in the pitch and roll directions up to±3.0 deg. at 1.0 deg. intervals. As simulated plans, IC positions were shifted in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions up to±10 mm at 2 mm intervals in the original and rotated CT images, and the dose distributions were calculated. The dose calculation was performed for each CT image while keeping the movement of multi leaf collimator and the monitor unit of the original plan.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo dosimetry for prostate cancer using VMAT.  Method:   VMAT plans were generated for eight patients with prostate cancer using treatment planning system (TPS), and patient quality assurances (QAs) were carried out with phantom. We analyzed five plans as phantom study and five plans as patient study. Projection images were acquired during VMAT delivery. DC converted acquired images into fluence images and used a pencil beam algorithm to calculate dose distributions delivered on the CT images of the phantom and the patients. We evaluated isocenter point doses and gamma analysis in both studies and dose indexes of planning target volume (PTV), bladder and rectum in patient study.  Results and discussion:   Dose differences at the isocenter were less than a criterion in both studies. Pass rates of the gamma analysis were less than a criterion by two plans in the phantom study. Dose indexes of reconstructed distribution were lower than original plans and standard deviations of PTV in reconstructed distribution were larger than original plans. The errors were caused by some issues, such as the commissioning of DC, variations in patient anatomy, and patient positioning.

Despite encouraging results, many cancer cells maintain resistance to oncolytic VSV mutants in part due to residual antiviral responses. We sought to determine whether combination of VSV with natural agents with anti-tumor properties, such as curcumin, resveratrol, and flavokavain B, would enhance tumor cell killing in a prostate cancer model. Our results revealed that pretreatment with curcumin potentiated VSV-induced oncolysis of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in cell culture and in a mouse model of prostate cancer. The ability of curcumin to synergize with VSV in PC-3 cells correlated with a cumulative decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xl, and in the phosphorylation of NF-κB. Although curcumin did not impact the expression of type I IFN in infected cells, it inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of STAT1, a key player in the IFN response pathway, leading to an overall increase in virus-infected cells.

Methods:   Using a prospectively populated database of 3084 men who underwent open radical prostatectomy, candidates for AS by strict (Johns Hopkins) and expanded (University of Toronto) criteria were identified. The presence of adverse pathologic features at radical prostatectomy was compared between those men with and without biopsy PNI.  Results:   Of 596 men who met strict criteria for AS, 16 (3%) had biopsy PNI. In the strict AS cohort, there were no differences in adverse pathologic features at radical prostatectomy between those with and without PNI. Of 1197 men who were candidates for AS by expanded criteria, 102 (9%) had biopsy PNI. Men with biopsy PNI in the expanded AS cohort were more likely to have extraprostatic extension (P < .001) and pathologic upgrading (P = .01) at prostatectomy. In addition, those with PNI had larger dominant nodules (P < .001), and cancer comprised a greater percentage of their prostate glands (P < .001).

Methods:   Patients underwent MRI-TRUS-targeted biopsy as part of an ongoing prospective trial from August 2007 to February 2015. For men with HUL, the biopsy pathology of HUL and MRI lesions was classified according to the updated 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system. The detection of PCa by MRI-targeted biopsy with and without HUL biopsy was compared.  Results:   Of 1260 men in the trial, 106 underwent biopsy of 119 HULs. PCa was diagnosed in 52 out of 106 men (49%) by biopsy of either MRI lesions or HUL. Biopsy of HUL in addition to MRI lesions resulted in 4 additional diagnoses of high-grade (ISUP grades 3-5) PCa versus biopsy of MRI lesions alone (20 vs 16 men, P = .046). Three of these cases were upgraded from lower grade (ISUP grades 1-2) PCa on MRI-guided biopsy alone, and only 1 case (1% of cohort) was diagnosed that would have been missed by MRI-guided biopsy alone. Supplemental biopsy of HUL did not change the PCa risk category in 96% (102 out of 106) of men with HUL.  Conclusion:   Supplemental biopsy of HUL yields a small increase in the detection of higher grade PCa as compared with biopsy of MRI lesions alone. As upgrading is rare, routinely screening for HUL during MRI-targeted biopsy remains controversial.""","""['Nabeel A Shakir', 'M Minhaj Siddiqui', 'Arvin K George', 'Michael Kongnyuy', 'Richard Ho', 'Michele Fascelli', 'Maria J Merino', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound-fusion biopsy significantly upgrades prostate cancer versus systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Ultrasonographic Findings on Cancer Detection Rate during Magnetic Resonance Image/Ultrasonography Fusion-Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'The role of multiparametric ultrasound in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Is targeted biopsy really needed when performing systematic prostate biopsy to raise the detection rate for prostate cancer in patients with prostate-specific antigen ≤10\u200ang/mL?', 'Aptamer-conjugated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a new targeted ultrasound contrast agent for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Risk factors for infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.']"""

In partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease.  Methods:   Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT2 trial, 526 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial. Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, lesion sites, and previous treatments. Data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interest-namely, overall survival. Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables (overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 33 could be used for independent validation. Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC). The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance. Further validation was done using data from a fifth trial-ENTHUSE M1-in which 266 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone.  Findings:   50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were evaluated through the DREAM challenge. The top performer was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function. Overall, ePCR outperformed all other methods (iAUC 0·791; Bayes factor >5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0·743; Bayes factor >20). Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (ePCR: hazard ratio 3·32, 95% CI 2·39-4·62, p<0·0001; reference model: 2·56, 1·85-3·53, p<0·0001). The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M1 cohort with similarly high performance (iAUC 0·768). Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker.  Interpretation:   Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of methods in the future. The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in advanced prostate cancer.

Despite its popularity, it suffers from systemic side effects and susceptibility to drug resistance. Curcumin (CURC), on the other hand, is a drug that recently gained popularity due to its wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Limitations to its clinical translation include its poor water solubility and the need for administration of high doses. Combinatory anti-cancer therapy has been proposed as a common approach to overcome one or more of these challenges. In this work, we propose a combinatory DOX and CURC anti-cancer therapy of prostate cancer cells in vitro. DOX and CURC were administered in the free drug and nanocapsule form, respectively. Cell size and complexity, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were studied by flow cytometry, MTT assay and sub-G1 quantification, respectively. Cellular uptake of CURC nanocapsules (CURC NCs) was quantified by fluorescence microscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection. Results showed that in vitro treatment with CURC NCs in the presence of subtherapeutic concentrations of DOX, led to significant increase in prostate cancer cells (PC3) apoptosis and death. This was likely due to significantly enhanced CURC uptake by the cells. The study presents a good rationale for pursuing combinatory CURC/DOX therapy in pre-clinical tumor animal models in the near future.""","""['Rebecca Klippstein', 'Sukhvinder S Bansal', 'Khuloud T Al-Jamal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of long-circulating liposomes co-encapsulating curcumin and doxorubicin on C26 murine colon cancer cells.', 'Amphiphilic curcumin conjugate-forming nanoparticles as anticancer prodrug and drug carriers: in vitro and in vivo effects.', 'Co-delivery of curcumin and doxorubicin in PEGylated liposomes favored the antineoplastic C26 murine colon carcinoma microenvironment.', 'Improved pharmacokinetics and reduced side effects of doxorubicin therapy by liposomal co-encapsulation with curcumin.', 'A new polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticle system increases cytotoxicity of doxorubicin against multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cells.', 'Antineoplastic Effects of Mucuna pruriens Against Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Polychemotherapy with Curcumin and Doxorubicin via Biological Nanoplatforms: Enhancing Antitumor Activity.', 'Naturally occurring anti-cancer compounds: shining from Chinese herbal medicine.', 'Combined effects of curcumin and doxorubicin on cell death and cell migration of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.', 'Proscillaridin A induces apoptosis, inhibits STAT3 activation and augments doxorubicin toxicity in prostate cancer cells.']"""

This study investigated the effect of steric stabilisation, varying liposome composition, and lipid:drug molar ratio on drug loading and on the physicochemical properties of the DTX-loaded liposomes. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to remove free DTX from the liposomal formulation, and its impact on drug loading and in vitro cytotoxicity was also evaluated. Liposomes composed of fluid, unsaturated lipid (DOPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000) showed the highest DTX loading compared to rigid, saturated lipids (DPPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000 and DSPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000). The inclusion of PEG showed a minimum effect on DTX encapsulation. Decreasing lipid:drug molar ratio from 40:1 to 5:1 led to an improvement in the loading capacities of DOPC-based liposomes only. Up to 3.6-fold decrease in drug loading was observed after liposome purification, likely due to the loss of adsorbed and loosely entrapped DTX in the SEC column. Our in vitro toxicity results in PC3 monolayer showed that non-purified, DTX-loaded DOPC:Chol liposomes were initially (24h) more potent than the purified ones, due to the fast action of the surface- adsorbed drug. However, we hypothesize that over time (48 and 72h) the purified, DTX-loaded DOPC:Chol liposomes became more toxic due to high intracellular release of encapsulated DTX. Finally, our cytotoxicity results in PC3 spheroids showed the superior activity of DTX-loaded liposomes compared to free DTX, which could overcome the DTX poor tissue penetration, drug resistance, and improve its therapeutic efficacy following systemic administration.""","""['Sara Pereira', 'Raphael Egbu', 'Gemma Jannati', ""Wafa' T Al-Jamal""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['A simple passive equilibration method for loading carboplatin into pre-formed liposomes incubated with ethanol as a temperature dependent permeability enhancer.', 'Effects of lipid composition and preparation conditions on physical-chemical properties, technological parameters and in vitro biological activity of gemcitabine-loaded liposomes.', 'Optimization of Docetaxel Loading Conditions in Liposomes: proposing potential products for metastatic breast carcinoma chemotherapy.', 'Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a new generation therapeutic delivery platform: a review.', 'Current development in nanoformulations of docetaxel.', 'Strategies for Solubility and Bioavailability Enhancement and Toxicity Reduction of Norcantharidin.', 'Optimization and Characterization of a Liposomal Azithromycin Formulation for Alternative Macrophage Activation.', 'Transfersome Hydrogel Containing 5-Fluorouracil and Etodolac Combination for Synergistic Oral Cancer Treatment.', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Conjugated Disulfide Cross-Linked Alginate Nanoparticles as a Docetaxel Carrier for Colon Cancer Therapy.', 'Advances in Nanocarriers for Effective Delivery of Docetaxel in the Treatment of Lung Cancer: An Overview.']"""

Overtreatment imposes a substantial economic burden on health care systems. We compared the direct medical costs of conservative management and radical therapy for the management of early-stage prostate cancer in routine care.  Methods:   An observational study design is chosen based on claims data of a German statutory health insurance fund for the years 2008-2011. Three hundred fifty-three age-matched men diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated with conservative management and radical prostatectomy, are included. Individuals with diagnoses of metastases or treatment of advanced prostate cancer are excluded. In an excess cost approach direct medical costs are considered from an insured community perspective for in- and outpatient care, pharmaceuticals, physiotherapy, and assistive technologies. Generalized linear models adjust for comorbidity by Charlson comorbidity score and recycled predictions method calculates per capita costs per treatment strategy.  Results:   After follow-up of 2.5 years per capita costs of conservative management are €6611 lower than costs of prostatectomy ([-9734;-3547], p < 0.0001). Complications increase costs of assistive technologies by 30% (p = 0.0182), but do not influence any other costs. Results are robust to cost outliers and incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis. The short time horizon does not allow assessing long-term consequences of conservative management.  Conclusions:   At a time horizon of 2.5 years, conservative management is preferable to radical prostatectomy in terms of costs.

Although early stage breast cancer can be effectively treated, there are limited numbers of treatment options available for patients with advanced and metastatic disease. The novel breast cancer associated antigen NY-BR-1 was identified by SEREX analysis and is expressed in the majority (>70%) of breast tumors as well as metastases, in normal breast tissue, in testis and occasionally in prostate tissue. The biological function and regulation of NY-BR-1 is up to date unknown.  Methods:   We performed an in silico analysis on the genetic variations of the NY-BR-1 gene using data available in public SNP databases and the tools SIFT, Polyphen and Provean to find possible functional SNPs. Additionally, we considered the allele frequency of the found damaging SNPs and also analyzed data from an in-house sequencing project of 55 breast cancer samples for recurring SNPs, recorded in dbSNP.  Results:   Over 2800 SNPs are recorded in the dbSNP and NHLBI ESP databases for the NY-BR-1 gene. Of these, 65 (2.07%) are synonymous SNPs, 191 (6.09%) are non-synoymous SNPs, and 2430 (77.48%) are noncoding intronic SNPs. As a result, 69 non-synoymous SNPs were predicted to be damaging by at least two, and 16 SNPs were predicted as damaging by all three of the used tools. The SNPs rs200639888, rs367841401 and rs377750885 were categorized as highly damaging by all three tools. Eight damaging SNPs are located in the ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), a domain known for its frequent involvement in protein-protein interactions. No distinctive features could be observed in the allele frequency of the analyzed SNPs.  Conclusion:   Considering these results we expect to gain more insights into the variations of the NY-BR-1 gene and their possible impact on giving rise to splice variants and therefore influence the function of NY-BR-1 in healthy tissue as well as in breast cancer.""","""['Zeynep Kosaloglu', 'Julia Bitzer', 'Niels Halama', 'Zhiqin Huang', 'Marc Zapatka', 'Andreas Schneeweiss', 'Dirk Jäger', 'Inka Zörnig']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Identification of functional SNPs in BARD1 gene and in silico analysis of damaging SNPs: based on data procured from dbSNP database.', 'Identification of tumor-restricted antigens NY-BR-1, SCP-1, and a new cancer/testis-like antigen NW-BR-3 by serological screening of a testicular library with breast cancer serum.', 'Identification of a tissue-specific putative transcription factor in breast tissue by serological screening of a breast cancer library.', 'Distinct expression patterns of the immunogenic differentiation antigen NY-BR-1 in normal breast, testis and their malignant counterparts.', 'Computational prediction of the effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA repair genes.', 'Peptide-Based Vaccines in Clinical Phases and New Potential Therapeutic Targets as a New Approach for Breast Cancer: A Review.', 'Frequent Molecular Subtype Switching and Gene Expression Alterations in Lung and Pleural Metastasis From Luminal A-Type Breast Cancer.']"""

The aberrant glycosylation pattern of PSA may serve as a valuable tool for improving PCa diagnosis including its early-stage. In this study, we evaluated the usability of two techniques, surface plasmon resonance and protein microarray assay, for the study and characterization of interactions of PSA (both free and complexed) with six lectins (SNA, ConA, RCA, AAL, WGA and MAA II). The information on the character of such interactions is important for the application of lectins as prospective bioreceptors for biomarker glycoprofiling in a follow-up biosensing assays. SPR as well as established bioanalytical techniques allowed determination of KD values of PSA-lectin interactions in a more reliable way than protein microarray.

For all analyses, sample quality is unquestionably a critical factor; therefore protein extraction is of outmost importance. The ideal extraction method should provide reproducible spectra of the most comprehensive repertoire of proteins, while minimizing sample loss and degradation. It is already known that to capture the whole proteome is an unenforceable task. Many protein extraction protocols have been described, yet there is no ""one perfect procedure"" taking into account the vast diversity of biological and physical properties of proteins, including their charge, size, hydrophobicity, interactions and sub-cellular localization. The research presented here reflects the main obstacle occurring in proteomic experimental design; i.e. the lack of reproducibility as a result of alterations in protein extraction methods. We have performed a series of experiments, aimed towards identification of the aptamer-binding partners in cancerous cells. Aptamers are chemically synthesized, short, single-stranded nucleic acids with a strictly defined three-dimensional structure, which allows them to interact with a target molecule with high affinity. The low immunogenicity and cellular- targeting properties of aptamers might facilitate design of suitable drugs with low side-effects. Aptamers can be used for identification of molecules associated with a pathogenic state of a cell. Aptamers can be considered as a powerful tool, since they possess unique properties to benefit cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment. We have used different types of protein extraction methods prior to analyses of complex biological samples by mass spectrometry, based on slight changes of homogenization buffers, and have observed the changes in the identified compounds. These results should prove to be very useful for future proteomic studies and the design of studies in terms of sample preparation, especially sample homogenization and protein extraction.""","""['Anna Drabik', 'Joanna Ner-Kluza', 'Anna Bodzon-Kulakowska', 'Piotr Suder']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Mass Spectrom (Chichester)""","""['Reproducibility of serum protein profiling by systematic assessment using solid-phase extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Optimization of analytical and pre-analytical conditions for MALDI-TOF-MS human urine protein profiles.', 'A High-Efficiency Cellular Extraction System for Biological Proteomics.', 'Towards a standardization of the tools for the studies of clinical proteomics.', 'Aiming for zero blindness.']"""

Therefore, we investigated the impact of comorbidity on overall survival (OS) in PC patients treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost.  Material and methods:   At a single center, 611 consecutive patients diagnosed with localized PC from 1998 to 2004 underwent definitive EBRT (50 Gy) and HDR brachytherapy boosts (2 × 10 Gy) combined with neoadjuvant total androgen blockade. Comorbidity was assessed with the Charlson comorbidity score. The impact of risk factors on OS and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated using Cox proportional hazard ratios. Risk groups were defined as follows: low-risk PC: PSA <10, WHO grade 1 and T stage 1; high-risk PC: PSA >20 and/or WHO grade 3 and/or T stage 3a; intermediate-risk PC representing patients who did not fit either the low- or high-risk PC group.  Results:   Mean age in the study cohort was 66.4 years, and 51% of the patients reported some degree of comorbidity. Divided into risk groups 8.2% were categorized as low-risk, 64% as intermediate-risk and 27.8% as high-risk PC. Overall 10-year survival was 72.2%, and 89% of the patients were relapse-free. In the univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard ratios, age, comorbidity and T stage were statistically significant predictors of OS: hazard ratios 1.56, 1.44 and 1.2 (p-values .002, .04 and .05), respectively. WHO grade, PSA at diagnosis, T stage and comorbidity were also significant predictors of DFS (p-values .0001, .0001, .009 and .003, respectively).  Conclusion:   Comorbidity assessed with the Charlson score predicts OS in patients with localized PC treated with curative intent using combined EBRT and HDR brachytherapy boost, and should be considered when making decisions before radical treatment.""","""['Marie Hjälm-Eriksson', 'Anders Ullén', 'Hemming Johansson', 'Seymoure Levitt', 'Sten Nilsson', 'Karl-Mikael Kälkner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The effectiveness and side effects of conformal external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost compared to conformal external beam radiotherapy alone in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Clinical outcomes of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy in the management of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Five-year biochemical recurrence-free and overall survival following high-dose-rate brachytherapy with additional external beam or radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Irradiation of localized prostate cancer in the elderly: A systematic literature review.', 'Does brachytherapy boost improve survival outcomes in Gleason Grade Group 5 patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy?

Anxiety before diagnosis may relate to the comprehension of relevant health information or openness to potential treatments. This study examined anxiety and these outcomes in men who were waiting to learn of a prostate cancer diagnosis.  Objectives:   One goal of this study was to determine whether anxiety would increase as men came closer to learning the results of their prostate cancer biopsy. Another goal was to test whether anxiety was associated with knowledge about prostate cancer or openness to different treatments.  Methods:   Men (N = 265) who were facing a prostate cancer diagnosis were surveyed at two time points. Time 1 occurred at the time of biopsy, and Time 2 occurred immediately before men received their biopsy result. At each time point, men reported their anxiety about prostate cancer and their biopsy result. At Time 2, they completed a knowledge test of information about prostate cancer and reported their openness to different potential treatments.  Results:   Anxiety symptoms increased as men came closer to learning their diagnosis. Also, higher anxiety was associated with lower knowledge and greater openness to particular treatments like surgery. Interactions showed that when anxiety increased from Time 1 to Time 2, having high or low knowledge mattered less to treatment openness.  Conclusion:   Waiting for a cancer diagnosis is an important time period in which anxiety may increase and relate to information processing and openness to treatments. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Men undergoing prostate cancer screening have been found to experience high and low levels of anxiety. Research has shown that negative emotions like anxiety are common following a cancer diagnosis, but little research has examined emotions right before diagnosis. Anxiety has been associated with information processing and motivation to engage in preventive behaviours. What does this study add? Applies and tests a theoretical idea related to how anxiety may change as one approaches personally relevant threatening health feedback. Shows relationships between changes in anxiety and knowledge in the context of waiting for actual health feedback.

There is a need for simple but effective behaviour change interventions with the potential to be implemented within the cancer care pathway. Habit-based advice encourages repetition of a behaviour in a consistent context so that the behaviour becomes increasingly automatic in response to a specific contextual cue. This approach therefore encourages long-term behaviour change and can be delivered through printed materials. 'Healthy Habits for Life' is a brief intervention based on habit theory, and incorporating printed materials plus a personally tailored discussion, that has been designed specifically for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. The aim of this trial was to test the effect of 'Healthy Habits for Life' on a composite health behaviour risk index (CHBRI) over 3 months in patients with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer.  Method and analysis:   A 2-arm, individually randomised controlled trial in patients with breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Patients will be recruited over 18 months from 7 National Health Service Trusts in London and Essex. Following baseline assessments and allocation to intervention or usual care, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome will be change in CHBRI at 3 months. Maintenance of any changes over 6 months, and changes in individual health behaviours (including dietary intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking status) will also be explored.

Methods:   Patients received radical radiotherapy as either 33.5 Gy/5 fr for SBRT or 75.6 Gy/35 fr for VMAT. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Cancer Module (QLQ-PR25) forms were used to assess QOL.  Results:   Of the 48 patients (28 in SBRT and 20 in VMAT) included in the study, 40 (20 in SBRT and 20 in VMAT) were evaluated for QOL status.

Conventional chemotherapeutics such as Paclitaxel, a commonly used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, is not sufficient to overcome Bcl-2 mediated drug resistance mechanism. Thus, combinational drug regimes are favored by researchers to overcome resistance phenotype against drugs. N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSpm), a polyamine analogue, which is a promising drug candidate induced-cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer cells such as prostate, melanoma, colon and breast cancer cells via activated polyamine catabolism and reactive oxygen generation. Recent studies indicated the potential therapeutic role of DENSpm in phase I and II trials in breast cancer cases. Although the molecular targets of Paclitaxel in apoptotic cell death mechanism is well documented, the therapeutic effect of DENSpm and Paclitaxel in breast cancer cells has not been investigated yet. In this study, our aim was to determine the time dependent effect of DENSpm and Paclitaxel on apoptotic cell death via determination of polyamine metabolism related targets in wt and Bcl-2 overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells.  Results:   In our experimental study, Paclitaxel decreased cell viability in dose-dependent manner within 24h. Co-treatment of Paclitaxel (30nM) with DENSpm (20μM) further increased the cytoxicity of Paclitaxel (30nM) compared to alone Paclitaxel (30nM) treatment in MCF-7 Bcl-2+ breast cancer cells. In addition, we determined that resistance against Paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death in Bcl-2 overexpressed MCF-7 cells was overcome due to activation of polyamine catabolic pathway, which caused depletion of polyamines.

Statistical differences were evaluated using a paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of 0.05%.  Results:   A total of 150 plans were generated for this study. Acceptable PO plans were obtained using single arcs, while two arcs were necessary for PPLN. All plans were highly conformal (CI ≥1.3 and CN ≥0.90) with no significant differences in the PTV dose coverage. 6MV plans required significantly longer treatment time and had higher dose spillage compared to FFF plans. Superior plans were obtained using 10 F 300° partial arcs for PO with the lowest rectal dose, dose spillage and the shortest treatment times. For PPLN, 6 F and 10 F plans were equivalent.  Conclusions:   SABR-VMAT with FFF photon beams offers a clear benefit with respect to shorter treatment delivery times and reduced dose spillage.

Support and care for older subjects are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed of family, friends and neighbors, who are essential in helping older persons to continue living at home. It has been shown that the extent and diversity of informal tasks may jeopardize the physical, mental and social wellbeing of caregivers.  Methods/design:   The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly cohort is to define, through a longitudinal study, profiles of caregivers of older patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal), neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases), neurovascular diseases (stroke), sensory diseases (age-related macular degeneration (AMD)) and heart disease (heart failure). Patients must be at least 60 years old and living in the region of Burgundy-Franche-Comte (France). By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers, coping strategies, levels of anxiety and depression, social support and the extent of their burden. We will also evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the implementation of a pragmatic intervention by a social worker to help informal caregivers, through a randomized interventional trial nested in the cohort. Qualitative approaches aimed at studying the caregiver/patient relationship, and situations leading to breakdown of the caregiver relationship will be also undertaken.  Discussion:   Through an analytical and longitudinal definition of profiles of informal caregivers, this study will gather detailed information on their life courses and their health trajectory by identifying consequences associated with the concept of their role as carers. In addition, the randomized interventional trial will explore the relevance of the implementation of a supportive intervention by a social worker to help caregivers. These data will help to identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid and to propose new approaches to help caregivers.

Polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene may lead to its altered production/activity and such modulate susceptibility to prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the -607 and +105 polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene and the risk of prostate cancer development and progression in Slovak population. The study was performed using 425 patients with prostate cancer, 270 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) and 263 healthy male controls. The statistically significant association of the -607 AC genotype (OR = 2.24; p < 0.001), CC genotype (OR = 1.86; p = 0.006), as well as C allele (OR = 1.27; p = 0.033) with the higher risk of prostate cancer development was observed. No association of the IL-18 -607 polymorphism and BHP was detected. The subset analysis revealed the significant association of the -607 AC genotype (OR = 2.01; p = 0.008) with development of higher-grade carcinomas (Gleason score ≥7) and the strong association of the -607 AC genotype (OR = 3.11; p < 0.001), CC genotype (OR = 2.96; p < 0.001) as well as C allele (OR = 1.51; p = 0.003) with the higher risk of prostate cancer development in the group of patients with PSA < 10 ng/ml. The -607 AC genotype was also connected with significantly higher IL-18 plasma concentrations. No association between the IL-18 +105 polymorphism and prostate cancer was observed. The analysis of the distribution of the -607 and +105 haplotypes showed significant association of the - 607 C/ + 105 A and - 607 C/ + 105 C haplotypes with the risk of prostate cancer. This study found that the IL-18 -607 promoter polymorphism could contribute to prostate cancer development in Slovak population. Its presence was also associated with development of higher-grade carcinomas and therefore may influences the prognosis and aggressiveness of the disease.""","""['J Jurecekova', 'E Babusikova', 'M Kmetova Sivonova', 'H Drobkova', 'M Petras', 'J Kliment', 'E Halasova']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin-18 gene and risk of prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Interleukin-6 Polymorphism (rs1800795) in Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Pro-(IL-18) and Anti-(IL-10) Inflammatory Promoter Genetic Variants (Intrinsic Factors) with Tobacco Exposure (Extrinsic Factors) May Influence Susceptibility and Severity of Prostate Carcinoma: A Prospective Study.', 'CYP17 polymorphisms in relation to risks of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based study in China.', 'Review and pooled analysis of studies on -607(C/A) and -137(G/C) polymorphisms in IL-18 and cancer risk.', 'Inhibition of CDC20 potentiates anti-tumor immunity through facilitating GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in prostate cancer.', 'Relevance of Interleukins 6 and 8 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Prostate Cancer: A Multicenter Study.', 'A Specific IL6 Polymorphic Genotype Modulates the Risk of Trypanosoma cruzi Parasitemia While IL18, IL17A, and IL1B Variant Profiles and HIV Infection Protect Against Cardiomyopathy in Chagas Disease.', 'The Multifaceted Roles of Pyroptotic Cell Death Pathways in Cancer.', 'Association between IL-18 -607 C/A Polymorphism and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Case-Control Studies.']"""

This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms and identify the potential molecular biomarkers of PCa. The microarray profile GSE38241 including 18 prostate cancer metastasis and 21 normal prostate samples was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Limma. DEGs functions were investigated by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis. Moreover, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed, followed by functional analysis of modules. Additionally, pathway crosstalk network was constructed by integrating PPI network and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways. Totally, 334 up - and 703 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The functions of up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms of cell cycle phase and cell cycle process. While down-regulated DEGs mainly participated in actin filament-based process. Among these pathways in the pathway crosstalk network, T cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathways, endometrial cancer and glioma were found to play critical roles during PC progression. Cell division cycle 45 (CDC45), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5) and cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) may be useful markers for predicting tumor metastasis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of PCa patients. Moreover, the pathway crosstalk network provides the groundwork that targeting multiple pathways might be more effective than targeting one pathway alone.""","""['H Y Li', 'N Jin', 'Y P Han', 'X F Jin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Identification of prostate cancer hub genes and therapeutic agents using bioinformatics approach.', 'Identiﬁcation of candidate biomarkers and pathways associated with SCLC by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analyses of significant genes, related pathways and candidate prognostic biomarkers in glioblastoma.', 'The identification of key genes and pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput data.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying gliomas and glioblastoma pathogenesis revealed by bioinformatics analysis of microarray data.', 'Integrated pathway and network analyses of metabolomic alterations in peripheral blood of patients with depression.', 'Comprehensive analysis of fatty acid metabolism-related gene signatures for predicting prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Deciphering cervical cancer-associated biomarkers by integrated multi-omics approach.', 'GPX2 predicts recurrence-free survival and triggers the Wnt/β-catenin/EMT pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Key Genes and Signalings Associated with the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

We examined the association of the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 FA (ω-6:ω-3) and individual FA components with pathological results among men with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Sixty-nine men were included in the study. Components of ω-6 (linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA)) and ω-3 (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass selective detector separation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine association of FA with pathological high grade (Gleason ≥4+3) disease.  Results:   The were 35 men with low grade disease (Gleason ≤3+4) and 34 men with high grade disease. Men with low grade disease were significantly younger (58y vs 61y, p = 0.012) and had lower D'Amico clinical classification (p = 0.001) compared to men with high grade disease. There was no significant association of ω-6:ω-3 with high grade disease (OR 0.93, p = 0.78), however overall ω-6, ω-3, and individual components of ω-6 and ω-3 FAs except EPA were significantly associated with high grade disease (ω-6: OR 3.37, 95% CI: 1.27,8.98; LA: OR 3.33, 95% CI:1.24,8.94; AA: OR 2.93, 95% CI:1.24,6.94; DGLA: OR 3.21, 95% CI:1.28,8.04; ω-3: OR 3.47, 95% CI:1.22,9.83; DHA: OR 3.13, 95% CI:1.26,7.74). ω-6 and ω-3 FA components were highly correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.77).

However, analysis of morphologically defined subgroups revealed, that 8p deletion lacked prognostic significance in subgroups with very good (Gleason ≤ 3 + 3, 3 + 4 with ≤ 5% Gleason 4) or very poor prognosis (pT3b, Gleason ≥ 8, pN1). 8p deletions were markedly more frequent in cancers with (53.5%) than without PTEN deletions (36.4%; P < 0,0001) and were slightly more frequent in ERG-positive (40.9%) than in ERG-negative cancers (34.7%, P < 0.0001) due to the association with the ERG-associated PTEN deletion. Cancers with 8p/PTEN co-deletions had a strikingly worse prognosis than cancers with deletion of PTEN or 8p alone (P ≤ 0.0003). In summary, 8p deletion is an independent prognostic parameter in prostate cancer that may act synergistically with PTEN deletions.

Accordingly, identification of environmental factors that facilitate progression to more aggressive stages is critical for disease prevention. Although calcium-enriched diets have been speculated to increase prostate cancer risk, their impact on early-stage tumors remains unexplored. In this study, we addressed this issue with a large interventional animal study. Mouse models of fully penetrant and slowly evolving prostate tumorigenesis showed that a high calcium diet dramatically accelerated the progression of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, by promoting cell proliferation, micro-invasion, tissue inflammation, and expression of acknowledged prostate cancer markers. Strikingly, dietary vitamin D prevented these calcium-triggered tumorigenic effects. Expression profiling and in vitro mechanistic studies showed that stimulation of PC-3 cells with extracellular Ca2+ resulted in an increase in cell proliferation rate, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) amplitude, cationic channel TRPC6, and calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) expression. Notably, administration of the active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol reversed all these effects. Silencing CaSR or TRPC6 expression in calcium-stimulated PC3 cells decreased cell proliferation and SOCE. Overall, our results demonstrate the protective effects of vitamin D supplementation in blocking the progression of early-stage prostate lesions induced by a calcium-rich diet.

In Australia, more than 40% are over 50 years - an age where cancer incidence rises rapidly, but when screening may reduce cancer mortality. Nurses and midwives are important health role models for the population, but their engagement in cancer screening is unknown.  Design:   A cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014-2015.  Methods:   Data were obtained from the 'Fit for the Future' study on 5041 working nurses and midwives in New South Wales, Australia and analyses were conducted on subsets of age-eligible respondents. Demographic, geographical and occupational data were analysed in relation to population-based screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancers and opportunistic screening for prostate and skin cancer screening participation, in line with Australian recommendations.  Results:   Nurses' and midwives' recent screening rates were higher than the Australian general population across relevant age groups. Compared with full-time nurses and midwives, part-time/casual/pool workers were significantly more likely to undertake cervical, breast and bowel screening. Compared with those working office hours, shift workers were significantly less likely to undertake breast and bowel screening, but more likely to undertake skin screening.  Conclusions:   Disparities in reported screening prevalence and factors predictive of screening uptake indicate opportunities for targeted strategies to inform and/or promote workforce engagement with screening programmes and protect the health of this ageing workforce.""","""['Rachel Nicholls', 'Lin Perry', 'Robyn Gallagher', 'Christine Duffield', 'David Sibbritt', 'Xiaoyue Xu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Adv Nurs""","""[""Health, workforce characteristics, quality of life and intention to leave: The 'Fit for the Future' survey of Australian nurses and midwives."", ""Culture, teams, and organizations: A qualitative exploration of female nurses' and midwives' experiences of urinary symptoms at work."", 'A cross-sectional analysis of patterns of obesity in a cohort of working nurses and midwives in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.', 'Cancer screening in France: 10\xa0years of analysis of behaviours by the EDIFICE surveys.', 'An Integrative Literature Review of the Factors That Contribute to Professional Nurses and Midwives Making Sound Clinical Decisions.', 'The Relationship between Risk Levels of Breast Cancer and Use of Early Diagnosis and Screening Services in Healthcare Workers in Turkey.', 'Risk factors and relationship between screening periodicity and risk of cervical cancer among nurses and midwives.

The aberrant expression of MEK5 has been reported in various malignant diseases including cancers of breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and brain. However, the function and regulation of MEK5 signaling pathway are ambiguous and remain elusive with respect to its oncogenic roles in various cancers, especially in the regulation of the initiation and progression of cancer invasion and metastasis. Ectopic expression of MEK5 or knockdown of MEK5 by shRNA with in vitro cell based models demonstrated the role of MEK5 in regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that MEK5 upregulated by Stat3 promotes breast cancer cell invasion through EMT. Further study demonstrated that Stat3 could bind to promoter region of MEK5 and enhanced MEK5 transcription and expression. In addition, the phosphorylation of MEK5 significantly increased in breast cancer cells corresponding to metastatic capability of breast cancer cells. The depletion of MEK5 by shRNA significantly decreased breast cancer invasion. Ectopic expression of MEK5 could confer non-invasive breast cancer cells to become invasion capable cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Erk5, a MEK5-regulated downstream kinase, was also upregulated consistent with the increased level of active MEK5. Our studies provide insights into a molecular mechanism by which MEK5 transcriptionally upregulated by Stat3 augments breast cancer cell EMT, which subsequently enhances cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This finding may suggest that Stat3 and MEK5/Erk5 pathways could be an effective therapeutic target for inhibition of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.""","""['Fang Liu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Hui Song']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['A kinome-wide high-content siRNA screen identifies MEK5-ERK5 signaling as critical for breast cancer cell EMT and metastasis.', 'Proteomic analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha resistant human breast cancer cells reveals a MEK5/Erk5-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype.', 'MEK5/ERK5 signaling suppresses estrogen receptor expression and promotes hormone-independent tumorigenesis.', 'Oncogenic signaling of MEK5-ERK5.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition Regulated by ERK5 Signaling.', 'MEK5-ERK5 Axis Promotes Self-renewal and Tumorigenicity of Glioma Stem Cells.', 'Aberrant MEK5 signalling promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma development via mTOR activation.', 'BAY-885, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 inhibitor, induces apoptosis by regulating the endoplasmic reticulum stress/Mcl-1/Bim pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'Clinical Significance and Regulation of ERK5 Expression and Function in Cancer.', 'The novel STAT3 inhibitor WZ-2-033 causes regression of human triple-negative breast cancer and gastric cancer xenografts.']"""

In practice, the initial contrast used to outline the upper tracts is commonly discarded with subsequent saline washings sent for cytology. We hypothesize that contrast washings do not affect the morphology of urothelial carcinoma cells or the integrity of cytology interpretation.  Methods:   Samples obtained from (1) human bladder cell lines; (2) urine from a human xenograft bladder cancer model using UC-3 cells; and (3) patients with urothelial carcinoma were subjected to various experimental solutions (water, saline, urine, and dilutions of contrast media) for different exposure times. After exposure to various different solutions, samples underwent cytological analysis to assess morphologic and degenerative changes.  Results:   No cytological differences were seen when cells were exposed to ionic, hyperosmolar, or non-ionic low-osmolar contrast agents for any exposures up to five minutes. Cells exposed to mixtures of contrast agents and urine also demonstrated no evidence of degenerative change. Cells exposed to water for greater than one minute demonstrated significant hydropic degeneration impacting cytological interpretation. At 40 minutes or later, all reagents caused severe degeneration when evaluating urine samples from the mouse bladder cancer model and from patients undergoing urothelial carcinoma.  Conclusions:   Commonly used contrast agents have no effect on urinary cytology up to five minutes.

We sought to characterize the M1 population seen in routine clinical practice using a commercial claims database.  Patients and methods:   A US claims (2000-2013) database was used to identify patients with an index diagnosis of prostate cancer. M1 patients were identified by ""International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification"" diagnosis codes of metastasis to bone, viscera, distant lymph node, and unspecified sites within 90 days of the prostate cancer diagnosis. Progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer was identified by exposure to ≥ 1 drugs approved for castration-resistant prostate cancer, including docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, mitoxantrone, estramustine, and radium-223.  Results:   Among 326,907 patients with an index prostate cancer diagnosis, 9199 (2.8%) had M1 disease, including 6955 with specified metastatic disease involving the bone (77%), viscera (38%), or lymph nodes (21%). The initial treatment of M1 disease was castration in 51%, localized therapy in 16%, prostate cancer drug only in 18%, and no treatment in 15%. The median time to first castration was 33 days.  Conclusion:   The proportion of men with prostate cancer who presented with M1 disease was consistent with other observations. Only 51% of the patients were treated according to national guidelines recommending medical or surgical castration.

However, BCR does not necessarily portend worse survival outcomes.  Objective:   To assess the significance of distinguishing GS 8 versus 9-10 disease in terms of long-term survival outcomes for both the preoperative setting using biopsy (Bx) GS and the postoperative setting with RP GS.  Design, setting, and participants:   Of 23918 men who underwent RP between 1984 and 2014, there were 721 men with biopsy GS 8-10, and 1047 men with RP GS 8-10.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between men with GS 8 and those with GS 9-10. We compared all-cause mortality (ACM) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) risk between the groups using Cox regression and competing-risks analyses, adjusting for other perioperative variables and death from other causes as the competing event.  Results and limitations:   Compared to men with GS 8, men with GS 9-10 had later RP year and higher pathologic stage. Among men with Bx GS 8-10, 115 died (82 due to PC) with median follow-up of 3 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 1-7) for both overall and cancer-specific survival. Of men with RP GS 8-10, 221 died (151 due to PC) with median follow-up of 4 yr (IQR 2-8) and 4 yr (IQR 2-9) for overall and cancer-specific survival, respectively. PC-specific survival rates were significantly lower for men with GS 9-10 compared to men with GS 8 for both Bx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-3.30; p<0.01) and RP GS (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.74-3.28; p<0.01). This association persisted in multivariable models after adjusting for perioperative variables.  Conclusions:   Men with GS 9-10 had higher ACM and PCSM rates compared to those with GS 8. GS 8 and GS 9-10 PC should be considered separately in both the preoperative and postoperative setting as suggested by the new PCGS.  Patient summary:   The prostate cancer grading system can predict mortality risk after radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with Gleason score 8-10 disease based on both biopsy and RP Gleason scores.

These programs advise to avoid exposure to sunlight. However, the question arises whether sun-shunning behaviour might have an effect on general health. During the last decades new favourable associations between sunlight and disease have been discovered. There is growing observational and experimental evidence that regular exposure to sunlight contributes to the prevention of colon-, breast-, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. Initially, these beneficial effects were ascribed to vitamin D. Recently it became evident that immunomodulation, the formation of nitric oxide, melatonin, serotonin, and the effect of (sun)light on circadian clocks, are involved as well. In Europe (above 50 degrees north latitude), the risk of skin cancer (particularly melanoma) is mainly caused by an intermittent pattern of exposure, while regular exposure confers a relatively low risk.

However, CBZ is not a suitable substrate for p-glycoprotein 60, an efflux pump which transports anticancer drugs out of malignant cells and is therefore a promising drug for treatment of multidrug resistant tumors. Similar to other taxanes, the presence of Tween 80 in the CBZ formulation shows that it is insoluble in water.  Methods:   In order to increase the solubility and circulation time of this drug, CBZ-human serum albumin (HSA) conjugate was synthesized. The designed linker was composed of methacrylic acid and N-acetyl cysteine to increase the solubility of CBZ and to increase the efficiency of conjugation. Targeting was performed by poly(ethylene glycol)-folic acid amide bound formation with carboxyl groups of HSA during in the step of nanoparticle formation. Cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro on HT-29, as a folate negative cell line, and MDA-MB-231, as a folate positive cell line.  Results:   H-NMR, Gel Permeation Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography and UV spectrophotometry analysis confirmed the composition of conjugates. The resulting nanoparticles had a spherical shape, narrow size distribution and mean diameter of 138 nm. The efficiency of conjugation was 41.6 %. The IC50 of CBZ in targeted nanoparticles was 10.1 and 17.4% lower than that of the free CBZ for HT-29 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.

Methods:   We relied on 10 024 patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries. Logistic regression analyses focused on grade and stage. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed cancer-specific mortality rates in adenocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Cox regression analyses assessed the impact of histological subtype on cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Overall, 215 (2.1%) adenocarcinoma and 9809 (97.9%) urothelial carcinoma patients were identified. The rate of non-organ-confined disease was higher in adenocarcinoma (64.7% vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, adenocarcinoma patients had a 2.2-fold higher risk of harboring non-organ-confined disease (95% confidence interval 1.7-3.0; P < 0.001) than urothelial carcinoma patients. Cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates were lower in adenocarcinoma (P < 0.01). This disadvantage only applied to non-organ-confined disease (P = 0.044), and not to organ-confined disease (P = 0.9). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, adenocarcinoma conferred a 1.3-fold higher rate of cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.60; P = 0.01).

An oversimplified view in the literature is that cancer cells become more deformable as they become more invasive. β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling drives invasion and metastasis, but the effects on cell deformability are not known. Here, we show that activation of β-adrenergic signaling by βAR agonists reduces the deformability of highly metastatic human breast cancer cells, and that these stiffer cells are more invasive in vitro We find that βAR activation also reduces the deformability of ovarian, prostate, melanoma and leukemia cells. Mechanistically, we show that βAR-mediated cell stiffening depends on the actin cytoskeleton and myosin II activity. These changes in cell deformability can be prevented by pharmacological β-blockade or genetic knockout of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Our results identify a β2-adrenergic-Ca2+-actin axis as a new regulator of cell deformability, and suggest that the relationship between cell mechanical properties and invasion might be dependent on context.""","""['Tae-Hyung Kim', 'Navjot Kaur Gill', 'Kendra D Nyberg', 'Angelyn V Nguyen', 'Sophia V Hohlbauch', 'Nicholas A Geisse', 'Cameron J Nowell', 'Erica K Sloan', 'Amy C Rowat']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['β2-adrenoceptor signaling regulates invadopodia formation to enhance tumor cell invasion.', 'The β2-adrenoceptor activates a positive cAMP-calcium feedforward loop to drive breast cancer cell invasion.', 'Identification of novel competing β2AR phospho-extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways in human trabecular meshwork cells.', 'Beta-adrenergic signaling in the heart: dual coupling of the beta2-adrenergic receptor to G(s) and G(i) proteins.', 'Beta-adrenergic receptors in cancer: therapeutic implications.', 'Matrix obstructions cause multiscale disruption in collective epithelial migration by suppressing leader cell function.', 'High extracellular glucose promotes cell motility by modulating cell deformability and contractility via the cAMP-RhoA-ROCK axis in human breast cancer cells.', 'Transcription Factor E2F1 Regulates the Expression of ADRB2.', 'Expression of vimentin alters cell mechanics, cell-cell adhesion, and gene expression profiles suggesting the induction of a hybrid EMT in human mammary epithelial cells.', 'Tuning immunity through tissue mechanotransduction.']"""

Accumulating evidence suggests that the available treatment options, including surgery and conservative treatment, result in a similar prognosis for most men with localized prostate cancer. However, approximately 90% of patients choose surgery over conservative treatment, despite the risk of severe side effects like erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Recent medical research suggests that a key reason is the lack of patient-centered tools that can effectively communicate personalized risk information and enable them to make better health decisions. In this paper, we report the iterative design process and results of developing the PROgnosis Assessment for Conservative Treatment (PROACT) tool, a personalized health risk communication tool for localized prostate cancer patients. PROACT utilizes two published clinical prediction models to communicate the patients' personalized risk estimates and compare treatment options. In collaboration with the Maine Medical Center, we conducted two rounds of evaluations with prostate cancer survivors and urologists to identify the design elements and narrative structure that effectively facilitate patient comprehension under emotional distress. Our results indicate that visualization can be an effective means to communicate complex risk information to patients with low numeracy and visual literacy. However, the visualizations need to be carefully chosen to balance readability with ease of comprehension. In addition, due to patients' charged emotional state, an intuitive narrative structure that considers the patients' information need is critical to aid the patients' comprehension of their risk information.""","""['Anzu Hakone', 'Lane Harrison', 'Alvitta Ottley', 'Nathan Winters', 'Caitlin Gutheil', 'Paul K J Han', 'Remco Chang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph""","""['Relevance of graph literacy in the development of patient-centered communication tools.', 'Providing guidance for genomics-based cancer treatment decisions: insights from stakeholder engagement for post-prostatectomy radiation therapy.', 'Designing Normative Messages About Active Surveillance for Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Risk management frameworks for human health and environmental risks.', 'myBeST-A Web-Based Survival Prognostic Tool for Women with Breast Cancer in Malaysia: Development Process and Preliminary Validation Study.', 'A tool to help patients visualize ASCVD risk and the potential impact of risk-lowering interventions.', ""Need for numbers: assessing cancer survivors' needs for personalized and generic statistical information."", 'Comparing the Value of Data Visualization Methods for Communicating Harms in Clinical Trials.', 'Risky business: a scoping review for communicating results of predictive models between providers and patients.']"""

Materials and Methods A phase II prospective clinical trial of the poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in mCRPC included a prospective magnetic resonance (MR) imaging substudy; the study was approved by the institutional research board, and written informed consent was obtained. Whole-body DWI was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of olaparib administration by using 1.5-T MR imaging. Areas of abnormal signal intensity on DWI images in keeping with bone metastases were delineated to derive total diffusion volume (tDV); five target lesions were also evaluated. Associations of changes in volume of bone metastases and median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with response to treatment were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression; correlation with prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count were assessed by using Spearman correlation (r). Results Twenty-one patients were included. All six responders to olaparib showed a decrease in tDV, while no decrease was observed in all nonresponders; this difference between responders and nonresponders was significant (P = .001). Increases in median ADC were associated with increased odds of response (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.15; P = .04). A positive association was detected between changes in tDV and best percentage change in prostate-specific antigen level and circulating tumor cell count (r = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.83] and r = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.90], respectively). When assessing five target lesions, decreases in volume were associated with response (odds ratio for volume increase, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99; P = .037). Conclusion This pilot study showed that decreases in volume and increases in median ADC of bone metastases assessed with whole-body DWI can potentially be used as indicators of response to olaparib in mCRPC.

Therefore, our primary objective was to compare the anesthetic management between these 2 groups. Our secondary objective was to determine the incidence of adverse outcomes associated with RALP, which requires an extreme Trendelenburg position.  Design:   A retrospective observational study.  Setting:   University teaching hospital.  Patients:   A total of 223 men, consisting of 97 LRP patients and 126 RALP patients, treated during a 3-year period (January 2010-December 2012) were retrospectively studied.  Interventions:   None.  Measurements:   Information on patient demographics, type of anesthesia, anesthetic/pneumoperitoneum/surgical times, intraoperative fluids and blood products, estimated blood loss, intraoperative and postoperative opioid use, postoperative analgesic consumption, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit, postoperative complications, and hospital stays was collected and compared.  Main results:   The estimated blood loss was higher in LRP patients than in RALP patients (median, 550 mL vs 200 mL; P < .001). Likewise, 24% of the LRP patients received intraoperative transfusions compared with 0.79% of the RALP patients (P < .001). The RALP patients had a longer anesthesia time (median, 276 vs 259 minutes; P = .032) and a greater intraoperative use of opioids (P < .001). The incidence of complications was similar in both groups with the exception of postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were observed more frequently among the RALP patients than among the LRP patients (33% vs 16%; P = .007).  Conclusions:   This is the first report to compare the anesthetic management of RALP vs LRP. Anesthesiologists can expect RALP surgery to be associated with less blood loss and a need for fewer blood products than traditional LRP surgery.

Diagnostic strategies that comprehensively assess the functional complexity of tumor immune infiltrates could have wide-reaching clinical value. In previous work we identified distinct immune gene signatures in breast tumors that reflect the relative abundance of infiltrating immune cells and exhibited significant associations with patient outcomes. Here we hypothesized that immune gene signatures agnostic to tumor type can be identified by de novo discovery of gene clusters enriched for immunological functions and possessing internal correlation structure conserved across solid tumors from different anatomic sites.  Methods:   We assembled microarray expression datasets encompassing 5,295 tumors of the breast, colon, lung, ovarian and prostate. Unsupervised clustering methods were used to determine number and composition of gene clusters within each dataset. Immune-enriched gene clusters (signatures) identified by gene ontology enrichment were analyzed for internal correlation structure and conservation across tumors then compared against expression profiles of: 1) flow-sorted leukocytes from peripheral blood and 2) >300 cancer cell lines from solid and hematologic cancers. Cox regression analysis was used to identify signatures with significant associations with clinical outcome.  Results:   We identified nine distinct immune-enriched gene signatures conserved across all five tumor types. The signatures differentiated specific leukocyte lineages with moderate discernment overall, and naturally organized into six discrete groups indicative of admixed lineages. Moreover, seven of the signatures exhibit minimal and uncorrelated expression in cancer cell lines, suggesting that these signatures derive predominantly from infiltrating immune cells. All nine immune signatures achieved statistically significant associations with patient prognosis (p<0.05) in one or more tumor types with greatest significance observed in breast and skin cancers. Several signatures indicative of myeloid lineages exhibited poor outcome associations that were most apparent in brain and colon cancers.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that tumor infiltrating immune cells can be differentiated by immune-specific gene expression patterns that quantify the relative abundance of multiple immune infiltrates across a range of solid tumor types. That these markers of immune involvement are significantly associated with patient prognosis in diverse cancers suggests their clinical utility as pan-cancer markers of tumor behavior and immune responsiveness.""","""['Julia Chifman', 'Ashok Pullikuth', 'Jeff W Chou', 'Davide Bedognetti', 'Lance D Miller']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Co-expression modules identified from published immune signatures reveal five distinct immune subtypes in breast cancer.', 'Impact of Tumor Purity on Immune Gene Expression and Clustering Analyses across Multiple Cancer Types.', 'The prognostic landscape of genes and infiltrating immune cells across human cancers.', '""Stemness"" genomics law governs clinical behavior of human cancer: implications for decision making in disease management.', 'Molecular signatures in breast cancer.', 'A Blood-Based Immune Gene Signature with Prognostic Significance in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'A large-scale screening and functional sorting of tumour microenvironment prognostic genes for breast cancer patients.', 'T-Cell Infiltration and Clonality May Identify Distinct Survival Groups in Colorectal Cancer: Development and Validation of a Prognostic Model Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC).', 'NXPH4 Used as a New Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Marker for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Advances in CRISPR/Cas9.']"""

MTT cell viability assays were carried out to assess the effect of the DNA-PBNPs drug. The results showed that the dODN molecules were successfully conjugated to the MUA modified PBNPs via amide and/or disulfide bond formation and could thus be successfully delivered into the cancer cells. The control experiments showed that the unconjugated dODN molecules were not able to enter the cancer cells no matter whether non-functionalized PBNPs were present or not. It was also found that the DNA-PBNPs drugs were internalized and then distributed homogeneously throughout the cell, including cytoplasmic and nucleic regions, after endocytosis.

If follow-up time is short, this association may be confounded by subclinical disease already present at the time of CRF assessment. This study investigates the association between CRF and death from cancer and any cause with 42 years and 44 years of follow-up, respectively.  Setting, participants and main outcome measures:   Middle-aged, employed and cancer-free Danish men from the prospective Copenhagen Male Study, enrolled in 1970-1971, were included. CRF (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)) was estimated using a bicycle ergometer test and analysed in multivariable Cox models including conventional risk factors, social class and self-reported physical activity. Death from cancer and all-cause mortality was assessed using Danish national registers. Follow-up was 100% complete.  Results:   In total, 5131 men were included, mean (SD) age 48.8 (5.4) years. During 44 years of follow-up, 4486 subjects died (87.4%), 1527 (29.8%) from cancer. In multivariable models, CRF was highly significantly inversely associated with death from cancer and all-cause mortality ((HR (95% CI)) 0.83 (0.77 to 0.90) and 0.89 (0.85 to 0.93) per 10 mL/kg/min increase in estimated VO2max, respectively). A similar association was seen across specific cancer groups, except death from prostate cancer (1.00 (0.82 to 1.2); p=0.97; n=231). The associations between CRF and outcomes remained essentially unchanged after excluding subjects dying within 10 years (n=377) and 20 years (n=1276) of inclusion.  Conclusions:   CRF is highly significantly inversely associated with death from cancer and all-cause mortality.

Materials and methods:   Twenty selected men with oligometastatic M1a (extrapelvic nodal disease) or M1b (bone disease) at diagnosis were treated using a multimodal approach that included androgen deprivation, radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy (retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in the presence of clinically positive retroperitoneal nodes), and stereotactic body radiotherapy to osseous disease or the primary site. Outcomes of each treatment were assessed sequentially. Androgen deprivation was discontinued in responding patients. The primary end point was an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after testosterone recovery. The goal was to eliminate all detectable disease.  Results:   Each treatment modality contributed to the outcome: 95% of the cohort achieved an undetectable PSA with multimodal treatment, including 25% of patients after androgen deprivation alone and an additional 50% and 20% after surgery and radiotherapy, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients (95% confidence interval: 3%-38%) achieved the primary end point, which persisted for 5, 6, 27+ , and 46+ months.

Objective:   To assess the impact of additional radiation therapy (RT) and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on urinary continence, potency, and quality of life (QoL) after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Among 13150 men who underwent RP from 1992 to 2013, 905 received RP + RT, 407 RP + ADT and 688 RP + RT + ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Urinary function, sexual function, and overall QoL were evaluated annually using self-administered validated questionnaires. Propensity score-matched and bootstrap analyses were performed, and the distributions for all functional outcomes were analyzed as a function of time after RP.  Results and limitations:   Patients who received RP + RT had a 4% higher overall incontinence rate 3 yr after surgery, and 1% higher rate for severe incontinence (>3 pads/24h) compared to matched RP-only patients. ADT further increased the overall and severe incontinence rates by 4% and 3%, respectively, compared to matched RP + RT patients. RP + RT was associated with an 18% lower rate of potency compared to RP alone, while RP + RT + ADT was associated with a further 17% reduction compared to RP + RT. Additional RT reduced QoL by 10% and additional ADT by a further 12% compared to RP only and RP + RT, respectively. The timing of RT after RP had no influence on continence, but adjuvant compared to salvage RT was associated with significantly lower potency (37% vs 45%), but higher QoL (60% vs 56%). Limitations of our study include the observational study design and potential for selection bias in the treatments received.  Conclusions:   Secondary RT and ADT after RP have an additive negative influence on urinary function, potency, and QoL. Patients with high-risk disease should be counseled before RP on the potential net impairment of functional outcomes due to multimodal treatment.

Although EGFR is a membrane receptor, it undergoes nuclear translocation, where it has a distinct signalling pathway. Herein, we report a novel mechanism by which cancer cells can directly transport EGFR to the nucleus of other cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). The transported receptor is active and stimulates the nuclear EGFR pathways. Interestingly, the translocation of EGFR via EVs occurs independently of the nuclear localisation sequence that is required for nuclear translocation of endogenous EGFR. Also, we found that the mutant receptor EGFRvIII could be transported to the nucleus of other cells via EVs. To assess the role of EVs in the regulation of an actual nuclear receptor, we studied the regulation of androgen receptor (AR). We found that full-length AR and mutant variant ARv7 are secreted in EVs derived from prostate cancer cell lines and could be transported to the nucleus of AR-null cells. The EV-derived AR was able to bind the androgen-responsive promoter region of prostate specific antigen, and recruit RNA Pol II, an indication of active transcription. The nuclear-translocated AR via EVs enhanced the proliferation of acceptor cells in the absence of androgen. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear localisation of AR could occur in vivo via orthotopically-injected EVs in male SCID mice prostate glands. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the nuclear translocation of nuclear receptors via EVs, which significantly extends the role of EVs as paracrine transcriptional regulators.""","""['Jolene Read', 'Alistair Ingram', 'Hassan A Al Saleh', 'Khrystyna Platko', 'Kathleen Gabriel', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Jehonathan Pinthus', 'Fadwa Majeed', 'Talha Qureshi', 'Khalid Al-Nedawi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Corrigendum to ""Nuclear transportation of exogenous epidermal growth factor receptor and androgen receptor via extracellular vesicles"" Eur J Cancer 70 (2017) 62-74.', 'Alterations in the expression of androgen receptor, wild type-epidermal growth factor receptor and a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor in human prostate cancer.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in the Adaptive Process of Prostate Cancer during Inhibition of Androgen Receptor Signaling by Enzalutamide.', 'The androgen receptor and prostate cancer invasion.', 'Prostate cancer: a model of integration of genomic and non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor in cell lines model.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Brain Tumor Progression.', 'Roles of Extracellular Vesicles on the Progression and Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'An Overview of EGFR Mechanisms and Their Implications in Targeted Therapies for Glioblastoma.', 'Extracellular vesicles: A dive into their role in the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression.', 'Characterization of proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs of circulating extracellular vesicles from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy subjects.', 'Anti-Human CD9 Fab Fragment Antibody Blocks the Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Increase in Malignancy of Colon Cancer Cells.']"""

Notably, compound 12 possesses not only tubulin and HDAC inhibitory activity but also shows HDAC6 selectivity over other HDAC isoforms. In addition, it exhibits remarkable inhibitory activity against the growth cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (PC3 and RPMI-8226 cells). Notably, it suppresses the growth of multiple myeloma xenografts without leading to the death of teated animals like reference compound. In sum, this study provided potential compounds with safer profiles for cancer treatment.""","""['Hsueh-Yun Lee', 'Jiann-Fong Lee', 'Sunil Kumar', 'Yi-Wen Wu', 'Wei-Chun HuangFu', 'Mei-Jung Lai', 'Yu-Hsuan Li', 'Hsiang-Ling Huang', 'Fei-Chiao Kuo', 'Che-Jen Hsiao', 'Chun-Chun Cheng', 'Chia-Ron Yang', 'Jing-Ping Liou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['A novel small molecule hybrid of vorinostat and DACA displays anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer through dual inhibition of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase I.', '4-Indolyl-N-hydroxyphenylacrylamides as potent HDAC class I and IIB inhibitors in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo.', 'Discovery of a 2,6-diarylpyridine-based hydroxamic acid derivative as novel histone deacetylase 8 and tubulin dual inhibitor for the treatment of neuroblastoma.', 'Indole molecules as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization: potential new anticancer agents.', 'Structure-activity relationships of hydroxamate-based histone deacetylase-8 inhibitors: reality behind anticancer drug discovery.', 'Shifting the paradigm in treating multi-factorial diseases: polypharmacological co-inhibitors of HDAC6.', 'A General and Scalable Synthesis of Polysubstituted Indoles.', 'Effect of 3-subsitution of quinolinehydroxamic acids on selectivity of histone deacetylase isoforms.', 'Cytotoxic substituted indolizines as new colchicine site tubulin polymerisation inhibitors.', 'Design and synthesis of diazine-based panobinostat analogues for HDAC8 inhibition.']"""

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between dog ownership and PA among cancer survivors and to examine correlates of dog ownership.  Methods:   A stratified random sample of 2062 breast cancer survivors, prostate cancer survivors, and colorectal cancer survivors was mailed a questionnaire assessing PA, social cognitive, dog ownership, demographic, and medical variables.  Results:   Overall, 25% of the sample was dog owners (DOs). There were no significant differences in moderate, vigorous, or total PA minutes between DOs and non-dog owners. There was a significant difference in light PA minutes in favor of DOs (153 vs 112 minutes; 95% CI = 4 to 77; P = .030), however, this was largely restricted to breast cancer survivors (143 vs 79 minutes; 95% CI = 25 to 102; P = .001) who also reported fewer vigorous PA minutes (18 vs 39 minutes; 95% CI = -42 to -1; P = .042). Survivors were more likely to be DOs if they had breast cancer (P = .054), a higher income (P = .021), radiation therapy (P = .029), chemotherapy (P = .010), were younger (P < .001), employed (P < .001), and a current smoker (P = .015). Few social cognitive variables were associated with DO.  Conclusions:   Dog ownership among cancer survivors was not associated with moderate-to-vigorous PA but was associated with light PA.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that photodynamically-stressed prostate cancer PC3 cells can elicit nitric oxide (NO)-mediated pro-growth/migration responses in non-stressed bystander cells. A novel approach was used whereby both cell populations existed on a culture dish, but made no physical contact with one other. Visible light irradiation of target cells sensitized with 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX resulted in a striking upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) along with NO, the level of which increased after irradiation. Slower and less pronounced iNOS/NO upregulation was also observed in bystander cells. Activation of transcription factor NF-κB was implicated in iNOS induction in both targeted and bystander cells. Like surviving targeted cells, bystanders exhibited a significant increase in growth and migration rate, both responses being strongly attenuated by an iNOS inhibitor (1400W), a NO scavenger (cPTIO), or iNOS knockdown. Incubating bystander cells with conditioned medium from targeted cells failed to stimulate growth/migration, ruling out involvement of relatively long-lived stimulants. The following post-irradiation changes in pro-survival/pro-growth proteins were observed in bystander cells: upregulation of COX-2 and activation of protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2, NO again playing a key role. This is the first reported evidence for NO-enhanced bystander aggressiveness in the context of PDT. In the clinical setting, such effects could be averted through pharmacologic use of iNOS inhibitors as PDT adjuvants.""","""['Jerzy Bazak', 'Jonathan M Fahey', 'Katarzyna Wawak', 'Witold Korytowski', 'Albert W Girotti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Nitric oxide-mediated resistance to photodynamic therapy in a human breast tumor xenograft model: Improved outcome with NOS2 inhibitors.', 'Accelerated migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells after a photodynamic therapy-like challenge: Role of nitric oxide.', 'Multiple Means by Which Nitric Oxide can Antagonize Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Cytoprotective signaling associated with nitric oxide upregulation in tumor cells subjected to photodynamic therapy-like oxidative stress.', 'Upregulation of nitric oxide in tumor cells as a negative adaptation to photodynamic therapy.', 'Pro-Tumor Activity of Endogenous Nitric Oxide in Anti-Tumor Photodynamic Therapy: Recently Recognized Bystander Effects.', 'Understanding the Photodynamic Therapy Induced Bystander and Abscopal Effects: A Review.', 'The Negative Impact of Cancer Cell Nitric Oxide on Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Application of Monolayer Cell Cultures for Investigating Basic Mechanisms of Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Photodynamic Therapy as an Oxidative Anti-Tumor Modality: Negative Effects of Nitric Oxide on Treatment Efficacy.']"""

Aim and methods:   We used data from RIETE (international registry of patients with venous thromboembolism) to compare the clinical venous thromboembolism-related outcomes during the course of anticoagulation in patients with one of the 4 more frequent cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer).  Results:   As of September 2014, 3947 cancer patients were recruited, of whom 938 had breast, 629 prostate, 1189 colorectal, and 1191 lung cancer. Overall, 55% had metastatic disease (42%, 36%, 53%, and 72%, respectively). During the course of anticoagulant therapy (mean duration, 139 days), the rate of thromboembolic recurrences was similar to the rate of major bleeding in patients with breast (5.6 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8-8.1] vs 4.1 [95% CI, 2.7-5.9] events per 100 patient-years) or colorectal cancer (10 [95% CI, 7.6-13] vs 12 [95% CI, 9.4-15] per 100 patient-years).

Patients and methods:   Overall, 11,192 T1 kidney cancer patients treated with surgery or observation in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database were assessed. A competing risk regression (CRR) model was fitted to predict CSM and OCM after surgery or observation.

Current activity to centralise specialist cancer surgical services in two areas of England provides an opportunity to study the planning, implementation and outcomes of such changes. London Cancer and Manchester Cancer are centralising specialist surgical pathways for prostate, bladder, renal, and oesophago-gastric cancers, so that these services are provided in fewer hospitals. The centralisations in London were implemented between November 2015 and April 2016, while implementation in Manchester is anticipated in 2017.  Methods/design:   This mixed methods evaluation will analyse stakeholder preferences for centralisations; it will use qualitative methods to analyse planning, implementation and sustainability of the centralisations ('how and why?'); and it will use a controlled before and after design to study the impact of centralisation on clinical processes, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness and patient experience ('what works and at what cost?'). The study will use a framework developed in previous research on major system change in acute stroke services. A discrete choice experiment will examine patient, public and professional preferences for centralisations of this kind. Qualitative methods will include documentary analysis, stakeholder interviews and non-participant observations of meetings. Quantitative methods will include analysis of local and national data on clinical processes, outcomes, costs and National Cancer Patient Experience Survey data. Finally, we will hold a workshop for those involved in centralisations of specialist services in other settings to discuss how these lessons might apply more widely.  Discussion:   This multi-site study will address gaps in the evidence on stakeholder preferences for centralisations of specialist cancer surgery and the processes, impact and cost-effectiveness of changes of this kind. With increasing drives to centralise specialist services, lessons from this study will be of value to those who commission, organise and manage cancer services, as well as services for other conditions and in other settings. The study will face challenges in terms of recruitment, the retrospective analysis of some of the changes, the distinction between primary and secondary outcome measures, and obtaining information on the resources spent on the reconfiguration.""","""['Naomi J Fulop', 'Angus I G Ramsay', 'Cecilia Vindrola-Padros', 'Michael Aitchison', 'Ruth J Boaden', 'Veronica Brinton', 'Caroline S Clarke', 'John Hines', 'Rachael M Hunter', 'Claire Levermore', 'Satish B Maddineni', 'Mariya Melnychuk', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Muntzer M Mughal', 'Catherine Perry', 'Kathy Pritchard-Jones', 'David C Shackley', 'Jonathan Vickers', 'Stephen Morris']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Implement Sci""","""['Centralising specialist cancer surgery services in England: survey of factors that matter to patients and carers and health professionals.', 'Evaluation of reconfigurations of acute stroke services in different regions of England and lessons for implementation: a mixed-methods study.', 'Innovations in major system reconfiguration in England: a study of the effectiveness, acceptability and processes of implementation of two models of stroke care.', 'How to Cost the Implementation of Major System Change for Economic Evaluations: Case Study Using Reconfigurations of Specialist Cancer Surgery in Part of London, England.', 'Evaluating specialist autism teams’ provision of care and support for autistic adults without learning disabilities: the SHAPE mixed-methods study.', 'Current Trends in Volume and Surgical Outcomes in Gastric Cancer.', 'Optimising Exome Prenatal Sequencing Services (EXPRESS): a study protocol to evaluate rapid prenatal exome sequencing in the NHS Genomic Medicine Service version 2; peer review: 2 approved.', 'Cost-Utility Analysis of Major System Change in Specialist Cancer Surgery in London, England, Using Linked Patient-Level Electronic Health Records and Difference-in-Differences Analysis.', 'Loss associated with subtractive health service change: The case of specialist cancer centralization in England.', '""Attending to History"" in Major System Change in Healthcare in England: Specialist Cancer Surgery Service Reconfiguration.']"""

We combined video-based motion capture and ground reaction force data with computerized musculoskeletal modelling to assess the following primary outcomes: (i) peak joint torques at the hip, knee and ankle, and corresponding individual muscle forces; (ii) individual muscle contributions to acceleration of the body's centre of mass; and (iii) walking speed, stride length, and step width. A linear mixed model was used to compare mean differences between groups.  Results:   Compared with controls over 12 months, men receiving ADT had a mean reduction in total testosterone level from 14.1 to 0.4 nmol/L, and demonstrated more marked decreases in peak hip flexor torque by 14% [mean difference -0.11 N/kg (-0.19, -0.03), P = 0.01] and peak knee extensor torque by 16% [-0.11 N/kg (-0.20, -0.02), P = 0.02] of the initial mean value. Correspondingly, iliopsoas force decreased by 14% (P = 0.006), and quadriceps force decreased by 11%, although this narrowly missed statistical significance (P = 0.07). Soleus decreased contribution to forward acceleration of the body's centre of mass by 17% [mean difference -0.17 m/s2 (-0.29, -0.05), P < 0.01]. No significant changes between groups were observed in other joint torques or individual muscle contributions to acceleration of the body. Step width increased by 18% [mean adjusted difference 1.4 cm (0.6, 27.4), P = 0.042] in the ADT group compared with controls, with no change in stride length or walking speed.  Conclusions:   Testosterone deprivation selectively decreases lower-limb muscle function, predominantly affecting muscles that support body weight, accelerate the body forwards during walking, and mediate balance. Future exercise and pro-myogenic interventional studies to mitigate ADT-associated sarcopenia should target these deficits.""","""['Ada S Cheung', 'Hans Gray', 'Anthony G Schache', 'Rudolf Hoermann', 'Daryl Lim Joon', 'Jeffrey D Zajac', 'Marcus G Pandy', 'Mathis Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle""","""['Biomechanical Leg Muscle Function During Stair Ambulation in Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Selective Loss of Levator Ani and Leg Muscle Volumes in Men Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Contributions to the understanding of gait control.', 'Does Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Men with Prostate Cancer Increase the Risk of Sarcopenia?', 'Targeting muscle signaling pathways to minimize adverse effects of androgen deprivation.', 'Lifestyle aspects in a contemporary middle-European cohort of patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer: data from the non-interventional LEAN study.', 'Surgical Tolerability and Frailty in Elderly Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.', 'Dietary interventions to improve body composition in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a solution for the growing problem?', 'Marker Placement Reliability and Objectivity for Biomechanical Cohort Study: Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment (HAIE-Program 4).', 'The Adverse Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer and the Benefits and Potential Anti-oncogenic Mechanisms of Progressive Resistance Training.']"""

CTCs that originate from the same primary tumor can have heterogeneous phenotypes and, while some CTCs possess benign properties, others have high metastatic potential. Deconstructing the heterogeneity of CTCs is challenging and new methods are needed that can sort small numbers of cancer cells according to their phenotypic properties. Here we describe a new microfluidic approach that profiles, along two independent phenotypic axes, the behavior of heterogeneous cell subpopulations. Cancer cells are first profiled according to expression of a surface marker using a nanoparticle-enabled approach. Along the second dimension, these subsets are further separated into subpopulations corresponding to migration profiles generated in response to a chemotactic agent. We deploy this new technique and find a strong correlation between the surface expression and migration potential of CTCs present in blood from mice with xenografted tumors.

A simple adaptation to RC3 was performed and externally validated in a cohort of 2214 Chinese men from another Hong Kong hospital. The performance of the models were presented in calibration plots, area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and decision curve analyses.  Results:   PCa and HGPCa was diagnosed in 16.7% (503/3006) and 7.8% (234/3006) men in the development cohort, and 20.2% (447/2204) and 9.7% (214/2204) men in the validation cohort, respectively. The AUCs using the original RC3 model in the development cohort were 0.75 and 0.84 for PCa and HGPCa, respectively, but the calibration plots showed considerable overestimation. In the external validation of the recalibrated RC3 model, excellent calibration was observed, and discrimination was good with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.85 for PCa and HGPCa, respectively. Decision curve analyses in the validation cohort showed net clinical benefit of the recalibrated RC3 model over PSA.

Here we define diverse AR genomic structural rearrangements (AR-GSRs) as a class of molecular alterations occurring in one third of CRPC-stage tumours. AR-GSRs occur in the context of copy-neutral and amplified AR and display heterogeneity in breakpoint location, rearrangement class and sub-clonal enrichment in tumours within and between patients. Despite this heterogeneity, one common outcome in tumours with high sub-clonal enrichment of AR-GSRs is outlier expression of diverse AR variant species lacking the ligand-binding domain and possessing ligand-independent transcriptional activity.

Surgery remains one of the front-line treatment options for NSCLC, but events within the perioperative period were found to affect cancer prognosis, such as anesthesia procedures. Isoflurane, a commonly used volatile anesthetic, enhances the malignant potential of renal, prostate, and ovarian cancer cells, but its effects on NSCLC development have not been previously reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS CCK-8 and MTT cell proliferation assays were used to analyze NSCLC cell proliferation. Metastatic ability was examined by wound healing and transwell assays. We used Western blot analysis to study the mechanism of effect of Isoflurane in NSCLC development. RESULTS We demonstrated that isoflurane promotes proliferation, migration and invasiveness of NSCLC cells, as well as upregulation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt-mTOR signaling abolished the ability of isoflurane to promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells, indicating that isoflurane promotes NSCLC cell malignancy by activating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

Use of text messages is an innovative method to provide health information to reduce these risks. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a text messaging intervention to reduce CVD and cancer risk factors in African-Americans.  Design:   We developed an intervention using text messages culturally tailored for African-Americans over age 50 who were at risk (one or more modifiable risk factors) for CVD and/or cancer. Sociodemographic data, biologic measures, cancer screening practices, and general health status were assessed. Group interviews were conducted to assess feasibility and acceptability.  Results:   Participants were primarily female (69%), aged 58 ± 5 years, who were married (59%) and worked full time (56%). In terms of feasibility and acceptability, themes of encouragement through text messages received and a desire for a longer study period emerged from group interviews with participants. Participants experienced significant decreases in waist circumference (41 ± 5 vs 40 ± 5, p = .002), systolic blood pressure (147 ± 25 mmHg vs 138 ± 20 mmHg, p = .009), diastolic blood pressure (87 ± 16 mmHg vs 82 ± 10 mmHg, p = .02), total cholesterol (194 ± 35 mg/dL vs 173 ± 32 mg/dL, p < .001), and low-density lipoprotein levels (100 ± 32 mg/dL vs 86 ± 29 mg/dL, p = .015).

However, at the same concentrations, 9-AAA had no effect on the growth and apoptosis of normal human skin fibroblasts (HSFs).

Visible effects on the cell growth and survival of tumor cell lines were observed after 24-48 h of treatment with 9-AAA, and increased over time. The inhibition of cancer cell growth was found to be due to the gradually increasing number of cells dying by apoptosis, which was observed using two methods, direct counting and FlowSight analysis. Simultaneously, cell motile activity decreased to the same degree in cancer and normal cells within the first 8 h of incubation in the presence of 9-AAA.

The GNPs were synthesized with 15 nm in diameter and 0.1 mM (0.0197 mg/ml) in concentration by using a chemical reduction method. Then, the MAGIC-f gel was synthesized. The fabricated gel was poured into the tubes located at the prostate (with and without the GNPs) locations of the phantom. The phantom was irradiated with 192Ir brachytherapy sources for prostate cancer. After 24 hours, the irradiated gels was read by using Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. Following the brachytherapy practices, the absolute doses at the reference points and isodose curves were extracted and compared by experimental measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.  Results:   The mean absorbed doses in the presence of the GNPs in prostate were 14% higher than the corresponding values without the GNPs in the brachytherapy.

CCP-score is a well-validated prognostic assay predictive of PCa death, biochemical recurrence, and progression.  Methods:   We evaluated CCP-score at biopsy in 52 patients newly diagnosed with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. CCP-score was calculated as average RNA expression of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeping genes. The predictive ability of CCP-score was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses, and compared to that of Ki-67 levels and traditional clinical variables including prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, stage, and percentage of positive cores at biopsy.  Results:   In spite of an overall good accuracy in attributing the correct risk class, 7 high-risk and 13 intermediate-risk patients were misclassified by the Prolaris test. On analysis of variance, mean CCP-score significantly differed across different risk classes based on pathologic results (-1.2 in low risk, -0.444 in intermediate risk, 0.208 in high risk). CCP-score was a significant predictor of high-risk PCa both on univariate and multivariate analyses, after adjusting for clinical variables. Combining CCP-score and the European Association of Urology clinical risk assessment improved the accuracy of risk attribution by around 10%, up to 87.8%. CCP-score was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence, but only on univariate analysis.  Conclusion:   The CCP-score might provide important new information to risk assessment of newly diagnosed PCa in addition to traditional clinical variables. A correct risk attribution is essential to tailor the best treatment for each patient.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Gabriele Cozzi', 'Lorenzo Daniele', 'Anna Sapino', 'Stefania Munegato', 'Giuseppe Renne', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Validation of a cell-cycle progression gene panel to improve risk stratification in a contemporary prostatectomy cohort.', 'Prognostic value of a cell-cycle progression score in men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance after MRI-guided prostate biopsy--a pilot study.', 'Prognostic value of an RNA expression signature derived from cell cycle proliferation genes in patients with prostate cancer: a retrospective study.', 'Prognostic Value of the Cell Cycle Progression Score in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Optimal Use of Tumor-Based Molecular Assays for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Case Study of Noni Extract in Men with Very Low-Risk or Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Effective Prediction of Prostate Cancer Recurrence through the IQGAP1 Network.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (Review).']"""

The salvage treatment decision is usually made dynamically based on the patient's evolving history of disease status and other time-dependent clinical covariates. A multi-center prostate cancer observational study has provided us data on longitudinal prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, time-varying salvage treatment, and cancer recurrence time. These data enable us to estimate the best dynamic regime of salvage treatment, while accounting for the complicated confounding of time-varying covariates present in the data. A Random Forest based method is used to model the probability of regime adherence and inverse probability weights are used to account for the complexity of selection bias in regime adherence. The optimal regime is then identified by the largest restricted mean survival time. We conduct simulation studies with different PSA trends to mimic both simple and complex regime adherence mechanisms. The proposed method can efficiently accommodate complex and possibly unknown adherence mechanisms, and it is robust to cases where the proportional hazards assumption is violated.

Genomic studies implicate this locus in the initiation of clinically significant PCa and with progression to metastatic disease. However, the genes within this region have not been fully characterized to date. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a microRNA component of this region-miR-383-is frequently downregulated in prostate cancer, has a critical role in determining tumor-initiating potential and is involved in prostate cancer metastasis via direct regulation of CD44, a ubiquitous marker of PCa tumor-initiating cells (TICs)/stem cells. Expression analyses of miR-383 in PCa clinical tissues established that low miR-383 expression is associated with poor prognosis. Functional data suggest that miR-383 regulates PCa tumor-initiating/stem-like cells via CD44 regulation. Ectopic expression of miR-383 inhibited tumor-initiating capacity of CD44+ PCa cells. Also, 'anti-metastatic' effects of ectopic miR-383 expression were observed in a PCa experimental metastasis model. In view of our results, we propose that frequent loss of miR-383 at chr8p22 region leads to tumor initiation and prostate cancer metastasis. Thus, we have identified a novel finding that associates a long observed genomic alteration to PCa stemness and metastasis. Our data suggest that restoration of miR-383 expression may be an effective therapeutic modality against PCa.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of PSMA PET/CT in the diagnosis of recurrent PCa with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Patients and methods:   We carried out a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT from November 2013 to December 2014 in our department. Among these patients, 50 out of 178 who had increasing PSA levels (<5 ng/ml) and did not have known metastasis were included in this study.  Results:   Patients had an average PSA of 1.41 ng/ml. A total of 29 patients (58%) showed at least one positive lesion. PET positivity rates of 31% (n=4), 54% (n=13), and 88% (n=14) were observed in patients with a PSA level of less than 0.2, 0.2-2, and 2-5 ng/ml, respectively. A positive correlation was observed between positivity rate and Gleason scores and blood PSA levels. Verification was performed in 46 patients, with biopsy (n=3) and follow-up, and conventional imaging studies at the time of the PET/CT or during follow-up with a mean period of 10.6±3.3 months and ranged from 3.8 to 16.4 months. According to patient-based analysis of 46 cases, 57% of patients had true positive, 24% of patients had true negative, 2% of patients had false positive, an 18% of patients had false-negative findings. A sensitivity of 76.47% (95% confidence interval: 58.83-89.25%) and a specificity of 91.67% (95% confidence interval: 61.52-99.79%) were found.  Conclusion:   PET/CT with Ga-PSMA is a valuable tool for assessing recurrence of PCa with a high sensitivity in patients who have PSA levels between 0.2 and 5 ng/ml.

It is also being examined clinically in patients with breast and lung carcinoma and patients with multiple myeloma. As with other forms of radiation, the aim of 223Ra is to reduce tumor burden by directly killing tumor cells. External beam (photon) and proton radiation have been shown to augment tumor sensitivity to antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, little is known about whether treatment with 223Ra can also induce such immunogenic modulation in tumor cells that survive irradiation. We examined these effects in vitro by exposing human prostate, breast, and lung carcinoma cells to sublethal doses of 223Ra. 223Ra significantly enhanced T cell-mediated lysis of each tumor type by CD8+ CTLs specific for MUC-1, brachyury, and CEA tumor antigens. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the increase in CTL killing was accompanied by augmented protein expression of MHC-I and calreticulin in each tumor type, molecules that are essential for efficient antigen presentation. Enhanced tumor-cell lysis was facilitated by calreticulin surface translocation following 223Ra exposure. The phenotypic changes observed after treatment appear to be mediated by induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway. By rendering tumor cells more susceptible to T cell-mediated lysis, 223Ra may potentially be effective in combination with various immunotherapies, particularly cancer vaccines that are designed to generate and expand patients' endogenous antigen-specific T-cell populations against specific tumor antigens.""","""['Anthony S Malamas', 'Sofia R Gameiro', 'Karin M Knudson', 'James W Hodge']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Radiation-induced immunogenic modulation of tumor enhances antigen processing and calreticulin exposure, resulting in enhanced T-cell killing.', 'Chemotherapy-induced immunogenic modulation of tumor cells enhances killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and is distinct from immunogenic cell death.', 'Tumor Cells Surviving Exposure to Proton or Photon Radiation Share a Common Immunogenic Modulation Signature, Rendering Them More Sensitive to T Cell-Mediated Killing.', 'High-linear energy transfer irradiation targeted to skeletal metastases by the alpha-emitter 223Ra: adjuvant or alternative to conventional modalities?', 'Applications of 211At and 223Ra in targeted alpha-particle radiotherapy.', 'Targeted thorium-227 conjugates as treatment options in oncology.', 'Developments in Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapies and Immunotherapies for Cancer Treatment.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals heat anti-tumor immunity.', 'Dying of Stress: Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Small-Molecule Inhibitors in Immunogenic Cell Death and Immunogenic Modulation.', 'Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Treatment.']"""

However exposure of ALAN as an environmental risk factor and its relation to cancers in humans has never been studied in detail. Objective: To explore the association of ALAN with all forms of cancers in 158 countries. Materials and Methods: An ecological study encompassing global data was conducted from January to June 2015, with age-standardized rates (ASR) of cancers as the outcome measure. ALAN, in the protected areas, as the exposure variable, was measured with reference to the Protected Area Light Pollution Indicator (PALI) and the Protected Area Human Influence Indicator (PAHI). Pearson’s correlations were calculated for PALI and PAHI with ASR of cancers for 158 countries, adjusted for country populations, electricity consumption, air pollution, and total area covered by forest. Stratified analysis was conducted according to the country income levels. Linear regression was applied to measure the variation in cancers explained by PALI and PAHI. Results: PALI and PAHI were positively associated with ASR of all forms of cancer, and also the four most common cancers (p < 0.05). These positive correlations remained statistically significant for PAHI with all forms of cancer, lung, breast, and colorectal cancer after adjusting for confounders. Positive associations of PALI and PAHI with cancers varied with income level of the individual countries. Variation in all forms of cancers, and the four most common cancers explained by PALI and PAHI, ranged from 3.3 – 35.5%.

Therefore, this study examined the association between depression treatment and healthcare expenditures among elderly with depression and incident cancer.  Methods:   The current study used a retrospective longitudinal study design, the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database.

The adjusted associations between depression treatment and healthcare expenditures were analyzed with generalized linear mixed model regressions with gamma distribution and log link after controlling for other factors.  Results:   The average 1-year total healthcare expenditures after depression diagnosis were $38 219 for those who did not receive depression treatment; $42 090 for those treated with antidepressants only; $46 913 for those treated with psychotherapy only; and $51 008 for those treated with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy.

Model updating may improve predictions. Previously suggested methods vary in their extensiveness of updating the model. We aim to define a strategy in selecting an appropriate update method that considers the balance between the amount of evidence for updating in the new patient sample and the danger of overfitting. We consider recalibration in the large (re-estimation of model intercept); recalibration (re-estimation of intercept and slope) and model revision (re-estimation of all coefficients) as update methods. We propose a closed testing procedure that allows the extensiveness of the updating to increase progressively from a minimum (the original model) to a maximum (a completely revised model). The procedure involves multiple testing with maintaining approximately the chosen type I error rate. We illustrate this approach with three clinical examples: patients with prostate cancer, traumatic brain injury and children presenting with fever. The need for updating the prostate cancer model was completely driven by a different model intercept in the update sample (adjustment: 2.58). Separate testing of model revision against the original model showed statistically significant results, but led to overfitting (calibration slope at internal validation = 0.86).

We conclude that the proposed closed testing procedure may be useful in selecting appropriate update methods for previously developed prediction models.

A recent theory focuses on the role Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) in driving tumorigenesis and disease progression. This theory hypothesizes that a population of the tumor cell with similar functional and phenotypic characteristics as normal tissue stem cells are responsible for formation and advancement of many human cancers. The CSCs subpopulation can differentiate into non-CSC tumor cells and promote phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within the tumor. The presence of CSCs has been reported in a number of human cancers including blood, breast, brain, colon, lung, pancreas prostate and liver. Although the origin of CSCs remains a mystery, recent reports suggest that the phenotypic characteristics of CSCs may be plastic and are influenced by the microenvironment specific for the individual tumor. Such factors unique to each tumor preserve the dynamic balance between CSCs to non-CSCs cell fate, as well as maintain the proper equilibrium. Alternating such equilibrium via dedifferentiation can result in aggressiveness, as CSCs are considered to be more resistant to the conventional cancer treatments of chemotherapy and radiation. Understanding how the tumoral microenvironment affects the plasticity driven CSC niche will be critical for developing a more effective treatment for cancer by eliminating its aggressive and recurring nature that now is believed to be perpetuated by CSCs.""","""['Gina Lee', 'Robert R Hall rd', 'Atique U Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Dissecting Tumor Growth: The Role of Cancer Stem Cells in Drug Resistance and Recurrence.', 'An alginate-based platform for cancer stem cell research.', 'Plasticity of Cancer Stem Cell: Origin and Role in Disease Progression and Therapy Resistance.', 'Cancer Stem Cell Metabolism and Potential Therapeutic Targets.', 'Pancreatic cancer stem cells: A state or an entity?', 'The landscape of exosomal non-coding RNAs in breast cancer drug resistance, focusing on underlying molecular mechanisms.', 'Advancements in Polymeric Nanocarriers to Mediate Targeted Therapy against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Mining Transcriptomic Data to Uncover the Association between CBX Family Members and Cancer Stemness.', 'Asymmetric Cell Division and Tumor Heterogeneity.', 'Chelerythrine Chloride Inhibits Stemness of Melanoma Cancer Stem-Like Cells (CSCs) Potentially via Inducing Reactive Oxygen Species and Causing Mitochondria Dysfunction.']"""

In this context, we recently reported on the levels of preexisting immunity in prostate cancer patients vaccinated with the HER-2 hybrid peptide (AE37), during a phase I clinical trial. The purpose of the current study was to correlate between preexisting immunity to the native HER-2 peptide, AE36, and expression of HLA-A2 and -A24 molecules with the clinical outcome. Additionally, we investigated the ability of the AE37 vaccine to induce an antitumor immune response against other tumor associated antigens, not integrated in the vaccine formulation, with respect to the clinical response.  Methods:   We analyzed prostate cancer patients who were vaccinated with the AE37 vaccine [Ii-Key-HER-2/neu(776-790) hybrid peptide vaccine (AE37), which is a MHC class II long peptide vaccine encompassing MHC class I epitopes, during a phase I clinical trial. Preexisting immunity to the native HER-2/neu(776-790) (AE36) peptide was assessed by IFNγ response or dermal reaction at the inoculation site. Antigen specificity against other tumor antigens was defined using multimer analysis. Progression free survival (PFS) was considered as the patients' clinical outcome. Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test at 95 % confidence interval was used for statistical evaluation at different time points and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test were used for the evaluation of PFS.  Results:   Preexisting immunity to AE36, irrespectively of HLA expression, was correlated with longer PFS. Specific CD8+ T cell immunity against E75 and PSA146-151 (HLA-A2 restricted), as well as, PSA153-161 (HLA-A24 restricted) was detected at relatively high frequencies which were further enhanced during vaccinations. Specific immunity against PSA153-161 correlated with longer PFS in HLA-A24+ patients. However, HLA-A2+ patients with high preexisting or vaccine-induced immunity to E75, showed a trend for shorter PFS.  Conclusions:   Our data cast doubt on whether preexisting immunity or epitope spreading specific for HLA-class I-restricted peptides can actually predict a favorable clinical outcome. They also impose that preexisting immunity to long vaccine peptides, encompassing both HLA class II and I epitopes should be considered as an important prerequisite for the improvement of future immunotherapeutic protocols.

Those without body mass index (BMI) or comorbidity information were excluded. BMI was treated as a categorical variable according to the World Health Organization classification. Demographic and comorbid conditions were compared between BMI groups, and multivariable logistical regression was used to identify independent predictors of adverse perioperative events.  Results:   We identified 17,693 MIP and 4674 ORP for analysis. Of the entire cohort, only 18.7% had a BMI within the normal range (18.5-24.9), whereas the remaining 81.3% were at least overweight (BMI > 25). Class I, II, and III obesity accounted for 25.0%, 7.0%, and 2.3% of the cohort, respectively. Overall, complications were higher with ORP (19.0%) than with MIP (5.3%), which held true across all BMI categories. The rate of wound, renal, thromboembolic, infectious, neurologic, Clavien grade III-V, and overall complications among MIP were directly related to BMI. Only wound and renal complications were related to BMI in ORP. In multivariable analysis, obesity was found to be an independent predictor of wound, renal, and thromboembolic complications.

Methods:   A program was developed, based on a specific database, to manage treatment interruptions. Benefits of the program were analyzed in reference to previously published data. Analysis was also performed of two measures to reduce OTT prolongation and improve treatment outcomes: working on public holidays and conducting treatment unit maintenance on Saturdays.  Results:   The study included 2352 patients.

There is no evidence in literature demonstrating its impact on radical prostatectomy.  Objectives:   To evaluate the impact of the number of TRUS core biopsies in the surgical morbidity and rate of positive margin on robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Material and methods:   A prospectively maintained database of 2,054 RARPs in a single institution. Patients were further grouped into 2 groups based on the number of TRUS biopsy cores (G1≤12 cores; G2>12 cores). Multivariable logistic regression model was applied to analyze the impact of number of cores on complications.  Results:   A total number of 1,042 patients in the group 1 (≤12 cores) and 1,012 patients in the group 2 (>12 cores) were included. The rate of perioperative complications increased with higher number of biopsies (G1 6.4 vs. G2 8.5%; P=.03), but high grade complication (Clavien 3-4) were similar (G1 1.4 vs. G2 2.2%; P=.16). Positive surgical margin rates were similar in both groups (G1 11.8 vs. 9.98%; P=.2). At the multivariable logistic regression analysis shown that G2 had a 39% (OR 0.645) higher rate to experience perioperative complications during RARP.  Conclusion:   Higher number of TRUS biopsy cores (>12) is associated to higher blood loss and perioperative complications during RARP. Careful preoperative evaluation for those patients underwent multiple biopsies or saturation protocols is mandatory. Application of longer intervals (>6 weeks) between biopsy and surgery may be advisable to minimize potential risks of surgical complications in patients may benefit from RARP.

It has shown meaningful anti-tumor activity with a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in phase I and II studies; however, the efficacy of currently approved CRPC therapies after treatment with galeterone is unknown. In this study, we evaluate prostate specific antigen (PSA) response of non-protocol therapies following galeterone in a subset of patients treated on the Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response (ARMOR) 2 study.  Patients and methods:   Patients who received any subsequent treatment were included. PSA response and treatment duration were summarized by line and type of subsequent therapy.  Results:   Overall, 27 of 40 patients received ≥ 1 post-galeterone treatment, of whom 18 (67%) discontinued galeterone for progression, 14 (52%) received ≥ 2 treatments, and 6 (22%) received ≥ 3 treatments. PSA changed by a median of -36%, -35%, and +60% in patients receiving first-line, second-line, and third-line therapy, respectively. Overall, 18 (67%) received subsequent enzalutamide, 12 (44%) received docetaxel, 9 (33%) received abiraterone, and 5 (19%) received cabazitaxel. PSA changed by a median of -27%, -34%, -39%, and 17% for patients receiving subsequent enzalutamide, docetaxel, abiraterone, and cabazitaxel, respectively, at any line.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate that CRPC therapies exhibit differential anti-tumor activity following galeterone. In this small cohort, abiraterone demonstrates the highest PSA response post-galeterone, whereas enzalutamide and chemotherapy have more modest activity. Larger clinical studies are warranted to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-generation hormonal agents and chemotherapy post-galeterone.

This confers a risk of reverse causation bias in studies of cancer risk associated with drug use, as early symptoms of a yet undiagnosed cancer might lead to drug treatment in the period leading up to the diagnosis. This bias can be alleviated by disregarding exposure for some time before the cancer diagnosis (lag time). We aimed at assessing the duration of lag time needed to avoid reverse causation bias.  Methods:   We identified all Danish patients with incident cancer between 2000 and 2012 (n = 353 087). Incident use of prescription drugs was assessed prior to their cancer diagnosis as well as among population controls (n = 1 402 400). Analyses were conducted for all cancers and for breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer individually. Further, analyses were performed for a composite measure of all incident drug use as well as for nine pre-specified individual drug classes, representing drug treatment likely to be prescribed for symptoms of the given cancers.  Results:   The incidence rate for new drug treatment among cancer cases was stable around 130 per 1000 persons per month until 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis where it increased gradually and peaked at 434 in the month immediately preceding the cancer diagnosis. Considerable variation was observed among cancers, for example, breast cancer showed almost no such effect. The pre-selected drug classes showed a stronger increase prior to cancer diagnoses than drugs overall.  Conclusions:   Incident use of drugs increases in the months prior to a cancer diagnosis. To avoid reverse causation, 6 months' lag time would be sufficient for most drug-cancer associations. © 2016 The Authors.

However, prostate biopsy underestimates final pathology in about one-third of patients. We evaluated the final whole gland pathology from radical prostatectomy exclusively in order to assess the true risk of progressing to the mCRPC state for patients with confirmed Gleason ≤6 prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients with confirmed mCRPC from our outpatient clinic were retrospectively evaluated with regard to whole gland pathology and the occurrence of Gleason 6 histology from 1995 to 2015. Conversely, patients with confirmed Gleason 6 pathology from our institutional database were followed up for the development of mCRPC from 2001 to 2015. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test were applied for survival analysis. The binomial test was used to evaluate occurrence rates of Gleason ≤6 pathologies in mCRPC patients.  Results:   Out of 62 patients with mCRPC none had confirmed Gleason 6 pathology on whole gland histology of the prostate. Out of 86 patients with confirmed Gleason 6 pathology none developed an mCRPC over the follow-up period.

The current guidelines recommend extended pelvic lymph node dissection (e-PLND) for selected intermediate- and high-risk patients treated with RP. However, the indications, optimal extent, and therapeutic benefits of e-PLND remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether e-PLND confers an oncological benefit for high-risk Pca compared to neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and estramustine (LHRH + EMP). The Michinoku Urological Cancer Study Group database contained the data of 2403 consecutive Pca patients treated with RP at four institutes between March 2000 and December 2014. In the e-PLND group, we identified 238 high-risk Pca patients who underwent RP and e-PLND, with lymphatic tissue removal around the obturator and the external iliac regions, and hypogastric lymph node dissection. The neoadjuvant therapy with limited PLND (l-PLND) group included 280 high-risk Pca patients who underwent RP and removal of the obturator node chain between September 2005 and June 2014 at Hirosaki University. The outcome measure was BRFS. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates for the neoadjuvant therapy with l-PLND group and e-PLND group were 84.9 and 54.7%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The operative time was significantly longer in the e-PLND group compared to that of the neoadjuvant therapy with l-PLND group.

However, 68Ga has several shortcomings as a radiolabel including short half-life and non-ideal energies, and this has motivated consideration of 18F-labelled analogs. 18F-PSMA-1007 was selected among several 18F-PSMA-ligand candidate compounds because it demonstrated high labelling yields, outstanding tumor uptake and fast, non-urinary background clearance. Here, we describe the properties of 18F-PSMA-1007 in human volunteers and patients.  Methods:   Radiation dosimetry of 18F-PSMA-1007 was determined in three healthy volunteers who underwent whole-body PET-scans and concomitant blood and urine sampling. Following this, ten patients with high-risk prostate cancer underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT (1 h and 3 h p.i.) and normal organ biodistribution and tumor uptakes were examined. Eight patients underwent prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Uptake in intra-prostatic lesions and lymph node metastases were correlated with final histopathology, including PSMA immunostaining.  Results:   With an effective dose of approximately 4.4-5.5 mSv per 200-250 MBq examination, 18F-PSMA-1007 behaves similar to other PSMA-PET agents as well as to other 18F-labelled PET-tracers. In comparison to other PSMA-targeting PET-tracers, 18F-PSMA-1007 has reduced urinary clearance enabling excellent assessment of the prostate. Similar to 18F-DCFPyL and with slightly slower clearance kinetics than PSMA-11, favorable tumor-to-background ratios are observed 2-3 h after injection. In eight patients, diagnostic findings were successfully validated by histopathology. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT detected 18 of 19 lymph node metastases in the pelvis, including nodes as small as 1 mm in diameter.  Conclusion: 18F-PSMA-1007 performs at least comparably to 68Ga-PSMA-11, but its longer half-life combined with its superior energy characteristics and non-urinary excretion overcomes some practical limitations of 68Ga-labelled PSMA-targeted tracers.""","""['Frederik L Giesel', 'B Hadaschik', 'J Cardinale', 'J Radtke', 'M Vinsensia', 'W Lehnert', 'C Kesch', 'Y Tolstov', 'S Singer', 'N Grabe', 'S Duensing', 'M Schäfer', 'O C Neels', 'W Mier', 'U Haberkorn', 'K Kopka', 'C Kratochwil']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68GaGa-P16-093 as a PSMA-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceutical for Detection of Cancer: Initial Evaluation and Comparison with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting with Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Small Molecule, Multimodal, 18F-PET and Fluorescence Imaging Agent Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen: First-in-Human Study.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 18FF-choline and Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen, Using 18FDCFPyL PET/CT, in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Importance of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Salivary Gland Tumors.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT imaging 2\xa0h after injection of 18FPSMA-1007 can lead to higher staging of prostate cancer than imaging after 1\xa0h.']"""

Several in vitro studies have shown that tocotrienols have stronger anticancer effects than tocopherols. VCaP cell line used in this study is from a vertebral bone metastasis from a patient with prostate cancer. Eight-week-old male NCr(-/-) nude mice were subcutaneously injected with VCaP-luc cells in matrigel and then administered a tocotrienol mixture for 8 weeks. The tocotrienol mixture inhibited the growth of human prostate tumor xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations of tocotrienols and their metabolites were significantly increased in treatment groups. Tocotrienols inhibited prostate tumor growth by suppressing cell proliferation, which was associated with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27. In addition, tocotrienol treatment was associated with elevated H3K9 acetylation levels at proximal promoter regions of p21 and p27 and with decreased expression of histone deacetylases. Tocotrienols inhibited human prostate tumor growth, associated with up-regulation of the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27.

The ERSPC has shown a significant 21% reduction in PrCa mortality at 13 years of follow-up. The effect of screening appears to vary across centres, for which several explanations are possible. We set to assess if the apparent differences in PrCa mortality reduction between the centres can be explained by differences in screening protocols.  Methods:   We examined the centre differences by developing a simulation model and estimated how alternative screening protocols would have affected PrCa mortality.  Results:   Our results showed outcomes similar to those observed, when the results by centres were reproduced by simulating the screening regimens with PSA threshold of 3 versus 4ng/ml, or screening interval of two versus four years. The findings suggest that the differences are only marginally attributable to the different screening protocols.

Components of the cell cytoskeleton are therapeutic targets in cancer. βIV-tubulin is one such component that has two isotypes-βIVa and βIVb. βIVa and βIVb isotypes only differ in two amino acids at their C-terminus. Studies have implicated βIVa-tubulin or βIVb-tubulin expression with chemoresistance in prostate, breast, ovarian and lung cancer. However, no studies have examined the role of βIV-tubulin in PC or attempted to identify isotype specific roles in regulating cancer cell growth and chemosensitivity. We aimed to determine the role of βIVa- or βIVb-tubulin on PC growth and chemosensitivity. PC cells (MiaPaCa-2, HPAF-II, AsPC1) were treated with siRNA (control, βIVa-tubulin or βIVb-tubulin). The ability of PC cells to form colonies in the presence or absence of chemotherapy was measured by clonogenic assays. Inhibition of βIVa-tubulin in PC cells had no effect chemosensitivity. In contrast, inhibition of βIVb-tubulin in PC cells sensitized to vinca alkaloids (Vincristine, Vinorelbine and Vinblastine), which was accompanied by increased apoptosis and enhanced cell cycle arrest. We show for the first time that βIVb-tubulin, but not βIVa-tubulin, plays a role in regulating vinca alkaloid chemosensitivity in PC cells.

MT1-MMP is believed to be a central mediator of tumourigenesis whose role is dictated by its functionally distinct protein domains. Both the localization and signal transduction capabilities of MT1-MMP are dependent on its cytoplasmic domain, exemplifying diverse regulatory functions. To further our understanding of the multifunctional contributions of MT1-MMP to cellular processes, we overexpressed cytoplasmic domain altered constructs in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and analyzed migration and viability in 2D culture conditions, morphology in 3D Matrigel culture, and tumorigenic ability in vivo. We found that the cytoplasmic domain was not needed for MT1-MMP mediated migration promotion, but was necessary to maintain viability during serum depravation in 2D culture. Similarly, during 3D Matrigel culture the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was not needed to initiate a protrusive phenotype, but was necessary to prevent colony blebbing when cells were serum deprived. We also tested in vivo tumorigenic potential to show that cells expressing cytoplasmic domain altered constructs demonstrated a reduced ability to vascularize tumours.

This phenomenon is not observed in other cancers. We sought to determine if the target of warfarin, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), is expressed in benign and cancerous prostate tissues and if a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the VKOR gene is associated with prostate cancer risk.  Materials and methods:   The expression of VKOR was quantified by immunohistochemistry in an institutional series of 54 radical prostatectomy samples and metastatic biopsies, as well as in 40 other cancers and matched benign tissues on a tissue microarray. Genotyping of SNP rs2359612 was performed in a prospective series of 57 patients.  Results:   VKOR is highly expressed in benign human prostate epithelial cells but is not expressed or expressed at very low levels in cancerous cells. This expression pattern is unique to prostate cancer. Additionally, the proportion of the carrier C allele of rs2359612 in the patients with prostate cancer was significantly higher than in the population, suggesting an association between this allele and the risk of having a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The expression of VKOR in benign prostate epithelial cells, along with the association between a functional VKOR SNP and prostate cancer risk, suggests a possible role for VKOR in mediating the effect of warfarin on prostate cancer risk. Larger multi-institutional cohort studies are warranted, as are molecular studies on the role of VKOR in prostate cancer development.""","""['Ben Yi Tew', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Miaoling He', 'Tommy Tong', 'Huiqing Wu', 'JoAnn Hsu', 'Xueli Liu', 'Susan L Neuhausen', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Vitamin K epoxide reductase regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Evaluation of oral anticoagulants with vitamin K epoxide reductase in its native milieu.', 'Evaluation of warfarin resistance using transcription activator-like effector nucleases-mediated vitamin K epoxide reductase knockout HEK293 cells.', 'Structural and functional insights into human vitamin K epoxide reductase and vitamin K epoxide reductase-like1.', 'Structure and function of vitamin K epoxide reductase.', 'Is use of vitamin K antagonists associated with the risk of prostate cancer?: A meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the utility of a four kallikrein (4K) panel in predicting the presence of high-grade cancer in men on active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Plasma collected before the first and subsequent surveillance biopsies was assessed for 718 men prospectively enrolled in the multi-institutional Canary PASS trial. Biopsy data were split 2:1 into training and test sets. We developed statistical models that included clinical information and either the 4Kpanel or serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The endpoint was reclassification to Gleason ≥7. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and area under the curve (AUC) to assess discriminatory capacity, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to report clinical net benefit.  Results and limitations:   Significant predictors for reclassification were 4Kpanel (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-1.81) or PSA (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.53-2.91), ≥20% cores positive (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.33-3.32), two or more prior negative biopsies (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.85), prostate volume (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.70), and body mass index (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14). ROC curve analysis comparing 4K and base models indicated that the 4Kpanel improved accuracy for predicting reclassification (AUC 0.78 vs 0.74) at the first surveillance biopsy. Both models performed comparably for prediction of reclassification at subsequent biopsies (AUC 0.75 vs 0.76). In DCA, both models showed higher net benefit compared to biopsy-all and biopsy-none strategies. Limitations include the single cohort nature of the study and the small numbers; results should be validated in another cohort before clinical use.  Conclusions:   The 4Kpanel provided incremental value over routine clinical information in predicting high-grade cancer in the first biopsy after diagnosis. The 4Kpanel did not add predictive value to the base model at subsequent surveillance biopsies.  Patient summary:   Active surveillance is a management strategy for many low-grade prostate cancers. Repeat biopsies monitor for previously undetected high-grade cancer. We show that a model with clinical variables, including a panel of four kallikreins, indicates the presence of high-grade cancer before a biopsy is performed.""","""['Daniel W Lin', 'Lisa F Newcomb', 'Marshall D Brown', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Yan Dong', 'James D Brooks', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew Cooperberg', 'Atreya Dash', 'William J Ellis', 'Michael Fabrizio', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Andrew A Wagner', 'Yingye Zheng;Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Investigators']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Refined Analysis of Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics to Predict Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Outcomes.', 'Comparison Between the Four-kallikrein Panel and Prostate Health Index for Predicting Prostate Cancer.', 'Reducing unnecessary biopsies while detecting clinically significant prostate cancer including cribriform growth with the ERSPC Rotterdam risk calculator and 4Kscore.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

It has been correlated with increased cell survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Previous studies reported that nimbolide, a terpenoid derived from the leaves and flowers of neem tree inhibits cancer growth through selective modulation of cell signaling pathways linked to inflammation, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis.  Methods:   The present study aimed to examine the effect of nimbolide at 1 and 2μM concentrations on TNF-α/TNFR1 mediated signaling molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation in PC-3 cell line via NF-κB and MAPK pathways by real time PCR and western blot. Protein and compound interaction were performed by Molecular docking analysis.  Results:   Our results indicate that nimbolide treatment suppressed expression of TNF-α, SODD, Grb2, SOS mRNA and modulated TNF-α/TNFR1 regulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling molecules in PC-3 cells. Additional molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the stability of nimbolide and signaling molecules binding interactions. Binding pose analysis revealed the significance of hydrogen bond interactions for effective stabilization of virtual ligand protein complexes.  Conclusion:   Nimbolide inhibited prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation via NF-κB and MAPK pathways.""","""['P Raja Singh', 'E Sugantha Priya', 'S Balakrishnan', 'R Arunkumar', 'G Sharmila', 'M Rajalakshmi', 'J Arunakaran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Inhibition of cell survival and proliferation by nimbolide in human androgen-independent prostate cancer (PC-3) cells: involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing effect of nimbolide by altering molecules involved in apoptosis and IGF signalling via PI3K/Akt in prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line.', 'Nimbolide retards tumor cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis by downregulating MMP-2/9 expression via inhibiting ERK1/2 and reducing DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in colon cancer cells.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'Nimbolide, a Neem Limonoid, Is a Promising Candidate for the Anticancer Drug Arsenal.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Exploring the therapeutic potential of Neem (Azadirachta Indica) for the treatment of prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'Huangjia Ruangan Granule Inhibits Inflammation in a Rat Model with Liver Fibrosis by Regulating TNF/MAPK and NF-κB Signaling Pathways.', 'Nanodelivery and anticancer effect of a limonoid, nimbolide, in breast and pancreatic cancer cells.']"""
