We have here investigated the potential use of lipids in urinary exosomes as prostate cancer biomarkers.  Methods:   A high-throughput mass spectrometry quantitative lipidomic analysis was performed to reveal the lipid composition of urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients and healthy controls.  Results:   Control samples were first analysed to characterise the lipidome of urinary exosomes and test the reproducibility of the method. In total, 107 lipid species were quantified in urinary exosomes. Several differences, for example, in cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, were found between urinary exosomes and exosomes derived from cell lines, thus showing the importance of in vivo studies for biomarker analysis. The 36 most abundant lipid species in urinary exosomes were then quantified in 15 prostate cancer patients and 13 healthy controls. Interestingly, the levels of nine lipids species were found to be significantly different when the two groups were compared. The highest significance was shown for phosphatidylserine (PS) 18:1/18:1 and lactosylceramide (d18:1/16:0), the latter also showed the highest patient-to-control ratio. Furthermore, combinations of these lipid species and PS 18:0-18:2 distinguished the two groups with 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Finally, in agreement with the reported dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in cancer cells, alteration in specific sphingolipid lipid classes were observed.  Conclusion:   This study shows for the first time the potential use of exosomal lipid species in urine as prostate cancer biomarkers.""","""['Tore Skotland', 'Kim Ekroos', 'Dimple Kauhanen', 'Helena Simolin', 'Therese Seierstad', 'Viktor Berge', 'Kirsten Sandvig', 'Alicia Llorente']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Identification of prostate cancer biomarkers in urinary exosomes.', 'Molecular lipidomics of exosomes released by PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Exosomal proteins as prostate cancer biomarkers in urine: From mass spectrometry discovery to immunoassay-based validation.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'The expanding organelle lipidomes: current knowledge and challenges.', 'The lipid composition of extracellular vesicles: applications in diagnostics and therapeutic delivery.', 'Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles: bridging the communications between obesity and tumor microenvironment.', 'Metabolomic investigation of urinary extracellular vesicles for early detection and screening of lung cancer.', 'X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis of Nitrogen Environment in Small Extracellular Vesicle Membranes: A Potential Novel Technique with Application for Cancer Screening.']"""

In addition, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation-based gene silencing represent a common mechanism in prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression from normal cells to pre-initiated cells and ultimately to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, the control of epigenetic modification and the transcriptional/translational control of the activation of Nrf2 and Nrf2-target genes, including glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), appear to be an important mechanism that protects cells against injuries from oxidative stress and cancer development. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of AST in reactivating the expression of Nrf2 and GSTP1 through epigenetic modification in human prostate LNCaP cells. Treatment with AST in human LNCaP cells reduced the methylation of 21 CpG sites of the GSTP1 CpG island but did not affect the three CpG sites of the Nrf2 promoter region. AST induced the mRNA expression and protein expression of both Nrf2 and GSTP1. It also increased the mRNA expression of NQO1 in sh-mock LNCaP cells but not in sh-SETD7 LNCaP cells. Furthermore, AST reduced the protein expression of DNMT3b and significantly inhibited DNMT and HDAC activities in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that AST decreased the methylation status of the GSTP1, and these epigenetic modifying effects may originate from the decreasing activities of epigenetic modification enzymes, contributing to the overall beneficial health effects of AST.""","""['Yuqing Yang', 'Francisco Fuentes', 'Limin Shu', 'Chao Wang', 'Doug Pung', 'Wenji Li', 'Chengyue Zhang', 'Yue Guo', 'Ah-Ng Kong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['Reversal of GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation and reactivation of pi-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) expression in human prostate cancer cells by treatment with procainamide.', 'Epigenetic DNA methylation of antioxidative stress regulator NRF2 in human prostate cancer.', 'Dual action on promoter demethylation and chromatin by an isothiocyanate restored GSTP1 silenced in prostate cancer.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Trained immunity in monocyte/macrophage: Novel mechanism of phytochemicals in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.', 'The Anticancer Potential of Plant-Derived Nutraceuticals via the Modulation of Gene Expression.', 'Epigenetic Therapeutics Targeting NRF2/KEAP1 Signaling in Cancer Oxidative Stress.', 'A Systematic Review to Define the Multi-Faceted Role of Lysine Methyltransferase SETD7 in Cancer.', 'Recent Progress in Discovering the Role of Carotenoids and Their Metabolites in Prostatic Physiology and Pathology with a Focus on Prostate Cancer-A Review-Part I: Molecular Mechanisms of Carotenoid Action.']"""

Design:   A cross-sectional descriptive design was used in order to translate and validate the CRF Scale in Greek. Factor analyses were performed to understand the psychometric properties of the scale and to establish construct, criterion and convergent validity.  Setting:   Outpatients' oncology clinics of two public hospitals in Cyprus.  Participants:   148 patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing chemotherapy.  Results:   The Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS) had good stability (test-retest reliability r=0.79, p<0.001) and good internal consistency (Cronbach's α coefficient for all 15 items α=0.916). Furthermore, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO value) was found to be 0.743 and considered to be satisfactory (>0.5). The correlations between the CFS physical scale (CFS-FS scale) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 physical subscales were found to be significant (r=-0.715). The same occurred between CFS cognitive and EORTC cognitive subscale (r=-0.579). Overall, the criterion validity was verified. The same occurs for the convergent validity of the CFS since all correlations with the Global Health Status (q29-q30) were found to be significant.  Conclusions:   This is the first validation study of the CRF Scale in Greek and warrant of its use in the assessment of prostate cancer patient's related fatigue.

We sought to develop and validate PACE (Prostatectomy Assessment and Competence Evaluation), an objective and procedure specific tool to assess the quality of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Development and content validation of PACE was performed by deconstructing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy into 7 key domains utilizing the Delphi methodology. Reliability and construct validation were then assessed using de-identified videos performed by practicing surgeons and fellows. Consensus for each domain was defined as achieving a content validity index of 0.75 or greater. Reliability was assessed by the intraclass correlation and construct validation using a mixed linear model accounting for multiple ratings on the same video.  Results:   After 3 rounds consensus was reached on wording, relevance of the skills assessed and concordance between the score assigned and the skill assessed. An intraclass correlation of 0.4 or greater was achieved for all domains. The expert group outperformed trainees in all domains but reached statistical significance in bladder drop (4.5 vs 3.4, p = 0.002), preparation of the prostate (4.4 vs 3.2, p <0.0001), seminal vesicle and posterior plane dissection (8.3 vs 6.8, p = 0.03), and neurovascular bundle preservation (4.1 vs 2.4, p <0.0001). Limitations included the lack of assessment of other key skills such as communication and decision making.

Until now, Toyocamycin-induced apoptosis has not been reported to be involved in the regulation between mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.  Methods:   Cell viability assay, western blot, cell-cycle arrest, annexin V/propidium iodide assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ flux were assayed.  Results:   We investigated the apoptotic effect of Toyocamycin and the underlying molecular mechanism in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Toyocamycin treatment resulted in reduced cell viability of PC-3 cells, but not of non-malignant RWPE-1 cells. Toyocamycin enhanced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ROS production in PC-3 cells. In addition, MAPK proteins were activated upon Toyocamycin treatment. The p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activities were regulated by ROS-mediated signaling pathway underlying the Toyocamycin-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) recovered the Toyocamycin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS, and apoptosis. Additionally, p38 stimulated ROS production and inhibitory effects on ERK activation, while ERK inhibited the ROS production and had no effect on p38 activation.

The conformational flexibility has allowed to restore the normal biological function of mutant p53 by short peptides and small molecule compounds. Recently, studies have focused on physiological mechanisms such as acetylation of lysine residues to rescue the wild type activity of mutant p53. Using p53 null prostate cancer cell line we show that ID4 dependent acetylation promotes mutant p53 DNA-binding capabilities to its wild type consensus sequence, thus regulating p53-dependent target genes leading to subsequent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Specifically, by using wild type, mutant (P223L, V274F, R175H, R273H), acetylation mimics (K320Q and K373Q) and non-acetylation mimics (K320R and K373R) of p53, we identify that ID4 promotes acetylation of K373 and to a lesser extent K320, in turn restoring p53-dependent biological activities.

One of those trials, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, previously reported outcomes with 13 years of follow-up. This study presents updated findings from the PLCO trial.  Methods:   The PLCO trial randomized subjects from 1993 to 2001 to an intervention or control arm. Intervention-arm men received annual PSA tests for 6 years and digital rectal examinations for 4 years. This study used a linkage with the National Death Index to extend mortality follow-up to a maximum of 19 years after randomization.  Results:   Men were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 38,340) or the control arm (n = 38,343). The median follow-up time was 14.8 years (25th/75th, 12.7/16.5 years) in the intervention arm and 14.7 years (25th/75th, 12.6/16.4 years) in the control arm. There were 255 deaths from prostate cancer in the intervention arm and 244 deaths from prostate cancer in the control arm; this meant a rate ratio (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.24). The RR for all-cause mortality was 0.977 (95% CI, 0.950-1.004). It was estimated that 86% of the men in the control arm and 99% of the men in the intervention arm received any PSA testing during the trial, and the estimated yearly screening-phase PSA testing rates were 46% and 84%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Extended follow-up of the PLCO trial over a median of 15 years continues to indicate no reduction in prostate cancer mortality for the intervention arm versus the control arm. Because of the high rate of control-arm PSA testing, this finding can be viewed as showing no benefit of organized screening versus opportunistic screening.

Changes in prostate-specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase were also determined. 18F-choline PET/CT showed that treatment with radium-223 was able to effectively reduce bone metastatic disease, and this was accompanied by an excellent metabolic response.  Conclusions:   In clinical practice, metabolic assessment of lesions by 18F-choline PET/CT following radium-223 seems a valid approach to monitor treatment response. Until results from clinical trials become available, reporting of single cases relating to data on the use of this technique remains paramount.""","""['Piera Scalzi', 'Cinzia Baiocco', 'Sabrina Genovese', 'Antonella Trevisan', 'Zuzana Sirotova', 'Carlo Poti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['The Relationship Between Total Lesion Activity on 18F Choline Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography and Clinical Outcome in Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Treated with 223Radium.', 'Evaluating radium-223 response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with imaging.', 'Fluorine-18-fluorocholine PET/CT parameters predictive for hematological toxicity to radium-223 therapy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases: a pilot study.', 'Baseline 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and bone scan in the outcome prediction of patients treated with radium 223 dichloride.', 'Radionuclide Therapies in Prostate Cancer: Integrating Radium-223 in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Detection and Prediction.', 'The Potential Use of 11C-Choline Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography to Monitor the Treatment Effects of Radium-223 in a Patient with Prostate Cancer.']"""

We therefore evaluated the influence of potential mediators on the association between socioeconomic position, and prostate cancer-specific and all-cause death in prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a cohort study of prostate cancer patients in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. All patients completed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements at enrollment. Information on educational level, income, comorbidity and vital status was obtained by linkage to Danish nationwide registries. Clinical data and anthropometric measures were collected from medical records at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause and prostate cancer-specific death according to socioeconomic position and potential mediators.  Results:   We included 953 prostate cancer patients identified among 27 179 male participants in the Diet, Cancer and Health study who were followed for a median of 6.5 years (interquartile range 6.4-11.2 years). Patients with low socioeconomic position were more often overweight or obese at baseline. Low socioeconomic position was associated with increased prostate cancer-specific and all-cause death. The increased mortality could largely be explained by tumor aggressiveness, comorbidity, treatment and metabolic indicators, except for patients in the lowest income group.  Discussion:   Our study confirmed the a priori assumption that socioeconomic position is associated with increased mortality after prostate cancer. The increased mortality could largely be explained by lifestyle and clinical parameters.""","""['Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Jane Christensen', 'Christoffer Johansen', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Søren Friis', 'Peter Iversen', 'Susanne Oksbjerg Dalton']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Influence of metabolic indicators, smoking, alcohol and socioeconomic position on mortality after breast cancer.', 'Socioeconomic position and survival after lung cancer: Influence of stage, treatment and comorbidity among Danish patients with lung cancer diagnosed in 2004-2010.', 'Use of Low-Dose Aspirin and Mortality After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Educational level and the risk of depression after prostate cancer.', 'Influence of socioeconomic factors on survival after breast cancer--a nationwide cohort study of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Denmark 1983-1999.', 'How education level affects postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up: a single-center experience.', 'Prescription rates for commonly used drugs before and after a prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Socioeconomic Gradients in Prostate Cancer Incidence Among Canadian Males: A Trend Analysis From 1992 to 2010.', 'Factors Explaining Socio-Economic Inequalities in Cancer Survival: A Systematic Review.', 'The Effect of Payer Status on Survival of Patients With Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Data were as captured from 1) a prospective, non-interventional study counting 635 consecutive patients referred for M-staging in the 2008-2009 period at three regional hospitals within one county, and 2) a questionnaire on M-staging practice completed by the five sites performing M-staging in the same county in 2015.  Results:   All three sites referred patients for M-staging in 2008, irrespective of their risk factors. Two of the three sites maintained this practice in 2015. Furthermore, in 2015, three of five sites performed M-staging in intermediate and high-risk patients only. Planar whole-body bone scans were standard in all sites in 2008 with single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) being performed if required and if available. In 2015, two sites used choline positron emission tomography/CT for primary staging of high-risk patients against guideline recommendations. The use of SPECT/CT showed wide variations from ""if required"" to ""mandatory"" head-to-thigh imaging. There were notable variations between clinical practice and guidelines in 2008, and this was even more evident in 2015.  Conclusion:   Considerable variations existed with respect to the M-staging imaging practices in prostate cancer within a single Danish county. The variation was more pronounced in 2015 than in 2008.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective multicentre cohort study included 1252 consecutive patients with pT2 pN0/Nx and negative surgical margins on radical prostatectomy and without any adjuvant treatment, performed in three Belgian centres. BCR-free survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to determine clinical and pathological predictive factors of BCR in this group of patients.  Results:   In total, 910 patients were included. BCR occurred in 107 patients (11.8%) at a median follow-up of 108 months. Overall 5 and 10 year BCR-free survival rates were 90% and 87%, respectively.

It was assessed whether PB motion in the superior portion of PB-CTV (SUP-CTV) differed from the inferior PB-CTV (INF-CTV).  Patients and methods:   Eight pT2-3bN0-1M0 patients underwent postprostatectomy intensity-modulated radiotherapy, totaling 300 fractions. INF-CTV and SUP-CTV were defined as PB-CTV located inferior and superior to the superior border of the pubic symphysis, respectively. Daily pretreatment CT-on-rails images were compared to the planning CT in the left-right (LR), superoinferior (SI), and anteroposterior (AP) directions. Two parameters were defined: ""total PB-CTV motion"" represented total shifts from skin tattoos to RTOG-defined anatomic areas; ""PB-CTV target motion"" (performed for both SUP-CTV and INF-CTV) represented shifts from bone to RTOG-defined anatomic areas (i. e., subtracting shifts from skin tattoos to bone).  Results:   Mean (± standard deviation, SD) total PB-CTV motion was -1.5 (± 6.0), 1.3 (± 4.5), and 3.7 (± 5.7) mm in LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively. Mean (± SD) PB-CTV target motion was 0.2 (±1.4), 0.3 (±2.4), and 0 (±3.1) mm in the LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively. Mean (± SD) INF-CTV target motion was 0.1 (± 2.8), 0.5 (± 2.2), and 0.2 (± 2.5) mm, and SUP-CTV target motion was 0.3 (± 1.8), 0.5 (± 2.3), and 0 (± 5.0) mm in LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively. No statistically significant differences between INF-CTV and SUP-CTV motion were present in any direction.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been implicated in bladder cancer as well as other types of cancer including prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the expression and role of AR in gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cells and also the potential of enzalutamide, an AR inhibitor, as a therapeutic for the chemoresistance. First of all, we established gemcitabine-resistant T24 cells (T24GR) from T24 bladder cancer cells and performed gene expression profiling. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of AR expression in T24GR cells compared with T24 cells. AR mRNA and protein expression was confirmed to be increased in T24GR cells, respectively, by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis, which was associated with more potent AR transcriptional activity as measured by luciferase reporter assay. The copy number of AR gene in T24GR cells determined by PCR was twice as many as that of T24 cells. AR silencing by siRNA transfection resulted in inhibition of proliferation of T24GR cells. Cell culture in charcoal-stripped serum and treatment with enzalutamide inhibited growth of T24GR cells, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. AR transcriptional activity was found to be reduced in T24GR cells by enzalutamide treatment. Lastly, enzalutamide also inhibited cell proliferation of HTB5 bladder cancer cells that express AR and possess intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine. Our results suggest that enzalutamide may have the potential to treat patients with advanced gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer with increased AR expression.""","""['Koji Kameyama', 'Kengo Horie', 'Kosuke Mizutani', 'Taku Kato', 'Yasunori Fujita', 'Kyojiro Kawakami', 'Toshio Kojima', 'Tatsuhiko Miyazaki', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Inhibition of autophagy enhances the anticancer effect of enzalutamide on bladder cancer.', 'Enzalutamide inhibits androgen receptor-positive bladder cancer cell growth.', 'Critical role of androgen receptor level in prostate cancer cell resistance to new generation antiandrogen enzalutamide.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Crosstalk of disulfidptosis-related subtypes, establishment of a prognostic signature and immune infiltration characteristics in bladder cancer based on a machine learning survival framework.', 'The androgen receptor in bladder cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Induces Cisplatin Resistance via Down-Regulating GULP1 Expression in Bladder Cancer.', 'SPHK1 contributes to cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer cells via the NONO/STAT3 axis.', 'Sex Hormone Receptor Signaling in Bladder Cancer: A Potential Target for Enhancing the Efficacy of Conventional Non-Surgical Therapy.']"""

Labeling of PSMA tracers with 18F offers numerous advantages, including improved image resolution, longer half-life, and increased production yields. The aim of this study was to assess the PSA-stratified performance of the 18F-labeled PSMA tracer 18F-DCFPyL and the 68Ga-labeled reference 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC. Methods: We examined 191 consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence according to standard acquisition protocols using 18F-DCFPyL (n = 62, 269.8 MBq, PET scan at 120 min after injection) or 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (n = 129, 158.9 MBq, 60 min after injection). We determined PSA-stratified sensitivity rates for both tracers and corrected our calculations for Gleason scores using iterative matched-pair analyses. As an orthogonal validation, we directly compared tracer distribution patterns in a separate cohort of 25 patients, sequentially examined with both tracers. Results: After prostatectomy (n = 106), the sensitivity of both tracers was significantly associated with absolute PSA levels (P = 4.3 × 10-3). Sensitivity increased abruptly, when PSA values exceeded 0.5 μg/L (P = 2.4 × 10-5). For a PSA less than 3.5 μg/L, most relapses were diagnosed at a still limited stage (P = 3.4 × 10-6). For a PSA of 0.5-3.5 μg/L, PSA-stratified sensitivity was 88% (15/17) for 18F-DCFPyL and 66% (23/35) for 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC. This significant difference was preserved in the Gleason-matched-pair analysis. Outside of this range, sensitivity was comparably low (PSA < 0.5 μg/L) or high (PSA > 3.5 μg/L). After radiotherapy (n = 85), tracer sensitivity was largely PSA-independent. In the 25 patients examined with both tracers, distribution patterns of 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC were strongly comparable (P = 2.71 × 10-8). However, in 36% of the PSMA-positive patients we detected additional lesions on the 18F-DCFPyL scan (P = 3.7 × 10-2). Conclusion: Our data suggest that 18F-DCFPyL is noninferior to 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, while offering the advantages of 18F labeling. Our results indicate that imaging with 18F-DCFPyL may even exhibit improved sensitivity in localizing relapsed tumors after prostatectomy for moderately increased PSA levels. Although the standard acquisition protocols, used for 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in this study, stipulate different activity doses and tracer uptake times after injection, our findings provide a promising rationale for validation of 18F-DCFPyL in future prospective trials.""","""['Felix Dietlein', 'Carsten Kobe', 'Stephan Neubauer', 'Matthias Schmidt', 'Simone Stockter', 'Thomas Fischer', 'Klaus Schomäcker', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Boris D Zlatopolskiy', 'Bernd Neumaier', 'Alexander Drzezga', 'Markus Dietlein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Comparison of (18)FDCFPyL and  (68)GaGa-PSMA-HBED-CC for PSMA-PET Imaging in Patients with Relapsed Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Combined Early and Late 68GaPSMA-HBED-CC PET Scans Improve Lesion Detectability in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Low PSA Levels.', 'Performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Management at Initial Staging and Time of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 99mTc-Labeled PSMA-Targeted Tracers Based on the Lys-Urea-Aad Pharmacophore for Detecting Prostate Cancer with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography.', 'Using 18F-DCFPyL Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Define Intraprostatic Boosts for Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'PSMA-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals in Prostate Cancer: Current Data and New Trials.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in early relapsed prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here we report that G-1, through GPR30, activated Gαi1 proteins to sustain Erk1/2 activation but failed to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) for cAMP production in PCa cells. The chemical-induced activation of AC-cAMP-PKA signaling attenuated Erk1/2 activity and blocked the cell growth inhibitory effects of G-1. Furthermore, PCa predominantly expressed Gαi1 proteins. Silencing of Gαi1 expression blocked the inhibitory effects of G-1 on PCa cell growth. By gene expression profiling, GPR30 activation by G-1 interfered expression of cell cycle regulators and machinery elements to modulate PCa cell growth and the RACGAP1 interactome to control metastatic properties. In this regard, we demonstrated that G-1 inhibited PCa cell migration and invasion with reduced formations of filopodia and stress fibers through a GPR30-dependent pathway. Taken together, our findings revealed the underlying mechanism for sustaining Erk1/2 activation upon GPR30 activation by G-1 in PCa cells and the GPR30-mediated pathways in controlling PCa cell growth and metastatic properties.""","""['Kin-Mang Lau', 'Fanny Man-Ting Ma', 'Jenny Tian Xia', 'Queeny Kwan Yi Chan', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Ka-Fai To']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Activation of GPR30 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells through sustained activation of Erk1/2, c-jun/c-fos-dependent upregulation of p21, and induction of G(2) cell-cycle arrest.', 'Estrogen action via the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR30: stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-mediated attenuation of the epidermal growth factor receptor-to-MAPK signaling axis.', 'G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1)/GPR30 increases ERK1/2 activity through PDZ motif-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Importance of Estrogenic Signaling and Its Mediated Receptors in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in maintenance of meiotic arrest in fish oocytes.', 'Role of the G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Cancer and Stromal Cells: From Functions to Novel Therapeutic Perspectives.', 'Distribution and Effects of Estrogen Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Associated Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Molecular Characterization of Membrane Steroid Receptors in Hormone-Sensitive Cancers.', 'Role of G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor in Digestive System Carcinomas: A Minireview.', 'GPER-Induced ERK Signaling Decreases Cell Viability of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   For 22 prostate cancer patients, two dual arc VMAT plans were made with (1) fixed collimators (45° and 315°) and (2) a rotating collimator that aligned the MLC leaves with the dominant prostate motion direction (population-based first principal component). The fixed and rotating collimator plan quality was compared using selected dose-volume indices. Next, MLC tracking treatments were simulated with 695 patient-measured prostate traces. The MLC exposure error (under- and overexposed MLC area in beam's eye view) was calculated as a surrogate for the MLC tracking error. Finally, motion including dose reconstruction was performed for 35 motion traces for one patient, and the root-mean-square dose error was compared with the MLC exposure error.  Results:   Rotating collimator VMAT plans were of similar quality as the fixed collimator plans, but significantly improved MLC tracking with 33% lower MLC exposure errors (p≪0.0001). The reductions in MLC exposure error correlated significantly with dose error reductions.  Conclusion:   Prostate VMAT plans with rotating collimator were of similar quality as fixed collimator plans, but more suitable for MLC tracking with significantly better agreement between planned and delivered dose distributions. MLC tracking for prostate cancer patients can therefore be improved without the requirement of additional efforts or hardware changes.""","""['Ghulam Murtaza', 'Jakob Toftegaard', 'Ehsan Ullah Khan', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'An experimentally validated couch and MLC tracking simulator used to investigate hybrid couch-MLC tracking.', 'Potential improvements of lung and prostate MLC tracking investigated by treatment simulations.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'A review of progress of real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy technology based on dynamic multi-leaf collimator.', 'Sub-arc collimator angle optimization based on the conformity index heatmap for VMAT planning of multiple brain metastases SRS treatments.', 'Optimization of collimator angles in dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampus and inner ear sparing.', 'Dosimetric impact of intrafraction motion on boosts on intraprostatic lesions: a simulation based on actual motion data from real time ultrasound tracking.', 'Technical Note: In silico and experimental evaluation of two leaf-fitting algorithms for MLC tracking based on exposure error and plan complexity.']"""

Several epidemiological studies have suggested increased prostate cancer incidence and mortality due to exposure to arsenic. Due to lack of an animal model of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis, we used a prostate epithelial cell culture model to identify a role for mitochondria in arsenic-induced prostate cancer. Mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential was impacted within a few hours of arsenic exposure of non-neoplastic prostate epithelial cells. Chronic arsenic treatment induced mutations in mitochondrial genes and altered mitochondrial functions. Human non-neoplastic prostate epithelial cells continuously cultured for seven months in the presence of 5 µM arsenite showed tumorigenic properties in vitro and induced tumors in SCID mice, which indicated transformation of these cells. Protein and mRNA expression of subunits of mtOXPHOS complex I were decreased in arsenic-transformed cells. Alterations in complex I, a main site for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as increased expression of ROS-producing NOX4 in arsenic-transformed cells suggested a role of oxidative stress in tumorigenic transformation of prostate epithelial cells. Whole genome cGH array analyses of arsenic-transformed prostate cells identified extensive genomic instability. Our study revealed mitochondrial dysfunction induced oxidative stress and decreased expression of p53 in arsenic-transformed cells as an underlying mechanism of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomic instability. These studies suggest that early changes in mitochondrial functions are sustained during prolong arsenic exposure. Overall, our study provides evidence that arsenic disruption of mitochondrial function is an early and key step in tumorigenic transformation of prostate epithelial cells.""","""['B Singh', 'M Kulawiec', 'K M Owens', 'A Singh', 'K K Singh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochemistry (Mosc)""","""['Chronic exposure to arsenic causes increased cell survival, DNA damage, and increased expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) in human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Biochemical and Molecular Alterations Following Arsenic-Induced Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Rat Brain.', 'Mitochondria and NADPH oxidases are the major sources of TNF-α/cycloheximide-induced oxidative stress in murine intestinal epithelial MODE-K cells.', 'The causes of cancer revisited: ""mitochondrial malignancy"" and ROS-induced oncogenic transformation - why mitochondria are targets for cancer therapy.', 'Oxidative mechanism of arsenic toxicity and carcinogenesis.', 'Metabolomic dynamics of the arsenic-transformed bronchial epithelial cells and the derived cancer stem-like cells.', 'Environmental Toxicant Exposures and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Two Interrelated Public Health Problems on the Rise.']"""

An inflatable rectal ultrasound probe cover is frequently utilized during the procedure to adjust for unfavorable prostate position relative to the implant grid. However, the inflated cover causes prostate deformation, which is not accounted for during dosimetric planning. Most of the therapeutic dose is delivered after the procedure when the prostate and surrounding organs-at-risk are less deformed. The aim of this study is to quantify the potential dosimetry changes between the initial plan (prostate deformed) and the more realistic dosimetry when the prostate is less deformed without the cover.  Methods:   The authors prospectively collected the ultrasound images of the prostate immediately preceding and just after inflation of the rectal probe cover from thirty-four consecutive patients undergoing real-time planning of I-125 permanent seed implant. Manual segmentations of the deformed and undeformed images from each case were used as the input for model training to generate the initial transformation of a testing patient. During registration, the pixel-to-pixel transformation was further optimized to maximize the mutual information between the transferred deformed image and the undeformed images. The accuracy of image registration was evaluated by comparing the displacement of the urethra and calcification landmarks and by determining the Dice index between the registered and manual prostate contours. After registration, using the optimized transformation, the implanted seeds were mapped from the deformed prostate onto the undeformed prostate. The dose distribution of the undeformed anatomy, calculated using the VariSeed treatment planning system, was then analyzed and compared with that of the deformed prostate.  Results:   The accuracy of image registration was 1.5 ± 1.0 mm when evaluated by the displacement of calcification landmarks, 1.9 ± 1.1 mm when characterized by the displacement of the centroid of the urethra, and 0.86 ± 0.05 from the determination of the Dice index of prostate contours. The magnitude of dosimetric changes was associated with the degree of prostate deformation. The prostate coverage V100% dropped from 96.6 ± 1.7% on prostate-deformed plans to 92.6 ± 3.8% (p < 0.01) on undeformed plans, and the rectum V100% decreased from 0.48 ± 0.39 to 0.06 ± 0.14 cm3 (p < 0.01). The dose to the urethra increased, with the V150% increasing from 0.02 ± 0.06 to 0.11 ± 0.10 cm3 (p < 0.01) and D1% changing from 203.5 ± 22.7 to 239.5 ± 25.6 Gy (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Prostate deformation from the inflation of an ultrasound rectal probe cover can significantly alter brachytherapy dosimetry. The authors have developed a deformable image registration method that allows for the characterization of dose with the undeformed anatomy. This may be used to more accurately reflect the dosimetry when the prostate is not deformed by the probe cover.""","""['Jun Lian', 'Yeqin Shao', 'Larry D Potter', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Jordan A Holmes', 'Eleanor A Pryser', 'Jie Shen', 'Dinggang Shen', 'Andrew Z Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Loose versus stranded seeds in permanent prostate brachytherapy: dosimetric comparison of intraoperative plans.', 'Intraoperative and post-implant dosimetry in patients treated with permanent prostate implant brachytherapy.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'The role of transrectal ultrasound on prostatic cryotherapy and brachytherapy.']"""

Three dosimetry models based on either dose point kernels or Monte Carlo simulations were used and evaluated. The second and overlapping aim, was to perform DAR imaging and dosimetric analysis of the distribution of radioactivity, and hence the absorbed dose rate, in tumor sections at an early time point after injection during radioimmunotherapy using 177Lu-h11B6, directed against the human kallikrein 2 antigen.  Methods:   Male immunodeficient BALB/c nude mice, aged 6-8 w, were inoculated by subcutaneous injection of ∼107 LNCaP cells in a 200 μl suspension of a 1:1 mixture of medium and Matrigel. The antibody h11B6 was conjugated with the chelator CHX-A″-DTPA after which conjugated h11B6 was mixed with 177LuCl3. The incubation was performed at room temperature for 2 h, after which the labeling was terminated and the solution was purified on a NAP-5 column. About 20 MBq 177Lu-h11B6 was injected intravenously in the tail vein. At approximately 10 h postinjection (hpi), the mice were sacrificed and one tumor was collected from each of the five animals and cryosectioned into 10 μm thick slices. The tumor slices were measured and imaged using the DAR MicroImager system and the M3Vision software. Then the absorbed dose rate was calculated using a dose point kernel generated with the Monte Carlo code gate v7.0.  Results:   The DAR system produced high resolution images of the radioactivity distribution, close to the resolution of single PCa cells. The DAR images revealed a pronounced heterogeneous radioactivity distribution, i.e., count rate per area, in the tumors, indicated by the normalized intensity variations along cross sections as mean ± SD: 0.15 ± 0.15, 0.20 ± 0.18, 0.12 ± 0.17, 0.15 ± 0.16, and 0.23 ± 0.22, for each tumor section, respectively. The absorbed dose rate distribution for 177Lu at the time of dissection 10 hpi showed a maximum value of 2.9 ± 0.4 Gy/h (mean ± SD), compared to 6.0 ± 0.9 and 159 ± 25 Gy/h for the hypothetical 90Y and 7 MeV alpha-particle cases assuming the same count rate densities. Mean absorbed dose rate values were 0.13, 0.53, and 6.43 Gy/h for 177Lu, 90Y, and alpha-particles, respectively.  Conclusions:   The initial uptake of 177Lu-h11B6 produces a high absorbed dose rate, which is important for a successful therapeutic outcome. The hypothetical 90Y case indicates a less heterogeneous absorbed dose rate distribution and a higher mean absorbed dose rate compared to 177Lu, although with a potentially increased irradiation of surrounding healthy tissue. The hypothetical alpha-particle case indicates the possibility of a higher maximum absorbed dose rate, although with a more heterogeneous absorbed dose rate distribution.""","""['Oskar V Timmermand', 'Jenny Nilsson', 'Sven-Erik Strand', 'Jörgen Elgqvist']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Preclinical efficacy of hK2 targeted 177Luhu11B6 for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Intratherapeutic biokinetic measurements, dosimetry parameter estimates, and monitoring of treatment efficacy using cerenkov luminescence imaging in preclinical radionuclide therapy.', '177Lu-AMBA biodistribution, radiotherapeutic efficacy, imaging, and autoradiography in prostate cancer models with low GRP-R expression.', 'Absorbed dose distributions from beta-decaying radionuclides: Experimental validation of Monte Carlo tools for radiopharmaceutical dosimetry.', 'Radiation Imagers for Quantitative, Single-particle Digital Autoradiography of Alpha- and Beta-particle Emitters.', 'Targeting Prostate Cancer Stem Cells with Alpha-Particle Therapy.']"""

In order to identify MMR associated mutations in prostate cancer we have performed whole genome sequencing of the MMR deficient PC346C prostate cancer cell line. We detected a total of 1196 mutations in PC346C which was 1.5-fold higher compared to a MMR proficient prostate cancer sample (G089). Of all different mutation classes, frameshifts in mononucleotide repeat (MNR) sequences were significantly enriched in the PC346C sample. As a result, a selection of genes with frameshift mutations in MNR was further assessed regarding its mutational status in a comprehensive panel of prostate, ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer cell lines. We identified PRRT2 and DAB2IP to be frequently mutated in MMR deficient cell lines, colorectal and endometrial cancer patient samples. Further characterization of PRRT2 revealed an important role of this gene in cancer biology. Both normal prostate cell lines and a colorectal cancer cell line showed increased proliferation, migration and invasion when expressing the mutated form of PRRT2 (ΔPRRT2).

Since high-throughput sequencing approaches survey fusion events exhaustively, several computational methods for the detection of gene fusions from RNA-seq data have been developed. This kind of analysis, however, is complicated by native trans-splicing events, the splicing-induced complexity of the transcriptome and biases and artefacts introduced in experiments and data analysis. There are a number of tools available for the detection of fusions from RNA-seq data; however, certain differences in specificity and sensitivity between commonly used approaches have been found. The ability to detect gene fusions of different types, including isoform fusions and fusions involving non-coding regions, has not been thoroughly studied yet. Here, we propose a novel computational toolkit called InFusion for fusion gene detection from RNA-seq data. InFusion introduces several unique features, such as discovery of fusions involving intergenic regions, and detection of anti-sense transcription in chimeric RNAs based on strand-specificity. Our approach demonstrates superior detection accuracy on simulated data and several public RNA-seq datasets. This improved performance was also evident when evaluating data from RNA deep-sequencing of two well-established prostate cancer cell lines.

Differences in location and cancer grade detected on TTMB were evaluated as a function of the number of prior TRUS biopsies.  Results:   Of the 1118 patients, 679 were diagnosed with prostate cancer. This included 208, 325, 104, and 42 patients who underwent 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 prior TRUS biopsies. The incidence of cancer detection on TTMB decreased as the number of prior TRUS biopsies increased (73.5% vs. 62.4% vs. 51.7% vs. 37.2%, P<0.001); however, it became increasingly likely that TTMB would detect anterior prostate only as the number of prior TRUS biopsies increased (P=0.007). Moreover, the incidence of high grade cancer (Gleason score ≥7) in the anterior gland increased with the number of previous TRUS biopsies.  Conclusions:   TTMB detected prostate cancer in over half of the patients with one or more negative TRUS biopsies. The majority of TTMB detected cancers were Gleason score ≥7. As the number of prior TRUS biopsies increased, there was a commensurate increase in the proportion of high-grade, anterior only disease.""","""['Nathan Bittner', 'Gregory Merrick', 'Al Taira', 'Abbey Bennett', 'Amy Schattel', 'Wayne Butler', 'Robert Galbreath', 'Edward Adamovich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Cancer Location in Upgrading and Detection after Transperineal Template-Guided Mapping Biopsy for Patients in Active Surveillance and Negative Transrectal Ultrasonography-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Transperineal Template-guided Mapping Biopsy Identifies Pathologic Differences Between Very-Low-risk and Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Clinical performance of transperineal template guided mapping biopsy for therapeutic decision making in low risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches.', 'Development of a novel nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with the prostate health index and multiparametric MRI.', 'Utility of multiple core biopsies during transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy for patients with large prostates and PI-RADS 1-2 on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Scores to Select an Optimal Prostate Biopsy Method: A Secondary Analysis of the Trio Study.', 'MRI-Targeted, Systematic, and Combined Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Incidence, grade and distribution of prostate cancer following transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation.']"""

Therefore, manipulating lipid metabolism is a potential PCa therapy strategy. In this study, our goal is to investigate the role of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in regulating the proliferation and lipid metabolism of human PCa cells following its ligand chenodexycholic acid (CDCA) treatment.  Methods:   Oil Red O was used to stain lipid contents in PCa cells, and siRNA knockdown was performed to deplete FXR expression. To study the cell proliferation when treated by CDCA or FXR knockdown, cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) was adopted to evaluate tumor cell growth. Western blot was used for protein analysis.  Results:   Our data suggest that activation of FXR by CDCA reduces lipid accumulation and significantly inhibits cells proliferation in prostate tumor cells. Instead, CDCA treatment doesn't affect normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells growth in vitro. FXR activation decreases mRNA and protein levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and some other key regulators involved in lipid metabolism.

Flow cytometry was used to check the influence of busulfan on apoptosis rate of prostate cancer cell line LAPC4. Expression level of androgen receptor (AR), Src and Ack1 and change in phosphatization of AR after busulfan treatment were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Finally, influence o proliferation ability and apoptosis of LAPC4 were measured using EGF-busulfan co-processing.  Results:   Significant dose-dependency was observed as killing ability rises with higher busulfan concentration (p<0.05). Significant improvement in prostate cancer cell inhibition ability of busulfan was also observed with prolonging of time (p<0.05). Then we discovered, as indicated by flow cytometry, that busulfan inhibits prostate cancer cell LAPC4 proliferation by strengthening its apoptosis (p<0.05), which showed significant dose- and time-dependency. Detection of AR expression and phosphatization level showed no significant influence on mRNA and protein expression level of AR made by busulfan. However, decline of phosphatization level at AR Y534 site was positively related to busulfan treatment time. Busulfan was found to be inhibitory to Src kinase induced by EGF and level of resulting AR phosphatization in our further probe into the mechanism of busulfan influence on phosphatization level at AR Y534 site. Nude mice experiment indicated that busulfan was inhibitory to protein expression of AR downstream target gene prostate specific antigen (PSA) and human tissue kallikrein2 (hk-2), thus inhibited in vivo tumorigenic ability of prostate cancer cells.

Recent reports highlight the emergence of AR splice variants lacking the LBD that can arise during disease progression and contribute to castrate resistance. Here, we report a novel N-terminal ubiquitination site at lysine 311. Ubiquitination of this site plays a role in AR stability and is critical for its transcriptional activity. Inactivation of this site causes AR to accumulate on chromatin and inactivates its transcriptional function as a consequence of inability to bind to p300. Additionally, mutation at lysine 311 affects cellular transcriptome altering the expression of genes involved in chromatin organization, signaling, adhesion, motility, development and metabolism. Even though this site is present in clinically relevant AR-variants it can only be ubiquitinated in cells when AR retains LBD suggesting a role for AR C-terminus in E2/E3 substrate recognition.

The miRs-Plus-A1083, -92b-5p, -18a-3p, -19a-3p, -639, -3622b-3p, -3189-3p, -155-3p, -410, -1179, 548b-5p, and -4469 are predominantly expressed (7-11-fold), whereas miRs-595, 4490, -3120-5p, -1299, -21-5p, -3677-3, -let-7b-5p, -5189, 3-121-5p, -4518, -200a-5p, -3682-5p, -3689d, -3149 represent the most downregulated (12-113-fold) miRNAs in microdissected prostate tumors. The array expression profile of selected miRNA signature and their potential mRNA targets was validated by qRT-PCR analysis in PC cell lines. Integrated in silico and computational prediction analyses demonstrated that the dysregulated miRNA signature map to key regulatory factors involved in tumorigenesis, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and p53 pathways. The newly identified miRNA signature has potential clinical utility as biomarkers, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic targets for early detection of PC. Further studies are needed to assess the functional significance and clinical usefulness of the identified miRNAs. Impact Statement To our knowledge his is the first study of identifying miRNA signatures in microdissected indolent (Gleason score 6) prostate cancer in comparison to matched normal prostate epithelium. By employing in silico and computational prediction analysis, the study provides a landscape of potential miRNA targets and key cellular pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Identification if miRNAs and their relevant targets and pathways pave the way for underpinning their mechanistic role of miRNAs in human prostate tumorigenesis, and possibly other human cancers. Importantly, the outcome of the study has important clinical implications for the management of prostate cancer, including the use of miRNA(s) as biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Ahmed A Moustafa', 'Mohammed Ziada', 'Abubaker Elshaikh', 'Amrita Datta', 'Hogyoung Kim', 'Krzysztof Moroz', 'Sudesh Srivastav', 'Raju Thomas', 'Jonathan L Silberstein', 'Krishnarao Moparty', 'Fatma Elzahraa H Salem', 'Ola H El-Habit', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Biol Med (Maywood)""","""['Differential expression profiles of microRNAs as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.', 'The clinical significance of downregulation of mir-124-3p, mir-146a-5p, mir-155-5p and mir-335-5p in gastric cancer tumorigenesis.', 'Identification of microRNA biomarkers in the blood of breast cancer patients based on microRNA profiling.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Diagnostic value of microRNAs in asbestos exposure and malignant mesothelioma: systematic review and qualitative meta-analysis.', 'MicroRNA panel in serum reveals novel diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Combining Everolimus and Ku0063794 Promotes Apoptosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells via Reduced Autophagy Resulting from Diminished Expression of miR-4790-3p.', 'Detection and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer Using Blood-Based Biomarkers.', 'A network embedding-based multiple information integration method for the MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Bayesian multilevel model of micro RNA levels in ovarian-cancer and healthy subjects.']"""

Setting and methods The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial randomized 154,900 individuals to either an intervention or control arm. Enrolled eligible participants were aged 55-74, had no history of trial cancers, and no current treatment for cancer. Intervention arm women received CA-125 tests and transvaginal ultrasound. Bimanual ovarian palpation was offered annually during the first four years of the trial. Bimanual ovarian palpation-specific sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were rates of diagnostic procedures and resulting complications following positive bimanual ovarian palpation screens. Results A total of 20,872 women received at least one bimanual ovarian palpation, with 50,498 total bimanual ovarian palpation examinations performed. The sensitivity and specificity of bimanual ovarian palpation were 5.1% (2/39) and 99.0% (49,957/50,459), respectively; no cases were detected by bimanual ovarian palpation alone. Rates for most follow-up procedures for abnormal results in women without ovarian cancer were higher among the group with another screening test positive, except for pelvic exam, where rates were similar. No complications were reported in the bimanual ovarian palpation-only positive group.

Recombinant progranulin bound with high affinity to EphA2 in both solid phase and solution. Interaction of progranulin with EphA2 caused prolonged activation of the receptor, downstream stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, and promotion of capillary morphogenesis. Furthermore, we found an autoregulatory mechanism of progranulin whereby a feed-forward loop occurred in an EphA2-dependent manner that was independent of the endocytic receptor sortilin.

Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.""","""['Ayush Singhal', 'Michael Simmons', 'Zhiyong Lu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Text mining for precision medicine: automating disease-mutation relationship extraction from biomedical literature.', 'Text mining facilitates database curation - extraction of mutation-disease associations from Bio-medical literature.', 'Overview of the BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track: mining protein interactions and mutations for precision medicine.', 'Text Mining for Precision Medicine: Bringing Structure to EHRs and Biomedical Literature to Understand Genes and Health.', 'Facts from text: can text mining help to scale-up high-quality manual curation of gene products with ontologies?', 'CoVEffect: interactive system for mining the effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variants based on deep learning.', 'AIONER: all-in-one scheme-based biomedical named entity recognition using deep learning.', 'Molecular and network-level mechanisms explaining individual differences in autism spectrum disorder.', 'Chemical-protein relation extraction with ensembles of carefully tuned pretrained language models.', 'Computational Analyses Reveal Fundamental Properties of the Hemophilia Literature in the Last 6 Decades.']"""

Results:   Nuclear PKC expression strongly correlated with nuclear pARS578 (c.c. 0.469, p=0.001) and cytoplasmic pARS578 (c.c. 0.426 p=0.002). High cytoplasmic and nuclear pARS578 were associated with disease-specific survival (p<0.001 and p=0.036 respectively). High nuclear PKC was associated with lower disease-specific survival when combined with high pARS578 in the cytoplasm (p=0.001) and nucleus (p=0.038). Combined high total pARS81 and total pARS578 was associated with decreased disease-specific survival (p=0.005).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can negatively regulate target mRNA expression at post-transcriptional levels. In head and neck cancer (HNC), our analysis of miRNA arrays showed that miR-7, miR-196 and miR-335 were significantly up-regulated in CAFs when compared with their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs). FAP, α-SMA and FSP, specific markers of CAFs, were significantly expressed in CAFs. Functionally, exogenous expression of miR-7 in NFs induced a functional conversion of NFs into CAFs. In contrast, inhibition of miR-7 expression in CAFs could induce a functional conversion of CAFs into NFs. Our study demonstrated that overexpression of miR-7 in NFs significantly increased the migration activity and growth rates of cancer cells in co-culture experiments. Mechanistically, we confirmed that the RASSF2-PAR-4 axis was mainly responsible for miR-7 functions in CAFs using bioinformatics methods. Overexpression of miR-7 in CAFs led to down-regulation of RASSF2, which dramatically decreased the secretion of PAR-4 from CAFs and then enhanced the proliferation and migration of the co-cultured cancer cells.

In addition, the fatty acid synthase inhibitor drug C75 has been reported to synergistically enhance the cancer-killing ability of ionizing radiation. However, clinical use of C75 has been limited due to its producing weight loss, believed to be caused by alterations in the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. C75 is administered in the form of a racemic mixture of (-) and (+) enantiomers that may differ in their regulation of fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1.

PIM proteins are regulated through transcription and stability by JAK/STAT pathways and are overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The PIM kinases possess weak oncogenic abilities, but enhance other genes or chemical carcinogens to induce tumors. We generated conditional transgenic mice that overexpress PIM1 or PIM2 in male reproductive organs and analyzed their contribution to tumorigenesis. We found an increase in alterations of sexual organs and hyperplasia in the transgenic mice correlating with inflammation. We also found that PIM1/2 are overexpressed in a subset of human male germ cells and prostate tumors correlating with inflammatory features and stem cell markers. Our data suggest that PIM1/2 kinase overexpression is a common feature of male reproductive organs tumors, which provoke tissue alterations and a large inflammatory response that may act synergistically during the process of tumorigenesis. There is also a correlation with markers of cancer stem cells, which may contribute to the therapy resistance found in tumors overexpressing PIM kinases.""","""['Manuel Pedro Jiménez-García', 'Antonio Lucena-Cacace', 'María José Robles-Frías', 'Maja Narlik-Grassow', 'Carmen Blanco-Aparicio', 'Amancio Carnero']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Inflammation and stem markers association to PIM1/PIM2 kinase-induced tumors in breast and uterus.', 'PIM kinases: an overview in tumors and recent advances in pancreatic cancer.', 'Conditional transgenic expression of PIM1 kinase in prostate induces inflammation-dependent neoplasia.', 'PIM kinases are essential for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival (PIM2/3) and CXCR4-mediated microenvironmental interactions (PIM1).', 'PIM serine/threonine kinases in the pathogenesis and therapy of hematologic malignancies and solid cancers.', 'Targeting PIM Kinases to Improve the Efficacy of Immunotherapy.', 'Discovery of novel natural products as dual MNK/PIM inhibitors for acute myeloid leukemia treatment: Pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics studies.', 'The Role of PIM Kinases in Pediatric Solid Tumors.', 'Vertebrate Cell Differentiation, Evolution, and Diseases: The Vertebrate-Specific Developmental Potential Guardians VENTX/NANOG and POU5/OCT4 Enter the Stage.', 'PIM1 phosphorylation of the androgen receptor and 14-3-3 ζ regulates gene transcription in prostate cancer.']"""

While it is critical to identify histologically normal tissue that is independent of the tumor lineage, few additional considerations are applied to the choice of this material for such measurements.  Methods:   Normal formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded seminal vesicle, and urethral tissues, in addition to whole blood, were collected from 31 prostate cancer patients having undergone radical prostatectomy. Genotype concordance was evaluated for DNA from each tissue source in relation to whole blood.  Results:   Overall, there was a greater genotype call rate for DNA derived from urethral tissue (97.0%) in comparison with patient-matched seminal vesicle tissues (95.9%, P = 0.0015). Furthermore, with reference to patient-matched whole blood, urethral samples exhibited higher genotype concordance (94.1%) than that of seminal vesicle samples (92.5%, P = 0.035).

However, the association of combination therapy in cholesterol reduction on prostate or any cancer is unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of the cholesterol lowering drugs simvastatin and ezetimibe alone or in combination on the growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer in vivo xenografts.  Methods:   Proliferation assays were conducted by MTS solution and assessed by Student's t-test. 90 male nude mice were placed on a high-cholesterol Western-diet for 7 days then injected subcutaneously with 1 × 105 LAPC-4 cells. Two weeks post-injection, mice were randomized to control, 11 mg/kg/day simvastatin, 30 mg/kg ezetimibe, or the combination and sacrificed 42 days post-randomization. We used a generalized linear model with the predictor variables of treatment, time, and treatment by time (i.e., interaction term) with tumor volume as the outcome variable. Total serum and tumor cholesterol were measured. Tumoral RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized from 1 ug of total RNA for quantitative real-time PCR.  Results:   Simvastatin directly reduced in vitro prostate cell proliferation in a dose-dependent, cell line-specific manner, but ezetimibe had no effect. In vivo, low continuous dosing of ezetimibe, delivered by food, or simvastatin, delivered via an osmotic pump had no effect on tumor growth compared to control mice. In contrast, dual treatment of simvastatin and ezetimibe accelerated tumor growth. Ezetimibe significantly lowered serum cholesterol by 15%, while simvastatin had no effect. Ezetimibe treatment resulted in higher tumor cholesterol. A sixfold induction of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA was observed in ezetimibe and the combination with simvastatin versus control tumors.  Conclusions:   Systemic cholesterol lowering by ezetimibe did not slow tumor growth, nor did the cholesterol independent effects of simvastatin and the combined treatment increased tumor growth. Despite lower serum cholesterol, tumors from ezetimibe treated mice had higher levels of cholesterol. This study suggests that induction of low density lipoprotein receptor is a possible mechanism of resistance that prostate tumors use to counteract the therapeutic effects of lowering serum cholesterol.

Hence, in the present study, we evaluated the potential of cardamonin (CD), a 2',4'-dihydroxy-6'-methoxychalcone, to modulate STAT3 activation in prostate cancer (PC) cells and found that this chalcone can indeed exhibit significant anticancer effects through negatively regulating STAT3 activation by diverse molecular mechanism(s). CD suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and DNA binding ability in PC cells. Computational modeling revealed that CD can bind directly to the Src Homology 2 domain of STAT3 and also effectively inhibit its dimerization.

Despite a high overall detection rate, the visualisation of local recurrence may be hampered by high physiologic tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder on whole body imaging, usually starting 60 min after injection. This study sought to verify whether early dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)PET/CT can differentiate pathologic PC-related tracer uptake from physiologic tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder.  Methods:   Eighty consecutive PC patients referred to 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/CT were included in this retrospective analysis (biochemical relapse: n = 64; primary staging: n = 8; evaluation of therapy response/restaging: n = 8). In addition to whole-body PET/CT acquisition 60 min post injection early dynamic imaging of the pelvis in the first 8 min after tracer injection was performed. SUVmax of pathologic lesions was calculated and time-activity curves were generated and compared to those of urinary bladder and areas of physiologic tracer uptake.  Results:   A total of 55 lesions consistent with malignancy on 60 min whole body imaging exhibited also pathologic 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake during early dynamic imaging (prostatic bed/prostate gland: n = 27; lymph nodes: n = 12; bone: n = 16). All pathologic lesions showed tracer uptake within the first 3 min, whereas urinary bladder activity was absent within the first 3 min of dynamic imaging in all patients. Suvmax was significantly higher in PC lesions in the first 6 min compared to urinary bladder accumulation (p < 0.001). In the subgroup of PC patients with biochemical relapse the detection rate of local recurrence could be increased from 20.3 to 29.7%.  Conclusions:   Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT reliably enables the differentiation of pathologic tracer uptake in PC lesions from physiologic bladder accumulation.

Recent advances in genomic technologies have enhanced the possibility of identifying causative genes in such cases. Two siblings, an elder sister and a younger brother, were found to have multiple primary lung cancers at the age of 60. The former subsequently developed breast cancer and had a history of uterine myoma. The latter had initially developed prostate cancer at the age of 59 and had a history of colon cancer. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping revealed that ∼10% of the genomes were homozygous in both patients. Exome sequencing revealed nonsynonymous mutations in five genes in the runs of homozygosity: CHEK2, FCGRT, INPP5J, MYO18B, and SFI1. Evolutionary conservation of primary protein structures suggested the functional importance of the CHEK2 mutation, p.R474C. This mutation altered the tertiary structure of CHK2 by disrupting the salt bridge between p.R474 and p.E394. No such structural changes were observed with the other mutated genes. Subsequent cell-based transfection analysis revealed that CHK2 p.R474C was unstable and scarcely activated.

However, understanding of the pathways involved remains incomplete. In this study, we performed a high-throughput genetic screen to identify kinases that enable tumor formation by androgen-dependent prostate epithelial (LHSR-AR) cells under androgen-deprived conditions. In addition to the identification of known mediators of castration resistance, which served to validate the screen, we identified a mitotic-related serine/threonine kinase, NEK6, as a mediator of androgen-independent tumor growth. NEK6 was overexpressed in a subset of human prostate cancers. Silencing NEK6 in castration-resistant cancer cells was sufficient to restore sensitivity to castration in a mouse xenograft model system. Tumors in which castration resistance was conferred by NEK6 were predominantly squamous in histology with no evidence of AR signaling. Gene expression profiling suggested that NEK6 overexpression stimulated cytoskeletal, differentiation, and immune signaling pathways and maintained gene expression patterns normally decreased by castration. Phosphoproteome profiling revealed the transcription factor FOXJ2 as a novel NEK6 substrate, with FOXJ2 phosphorylation associated with increased expression of newly identified NEK6 transcriptional targets. Overall, our studies establish NEK6 signaling as a central mechanism mediating castration-resistant prostate cancer.

A significant proportion of men report having a positive family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative (father, brother, son), which is important in that family history is one of the only established risk factors for the disease and plays a role in decision-making for prostate cancer screening. Familial aggregation of prostate cancer is considered a surrogate marker of genetic susceptibility to developing the disease, but shared environment cannot be excluded as an explanation for clustering of cases among family members. Prostate cancer is both a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease with inherited factors predicted to account for 40%-50% of cases, comprised of both rare highly to moderately penetrant gene variants, as well as common genetic variants of low penetrance. Most notably, HOXB13 and BRCA2 mutations have been consistently shown to increase prostate cancer risk, and are more commonly observed among patients diagnosed with early-onset disease. A recurrent mutation in HOXB13 has been shown to predispose to hereditary prostate cancer (HPC), and BRCA2 mutations to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also identified approximately 100 loci that associate with modest (odds ratios <2.0) increases in prostate cancer risk, only some of which have been replicated in subsequent studies. Despite these efforts, genetic testing in prostate cancer lags behind other common tumors like breast and colorectal cancer. To date, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have highly selective criteria for BRCA1/2 testing for men with prostate cancer based on personal history and/or specific family cancer history. Tumor sequencing is also leading to the identification of germline mutations in prostate cancer patients, informing the scope of inheritance.

We aimed to characterize the genomic landscape of LUAD and identify mutation signatures associated with tumor progression.  Methods and findings:   We performed an integrative genomic analysis, incorporating whole exome sequencing (WES), determination of DNA copy number and DNA methylation, and transcriptome sequencing for 101 LUAD samples from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study. We detected driver genes by testing whether the nonsynonymous mutation rate was significantly higher than the background mutation rate and replicated our findings in public datasets with 724 samples. We performed subclonality analysis for mutations based on mutant allele data and copy number alteration data. We also tested the association between mutation signatures and clinical outcomes, including distant metastasis, survival, and tumor grade. We identified and replicated two novel candidate driver genes, POU class 4 homeobox 2 (POU4F2) (mutated in 9 [8.9%] samples) and ZKSCAN1 (mutated in 6 [5.9%] samples), and characterized their major deleterious mutations. ZKSCAN1 was part of a mutually exclusive gene set that included the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway genes BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, MET, and NF1, indicating an important driver role for this gene. Moreover, we observed strong associations between methylation in specific genomic regions and somatic mutation patterns. In the tumor evolution analysis, four driver genes had a significantly lower fraction of subclonal mutations (FSM), including TP53 (p = 0.007), KEAP1 (p = 0.012), STK11 (p = 0.0076), and EGFR (p = 0.0078), suggesting a tumor initiation role for these genes. Subclonal mutations were significantly enriched in APOBEC-related signatures (p < 2.5×10-50). The total number of somatic mutations (p = 0.0039) and the fraction of transitions (p = 5.5×10-4) were associated with increased risk of distant metastasis. Our study's limitations include a small number of LUAD patients for subgroup analyses and a single-sample design for investigation of subclonality.  Conclusions:   These data provide a genomic characterization of LUAD pathogenesis and progression. The distinct clonal and subclonal mutation signatures suggest possible diverse carcinogenesis pathways for endogenous and exogenous exposures, and may serve as a foundation for more effective treatments for this lethal disease. LUAD's high heterogeneity emphasizes the need to further study this tumor type and to associate genomic findings with clinical outcomes.""","""['Jianxin Shi', 'Xing Hua', 'Bin Zhu', 'Sarangan Ravichandran', 'Mingyi Wang', 'Cu Nguyen', 'Seth A Brodie', 'Alessandro Palleschi', 'Marco Alloisio', 'Gianluca Pariscenti', 'Kristine Jones', 'Weiyin Zhou', 'Aaron J Bouk', 'Joseph Boland', 'Belynda Hicks', 'Adam Risch', 'Hunter Bennett', 'Brian T Luke', 'Lei Song', 'Jubao Duan', 'Pengyuan Liu', 'Takashi Kohno', 'Qingrong Chen', 'Daoud Meerzaman', 'Crystal Marconett', 'Ite Laird-Offringa', 'Ian Mills', 'Neil E Caporaso', 'Mitchell H Gail', 'Angela C Pesatori', 'Dario Consonni', 'Pier Alberto Bertazzi', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Maria Teresa Landi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Genomic Landscape and Immune Microenvironment Features of Preinvasive and Early Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Genomic Landscape of Atypical Adenomatous Hyperplasia Reveals Divergent Modes to Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Genome-wide DNA methylation analyses in lung adenocarcinomas: Association with EGFR, KRAS and TP53 mutation status, gene expression and prognosis.', 'Unraveling the genomic landscape of colorectal cancer through mutational signatures.', 'Advances on driver oncogenes of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'MNX1 facilitates the malignant progress of lung adenocarcinoma through transcriptionally upregulating CCDC34.', 'RNF182 induces p65 ubiquitination to affect PDL1 transcription and suppress immune evasion in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'An eleven-gene risk model associated with lymph node metastasis predicts overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Latent CSN-CRL complexes are crucial for curcumin-induced apoptosis and recruited during adipogenesis to lipid droplets via small GTPase RAB18.', 'GINS4 suppresses ferroptosis by antagonizing p53 acetylation with Snail.']"""

Among these associations (peaks) we focused our attention on those proximal to the regulatory region of HOTAIR and MALAT1. These transcripts appeared regulated by estrogens and able to control ERs function by interacting with ERα/ERβ as indicated by RNA-ChIP. Further studies performed by ChIRP revealed that in unstimulated condition, HOTAIR and MALAT1 were present on pS2, hTERT and HOTAIR promoters at the ERE/eNOS peaks. Interestingly, upon treatment with17β-estradiol HOTAIR recruitment to chromatin increased significantly while that of MALAT1 was reduced, suggesting an opposite regulation and function for these lncRNAs.

Therapeutic targeting on EN-2, however, is limited because the mechanism underlying EN-2 overexpression in prostatic cancer cells is unknown. This study was to investigate the potential regulatory role of miR-33a on EN-2 expression and explore this signaling axis in ability of prostate cancer survival and metastasis.  Methods:   The relative expression of miR-33a and EN-2 in paired prostate cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue as well as in prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, was determined using quantitative real-time PCR or western blot, respectively. Cells survival, migration and invasion were evaluated by assays of MTT, TUNEL and Boyden chamber assays, respectively. Direct regulation of EN-2 by miR-33a was examined by luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   The data showed that miR-33a was upregulated and EN-2 was downregulated in both prostate cancer tissue and prostate cancer cells. miR-33a overexpression suppresses prostate cancer cell survival and metastasis. miR-33a can directly act on EN-2 expression by binding to 3'UTR of its mRNA. Also, miR-33a negatively regulated EN-2 mRNA and protein expression. In pcDNA-EN-2 and miR-33a mimic co-transfected PC3 and DU145 cells, EN-2 overexpression reverses the anti-cell survival and metastasis actions of miR-33a overexpression. The pivotal role of miR-33a in inhibiting prostate tumor growth was confirmed in xenograft models of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that the functional interaction of miR-33a and EN-2 is involved in tumorigenesis of prostate cancer. Also in this process EN-2 serves as a negative responder for miR-33a.""","""['Q Li', 'S Lu', 'X Li', 'G Hou', 'L Yan', 'W Zhang', 'B Qiao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Copy number gain of ZEB1 mediates a double-negative feedback loop with miR-33a-5p that regulates EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer dependent on TGF-β signaling.', 'The biological functions and mechanism of miR‑212 in prostate cancer proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting Engrailed-2.', 'MiR-378 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth through downregulation of MAPK1 in vitro and in vivo.', 'MicroRNA-340 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway.', 'miR-483-5p promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting RBM5.', 'Role of germline variants in the metastasis of breast carcinomas.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'Role of microRNA-33a in malignant cells.', 'MiR-130b/TNF-α/NF-κB/VEGFA loop inhibits prostate cancer angiogenesis.', 'Copy number gain of ZEB1 mediates a double-negative feedback loop with miR-33a-5p that regulates EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer dependent on TGF-β signaling.']"""

While promising, clinical translation has been hindered by the impracticalities of using infrared transmissive substrates which are both fragile and prohibitively very expensive. Recently, glass has been proposed as a potential replacement which, although largely opaque in the infrared, allows unrestricted access to the high wavenumber region (2500-3800 cm-1). Recent studies using unstained tissue on glass have shown that despite utilising only the amide A band, good discrimination between histological classes could be achieved, and suggest the potential of discriminating between normal and malignant tissue. However unstained tissue on glass has the potential to disrupt the pathologist workflow, since it needs to be stained following infrared chemical imaging. In light of this, we report on the very first infrared Spectral Histopathology SHP study utilising coverslipped H&E stained tissue on glass using samples as received from the pathologist. In this paper we present a rigorous study using results obtained from an extended patient sample set consisting of 182 prostate tissue cores obtained from 100 different patients, on 18 separate H&E slides. Utilising a Random Forest classification model we demonstrate that we can rapidly classify four classes of histology of an independent test set with a high degree of accuracy (>90%). We investigate different degrees of staining using nine separate prostate serial sections, and demonstrate that we discriminate on biomarkers rather than the presence of the stain. Finally, using a four-class model we show that we can discriminate normal epithelium, malignant epithelium, normal stroma and cancer associated stroma with classification accuracies over 95%.""","""['Michael J Pilling', 'Alex Henderson', 'Jonathan H Shanks', 'Michael D Brown', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Peter Gardner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Using cell nuclei features to detect colon cancer tissue in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides.', 'Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'Automated annotations of epithelial cells and stroma in hematoxylin-eosin-stained whole-slide images using cytokeratin re-staining.', 'The hematoxylin and eosin stain in anatomic pathology-An often-neglected focus of quality assurance in the laboratory.', 'Hematoxylin and eosin tissue stain in Mohs micrographic surgery: a review.', 'A Current Review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models in Oral Cancer Diagnosis: Recent Technologies, Open Challenges, and Future Research Directions.', 'Applications of hyperspectral imaging in the detection and diagnosis of solid tumors.', 'A New Look into Cancer-A Review on the Contribution of Vibrational Spectroscopy on Early Diagnosis and Surgery Guidance.', 'Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in Oral Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Optimization of Sample Preparation Using Glass Slides for Spectral Pathology.']"""

Design:   A grounded theory study.  Setting:   Primary care practices in Australia and the UK.  Participants:   69 GPs in Australia (n=40) and the UK (n=29). We included GPs of varying ages, sex, clinical experience and patient populations. All GPs interested in participating in the study were included.  Results:   GPs' accounts revealed fundamental differences in whether and how prostate cancer screening occurred in their practice and in the broader context within which they operate. The history of prostate screening policy, organisational structures and funding models appeared to drive more prostate screening in Australia and less in the UK. In Australia, screening processes and decisions were mostly at the discretion of individual clinicians, and varied considerably, whereas the accounts of UK GPs clearly reflected a consistent, organisationally embedded approach based on local evidence-based recommendations to discourage screening.  Conclusions:   The GP accounts suggested that healthcare systems, including historical and current organisational and funding structures and rules, collectively contribute to how and why clinicians use the PSA test and play a significant role in creating the mindlines that GPs employ in their clinic. Australia's recently released consensus guidelines may support more streamlined and consistent care.

Methods and materials:   From March 2014 to September 2015, 10/44 consecutive patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer referred for brachytherapy presented an aggressive lesion on mpMRI and underwent an MRI-TRUS fusion-guided transperineal biopsy of the index lesion.

Currently prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration is the most used prostate cancer marker, but it only shows limited specificity. Because PSA glycosylation is altered by prostate cancer, detecting glycosylation changes could increase PSA specificity as a prostate cancer marker. Changes in PSA glycosylation can modify its electrophoretic- behavior and techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) could be applied to detect changes in PSA glycosylation. Most serum PSA is complexed with alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT). To have access to most of the PSA, the complexed PSA has to be released as free PSA (fPSA); in addition, this total fPSA must be purified from the serum matrix so that it can be analyzed using CZE. In this work a methodology for isolating PSA from serum for its CZE analysis was established. By using PSA standard, the effect of this methodology, which combines conditions for dissociating complexed PSA and immunoaffinity chromatographic purification, was studied. It was seen that this highly repeatable sample treatment did not noticeably alter the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum or the CZE pattern of PSA standard. Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the developed sample treatment was applied to serum from a cancer patient with a high PSA content. The following observations can be made from these experiments: first of all, the 2-DE pattern of serum PSA remained unchanged after sample treatment; second, as hypothesized, the established sample preparation methodology made it possible to obtain the CZE pattern of PSA from serum; and third, the CZE pattern of serum PSA and of PSA standard from seminal plasma of healthy individuals, both submitted to the sample treatment method, showed some differences regarding the proportion of CZE peaks of the glycoprotein. These differences could be related to possible changes in the linkages of peptide backbone, in glycosylation or in other post-translational modifications between samples from both origins.""","""['Noemi Farina-Gomez', 'Silvia Barrabes', 'Jorge E Gomez-Lopez', 'Monica Gonzalez', 'Angel Puerta', 'Diana Navarro-Calderon', 'Eduardo Albers-Acosta', 'Carlos Olivier', 'Jose C Diez-Masa', 'Rosa Peracaula', 'Mercedes de Frutos']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['Immunoaffinity chromatographic isolation of prostate-specific antigen from seminal plasma for capillary electrophoresis analysis of its isoforms.', 'Impact of capillary conditioning and background electrolyte composition on capillary electrophoresis analysis of prostate specific antigen isoforms.', 'Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Significance of different molecular forms of serum PSA.

However, at the population level, such patterns of cancer care are poorly described, complicating clinical research. To determine the population-based prevalence and characteristics of patients seen by multiple institutions, we used operations data from a state-mandated cancer registry.  Methods and materials:   59,672 invasive cancers diagnosed in 1/1/2010-12/31/2011 in the Greater Bay Area of northern California were categorized as having been reported to the cancer registry within 365days of diagnosis by: 1) ≥1 institution within an integrated health system (IHS); 2) IHS institution(s) and ≥1 non-IHS institution (e.g., private hospital); 3) 1 non-IHS institution; or 4) ≥2 non-IHS institutions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to characterize patients reported by multiple vs. single institutions.  Results:   Overall in this region, 17% of cancers were reported by multiple institutions. Of the 33% reported by an IHS, 8% were also reported by a non-IHS. Of non-IHS patients, 21% were reported by multiple institutions, with 28% for breast and 27% for pancreatic cancer, but 19%% for lung and 18% for prostate cancer. Generally, patients more likely to be seen by multiple institutions were younger or had more severe disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Population-based data show that one in six newly diagnosed cancer patients received care from multiple institutions, and differed from patients seen only at a single institution. Cancer care data from single institutions may be incomplete and possibly biased.""","""['Christina A Clarke', 'Sally L Glaser', 'Rita Leung', 'Kathleen Davidson-Allen', 'Scarlett L Gomez', 'Theresa H M Keegan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Active Cancer and Elevated D-Dimer Are Risk Factors for In-Hospital Ischemic Stroke.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'How do integrated health care systems address racial and ethnic disparities in colon cancer?', 'Screening prevalence and incidence of colorectal cancer among American Indian/Alaskan natives in the Indian Health Service.', 'Idiopathic hyperammonemia after solid organ transplantation: Primarily a lung problem?

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for data on liver disease etiology and dates of liver imaging tests.  Results:   Seventy-nine percent of patients reported awareness of liver cancer screening, and 50% reported talking to their doctor about liver cancer. Patients with higher education, abstinence from alcohol, and liver cirrhosis were more likely to be aware of liver cancer screening (P=0.06, 0.005, <0.0001).

Here, we evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in hormone homeostasis alter the effect of pesticide exposure on prostate cancer risk. We evaluated pesticide-SNP interactions between 39 pesticides and SNPs with respect to prostate cancer among 776 cases and 1,444 controls nested in the Agricultural Health Study cohort. In these interactions, we included candidate SNPs involved in hormone synthesis, metabolism or regulation (N = 1,100), as well as SNPs associated with circulating sex steroid concentrations, as identified by genome-wide association studies (N = 17). Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative SNP-pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test. We translated p-values for interaction into q-values, which reflected the false discovery rate, to account for multiple comparisons. We observed a significant interaction, which was robust to multiple comparison testing, between the herbicide dicamba and rs8192166 in the testosterone metabolizing gene SRD5A1 (p-interaction = 4.0 × 10-5; q-value = 0.03), such that men with two copies of the wild-type genotype CC had a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with low use of dicamba (OR = 0.62 95% CI: 0.41, 0.93) and high use of dicamba (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.68), compared to those who reported no use of dicamba; in contrast, there was no significant association between dicamba and prostate cancer among those carrying one or two copies of the variant T allele at rs8192166. In addition, interactions between two organophosphate insecticides and SNPs related to estradiol metabolism were observed to result in an increased risk of prostate cancer.

Methods:   All patients with mCRPC who had experienced treatment failure with androgen-deprivation therapy and had received docetaxel chemotherapy were eligible. CTCs and EGFR expression in CTCs were enumerated with the CellSearch System in whole blood. This system is a semi-automated system that detects and enriches epithelial cells from whole blood using an EpCAM antibody-based immunomagnetic capture. In addition, the EGFR-positive CTCs were assessed using CellSearch® Tumor Phenotyping Reagent EGFR.  Results:   The median CTC count at baseline before starting trial treatment was eight CTCs per 7.5 mL of blood (range 0-184). There were 37 patients (61.7%) who had ≥5 CTCs, with median overall survival of 11.5 months compared with 20.0 months for 23 patients (38.3%) with <5 CTCs (p < 0.001).

Patients with EGFR-positive CTCs had a shorter overall survival (OS) (5.5 months) than patients with EGFR-negative CTCs (20.0 months). CTCs, EGFR-positive CTCs, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were independent predictors of overall survival time (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p = 0.017, respectively).

However, to our knowledge whether the proportion of the ductal component affects oncologic outcomes is currently unknown. We investigated whether the proportion of the ductal component predicts oncologic outcomes in ductal adenocarcinoma.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed clinical data on 3,038 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2005 and 2014. We excluded patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. Patients were stratified based on the proportion of the ductal component. We compared the probability of biochemical recurrence between groups and investigated how the proportion of the ductal component influences biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models, respectively.  Results:   Of 2,648 patients 101 (3.8%) had ductal adenocarcinoma and 2,547 (96.2%) had acinar adenocarcinoma. Freedom from biochemical recurrence in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma was significantly lower than in those with acinar adenocarcinoma (p <0.001). When ductal cases were stratified by the proportion of the ductal component, freedom from biochemical recurrence in the high ductal component group was significantly lower compared to that in the low ductal component group (30% or greater vs less than 30%, p = 0.023). On univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, a high ductal component was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (p <0.001).  Conclusions:   The prognosis for ductal adenocarcinoma can be stratified by the proportion of the ductal component.

The assay detected as few as five LNCaP95 cells spiked into peripheral blood, showing high analytical sensitivity. Multiple inter-run and intrarun replicates of LNCaP95 cell line experiments yielded similar cycle threshold values for all genes, showing high analytical precision (AR-V7 cycle threshold CV of 0.67%). All 38 healthy control samples were negative for AR-V7, showing high diagnostic specificity (100%). The diagnostic accuracy was confirmed by concurrent testing of 21 CRPC samples in the research laboratory and the clinical diagnostic laboratory: concordance in AR-V7 status was achieved in all cases (positive in 4, negative in 17) (100% accuracy).

Methods:   In all patients, GTV was defined with mpMRI, and deformably registered onto post-catheter insertion planning MRI. PTV included the GTV plus 9mm craniocaudal and 5mm in every other direction. In discovery-cohort, plans were obtained for each PTV independently aiming to deliver ⩾16.5Gy/fraction (two fraction schedule) while respecting predefined organs-at-risk (OAR) constraints or halted when achieved equivalent single-dose plan (24Gy). Dosimetric results of original and focal HDR-BT plans were evaluated to develop a planning protocol for the validation-cohort.  Results:   In discovery-cohort (20-patients, 32-GTVs): PTV D95% ⩾16.5Gy could not be reached in a single plan (3%) and was accomplished (range 16.5-23.8Gy) in 15 GTVs (47%). Single-dose schedule was feasible in 16 (50%) plans. In the validation-cohort (10-patients, 10-GTVs, two separate implants each): plans met acceptable and ideal criteria in 100% and 43-100% respectively. Migration to single-dose treatment schedule was feasible in 7 implants (35%), without relaxing OAR's constraints or increasing the dose (D100% and D35%) to mpMRI-normal prostate (p>0.05).

Here, we investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression changes in murine prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts using two different diets: HFD and control diet. We then assessed the roles and targets of altered miRNAs in HFD-induced PCa progression. We identified 38 up- and 21 downregulated miRNAs in xenografts under HFD conditions using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA array. The differences in 10 candidate miRNAs were validated using quantitative RT-PCR. We focused on miR-130a because the expression levels were significantly lower in the three PCa cell lines in comparison with benign prostate PINT1B cells. PCa cells cultured in a medium containing HFD mouse serum were associated with significantly higher cell proliferation rates and lower miR-130a expression levels. Further, miR-130a modulated MET expression in PCa cells, and MET was overexpressed in in vitro and in vivo HFD-induced PCa progression models. Moreover, ectopic miR-130a downregulated AR in LNCaP cells and DICER1 in PC-3 and DU145 cells, respectively. In human tissues, as elucidated using laser capture microdissection, the mean miR-130a expression level in cancer epithelium was significantly lower than that in normal epithelium. Furthermore, cytoplasmic MET in PCa tissues was overexpressed in patients with higher body mass index. In conclusion, a substantial number of miRNAs was altered in HFD-induced PCa growth. Specifically, miR-130a was attenuated in HFD-induced PCa progression with MET overexpression. miRNAs thus have implications in the mechanism, prevention and treatment of HFD-induced PCa progression.""","""['Taketoshi Nara', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Huang Mingguo', 'Toshiaki Yoshioka', 'Atsushi Koizumi', 'Kazuyuki Numakura', 'Hiroshi Tsuruta', 'Atsushi Maeno', 'Mitsuru Saito', 'Takamitsu Inoue', 'Norihiko Tsuchiya', 'Shigeru Satoh', 'Tomonori Habuchi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Activin A regulates microRNAs and gene expression in LNCaP cells.', 'Epigenetic disruption of miR-130a promotes prostate cancer by targeting SEC23B and DEPDC1.', 'MicroRNA alteration and putative target genes in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer: STAT3 and ZEB1 are upregulated during prostate carcinogenesis.', 'miRNAs as novel biomarkers in the management of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA expression and function in prostate cancer: a review of current knowledge and opportunities for discovery.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Upregulation of polycistronic microRNA-143 and microRNA-145 in colonocytes suppresses colitis and inflammation-associated colon cancer.', 'Adipose tissue from metabolic syndrome mice induces an aberrant miRNA signature highly relevant in prostate cancer development.', 'MicroRNAs and Long Non-coding RNAs in c-Met-Regulated Cancers.', 'Increased fatty acyl saturation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates in prostate cancer progression.']"""

Here, 67Ga is compared with Auger electron emitter 111In as a potential therapeutic radionuclide.  Methods:   Plasmid pBR322 studies allowed direct comparison between 67Ga and 111In (1MBq) in causing DNA damage, including the effect of chelators (EDTA and DTPA) and the effects of a free radical scavenger (DMSO). The cytotoxicity of internalized (by means of delivery in the form of oxine complexes) and non-internalized 67Ga and 111In was measured in DU145 prostate cancer cells after a one-hour incubation using cell viability (trypan blue) and clonogenic studies. MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 cells were also used.  Results:   Plasmid DNA damage was caused by 67Ga and was comparable to that caused by 111In; it was reduced in the presence of EDTA, DTPA and DMSO. The A50 values (internalized activity of oxine complexes per cell required to kill 50% of cells) as determined by trypan blue staining was 1.0Bq/cell for both 67Ga and 111In; the A50 values determined by clonogenic assay were 0.7Bq/cell and 0.3Bq/cell for 111In and 67Ga respectively. At the concentrations required to achieve these uptake levels, non-internalized 67Ga and 111In caused no cellular toxicity. Qualitatively similar results were found for MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 cells.  Conclusion: 67Ga causes as much damage as 111In to plasmid DNA in solution and shows similar toxicity as 111In at equivalent internalized activity per cell. 67Ga therefore deserves further evaluation for radionuclide therapy.  Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care:   The data presented here is at the basic level of science.

If fact, most current guidelines suggest that males over the age of 50 years should undergo prostate cancer screening. However, the clinical behavior and prognosis of prostate cancer in young adults is not well defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical behavior, pathological characteristics, and prognosis of prostate cancer in young adults.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of young patients (age, ≤50 years) in our hospital with prostate adenocarcinoma between 1997 and 2013. We compared data including initial presentation, cancer cell type, Gleason score, disease stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volume, treatment, and survival between patients both younger and older than 50 years. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to assess survival.  Results:   Twenty-six patients were enrolled in our study, accounting for 0.55% of all patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer at our facility. All 26 patients had a pathology diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, with a mean age on diagnosis of 46.8±2.8 years (range, 39-50 years). On initial presentation, patients older than 50 years more frequently displayed lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) than younger patients (62.3% vs. 30.4%, p=0.008). There was no statistical difference in histological grade, disease stage, PSA level, overall survival, and biochemical-free survival between the two groups.  Conclusion:   The result of our investigation indicated that prostate adenocarcinoma patients younger than 50 years had similar histological grade, disease stage, PSA level, overall survival, and biochemical-free survival as the older population. However, patients younger than 50 years with prostate cancer less frequently showed initial symptoms of LUTS.""","""['Tzu-Hao Huang', 'Junne-Yih Kuo', 'Yi-Hsiu Huang', 'Hsiao-Jen Chung', 'William J S Huang', 'Howard H H Wu', 'Yen-Hwa Chang', 'Alex T L Lin', 'Kuang-Kuo Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Chin Med Assoc""","""['Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'Stage at presentation and survival outcomes of patients with Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer and low prostate-specific antigen.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'The natural history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: Future Directions for Translational Science.', 'Prostate cancers in men under the age of 50: about a series in Togo, Sub-Saharan Africa.', 'microRNA Expression Profiling in Young Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Pathological Characteristics of Prostate Cancer in Men Aged < 50 Years Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: a Multi-Centre Study in Korea.', 'Markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition reflect tumor biology according to patient age and Gleason score in prostate cancer.']"""

In prostate cancer (PCa), the second most common male malignancy worldwide, the amount of reactive stroma is variable and has predictive value for tumor recurrence. By analyzing human PCa protein and RNA expression databases, we found smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are decreased in advanced tumors, whereas fibroblasts are maintained. In three mouse models of PCa, PB-MYC, ERG/PTEN and TRAMP, we found the composition of the stroma is distinct. SMCs are greatly depleted in advanced PB-MYC tumors and locally reduced in ERG/PTEN prostates, whereas in TRAMP tumors the SMC layers are increased. In addition, interductal fibroblast-like cells expand in PB-MYC and ERG/PTEN tumors, whereas in TRAMP PCa they expand little and stromal cells invade into intraductal adenomas. Fate mapping of SMCs showed that in PB-MYC tumors the cells are depleted, whereas they expand in TRAMP tumors and interestingly contribute to the stromal cells in intraductal adenomas. Hedgehog (HH) ligands secreted by epithelial cells are known to regulate prostate mesenchyme expansion differentially during development and regeneration. Any possible role of HH signaling in stromal cells during PCa progression is poorly understood. We found that HH signaling is high in SMCs and fibroblasts near tumor cells in all models, and epithelial Shh expression is decreased whereas Ihh and Dhh are increased. In human primary PCa, expression of IHH is the highest of the three HH genes, and elevated HH signaling correlates with high stromal gene expression. Moreover, increasing HH signaling in the stroma of PB-MYC PCa resulted in more intact SMC layers and decreased tumor progression (micro-invasive carcinoma). Thus, we propose HH signaling restrains tumor progression by maintaining the smooth muscle and preventing invasion by tumor cells. Our studies highlight the importance of understanding how HH signaling and stromal composition impact on PCa to optimize drug treatments.""","""['Zhaohui Yang', 'Yu-Ching Peng', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Dong Gao', 'Yu Chen', 'Alexandra L Joyner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Dis Model Mech""","""['Comparative expression of Hedgehog ligands at different stages of prostate carcinoma progression.', 'Sonic hedgehog and androgen signaling in tumor and stromal compartments drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal Indian hedgehog signaling is required for intestinal adenoma formation in mice.', 'Cellular Constituents of the Prostate Stroma: Key Contributors to Prostate Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance.', 'Hedgehog signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in various types of cancer.', 'The emerging roles of Hedgehog signaling in tumor immune microenvironment.', 'Cellular and molecular mechanisms of Hedgehog signalling.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: The chief architect in the tumor microenvironment.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts: recent advances and future perspectives.']"""

Here, a new photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing platform has been established based on the signal amplification of click chemistry (CC) via hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for highly sensitive microRNA (miRNA) assay. In this proposal, a preferred electron donor dopamine (DA) was first assembled with designed ligation probe (probe-N3) via amidation reaction to achieve DA-coordinated signal probe (PDA-N3). The PDA-N3 served as a flexible trigger to signal amplification through efficiently suppressing the electron-hole recombinant. Specifically, the PDA-N3 can be successfully ligated into the trapped hairpins (H1 and H2) via the superior ligation method of metal-catalyst-free CC, in which the electron donor DA was introduced into the assay system. Moreover, the enzyme-free HCR, employed as a versatile amplification way, ensures that lots of PDA-N3 can be attached to the substrate.

We assessed in-hospital outcomes of all radical prostatectomies in Germany from 2006 to 2013 focusing on caseload volume, surgical approach, and certification status.  Methods:   We analyzed the nationwide German hospital billing data covering 221,331 radical prostatectomies from 2006 to 2013. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, surgical revision, and transfusion rates and the length of stay. Multivariate models described the impact of these factors.  Results:   The yearly number of radical prostatectomies declined from 28,374 to 21,850. While shares of all other approaches decreased, shares for robot-assisted prostatectomy increased from 0.6 to 25.2%. Hospitals with ≥100 cases a year reported lower in-hospital mortality with 0.08 versus 0.17% for hospitals with <50 cases a year. On multivariate analysis, the odds for an individual death were doubled in hospitals with <50 cases a year. All other factors showed no significant impact on mortality. Concerning blood transfusion, the surgical approach was the strongest predictor with minimally invasive surgery (26% of the odds of conventional surgery) followed by caseload volume. Surgical revision was frequent in hospitals with lower rates of minimally invasive approaches (OR 1.6) and smaller caseloads (OR 1.4). Length of stay was reduced by 3 days for caseloads ≥200 a year, 2 days with minimally invasive approaches, and 1 day in certified prostate cancer centers. Lacking clinical information is a major limitation.  Conclusions:   Annual caseload volume of hospitals is the most important factor for improved in-hospital outcomes.""","""['Christer Groeben', 'Rainer Koch', 'Martin Baunacke', 'Manfred P Wirth', 'Johannes Huber']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Re: High Volume is the Key for Improving In-Hospital Outcomes after Radical Prostatectomy: A Total Population Analysis in Germany from 2006 to 2013.', 'Robots drive the German radical prostatectomy market: a total population analysis from 2006 to 2013.', 'Associations between Hospital Volume and Outcomes of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Systematic Review of the Volume-Outcome Relationship for Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after open and minimally invasive prostate cancer surgery: experience from Australasia.', 'A Systematic Review of the Impact of Surgeon and Hospital Caseload Volume on Oncological and Nononcological Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Does the Identification of a Minimum Number of Cases Correlate With Better Adherence to International Guidelines Regarding the Treatment of Penile Cancer?

Early diagnosis of prostate cancer in Asia is by an opportunistic case-finding approach, that is, offering prostate-specific antigen testing to an individual without obvious symptoms of prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the mode of presentation and the characteristics of prostate cancers diagnosed in our hospital.  Methods:   We recruited 120 consecutive Chinese patients with prostate cancer newly diagnosed from September 2011 to February 2013 in a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Patient demographics, symptoms, presentation, staging, and risk profiles were collected and analysed.  Results:   The number of subjects diagnosed during a health check (group 1), investigated for symptoms with no/low suspicion of prostate cancer (group 2), investigated for symptoms where prostate cancer was suspected (group 3), or who had undergone transurethral prostatectomy (group 4) were 12 (10.0%), 53 (44.2%), 46 (38.3%), and nine (7.5%), respectively. Overall mean age was 71.0 (range, 54-90) years, and patients in group 3 were significantly older than those in groups 1 and 2 (P<0.001). Patients in group 3 had a significantly higher level of serum prostate-specific antigen, higher incidence of abnormal digital rectal examination, and more metastatic disease at presentation than the other groups. Nonetheless, more than 50% of the prostate cancers in groups 1 and 2 were of intermediate risk or higher staging at presentation. After a median follow-up of 32 months, cancer-specific survival was 100% for each of groups 1, 2, and 4 but was only 76.8% for group 3 (P=0.006).  Conclusions:   Patients with prostate cancer who presented with prostate cancer-related symptoms had more metastatic disease and poorer survival than patients diagnosed by a case-finding approach. Moreover, more than half of those patients diagnosed by case finding belonged to intermediate- or higher-risk groups for which active treatment was recommended.""","""['S Ys Chan', 'C F Ng', 'K Wm Lee', 'C H Yee', 'P Kf Chiu', 'J Yc Teoh', 'S Sm Hou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hong Kong Med J""","""['Obesity and oncological outcome after radical prostatectomy: impact of prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital and Duke Prostate Center databases.', 'Early diagnosis of prostate cancer in the Western Cape.', 'The role of urine prostate cancer antigen 3 mRNA levels in the diagnosis of prostate cancer among Hong Kong Chinese patients.', 'Is routine digital rectal examination required for the followup of prostate cancer?', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Prostate cancer management in the era of COVID-19: Recommendations from the Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-oncology.']"""

Measuring the variability in normal-organ uptake of 18F-DCFPyL is necessary to understand its biodistribution, aid image interpretation, judge the reliability of scan quantification, and provide a basis for therapeutic monitoring. Methods: Sixty-five consecutive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans from 64 patients with a history of prostate cancer were analyzed. Volumes of interest were defined for the lacrimal glands, major salivary glands, liver, spleen, and both kidneys. The mean SUV normalized to body mass or to lean body mass (SUL) was calculated for each volume of interest. The average SUV across all scans, the SD, and the coefficient of variation (COV) for each organ were calculated. The same parameters were also derived for a 3-cm sphere drawn in the center of the right lobe of the liver. Results: The average SUVmean for all selected organs measured was 6.6 ± 1.8 for the right lacrimal gland, 6.4 ± 1.8 for the left lacrimal gland, 9.1 ± 2.0 for the right parotid gland, 9.0 ± 2.1 for the left parotid gland, 9.6 ± 2.3 for the right submandibular gland, 9.4 ± 2.2 for the left submandibular gland, 5.0 ± 0.7 for the whole liver, 5.1 ± 0.7 for a 3-cm sphere in the liver, 4.0 ± 1.5 for the spleen, 20.1 ± 4.6 for the right kidney, and 19.4 ± 4.5 for the left kidney. SULmean was lower overall, although demonstrating similar trends. The COV of SUVmean and SULmean was lower in the liver (13.8% and 14.5%, respectively) than in any other organ and was less than the comparable COV for 18F-FDG PET. The COV of SUVmean and SULmean in the 3-cm sphere in the liver was also low and similar to the variability in the whole liver (14.2% and 14.7%, respectively). Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL uptake in normal liver demonstrates less variability than in other 18F-DCFPyL-avid organs, and its variability is less than the reported variability of 18F-FDG in liver. Variability was slightly less for SUVmean than for SULmean, suggesting that SUVmean may be the preferable parameter for quantification of images obtained with 18F-DCFPyL.""","""['Xin Li', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Jeffrey P Leal', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Mohamad E Allaf', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Martin A Lodge', 'Martin G Pomper']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Semiquantitative Parameters in PSMA-Targeted PET Imaging with 18FDCFPyL: Impact of Tumor Burden on Normal Organ Uptake.', 'Semiquantitative Parameters in PSMA-Targeted PET Imaging with 18FDCFPyL: Intrapatient and Interpatient Variability of Normal Organ Uptake.', 'Uptake of the prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted PET radiotracer 18F-DCFPyL in elastofibroma dorsi.', 'Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Using 18FDCFPyL.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Standardised uptake values as determined on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography is associated with oncological outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) fusion imaging in prostate cancer: PET-CT vs PET-MRI.', 'Is SUV Corrected for Lean Body Mass Superior to SUV of Body Weight in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT?', 'The effect of eating on the uptake of PSMA ligands in the salivary glands.', 'Intra-patient comparison of physiologic 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT uptake in ganglia in prostate cancer patients: a pictorial essay.']"""

Methods:   A 73-year-old man with chronic renal failure underwent living-donor kidney transplantation (KT) in 1993. His baseline creatinine after KT was ∼1.2 mg/dL. He developed lower urinary tract symptoms in 1999. He was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and treated accordingly. He was followed regularly with the use of digital rectal examination and measurement of serum prostatic-specific antigen (PSA). In 2014, his serum PSA was 11.53 ng/mL. Prostate biopsy was done and revealed localized prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3+4). We performed robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with the use of the Retzius space preservation technique.  Results:   The patient underwent successful robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy without any complications. The operative time was 210 minutes with estimated blood loss of 250 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on the 6th day after surgery with a retained Foley catheter. A cystogram was done on the 13th day after surgery and showed no urethrovesical anastomosis leakage. After Foley catheter removal, the patient could urinate normally without urinary incontinence. Pathologic analysis revealed positive surgical margin with no extraprostatic extension and no seminal vesical invasion. One month after the operation, PSA was 0.08 ng/mL and renal function remained stable.  Conclusions:   Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is technically feasible and safe for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the renal transplant patient. The Retzius space preservation technique is helpful in minimizing the manipulation of transplanted kidney and urinary bladder during the operation, resulting in favorable postoperative renal function and continence outcome.""","""['P Jenjitranant', 'P Sangkum', 'P Sirisreetreerux', 'W Viseshsindh', 'S Patcharatrakul', 'W Kongcharoensombat']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a cadaveric renal transplant patient: first case in Thailand and the authors first experience--a case report.', 'Applicability of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in renal allograft recipients.', 'A direct comparison of robotic assisted versus pure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single institution experience.', 'Histopathologic outcomes of robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Radical prostatectomy outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a retrospective case series of Thai patients.', 'Pelvic Surgery in the Transplant Recipient: Important Considerations for the Non-transplant Surgeon.', 'Is Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy associated with better functional and oncological outcomes?

They can be regulated by the Low density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 1 (LRP-1), a receptor reported to mediate the clearance of lipoproteins, extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules and proteinases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of LRP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 across various grades of prostatic diseases as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), BPH plus prostatitis (BPH+P), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   LRP-1 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and MMPs proteolytic activity by zymography in prostate tissues with different prostatic diseases.  Results:   LRP-1 was detected in epithelial cells in BPH (16/18), BPH+P (21/21) and HGPIN (6/6), with a staining intensity of 1+, 1+/2+ and 3+, respectively. In PCa, LRP-1 was absent in 19/27 samples while a low expression was observed in 8/27 biopsies. MMP-9 activity was higher and statistically significant in PCa than in BPH (p≤0.01).

Moreover, the high recurrence rate and poor clinical response to chemotherapy and radiation treatment further underscores that the non-cancerous cells of the microenvironment, such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and pericytes, may be important in the pathophysiology of HNSCC.  Methods:   Confocal microscopy and immunohistomchemistry approaches were used to identify MSCs tumor microenvironment from patients with oral cavity and oral pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In vitro Boyden chamber assays and multiplex magnetic bead assays were used to measure MSC chemotaxis and to identify the chemokines secreted by JHU-011, -012, -019, three cells lines derived from patients with oral pharyngeal SCC.  Results:   We show here that MSCs reside in the tumor microenvironment of patients with oral cavity and oral pharyngeal SCC and are recruited via paracrine mediated tumor cell secretion of (platelet derived growth factor) PDGF-AA. The MSC markers CD90+, CD105+, and gremlin-1+ were found to co-localize on cells within the tumor microenvironment in oral cavity SCC specimens distinct from α-smooth muscle actin staining CAFs. The conditioned media from JHU-011, -012, and -019 caused a significant increase in MSC migration (>60%) and invasion (>50%; p < 0.0001) compared to oral keratinocyte (OKT) controls. Tumor cell induced MSC chemotaxis appears to be mediated through paracrine secretion of PDGF-AA as inhibition of the PDGF-AA receptor, PDGFR-α but not PDGFR-β, resulted in near arrest of MSC chemotaxis (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Tumor microenvironment expression of PDGFR-α has been shown to correlate with a worse prognosis in patients with prostate, breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer and osteosarcoma. This is the first evidence that a similar signaling paradigm may be present in HNSCC. PDGFR-α inhibitors have not been studied as adjunctive treatment options in the management of HNSCC and may prove to be an important driver of the malignant phenotype in this setting.""","""['Tammara L Watts', 'Ruwen Cui', 'Peter Szaniszlo', 'Vicente A Resto', 'Don W Powell', 'Irina V Pinchuk']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Roles of mesenchymal stromal cells in the head and neck cancer microenvironment.', 'The paracrine effect of cancer-associated fibroblast-induced interleukin-33 regulates the invasiveness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Adenosine metabolism of human mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The bidirectional tumor--mesenchymal stromal cell interaction promotes the progression of head and neck cancer.', 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: a potential driver and biomarker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: opportunities and challenges.', 'Methotrexate and Cetuximab-Biological Impact on Non-Tumorigenic Models: In Vitro and In Ovo Assessments.', 'Roles of mesenchymal stromal cells in the head and neck cancer microenvironment.', 'Drug resistance against 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A systematic review.', 'The role of PDGFRA as a therapeutic target in young colorectal cancer patients.']"""

Health care resource use (HCRU), including hospitalisation events and days, were prospectively collected in ALSYMPCA. We assessed health care resource use for the first 12 months post-randomisation. Significantly fewer radium-223 (218/589; 37.0%) versus placebo patients (133/292; 45.5%) had at least one hospitalisation event (P = 0.016). However, mean number of hospitalisation events per patient was similar (radium-223 0.69 versus placebo 0.79, P = 0.226), likely due to the significantly longer follow-up time for radium-223 (7.82 months versus 6.92 months for placebo; P < 0.001).

Age- and gender-matched insured individuals (n = 213,660) found in the health service records over the same period were recruited as the control group. The Cox proportional hazards model and competing risks regression model were used to examine the relationship between urolithiasis and UTC, as well as whether early intervention for urolithiasis decreased the subsequent cancer risk relative to late intervention.Participants with a previous diagnosis of urolithiasis (n = 695) had a 1.82-fold (95% CI: 1.66-1.99, P < 0.001) increased risk of developing UTC. Furthermore, the risk of UTC associated with urolithiasis was higher in women (adjusted HR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.94-3.05) than in men (adjusted HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.55-1.90). When stratified by cancer site, the adjusted HR for bladder, renal pelvis/ureter, renal, and prostate cancers were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.62-2.33), 2.94 (95% CI: 2.24-3.87), 2.94 (95% CI: 2.29-3.77), and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.27-1.65), respectively. Patients who received interventions for urolithiasis within 3 months of detection had a decreased risk of subsequent UTC (adjusted HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.40-0.71, P < 0.001).The present study demonstrated that urolithiasis increased the risk of subsequent UTC, especially upper UTC.

Materials and Methods Twenty-five common flexor tendons were evaluated in 16 fresh, unembalmed cadavers of 11 women with a median age of 85 years (range, 71-101 years) and five men with a median age of 78 years (range, 70-88 years). Informed consent was provided according to the last will of the donors. B-mode US results were classified as grade 1, normal tendon with homogeneous fibrillar pattern; grade 2, tendon thickening or hypoechoic areas and/or calcifications in less than 30% of the tendon; or grade 3, hypoechoic areas and/or calcifications greater than 30% of the tendon. Sonoelastographic results were grade 1, blue (hardest) to green (hard); grade 2, yellow (soft); and grade 3, red (softest). The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to determine agreement with histologic findings for each B-mode US, sonoelastographic, and combined B-mode US and sonoelastographic examination. Histologic results were grade 1, normal, with parallel fibrillar pattern; grade 2, mild tendinopathy, with cellular infiltration, angiogenesis, or fatty vacuoles; or grade 3, severe tendinopathy, with loss of parallel collagen structure and necrosis. Results Histologic alterations were detected in 44% (11 of 25) of biopsy specimens. Intraclass correlation with histologic results was 0.57 for B-mode US, 0.68 for sonoelastography, and 0.84 for the combination of the two approaches.

The system was used for the first time ever to measure dose during linear accelerator based SBRT. A single patient was treated with a total dose of 36.25 Gy given in 5 fractions. Delivered dose was measured for each treatment with the detectors placed against the anterior rectal wall near the prostate rectal interface. Measured doses showed varying degrees of agreement with computed/ planned doses, with average combined dose found to be within 6% of the expected dose. The variance between measurements is most likely due to uncertainty of the detector location, as well as variation in the placement of a new balloon prior to each fraction. Distance to agreement for the detectors was generally found to be within a few millimeters, which also suggested that the differences in measured and calculated doses were due to positional uncertainty of the detectors during the SBRT, which had sharp dose falloff near the penumbra along the rectal wall. Overall, the use of a real time in vivo dosimeter provided a level of safety and improved confidence in treatment delivery.

Microsoft (MS) Visual Studio Coded UI is applied to record some common planner-TPS interactions as subroutines. The TPS used in this study is a Windows-based Eclipse system. The interactions of our application program with Eclipse TPS are realized through a series of subrou-tines obtained by prerecording the mouse clicks or keyboard strokes of a planner in operating the TPS. A strategy to autopilot Eclipse VMAT/IMRT plan selection process is developed as a specific example of the proposed ""scripting"" method. The autopiloted planning is navigated by a decision function constructed with a reference plan that has the same prescription and similar anatomy with the case at hand. The calculation proceeds by alternating between the Eclipse optimization and the outer-loop optimization independent of the Eclipse. In the C# program, the dosimetric characteristics of a reference treatment plan are used to assess and modify the Eclipse planning parameters and to guide the search for a clinically sensible treatment plan. The approach is applied to plan a head and neck (HN) VMAT case and a prostate IMRT case. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of application programming method in C# environment with recorded interactions of planner-TPS. The process mimics a planner's planning process and automatically provides clinically sensible treatment plans that would otherwise require a large amount of manual trial and error of a planner. The proposed technique enables us to harness a commercial TPS by application programming via the use of recorded human computer interactions and provides an effective tool to greatly facilitate the treatment planning process.""","""['Henry Wang', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Development of an autonomous treatment planning strategy for radiation therapy with effective use of population-based prior data.', 'Using overlap volume histogram and IMRT plan data to guide and automate VMAT planning: a head-and-neck case study.', 'The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'The application of artificial intelligence in the IMRT planning process for head and neck cancer.', 'Automated treatment planning for liver cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'A plan template-based automation solution using a commercial treatment planning system.', 'Automated Field-In-Field (FIF) Plan Framework Combining Scripting Application Programming Interface and User-Executed Program for Breast Forward IMRT.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.']"""

Bladder and rectum volumetric doses were calculated and cor-related to the daily bladder and rectum fullness. Patients for this study underwent hypofractionated prostate IMRT to 70 Gy in 28 fractions. Daily CBCT was utilized for image guidance. A clinically acceptable plan was created using a CTV-to-PTV uniform margin of 5 mm. Image fusion was performed to transfer the bladder and rectum contours onto each CBCT. Contours were then edited to match the anatomy of each CBCT. Using the daily treatment isocenter, the planned beams were transferred onto the CBCT and daily and cumulative DVHs calculated. For the results a total of 168 daily CBCTs were evaluated. The bladder was found to be smaller for 74.7% of the 168 daily CBCTs accessed in this study. This reduction in volume correlated to an increase in the cumulative bladder V70 Gy from 9.47% on the planning CT to 10.99% during treatment. V70Gy for the rectum was 7.27% on the planning CT, when all six patients were averaged, and increased to 11.56% on the average of all daily treatment CBCTs. Increases in volumetric rectum dose correlated with increases in rectal volume. For one patient, the rectum and blad-der absolute V70 Gy, averaged over the course of treatment, increased by 295% and 61%, respectively. Larger variations in the daily bladder and rectal volume were observed and these correlated to large deviations from the volumetric dose received by these structures. In summary, bladder and rectum volume changes during treatment have an effect on the cumulative dose received by these organs. It was observed that the volumetric dose received by the bladder decreases as the volume of the bladder increases. The inverse was true for the rectum.""","""['David Pearson', 'Sukhdeep K Gill', 'Nina Campbell', 'Krishna Reddy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Determination of optimal PTV margin for patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: comparative analysis based on CBCT dose calculation with four different margins.', 'Associations between volume changes and spatial dose metrics for the urinary bladder during local versus pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Magnetic resonance guided SBRT reirradiation in locally recurrent prostate cancer: a multicentric retrospective analysis.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Dosimetric impacts of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based anatomic changes in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Predictive modelling for late rectal and urinary toxicities after prostate radiotherapy using planned and delivered dose.', 'Dose-volume analysis of planned versus accumulated dose as a predictor for late gastrointestinal toxicity in men receiving radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic effect of CTC andto elucidate whether the detection of CTC in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients diagnosed with CRPC can beused as an independent prognostic factor for survival.  Materials and methods:   The Pubmed, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Database, Embase Cell Research databaseand the references in relevant studies were systematically searched. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival(OS) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression analysis waspooled and publication bias were conducted.  Results:   Ten eligible studies enrolling 1206 patients were identified for final analysis. To decrease the heterogeneityof this meta-analysis we excluded two studies after sensitivity analysis. Remained eight studies were enrolledin the pooled analysis and the result revealed that CTC positivity (presence of 5 or more CTCs per 7.5mL PB) wassignificantly associated with a poor OS (HR = 2.76, 95%CI: 2.28-3.34, P < .0001).

Methods:   Each of the 7 patients had three fiducial markers implanted into the prostate before treatment. Prostate positioning was simultaneously measured by 3DUS and CBCT before each fraction. In total, 177 pairs of 3DUS and CBCT scans were collected. Bone-match and seed-match were performed for each CBCT. Using seed-match as a reference, the accuracy of 3DUS and bone-match was evaluated. Systematic and random errors as well as optimal setup margins were calculated for 3DUS and bone-match.  Results:   The discrepancy between 3DUS and seed-match in CBCT (average ± standard deviation) was 0.0 ± 1.7 mm laterally, 0.2 ± 2.0 mm longitudinally, and 0.3 ± 1.7 mm vertically. Using seed-match as a reference, systematic errors for 3DUS were 1.2 mm, 1.1 mm, and 0.9 mm; and random errors were 1.4 mm, 1.8 mm, and 1.6 mm, on lateral, longitudinal, and vertical axes, respectively. By analogy, the difference of bone-match to seed-match was 0.1 ± 1.1 mm laterally, 1.3 ± 3.8 mm longitudinally, and 1.3 ± 4.5 mm vertically. Systematic errors were 0.5 mm, 2.2 mm, and 2.6 mm; and random errors were 1.0 mm, 3.1 mm, and 3.9 mm on lateral, longitudinal, and vertical axes, respectively. The accuracy of 3DUS was significantly higher than that of bone-match on longitudinal and vertical axes, but not on the lateral axis.  Conclusion:   Image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer based on transperineal 3DUS was feasible, with overall small discrepancy to seed-match in CBCT in this retrospective study.

A retrospective database was created to evaluate patient demographics, presentation, diagnostic procedures, operative interventions, outcomes, and complications. Comparisons between men who underwent cystectomy versus bladder-sparing surgeries were performed.  Results:   At a median age of 73 (interquartile range (IQR) 68.5, 79) years, presenting symptoms included as follows: pubic pain (19/31, 61%), urine drainage via fistula (10/31, 32%), or a superficial wound infection (6/31, 19%). Recent instrumentation prior to diagnosis of anterior urinary fistula was reported by 18/31 (58%) at a median of 14.9 months (IQR 7.9, 103.8) after manipulation.

Methods and analysis:   Postal surveys will be sent to prostate cancer survivors (18-42 months postdiagnosis) in all 4 UK countries (n=∼70 000). Eligible men will be identified and/or verified through cancer registration systems. Men will be surveyed twice, 12 months apart, to explore changes in outcomes over time. Second, separate cohorts will be surveyed once and the design will include evaluation of the acceptability of online survey tools. A comprehensive patient-reported outcome measure has been developed using generic and specific instruments with proven psychometric properties and relevance in national and international studies. The outcome data will be linked with administrative health data (eg, treatment information from hospital data).

Cases were 394 individuals with incident, histologically confirmed PC, who were matched by age (±5 years) with 794 population controls. Dietary information was obtained through a semi-quantitative FFQ with a 3-year frame of reference before diagnosis, for cases, or interview, for controls. On the basis of twenty-eight food parameters, we estimated the energy-adjusted DII (E-DII). According to the Gleason score at diagnosis, PC cases were categorised as high (≥8), moderate (=7) and low (≤6) PC risk. Independent, unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate PC risk and PC aggressiveness.

Secondarily, to identify possible prognostic variables associated with mpMRI and 18F-CH PET/CT findings.  Methods:   Retrospective study of 38 patients who developed biochemical recurrence after RP between the years 2011 and 2015 at our institution. PET/CT and mpMRI were both performed within 30 days of each other in all patients. The PET/CT was reviewed by a nuclear medicine specialist while the mpMRI was assessed by a radiologist, both of whom were blinded to outcomes.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value pre-MRI/PET-CT was 0.9 ng/mL (interquartile range 0.4-2.2 ng/mL). There were no differences in the detection rate between 18F-CH PET/CT and mpMRI for local recurrence (LR), lymph node recurrence (LNR) and bone metastases (BM). Separately, mpMRI and 18F-CH PET/CT were positive for recurrence in 55.2% and 52.6% of cases, respectively, and in 65.7% of cases when findings from both modalities were considered together. The detection of LR was better with combined mpMRI and choline PET/CT versus choline PET/CT alone (34.2% vs 18.4%, p = 0.04). Salvage treatment was modified in 22 patients (57.8%) based on the imaging findings. PSA values on the day of biochemical failure were significantly associated with mpMRI positivity (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 30.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-635.8). Gleason score > 7 was significantly associated with PET/CT positivity (OR: 13.9; 95% CI: 1.5-125.6).

Conclusions:   Multiparametric MRI and 18F-CH PET/CT yield similar detection rates for LR, LNR and pelvic BM. The combination of both imaging techniques provides a better LR detection versus choline PET/CT alone.

This study investigates anti-cancer effects of SH003 in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   SH003 extract in 30% ethanol was used to treat the prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3. Cell viability was determined by MTT and BrdU incorporation assays. Next, apoptotic cell death was determined by Annexin V and 7-AAD double staining methods. Western blotting was conducted to measure protein expression levels of components of cell death and signaling pathways. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using H2DCF-DA. Plasmid-mediated ERK2 overexpression in DU145 cells was used to examine the effect of rescuing ERK2 function. Results were analyzed using the Student's t-test and P-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically-significant differences.  Results:   Our data demonstrate that SH003 induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK signaling. SH003 induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in dose-dependent manner, which was independent of androgen dependency. SH003 also increased intracellular ROS levels but this is not associated with its pro-apoptotic effects. SH003 inhibited phosphorylation of Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK/p90RSK in androgen-independent DU145 cells, but not androgen-dependent LNCaP and PC-3 cells.

MAO inhibitors are also under investigation for the treatment of disorders ranging from Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer and certain cardiomyopathies. While a number of irreversible MAO inhibitors are available in the clinic, reversible inhibitors, particularly of the MAO-B isoform are still being developed. Based on our interest in discovering reversible inhibitors with specificity for MAO-B, we have recently reported that, among a series of 10 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone derivatives, are high potency MAO-B inhibitors, with a number of homologues displaying good selectivities for MAO-B over the MAO-A isoform. Methods and Findings: To expand on these promising findings and to derive structure-activity relationships, the current study synthesizes a series of 14 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone derivatives. An evaluation of their MAO inhibition properties shows that all derivatives are MAO-B specific with the most potent inhibitor (3a) displaying an IC50 value of 0.0014 µM. Selectivities for MAO-B ranged from 99 to 40 000-fold.

PCa under hypoxia often has resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, an effective therapy against PCa under hypoxia has not yet been established. In this report, we investigated the inhibitory effect of a redox-silent analogue of tocotrienol on the survival of a human androgen-independent PCa cell line (PC3) under hypoxia. We found that the redox-silent analogue exerted a cytotoxic effect on PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of either hypoxia or normoxia. Moreover, under hypoxia, the analogue dose dependently reduced the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α. In addition, a specific inhibitor toward HIF-1α induced cytotoxicity on PC3 cells, whereas selective inhibition of HIF-2α exerted no effect. Furthermore, suppression of HIFs levels by the analogue in hypoxic PC3 cells was closely associated with the inactivation of Fyn, a member of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family, as confirmed by the action of a specific inhibitor toward the kinase (PP2). Taken together, these results suggest that the tocotrienol analogue could inhibit the survival of PC3 cells under hypoxia, mainly by the inhibition of Fyn/HIF-1α signaling, and this may lead to the establishment of a new effective therapy for androgen-independent PCa.""","""['Nobuya Shiozawa', 'Ryosuke Sugahara', 'Kozue Namiki', 'Chiaki Sato', 'Akira Ando', 'Ayami Sato', 'Nantiga Virgona', 'Tomohiro Yano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Suppressive Effect of Delta-Tocotrienol on Hypoxia Adaptation of Prostate Cancer Stem-like Cells.', 'The role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and -2α in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Ibuprofen-mediated reduction of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in prostate cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-mediated drug resistance: novel insights on the functional interaction of HIFs and cell death pathways.', 'The transcriptional factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 and their novel inhibitors in cancer therapy.', 'Tocotrienol-rich fraction reduces retinal inflammation and angiogenesis in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.', 'Synthesis of 18FF-γ-T-3, a Redox-Silent γ-Tocotrienol (γ-T-3) Vitamin E Analogue for Image-Based In Vivo Studies of Vitamin E Biodistribution and Dynamics.', 'c-Src is required for hypoxia-induced metastasis-associated functions in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action of Tocotrienols in Cancer: Recent Trends and Advancements.', 'The association of HIF-1α expression with clinicopathological significance in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

Despite intense scrutiny, the mechanisms underlying the metastasis-suppressing role of CD82 are still not fully understood. Here, we found that a fibronectin matrix induced mesenchymal phenotypes in human prostate cancer cells with no or low CD82 expression levels. However, high CD82 expression rendered prostate cancer cells to have intensified epithelial characteristics upon fibronectin engagement, along with decreased cell motility and invasiveness. The CD82 function of inhibiting fibronectin-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was dependent not only on CD82 interactions with fibronectin-binding α3β1/α5β1 integrins but also on the integrin-mediated intracellular signaling events. Notably, CD82 attenuated the FAK-Src and ILK pathways downstream of the fibronectin-receptor integrins. Immunofluorescence staining of human prostate cancer tissue specimens illustrated a negative association of CD82 with EMT-related gene expression as well as prostate malignancy.

The different prostate cancer risks for underground coal miners in two studies with a time interval of approximately 10 yr are striking. Factors to be discussed are the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer and investigation of cases that underwent radical prostatectomy, where the disease in general is locally confined.

Mechanistic studies in this setting established that RHAMM stabilized F-actin polymerization by controlling ROCK signaling. Collectively, our findings show how RB loss drives metastatic capacity and highlight RHAMM as a candidate therapeutic target for treating advanced prostate cancer.

Maspin-deficient mouse models created to date have not definitively established maspin functions critical for cancer suppression. In this study, we generated a mouse strain in which exon 4 of the Maspin gene was deleted, confirming its essential role in development but also enabling a breeding scheme to bypass embryonic lethality. Phenotypic characterization of this viable strain established that maspin deficiency was associated with a reduction in maximum body weight and a variety of context-dependent epithelial abnormalities. Specifically, maspin-deficient mice exhibited pulmonary adenocarcinoma, myoepithelial hyperplasia of the mammary gland, hyperplasia of luminal cells of dorsolateral and anterior prostate, and atrophy of luminal cells of ventral prostate and stratum spinosum of epidermis. These cancer phenotypes were accompanied by increased inflammatory stroma. These mice also displayed the autoimmune disorder alopecia aerate.

Thus, there is a need to validate cancer-site specific survey instruments. This study aimed to perform a transcultural adaptation of the 50-item Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire for HRQoL in prostate cancer patients and to validate the psychometric properties of the French-language version.  Methods:   The EPIC questionnaire measures urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal domains. The first step, corresponding to transcultural adaptation of the original English version of the EPIC was performed according to the back translation technique. The second step, comprising the validation of the psychometric properties of the EPIC questionnaire, was performed in patients under treatment for localized prostate cancer (treatment group) and in patients cured of prostate cancer (cured group). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 prostate cancer module were also completed by patients to assess criterion validity. Two assessments were performed, i.e., before and at the end of treatment for the Treatment group, to assess sensitivity to change; and at 2 weeks' interval in the Cured group to assess test-retest reliability. Psychometric properties were explored according to classical test theory.  Results:   The first step showed overall good acceptability and understanding of the questionnaire. In the second step, 215 patients were included from January 2012 to June 2014: 125 in the Treatment group, and 90 in the Cured group. All domains exhibited good internal consistency, except the bowel domain (Cronbach's α = 0.61). No floor effect was observed. Test-retest reliability assessed in the cured group was acceptable, expect for bowel function (intraclass coefficient = 0.68). Criterion validity was good for each domain and subscale. Construct validity was not demonstrated for the hormonal and bowel domains. Sensitivity to change was exhibited for 5/8 subscales and 2/4 summary scores for patients who experienced toxicities during treatment.

The principle of 3C is to convert physical chromatin interactions into specific DNA ligation products, which are then detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, 3C-qPCR assays are often complicated by the necessity of normalization controls to correct for amplification biases. In addition, qPCR is often limited to a certain cycle number, making it difficult to detect fragment ligations with low frequency. Recently, digital PCR (dPCR) technology has become available, which allows for highly sensitive nucleic acid quantification. Main advantage of dPCR is its high precision of absolute nucleic acid quantification without requirement of normalization controls.  Results:   To demonstrate the utility of dPCR in quantifying chromatin interactions, we examined two prostate cancer risk loci at 8q24 and 2p11.2 for their interaction target genes MYC and CAPG in LNCaP cell line. We designed anchor and testing primers at known regulatory element fragments and target gene regions, respectively. dPCR results showed that interaction frequency between the regulatory element and MYC gene promoter was 0.7 (95% CI 0.40-1.10) copies per 1000 genome copies while other regions showed relatively low ligation frequencies. The dPCR results also showed that the ligation frequencies between the regulatory element and two EcoRI fragments containing CAPG gene promoter were 1.9 copies (95% CI 1.41-2.47) and 1.3 copies per 1000 genome copies (95% CI 0.76-1.92), respectively, while the interaction signals were reduced on either side of the promoter region of CAPG gene. Additionally, we observed comparable results from 3C-dPCR and 3C-qPCR at 2p11.2 in another cell line (DU145).  Conclusions:   Compared to traditional 3C-qPCR, our results show that 3C-dPCR is much simpler and more sensitive to detect weak chromatin interactions. It may eliminate multiple and complex normalization controls and provide accurate calculation of proximity-based fragment ligation frequency. Therefore, we recommend 3C-dPCR as a preferred method for sensitive detection of low frequency chromatin interactions.""","""['Meijun Du', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Mol Biol""","""['Chromatin interactions and candidate genes at ten prostate cancer risk loci.', 'Analysis of interactions between genomic loci through Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C).', 'Quantitative analysis of chromosome conformation capture assays (3C-qPCR).', 'Determining spatial chromatin organization of large genomic regions using 5C technology.', 'dPCR: A Technology Review.', 'Identification of a Locus Near ULK1 Associated With Progression-Free Survival in Ovarian Cancer.']"""

The role of Sox10 during tumorigenesis is still controversial, especially in digestive cancers; thus, we performed clinicopathological evaluation of Sox10 expression in 41 cases of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma (DGA). We examined the expression of Sox10 by immunohistochemical staining and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and evaluated the correlation between Sox10 expression and clinicopathological factors. A low-level expression of Sox10 was significantly associated with high-level venous invasion by immunohistochemical evaluation, while it was significantly associated with high-level lymphatic permeation when analyzed by real-time PCR assay. Survival analysis of 41 cases indicated that high level of vascular permeation was a statistically poor prognostic factor, suggesting that derogation of Sox10 would lead to unfavorable patients' outcome through the acceleration of vascular invasion.

KPNA4 mediates the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B, although its role in PCa was largely unknown. We find that knockdown of KPNA4 reduces cell migration in multiple PCa cell lines, suggesting a role of KPNA4 in PCa progression. Indeed, stable knockdown of KPNA4 significantly reduces PCa invasion and distant metastasis in mouse models. Functionally, KPNA4 alters tumor microenvironment in terms of macrophage polarization and osteoclastogenesis by modulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and -β. Further, KPNA4 is proved as a direct target of miR-708, a tumor-suppressive microRNA.

However, the mechanism that drives NOTCH activation in prostate cancer remains still elusive. Moreover, preclinical evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of NOTCH inhibitors in prostate cancer is lacking. Here, we provide evidence that PTEN loss in prostate tumours upregulates the expression of ADAM17, thereby activating NOTCH signalling. Using prostate conditional inactivation of both Pten and Notch1 along with preclinical trials carried out in Pten-null prostate conditional mouse models, we demonstrate that Pten-deficient prostate tumours are addicted to the NOTCH signalling. Importantly, we find that pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase promotes growth arrest in both Pten-null and Pten/Trp53-null prostate tumours by triggering cellular senescence. Altogether, our findings describe a novel pro-tumorigenic network that links PTEN loss to ADAM17 and NOTCH signalling, thus providing the rational for the use of γ-secretase inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer patients.""","""['Ajinkya Revandkar', 'Maria Luna Perciato', 'Alberto Toso', 'Abdullah Alajati', 'Jingjing Chen', 'Hermeto Gerber', 'Mitko Dimitrov', 'Andrea Rinaldi', 'Nicolas Delaleu', 'Emiliano Pasquini', ""Rocco D'Antuono"", 'Sandra Pinton', 'Marco Losa', 'Letizia Gnetti', 'Alberto Arribas', 'Patrick Fraering', 'Francesco Bertoni', 'Alain Nepveu', 'Andrea Alimonti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Targeting notch pathway enhances rapamycin antitumor activity in pancreas cancers through PTEN phosphorylation.', 'Vulnerabilities of PTEN-TP53-deficient prostate cancers to compound PARP-PI3K inhibition.', 'Notch promotes tumor metastasis in a prostate-specific Pten-null mouse model.', 'New insights into Notch1 regulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR1 signaling axis: targeted therapy of γ-secretase inhibitor resistant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'NOTCH and PTEN in prostate cancer.', 'γ-tocotrienol regulates gastric cancer by targeting notch signaling pathway.', 'ARPC5 is transcriptionally activated by KLF4, and promotes cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer via up-regulating ADAM17 : ARPC5 serves as an oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN Protein Phosphatase Activity Is Not Required for Tumour Suppression in the Mouse Prostate.', 'SOX8 Knockdown Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the Notch Signaling Pathway.']"""

Volume of the prostate is necessary to estimate the amount of BPH adenoma to determine the appropriate therapy or to select the surgical approach. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) is preferred for small glands and open prostatectomy for larger ones. Decrease in prostatic mass after hormonal manipulation or radiation therapy can be used as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy. The effect of prostate volume on biopsy outcome was assessed and was noted that there was an inverse relationship in between size of the gland and prostate cancer. A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in Department of Anatomy, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh to find out the difference in volume of the prostate gland of Bangladeshi people in relation to age. The present study was performed on 67 postmortem human prostate gland collected from the morgue in the Department of Forensic Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College by non random purposive sampling technique. The specimens were collected from Bangladeshi cadaver of age ranging from 10 to 80 years. All the specimens were grouped into three categories: Group A (upto 18 years), Group B (19 to 45 years) and Group C (above 45 years) according to age. Dissection was performed according to standard autopsy techniques. The volume of the prostate gland were measured and recorded. The mean volume of the prostate gland was 13.75ml in Group A, 24.44ml in Group B and 29.72ml in Group C. Variance analysis shows that mean differences of volume of the prostate were highly significant among all age groups. The volume of prostate gland was found to be increased with increasing age. For statistical analysis, differences between age groups were analyzed by using students unpaired 't' test.

Methods:   Totally 38 PCa patients underwent WB-MRI, bone scintigraphy and PSA detections, and 34 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients were checked with PSA. Pearson correlations were performed to determine associations among PSA, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and Gleason scoring.

The aim of this analysis was to compare posttreatment serum testosterone levels between patients undergoing subcapsular orchiectomy and patients treated with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin.  Materials and methods:   In this randomized clinical trial we included 58 consecutive hormone naïve men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer at Herlev and Gentofte University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark from September 2013 to March 2015. Followup was 48 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to subcapsular orchiectomy or triptorelin 22.5 mg given as 24-week depot injections. Androgen status was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry prior to treatment and after 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Between group differences in achieved hormone levels were analyzed by longitudinal Tobit regression.  Results:   Triptorelin injections resulted in 29% lower testosterone levels (95% CI 17.2-41.7) compared to subcapsular orchiectomy (p <0.001). A significantly higher proportion of men receiving triptorelin had testosterone levels less than 20 ng/dl at 12 and 48 weeks compared to men undergoing orchiectomy (97% vs 79% and 100% vs 87%, respectively, p <0.05). There was no detectable difference in the adrenal androgen reduction between the treatment groups.

The objective of our study was to explore the impact of age and body mass index (BMI) on postoperative incontinence, and the impact of such incontinence and urinary symptoms on QoL.  Material and methods:   Two hundred and seventy two patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy answered the questionnaires ICIQ-UI short-form (evaluating UI) and EORTC QoL PR25 (evaluating QoL) in the preoperative setting, then at 1, 3, 12 et 24 months after surgery. Data regarding bother due to UI and urinary symptoms were extrapolated and calculated from the EORT PR25 questionnaire. The modification of ICIQ, of the bother from UI and of urinary symptoms was compared between the preoperative and the early (1-3 months) and late postoperative period (12-24 months). Differences of these scores were explored across non-obese and obese patients, as well as across different age groups. Chi-squared and logistic regression models were performed to test the association between BMI, age and ICIQ score, the bother from UI and urinary symptom score.  Results:   Median age was 64 years and median BMI was 26.4kg/m2. After surgery, all scores (ICIQ, bother from UI and urinary symptoms) were significantly modified and worsened compared to preoperative values; in particular, median ICIQ passed from 1 to 10, 20% of patients were highly bothered by their urinary symptoms (compared to 2% in the preoperative setting) and the urinary score symptom passed from 8% to 33%. We observed a progressive amelioration of all scores of late controls (12-24 months), with a significantly improved QoL. Across BMI groups, we did not observe any significant difference in terms of modification of ICIQ, of the bother from UI or of urinary symptoms. Moreover, on multivariate logistic regression, BMI was not a risk factor for UI at neither 1 month (P>0.35) nor 12 months (P=0.35). On the other hand, age was significantly associated to an increased risk of UI in the immediate postoperative period on multivariate analysis (P<0.001). Indeed, the rate of patients with an ICIQ≥1 in the immediate postoperative period was higher in men>60 years old compared to younger men<60 years (96% vs 78%, P<0.001). When exploring the QoL scores, we did not observe any significant association between age and QoL, with the exception of an inversion correlation between age and urinary symptoms at 1 month after surgery (P=0.01).  Conclusion:   In this study, after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, older men appear to be at increased risk of immediate postoperative incontinence when compared to their younger counterparts, although their QoL is less likely to be bothered. BMI instead was not significantly associated to either urinary incontinence nor to QoL scores as bother form UI and urinary symptoms.

Objectives:   To determine the rate of clinically significant PCa detection in repeat targeted biopsy or surgery in patients with highly suspicious mpMRI findings and in an initial negative MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy.  Materials and methods:   In this single-center, retrospective study of prospectively generated data, men with highly suspicious lesions (Likert 5 score) on mpMRI and an initial negative MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy were reviewed. The rate of PCa detection in a subsequent MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy or radical prostatectomy was determined. Tumors in the intermediate- and high-risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria were considered clinically significant.  Results:   A total of 32 men with 38 Likert 5 lesions were identified. Repeat targeted biopsy or surgery detected cancer in 42% (16/38) of the Likert 5 lesions with initial negative targeted biopsy. Most of these cancers were intermediate- (69%; 11/16) or high-risk (25%; 4/16) tumors.

In human hepatocarcinoma and prostate cancer cells, the activation of ORs by odors modulates elementary physiological processes and leads to an inhibitory effect on proliferation. Cells of the respiratory tract are in direct contact with the surrounding air, in which a myriad of volatile molecules, especially odors, are present. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a high prevalence, a high mortality rate and is difficult to treat. NSCLC cells are nearly resistant to common chemotherapeutic approaches, and surgical resection provides the only possible chance of a cure for most patients. New approaches for the treatment of NSCLC are the focus of many current studies. Thus, it is of interest to characterize the functional expression of ORs in cancer cells of the lung and to investigate the impact of ORs on pathophysiological processes. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of OR2J3 and cytosolic Ca2+ increase via the activation of the agonist helional in the NSCLC cell line A549. We further investigated the underlying pathway. Helional triggers phoshoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), signaling the release of intracellular Ca2+ and phosphorylation of ERK. We observed that OR2J3 activation induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and migration in long-term stimulus experiments with helional.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 331320 prostate cancer patients who had primary and secondary Gleason patterns diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2012. We used the Fine and Gray proportional hazards model for subdistributions and the corresponding cumulative incidence to quantify the risk of PCSM. We found that the risk of PCSM approximately doubled with each GGG increase. Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy and using GGG1 (Gleason score ≤6) as the reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio for PCSM was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.54) for GGG2, 1.87 (95% CI 1.33-2.65) for GGG3, 5.03 (95% CI 3.59-7.06) for GGG4, and 10.92 (CI 8.03-14.84) for GGG5. Similar patterns were observed regardless of the type of primary cancer treatment received or clinical stage. In summary, our study, with large, racially diverse populations that reflect real world experiences, demonstrates that the new five-tiered GGG system predicts PCSM well regardless of treatment received or clinical stage at diagnosis.  Patient summary:   In this report we examined prostate cancer mortality using the new five-tiered cancer grading system using data for a large US population. We found that the new five-tiered cancer grading system can predict prostate cancer-specific mortality well, regardless of the type of primary cancer treatment and clinical stage.

However, the pathogenesis of CRC carcinogenesis is still unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-107 in the regulation of CRC cell proliferation and apoptosis. First, the expression of miR-107 was observed to be aberrantly increased in human CRC tumor tissues and cell lines when compared to the colonic control tissues and colon epithelial cells. Further study showed that the proliferative and apoptotic capacities of human CRC SW480 and LoVo cells were aberrantly regulated by miR-107. The proliferation of SW480 and LoVo cells was remarkably enhanced by the miR-107 mimic but suppressed by the miR-107 inhibitor when compared to the negative control. On the contrary, the apoptotic rate of both SW480 and LoVo cells was significantly inhibited by miR-107 overexpression but increased by miR-107 inhibition. In addition, we identified prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par4) as a direct target of miR-107 with a potential binding site on the 3'-UTR of mRNA, as evaluated by bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Par4 expression levels were significantly inhibited by the miR-107 mimic but upregulated by the miR-107 inhibitor in both SW480 and LoVo cells. Compared to the control, the increase in Par4 expression significantly inhibited the induction role of miR-107 in the proliferation of SW480 and LoVo cells, and the apoptotic rate of cells repressed by the miR-107 mimic was also reversed by Par4 overexpression. In summary, our results demonstrated that miR-107 exerts a positive role in the survival of CRC cells by directly targeting Par4.

Survey data were linked to individual-level PGT results through a secure data transfer process. Results Of the 1,042 customers who completed baseline and 6-month surveys (response rate, 71.2%), 762 had complete cancer-related data and were analyzed. Most customers reported that learning about their genetic risk of cancers was a motivation for testing (colorectal, 88%; prostate, 95%; breast, 94%). No customers tested positive for pathogenic mutations in highly penetrant cancer susceptibility genes. A minority of individuals received elevated single nucleotide polymorphism-based PGT cancer risk estimates (colorectal, 24%; prostate, 24%; breast, 12%). At 6 months, customers who received elevated PGT cancer risk estimates were not significantly more likely to change their diet, exercise, or advanced planning behaviors or engage in cancer screening, compared with individuals at average or reduced risk.

Methods:   In a pre-study, the planning CT scans of 23 patients with PCa receiving definitive EBRT were analyzed. The rectum was contoured according to 13 different definitions, and the dose distribution was correlated with the respective rectal volumes by generating DVH curves. Three definitions were identified to represent the most distinct differences in the shapes of the DVH curves: one anatomical definition recommended by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and two functional definitions based on the target volume. In the main study, the correlation between different relative DVH parameters derived from these three contouring definitions and the occurrence of rectal toxicity during and after EBRT was studied in two consecutive collectives. The first cohort consisted of 97 patients receiving primary curative EBRT and the second cohort consisted of 66 patients treated for biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy. Rectal toxicity was investigated by clinical investigation and scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Candidate parameters were the volume of the rectum, mean dose, maximal dose, volume receiving at least 60 Gy (V60), area under the DVH curve up to 25 Gy and area under the DVH curve up to 75 Gy in dependence of each chosen rectum definition. Multivariable logistic regression considered other clinical factors such as pelvine lymphatics vs local target volume, diabetes, prior rectal surgery, anticoagulation or haemorrhoids too.  Results:   In Cohort 1 (primary EBRT), the mean rectal volumes for definitions ""RTOG"", planning target volume ""(PTV)-based"" and ""PTV-linked"" were 100 cm3 [standard deviation (SD) 43 cm3], 60 cm3 (SD 26 cm3) and 74 cm3 (SD 31 cm3), respectively (p < 0.01; analysis of variance). The mean rectal doses according to these definitions were 35 Gy (SD 8 Gy), 48 Gy (SD 4 Gy) and 44 Gy (SD 5 Gy) (p < 0.01). In Cohort 2 (salvage EBRT), the mean rectal volumes were 114 cm3 (SD 47 cm3), 64 cm3 (SD 26 cm3) and 81 cm3 (SD 30 cm3) (p < 0.01) and the mean doses received by the rectum were 36 Gy (SD 8 Gy), 49 Gy (SD 5 Gy) and 44 Gy (SD 5 Gy) (p < 0.01). Acute or subacute rectal inflammation occurred in 69 (71.9%) patients in Cohort 1 and in 43 (70.5%) in Cohort 2. We did not find a correlation between all investigated DVH parameters and rectal toxicity, irrespective of the investigated definition. By adding additional variables in multivariate analysis, the predictive ability was substantially improved. Still, there was essentially no difference in the probability of predicting rectal inflammation occurrence between the tested contouring definitions.  Conclusion:   The RTOG anatomy-based recommendations are questionable in comparison with functional definitions, as they result in higher variances in several relative DVH parameters. Moreover, the anatomy-based definition is no better and no worse in the predictive value concerning clinical end points. Advances in knowledge: Functional definitions for the rectum as OAR are easier to apply, faster to contour, have smaller variances and do not offer less information than the anatomy-based RTOG definition.""","""['Mirko Nitsche', 'Werner Brannath', 'Matthias Brückner', 'Dirk Wagner', 'Alexander Kaltenborn', 'Nils Temme', 'Robert M Hermann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Influence of organ at risk definition on rectal dose-volume histograms in patients with prostate cancer undergoing external-beam radiotherapy.', 'Significant correlation between rectal DVH and late bleeding in patients treated after radical prostatectomy with conformal or conventional radiotherapy (66.6-70.2 Gy).', 'Emptying the rectum before treatment delivery limits the variations of rectal dose - volume parameters during 3DCRT of prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of late rectal toxicity from conventional versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors.', 'Autosegmentation based on different-sized training datasets of consistently-curated volumes and impact on rectal contours in prostate cancer radiation therapy.']"""

Here, we identified 4 core autophagy genes: ATG4B, ATG4D, ULK1, and ULK2, in addition to the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, as transcriptional targets of AR in prostate cancer. These findings were significant in light of our recent observation that androgens promoted prostate cancer cell growth in part through the induction of autophagy. Expression of these 5 genes was essential for maximal androgen-mediated autophagy and cell proliferation. In addition, expression of each of these 5 genes alone or in combination was sufficient to increase prostate cancer cell growth independent of AR activity. Further, bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the expression of these genes correlated with disease progression in 3 separate clinical cohorts.

Materials and methods:   Expression of lincRNA-p21 was assessed by real-time PCR in cell lines and in human tissues. Lentivirus carrying sh-lincRNA-p21, lincRNA-p21 or control constructs were used to determine their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. A mouse xenograft model was employed to explore the functions of lincRNA-p21 on cancer cell population growth in vivo. Relationships between p53 downstream genes and lincRNA-p21 levels were explored by real-time PCR, western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation.  Results:   LincRNA-p21 was found to be down-regulated in human prostate cancer, and low levels of lincRNA-p21 correlated with high disease stage and prediction of poor survival. We further showed that lincRNA-p21 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and reduced rate of prostate cancer cell population growth in vivo. Study of mechanisms involved revealed that lincRNA-p21 promoted apoptosis and induced expression of p53 downstream genes by regulating p53 binding to their promoters. Finally, we showed that expression of p53 downstream genes was reduced in the malignant prostate tissues, which correlated with lincRNA-p21 level.

Human AR transcriptional activity involves interactions with coregulatory proteins that include primate-specific melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11), a coactivator that increases AR transcriptional activity during prostate cancer progression to castration-resistant/recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to identify androgen-regulated MAGE-A11-dependent genes in LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells after lentivirus shRNA knockdown of MAGE-A11. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to assess androgen-dependent AR recruitment, and immunocytochemistry to localize an androgen-dependent protein in prostate cancer cells and tissue and in the CWR22 human prostate cancer xenograft.  Results:   Microarray analysis of androgen-treated LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells indicated follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is up-regulated by MAGE-A11. Androgen-dependent up-regulation of FSTL1 was inhibited in LAPC-4 cells by lentivirus shRNA knockdown of AR or MAGE-A11. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated AR recruitment to intron 10 of the FSTL1 gene that contains a classical consensus androgen response element. Increased levels of FSTL1 protein in LAPC-4 cells correlated with higher levels of MAGE-A11 relative to other prostate cancer cells. FSTL1 mRNA levels increased in CRPC and castration-recurrent CWR22 xenografts in association with predominantly nuclear FSTL1. Increased nuclear localization of FSTL1 in prostate cancer was suggested by predominantly cytoplasmic FSTL1 in benign prostate epithelial cells and predominantly nuclear FSTL1 in epithelial cells in CRPC tissue and the castration-recurrent CWR22 xenograft. AR expression studies showed nuclear colocalization of AR and endogenous FSTL1 in response to androgen.  Conclusion:   AR and MAGE-A11 cooperate in the up-regulation of FSTL1 to promote growth and progression of CRPC.

Methods:   Seventy-three biopsies were performed in 65 patients over a 13-year period (2002-2015). Mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at biopsy was 7.8 ng/mL (range 0.37-31.5). Electronic medical records were reviewed for procedural details and complications. Mean PSA and number of cores in malignant and benign cohorts were compared with Student's t test.  Results:   Technical success rate was 97.3% (71/73; mean cores 8, range 3-28). Of these, 43.6% (31/71) yielded malignancy (mean Gleason score 7, range 6-10) and 56.3% (40/71) yielded benign tissue.

Recently, ZFP91 zinc finger protein has been found to be upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines. It is a potentially important oncogenic protein; however only limited data regarding its biological function and expression patterns are available. To date, ZFP91 has been shown to be a key factor in activation of noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway as well as to be involved in HIF-1α signaling in cancer cells. The present study aimed to characterize ZFP91 expression in prostate cancer specimens. Furthermore, since our earlier reports showed discrepancies between ZFP91 mRNA and protein levels, we studied this interrelationship in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines using siRNA mediated knockdown.

Previously, we found the Mediator complex subunit MED15 to be overexpressed in CRPC and to correlate with clinical outcome. Therefore, we investigated whether MED15 is implicated in the signaling changes taking place during progression to CRPC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MED15 on matched samples from the same patients before and after ADT reveals significantly increased MED15 expression after ADT in 72%. A validation cohort comprising samples before and after therapy confirmed our observations. Protein analysis for pAKT and pSMAD3 shows that MED15 correlates with PI3K and TGFß activities, respectively, and that hyper-activation of both pathways simultaneously correlates with highest levels of MED15. We further show that MED15 protein expression increases in LNCaP cells under androgen deprivation, and via EGF mediated PI3K activation. PI3K/mTOR and TGFß-receptor inhibition results in decreased MED15 expression. MED15 knockdown reduces LNCaP cell viability and induces apoptosis during androgen deprivation, while cell cycle is not affected. Collectively, MED15 overexpression arises during ADT via hyper-activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, thus MED15 may serve as a predictive marker for response to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relative insensitivity of VMAT plan quality to gantry angle spacing (GS). Most previous VMAT planning and dosimetric work for GS resolution has been conducted for single arc VMAT. In this work, a quantitative comparison of dose-volume indices (DIs) was made for partial-, single- and double-arc VMAT plans optimized at 2°, 3° and 4° GS, representing a large variation in deliverable multileaf collimator segments. VMAT plans of six prostate cancer and six head-and-neck cancer patients were simulated for an Elekta SynergyS® Linac (Elekta Ltd, Crawley, UK), using the SmartArc™ module of Pinnacle³ TPS, (version 9.2, Philips Healthcare). All optimization techniques generated clinically acceptable VMAT plans, except for the single-arc for the head-and-neck cancer patients. Plan quality was assessed by comparing the DIs for the planning target volume, organs at risk and normal tissue. A GS of 2°, with finest resolution and consequently highest intensity modulation, was considered to be the reference, and this was compared with GS 3° and 4°. The differences between the majority of reference DIs and compared DIs were <2%. The metrics, such as treatment plan optimization time and pretreatment (phantom) dosimetric calculation time, supported the use of a GS of 4°. The ArcCHECK™ phantom-measured dosimetric agreement verifications resulted in a >95.0% passing rate, using the criteria for γ (3%, 3 mm). In conclusion, a GS of 4° is an optimal choice for minimal usage of planning resources without compromise of plan quality.""","""['Ghulam Murtaza', 'Stefania Cora', 'Ehsan Ullah Khan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Dosimetric effect of limited aperture multileaf collimator on VMAT plan quality: A study of prostate and head-and-neck cancers.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Impact of beam configuration on VMAT plan quality for Pinnacle3Auto-Planning for head and neck cases.', 'Optimal VMAT Delivery for Elekta MLC Beam Modulator: A Study of Collimator Rotation for Head and Neck Planning.', 'Influence of segment width on plan quality for volumetric modulated arc based stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric sensitivity of leaf width on volumetric modulated arc therapy plan quality: an objective approach.', 'Monte Carlo Modeling of the Agility MLC for IMRT and VMAT Calculations.', 'Evaluation of complexity and deliverability of prostate cancer treatment plans designed with a knowledge-based VMAT planning technique.', 'Dosimetric effect of limited aperture multileaf collimator on VMAT plan quality: A study of prostate and head-and-neck cancers.']"""

Using a genome wide shRNA screen, we identified GABARAPL1 as a potential CaP metastasis suppressor. GABARAPL1 mRNA levels inversely correlate with the invasive potential of a panel of human CaP cell lines. Lower mRNA levels correlate with higher Gleason scores in clinical CaP tumor samples. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves analysis showed that GABARAPL1 down-regulation in cancer tissues is associated with decreased disease-free survival in CaP patients. Knockdown of GABARAPL1 in human LNCaP cells results in increased invasion in vitro and lymph node metastasis in vivo. Vice versa, ectopic expression of GABARAPL1 decreases the invasiveness of CWR22Rv1 cells. Our previous in vitro shRNA screening identified FOXO4, a PI3K/Akt-inactivating downstream target, as a potential CaP metastasis suppressor. We show here that silencing FOXOs leads to reduced GABARAPL1 expression and enhanced invasion in LNCaP cells. Transfection of constitutively-activated Akt (myr-Akt) increased the invasion of LNCaP cells, which is associated with the inactivation of FOXOs and decreased GABARAPL1 expression. Indeed, forced expression of GABARAPL1 reversed the increased invasiveness of LNCaP/myr-Akt cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry analysis shows that Akt phosphorylation is negatively correlated with GABARAPL1 expression in human CaP tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that the suppression of FOXOs-GABARAPL1 signaling by Akt is an important mechanism for CaP progression and metastasis.""","""['Wei Su', 'Shibao Li', 'Xiaofan Chen', 'Lingyu Yin', 'Ping Ma', 'Yingyu Ma', 'Bing Su']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies FOXO4 as a metastasis-suppressor through counteracting PI3K/AKT signal pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway promotes prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Re-evaluating the role of FOXOs in cancer.', 'Chemokines and chemokine receptors as promoters of prostate cancer growth and progression.', 'A new perspective on the autophagic and non-autophagic functions of the GABARAP protein family: a potential therapeutic target for human diseases.', 'Bioinformatics Identification of Regulatory Genes and Mechanism Related to Hypoxia-Induced PD-L1 Inhibitor Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'A New Potential Therapeutic Target for Cancer in Ubiquitin-Like Proteins-UBL3.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Loss of GABARAPL1 confers ferroptosis resistance to cancer stem-like cells in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Patients diagnosed with clinically localized disease identified as intermediate or high-risk are often treated by radical prostatectomy. Approximately 33% of these patients will suffer recurrence after surgery. Identifying patients likely to experience recurrence after radical prostatectomy would lead to improved clinical outcomes, as these patients could receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Here, we report a new tool for prediction of prostate cancer recurrence based on the expression pattern of a small set of cooperation response genes (CRGs). CRGs are a group of genes downstream of cooperating oncogenic mutations previously identified in a colon cancer model that are critical to the cancer phenotype. We show that systemic dysregulation of CRGs is also found in prostate cancer, including a 4-gene signature (HBEGF, HOXC13, IGFBP2, and SATB1) capable of differentiating recurrent from non-recurrent prostate cancer. To develop a suitable diagnostic tool to predict disease outcomes in individual patients, multiple algorithms and data handling strategies were evaluated on a training set using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The best-performing algorithm, when used in combination with a predictive nomogram based on clinical staging, predicted recurrent and non-recurrent disease outcomes in a blinded validation set with 83% accuracy, outperforming previous methods. Disease-free survival times between the cohort of prostate cancers predicted to recur and predicted not to recur differed significantly (p = 1.38x10-6). Therefore, this test allows us to accurately identify prostate cancer patients likely to experience future recurrent disease immediately following removal of the primary tumor.""","""['Justin Komisarof', 'Matthew McCall', 'Laurel Newman', 'Wiam Bshara', 'James L Mohler', 'Carl Morrison', 'Hartmut Land']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Integration of gene expression profiling and clinical variables to predict prostate carcinoma recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'New approaches to adjuvant therapy for patients with adverse histopathologic findings following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence by using discretization supports the critical contribution of the extra-cellular matrix genes.', 'A transcriptomic signature for prostate cancer relapse prediction identified from the differentially expressed genes between TP53 mutant and wild-type tumors.', 'Lemur Tyrosine Kinases and Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Prostate cancer racial, socioeconomic, geographic disparities: targeting the genomic landscape and splicing events in search for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets.', 'HOXC-AS2 mediates the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of non-small cell lung cancer by combining with HOXC13 gene.']"""

Methods:   A population-based cohort of approximately 2 million respondents to the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census was followed for cancer diagnoses and deaths using probabilistic linkage to cancer and death registries until 2009. Excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) and 5-year age-standardized relative survival rates were calculated for 15 cancers using age, sex, ethnicity, and calendar-time-specific life tables derived from the cohort at large.  Results:   First Nations diagnosed with cancers of the colon and rectum, lung and bronchus, breast, prostate, oral cavity and pharynx, cervix, ovary, or with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia all had significantly poorer 5-year survival than their non-Aboriginal peers. For colorectal cancer, a significant disparity was only present between 2001 and 2009 (EMRR: 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28-1.80). For prostate cancer, a significant disparity was only present between 1992 and 2000 (EMRR: 2.76; 95% CI, 1.81-4.21). Adjusting for income and rurality had little impact on the EMRRs.  Conclusions:   Compared with non-Aboriginals, First Nations people had poorer survival for 14 of 15 of the most common cancers, and disparities could not be explained by income and rurality.

This study examined the extent of changes in recorded socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival and distant stage when the measure of socioeconomic disadvantage was based on smaller Census Collection Districts (CDs) instead of Statistical Local Areas (SLAs).  Methods:   Population-based New South Wales Cancer Registry data were used to identify cases diagnosed with primary invasive cancer in 2000-2008 (n=264,236). Logistic regression and competing risk regression modelling were performed to examine socioeconomic differences in odds of distant stage and hazard of cancer death for all sites combined and separately for breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers.  Results:   For all sites collectively, associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and cancer survival and distant stage were stronger when the CD-based socioeconomic disadvantage measure was used compared with the SLA-based measure. The CD-based measure showed a more consistent socioeconomic gradient with a linear upward trend of risk of cancer death/distant stage with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage. Site-specific analyses provided similar findings for the risk of death but less consistent results for the likelihood of distant stage.  Conclusions:   The use of socioeconomic disadvantage measure based on the smallest available spatial unit should be encouraged in the future.

However, only low fractions of total cell-free DNA originates from cancer cells, limiting the applicability of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Optimal sample processing is consequently of uttermost importance. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro stability of ctDNA.  Experimental design:   Blood was collected in 10 ml EDTA or Streck tubes. Three conditions (EDTA and Streck tubes in room temperature, EDTA tubes at five degrees) and four time points (plasma harvested from blood aliquots of each 10 ml tube in a time series up to 24 h) were investigated. Each condition was evaluated in five metastatic prostate cancer patients. Subsequently, three additional patients were collected enabling investigation of the in vitro stability in EDTA tubes up to 48 h.  Methods:   The in vitro stability of ctDNA was interrogated by low-pass whole genome sequencing which allows for the identification of somatic copy-number alterations (CNAs). In silico simulations demonstrated that non-parametric testing could detect a 1% contamination by white blood cell DNA. Mutational profiling was performed by targeted, in-solution based hybridization capture and subsequent sequencing. The allelic fraction of individual mutations was used as an estimate of the in vitro stability.  Results:   Somatic CNAs were detected in all patients. Surprisingly, the ctDNA levels at zero hours were not significantly different to 24 or 48 hour in vitro incubation in any investigated condition. Subsequently, mutational profiling corroborated the conclusions from the CNA analysis.  Conclusions:   The stability of ctDNA simplifies logistics without the requirement of immediate processing or applying fixatives to prevent white blood cell lysis.""","""['Emanuela Henao Diaz', 'Jeffrey Yachnin', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Johan Lindberg']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Comparative analysis of circulating tumor DNA stability In K3EDTA, Streck, and CellSave blood collection tubes.', 'Performance of Streck cfDNA Blood Collection Tubes for Liquid Biopsy Testing.', 'Optimised Pre-Analytical Methods Improve KRAS Mutation Detection in Circulating Tumour DNA (ctDNA) from Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).', 'Recent advances in circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA in metastatic prostate cancer: a review.', 'Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a liquid biopsy for melanoma.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA Characteristics Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Its Correlation With Clinical Parameters in Patients With Lymphoma.', 'Low-Level Mouse DNA in Conditioned Medium Generates False Positive Cross-Species Contamination Results in Human Organoid Cultures.', 'Harmonizing Cell-Free DNA Collection and Processing Practices through Evidence-Based Guidance.', 'Evaluation of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations detection in plasma using an automated system for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Cost and efficacy comparison of prenatal recall and reflex DNA screening for trisomy 21, 18 and 13.']"""

Based on its marked altered expression and its roles in modulating cell division, cytokineses and migration, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms regulating hNUDC expression in cancer cells is critical. In this study, we identified miR-194 as a downstream target of hNUDC and linked its expression to reduced metastatic capacity and tumorigenicity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Using miRNA target prediction programs, hNUDC mRNA was found to contain a potential binding site for miR-194 within its 3'UTR. A Reporter assay confirmed that post-transcriptional regulation of hNUDC was dependent on the miR-194 binding site. Forced expression of miR-194 in PCa cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, led to a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of hNUDC. Overexpression of miR-194 in these cells inhibited cell migration and invasion, and induced multinucleated cells. Our data showed that hNUDC knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced the migration and invasion in the PC-3 and DU-145 cells, phenocopying the results of miR-194 overexpression. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated stable expression of miR-194 in PCa cells reduced the ability of colony formation as detected by a soft agar assay and exhibited significantly less tumorigenic ability in vivo. Our results suggest a novel role for miR-194 in effectively controlling cell metastatic processes in PCa cells via the regulation of hNUDC expression.""","""['Qi Kong', 'Xu-Shen Chen', 'Tian Tian', 'Xiang-You Xia', 'Peilin Xu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['miR-195 Inhibits EMT by Targeting FGF2 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MicroRNA-25 promotes gastric cancer proliferation, invasion, and migration by directly targeting F-box and WD-40 Domain Protein 7, FBXW7.', 'miR-134 suppresses the migration and invasion of non‑small cell lung cancer by targeting ITGB1.', 'The nuclear migration gene NudC and human hematopoiesis.', 'Missing link between microRNA and prostate cancer.', 'Loss of microRNA-135b Enhances Bone Metastasis in Prostate Cancer and Predicts Aggressiveness in Human Prostate Samples.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'microRNA-194 is increased in polycystic ovary syndrome granulosa cell and induce KGN cells apoptosis by direct targeting heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA ZNRD1-AS1 inhibits progression of bladder cancer by regulating miR-194 and ZEB1.', 'Urinary Exosomal MicroRNAs as Potential Non-invasive Biomarkers in Breast Cancer Detection.']"""

Thus limiting the availability of phosphate is likely to interfere with the metabolism of rapidly growing malignant cells. The human hormone glucagon and the anti metabolite mithramycin reduce serum phosphate by increasing phosphaturia and are both very effective in treating Paget's disease of bone, a precancerous condition. In this disorder large doses of glucagon given intravenously relieve bone pain and cause serum phosphate and alkaline phosphatase as well as urine hydroxyproline to fall, indicating a marked reduction in bone turnover. A constant iv infusion of glucagon was given to each of three patients all of whom had secondary malignant bone deposits. Two of the patients had primary prostate cancer and one had a squamous cell lung tumour. All three patients had relief of bone pain and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase. Serum acid phosphatase also fell in the two patients with prostate cancer. It is proposed that the marked drop in serum phosphate due to glucagon causes intracellular phosphate to fall. This in turn disrupts the addition and removal of phosphate groups essential for the proper functioning of cyclin and cyclin dependent kinase. These two proteins control the transition from G1 to S (DNA synthesis phase) and G2 to M (mitotic phase) in the dividing cycle of malignant cells. Depriving a tumour of an essential ingredient used in phosphorylation reactions will disrupt its growth. It is also proposed that, by the same mechanism, glucagon induced hypophosphataemia renders malignant cells more sensitive to established chemotherapeutic agents and radiation waves. If this hypothesis proves to be correct, lowering intracellular phosphate may become an useful tool in cancer therapy. However extensive studies are necessary to determine whether mitosis in cancer cells can be advantageously disrupted by glucagon induced hypophosphataemia.""","""['John Rhys Condon']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""[""Glucagon in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone."", ""Mithramycin therapy in Paget's disease."", ""Tubular excretion of phosphate in Paget's disease of bone.

We explored whether stratification by number of positive nodes enhances our institutional prediction model for biochemical recurrence after RP.  Methods:   A total of 7789 patients underwent RP and pelvic lymph node dissection from 1995 to 2012 at a tertiary referral center. We compared two recurrence prediction models: one incorporated lymph node invasion and the other tracked the number of positive nodes. Existing and updated models' discrimination was assessed using Harrell's c-index and calibration. The 10-fold cross-validation was performed to correct for model overfitting.  Results:   Of the 491 patients (6.3%) harboring nodal disease, 387 (5.0%) had 1-2 positive nodes and 104 (1.3%) had ⩾3 positive nodes. Data on number of positive nodes did not improve the c-index for the cohort as a whole. When we assessed discrimination for node-positive patients only, c-index for the model with number of positive nodes was 0.01 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.024) higher than the model with lymph node invasion. Illustrative examples were provided by reclassification tables using number of positive lymph nodes.

Methods:   Seventy-six consecutive patients with PCa who underwent DWI and surgery were included. Based on pathologic tumour location, two readers independently performed DWI scoring according to the revised Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADSv2). ADC ratios of benign to cancerous prostatic tissue were then measured independently and compared between cases showing concordant and discordant DWI scores ≥4. Area under the curve (AUC) and threshold of ADC ratio were analyzed for DWI scores ≥4.  Results:   The rate of inter-reader disagreement for DWI score ≥4 was 11.8% (9/76). ADC ratios were higher in concordant vs. discordant DWI scores ≥4 (median, 1.7 vs. 1.1-1.2; p < 0.001). For DWI scores ≥4, the AUCs of ADC ratios were 0.970 for reader 1 and 0.959 for reader 2. In patients with an ADC ratio >1.3, the rate of inter-reader disagreement for DWI score ≥4 decreased to 5.9-6.0%.

To elucidate the role of STS in cancer cell proliferation, we investigated whether STS is able to regulate the integrin signaling pathway. We found that overexpression of STS in HeLa cells increases the protein and mRNA levels of integrin β1 and fibronectin, a ligand of integrin α5β1. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), one of the main metabolites of STS, also increases mRNA and protein expression of integrin β1 and fibronectin. Further, STS expression and DHEA treatment enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at the Tyr 925 residue. Moreover, increased phosphorylation of ERK at Thr 202 and Tyr 204 residues by STS indicates that STS activates the MAPK/ ERK pathway.

We hypothesized that nuclear Cat L may promote EMT via CUX1 and that this could be antagonized with the Cat L-specific inhibitor Z-FY-CHO. Mesenchymal prostate (ARCaP-M and ARCaP-E overexpressing Snail) and breast (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 overexpressing Snail) cancer cells expressed lower E-cadherin activity, higher Snail, vimentin, and Cat L activity, and a p110/p90 active CUX1 form, compared to epithelial prostate (ARCaP-E and ARCaP-Neo) and breast (MCF-7 and MCF-7 Neo) cancer cells. There was increased binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter in mesenchymal cells compared to epithelial prostate and breast cells. Treatment of mesenchymal cells with the Cat L inhibitor Z-FY-CHO led to nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of Cat L, decreased binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter, reversed EMT, and decreased cell migration/invasion. Overall, our novel data suggest that a positive feedback loop between Snail-nuclear Cat L-CUX1 drives EMT, which can be antagonized by Z-FY-CHO.

Allosteric inhibitors regulate aberrant kinase activity by stabilizing the protein in inactive conformation. Several natural compounds have been reported as inhibitors for kinases. In this study, to identify potential natural allosteric inhibitor for Akt1, we generated a seven-point pharmacophore model and screened it through natural compound library. Quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside or Q7G was found to be the best among selected molecules based on its hydrogen bond occupancy with key allosteric residues, persistent polar contacts and salt bridges that stabilize Akt1 in inactive conformation and minimum binding free energy during molecular dynamics simulation. Q7G induced dose-dependent inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA MB-231) and arrested them in G1 and sub-G phase. This was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Expression of p-Akt (Ser473) was also down-regulated which might be due to Akt1 inhibition in inactive conformation.

Results:   In total, 113/213 male patients (53.1%) had PCa in the RC specimen. Patients׳ age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and also free PSA% were significant predictors for PCa. In addition, adverse bladder histology (≥pT3) was found in 63.7% of patients with PCa. A total of 52.2% (59/113) of patients had at least a Gleason score (GS) 7 in final pathology and 10.6% of RC specimens showed an organ border growth (≥pT3a). It was noted that 28.3% of patients experienced a biochemical recurrence (PSA≥0.2ng/ml), among them 86.7% had GS≥7 in the RC specimen; however, 2 patients were diagnosed with a GS 5. Moreover, we found that 80% of patients with biochemical recurrence had an organ-extended (≥pT3) histology of the bladder and 40% of patients with biochemical recurrence died of PCa rather than from BC.  Conclusion:   Concomitant PCa is occurring in>50% of RC specimens with a significant proportion having characteristics (GS, pathological stage) of clinically relevant disease. Adverse bladder histology is a risk factor for both PCa and biochemical PSA recurrence.

Results:   Based on the distinct 3D telomere signatures of CTC before treatment, patients were divided into 3 groups. ADT and RT resulted in distinct changes in 3D telomere signatures of CTCs, which were unique for each of the 3 patient groups.

This is a prospective development study assessing the feasibility of Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound (MRI-TRUS) fusion focal cryotherapy.  Methods and materials:   Consecutive patients undergoing focal cryotherapy were included in an academic registry (December 2013-June 2014). MRI-TRUS fusion focal cryotherapy was offered to men with visible clinically significant prostate cancer (Galil SeedNet system). Eligibility was determined by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), and transperineal template mapping or targeted biopsies. A rigid fusion platform (Biojet) was used with the operator ensuring the ice ball covered at least the lesion. Adverse events were scored using the NCICTC V4. Genitourinary toxicity was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures (IPSS, IIEF-15, and UCLA-EPIC). Early contrast-enhanced MRI and mpMRI at 6 to 12 months were used to assess extent of lesion ablation.  Results:   Of 23 patients scheduled, 5 did not have image fusion owing to surgeon preference. Overall, 18 patients undergoing image-fusion cryotherapy had median age of 68 (interquartile range [IQR]: 65-73) years and median preoperative prostate-specific antigen = 9.54 (5.65-16)ng/ml. In all, 13 (72.2%) and 5 (27.8%) patients had intermediate and high-risk cancer, respectively. In total, 10 adverse events were reported with one of these as serious (grade 3) because of admission for hematuria requiring wash out only. There was no difference in the IIEF-15 between baseline and study end (P = 0.24). The IPSS remained stable (P = 0.12), whereas the UCLA-EPIC tended to improve (P = 0.065). The prostate-specific antigen level significantly decreased at 1.8 (1.04-2.93) ng/ml (P<0.001). Both early and late mpMRI showed no residual disease in the treated area.

We compared daily variation detected by two non-ionizing imaging modalities (surface imaging and trans-abdominal ultrasound, US) to verify prostate patient setup and internal organ variations.  Methods:   Forty patients with organ confined prostate cancer and candidates to curative radiotherapy were enrolled in this prospective study. At each treatment session, after laser alignment, all patients received imaging by a 3D-surface and a 3D-US system. The shifts along the three directions (anterior-posterior AP, cranial-caudal CC, and later-lateral LL) were measured in terms of systematic and random errors. Then, we performed statistical analysis on the differences and the possible correlations between the two modalities.  Results:   For both IGRT modalities, surface imaging and US, 1318 acquisitions were collected. According with Shapiro Wilk test, the positioning error distributions were not Gaussian for both modalities. The differences between the systematic errors detected by the two modalities were statistically significant only in LL direction (p < 0.05), while the differences between the random errors were not statistically significant in any directions. The 95% confidence interval of the residual errors obtained by subtracting the random errors detected with surface images to those detected with US was included in the range from -7 mm to 7 mm corresponding to the minimum PTV margin adopted in AP direction in our clinical routine.  Conclusions:   From our data, it emerges that setup misalignments measured by surface imaging can be predictive of US displacements after the adjustment for systematic errors. Moreover, surface imaging can detect setup errors predictive of registration errors measured by US. This data suggest that the two IGRT modalities could be considered as complementary to each other and could represent a daily ""low-cost"" and non-invasive IGRT modality in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Marco Krengli', 'Gianfranco Loi', 'Carla Pisani', 'Debora Beldì', 'Giuseppina Apicella', 'Valentina Amisano', 'Marco Brambilla']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer using 3 different techniques: localization data of 186 patients.', 'Patient positioning using in-room kV CT for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'ESTRO ACROP consensus guideline on the use of image guided radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'The Potential of Photoacoustic Imaging in Radiation Oncology.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Shorter treatment times reduce the impact of intra-fractional motion : A\xa0real-time 4DUS study comparing VMAT vs. step-and-shoot IMRT for prostate cancer.']"""

Our recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 co-operated with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis, but antagonized Kras to inhibit skin tumorigenesis, suggesting a tissue/context dependent function of Sag. However, it is totally unknown whether and how Sag would play in prostate tumorigenesis, triggered by Pten loss.  Methods:   Sag and Pten double conditional knockout mice were generated and prostate specific deletion of Sag and Pten was achieved by PB4-Cre, and their effect on prostate tumorigenesis was evaluated by H&E staining. The methods of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Western blotting were utilized to examine expression of various proteins in prostate cancer tissues or cell lines. The effect of SAG knockdown in proliferation, survival and migration was evaluated in two prostate cancer cell lines. The poly-ubiquitylation of PHLPP1 and DEPTOR was evaluated by both in vivo and in vitro ubiquitylation assays.  Results:   SAG is overexpressed progressively from early-to-late stage of human prostate cancer with the highest expression seen in metastatic lesion. Sag deletion inhibits prostate tumorigenesis triggered by Pten loss in a mouse model as a result of suppressed proliferation. SAG knockdown in human prostate cancer cells inhibits a) proliferation in monolayer and soft agar, b) clonogenic survival, and c) migration. SAG is an E3 ligase that promotes ubiquitylation and degradation of PHLPP1 and DEPTOR, leading to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, whereas SAG knockdown caused their accumulation. Importantly, growth suppression triggered by SAG knockdown was partially rescued by simultaneous knockdown of PHLPP1 or DEPTOR, suggesting their causal role. Accumulation of Phlpp1 and Deptor with corresponding inactivation of Akt/mTOR was also detected in Sag-null prostate cancer tissues.  Conclusions:   Sag is an oncogenic cooperator of Pten-loss for prostate tumorigenesis. Targeting SAG E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for the treatment of prostate cancer associated with Pten loss.""","""['Mingjia Tan', 'Jie Xu', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Felix Feng', 'Yi Sun']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Inactivation of Sag/Rbx2/Roc2 e3 ubiquitin ligase triggers senescence and inhibits kras-induced immortalization.', 'Transgenic expression of Sag/Rbx2 E3 causes early stage tumor promotion, late stage cytogenesis and acinar loss in the Kras-PDAC model.', 'Inactivation of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses KrasG12D-driven lung tumorigenesis.', 'Functional characterization of SAG/RBX2/ROC2/RNF7, an antioxidant protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase.', 'Targeting the mTOR-DEPTOR pathway by CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases: therapeutic application.', 'LINC01088/miR-22/CDC6 Axis Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression by Activating the PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'RNF7 Induces Skeletal Muscle Cell Apoptosis and Arrests Cell Autophagy via Upregulation of THBS1 and Inactivation of the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in a Rat Sepsis Model.', 'RNF7 Facilitated the Tumorigenesis of Pancreatic Cancer by Activating PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.', 'The UBE2C/CDH1/DEPTOR axis is an oncogene and tumor suppressor cascade in lung cancer cells.', 'The roles of KLHL family members in human cancers.']"""

The expression of TIG1 is decreased in malignant prostate carcinoma or poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, but TIG1 is present in benign or well-differentiated tumors. Ectopic TIG1 expression led to suppression of growth in cancer cells. However, the function of TIG1 in cell differentiation is still unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we found that transmembrane protein 192 (TMEM192) interacted with TIG1. We also found that both TIG1A and TIG1B isoforms interacted and co-localized with TMEM192 in HtTA cervical cancer cells. The expression of TIG1 induced the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including Beclin-1 and LC-3B. The silencing of TMEM192 reduced the TIG1-mediated upregulation of autophagic activity. Furthermore, silencing of either TIG1 or TMEM192 led to alleviation of the upregulation of autophagy induced by all-trans retinoic acid.

This leads to significant radioactivity in the bladder, which may limit the PET-detection of local recurrence (LR) of prostate cancer (PC) after radical prostatectomy (RP), developing in close proximity to the bladder. Here, we analyze if there is additional value of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) compared to the 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET-component of PET/CT or PET/MRI to detect LR.  Methods:   One hundred and nineteen patients with biochemical recurrence after prior RP underwent both hybrid 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CTlow-dose (1 h p.i.) and -PET/MRI (2-3 h p.i.) including a mpMRI protocol of the prostatic bed. The comparison of both methods was restricted to the abdomen with focus on LR (McNemar). Bladder-LR distance and recurrence size were measured in axial T2w-TSE. A logistic regression was performed to determine the influence of these variables on detectability in 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET. Standardized-uptake-value (SUVmean) quantification of LR was performed.  Results:   There were 93/119 patients that had at least one pathologic finding. In addition, 18/119 Patients (15.1%) were diagnosed with a LR in mpMRI of PET/MRI but only nine were PET-positive in PET/CT and PET/MRI. This mismatch was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Detection of LR using the PET-component was significantly influenced by proximity to the bladder (p = 0.028). The PET-pattern of LR-uptake was classified into three types (1): separated from bladder; (2): fuses with bladder, and (3): obliterated by bladder). The size of LRs did not affect PET-detectability (p = 0.84), mean size was 1.7 ± 0.69 cm long axis, 1.2 ± 0.46 cm short-axis.

Participants/setting:   In 2013-2014, 40 prostate cancer patients in the southeastern United States were randomized and allocated equally to weight-loss and wait-list control arms while they awaited prostatectomy; stool samples were collected on a subset of 22 patients.  Intervention:   Registered dietitian nutritionists and exercise physiologists provided semi-weekly in-person and telephone-based guidance on calorie-restricted diets and exercise to promote an approximate weight loss of 0.91 kg/wk.  Main outcome measures:   Baseline and follow-up 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted and analyzed (using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary recall system; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) for macronutrients, micronutrients, and food groups. Microbiome analysis targeting the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was performed on fecal samples. Biopsy Gleason sum data were accessed from diagnostic pathology reports.  Statistical analyses performed:   Associations between dietary factors and operational taxonomic units were determined by β-diversity analysis. Wilcoxon signed rank, and Mann-Whitney U testing assessed within- and between-arm differences. Associations between Gleason sum and operational taxonomic units, and diet and operational taxonomic units, were analyzed using Spearman correlations.  Results:   At baseline, Proteobacteria (median 0.06, interquartile range 0.01 to 0.16) were abundant, with four orders positively associated with Gleason sum.

The conventional approach to investigating prostatic diseases is based on two-dimensional (2D) cell culturing. This method, however, does not provide a three-dimensional (3D) environment, therefore impeding a satisfying simulation of the prostate gland in which the PCa cells proliferate. Cryogel scaffolds represent a valid alternative to 2D culturing systems for studying the normal and pathological behavior of the prostate cells thanks to their 3D pore architecture that reflects more closely the physiological environment in which PCa cells develop. In this work the 3D morphology of three potential scaffolds for PCa cell culturing was investigated by means of synchrotron X-ray computed micro tomography (SXCμT) fitting the according requirements of high spatial resolution, 3D imaging capability and low dose requirements very well. In combination with mechanical tests, the results allowed identifying an optimal cryogel architecture, meeting the needs for a well-suited scaffold to be used for 3D PCa cell culture applications.

The mobility domain, in particular, showed consistently large DIF across cancer type, sex, and age.  Conclusions:   Given the use of the instrument in health status assessments across conditions and interventions, these results may have significant implications for the EQ-5D in health economic evaluations.

However, the coding quality for outpatient cancer diagnoses remains unclear. In this study, we examined the ICD-10 coding quality for outpatient breast, prostate and colorectal cancer diagnoses in statutory health insurance (SHI) claims data.  Methods:   The cohort study comprised 34,756 members of the BARMER GEK statutory health insurance fund diagnosed with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer in 2012 and with no respective diagnosis in the previous 4 quarters. Using internal validation approaches, we examined the proportion of diagnoses confirmed by persistence (further diagnoses or death) and/or congruence (EBM, OPS and ATC codes).  Results:   The proportion of diagnoses confirmed by a further diagnosis or death within one quarter of follow-up was 69.8 % for breast cancer, 73.0 % for prostate cancer and 64.6 % for colorectal cancer, increasing to 71.8 %, 74.6 % and 68.0 %, respectively, when considering provision of care using EBM, OPS and ATC codes. By extending the diagnosis-free lead time to 16 quarters and the follow-up time to 4 quarters, the proportion rose to 83.9 %, 85.1 % and 75.8 %, respectively. Results varied by sex, age, the Associations of SHI Physicians and settlement pattern.  Conclusions:   Because there were no further indications confirming the incident outpatient cancer diagnoses a proportion of diagnoses remain unconfirmed. When conducting studies based on SHI claims data, these limitations in the ICD coding quality for outpatient cancer diagnoses should be taken into account by using internal validation approaches.""","""['Jonas Czwikla', 'Dominik Domhoff', 'Klaus Giersiepen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes""","""['Quality of diagnostic ICD coding for outpatients in Germany.', 'ICD and OPS.

Due to an overlap of features, prostatitis may mimic prostate cancer on MRI, especially in patients with chronic prostatitis. We retrospectively analysed our in-gantry MRI-guided biopsy (MRGB) results to determine incidental detection rate of prostatitis in Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) 3, 4 and 5 foci reported on diagnostic MRI of the prostate.  Methods:   About 137 patients underwent in-gantry MRGB for lesions with PIRADS score of 3 or above. All the biopsies were performed utilizing the dynaTRIM™ system (Invio Inc, Germany) on a three-tesla MRI scanner (Ingenia 3.0T, Philips, Netherlands) by a Radiologist and a Urologist.  Results:   We biopsied 228 lesions in 137 patients. There were 55 lesions that returned positive for prostate cancer with a Gleason Score of 3 + 3 = 6 or above. There were 62 lesions that showed inflammation. The distribution of these lesions was 3 (5%) in the central zone, 32 (52%) in the transitional zone and 27 (43%) in the peripheral zone. Inflammation was found in 36 (58%) PIRADS 3 lesions, 24 (39%) PIRADS 4 lesions and 2 (3%) PIRADS 5 lesions on pre biopsy MRI evaluation.  Conclusion:   In our series, biopsies which showed inflammation had a radiological appearance on mpMRI more likely of a PIRADS 3 or 4 lesions with only 3% of PIRADS 5 biopsies showing inflammation. This would suggest that a higher PIRADS score can more reliably differentiate between prostate cancer and prostatitis.""","""['Rajeev Jyoti', 'Noel Hamesh Jina', 'Hodo Z Haxhimolla']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and targeted biopsy, Comparison of PIRADS and Gleason grading.', 'Cancer detection rate of prebiopsy MRI with subsequent systematic and targeted biopsy are superior to non-targeting systematic biopsy without MRI in biopsy naïve patients: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Clinical and multiparametric MRI signatures of granulomatous prostatitis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric (mp) MRI of prostate cancer.', 'False-positive magnetic resonance imaging prostate cancer correlates and clinical implications.', 'Regional Histopathology and Prostate MRI Positivity: A Secondary Analysis of the PROMIS Trial.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'T2 mapping for the characterization of prostate lesions.', 'How to Improve TRUS-Guided Target Biopsy following Prostate MRI.']"""

Until 11/2011, RALP patients were treated with antibiotics administered in the operating room and continued until urethral catheter removal. Since 11/2011, all patients were treated with a single intravenous dose of Cephalosporin and Aminoglycoside given within 30 min of surgical incision. The rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) was evaluated in both groups. 229 RALP patients were identified. The first 60 patients (26.2%) were treated according to the old protocol (Group 1) while the remaining 169 (73.8%) were treated according to the new protocol (Group 2). Group match was identified in all categories but LOS. Moreover, LOS was found to be longer in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (5.8 vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.001). CAUTI rate was similar in both groups (8.3 vs. 8.9%, respectively, p = 0.89). Logistic regression analysis did not demonstrate any association between treatment protocol and potential risk for CAUTI. Therefore, a single preoperative dose of antibiotics does not increase the rate of CAUTI following RALP compared with prolonged antibiotic treatment. Moreover, it was found to be associated with shorter LOS.

Improved substratification could optimize treatment and monitoring strategies. The objective was to validate this subclassification in a radical prostatectomy (RP) series.  Methods:   Between 2000 and 2011, 4038 patients who underwent RP for intermediate-risk PCa in seven French academic centers were included. Unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) PCa was defined as having a primary Gleason score of 4, ≥50% positive biopsy cores (PPBC), or more than one D'Amico intermediate-risk factor (i.e., cT2b, PSA 10-20, or Gleason score 7). Remaining PCa cases were classified as favorable. Main endpoints were pathologic results (pT stage, final Gleason score, surgical margin status), and oncologic outcomes were assessed according to PSA recurrence-free survival (PSA-RFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Median follow-up was 48 months (95% CI = [45-49]). Patients with UIR had worse PSA-RFS (68.17 vs. 81.98% at 4 years, HR = 1.97, 95% CI = [1.71; 2.27], p < 0.0001) compared to those with a favorable disease. The need for adjuvant therapy was significantly greater for UIR patients (43.5 vs. 29.2%, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, primary Gleason score of 4 (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = [1.55; 2.12], p < 0.0001) and PPBC ≥ 50% (HR = 1.26, 95% CI = [1.02; 1.56], p = 0.0286) were significant preoperative predictors for worse PSA-RFS.  Conclusions:   This study highlights the heterogeneity of NCCN intermediate-risk patients and validates (in a large RP cohort) the previously proposed subclassification for this group.

Although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood, CGRs have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Here, we introduce CouGaR, a novel method for characterizing the genomic structure of amplified CGRs, leveraging both depth of coverage (DOC) and discordant pair-end mapping techniques. We applied our method to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identify amplified CGRs in at least 5.2% (10+ copies) to 17.8% (6+ copies) of the samples. Furthermore, ∼95% of these amplified CGRs contain genes previously implicated in tumorigenesis, indicating the importance and widespread occurrence of CGRs in cancers. Additionally, CouGaR identified the occurrence of 'chromoplexy' in nearly 63% of all prostate cancer samples and 30% of all bladder cancer samples. To further validate the accuracy of our method, we experimentally tested 17 predicted fusions in two pediatric glioma samples and validated 15 of these (88%) with precise resolution of the breakpoints via qPCR experiments and Sanger sequencing, with nearly perfect copy count concordance.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether ADT is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for community-acquired pneumonia in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This was a population-based cohort study using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics repository. The cohort consisted of 20 310 men newly diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2015. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for hospitalisation for community-acquired pneumonia associated with current and past use of ADT compared with non-use.  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 621 incident hospitalisations for community-acquired pneumonia (incidence rate: 7.2/1000 person-years). Current ADT use was associated with an 81% increased risk of hospitalisation for community-acquired pneumonia (12.1 vs 3.8 per 1000 person-years, respectively; HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.23). The association was observed within the first six months of use (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.42) and remained elevated with increasing durations of use (≥25 months; HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.30). In contrast, past ADT use was not associated with an increased risk (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.60).

The duration of active surveillance as well as the causes of discontinuing the protocol and the definitive pathological results of patients who further underwent radical prostatectomy were retrospectively evaluated. The predictors of discontinuing active surveillance were assessed using a univariable Cox Model. In addition, the predictive value of initial MRI was assessed for patients who performed such imagery.

Materials and methods:   The study included 2,653 patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) at a single institution between 2006 and 2011. The evaluated outcomes were biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical recurrence (CR). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the association between time from diagnosis to RP and oncological outcomes. Nonparametric curve fitting methods were used to graphically explore the relationship between time from diagnosis to RP and oncological outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were repeated in the subgroups of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients.  Results:   At median follow-up of 56 months (interquartile range: 26, 92), 283 patients experienced BCR, and 84 patients developed CR. Median time from PCa diagnosis to surgery was 2.8 months (interquartile range: 1.6, 4.7). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, time from biopsy to RP was significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.02, P = 0.0005) and CR (hazard ratio = 1.03, P = 0.0002). Using Nonparametric curve fitting methods, a significant increased risk of BCR and CR after approximately 18 months was observed. However, when sensitivity analyses were repeated according to risk groups, this effect was maintained in high-risk patients only, and such time interval was reduced to 12 months.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog inactivation is implicated in prostate cancer progression, and upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway can lead to tumor hypoxia and radioresistance. Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with both antitumor and radiosensitizing effects.  Methods and materials:   We performed a phase 1 study using a modified 3 + 3 dose-escalation design to evaluate the safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with standard SRT for the treatment of biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy. After a 2-week run-in period of everolimus daily therapy, patients received prostate bed irradiation with daily cone beam computed tomography localization in 37 fractions of 1.8 Gy each (total dose, 66.6 Gy). Patients were monitored for both acute (≤90 days) and chronic (>90 days) treatment-related toxicities.  Results:   Eighteen patients received everolimus at dose levels of 5 mg (n=6), 7.5 mg (n=6), or 10 mg (n=6) daily in conjunction with SRT. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed.

Coatomer complex I (COPI)-coated vesicles are involved in the transport between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Several studies indicated that some subunits of COPI were correlated with the cell proliferation of malignant tumors. The present study focused on the function of coatomer protein complex subunit β 2 (COPB2), one of seven proteins in COPI, in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   COPB2 gene expression was first analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 15 paired PCa and carcinoma adjacent normal tissue from patients. To investigate the role of COPB2 in PCa, we used lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown COPB2 expression in human PCa cell line PC-3 and assessed it by RT-qPCR. Cellomics ArrayScan VTI imaging and colony formation were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Cell cycle phase arrest and apoptosis were assayed by flow cytometry.  Results:   COPB2 gene was upregulated in the PCa tissue. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in COPB2-silenced PC-3 cells using both Cellomics ArrayScan VTI imaging and colony formation assays. S-phase cell counts were significantly decreased; G1- and G2-phase cell counts were significantly increased in COPB2-siRNA group than the control group. Apoptosis was significantly increased in COPB2-siRNA cells.  Conclusions:   COPB2 significantly promoted PC-3 cell proliferation and colony formation through the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway. Moreover, COPB2 showed a clinical correlation and may serve as a biomarker for the detection for PCa.""","""['Yuanyuan Mi', 'Menglei Yu', 'Lifeng Zhang', 'Chuanyu Sun', 'Bingbing Wei', 'Weihong Ding', 'Yingfeng Zhu', 'Jianmin Tang', 'Guowei Xia', 'Lijie Zhu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arch Med Res""","""['Coatomer subunit beta 2 (COPB2), identified by label-free quantitative proteomics, regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Silencing of COPB2 inhibits the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and induces apoptosis via suppression of the RTK signaling pathway.', 'Downregulation of COPB2 by RNAi inhibits growth of human cholangiocellular carcinoma cells.', 'COPB2: a transport protein\xa0with multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression.', 'Malignant changes in the prostate with ageing.', 'SENP6-Mediated deSUMOylation of VEGFR2 Enhances Its Cell Membrane Transport in Angiogenesis.', 'Depletion of COPI in cancer cells: the role of reactive oxygen species in the induction of lipid accumulation, noncanonical lipophagy and apoptosis.', 'Upregulation of COPB2 Promotes Prostate Cancer Proliferation and Invasion Through the MAPK/TGF-β Signaling Pathway.', 'Lysine demethylase 5A promotes prostate adenocarcinoma progression by suppressing microRNA-330-3p expression and activating the COPB2/PI3K/AKT axis in an ETS1-dependent manner.', 'Implication of COPB2 Expression on Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Pathogenesis.']"""

These survivors' shared thoughts and views were hypothesized to reflect salient features of their lived social representation of prostate cancer.  Context:   We explored the content of testimonies posted by men to a public blog hosted by a French national prostate cancer patients' association. The study question, ""What do French bloggers' testimonies reveal about their lived experiences with prostate cancer, especially regarding their quality of life in community settings, that underpin their social representation of prostate cancer?"" guided the exploration and analysis of the textual data. The aims were to better understand men's experiences and predominant thoughts and views, to elucidate patients' behaviours, and to enlighten medical policy and practice.  Purpose:   Explore issues of QOL as reported by French prostate cancer survivors in a public blog by: (a) identifying the salient aspects and issues of the experience of living with prostate cancer from the perspective of survivors; and (b) analyzing the content in the posted testimonies regarding perceived and lived impacts of prostate cancer on QOL.  Methods:   A critical ethnographic study guided the selection of textual data from 196 male bloggers' testimonies about prostate cancer posted in the period from 2008 to 2013. Media content analysis method was undertaken on blog testimonies, framed by a multidimensional conceptual framework of QOL.  Results:   Testimonies focused mainly on medical care and rehabilitation, recovery, health education and self-care, as well as on a global vision of prostate cancer and its impacts on personal views of manhood and masculinity. The language used indicated that political, educative and compassionate discourses were intertwined to create a complex representation of the experience and effects of prostate cancer; this multi-faceted representation can inform the public and professional debate about men's capacity to provide emotional support and problem-solve within a community of interest.  Conclusion:   Findings, while based on data limited to mostly one-time entries to a French blog, contribute to understanding a unique, collective expression of men's lived experiences of prostate cancer.

In an initial screen, miRNAs were found to be globally down-regulated in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and primary tumours. Exposure of PCa cell lines to a demethylating agent, 5-Aza-CdR resulted in an increase in the expression levels of miRNAs in general. Using stringent filtering criteria miR-130a was identified as the most promising candidate and selected for validation analyses in our patient series. Down-regulation of miR-130a was associated with promoter hypermethylation. MiR-130a methylation levels discriminated PCa from non-malignant tissues (AUC = 0.956), and urine samples revealed high specificity for non-invasive detection of patients with PCa (AUC = 0.89). Additionally, repressive histone marks were also found in the promoter of miR-130a. Over-expression of miR-130a in PCa cells reduced cell viability and invasion capability, and increased apoptosis. Putative targets of miR-130a were assessed by microarray expression profiling and DEPD1C and SEC23B were selected for validation.

Proponents of active surveillance for low risk disease and critics of watchful waiting for higher risk disease have advocated for more judicious use of observation. Thus, we compared 2 population based cohorts to determine how expectant management has evolved during the last 2 decades.  Materials and methods:   A total of 5,871 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in the PCOS (Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study) or the CEASAR (Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation) study. We compared the use of definitive treatment vs expectant management (watchful waiting or active surveillance) across cohorts, focusing on the influence of disease risk, age and comorbidities.  Results:   Use of watchful waiting or active surveillance was similar in PCOS and CEASAR (14% in each). Compared to the PCOS, more men in the CEASAR study with low risk disease selected watchful waiting or active surveillance (25% vs 15%, respectively), whereas fewer men with intermediate (7% vs 14%) and high risk (3% vs 10%) disease chose watchful waiting or active surveillance (p <0.001 for each). The association of disease risk with watchful waiting or active surveillance was significantly larger in CEASAR than in PCOS (OR 7.3, 95% CI 3.4 to 15.7). Older age was associated with watchful waiting or active surveillance in both cohorts but there was no association between comorbidity and watchful waiting or active surveillance in the CEASAR study.  Conclusions:   Use of watchful waiting or active surveillance was more aligned with disease risk in CEASAR compared to PCOS, suggesting there has been a pivot from watchful waiting to active surveillance. While older men were more likely to be observed, comorbidity had little, if any, influence.""","""['J B Eifler', 'J Alvarez', 'T Koyama', 'R M Conwill', 'C R Ritch', 'K E Hoffman', 'M J Resnick', 'D F Penson', 'D A Barocas;Collaborators']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Population based study of use and determinants of active surveillance and watchful waiting for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Population-based assessment of determining predictors for quality of prostate cancer surveillance.', 'Population-Based Assessment of Determining Treatments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Expectant management for men with early stage prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of an urinary biomarker panel in combination with MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Interpretation of Domain Scores on the EPIC-How Does the Domain Score Translate into Functional Outcomes?', 'Quality of care and economic considerations of active surveillance of men with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer management choices in patients undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy compared to systematic biopsy.']"""

Although it provides survival benefits, it is associated with significant side effects. Novel therapeutic options are needed for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and an approach is combining docetaxel with chemosensitizing agents. Metformin has been shown to improve the survival of patients with breast, lung and endometrial cancer receiving chemotherapy, and enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer and colon cancer cells. However, to our knowledge the chemosensitizing effect of metformin in prostate cancer has not been explored. Therefore, the hypothesis for our study was that diabetic patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who were administered metformin during docetaxel chemotherapy would have improved prostate cancer specific and overall survival.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study used data from several Ontario administrative health care databases. Men older than 65 years diagnosed with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and treated with docetaxel were stratified into groups based on diabetes status and use of antidiabetic medications. We evaluated the effect of metformin use with docetaxel on prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the log rank test and multivariate Cox proportional HRs.  Results:   Survival curves showed that metformin use with docetaxel did not improve prostate cancer specific survival (p = 0.9562) or overall survival (p = 0.9927). HRs showed no significant effect of metformin use with docetaxel on prostate cancer specific survival (HR = 0.96, p = 0.66) or overall survival (HR = 0.94, p = 0.39).  Conclusions:   Metformin use during docetaxel chemotherapy did not significantly improve prostate cancer specific or overall survival in diabetic patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

Twenty-five prostate patients underwent CT and MR simulation scans in treatment position on a 3T MR scanner. A commercially available MR protocol was used that included a T2w turbo spin-echo sequence for soft-tissue contrast and a dual echo 3D mDIXON fast field echo (FFE) sequence for generating syn-CT. A dual-echo 3D FFE B 0 map was used for patient-induced susceptibility distortion analysis and a new 3D balanced-FFE sequence was evaluated for identification of implanted gold fiducial markers and subsequent image-guidance during radiotherapy delivery. Tissues were classified as air, adipose, water, trabecular/spongy bone and compact/cortical bone and assigned bulk HU values. The accuracy of syn-CT for treatment planning was analyzed by transferring the structures and plan from planning CT to syn-CT and recalculating the dose. Accuracy of localization at the treatment machine was evaluated by comparing registration of kV radiographs to either digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from syn-CT or traditional DRRs generated from the planning CT. Similarly, accuracy of setup using CBCT and syn-CT was compared to that using the planning CT. Finally, a MR-only simulation workflow was established and end-to-end testing was completed on five patients undergoing MR-only simulation. Dosimetric comparison between the original CT and syn-CT plans was within 0.5% on average for all structures. The de-novo optimized plans on the syn-CT met institutional clinical objectives for target and normal structures.

In this study, we investigated the anticancer effect of A. graveolens on the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP. LNCaP cells were treated with increasing concentrations of an ethanolic extract of A. graveolens ranging from 1000 to 3000 μg/mL, and viability was determined after 24 and 48 h using the XTT cell proliferation assay. The levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), one of the best biomarkers of apoptosis, were analyzed. Finally, quantitative gene expression analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a critical mediator of angiogenesis, was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A. graveolens extract inhibited cell viability in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Data from cleaved PARP assays suggested that A. graveolens caused induction of apoptosis in these cells. Treatment of cells with A. graveolens also resulted in downregulation of VEGF expression. This study showed that the antiproliferative effect exerted by an ethanolic extract of A. graveolens is triggered by induction of apoptosis.

Patients and methods:   In all, 131 consecutive patients were referred to our centre for a 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the setting of recurring prostate cancer. Of these patients, 11/131(8%) presented with persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy, while 120/131 (92%) were referred for biochemical recurrence after surgery, radiotherapy or both. The images where taken 1 h after injection of 2 MBq/kg of the 68 Ga-(HBED-CC)-PSMA ligand. All examinations were interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists. Using the results of the examination, a multidisciplinary oncology committee (MOC) reported on the treatment strategy. A positive impact on clinical management was considered if the examination determined a modification in the treatment strategy compared to the MOC decision before PSMA imaging.  Results:   All patients completed the examination with no adverse reactions. The median (interquartile range) PSA level at the time of the examination was 2.2 (0.72-6.7) ng/mL. Overall, 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected at least one lesion suspicious for prostate cancer in 98/131 (75%) patients. There was an impact on subsequent management in 99/131 patients (76%).

Materials and methods:   The expression of TRIM59 in prostate cancer tissues (n = 15) and prostate cancer cell lines was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. A specific shRNA targeting TRIM59 was employed to knockdown TRIM59 expression in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. The effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell proliferation were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and colony formation assays. The effects on cell cycle progression were determined by flow cytometry, and a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer was generated to determine the in vivo effects of TRIM59 knockdown. The effects on cell cycle regulators were determined by Western blotting.  Results:   TRIM59 was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues. Knockdown of TRIM59 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and cell cycle analysis showed that TRIM59-depleted cells accumulated in S-phase. TRIM59 knockdown was shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in mice. In addition, the cell cycle regulators CDC25A, CDC2, and cyclin B1 were decreased by TRIM59 shRNA-mediated knockdown.

However, it is difficult to recognize the prostatic outline using CT alone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can depict the prostatic outline better than CT. In treatment plans using CT and MRI registration, various markers are used in institutions; however, the selection of an optimal marker size is difficult. Comparison of a different fiducial marker study was conducted using phantom, but no study in vivo was found. Therefore, we prospectively investigated the effects of different marker diameter sizes using CT and MR images.  Methods:   Thirty-one consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. CT and MRI were performed 3 weeks after marker placement. The 0.35-mm-diameter marker was placed on the left side of the prostate, and the 0.5-mm-diameter marker was placed on the right side. The length of each marker was 10 mm. The better MRI image was selected between those obtained using T2*-two-dimensional weighted image (T2*2D) and T2*-three-dimensional weighted image (T2*3D). Two observers evaluated and scored the prostatic outline image quality as well as visualized the prostatic markers using CT and MRI.  Results:   MRI was significantly superior to CT in depicting the prostatic outline. The CT artifacts were significantly lesser for the 0.35-mm-diameter marker than for the 0.5-mm-diameter marker. The degree of marker recognition using MRI was significantly better with the 0.5-mm-diameter marker.  Conclusion:   The 0.5-mm-diameter fiducial marker had significantly better visualization than the 0.35-mm-diameter marker. While CT artifacts were significantly worse with the 0.5-mm-diameter marker, the artifact level was tolerable for clinical practice.

In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.  Methods:   The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide. Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).  Results:   Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).

We measured the proportion of patients reporting frequent worry about cancer recurrence or progression and examined the association between worry about cancer recurrence or progression to benefit finding and functioning in cancer.  Methods:   We surveyed 594 long-term (5-10 years post-diagnosis) survivors of cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma) in this cross-sectional study. The survey asked about worry about cancer recurrence/progression, negative effects of cancer on mental and physical function, and benefit finding as a result of the cancer (positive effects). Multivariate regressions estimated associations of worry about cancer with negative and positive effects of cancer.  Results:   Worrying about cancer often or all the time was reported by 19.6% of survivors. Worry about cancer was related to worse functioning (odds ratio (OR) range 1.40 to 1.46, all p's < .01). Worry about recurrence/progression was unrelated to benefit finding (all p's > .10).  Conclusions:   Worry about cancer was associated with negative, but not positive, effects of cancer.

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) provides a potential tool for the study of cancer cell dynamics, but faces the challenge that most cancer cells lack sufficient endogenous contrast. Here, a type of colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are physically fabricated and are precisely functionalized with quantitative amounts of functional ligands (i.e., polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and (Arginine(R)-Glycine(G)-Aspartic(D))4 (RGD) peptides) to serve as an exogenous contrast agent for PAI of single cells. The functionalized AuNPs, with a fixed number of PEG but different RGD densities, are delivered into human prostate cancer cells. Radioactivity and photoacoustic analyses show that, although cellular uptake efficiency of the AuNPs linearly increases along with RGD density, photoacoustic signal generation efficiency does not and only maximize at a moderate RGD density. The functionalization of the AuNPs is in turn optimized based on the experimental finding, and single cancer cells are imaged using a custom photoacoustic microscopy with high-resolution.

Indeed, advanced and metastatic disease characterized by androgen resistance and often associated with neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation remains incurable. Using the spontaneous prostate cancer TRAMP model, we have shown that mast cells (MCs) support in vivo the growth of prostate adenocarcinoma, whereas their genetic or pharmacologic targeting favors prostate NE cancer arousal. Aiming at simultaneously targeting prostate NE tumor cells and MCs, both expressing the cKit tyrosine kinase receptor, we have tested the therapeutic effect of imatinib in TRAMP mice. Imatinib-treated TRAMP mice experience a partial benefit against prostate adenocarcinoma, because of inhibition of supportive MCs. However, they show an unexpected outgrowth of prostate NE tumors, likely because of defective signaling pathway downstream of cKit receptor. Also unexpected but very effective was the inhibition of epithelial-stromal tumors of the seminal vesicles achieved by imatinib treatment. These tumors normally arise in the seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice, independently of the degree of prostatic glandular lesions, and resemble phyllodes tumors found in human prostate and seminal vesicles, and in breast. In both mice and in patients, these tumors are negative for cKit but express PDGFR-β, another tyrosine kinase receptor specifically inhibited by imatinib. Our results imply a possible detrimental effect of imatinib in prostate cancer patients but suggest a promising therapeutic application of imatinib in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic phyllodes tumors.

Whole-cell currents in PC3 cells were inhibited by the compounds tested in patch-clamp experiments in a concentration-dependent manner. In all cases [Ca2+]i was increased by modulator concentrations comparable to those used clinically. The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to Ami, Fur, Lox, and Min was reduced significantly (P < 0.01) when the external calcium was reduced to nM concentration by chelation with EGTA.

Our aim was to assess the rates of cancer growth and regression using the comparator groups of eight randomised clinical trials that enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this retrospective analysis, we used data from eight randomised clinical trials with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer to estimate the growth (g) and regression (d) rates of disease burden over time. Rates were obtained by applying mathematical models to prostate-specific antigen levels as the representation of tumour quantity. Rates were compared between study interventions (prednisone, mitoxantrone, and docetaxel) and off-treatment data when on-study treatment had been discontinued to understand disease behaviour during treatment and after discontinuation. Growth (g) was examined for association with a traditional endpoint (overall survival) and for its potential use as an endpoint to reduce sample size in clinical trials.  Findings:   Estimates for g, d, or both were obtained in 2353 (88%) of 2678 patients with data available for analysis; g differentiated docetaxel (a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy) from prednisone and mitoxantrone and was predictive of overall survival in a landmark analysis at 8 months. A simulated sample size analysis, in which g was used as the endpoint, compared docetaxel data with mitoxantrone data and showed that small sample sizes were sufficient to achieve 80% power (16, 47, and 25 patients, respectively, in the three docetaxel comparator groups). Similar results were found when the mitoxantrone data were compared with the prednisone data (41, 39, and 41 patients in the three mitoxantrone comparator groups). Finally, after discontinuation of docetaxel therapy, median tumour growth (g) increased by nearly five times.  Interpretation:   The application of mathematical models to existing clinical data allowed estimation of rates of growth and regression that provided new insights in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The availability of clinical data through initiatives such as Project Data Sphere, when combined with innovative modelling techniques, could greatly enhance our understanding of how cancer responds to treatment, and accelerate the productivity of clinical development programmes.

Objective:   To evaluate if expanding the positivity criteria to include both nuclear and cytoplasmic AR-V7 localization (""nuclear-agnostic"") identifies more patients who would benefit from a taxane over an ARSi.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study used a cross-sectional cohort. Between December 2012 and March 2015, 193 pretherapy blood samples, 191 of which were evaluable, were collected and processed from 161 unique mCRPC patients before starting a new line of systemic therapy for disease progression at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The association between two AR-V7 scoring criteria, post-therapy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change (PTPC) and OS following ARSi or taxane treatment, was explored. One criterion required nuclear-specific AR-V7 localization, and the other required an AR-V7 signal but was agnostic to protein localization in CTCs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Correlation of AR-V7 status to PTPC and OS was investigated. Relationships with survival were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank analyses.  Results and limitations:   A total of 34 (18%) samples were AR-V7-positive using nuclear-specific criteria, and 56 (29%) were AR-V7-positive using nuclear-agnostic criteria. Following ARSi treatment, none of the 16 nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive samples and six of the 32 (19%) nuclear-agnostic AR-V7-positive samples had ≥50% PTPC at 12 weeks. The strongest baseline factor influencing OS was the interaction between the presence of nuclear-specific AR-V7-positive CTCs and treatment with a taxane (hazard ratio 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.078-0.79; p=0.019). This interaction was not significant when nuclear-agnostic criteria were used.  Conclusions:   To reliably inform treatment selection using an AR-V7 protein biomarker in CTCs, nuclear-specific localization is required.  Patient summary:   We analyzed outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on androgen receptor signaling inhibitors and standard chemotherapy. Patients with circulating tumor cells that had AR-V7 protein in the cellular nuclei were very likely to survive longer on taxane-based chemotherapy, and tests unable to distinguish where the protein is located in the cell are not as predictive of benefit.""","""['Howard I Scher', 'Ryon P Graf', 'Nicole A Schreiber', 'Brigit McLaughlin', 'David Lu', 'Jessica Louw', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Lyndsey Dugan', 'Ann Johnson', 'Glenn Heller', 'Martin Fleisher', 'Ryan Dittamore']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Practical Polling for Prostate Cancer: AR-V7-based Treatment Selection.', 'Association of AR-V7 on Circulating Tumor Cells as a Treatment-Specific Biomarker With Outcomes and Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Utility of the Nuclear-localized AR-V7 Biomarker in Circulating Tumor Cells in Improving Physician Treatment Choice in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'RNA profiling of circulating tumor cells systemically captured from diagnostic leukapheresis products in prostate cancer patients.']"""

It is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and has been suggested as a target for antibody-based radioligand therapy. As PSMA expression so far has not been systematically analyzed in soft tissue tumors, the current study aims at investigating a large cohort of different subtypes.  Methods and results:   Immunohistochemistry was used to detect PSMA expression in 779 samples of soft tissue tumors and Ewing sarcoma as a primary bone malignancy. CD34 coexpression was employed to study PSMA expression in the neovasculature. PSMA expression was found in the tumor-associated neovasculature of 151/779 soft tissue/bone tumors (19.38%) and was more frequent in malignant tumors compared to tumors with intermediate or benign biological potential (p=0.078). Strong neovascular PSMA expression was predominantly observed in subsets of different sarcomas including 3/20 rhabdomyosarcomas (15%), 4/21 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (19.05%), 6/16 synovial sarcomas (35.29%) and 6/33 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (18.18%).

Nanobubbles, with an average diameter of 353.3 ± 15.5 nm, entered two different castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC3 and DU145) as demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. The shock waves applied increased the amount of intracellular nanobubbles. Loading nanobubbles with paclitaxel and docetaxel and combining them with shock waves generated the highest cytotoxic effects, resulting in a paclitaxel GI50 reduction of about 55% and in a docetaxel GI50 reduction of about 45% respectively. Combined treatment also affected cell migration. Paclitaxel-loaded nanobubbles and shock waves reduced cell migration by more than 85% with respect to paclitaxel alone; whereas docetaxel-loaded nanobubbles and shock waves reduced cell migration by more than 82% with respect to docetaxel alone.

Here we investigate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted nanoparticle based on a poly(lactic acid)-polyethylene glycol copolymer by utilizing single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and fluorescence imaging of a low-molecular-weight, PSMA-targeting moiety attached to the surface and oriented toward the outside environment. Tissue biodistribution of the radioactive, PSMA-targeted nanoparticles in mice containing PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu (control) tumors demonstrated similar accumulation compared to the untargeted particles within all tissues except for the tumor and liver by 96 h postinjection. For PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor, the targeted nanoparticle demonstrated retention of 6.58% injected dose (ID)/g at 48 h and remained nearly at that level out to 96 h, whereas the untargeted nanoparticle showed a 48 h retention of 8.17% ID/g followed by a significant clearance to 2.37% ID/g at 96 h (P < 0.02). On the other hand, for control tumor, both targeted and untargeted particles displayed similar 48 h retentions and rates of clearance over 96 h. Ex vivo microscopic analysis with near-infrared versions of the nanoparticles indicated retention within PSMA(+) tumor epithelial cells as well as tumor-associated macrophages for targeted particles and primarily macrophage-associated uptake for the untargeted particles. Retention in control tumor was primarily associated with tumor vasculature and macrophages. The data demonstrate the utility of radioimaging to assess nanoparticle biodistribution and suggest that active targeting has a modest positive effect on tumor localization of PSMA-targeted PLA-PEG nanoparticles that have been derivatized for imaging.""","""['Sangeeta R Banerjee', 'Catherine A Foss', 'Allen Horhota', 'Mrudula Pullambhatla', 'Kevin McDonnell', 'Stephen Zale', 'Martin G Pomper']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Dual-Modality Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer with a Radiolabeled Fluorescent Anti-PSMA Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies specific to the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen: preclinical studies in nude mice bearing LNCaP human prostate tumor.', 'Evaluation of a PSMA-targeted BNF nanoparticle construct.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Meeting report from the Prostate Cancer Foundation PSMA-directed radionuclide scientific working group.', 'Emerging biomedical imaging-based companion diagnostics for precision medicine.', 'Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells Are Frequently Found in the Urine of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Approaches to Improve EPR-Based Drug Delivery for Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.']"""

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of SMSG can present diagnostic challenges. The current report presents the largest such FNAB series to date.  Methods:   A search of the pathology database from 6 academic institutions identified 184 FNAB cases of nonlymphomatous SMSG.  Results:   Of the 184 cases, 171 were of the parotid glands, and 13 were of the submandibular glands; 130 patients were men, and 54 were women, and the mean patient age at diagnosis was 68 years. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from all sites (n = 87) and melanoma (n = 67) constituted the majority of SMSGs. Less frequent SMSGs were comprised of metastatic carcinomas from distant organs (n = 16), including sites in the breast, lung, kidney, thyroid, pancreatobiliary, prostate, and bladder. Other uncommon SMSGs, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 4), other metastatic skin-derived carcinomas (n = 6), and metastatic chordoma (n = 1), also were observed. Ancillary tests were performed on 37 FNAB specimens (20.1%) to aid the evaluation. One hundred forty-seven specimens (79.9%) had a definitive diagnosis with accurate tumor subtyping, 21 (11.4%) had a definitive malignant diagnosis but without specifying subtype, 9 (4.9%) had an indeterminate diagnosis, and 7 (3.8%) had a false-negative diagnosis.  Conclusions:   SMSGs originate predominately from the head and neck and are more common in older men. Overall, the FNAB diagnosis of SMSG is accurate, but diagnostic challenges can be encountered, especially in SCC types of SMSG.

Its use is increasing, but concerns remain about treatment-related toxicity. The authors assessed the incidence and predictors of a global decline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after prostate SBRT.  Methods:   From 2008 to 2014, 713 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer received treatment with SBRT according to a prospective institutional protocol. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) HRQOL data were collected at baseline and longitudinally for 5 years. EPIC-26 is comprised of 5 domains. The primary endpoint was defined as a decline exceeding the clinically detectable threshold in ≥4 EPIC-26 domains, termed multidomain decline.  Results:   The median age was 69 years, 46% of patients had unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, and 20% received androgen-deprivation therapy. During 1 to 3 months and 6 to 60 months after SBRT, 8% to 15% and 10% to 11% of patients had multidomain declines, respectively. On multivariable analysis, lower baseline bowel HRQOL (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7; P < .01) and baseline depression (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-24.3; P = .02) independently predicted for multidomain decline. Only 3% to 4% of patients had long-term multidomain declines exceeding twice the clinical threshold, and 30% of such declines appeared to be related to prostate cancer treatment or progression of disease.  Conclusions:   Prostate SBRT has minimal long-term impact on multidomain decline, and the majority of more significant multidomain declines appear to be unrelated to treatment. This emphasizes the importance of focusing not only on the side effects of prostate cancer treatment but also on other comorbid illnesses that contribute to overall HRQOL.

However, fewer studies have focused on less invasive and commonly acquired blood samples. Recent studies have shown the ability of Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to discriminate between non-cancer controls and cancer cases using blood serum or plasma. Even though many studies have proposed Raman spectroscopy as a potential diagnostic tool in various cancers, the Raman spectroscopic technique has not been introduced as a routine clinical technology. This is due to multiple drawbacks with the application of the technique, including sample preparation, the requirement for expensive substrates and long acquisition times. The current study aims to overcome these limitations and focuses on the translation of Raman spectroscopy into a high throughput clinical diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. In this study, the effect of different instrumental and sample preparation parameters were investigated, with the aim of identifying a combination that would reduce the overall acquisition time for spectra from peripheral blood plasma, reduce the complexity of sample preparation and retain the classification accuracy from Raman spectroscopic diagnostics. A high throughput (HT) system was developed and Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed on plasma samples from 10 prostate cancer patients and 10 healthy volunteers. The spectra were pre-processed and classified by principal component analysis - linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) in the R environment. Statistically significant differences were observed between Raman spectra of prostate cancer patients and non-cancer controls.

However, the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic effects of matrine on castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain unknown. This study investigated the anti-metastatic effects of matrine on CRPC to identify the underlying mechanisms. The effects of matrine on the cell viability of DU145 and PC-3 cells were measured using MTS assay. The impact of matrine on expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunit p65 and phosphorylated p65 in cells untreated or treated with matrine were analyzed by western blotting. The inhibitory effects of matrine on cell migration and invasion were examined by Transwell assay. The impact of matrine on tumorigenesis in male Balb/c nude mice inoculated subcutaneously with cells were investigated in vivo. We found that matrine inhibited the growth of DU145 and PC3 cells time- and dose-dependently both in vitro and in vivo. Migration and invasion capabilities of cells were also suppressed by matrine. At the same time, matrine markedly reduced the expression levels of MMP-9, MMP-2 and p-p65 in both cell lines. Further experiments revealed that matrine exhibited inhibitory effects of migration and invasion of CRPC by downregulating MMP-2/9 through NF-κB pathway. Matrine inhibits invasion of CRPC by reducing levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 through NF-κB pathway. Therefore, it may be a potential anti-metastatic therapeutic agent for CRPC.""","""['Hai Huang', 'Tao Du', 'Guibin Xu', 'Yiming Lai', 'Xinxing Fan', 'Xianju Chen', 'Wenjiao Li', 'Fei Yue', 'Qi Li', 'Leyuan Liu', 'Kaiwen Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Matrine inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Identification of Matrine as a Novel Regulator of the CXCR4 Signaling Axis in Tumor Cells.', 'Matrine inhibiting pancreatic cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion through ROS/NF-κB/MMPs pathway.', 'Advance in studies on anti-tumor mechanism of matrine.', 'Recent research progress of anti-tumor mechnism matrine.', 'Identification of the Mechanism of Matrine Combined with Glycyrrhizin for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment through Network Pharmacology and Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Psoralen Promotes Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Human Extravillous Trophoblast Derived HTR-8/Svneo Cells in vitro by NF-κB Pathway.', 'Matrine Combined with Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Inhibitor Enhances Anti-Tumor Efficacy of dendritic cell Vaccines in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Modulation of TLR/NF-κB/NLRP Signaling by Bioactive Phytocompounds: A Promising Strategy to Augment Cancer Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy.', 'Matrine Exerts Pharmacological Effects Through Multiple Signaling Pathways: A Comprehensive Review.']"""

This study aimed to improve CTC detection in non-metastatic PCa patients by combining three independent CTC assays: the CellSearch system, an in vivo CellCollector and the EPISPOT. Peripheral blood samples from high-risk PCa patients were screened for CTCs before and three months after radical prostatectomy (RP). Combining the results of both time points, CTCs were detected in 37%, 54.9% and 58.7% of patients using CellSearch, CellCollector and EPISPOT, respectively. The cumulative positivity rate of the three CTC assays was 81.3% (87/107) with 21.5% (23/107) of patients harboring ≥5 CTCs/7.5 ml blood. Matched pair analysis of 30 blood samples taken before and after surgery indicated a significant decrease in CTCs captured by the CellCollector from 66% before RP to 34% after therapy (p = 0.031). CTC detection by EPISPOT before RP significantly correlated with PSA serum values (p < 0.0001) and clinical tumor stage (p = 0.04), while the other assays showed no significant correlations.

Little is known about communication between health providers and African-American prostate cancer patients, a high risk population, regarding the health benefits of regular physical activity on their prognosis and recovery. This study explores African-American prostate cancer survivors' experiences with physical activity prescription from their physicians.  Methods:   Three focus group interviews were conducted with 12 African-American prostate cancer survivors in May 2014 in St. Louis, MO. Participants' ages ranged from 49 to 79 years, had completed radical prostatectomy, and their time out of surgery varied from 7 to 31 months.  Results:   Emerged themes included physician role on prescribing physical activity, patients' perceived barriers to engaging in physical activity, perception of normalcy following surgery, and specific resources survivors' sought during treatment. Of the 12 men who participated, 8 men (67%) expressed that their physicians did not recommend physical activity for them. Although some participants revealed they were aware of the importance of sustained physical activity on their prognosis and recovery, some expressed concerns that urinary dysfunction, incontinence, and family commitments prevented them from engaging in active lifestyles.  Conclusions:   Transitioning from post radical prostatectomy treatment to normal life was an important concern to survivors.

We have previously shown that chronic and developmental exposure to BPA is associated with increased prostate cancer (PCa) risk in human and animal models. Here, we examine whether exposure of PCa cells (LNCaP, C4-2) to low-dose BPA and its structural analogues (BPS, BPF, BPAF, TBBPA, DMBPA and TMBPA) affects centrosome amplification (CA), a hallmark of cancer initiation and progression. We found that exposure to BPA, BPS, DMBPA and TBBPA, in descending order, increased the number of cells with CA, in a non-monotonic dose-response manner. Furthermore, cells treated with BPA and their analogues initiated centrosome duplication at 8 h after release from serum starvation, significantly earlier in G-1 phase than control cells. This response was attended by earlier release of nucleophosmin from unduplicated centrosomes. BPA-exposed cells exhibited increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 and decreased expression of CDK inhibitors (p21Waf1/CIP1 and p27KIP1). Using specific antagonists for estrogen/androgen receptors, CA in the presence of BPA or its analogues was likely to be mediated via ESR1 signaling. Change in microtubule dynamics was observed on exposure to these analogues, which, for BPA, was accompanied by increased expression of centrosome-associated protein CEP350 Similar to BPA, chronic treatment of cells with DMBPA, but not other analogues, resulted in the enhancement of anchorage-independent growth. We thus conclude that selected BPA analogues, similar to BPA, disrupt centrosome function and microtubule organization, with DMBPA displaying the broadest spectrum of cancer-promoting effects.""","""['Shuk-Mei Ho', 'Rahul Rao', 'Sarah To', 'Emma Schoch', 'Pheruza Tarapore']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Exposure to bisphenol A correlates with early-onset prostate cancer and promotes centrosome amplification and anchorage-independent growth in vitro.', 'Effects of bisphenol analogues on steroidogenic gene expression and hormone synthesis in H295R cells.', 'Structural bisphenol analogues differentially target steroidogenesis in murine MA-10 Leydig cells as well as the glucocorticoid receptor.', 'Neuroendocrine disruption in animal models due to exposure to bisphenol A analogues.', 'A scoping review of the health and toxicological activity of bisphenol A (BPA) structural analogues and functional alternatives.', 'Oxidative stress increases in liver of lactating rats after BPF-low-dose exposure: perinatal effects in the offspring.', 'Re-evaluation of the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Adverse (geno)toxic effects of bisphenol A and its analogues in hepatic 3D cell model.', 'GPER1 links estrogens to centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability in human colon cells.']"""

Glucose-related parameters in patients with aggressive prostate cancer were compared with 2 reference groups: men of similar age and body mass index (BMI) without cancer, and healthy young men. Acute changes in these parameters following radiation treatment were also evaluated.  Methods:   Nine patients with aggressive prostate cancer underwent metabolic assessments prior to treatment (baseline), 7 and 33 weeks post-baseline (post-treatment initiation). Baseline measures were compared with the 2 reference groups. Evaluations included: 1) fasting and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) blood samples for glucose, C-peptide, and insulin, 2) fasting blood samples for triglycerides, cholesterols, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and TNF-α, 3) body composition, 4) nutrition, and 5) physical activity.  Results:   At baseline, patients had normal fasting glucose concentrations (<5.6 mM; 4.9 ± 1.2 mM) but impaired 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations (>7.8 mM; 8.7 ± 2.9 mM). Both reference groups had normal fasting (matched males: 4.2 ± 0.5 mM; young males: 3.7 ± 0.4 mM) and 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations (matched males: 5.6 ± 1.8 mM; young males: 3.1 ± 0.1 mM) that were significantly lower than patient values. During the OGTT, patients had higher insulin (120 min) and C-peptide (45, 60, 90, 120 min) concentrations compared to the matched males. At 7 weeks, 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations in patients improved to healthy ranges without changes in insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 or other metabolic parameters.  Conclusions:   At baseline patients with aggressive prostate cancer demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance compared with men of similar age and body size. Following treatment, glucose tolerance improved in the absence of changes in expected modifiers of glucose metabolism.

We have previously found that the VAR2CSA protein is present on malaria-infected erythrocytes and facilitates a highly specific binding to the placenta. ofCS is absent in other non-malignant tissues and thus VAR2CSA generally facilitates parasite sequestration and accumulation in pregnant women. In this study, we show that the specific receptor for VAR2CSA, the oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS), is likewise present in BL tissue and cell lines. We therefore explored whether ofCS in BL could act as anchor site for VAR2CSA-expressing infected erythrocytes. In contrast to the placenta, we found no evidence of in vivo sequestering of infected erythrocytes in the BL tissue. Furthermore, we found VAR2CSA-specific antibody titers in children with endemic BL to be lower than in control children from the same malaria endemic region. The abundant presence of ofCS in BL tissue and the absence of ofCS in non-malignant tissue encouraged us to examine whether recombinant VAR2CSA could be used to target BL. We confirmed the binding of VAR2CSA to BL-derived cells and showed that a VAR2CSA drug conjugate efficiently killed the BL-derived cell lines in vitro.

The majority of automated approaches have focused on customizing and inferring dose volume objectives to be used in plan optimization. In this work we outline a multi-patient atlas-based dose prediction approach that learns to predict the dose-per-voxel for a novel patient directly from the computed tomography planning scan without the requirement of specifying any objectives. Our method learns to automatically select the most effective atlases for a novel patient, and then map the dose from those atlases onto the novel patient. We extend our previous work to include a conditional random field for the optimization of a joint distribution prior that matches the complementary goals of an accurately spatially distributed dose distribution while still adhering to the desired dose volume histograms. The resulting distribution can then be used for inverse-planning with a new spatial dose objective, or to create typical dose volume objectives for the canonical optimization pipeline. We investigated six treatment sites (633 patients for training and 113 patients for testing) and evaluated the mean absolute difference in all DVHs for the clinical and predicted dose distribution. The results on average are favorable in comparison to our previous approach (1.91 versus 2.57). Comparing our method with and without atlas-selection further validates that atlas-selection improved dose prediction on average in whole breast (0.64 versus 1.59), prostate (2.13 versus 4.07), and rectum (1.46 versus 3.29) while it is less important in breast cavity (0.79 versus 0.92) and lung (1.33 versus 1.27) for which there is high conformity and minimal dose shaping.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the association between ALAN and prostate cancer in 27 districts within Gwangju City and urban and rural areas from South Jeolla Province in South Korea. We analyzed the correlation between ALAN and the incidence of a range of cancers by Poisson regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as smoking, drinking, obesity, stress, air pollution (particulate matter <10 μm in diameter), urbanization (proportion of urbanized area), and the cancer screening rate. Interestingly, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly associated with ALAN (risk ratio = 1.02, p = 0.0369) and urbanization (risk ratio = 1.06, p = 0.0055). In particular, comparing the prostate cancer incidence at 25% and 75% level of ALAN, the risk ratio was 1.726 (12.6 over 7.3, respectively). No significant association was observed between ALAN and other cancers, including stomach, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and tracheal, bladder, and brain and central nervous system cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

DNA was extracted from whole blood from male AHS pesticide applicators (n = 695). Questionnaire data were used to ascertain the occurrence of HPEEs over the participant's lifetime. Pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNAm in CDH1, GSTp1, and MGMT promoters, and in the repetitive element, LINE-1. Linear and robust regression analyses evaluated adjusted associations between HPEE and DNAm. Ever having an HPEE (n = 142; 24%) was associated with elevated DNAm in the GSTp1 promoter at CpG7 (chr11:67,351,134; P < 0.01) and for the mean across the CpGs measured in the GSTp1 promoter (P < 0.01). In stratified analyses, elevated GSTP1 promoter DNAm associated with HPEE was more pronounced among applicators >59 years and those with plasma folate levels ≤16.56 ng/mL (p-interaction <0.01); HPEE was associated with reduced MGMT promoter DNAm at CpG2 (chr10:131,265,803; P = 0.03), CpG3 (chr10:131,265,810; P = 0.05), and the mean across CpGs measured in the MGMT promoter (P = 0.03) among applicators >59 years and reduced LINE-1 DNAm (P = 0.05) among applicators with ≤16.56 ng/mL plasma folate. Non-specific HPEEs may contribute to increased DNAm in GSTp1, and in some groups, reduced DNAm in MGMT and LINE-1.

In this setting, salvage radiotherapy may cure patients with local recurrence, but is unable to cure those with occult metastatic disease. The objective of this study is to examine how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to radiotherapy predicts subsequent disease progression and survival.  Materials and methods:   Using a prospectively populated database of 3089 men who underwent open radical prostatectomy, 212 patients (7%) were identified who received early salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence. The main outcome was time to disease progression after salvage radiotherapy. Patients were stratified by PSA response after radiotherapy: 1) PSA < 0.1 ng/mL, 2) persistently detectable PSA, and 3) rising PSA.  Results:   Patients received salvage radiotherapy at a median PSA of 0.20 ng/mL (IQR 0.10-0.30 ng/mL). At a median follow up of 47.3 months, a total of 52 (25%) patients experienced disease progression. On multivariable analysis, both persistent PSA (HR 5.12; 95% CI 1.98-13.23) and rising PSA (HR 16.55; 95% CI 6.61-41.48) were associated with increased risk of disease progression compared to those with PSA < 0.1 ng/mL after adjusting for pre-radiotherapy PSA, Gleason score, margin status, stage, and time to radiotherapy. Only rising PSA was associated with an increased risk of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality.

Higher grade tumors were identified at the pole in the high stage cohort (p = 0.032). Total percent polar involvement had the greatest sensitivity and specificity for predicting extraprostatic extension when directly compared to previously described histologic parameters (percent greatest involvement of a single core, length of greatest involvement of a single core, presence of perineural invasion, presence of bilateral gland involvement, and percent total positive core involvement). The location of polar involvement on needle core biopsy was also predictive of the precise location of extraprostatic extension on final prostatectomy pathology (Chi-square p < .001, negative predictive value > 70% in all prostate sextants).  Conclusions:   These data suggest the use of biopsy polar core involvement as a valuable histologic predictor of increased pathologic stage.""","""['Patrick J Hensley', 'Lisa R Bailey', 'Matthew S Purdom', 'Daniel L Davenport', 'Stephen E Strup']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.', 'A solitary positive prostate cancer biopsy does not predict a unilateral lesion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Prediction of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer based on needle biopsy findings: perineural invasion lacks significance on multivariate analysis.', 'Correlation of the anatomo-pathological staging of radical prostatectomy specimens with the amount of cancer in the preoperative sextant biopsy.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.']"""

The emerging researches have proved that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is effective in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. We demonstrated that combination of AR antagonist (bicalutamide) and PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) could inhibit cell viability and induce cell apoptosis significantly whatever in vitro or in vivo setting in AR-positive TNBC. Previous studies have proved that both BRCA1 and PARP1 have close connections with AR in prostate cancer. We explored the correlation among AR, PARP1 and BRCA1 in TNBC for the first time. After BRCA1 overexpression, the expression of AR and PARP1 were decreased in mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, AR positively regulated PARP1 while PARP1 also up-regulated AR expression in vitro. We also confirmed BRCA1 expression was negatively correlated with AR and PARP1 in TNBC patients using a tissue microarray with TNBC patient samples.

Tumor volume and prostate-specific antigen were monitored, and tumors were harvested 7 days after treatment or at end of study for gene expression and immunohistochemical studies.Results: Three phenotypic groups were observed based on AA response. An ultraresponsive phenotype was identified in LuCaP 136CR with significant inhibition of tumor progression and increased survival, intermediate responders LuCaP 77CR and LuCaP 96CR with a modest tumor inhibition and survival benefit, and LuCaP 35CR with minimal tumor inhibition and no survival benefit upon AA treatment. We identified a molecular signature of secreted proteins associated with the AA ultraresponsive phenotype. Upon resistance, AA ultraresponder LuCaP 136CR displayed reduced androgen receptor (AR) signaling and sustainably low nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (nGR) localization, accompanied by steroid metabolism alteration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype enrichment with increased expression of NF-κB-regulated genes; intermediate and minimal responders maintained sustained AR signaling and increased tumoral nGR localization.Conclusions: We identified a molecular signature of secreted proteins associated with AA ultraresponsiveness and sustained AR/GR signaling upon AA resistance in intermediate or minimal responders. These data will inform development of noninvasive biomarkers predicting AA response and suggest that further inhibition along the AR/GR signaling axis may be effective only in AA-resistant patients who are intermediate or minimal responders.

Participants:   PCa survivors in Ireland where the Republic of Ireland (RoI) has a 50% higher PCa incidence than Northern Ireland (NI).  Method:   A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was sent to PCa survivors 2-18 years post-treatment, seeking information about current physical effects of treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EORTC QLQ-C30; EQ-5D-5L) and psychological well-being (21 question version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Outcomes in RoI and NI survivors were compared, stratifying into 'late disease' (stage III/IV and any Gleason grade (GG) at diagnosis) and 'early disease' (stage I/II and GG 2-7). Responses were weighted by age, jurisdiction and time since diagnosis. Between-country differences were investigated using multivariate logistic and linear regression.  Results:   3348 men responded (RoI n=2567; NI n=781; reflecting population sizes, response rate 54%). RoI responders were younger; less often had comorbidities (45% vs 38%); were more likely to present asymptomatically (66%; 41%) or with early disease (56%; 35%); and less often currently used androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; 2%; 28%). Current prevalence of incontinence (16%) and impotence (56% early disease, 67% late disease) did not differ between RoI and NI. In early disease, only current bowel problems (RoI 12%; NI 21%) differed significantly in multivariate analysis.

Patients and methods:   The non-synonymous or promoter-locating polymorphisms of antioxidant enzymes were examined as well as the time to CRPC progression and overall survival in 104 and 92 patients treated with ADT for metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer, respectively. In addition, intracellular reactive oxygen species and expression levels of antioxidant enzymes were examined in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells.  Results:   In metastatic prostate cancer, the AG/GG allele in GSTM3 rs7483 and CT/TT allele in CAT rs564250 were associated with a significantly lower risk of progression to CRPC and all-cause death compared with homozygotes of the major AA allele (hazard ratio [HR]; [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.55 [0.34-0.86], P = 0.0086) and CC allele (HR; [95% CI], 0.48 [0.24-0.88], P = 0.016), respectively.

Fine and Gray's competing risk model was used for estimation of the cumulative incidence of second tumors. Multivariable analysis was conducted using Cox regression.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 29 027 patients of which 15 467 patients had undergone RT. Median follow-up was 7.7 years (range 0-27). Among all 4398 patients who were diagnosed with a second primary tumor, 1030 had one or more pelvic tumors. The standardized incidence risk for any second tumor was 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.19), resulting in 27.7/10 000 excess cancer cases per year in patients treated for rectal cancer compared with the general population. RT reduced the cumulative incidence of second pelvic tumors compared with patients who did not receive RT (subhazard ratio [SHR] 0.77, CI 0.68-0.88). Second prostate tumors were less common in patients who received RT (SHR 0.54, CI 0.46-0.64), gynecological tumors were more frequently observed in patients who received RT (SHR 1.49, CI 1.11-2.00).  Conclusions:   Patients with previous rectal cancer had a marginally increased risk of a second tumor compared with the general population. Gynecological tumors occurred more often in females who received RT, but this did not result in an overall increased risk for a second cancer. RT even seemed to have a protective effect on the development of other second pelvic tumors, pre-dominantly for prostate cancer.

However, data are missing on populations of African descent. We evaluated the safety and benefit of active surveillance in an African Caribbean cohort with favorable risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Between 2005 and 2016, a single center, prospective cohort study was performed in Guadeloupe, French West Indies, including patients on active surveillance who had low risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less and Gleason score 6 or less) or favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml, Gleason score 3 + 4 or less and life expectancy less than 10 years). Treatment was recommended in case of grade progression, increased tumor volume, prostate cancer doubling time less than 36 months or patient wish. Overall survival, disease specific survival and duration of active surveillance were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify predictors of active surveillance termination.  Results:   A total of 234 patients with a median age of 64 years were enrolled in study. Median followup was 4 years (IQR 2.3-5.5). Overall survival at 30 months, 5 years and 10 years was 99.5%, 98.5% and 90.7%, respectively. Disease specific survival at 30 months, and 5 and 10 years was 100%. At 30 months, 5 years and 10 years 72.7%, 52.6% and 40.4% of patients, respectively, remained untreated and on active surveillance. Age (HR 0.96 per additional year, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and prostate specific antigen density (HR 1.52 per additional 0.1 ng/ml, 95% CI 1.20-1.89) were found to be independent predictors of active surveillance termination.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance is safe and beneficial for highly selected African Caribbean patients. It seems to be feasible for patients at low risk and intermediate favorable risk. Prostate specific antigen density could help better select these patients.""","""['Matthias E Meunier', 'Rémi Eyraud', 'Cédric Sénéchal', 'Gilles Gourtaud', 'Virginie Roux', 'Cécilia Lanchon', 'Laurent Brureau', 'Pascal Blanchet']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer is possible for Afro-Caribbean population: Comparison of oncological outcomes with a Caucasian cohort.', 'Role of prostate specific antigen and immediate confirmatory biopsy in predicting progression during active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer in Men Initially Treated with Active Surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active surveillance in favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer: outstanding questions and controversies.', 'Pathological upgrading and upstaging at radical prostatectomy in Jamaican men with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Defining and Measuring Adherence in Observational Studies Assessing Outcomes of Real-world Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Pattern of care of prostate cancer patients across the Martinique: results of a population-based study in the Caribbean.', 'Racial disparities and considerations for active surveillance of prostate cancer.']"""

To our knowledge it is unknown whether intermittent androgen deprivation therapy alters the risk of serious toxicities associated with continuous androgen deprivation therapy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a population based cohort study of 9,772 men 66 years old or older who were diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer from 2002 to 2011 and treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was defined as a single 90-day interval between 2 androgen deprivation therapy sessions during which patients visited their physicians or underwent prostate specific antigen testing. Outcomes included acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, type 2 diabetes and fracture. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the HRs of the comparative risk of serious toxicities between intermittent and continuous androgen deprivation therapy.  Results:   A total of 2,113 (22%), 769 (9%) and 899 men (9%) had a new cardiovascular event, diabetes or fracture, respectively, within 5 years of starting androgen deprivation therapy. Compared to the continuous androgen deprivation therapy group, the intermittent therapy group was at lower risk for serious cardiovascular events (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77), particularly in reducing the risk of heart failure (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.78) and fracture (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.70, each p <0.0001).  Conclusions:   Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was associated with a lower risk of heart failure and fracture compared to continuous androgen deprivation therapy. This raises toxicity concerns for continuous relative to intermittent therapy and suggests that intermittent androgen deprivation therapy may represent a safer therapeutic choice in elderly men with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Huei-Ting Tsai', 'Ruth M Pfeiffer', 'George K Philips', 'Ana Barac', 'Alex Z Fu', 'David F Penson', 'Yingjun Zhou', 'Arnold L Potosky']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The Role of Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate\xa0Cancer.', 'Ergänzung zur ADT bei frühem Prostatakarzinom verlängert Überleben.', 'Prostatakarzinom: weniger Komplikationen bei intermittierendem Androgenentzug.', 'Intermittent vs Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Risks of Major Long-Term Side Effects Associated with Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'The FinnProstate Study VII: intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Adverse Health Events Following Intermittent and Continuous Androgen Deprivation in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment of prostate cancer with intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation: a systematic review of randomized trials.', 'Addition of Metastasis-Directed Therapy to Intermittent Hormone Therapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The EXTEND Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Addressing Drug Resistance in Cancer: A Team Medicine Approach.', 'Rationale for Involved Field Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy-Enhanced Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Hormone-Sensitive Nodal Oligo-Recurrent Prostate Cancer Following Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Incidence of the adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a systematic literature review.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for bone oligometastatic disease in prostate cancer.']"""

Recent large multi-institutional data spanning the last decade have supported modification of risk of recurrence stratification based on grade groups: grade group 1 (3+3=6), grade group 2 (3+4=7), grade group 3 (4+3=7), grade group 4 (4+4=8), and grade group 5 (Gleason scores 9 and 10). Using currently accepted grading definitions of grade patterns and grading rules, this study examines how the introduction of a limited, less than 5%, Gleason pattern 5 component at prostatectomy affects prognosis and fits into the grade group schema and reporting. The aggregate data from 2 independent major academic medical centers comprising 7606 patient records were analyzed with respect to biochemical recurrence-free survival. The presence of a limited (tertiary) Gleason pattern 5 component in the context of Gleason scores 3+4=7 (grade group 2) and 4+3=7 (grade group 3) imparts an intermediate prognosis relative to the next highest grade group. As such, we suggest that an additional comment and designation to the grade groups be provided reflecting the increased risk of recurrence in such cases (such as grade group 2+ or 3+). In contrast, the presence of limited (<5%) Gleason pattern 5 in the context of Gleason score 4+4=8 imparts a poor prognosis equivalent to grade group 5 and therefore should be reported as grade group 5.""","""['Alexander S Baras', 'Joel B Nelson', 'Misop Han', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Presence of high grade tertiary Gleason pattern upgrades the Gleason sum score and is inversely associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Significance of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in Gleason score 7 radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern 5 is a powerful predictor of biochemical relapse in patients with Gleason score 7 prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Alternative prostate cancer grading systems incorporating percent pattern 4/5 (IQ-Gleason) and cribriform architecture (cGrade) improve prediction of outcome after radical prostatectomy.', 'Cribriform architecture outperforms Gleason pattern 4 percentage and tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in predicting the outcome of Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients.', 'Practice patterns related to prostate cancer grading: results of a 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society clinician survey.', 'The 2019 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Clinical outcome comparison of Grade Group 1 and Grade Group 2 prostate cancer with and without cribriform architecture at the time of radical prostatectomy.']"""

Stabilization of the nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) could be associated with these effects in the tumor cell line. An increase in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator-1α (PGC1α) level and a decrease in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) level would suggest a possible metabolic shift. The knockdown in the nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) attenuated the SFN-induced effect on prostate cancer cells demonstrating that mitochondrial biogenesis plays an important role in cell death for this kind of tumor cells.

Planning scans are usually performed after 2-3 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We examine the effect of ADT on choline tracer uptake and boost volumes identified on choline PET/CT.  Methods:   Fluoroethylcholine (18F choline) PET/CT was performed for dose painting radiotherapy planning in patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Initially, they were performed at planning. Owing to low visual tracer uptake, PET/CT for subsequent patients was performed at staging. We compared these two approaches on intraprostatic lesions obtained on PET using both visual and automatic threshold methods [prostate maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 60%] when compared with mpMRI.  Results:   PET/CT was performed during ADT in 11 patients (median duration of 85 days) and before ADT in 29 patients. ADT significantly reduced overall prostate volume by 17%. During ADT, prostate SUVmax was lower although it did not reach statistical significance (4.2 vs 6.6, p = 0.06); three patients had no visually identifiable PET DIL; and visually defined PET DILs were significantly smaller than corresponding mpMRI DILs (p = 0.03). However, all patients scanned before ADT had at least one visually identifiable PET DIL, with no significant size difference between MRI and visually defined PET DILs. In both groups, threshold PET produced larger DILs than visual PET. Both PET methods have moderate sensitivity (0.50-0.68) and high specificity (0.85-0.98) for identifying MRI-defined disease.  Conclusion:   For visual contouring of boost volumes in prostate dose painting radiotherapy, 18F choline PET/CT should be performed before ADT. For threshold contouring of boost volumes using our PET/CT scanning protocol, threshold levels of above 60% prostate SUVmax may be more suitable. Additional use of PET with MRI for radiotherapy planning can significantly change the overall boost volumes compared with using MRI alone. Advances in knowledge: For prostate dose painting radiotherapy, the additional use of 18F choline PET with MRI can significantly change the overall boost volumes, and PET should be performed before hormone therapy, especially if boost volumes are visually identified.""","""['Joachim Chan', 'Antony Carver', 'John N H Brunt', 'Sobhan Vinjamuri', 'Isabel Syndikus']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Intensity modulated radiation therapy dose painting for localized prostate cancer using ¹¹C-choline positron emission tomography scans.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Focal dose escalation for prostate cancer using 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT and MRI: a planning study based on histology reference.', 'PET/CT and radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Planning of External Beam Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Guided by PET/CT.', 'Molecular Imaging Assessment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Value of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in predicting response to radical radiotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Tab2 interacts also with steroid receptors and dismisses NCoR from antagonist-bound Estrogen and Androgen Receptors on gene regulatory regions, thus modifying their transcriptional activity and leading to pharmacological resistance in breast and prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated previously that either Tab2 knock-down, or a peptide mimicking the Estrogen Receptor alpha domain interacting with Tab2, restore the antiproliferative response to Tamoxifen in Tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. In this work, we map the domain of Tab2 responsible of Estrogen Receptor alpha interaction. First, using both co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down with recombinant proteins, we found that the central part of Tab2 is primarily responsible for this interaction, and that this region also interacts with Androgen Receptor. Then, we narrowed down the essential interaction region by means of competition assays using recombinant protein pull-down. The interaction motif was finally identified as a small region adjacent to, but not overlapping, the Tab2 MEKK1 phosphorylation sites. A synthetic peptide mimicking this motif efficiently displaced Tab2 from interacting with recombinant Estrogen Receptor alpha in vitro, prompting us to test its efficacy using derivatives of the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell lines that are spontaneously resistant to Tamoxifen. Indeed, we observed that this mimic peptide, made cell-permeable by addition of the TAT minimal carrier domain, reduced the growth of Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells in the presence of Tamoxifen. These data indicate a novel functional domain of the Tab2 protein with potential application in drug design.""","""['Stefania Reineri', 'Silvia Agati', 'Valentina Miano', 'Monica Sani', 'Paola Berchialla', 'Laura Ricci', 'Andrea Iannello', 'Lucia Coscujuela Tarrero', 'Santina Cutrupi', 'Michele De Bortoli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Targeting of the adaptor protein Tab2 as a novel approach to revert tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells.', 'Proteomic identification of Profilin1 as a corepressor of estrogen receptor alpha in MCF7 breast cancer cells.', 'Menin, a product of the MENI gene, binds to estrogen receptor to enhance its activity in breast cancer cells: possibility of a novel predictive factor for tamoxifen resistance.', 'Role of estrogen receptor alpha transcriptional coregulators in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor degradation: a CUE for endocrine resistance?', 'Circular RNA WHSC1 exerts oncogenic properties by regulating miR-7/TAB2 in lung cancer.', 'Associations between TAB2 Gene Polymorphisms and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer in a Chinese Population.', 'Black tea and D. candidum extracts play estrogenic activity via estrogen receptor α-dependent signaling pathway.']"""

Response rates have continued to fall over the past decade despite all efforts to increase participation. Many factors have been linked to reduced response, yet relatively few studies have employed multivariate approaches to identify characteristics that differentiate respondents from nonrespondents since it is hard to collect information on the latter. We aimed to assess factors contributing to enrollment of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. We combined data from the North Carolina-Louisiana (LA) PCa Project's LA cohort, with additional sources such as US census tract and LA tumor registry data. We included specific analyses focusing on blacks, a group often identified as hard to enroll in health-related research. The ability to study the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which occurred amidst enrollment, as a potential determinant of nonresponse makes our study unique. Older age (≥ 70) for blacks (OR 0.65) and study phase with respect to Hurricane Katrina for both races (OR 0.59 for blacks, OR 0.48 for whites) were significant predictors of participation with lower odds. Neighborhood poverty for whites (OR 1.53) also was a significant predictor of participation, but with higher odds. Among blacks, residence in Orleans parish was associated with lower odds of participation (OR 0.33) before Katrina. The opposite occurred in whites, with lower odds (OR 0.43) after Katrina. Our results overall underscore the importance of tailoring enrollment approaches to specific target population characteristics to confront the challenges posed by nonresponse. Our results also show that recruitment-related factors may change when outside forces bring major alterations to a population's environment and demographics.""","""['Evrim Oral', 'Neal Simonsen', 'Christine Brennan', 'Jennifer Berken', 'L Joseph Su', 'James L Mohler', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'Elizabeth T H Fontham']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hurricane Katrina deaths, Louisiana, 2005.', 'The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP): methods and design of a multidisciplinary population-based cohort study of racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Saturated fat intake and prostate cancer aggressiveness: results from the population-based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.', 'Prostate cancer aggressiveness and financial toxicity among prostate cancer patients.', 'Expectant management of localized prostate cancer.', 'The feasibility of web surveys for obtaining patient-reported outcomes from cancer survivors: a randomized experiment comparing survey modes and brochure enclosures.', 'Predictors of Response Outcomes for Research Recruitment Through a Central Cancer Registry: Evidence From 17 Recruitment Efforts for Population-Based Studies.', 'Modelling attrition and nonparticipation in a longitudinal study of prostate cancer.']"""

However, the utilization of fascinating characters of Mel NP such as innate MR contrast effects, high affinity to metal ions, strong light absorption requires special design with strategic synthetic method for its own purpose. Here, we have introduced paramagnetic Gd3+ metal ions and silica nanocoating on Mel NP for the dual-modal MRI/fluorescent contrast-enhanced imaging and therapeutics. The Gd3+ chelating kinetics of Mel NP by quinone and hydroquinone residues were optimized in various conditions of Gd3+ amounts and pH in solution for improving MRI contrast enhancing properties of the Mel NP. Then, bioinert silica was coated on the surfaces of Gd-chelated Mel NP (Gd-Mel@SiO2 NP) with a modified sol-gel process.

From a mechanical perspective, a more elegant approach is to rotate the patient within a stationary beam. Key obstacles to this approach are patient tolerance and anatomical deformation. Very little information on either aspect is available in the literature. The purpose of this work was therefore to design and test an MRI-compatible patient rotation system such that the feasibility of a patient rotation workflow could be tested.  Methods:   A patient rotation system (PRS) was designed to fit inside the bore of a 3T MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens) such that 3D images could be acquired at different rotation angles. Once constructed, a pelvic imaging study was carried out on a healthy volunteer. T2-weighted MRI images were taken every 45° between 0° and 360°, (with 0° equivalent to supine). The prostate, bladder, and rectum were segmented using atlas-based auto contouring. The images from each angle were registered back to the 0° image in three steps: (a) Rigid registration was based on MRI visible markers on the couch. (b) Rigid registration based on the prostate contour (equivalent to a rigid shift to the prostate). (c) Nonrigid registration. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean average surface distance (MASD) were calculated for each organ at each step.  Results:   The PRS met all design constraints and was successfully integrated with the MRI scanner. Phantom images showed minimal difference in signal or noise with or without the PRS in the MRI scanner. For the MRI images, the DSC (mean ± standard deviation) over all angles in the prostate, rectum, and bladder was 0.60 ± 0.11, 0.56 ± 0.15, and 0.76 ± 0.06 after rigid couch registration, 0.88 ± 0.03, 0.81 ± 0.08, and 0.86 ± 0.03 after rigid prostate guided registration, and 0.85 ± 0.03, 0.88 ± 0.02, 0.87 ± 0.02 after nonrigid registration.  Conclusions:   An MRI-compatible patient rotation system has been designed, constructed, and tested. A pelvic study was carried out on a healthy volunteer. Rigid registration based on the prostate contour yielded DSC overlap statistics in the prostate superior to interobserver contouring variability reported in the literature.""","""['Brendan Whelan', 'Gary P Liney', 'Jason A Dowling', 'Robba Rai', 'Lois Holloway', 'Leigh McGarvie', 'Ilana Feain', 'Michael Barton', 'Megan Berry', 'Rob Wilkins', 'Paul Keall']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Pelvic organ motion and dosimetric implications during horizontal patient rotation for prostate radiation therapy.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Anatomical deformation due to horizontal rotation: towards gantry-free radiation therapy.', 'Technical note: A method to synthesize magnetic resonance images in different patient rotation angles with deep learning for gantry-free radiotherapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Evaluating the Reproducibility of Mouse Anatomy under Rotation in a Custom Immobilization Device for Conformal FLASH Radiotherapy.', 'Analytical derivation of elasticity in breast phantoms for deformation tracking.']"""

Here we show that mice treated with anakinra, an antagonist of the interleukin (IL)-1β receptor (IL-1R), or harboring a targeted deletion of IL-1R are significantly less prone to develop bone tumors when inoculated in the arterial circulation with human prostate cancer (PCa) cells expressing IL-1β. Interestingly, human mesenchymal stem cells exposed in vitro to medium conditioned by IL-1β-expressing cancer cells responded by upregulating S100A4, a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and this effect was blocked by anakinra. Analogously, the stroma adjacent to skeletal metastases generated in mice by IL-1β-expressing cancer cells showed a dramatic increase in S100A4, COX-2 and the alteration of 30 tumor-related genes as measured by Nanostring analysis. These effects were not observed in the stroma associated with the rare and much smaller metastases generated by the same cells in IL-1R knockout animals, confirming that tumor-secreted IL-1β generates skeletal CAFs and conditions the surrounding bone microenvironment. In skeletal lesions from patients with metastatic PCa, histological and molecular analyses revealed that IL-1β is highly expressed in cancer cells in which the androgen receptor (AR) is not detected (AR-), whereas this cytokine is uniformly absent in the AR-positive (AR+) metastatic cells. The stroma conditioned by IL-1β-expressing cancer cells served as a supportive niche also for coexisting IL-1β-lacking cancer cells, which are otherwise unable to generate tumors after independently seeding the skeleton of mice. This niche is established very early following tumor seeding and hints to a role of IL-1β in promoting early colonization of PCa at the skeletal level.""","""['K Shahriari', 'F Shen', 'A Worrede-Mahdi', 'Q Liu', 'Y Gong', 'F U Garcia', 'A Fatatis']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Interleukin-1β promotes skeletal colonization and progression of metastatic prostate cancer cells with neuroendocrine features.', 'Identification of an IL-1-induced gene expression pattern in AR+ PCa cells that mimics the molecular phenotype of AR- PCa cells.', 'IL-1β induces p62/SQSTM1 and represses androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'IL-1β expression driven by androgen receptor absence or inactivation promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Non-coding RNAs and glioma: Focus on cancer stem cells.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.']"""

In this work, we propose a supervoxel-based segmentation method for prostate MR images.  Methods:   A supervoxel is a set of pixels that have similar intensities, locations, and textures in a 3D image volume. The prostate segmentation problem is considered as assigning a binary label to each supervoxel, which is either the prostate or background. A supervoxel-based energy function with data and smoothness terms is used to model the label. The data term estimates the likelihood of a supervoxel belonging to the prostate by using a supervoxel-based shape feature. The geometric relationship between two neighboring supervoxels is used to build the smoothness term. The 3D graph cut is used to minimize the energy function to get the labels of the supervoxels, which yields the prostate segmentation. A 3D active contour model is then used to get a smooth surface by using the output of the graph cut as an initialization. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on 30 in-house MR image data and PROMISE12 dataset.  Results:   The mean Dice similarity coefficients are 87.2 ± 2.3% and 88.2 ± 2.8% for our 30 in-house MR volumes and the PROMISE12 dataset, respectively. The proposed segmentation method yields a satisfactory result for prostate MR images.

When expressed in tumours, SNPH inhibits the speed and distance travelled by individual mitochondria, suppresses organelle dynamics, and blocks chemotaxis and metastasis, in vivo. Tumour progression in humans is associated with downregulation or loss of SNPH, which correlates with shortened patient survival, increased mitochondrial trafficking to the cortical cytoskeleton, greater membrane dynamics and heightened cell invasion.

In the presence of non-rigid anatomical changes, it is often not obvious which patient position is most suitable. Thus, dose-guided patient alignment is an interesting approach to use available in-room imaging data for up-to-date dose calculation, aimed at finding the position that yields the optimal dose distribution. This contribution presents the first implementation of dose-guided patient alignment as multi-criteria optimization problem. User-defined clinical objectives are employed for setting up a multi-objective problem. Using pre-calculated dose distributions at a limited number of patient shifts and dose interpolation, a continuous space of Pareto-efficient patient shifts becomes accessible. Pareto sliders facilitate interactive browsing of the possible shifts with real-time dose display to the user. Dose interpolation accuracy is validated and the potential of multi-objective dose-guided positioning demonstrated for three head and neck (H&N) and three prostate cancer patients. Dose-guided positioning is compared to replanning for all cases. A delineated replanning CT served as surrogate for in-room imaging data. Dose interpolation accuracy was high. Using a [Formula: see text] dose difference criterion, a median pass-rate of 95.7% for H&N and 99.6% for prostate cases was determined in a comparison to exact dose calculations. For all patients, dose-guided positioning allowed to find a clinically preferable dose distribution compared to bony anatomy based alignment. For all H&N cases, mean dose to the spared parotid glands was below [Formula: see text] (up to [Formula: see text] with bony alignment) and clinical target volume (CTV) [Formula: see text] above 99.1% (compared to 95.1%). For all prostate patients, CTV [Formula: see text] was above 98.9% (compared to 88.5%) and [Formula: see text] to the rectum below [Formula: see text] (compared to 56.1%).

Methods:   Consecutive non-trial mCRPC patients who received ≥1 dose of radium dichloride-223 at four academic and one community urology-specific cancer centers from May 2013 to June 2014 were retrospectively identified. Association of baseline and on-therapy clinical variables with number of radium doses received and clinical outcomes including overall survival were analyzed using chi-square statistics, cox proportional hazards, and Kaplan-Meier methods. Bone Scan Index (BSI) was derived from available bone scans using EXINI software.  Results:   One hundred and forty-five patients were included. Radium-223 was administered for six cycles in 74 patients (51%). One-year survival in this heavily pre-treated population was 64% (95%CI: 54-73%). In univariate and multivariate analysis, survival was highly associated with receiving all six doses of Radium-223. Receipt of six doses was associated with ECOG PS of 0-1, lower baseline PSA & pain level, no prior abiraterone/enzalutamide, <5 BSI value, and normal alkaline phosphatase. In patients who reported baseline pain (n = 72), pain declined in 51% after one dose and increased in 7%. PSA declined ≥50% in 16% (18/110). Alkaline phosphatase declined ≥25% in 48% (33/69) and ≥50% in 16/69 patients. BSI declined in 17 (68%) of the 25 patients who had bone scan available at treatment follow-up. Grade ≥3 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 4% (n = 114), 4% (n = 125), and 5% (n = 123), respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients earlier in their disease course with <5 BSI, low pain score, and good ECOG performance status are optimal candidates for radium-223.

WZ35, a chemical analog of curcumin, had been demonstrated to have high chemical stability and potential anticancer effects in gastric cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-prostate cancer effects of WZ35 in vitro and in vivo as well as the underlying mechanism.  Methods:   Two prostate cancer cell lines RM-1 and DU145 were utilized to test the anti-cancer effects of WZ35 and the underlying mechanism. MTT assay was used to assess the cytotoxic effect of WZ35. Cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, alteration of ROS, and [Ca2+ ]i level were evaluated using flow cytometry. Western blotting assay was applied to measure the levels of proteins associated with apoptosis and cell cycle. Immunofluorescence staining and Electron micrographs were used to evaluate activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Tumor models in nude mice were induced by injection of RM-1 prostate cancer cells to test the in vivo anticancer action of WZ35.  Results:   Our results showed that WZ35 treatment induced loss of cell viability, cell apoptosis, and G2/M cycle arrest in both RM-1 and DU145 cells, coupled with ROS overproduction, intracellular calcium surge, and activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in RM-1 cells. Interestingly, all above changes induced by WZ35 were completely reversed by ROS blockage. In addition, prevention of [Ca2+ ]i elevation by BAPTA/AM also inhibited activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway induced by WZ35. In vivo studies, WZ35 treatment significantly inhibited RM-1 homograft tumor growth along with increased ROS accumulation, mitochondrial disruption, and cell apoptosis in tumor tissues.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, this work provides a novel anticancer candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer and demonstrated that increased ROS mediate the anti-cancer effects of WZ35 via activating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Importantly, this work also reveals that targeting ROS generation might be an effective strategy in human androgen-resistant prostate cancer treatment.

Results:   There were 1,964 (27.0%) normal weight, 3,826 (52.6%) overweight, 1,200 (16.5%) obese, and 285 (3.9%) moderately + severely obese patients. With increasing BMI, there was a progressive decrease in PSA (P = 0.02), increase in prostate volume (P < 0.001), and decrease in both testosterone (P < 0.001) and DHT (P < 0.001). Using linear regression, increasing BMI was associated with decreasing serum PSA values. Furthermore, BMI remained inversely associated with PSA after individually adjusting for testosterone and DHT, as well as when adjusting for testosterone and DHT in the same model. Decreased androgen levels accounted for only 19% of the lower PSA in men with higher BMI.  Conclusions:   Only a fraction of lower PSA in obese men could be attributed to testosterone and DHT levels. The remaining factors explaining lower PSA are unaccounted for, presumably secondary to hemodilution associated with increased plasma volume in obese men.

Methods:   Five miRNAs that have been consistently found deregulated in PCa (miR-21, miR-141, miR-214, miR-375, and let-7c) were analyzed in urinary pellets from 60 prostate cancer (PCa) patients and 10 healthy subjects by qRT-PCR. Besides, urinary exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed for those miRNAs.  Results:   Significant upregulation of miR-21, miR-141, and miR-375 was found comparing PCa patients with healthy subjects in urinary pellets, while miR-214 was found significantly downregulated. Regarding urinary exosomes, miR-21 and miR-375 were also significantly upregulated in PCa but no differences were found for miR-141. Significant differences were found for let-7c in PCa in urinary exosomes while no differences were observed in urinary pellets. A panel combining miR-21 and miR-375 is suggested as the best combination to distinguish PCa patients and healthy subjects, with an AUC of 0.872. Furthermore, the association of miRNAs with clinicopathological characteristics was investigated. MiR-141 resulted significantly correlated with Gleason score in urinary pellets and let-7c with clinical stage in urinary exosomes. Additionally, miR-21, miR-141, and miR-214 were found significantly deregulated in intermediate/high-risk PCa versus low-risk/healthy subjects in urinary pellets. Significant differences between both groups were found in urinary exosomes for miR-21, miR-375, and let-7c.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that the analysis of miRNAs-especially miRNA-21 and miR-375- in urine could be useful as biomarkers in PCa.

Hence, we assessed perioperative, oncological and functional outcomes, and complications of RARP in patients with previous abdominal surgery after 1-year minimum follow-up.  Materials and methods:   Prospectively collected data from 339 consecutive patients undergoing transperitoneal RARP by a single surgeon (AM) between November 2008 and May 2014 were analysed. Complications were classified according to Modified Clavien System. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as two consecutive PSA values ≥ 0.2 ng/ml. Functional outcomes were assessed using validated, self-administered questionnaires. In particular, only patients undergoing nerve-sparing RARP with no erectile dysfunction (baseline IIEF-5 score >21) and no use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors preoperatively who were interested in erections and required no adjuvant therapy (radiation, orchiectomy and androgen-deprivation therapy) were evaluated concerning potency recovery. Patients without and with previous abdominal surgery were compared using Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests (or Fisher exact test).  Results:   On 339 patients, 247 (71.6%) had not undergone previous abdominal surgery (Group 1) and 92 (28.4%) were pre-operated (Group 2). There were no statistically significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 regarding mean operative time (260 vs. 257 min; p = 0.597), median number of resected nodes (16 vs. 17; p = 0.484), mean length of stay (7.2 vs. 7.1 d; p = 0.151), positive surgical margin (12.5% vs. 16.3%; p = 0.233) and complication rates (26.7% vs. 31.5%; p = 0.187). Median (IQR) follow-up was 36 (12-48) months. For Groups 1 and 2, BCR-free survival rates were 78.5% and 79.8% (p = 0.467); continence rates were 97.9% and 100% (p = 0.329), whereas a potency recovery was achieved in 69.5% and 62.2% of patients (p = 0.460), respectively.

Objective:   To directly assess whether germline mutations in these three genes distinguish lethal from indolent PCa and whether they confer any effect on age at death.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective case-case study of 313 patients who died of PCa and 486 patients with low-risk localized PCa of European, African, and Chinese descent. Germline DNA of each of the 799 patients was sequenced for these three genes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Mutation carrier rates and their effect on lethal PCa were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and Cox regression analysis, respectively.  Results and limitations:   The combined BRCA1/2 and ATM mutation carrier rate was significantly higher in lethal PCa patients (6.07%) than localized PCa patients (1.44%), p=0.0007. The rate also differed significantly among lethal PCa patients as a function of age at death (10.00%, 9.08%, 8.33%, 4.94%, and 2.97% in patients who died ≤ 60 yr, 61-65 yr, 66-70 yr, 71-75 yr, and over 75 yr, respectively, p=0.046) and time to death after diagnosis (12.26%, 4.76%, and 0.98% in patients who died ≤ 5 yr, 6-10 yr, and>10 yr after a PCa diagnosis, respectively, p=0.0006). Survival analysis in the entire cohort revealed mutation carriers remained an independent predictor of lethal PCa after adjusting for race and age, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score at the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio=2.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.24-3.66, p=0.004). A limitation of this study is that other DNA repair genes were not analyzed.  Conclusions:   Mutation status of BRCA1/2 and ATM distinguishes risk for lethal and indolent PCa and is associated with earlier age at death and shorter survival time.

Methods:   Under an RDRC-approved research protocol, we evaluated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 68Ga PSMA-11 with serial PET imaging following intravenous administration to nine prostate cancer patients in whom clinical [11C]acetate PET/CT exams had been independently performed under Expanded Access IND 118,204. List-mode imaging was performed over the initial 0-10min post-injection with the pelvis in the field-of-view. Whole-body images were acquired, pelvis-to-head, at 15, 60, and 90-min post-injection. Additional images of the pelvis were acquired at 40-min and 115-min, and voided urine collected from each subject at 48-min and 120-min post-injection. Radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated from these data using the OLINDA software package.  Results:   Renal uptake was high and relatively invariant, ranging from 11% to 14% of the injected dose between 15 and 90-min post-injection. Radioactivity collected in the voided urine accounted for 14% of the injected dose over a period of 120-min. Lymph nodes and skeletal metastases suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence were detected in a greater number of patients using 68Ga PSMA-11 than using 11C-acetate.  Conclusion:   Kidneys are the critical organ following 68Ga PSMA-11 administration, receiving an estimated dose of 0.413mGy/MBq.  Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care:   This study confirms that the kidneys will be the critical organ following intravenous administration of 68Ga PSMA-11, and provided data consistent with the expectation that 68Ga PSMA-11 will be superior to [11C]acetate for defining sites of recurrence in prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical relapse.""","""['Mark A Green', 'Jacob A Eitel', 'James W Fletcher', 'Carla J Mathias', 'Mark A Tann', 'Thomas Gardner', 'Michael O Koch', 'Wendy Territo', 'Heather Polson', 'Gary D Hutchins']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['68GaGa-P16-093 as a PSMA-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceutical for Detection of Cancer: Initial Evaluation and Comparison with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting with Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED CC-a PSMA specific probe for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC) and preliminary evaluation of optimal imaging timing.', 'Performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Management at Initial Staging and Time of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'Predicting the effect of different folate doses on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', '68Ga-DOTA-DiPSMA PET/CT Imaging: Biodistribution, Dosimetry, and Preliminary Application in Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of an Albumin-Based PSMA Probe With Prolonged Half-Life.', 'Radiation dosimetry of 68GaPSMA-11 in low-risk prostate cancer patients.']"""

The staining intensity was analyzed in association with clinical pathological parameters such as Gleason score, pathological grade, clinical stage, tumor invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis. Furthermore, we repeated such analysis and investigated the prognostic value of Ect2 using the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Dataset. Our immunohistochemical results showed that the expression levels of Ect2 protein were enhanced in human prostate cancer tissues. There existed positive correlations between the expression levels of Ect2 and several clinicopathological parameters, including advanced clinical stage, enhanced tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. Similarly, we found that the expression levels of Ect2 were positively related to Gleason score, tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and high distant metastasis in the TCGA Dataset. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that lower levels of Ect2 mRNA predicted higher overall survivals and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survivals in all patients or non-metastatic patients. Multivariate analysis by Cox regression showed that the expression of Ect2 could be an independent prognostic marker of poor BCR-free survivals.

However, serum CGA was not tested for correlation with the most significant study end-point of long-term disease-specific survival (DSS). CGA and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) levels were measured by the BRAHMS KRYPTOR in two independent patient groups with 127 serum and 110 plasma samples. CGA and MMP7 concentrations were correlated with clinicopathological and survival data. In addition, we tested the combinations of CGA with PSA and with a currently identified prognostic factor, MMP7, for their prognostic value. CGA concentrations were significantly elevated in advanced compared to clinically localized cases both in serum and plasma samples (45 vs. 23 ng/ml, p < 0.001 and; 41 vs. 22 ng/ml; p = 0.002 respectively). In accordance, high CGA levels were correlated with poor DSS. In clinically localized cases, CGA levels alone were not prognostic, but its dichotomized combinations with PSA or MMP7 were independently associated with DSS (HR: 4.88, 95% CI: 1.35-17.71, p = 0.016, HR: 7.46, 1.65-33.63, p = 0.009, respectively). Elevated serum CGA levels in progressed PCA and its prognostic value suggest a potential for CGA in disease monitoring.

Methods:   A total of 121 consecutive patients underwent RC with curative intent between 2013 and 2014. HRQOL was prospectively assessed preoperatively, after 3 and 12 months, using the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The impact of complex perioperative treatment courses including cases requiring surgical re-interventions was retrospectively assessed using Martin criteria and the Clavien-Dindo scale. Urinary continence was determined using the validated ICIQ-SF questionnaire. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Spearman's rank correlation, and ordinal regression models (p < 0.05).  Results:   A total of 100 patients underwent further analysis. Physical functioning (PF), role functioning (RF), and global health status (GHS) scores were higher in the ONB subgroup both preoperatively (p < 0.001, 0.010, 0.048) and 3 months after RC (p = 0.003, 0.048, 0.019). Clavien complications ≥III led to reduced PF levels after 3 months (p = 0.050) without effect on GHS (p = 0.825). Operating time and length of critical care monitoring correlated with 3 months pain scores in the ONB subgroup (p = 0.003, 0.009) without affecting GHS (p = 0.603, 0.653). Continent urinary diversion was an independent predictor of increased HRQOL after 3 months (p = 0.021), however, not after 12 months (p = 0.803).  Conclusions:   Patients receiving an IC have lower PF, RF, and GHS scores than those receiving ONB. Perioperative complications and complicated treatment courses can affect HRQOL subdomains but do not significantly impact the GHS.

Herein, it is demonstrated that miR-194 is a driver of prostate cancer metastasis. Prostate tissue levels of miR-194 were associated with disease aggressiveness and poor outcome. Ectopic delivery of miR-194 stimulated migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cell lines, and stable overexpression of miR-194 enhanced metastasis of intravenous and intraprostatic tumor xenografts. Conversely, inhibition of miR-194 activity suppressed the invasive capacity of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo Mechanistic investigations identified the ubiquitin ligase suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) as a direct, biologically relevant target of miR-194 in prostate cancer. Low levels of SOCS2 correlated strongly with disease recurrence and metastasis in clinical specimens. SOCS2 downregulation recapitulated miR-194-driven metastatic phenotypes, whereas overexpression of a nontargetable SOCS2 reduced miR-194-stimulated invasion. Targeting of SOCS2 by miR-194 resulted in derepression of the oncogenic kinases FLT3 and JAK2, leading to enhanced ERK and STAT3 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of ERK and JAK/STAT pathways reversed miR-194-driven phenotypes. The GATA2 transcription factor was identified as an upstream regulator of miR-194, consistent with a strong concordance between GATA2 and miR-194 levels in clinical specimens. Overall, these results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of metastatic progression in prostate cancer.

Therefore, clarification of the mechanisms of hormone-related tumor progression and resistance to anti-androgen drugs is useful in order to develop strategies for appropriate treatment of CRPC. Galectin-3 has been shown to be correlated with tumor progression in a variety of cancer types through the regulation of tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.  Materials and methods:   We examined tumor cell invasion and migration using the xCELLigence system. Control LNCaP and galectin-3-expressing LNCaP (LNCaP-Gal-3) cells were cultured with androgen-depleted medium with 5% charcoal-stripped serum. Cells were treated for 24 h with or without dihydrotestosterone alone or combined with MDV3100 and bicalutamide; gene profile was then analyzed by microarray analysis and mRNA expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated tumor growth using spheroids and xenograft tumor growth in a mouse model.  Results:   In vitro, LNCaP-Gal-3 cells promoted both cell migration and invasion in an androgen-independent manner compared to control LNCaP cells. Galectin-3 also enhanced anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor growth even after castration. Importantly, galectin-3 greatly enhanced transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR), especially on treatment with dihydrotestosterone. In microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, galectin-3 increased the expression of several AR-target genes, such as kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). These AR-target genes were not fully suppressed by anti-androgen drugs such as bicalutamide or MDV3100. Galectin-3 significantly inhibited the effect induced by anti-androgen drugs MDV3100 and bicalutamide, suggesting that galectin-3 may be involved in resistance to anti-androgen drug through enhancement of transcriptional activity of AR and expression of AR-related genes.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that galectin-3 is a potential target molecule for future treatment of anti-androgen drug-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Tsogt-Ochir Dondoo', 'Tomoharu Fukumori', 'Kei Daizumoto', 'Tomoya Fukawa', 'Miho Kohzuki', 'Minoru Kowada', 'Yoshito Kusuhara', 'Hidehisa Mori', 'Hiroyoshi Nakatsuji', 'Masayuki Takahashi', 'Hiro-Omi Kanayama']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Development and exploitation of a novel mutant androgen receptor modelling strategy to identify new targets for advanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'Natural killer cells suppress enzalutamide resistance and cell invasion in the castration resistant prostate cancer via targeting the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7).', 'ASC-J9(®) suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer progression via degrading the enzalutamide-induced androgen receptor mutant AR-F876L.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'A Novel Signature Based on Anoikis Associated with BCR-Free Survival for Prostate Cancer.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?']"""

Using CR, we have established matched normal and tumor cultures, GUMC-29 and GUMC-30 respectively, from a patient's prostatectomy specimen. These CR cells proliferate indefinitely in vitro and retain stable karyotypes. Most importantly, only tumor-derived CR cells (GUMC-30) produced tumors in xenografted SCID mice, demonstrating maintenance of the critical tumor phenotype. Characterization of cells with DNA fingerprinting demonstrated identical patterns in normal and tumor CR cells as well as in xenografted tumors. By flow cytometry, both normal and tumor CR cells expressed basal, luminal, and stem cell markers, with the majority of the normal and tumor CR cells expressing prostate basal cell markers, CD44 and Trop2, as well as luminal marker, CD13, suggesting a transit-amplifying phenotype. Consistent with this phenotype, real time RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CR cells predominantly expressed high levels of basal cell markers (KRT5, KRT14 and p63), and low levels of luminal markers. When the CR tumor cells were injected into SCID mice, the expression of luminal markers (AR, NKX3.1) increased significantly, while basal cell markers dramatically decreased. These data suggest that CR cells maintain high levels of proliferation and low levels of differentiation in the presence of feeder cells and ROCK inhibitor, but undergo differentiation once injected into SCID mice.

To date, the biological significance of exosomal secretion of maspin is unknown. The current study aims at addressing whether maspin is spontaneously secreted as an exosomal protein to regulate tumor/stromal interactions. We prepared exosomes along with cell extracts and vesicle-depleted conditioned media (VDCM) from normal epithelial (CRL2221, MCF-10A and BEAS-2B) and cancer (LNCaP, PC3 and SUM149) cell lines. Atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis revealed similar size distribution patterns and surface zeta potentials between the normal cells-derived and tumor cells-derived exosomes. Electron microscopy revealed that maspin was encapsulated by the exosomal membrane as a cargo protein. While western blotting revealed that the level of exosomal maspin from tumor cell lines was disproportionally lower relative to the levels of corresponding intracellular and VDCM maspin, as compared to that from normal cell lines, maspin knockdown in MCF-10A cells led to maspin-devoid exosomes, which exhibited significantly reduced suppressive effects on the chemotaxis activity of recipient NIH3T3 fibroblast cells.

Here, we performed a combined isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis to compare protein profiles using pooled serum and EPS-urine samples from 4 groups of patients: benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), localized PCa and metastatic PCa. The differentially expressed proteins were rigorously selected and further validated in a large and independent cohort using classical ELISA and Western blot assays. Finally, we established a multiplex biomarker panel consisting of 3 proteins (serum PF4V1, PSA, and urinary CRISP3) with an excellent diagnostic capacity to differentiate PCa from BPH [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.941], which showed an evidently greater discriminatory ability than PSA alone (AUC, 0.757) (P<0.001). Importantly, even when PSA level was in the gray zone (4-10 ng/mL), a combination of PF4V1 and CRISP3 could achieve a relatively high diagnostic efficacy (AUC, 0.895). Furthermore, their combination also had the potential to distinguish PCa from HGPIN (AUC, 0.934).

The significance of AIP has not been formally established. We compared the clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of AIP with classic IDC in 310 radical prostatectomy specimens that were received over an 18-month period.

The degree of uniform phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss in 34 selected cases was identical in AIP and IDC (66.7%). No foci of HGPIN showed uniform PTEN loss; there was only 38% concordance of PTEN expression pattern between HGPIN and the nearby acinar carcinoma, unlike AIP and IDC (77% and 81%, respectively, P<0.01).

The accurate proportion and dynamics of CTC clusters remain unclear due to the fact that CTCs in blood flow are very difficult to detect in vivo and in vitro. CTC clusters are even more difficult to be distinguished from CTCs without perturbation by state-of-the-art detection methods. Here, we demonstrate that by using in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC), we can reliably measure the proportion and dynamics of CTC clusters in two murine tumor models. CTC clusters are easily identified by their unique fluorescent pattern with multiple peaks and wider time duration. We find that the proportion of CTC clusters increases significantly during cancer metastasis in both mouse models, the orthotopic liver cancer and the subcutaneous prostate cancer models. Our results suggest that CTC clusters account for a much larger proportion of CTCs than previously anticipated. Hence this report might provide a new-level of understanding of CTCs during cancer development and progression. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.""","""['Yuanzhen Suo', 'Chengying Xie', 'Xi Zhu', 'Zhichao Fan', 'Zhangru Yang', 'Hao He', 'Xunbin Wei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cytometry A""","""['A Noninvasive and Real-Time Method for Circulating Tumor Cell Detection by In Vivo Flow Cytometry.', 'Real-time monitoring of rare circulating hepatocellular carcinoma cells in an orthotopic model by in vivo flow cytometry assesses resection on metastasis.', 'Color-coded Imaging of the Circulating Tumor Cell Microenvironment.', 'CTC clusters in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Relevance of CTC Clusters in Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.', 'Constructing an In Vitro and In Vivo Flow Cytometry by Fast Line Scanning of Confocal Microscopy.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Ready for Prime Time?', 'A narrative review of circulating tumor cells clusters: A key morphology of cancer cells in circulation promote hematogenous metastasis.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as an Indicator of Treatment Options for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Less Than or Equal to 3\u2005cm in Size: A Multi-Center, Retrospective Study.']"""

The object of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options in the treatment of advanced hormone-naive prostate cancer in China.  Methods:   A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was carried out from the Chinese societal perspective. The efficacy data were obtained from the STAMPEDE trial and health utilities were derived from previous studies. Transition probabilities were calculated based on the survival in each group. The primary endpoint in the analysis was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and model uncertainties were explored by 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.  Results:   SOC alone generated an effectiveness of 2.65 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a lifetime cost of $20,969.23. At a cost of $25,001.34, SOC plus zoledronic acid was associated with 2.69 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $100,802.75/QALY compared with SOC alone.

A combination of photon intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on pelvis with a carbon ion boost might be the optimal treatment scheme to escalate the dose on prostate and deliver curative dose with respect to normal tissue and quality of dose distributions. In fact, carbon ion beams offer the advantage to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) using a significantly smaller number of fractions compared to conventional RT without increasing risks of late effects.  Methods:   This study is a prospective phase II clinical trial exploring safety and feasibility of a mixed beam scheme of carbon ion prostate boost followed by photon IMRT on pelvis. The study is designed to enroll 65 patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer at 3 different oncologic hospitals: Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, and Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica. The primary endpoint is the evaluation of safety and feasibility with acute toxicity scored up to 1 month after the end of RT. Secondary endpoints are treatment early (3 months after the end of RT) and long-term tolerability, quality of life, and efficacy.  Results:   The study is not yet recruiting; in silico studies are ongoing and we expect to start recruitment by 2017.  Conclusions:   The present clinical trial aims at improving the current treatment for high-risk prostate cancer, evaluating safety and feasibility of a new RT mixed-beam scheme including photons and carbon ions. Encouraging results are coming from carbon ion facilities worldwide on the treatment of different tumors including prostate cancers. Carbon ions combine physical properties allowing for high dose conformity and advantageous radiobiological characteristics.

This is reducing the number of conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (LR P) and laparoscopic ePLNDs for prostate cancer in Europe. Aim of this study is to compare laparoscopic ePLND to robotic-assisted ePLND in a cohort of patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   We performed a matched-pair analysis matching 1:1 70 patients who underwent LRP+ePLND (2004-2009) to 70 who underwent RAR P+ePLND (2010-2014). All patients presented with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer according to D'Amico classification. Patients were retrospectively analyzed. Differences in pathologic characteristics and postoperative complications across the two groups were assessed using Wilcoxon Rank sum or χ2 Test.  Results:   LRP was associated with shorter OR times and decreased blood loss (P<0.001). However, in the robotic-assisted arm, more lymph nodes were retrieved (18 vs. 12; P<001). No significant difference in positive surgical margins was found across the two techniques (P=0.9). Lymphocele formation and prolonged lymphorrea were specifically addressed as complications, with no significant difference emerging from our analyses (P>0.74).  Conclusions:   In this matched-pair analysis comparing patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer, a robotic-assisted approach was associated to a higher lymph node yield compared to conventional laparoscopy. However, this increase in node yield was balanced with longer OR times, increased blood loss, similar postoperative complications and similar oncologic outcomes.

Methods:   Twenty two patients with local recurrence of Pca after radical prostatectomy underwent HIFU as first-line salvage therapy. Considering that in all HIFU experiences, PSA nadir and PSA failure are different and PSA definition of BFSR is unknown, we defined treatment success as a PSA nadir ≤0.4 ng/mL 3 months after treatment. All early and late medical and surgical complications were recorded.  Results:   Ten of the 22 patients (45.5%) were classified as ""success"" three months after HIFU, showing a nadir PSA≤0.4 ng/mL; 12/22 patients (54.5%) were classified as ""failure"" during follow-up (median follow-up: 48 months).

Method: Here, we examined the effect of exenatide and liraglutide, 2 types of GLP-1 analogues, on prostate cancer cells growth by CCK-8 assay, Hoechst33258 staining assay, and western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2. Also the kinase pathways maybe involved and the expression of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 R) in LNCap cells was detected. Results: In our experiments, exenatide and liraglutide significantly inhibited the proliferation of the LNCap cell lines and induced the cell apoptosis. Exenatide (1-100 nmol/L) increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas liraglutide increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio only at concentrations of 10 nmol/L. And we found that GLP-1 analogues activate p38 but not ERK1/2 or AKT in LNCap cells. And classical GLP-1 receptor was detected in LNCap cells.

Activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling occurs in a wide variety of malignancies, including PCa. RNA-Seq of castration resistant PCa revealed expression of multiple FGFR signaling components compatible with FGFR signaling in all cases, with multiple FGF ligands expressed in 90% of cases. Immunohistochemistry confirmed FGFR signaling in the majority of xenografts and advanced PCas. AZD5363, an AKT kinase inhibitor and AZD4547, a FGFR kinase inhibitor are under active clinical development. We therefore sought to determine if these two drugs have additive effects in PCa models. The effect of both agents, singly and in combination was evaluated in a variety of PCa cell lines in vitro and in vivo. All cell lines tested responded to both drugs with decreased invasion, soft agar colony formation and growth in vivo, with additive effects seen with combination treatment. Activation of the FGFR, AKT, ERK and STAT3 pathways was examined in treated cells. AZD5363 inhibited AKT signaling and increased FGFR1 signaling, which partially compensated for decreased AKT kinase activity. While AZD4547 could effectively block the ERK pathway, combination treatment was needed to completely block STAT3 activation. Thus combination treatment with AKT and FGFR kinase inhibitors have additive effects on malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting multiple signaling pathways and mitigating the compensatory upregulation of FGFR signaling induced by AKT kinase inhibition.

Given the lack of evidence from general practice, we examined the association of salvage androgen deprivation therapy with mortality in an observational cohort study.  Materials and methods:   From 3 managed care organizations we assembled a retrospective cohort of all 5,804 men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer from 1995 to 2009 who had a prostate specific antigen increase (biochemical recurrence) after primary radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The main outcomes were all-cause and prostate cancer specific mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate mortality with salvage androgen deprivation therapy as a time dependent predictor.  Results:   Overall salvage androgen deprivation therapy was not associated with all-cause or prostate cancer specific mortality in the prostatectomy cohort (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70-1.35 or HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.68-2.07) or in the radiotherapy cohort (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.01 or HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80-1.40, respectively). Among men with prostate specific antigen doubling time less than 9 months after the prostate specific antigen rise, salvage androgen deprivation therapy was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk of all-cause and prostate cancer specific mortality in the prostatectomy cohort (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.63 and HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.91) and in the radiotherapy cohort (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48-0.80 and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90, respectively).

We compared this treatment with the standard of care, active surveillance, in men with low-risk prostate cancer in a phase 3 trial.  Methods:   This randomised controlled trial was done in 47 European university centres and community hospitals. Men with low-risk, localised prostate cancer (Gleason pattern 3) who had received no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (4 mg/kg padeliporfin intravenously over 10 min and optical fibres inserted into the prostate to cover the desired treatment zone and subsequent activation by laser light 753 nm with a fixed power of 150 mW/cm for 22 min 15 s) or active surveillance. Randomisation was done by a web-based allocation system stratified by centre with balanced blocks of two or four patients. Best practice for active surveillance at the time of study design was followed (ie, biopsy at 12-month intervals and prostate-specific antigen measurement and digital rectal examination at 3-month intervals). The co-primary endpoints were treatment failure (histological progression of cancer from low to moderate or high risk or death during 24 months' follow-up) and absence of definite cancer (absence of any histology result definitely positive for cancer at month 24). Analysis was by intention to treat. Treatment was open-label, but investigators assessing primary efficacy outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01310894.  Findings:   Between March 8, 2011, and April 30, 2013, we randomly assigned 206 patients to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy and 207 patients to active surveillance. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 24-25). The proportion of participants who had disease progression at month 24 was 58 (28%) of 206 in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group compared with 120 (58%) of 207 in the active surveillance group (adjusted hazard ratio 0·34, 95% CI 0·24-0·46; p<0·0001). 101 (49%) men in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group had a negative prostate biopsy result at 24 months post treatment compared with 28 (14%) men in the active surveillance group (adjusted risk ratio 3·67, 95% CI 2·53-5·33; p<0·0001). Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy was well tolerated. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were prostatitis (three [2%] in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group vs one [<1%] in the active surveillance group), acute urinary retention (three [2%] vs one [<1%]) and erectile dysfunction (two [1%] vs three [1%]). The most common serious adverse event in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group was retention of urine (15 patients; severe in three); this event resolved within 2 months in all patients. The most common serious adverse event in the active surveillance group was myocardial infarction (three patients).  Interpretation:   Padeliporfin vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy is a safe, effective treatment for low-risk, localised prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer survivors (n = 817) diagnosed between 1997 and 2000 were recruited between 2000 and 2002 into a prospective repeated measurements study. Behavioural/prognostic data were collected through in-person interviews and questionnaires. HRQoL was collected at three post-diagnosis time-points, approximately 2 years apart using the Short Form (SF)-36 validated questionnaire. To identify physical and mental HRQoL trajectories, group-based trajectory modelling was undertaken. Differences between groups were evaluated by assessing influential dropouts (mortality/poor health), behavioural/prognostic factors at diagnosis or during the follow-up. Three trajectories of physical HRQoL were identified including: average-maintaining HRQoL (32.2%), low-declining HRQoL (40.5%) and very low-maintaining HRQoL (27.3%). In addition, three trajectories for mental HRQoL were identified: average-increasing HRQoL (66.5%), above average-declining HRQoL (19.7%) and low-increasing HRQoL (13.8%). In both physical and mental HRQoL, dropout from mortality/poor health differed between trajectories, thus confirming HRQoL and mortality were related. Furthermore, increased Charlson comorbidity index score was consistently associated with physical and mental HRQoL group membership relative to average maintaining groups, while behaviours such as time-varying physical activity was associated with physical HRQoL trajectories but not mental HRQoL trajectories. It was possible to define three trajectories of physical and mental HRQoL after prostate cancer.

Methods:   Functional effects of ALPL inhibition were investigated in metastatic PCa cell lines. ALPL gene expression was analysed from published PCa data sets, and correlated with disease-free survival and metastasis.  Results:   ALPL expression was increased in PCa cells from metastatic sites. A reduction in tumour-derived ALPL expression or ALP activity increased cell death, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and reduced migration. Alkaline phosphatase activity was decreased by the EMT repressor Snail. In men with PCa, tumour-derived ALPL correlated with EMT markers, and high ALPL expression was associated with a significant reduction in disease-free survival.  Conclusions:   Our studies reveal the function of tumour-derived ALPL in regulating cell death and epithelial plasticity, and demonstrate a strong association between ALPL expression in PCa cells and metastasis or disease-free survival, thus identifying tumour-derived ALPL as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of PCa progression.""","""['S R Rao', 'A E Snaith', 'D Marino', 'X Cheng', 'S T Lwin', 'I R Orriss', 'F C Hamdy', 'C M Edwards']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'DNMT1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stem Cells, Which Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'MiR-573 inhibits prostate cancer metastasis by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing factor TWIST is an attractive target in advanced and/or metastatic bladder and prostate cancers.', 'ALPL-1 is a target for chimeric antigen receptor therapy in osteosarcoma.', 'Current status of N-, O-, S-heterocycles as potential alkaline phosphatase inhibitors: a medicinal chemistry overview.', 'Enzyme-Responsive Zr-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks for Controlled Drug Delivery: Taking Advantage of Clickable PEG-Phosphate Ligands.', 'Alkaline phosphatase combines with CT factors for differentiating small (≤\u20094\xa0cm) fat-poor angiomyolipoma from renal cell carcinoma: a multiple quantitative tool.', 'A practical dynamic nomogram model for predicting bone metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer.']"""

Due to its heterogeneity, the identification of key functional components involved in the regulation and progression of prostate cancer is a methodological challenge. In this study, we identified key regulatory interactions responsible for primary to metastasis transitions in prostate cancer using network inference approaches by integrating patient derived transcriptomic and miRomics data into gene/miRNA/transcription factor regulatory networks. One such network was derived for each of the clinical states of prostate cancer based on differentially expressed and significantly correlated gene, miRNA and TF pairs from the patient data. We identified key elements of each network using a network analysis approach and validated our results using patient survival analysis. We observed that HOXD10, BCL2 and PGR are the most important factors affected in primary prostate samples, whereas, in the metastatic state, STAT3, JUN and JUNB are playing a central role. Benefiting integrative networks our analysis suggests that some of these molecules were targeted by several overexpressed miRNAs which may have a major effect on the dysregulation of these molecules. For example, in the metastatic tumors five miRNAs (miR-671-5p, miR-665, miR-663, miR-512-3p and miR-371-5p) are mainly responsible for the dysregulation of STAT3 and hence can provide an opportunity for early detection of metastasis and development of alternative therapeutic approaches. Our findings deliver new details on key functional components in prostate cancer progression and provide opportunities for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches.""","""['Mehdi Sadeghi', 'Bijan Ranjbar', 'Mohamad Reza Ganjalikhany', 'Faiz M Khan', 'Ulf Schmitz', 'Olaf Wolkenhauer', 'Shailendra K Gupta']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Screening the key microRNAs and transcription factors in prostate cancer based on microRNA functional synergistic relationships.', 'MicroRNA profiling reveals dysregulated microRNAs and their target gene regulatory networks in cemento-ossifying fibroma.', 'A Network-Based Integrative Workflow to Unravel Mechanisms Underlying Disease Progression.', 'miR clusters target cellular functional complexes by defining their degree of regulatory freedom.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'A review on the role of miR-671 in human disorders.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Elucidation of dynamic microRNA regulations in cancer progression using integrative machine learning.', 'The Astrogenic Balance in the Aging Brain.', 'HAHmiR.DB: a server platform for high-altitude human miRNA-gene coregulatory networks and associated regulatory circuits.']"""

European Latin countries have some differences in their health system; therefore, it is of interest to compare them in terms of survival from cancer. Prostate cancer data from six countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland) were extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database (end of follow-up: 1 January 2009). First, the net survival (NS) was studied over the 2000-2004 period using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. Trends in NS over the 1989-2004 period and changes in the pattern of cancer excess mortality rate until 5 years after the diagnosis were examined using a multivariate excess mortality rate model. A striking increase in survival from prostate cancer occurred in European Latin countries at all ages studied. In the last period of the study, there was little difference in age-standardized NSs from prostate cancer between the six countries. The trends of the survival followed those of the incidence (except in Spain in the elderly); the increases in incidence were the highest at ages 60-70 years and, in the elderly (around 80 years), the incidence did not increase in Switzerland. The increases in NS can mainly be explained by lead-time and overdiagnosis effects. The epidemiological interpretability of the changes in prostate cancer survival in Latin countries is strongly compromised by the biases inherent to the extensive prostate-specific antigen testing.""","""['Pascale Grosclaude', 'Laurent Roche', 'Rafael Fuentes-Raspall', 'Nerea Larrañaga;GRELL EUROCARE- Working Group']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Trends in net survival from cervical cancer in six European Latin countries: results from the SUDCAN population-based study.', 'Trends in net survival lung cancer in six European Latin countries: results from the SUDCAN population-based study.', 'Trends in net survival from colon cancer in six European Latin countries: results from the SUDCAN population-based study.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

In patients with psychosis, we assessed if socio-developmental background influences abstract thinking, and the association with executive functioning and clinical psychosis symptoms.  Methods:   Participants (n = 174) had a diagnosis of psychotic or bipolar disorder, were 17-65 years, intelligence quotient (IQ) > 70, fluent in a Scandinavian language, and their full primary education in Norway. Immigrants (N = 58) were matched (1:2) with participants without a history of migration (N = 116). All participants completed a neurocognitive and clinical assessment. Socio-developmental background was operationalised as human developmental index (HDI) of country of birth, at year of birth. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the model with best fit.  Results:   The model with best fit, χ2 = 96.591, df = 33, p < .001, confirmed a significant indirect effect of HDI scores on abstract thinking through executive functioning, but not through clinical psychosis symptoms.

Patients and methods:   In all, 224 consecutive patients with the suspicion of PCa were investigated. All patients were evaluated by 3.0-T mpMRI applying the ESUR criteria. All patients underwent free-hand transperineal mpMRI/TRUS fusion TB and additionally a transperineal SB. Pathological findings of TB, SB, and step-sectioned RP specimens were analyzed.  Results:   The median age of the patients was 69 (40-85) years, median PSA level was 10.05 (3.61-78.39) ng/mL, and median prostate volume was 45.5 (22-77) mL. Overall, the PCa detection rate was 50.45% (113/224). TB detected significantly more cancer [44.2% (99/224) vs. 34.8% (78/224); P = 0.001] and clinically significant PCa [75.75% (75/99) vs. 62.82% (49/78); P = 0.005] than SB. For the upgrading of Gleason score, 39.74% (31/78), more clinically significant PCa was detected by using additional TB than by SB alone. Conversely, 5.05% (5/99) more clinically significant PCa was found by SB in addition to that by TB. The location of 96.67% (58/60) and Gleason score of 60% (36/60) of TB-proven ITs were correctly identified, as corroborated by RP specimens. The median IT volume was 1.125 (0.21-19.87) ml on MRI and 1.41 (0.13-9.56) ml in RP specimens.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of current literature (PubMed search) regarding 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET diagnostics in primary staging, in biochemical recurrence and in metastasized disease.  Results:   Compared to conventional imaging, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT reaches a higher sensitivity with an excellent specificity in the clinical diagnosis of primary staging as well as staging for recurrence and advanced, metastasized disease. In biochemical recurrence, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT shows significantly higher detection rates in comparison to choline PET/CT, especially in patients with low PSA values. In the clinical diagnosis of recurrent disease, therapy concepts were changed in more than a quarter of the patients due to the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. The significance of staging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in advanced metastasized patients remains uncertain.

Methods:   This was a prospective controlled study, which included three cancer patient groups and a control group of healthy individuals. The cancer subgroups consisted of renal (n = 44), prostate (n = 56) and bladder cancer (n = 47). We excluded patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, or with significant comorbidity. In all patients, certain coagulation parameters were measured (prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, D-dimers, fibrinogen, F1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complex). Statistical analysis was carried out to explore the association of hemostasis markers with tumor-nodes-metastasis stage, Gleason score, transitional cell carcinoma grade, Fuhrman grade and prostate-specific antigen.  Results:   Our final sample consisted in 58 control patients and 147 patients with urological cancer. We found specific patterns of increased coagulation factors in the different cancers that were statistically significant. Renal cancer showed increased levels of D-dimers, partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen. D-dimers and fibrinogen were increased in prostate cancer; whereas in bladder cancer, only fibrinogen was elevated. Correlations were found between certain factors and tumor stage and grading, with D-dimers being independently associated with higher tumor grade. Thrombin-antithrombin complex was associated with Gleason score. Furthermore, D-dimers, fibrinogen and F1 + 2 were associated with higher tumor stages (II-IV).  Conclusions:   The coagulation pathway seems to be activated in urological malignancies.

Cox proportion models were used to test the association between cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and the cholesterol : high-density lipoprotein ratio with incident lower urinary tract symptoms, defined as first report of medical treatment, surgery or two reports of an International Prostate Symptom Score >14.  Results:   A total of 253 men (10.9%) developed incident lower urinary tract symptoms. On crude analysis, higher high-density lipoprotein was associated with a decreased lower urinary tract symptoms risk (hazard ratio 0.89, P = 0.024), whereas total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein showed no association. After multivariable adjustment, the association between high-density lipoprotein and incident lower urinary tract symptoms remained significant (hazard ratio 0.89, P = 0.044), whereas no association was observed for low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.611). There was a trend for higher cholesterol to be linked with higher lower urinary tract symptoms risk, though this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.04, P = 0.054). A higher cholesterol : high-density lipoprotein ratio was associated with increased lower urinary tract symptoms risk on crude (hazard ratio 1.11, P = 0.016) and adjusted models (hazard ratio 1.12, P = 0.012).  Conclusions:   Among asymptomatic men participating in the REDUCE study, higher cholesterol was associated with increased incident lower urinary tract symptoms risk, though the association was not significant.

Materials and methods:   Thirteen different parameters related to either perfusion or dispersion were extracted pixel-by-pixel from 45 DCE-US recordings in 19 patients referred for radical prostatectomy. Multiparametric maps were retrospectively produced using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm. These were subsequently evaluated on their pixel-wise performance in classifying 43 benign and 42 malignant histopathologically confirmed regions of interest, using a prostate-based leave-one-out procedure.  Results:   The combination of the spatiotemporal correlation (r), mean transit time (μ), curve skewness (κ), and peak time (PT) yielded an accuracy of 81% ± 11%, which was higher than the best performing single parameters: r (73%), μ (72%), and wash-in time (72%).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were employed to detect the expression of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, ERG, MMP-9 and PLXNB1 of 135 human tissues, which included 55 metastatic PCa cases, 50 localized PCa cases and 30 BPH cases. Then using siRNA (anti-ERG, MMP-9 and PLXNB1, respectively) downregulation of the target gene of VCaP and PC-3 cells, MTT and Transwell were performed. The results showed that the positive rate of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was 38.1% (40/105) in total PCa samples, 47.3% (26/55) of metastatic PCa, 28.0% (14/50) of localized PCa, while 0.0% (0/30) in BPH samples. The mRNA and protein expression of ERG, MMP-9 and PLXNB1 were higher in metastatic PCa (P<0.0001), and the mRNA expression of the three genes were positively correlated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusionin PCa group (P<0.0001). siRNA transfected PCa cells can effectively downregulate the target gene expression, and we identified that MMP-9 and PLXNB1 expression were all regulated by TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in the survival of patients diagnosed with mPCa prior to and in the early period of the implementation of these new agents.  Patients and methods:   The study population consisted of 207 men diagnosed in 1997 and 316 men diagnosed in the period 2007-2013 with de novo mPCa and managed with initial endocrine therapy. Men were followed for overall survival and PCa-specific survival.  Results:   At the time of diagnosis, men diagnosed in the period 2007-2013 had less co-morbidity, lower prostrate-specific antigen levels and lower clinical tumour categories than men diagnosed in 1997. A significantly higher proportion of men diagnosed in 1997 were managed with surgical castration (57% versus 9%). Only one patient diagnosed in 1997 received second-line therapy compared with 81 men (26%) diagnosed in the period 2007-2013. The median overall survival was significantly longer for men diagnosed between 2007 and 2013 compared with men diagnosed in 1997 (39.4 months versus 24.2 months, p < 0.0001). Likewise, the cumulative incidence of PCa-specific death was higher among men diagnosed in 1997 compared with men diagnosed between 2007 and 2013, with 5-year cumulative incidences of 72% and 47%, respectively (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Survival in men diagnosed with metastatic PCa has improved significantly over time.

After three rounds of imaging data acquisitions (i.e., quercetin for positive and negative ion detection and 9-aminoacridine for negative ion detection), and metabolite identification, a total of 1091 metabolites including 1032 lipids and 59 other metabolites were routinely detected and successfully localized. Of these compounds, 250 and 217 were only detected in either the cancerous or the non-cancerous regions respectively, although we cannot rule out the presence of these metabolites at concentrations below the detection limit. In addition, 152 of the other 624 metabolites showed differential distributions (p<0.05, t-test) between the two regions of the tissues. Further studies on a larger number of clinical specimens will need to be carried out to confirm this large number of apparently cancer-related metabolites. The successful determination of the spatial locations and abundances of these endogenous biomolecules indicated significant metabolism abnormalities - e.g., increased energy charge and under-expression of neutral acyl glycerides, in the prostate cancer samples.

The aim of this study was to determine whether HRS was preserved throughout a 7-week radiotherapy treatment, and also to examine the rate of foci decline and foci persistence between dose fractions.  Materials and methods:   42 patients with prostate cancer received 7-week fractionated radiotherapy treatment (RT) with daily dose fractions of 0.05-1.10Gy to the skin. Before RT, and at several times throughout treatment, skin biopsies (n=452) were collected at 30min, and 2, 3, 24, and 72h after dose fractions. DSB-foci markers, γH2AX and 53BP1, were labelled in epidermal keratinocytes with immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Foci were counted both with digital image analysis and manually.  Results:   HRS in keratinocytes was evidenced by the dose-response relationships of DSB foci, observed throughout the treatment course, independent of sampling time and quantification method. Foci observed at 24h after dose fractions indicated considerable DSB persistence. Accordingly, foci significantly accumulated after 5 consecutive dose fractions. For doses below 0.3Gy, persistent foci could be observed even at 72h after damage induction. A comparison of γH2AX and 53BP1 quantifications in double-stained biopsies showed similar HRS dose-response relationships.

We evaluated the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) up to 3 months post-BT and lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) resolution (defined as return to within two points of baseline IPSS score) at regular intervals, up to 24 months post-BT. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to evaluate the effect of various patient, tumor, and treatment factors on the risk of AUR and the likelihood of LUTS resolution.  Results:   Ninety-six patients (12%) developed AUR at a median of 1 day post-BT. Increased peak urinary flow is independently associated with lower risk of AUR (odds ratio [OR] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91-0.97).

We studied the level of adherence to recommendations from Dutch national cancer treatment guidelines, and the influence of general and cancer-specific guideline characteristics on adherence.  Methods:   Based on data from a national cancer registry, adherence was evaluated for 15 treatment recommendations for breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer, and melanoma. Recommendations were selected by representatives of the medical specialist associations responsible for developing and implementing the guidelines. We used multivariable multilevel analysis to calculate mean adherence and variation between individual hospitals.  Results:   Mean adherence to the different treatment recommendations ranged from 40 to 99%. Adherence differed only slightly between older and newer guidelines and between recommendations with low, moderate or high levels of evidence (range 79-84% and 77-91%, respectively), while adherence differed more between recommendations for different cancer types (range 54-99%), different treatment modalities (adherence ranged from 40 to 92%) or recommendations that advised against or recommended in favour of particular treatment (adherence ranged from 75 to 98%).  Conclusion:   We found significant variation in adherence between different cancer treatment guidelines. While some guideline characteristics that seem to explain this variation may be considered difficult to modify, the potential for variance across cancer types and treatment modalities suggests that adherence could be further improved. At the same time, these results warrant tailored strategies for the improvement of adherence to clinical practice guidelines.""","""['Marianne J Heins', 'Judith D de Jong', 'Inge Spronk', 'Vincent K Y Ho', 'Mirian Brink', 'Joke C Korevaar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Public Health""","""['Evaluation of Guideline Adherence in Colorectal Cancer Treatment in The Netherlands: A Survey Among Medical Oncologists by the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group.', 'Declined guideline adherence in older breast cancer patients: a population-based study in the Netherlands.', 'Relevance to family practice of English-language guidelines on breast, colorectal and prostate cancer: a review.', ""Labour intensity of guidelines may have a greater effect on adherence than GPs' workload."", 'Recommendations for follow-up of malignant diseases.', 'Nonadherence to Multimodality Cancer Treatment Guidelines in the United States.', 'Prostate Cancer Survival by Risk and Other Prognostic Factors in Mallorca, Spain.', ""Pharmacotherapeutic Patterns and Patients' Access to Pharmacotherapy for Some Rare Diseases in Bulgaria - A Pilot Comparative Study."", 'Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Converting Evidence into Action?', 'Evaluation of the reporting quality of clinical practice guidelines on lung cancer using the RIGHT checklist.']"""

RP and radiation therapy are curative treatments for localized prostate cancer. However, there is controversy around which treatment is superior in Japanese patients. The aim of our retrospective study was to compare the long-term clinical outcomes of each treatment. We retrospectively evaluated the overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and biochemical failure-free survival (BFS) for patients who had been diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and treated with RP (n = 248) or conventional 2D or 3D-CRT EBRT (n = 182) between 1995 and 2009. The median OS was superior in the RP group compared with that in EBRT group (P < 0.001), although CSS was comparable for both treatment groups; BFS was superior for the EBRT group compared with that for the RP group (P = 0.04). Univariate analysis identified a prostate-specific antigen count (PSA)of ≥20 vs <20 mg/ml, clinical T-stage of the tumor and Gleason score as predictors for CSS. However, multivariate analysis did not identify a factor for CSS. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on clinical T stage, PSA and Gleason score, but there was no difference in each subgroup between RP and EBRT.

The difference between the observed and the appropriate RT rate is influenced by the choice of a criterion based benchmarking (CBB) or evidence-based estimates (EBEST) measure. Our primary objective was to determine the utilization of radiotherapy for cancers of the breast (B), cervix (C), lung (L), prostate (P) and rectum (R) in Alberta (AB) Canada and to compare the observed RT rates to estimates of need derived from the criterion based benchmarking (CBB) and evidence-based estimates (EBEST).  Materials and methods:   All incident cases of B,C,L,P and R cancers diagnosed in AB during 2004-8 (prior to the decentralization of provincial RT capacity) were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry. Patients receiving RT within one year (RT-1y) of diagnosis were identified and the proportion receiving RT-1y was then calculated. Factors associated with RT utilization were analysed by region. Estimates of the need for RT were derived from CBB and EBEST methods in the literature.  Results:   A total of n=68,164 cancer cases were identified from the ACR. RT-1y rates (95% C.I.) were B: 51.5% (50.1-52.9), C: 48.9% (43.8-54.0), L: 37.1% (35.4-38.8), P: 26.9% (25.1-28.7) and R: 39.3% (36.5-42.1). Observed rates of RT in AB were lower than estimates derived using the CBB and EBEST estimates. Shortfalls varied across cancer sites according to whether a CBB or EBEST estimate was used ranging from a low of -0.3% in cancer of the cervix to a high of 30.3% in rectal cancer.  Conclusions:   RT shortfalls exist in the utilization of RT in AB, Canada despite centralized cancer care and a publically funded health care system.

This technology offers a number of attractive features in laparoscopy. It overcomes the difficulties with fixed port sites by restoring all 6 degrees of freedom at the instrument tips, provides new possibilities for miniaturization of surgical tasks and allows remote controlled surgery. We investigated the applicability of remote controlled robotic surgery to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Our previous experience with laparoscopic prostatectomy served as a basis for adapting robotic surgery to this procedure. A surgeon at a different location who activated the tele-manipulators of the da Vinci∗ robotic system performed all steps of the intervention. A scrub nurse and second surgeon who stood at patient side had limited roles to port and instrument placement, exposure of the operative field, assistance in hemostasis and removal of the operative specimen. Our patient was a 63-year-old man presenting with a T1c tumor discovered on 1 positive sextant biopsy with a 3+3 Gleason score and 7 ng./ml. preoperative serum prostate specific antigen.  Results:   The robot provided an ergonomic surgical environment and remarkable dexterity enhancement. Operating time was 420 minutes, and the hospital stay lasted 4 days. The bladder catheter was removed 3 days postoperatively, and 1 week later the patient was fully continent. Pathological examination showed a pT3a tumor with negative margins.  Conclusions:   Robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible. This new technology enhances surgical dexterity. Further developments in this field may have new applications in laparoscopic tele-surgery.""","""['Clément-Claude Abbou', 'András Hoznek', 'Laurent Salomon', 'Leif Eric Olsson', 'Adrian Lobontiu', 'Fabien Saint', 'Antony Cicco', 'Patrick Antiphon', 'Dominique Chopin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with a remote controlled robot.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Remote laparoscopic radical prostatectomy carried out with a robot.

The autonomic innervation of the corpora cavernosa in the male fetus and newborn was traced to determine the topographical relationship between the pelvic nerve plexus, and the prostate, urethra and urogenital diaphragm. We have demonstrated that the branches of the pelvic plexus that innervate the corpora cavernosa are situated between the rectum and urethra, and penetrate the urogenital diaphragm near or in the muscular wall of the urethra. Injuries to the pelvic plexus can occur in 2 ways: 1) during division of the lateral pedicle and 2) at the time of apical dissection with transection of the urethra. Thirty-one men who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy were evaluated to determine risk factors that correlated with postoperative impotence: 5 (16 per cent) were fully potent, 7 (23 per cent) had partial erections that were inadequate for sexual intercourse and 19 (61 per cent) had total erectile impotence. The 2 factors that had a favorable influence on postoperative potency were age and pathologic stage of the lesion: 31 per cent of the patients less than 60 years old were potent versus only 6 per cent of the patients more than 60 years, while 33 per cent of the patients with tumor microscopically confined to the prostatic capsule were potent versus only 5 per cent of those with capsular penetration. When the factors of age and capsular penetration were combined 60 per cent of the men less than 60 years old who had an intact prostatic capsule were potent. Arterial insufficiency and psychogenic factors were excluded as major contributing factors by the finding of normal penile blood flow and absence of nocturnal penile tumescence in the impotent patients. We conclude that impotence after radical prostatectomy results from injury to the pelvic nerve plexus that provides autonomic innervation to the corpora cavernosa. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether refinements in surgical technique, especially during ligation of the lateral pedicle and apical dissection, can prevent this complication.""","""['Patrick C Walsh', 'Pieter J Donker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Andrological complications after pancystoprostatovesiculectomy surgery: utility of the bulbocavernosus reflex.', 'Radical prostatectomy with preservation of sexual function: anatomical and pathological considerations.', 'Neuroanatomical approach to radical cystoprostatectomy with preservation of sexual function.', 'Avoiding complications of radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy, preservation of sexual function, cancer control.

Quadrant biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4 μg./l. or digital rectal examination was suspicious, even if transrectal ultrasonography revealed no areas suspicious for cancer. The results showed that 15% of the men had a PSA level of greater than 4 μg./l., 15% had a suspicious digital rectal examination and 26% had suspicious findings on either or both tests. Of 1,167 biopsies performed cancer was detected in 264. PSA detected significantly more tumors (82%, 216 of 264 cancers) than digital rectal examination (55%, 146 of 264, p = 0.001). The cancer detection rate was 3.2% for digital rectal examination, 4.6% for PSA and 5.8% for the 2 methods combined. Positive predictive value was 32% for PSA and 21% for digital rectal examination. Of 160 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and pathological staging 114 (71%) had organ confined cancer: PSA detected 85 (75%) and digital rectal examination detected 64 (56%, p = 0.003). Use of the 2 methods in combination increased detection of organ confined disease by 78% (50 of 64 cases) over digital rectal examination alone. If the performance of a biopsy would have required suspicious transrectal ultrasonography findings, nearly 40% of the tumors would have been missed. We conclude that the use of PSA in conjunction with digital rectal examination enhances early prostate cancer detection.

It is a very common cancer, but has a very low mortality rate because it comprises two types of disease: one insignificant, indolent, and much more common, and the other aggressive, significant, and much less common. The routine diagnostic approach to prostate cancer has been systematic blind biopsies, which has low detection rates and might detect low risk, insignificant prostate cancer, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancers.

We herein investigated the potential role of eHsp90 as a modulator of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in prostate cancer (PCa). We report a novel function for eHsp90 as a facilitator of PCa stemness, determined by its ability to upregulate stem-like markers, promote self-renewal, and enhance prostasphere growth. Moreover, eHsp90 increased the side population typically correlated with the drug-resistant phenotype. Intriguingly, tumor cells with elevated surface eHsp90 exhibited a marked increase in stem-like markers coincident with increased expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) effector Snail, indicating that surface eHsp90 may enrich for a unique CSC population. Our analysis of distinct effectors modulating the eHsp90-dependent CSC phenotyperevealed that eHsp90 is a likely facilitator of stem cell heterogeneity.

Ligand-activated AR engages androgen response elements (AREs) at androgen-responsive genes to drive the expression of gene batteries involved in cell proliferation and cell fate. Understanding the transcriptional targets of the AR has become critical in apprehending the mechanisms driving treatment-resistant stages of PCa. Although AR transcription regulation has been extensively studied, the signaling networks downstream of AR are incompletely described. Semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) is a secreted signaling protein with roles in nervous system and cardiac development but can also drive cellular growth and invasive characteristics in multiple cancers including PCa. Despite numerous findings that implicate SEMA3C in cancer progression, regulatory mechanisms governing its expression remain largely unknown. Here we identify and characterize an androgen response element within the SEMA3C locus. Using the AR-positive LNCaP PCa cell line, we show that SEMA3C expression is driven by AR through this element and that AR-mediated expression of SEMA3C is dependent on the transcription factor GATA2. SEMA3C has been shown to promote cellular growth in certain cell types so implicit to our findings is the discovery of direct regulation of a growth factor by AR.

In this study, we examined the role of HnRNP-L in prostate cancer (Pca). We found that HnRNP-L is overexpressed in prostate tissue samples from 160 PC patients compared with tissue samples from 32 donors with cancers other than Pca. Moreover, HnRNP-L positively correlated with aggressive tumor characteristics. HnRNP-L knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis of Pca cell lines in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth when the cells were subcutaneously implanted in an athymic mouse model. Conversely, overexpression of HnRNP-L promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth while prohibiting cell apoptosis. HnRNP-L promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth in Pca in part by interacting with endogenous p53 mRNA, which was closely associated with cyclin p21. In addition, HnRNP-L affected cell apoptosis by directly binding the classical apoptosis protein BCL-2. These observations suggest HnRNP-L is an important regulatory factor that exerts pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects in Pca through actions affecting the cell cycle and intrinsic apoptotic signaling.

We herein propose modifications to improve the performance of PRS. We introduce threshold-dependent winner's-curse adjustments for marginal association coefficients that are used to weight the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PRS. Further, as a way to incorporate external functional/annotation knowledge that could identify subsets of SNPs highly enriched for associations, we propose variable thresholds for SNPs selection. We applied our methods to GWAS summary-level data of 14 complex diseases. Across all diseases, a simple winner's curse correction uniformly led to enhancement of performance of the models, whereas incorporation of functional SNPs was beneficial only for selected diseases. Compared to the standard PRS algorithm, the proposed methods in combination led to notable gain in efficiency (25-50% increase in the prediction R2) for 5 of 14 diseases. As an example, for GWAS of type 2 diabetes, winner's curse correction improved prediction R2 from 2.29% based on the standard PRS to 3.10% (P = 0.0017) and incorporating functional annotation data further improved R2 to 3.53% (P = 2×10-5).

However, ADT invariably leads to the development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with restored activity of AR. CRPC can be further treated with CYP17 inhibitors to block androgen synthesis pathways, but most patients still relapse after a year of such treatment. The mechanisms that drive this progression are not fully understood, but AR activity, at least in a subset of cancers, appears to be restored again. Importantly, AR mutations are more frequently detected in this type of cancer. By analyzing tumor biopsy mRNA from CRPC patients who had developed resistance to CYP17 inhibitor treatment, we have identified a novel nonsense mutation (Q784*) at the ligand binding domain (LBD) of AR, which produces a C-terminal truncated AR protein that lacks intact LBD. This AR-Q784* mutant is transcriptionally inactive, but it is constitutively expressed in the nucleus and can bind to DNA in the absence of androgen. Significantly, our results show that AR-Q784* can heterodimerize with, and enhance the transcriptional activity of, full-length AR. Moreover, expressing AR-Q784* in an AR positive PCa cell line enhances the chromatin binding of endogenous AR and the recruitment of p300 coactivator under the low androgen condition, leading to increased cell growth. This activity of AR-Q784* mimics the function of some AR splice variants, indicating that CYP17 inhibitor treatment in CRPC may select for LBD-truncated forms of AR to restore AR signaling.""","""['Dong Han', 'Shuai Gao', 'Kevin Valencia', 'Jude Owiredu', 'Wanting Han', 'Eric de Waal', 'Jill A Macoska', 'Changmeng Cai']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Androgen receptor variants: another twist in the plot.', 'Abiraterone treatment in castration-resistant prostate cancer selects for progesterone responsive mutant androgen receptors.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A bypass mechanism of abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer: Accumulating CYP17A1 substrates activate androgen receptor signaling.', 'Genomic Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA in 3,334 Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer Identifies Targetable BRCA Alterations and AR Resistance Mechanisms.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.', 'Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Refractory to Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Axis-Targeted Agents: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The BET-inhibitor PFI-1 diminishes AR/AR-V7 signaling in prostate cancer cells.']"""

To date, limited data are available regarding reasons why men with low-risk LPC adopt AS.  Purpose:   The aim of this study is to better understand conceptualizations, experiences and reasons why men with low-risk LPC and their partners adopt AS.  Methods:   We conducted five focus groups (FGs), three among men with low-risk LPC who had chosen AS and two with their partners. FGs were video/audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative thematic analysis.  Results:   A total of 12 men and 6 partners (all women) participated in FG discussions. The most common reasons for choosing AS were seeing the LPC as 'small' or 'low grade' without need for immediate treatment and trusting their physician's AS recommendation. The most common concerns about AS were perceived unreliability of prostate specific antigen, pain associated with prostate biopsies and potential cancer progression. Partners saw themselves as very involved in their husbands' treatment decision-making process, more than men acknowledged them to be. Multiple terms including 'watchful waiting' were used interchangeably with AS. There appeared to be a lack of understanding that AS is not simply 'doing nothing' but is actually a recognized management option for low-risk LPC.  Conclusions:   Emphasizing the low risk of a man's LPC and enhancing physician trust may increase acceptability of AS. Standardizing terminology and presenting AS as a reasonable and recognized management option may also help increase its adoption.""","""['Arun Mallapareddi', 'Julie Ruterbusch', 'Elyse Reamer', 'Susan Eggly', 'Jinping Xu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Fam Pract""","""[""'What is this active surveillance thing?'

Ventral hernia (VH) has been increasingly recognized as an important complication after laparoscopic procedures, in general. However, data related to VH after robotic procedures is relatively scarce, especially after RRP. With increasing popularity of RRP, the purpose of this study was to look at the incidence of VH and outcomes of ventral hernia repair (VHR) after RRP.  Methods:   All patients who underwent RRP at a single institution between January 2012 and June 2014 were studied retrospectively using electronic medical records.  Results:   A total of 570 patients underwent RRP, of which 33 (5.8%) developed VH during the study period. Fourteen (42%) patients were obese and five (15%) had diabetes. One patient (3%) had a surgical site infection after RRP and two (6%) patients were on immunomodulators/steroids. Median duration to develop VH after RRP was 12 (1-25) months. Out of the 33 patients with VH, ten (33%) underwent VHR; five laparoscopic and five open. Median size of hernia defect and mesh used was 25 (1-144) cm2 and 181 (15-285) cm2, respectively. Median length of hospital stay and follow up was 0 (0-4) days and 12 (1-14) months, respectively. One patient who had initial VHR done at an outside institution had a recurrence. Thirty-two (97%) patients were alive at their last follow up. One patient died secondary to progression of prostate cancer. There was no significant 30 day morbidity (surgical site infection, fascial dehiscence, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction). Of patients who decided non-operative management of VH (n = 23, 67%), none developed a complication requiring emergent surgical intervention.  Conclusion:   The incidence of VH after RRP is likely underreported in prior studies. Repair, either laparoscopic or open, is safe and effective in experienced hands. Patients who decide on watchful waiting can be followed with minimal risk of incarceration/strangulation. Further studies are needed to analyze the extraction techniques after RRP and correlate with incidence of VH.""","""['A Ashfaq', 'K Ahmadieh', 'A A Shah', 'E M Garvey', 'A B Chapital', 'D J Johnson', 'K L Harold']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Surg""","""['Laparoscopic repair of extraction site ventral hernia after robotic prostatectomy: institutional experience with 42 consecutive cases.', 'Robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair: a multicenter evaluation of clinical outcomes.', 'Outcomes of concomitant ventral hernia repair performed during bariatric surgery.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: our experience and review of the literature.']"""

Objective:   The purpose of this study was to synthesize and characterize a novel 18F labeled leucine analog, 5-[18F]fluoroleucine, as a potential imaging agent for aggressive tumors which may not be amenable to imaging by FDG PET.  Methods:   5-fluoroleucine was synthesized and characterized, and its 18F-labeled analog was synthesized from a mesylate precursor. First, breast cancer cell line assays were performed to evaluate uptake of 3H- or 14C-labeled L-leucine and other essential amino acids. Both L-leucine and 5- [18F]fluoroleucine were tested for uptake and accumulation over time, and for uptake via LAT1. Biodistribution studies were performed to estimate radiation dosimetry for human studies. Small animal PET / CT studies of a breast cancer were performed to evaluate in vivo 5-[18F]fluoroleucine tumor uptake.  Results:   Breast cancer cell lines showed increasing high net accumulation of L-[14C]leucine. Both L-leucine and 5-[18F]fluoroleucine showed increasing uptake over time in in vitro tumor cell assays, and uptake was also shown to occur via LAT1. The biodistribution study of 5-[18F]fluoroleucine showed rapid renal excretion, no significant in vivo metabolism, and acceptable dosimetry for use in humans. In vivo small animal PET / CT imaging of a breast cancer xenograft showed uptake of 5- [18F]fluoroleucine in the tumor, which progressively increased over time.  Conclusion:   5-[18F]fluoroleucine is a leucine analog which may be useful in identifying tumors with high or upregulated expression of amino acid transporters, providing additional information that may not be provided by FDG PET.""","""['Bennett B Chin', 'Darryl McDougald', 'Douglas H Weitzel', 'Thomas Hawk', 'Robert E Reiman', 'Michael R Zalutsky', 'Ganesan Vaidyanathan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Curr Radiopharm""","""['5-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-L-tryptophan as a substrate of system L transport for tumor imaging by PET.', '18FAmylovis as a Potential PET Probe for β-Amyloid Plaque: Synthesis, In Silico, In vitro and In vivo Evaluations.', 'Radiopharmacological evaluation of 6-deoxy-6-18Ffluoro-D-fructose as a radiotracer for PET imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer.', 'Synthesis and biological properties of radiohalogenated α,α-disubstituted amino acids for PET and SPECT imaging of amino acid transporters (AATs).', '5-(2-18FFluoroethoxy)-L-tryphan.', '18F-Branched-Chain Amino Acids: Structure-Activity Relationships and PET Imaging Potential.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism as a Target for Breast Cancer Imaging.']"""

We evaluated treatment with ipilimumab in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer without visceral metastases. Patients and Methods In this multicenter, double-blind, phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo maintenance therapy was administered to nonprogressing patients every 3 months. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Results Four hundred patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab and 202 to placebo; 399 were treated with ipilimumab and 199 with placebo. Median OS was 28.7 months (95% CI, 24.5 to 32.5 months) in the ipilimumab arm versus 29.7 months (95% CI, 26.1 to 34.2 months) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95.87% CI, 0.88 to 1.39; P = .3667). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months in the ipilimumab arm versus 3.8 with placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95.87% CI, 0.55 to 0.81). Exploratory analyses showed a higher prostate-specific antigen response rate with ipilimumab (23%) than with placebo (8%). Diarrhea (15%) was the only grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse event (AE) reported in ≥ 10% of ipilimumab-treated patients. Nine (2%) deaths occurred in the ipilimumab arm due to treatment-related AEs; no deaths occurred in the placebo arm. Immune-related grade 3 to 4 AEs occurred in 31% and 2% of patients, respectively. Conclusion Ipilimumab did not improve OS in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The detection was based on that the variation of electron transfer resistance (Rct) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current were relevant to the formation of PSA-aptamer complex at the modified electrode surface. Compared with pure AuNPs, rGO-MWCNT and MWCNT/AuNPs, the rGO-MWCNT/AuNPs nanocomposite modified electrode was the most sensitive aptasensing platform for the determination of PSA. Two calibration curves were prepared from the data obtained from the DPV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by plotting the peak current and Rct against PSA concentration, respectively. The proposed aptasensor had an extremely low LOD of 1.0pgmL-1 PSA within the detection range of 0.005-20ngmL-1 and 0.005-100ngmL-1 for DPV and EIS calibration curves, respectively. This sensor exhibited outstanding anti-interference ability towards co-existing molecules with good stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility. Clinical application was performed with analysis of the PSA levels in serum samples obtained from patients with prostate cancer using both the aptasensor and Immunoradiometric assay.

This is because nucleotide substitutions (eg, G→T at rs6922) of the enhancer eQTLs may cause low expression of SNHG5 gene, and low expression of snoRNA U50, a product generated from introns of the SNHG5gene, can induce cancer. One presently identified eQTL for the PEX6 gene was rs10948059, which had been associated with prostate cancer from previous association studies.

Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare K, Kep, and Ve values between PCa and noncancerous tissue.  Results:   Fourteen studies representing 484 patients highly suspicious for prostate adenocarcinoma were selected for the meta-analysis. We found that K values measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) were significantly higher in PCa tissue than in noncancerous tissue in the PZ (SMD 1.57, 95% CI 0.98-2.16; z = 5.21, P <0.00001) and CG (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.46-1.91; z = 3.21, P = 0.001). Kep values measured by DCE-MRI were significantly higher in PCa than in noncancerous tissue in the PZ (SMD 1.41, 95% CI 0.92-1.91; z = 5.59, P < 0.00001) and CG (SMD 1.57, 95% CI 0.69-2.46; z = 3.49, P = 0.0005). Ve values generated by DCE-MRI were slightly higher in PCa than in noncancerous tissue in the PZ (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.17-1.27; z = 2.58, P = 0.010), but sensitivity analysis found that the Ve value was unstable for differentiation between PCa and noncancerous PZ tissue. However, there was no significant difference in the Ve value between PCa and noncancerous CG tissue (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -1.18, 0.59; z = 0.65, P = 0.51).  Conclusion:   Our meta-analysis shows that K and Kep were the most reliable parameters for differentiating PCa from noncancerous tissue and were critical for evaluation of the internal structure of cancer. The Ve value was not helpful for distinguishing PCa from noncancerous CG tissue; its ability to distinguish between PCa and noncancerous PZ tissue remains uncertain.""","""['Peng Gao', 'Changzheng Shi', 'Lianping Zhao', 'Quan Zhou', 'Liangping Luo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['DCE-MRI of the prostate using shutter-speed vs. Tofts model for tumor characterization and assessment of aggressiveness.', 'Arterial input function for quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative assessment of dynamic 18F-flumethycholine PET and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in high risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Longitudinal Correlations Between Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) MRI During Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Used to Detect Prostate Cancer and Stratify Tumor Grade: A Meta-Analysis.', 'CT Densitometry and Morphology of Radiofrequency-Ablated Stage IA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Results from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4033 (Alliance) Trial.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer using DCE-MRI habitat descriptors.', 'Assessing Microcirculation in Resectable Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI for Identifying Primary tumour and Lymphatic Metastasis.']"""

FKBP51 expression correlates with metastatic potential in melanoma and prostate cancer. However, the functions of FKBP51, particularly involving the regulation of cell motility and invasion, are not fully understood. We discovered two novel interacting partner proteins of FKBP51, i.e., deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and deleted in liver cancer 2 (DLC2), using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. DLC1 and DLC2 are Rho GTPase-activating proteins that are frequently downregulated in various cancers. Next, we demonstrated that overexpression of FKBP51 enhances cell motility and invasion of U2OS cells via upregulation of RhoA activity and enhanced Rho-ROCK signaling. Moreover, FKBP51-depleted cells displayed a cortical distribution of actin filaments and decreased cell motility and invasion. Consistent with this phenotype, FKBP51 depletion caused a downregulation of RhoA activity. Considered together, our results demonstrate that FKBP51 positively controls cell motility by promoting RhoA and ROCK activation; thus, we have revealed a novel role for FKBP51 in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration and invasion.""","""['Miho Takaoka', 'Shun Ito', 'Yoshio Miki', 'Akira Nakanishi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Formin-like2 regulates Rho/ROCK pathway to promote actin assembly and cell invasion of colorectal cancer.', 'DLC1 induces expression of E-cadherin in prostate cancer cells through Rho pathway and suppresses invasion.', 'Flavone inhibits migration through DLC1/RhoA pathway by decreasing ROS generation in breast cancer cells.', 'FilGAP and its close relatives: a mediator of Rho-Rac antagonism that regulates cell morphology and migration.', 'Role of DLC-1, a tumor suppressor protein with RhoGAP activity, in regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell motility.', 'SAFit2 reduces neuroinflammation and ameliorates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.', 'Tacrolimus Causes Hypertension by Increasing Vascular Contractility via RhoA (Ras Homolog Family Member A)/ROCK (Rho-Associated Protein Kinase) Pathway in Mice.', 'The deficiency of FKBP-5 inhibited hepatocellular progression by increasing the infiltration of distinct immune cells and inhibiting obesity-associated gut microbial metabolite.', 'StarD13 differentially regulates migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells.', 'Post-translational modifications and stress adaptation: the paradigm of FKBP51.']"""

We have previously shown that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is implicated in cell morphology regulation in PCa. Here, through a multi 'omics' approach we define the HO-1 interactome in PCa, identifying HO-1 molecular partners associated with the integrity of the cellular cytoskeleton. The bioinformatics screening for these cytoskeletal-related partners reveal that they are highly misregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma compared with normal prostate tissue. Under HO-1 induction, PCa cells present reduced frequency in migration events, trajectory and cell velocity and, a significant higher proportion of filopodia-like protrusions favoring zippering among neighboring cells. Moreover forced expression of HO-1 was also capable of altering cell protrusions in transwell co-culture systems of PCa cells with MC3T3 cells (pre-osteoblastic cell line). Accordingly, these effects were reversed under siHO. Transcriptomics profiling evidenced significant modulation of key markers related to cell adhesion and cell-cell communication under HO-1 induction.

Some of them are expressed in tumor cells, such as the OR51E2 receptor overexpressed in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. It is considered a prostate tumor marker. We previously demonstrated that this receptor is able to promote LNCaP cell invasiveness in vitro upon stimulation with its odorant agonist β-ionone, leading to increased generation of metastases in vivo. In the present study, we show that even a relatively short exposure to β-ionone is sufficient to promote metastasis emergence. Moreover, α-ionone, considered an OR51E2 antagonist, in fact promotes prostate tumor growth in vivo. The combination of α-ionone with β-ionone triggers a higher increase in the total tumor burden than each molecule alone. To support the in vivo results, we demonstrate in vitro that α-ionone is a real agonist of OR51E2, mainly sustaining LNCaP cell growth, while β-ionone mainly promotes cell invasiveness. So, while structurally close, α-ionone and β-ionone appear to induce different cellular effects, both leading to increased tumor aggressiveness.

In this report, we show that tumor-initiating cells (TICs), represented by spheres derived from the MCF7 cell line, exhibit higher intracellular labile iron pool, mitochondrial iron accumulation and are more susceptible to iron chelation. TICs also show activation of the IRP/IRE system, leading to higher iron uptake and decrease in iron storage, suggesting that level of properly assembled cytosolic iron-sulfur clusters (FeS) is reduced. This finding is confirmed by lower enzymatic activity of aconitase and FeS cluster biogenesis enzymes, as well as lower levels of reduced glutathione, implying reduced FeS clusters synthesis/utilization in TICs. Importantly, we have identified specific gene signature related to iron metabolism consisting of genes regulating iron uptake, mitochondrial FeS cluster biogenesis and hypoxic response (ABCB10, ACO1, CYBRD1, EPAS1, GLRX5, HEPH, HFE, IREB2, QSOX1 and TFRC). Principal component analysis based on this signature is able to distinguish TICs from cancer cells in vitro and also Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) from non-LICs in the mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Majority of the described changes were also recapitulated in an alternative model represented by MCF7 cells resistant to tamoxifen (TAMR) that exhibit features of TICs.

Of the nine men (34.6%) who were found to have Gleason ≥7 on repeat biopsy, all displayed temporal ERG concordance. Prioritized genetic alterations were detected in 50% (13/26) of paired samples. Oncogenic mutations were detected in 22% (2/9) of Gleason 6 cancers prior to progression and 44% (4/9) of Gleason ≥7 cancers when progression occurred.Conclusions: Precise tracking of prostate cancer foci via MRI/US fusion biopsy allowed subsequent resampling of the same clonal focus of cancer over time.

Mechanisms driving IRAEs are generally unknown. Because CTLA-4 blockade leads to proliferation of circulating T cells, we examined in this study whether ipilimumab treatment leads to clonal expansion of tissue-reactive T cells. Rather than narrowing the T-cell repertoire to a limited number of clones, ipilimumab induced greater diversification in the T-cell repertoire in IRAE patients compared with patients without IRAEs. Specifically, ipilimumab triggered increases in the numbers of clonotypes, including newly detected clones and a decline in overall T-cell clonality. Initial broadening in the repertoire occurred within 2 weeks of treatment, preceding IRAE onset. IRAE patients exhibited greater diversity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but showed no differences in regulatory T-cell numbers relative to patients without IRAEs. Prostate-specific antigen responses to ipilimumab were also associated with increased T-cell diversity. Our results show how rapid diversification in the immune repertoire immediately after checkpoint blockade can be both detrimental and beneficial for patients with cancer.

More than a half of cancer patients suffer from various forms of pain, which becomes more frequent and intense as disease progresses.  Objective:   The objective of the study was to assess the degree of pain control in patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer. The analysis also covered the effect of socio-economic factors on pain management in patients with the above types of cancer.  Materials and method:   The study included 902 patients treated at the Outpatient's Department of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center - Institute of Oncology in Warsaw in 2013. The patients consisted of those diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate carcinoma. The Paper and Pencil Interview (PAPI) technique was applied. A questionnaire interview included demographic-type questions (socio-economic variables) and the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ) test which measures the power of factors influencing pain control in patients.  Results:   It was demonstrated that regarding beliefs in the source of pain control, patients attributed the highest importance to the power of doctors (mean value = 16.60) and the lowest to chance events (mean = 15.82). The internal factors are regarded as having the strongest influence by respondents diagnosed with colorectal or breast cancer. With regards to the locus of pain control, only the internal control of pain is diversified by the primary site.  Conclusions:   With regards to the source of pain management, only the internal control of pain is diversified by the primary site. The external factors were regarded as having the strongest influence by respondents diagnosed with colorectal or breast cancer. The major socio-economic variables differentiating the way in which pain control is perceived are education and net income-per-household-member.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) may be considered as a preventable risk factor. In this study, we assessed the frequencies of HPV infection in prostatic adenocarcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases in Northeast Mexico. Materials and Methods: A total of 87 paraffin-embedded blocks (from 25 and 62 patients with definite diagnoses of BPH and adenocarcinoma, respectively) were selected and subjected to INNOLiPA HPV Genotyping to detect 28 high- and low-risk HPV types. The rates of infection were compared in the two studied groups. Results: INNOLiPA HPV demonstrated great sensitivity for HPV detection on paraffin-embedded tissue. Global prevalence was 14.9% (13/87). HPV infection was positive in 19.4% (12/62) of patients with adenocarcinoma and 4.0% (1/25) of patients with BPH. HPV-11, which is considered to be low risk, was more prevalent. Interestingly, one patient with BPH and six with prostate cancer showed examples considered to be high risk (HPV-18, -51, -52, and -66). Conclusion: A higher rate of HPV infection among Mexican patients with prostatic carcinoma than among those with BPH was observed. HPV infections may thus contribute to the risk of prostate cancer.

In this study, a flexible aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimera was designed to combine efficient delivery and increased flexibility. Our chimera incorporated an RNA aptamer that specifically binds prostate cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen as a ligand. Cationic liposomes were linked to aptamers by the post-insertion method and were used to deliver therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 that target the survival gene, polo-like kinase 1, in tumor cells. We demonstrate that the aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimeras had a significant cell-type binding specificity and a remarkable gene silencing effect in vitro. Furthermore, silencing promoted a conspicuous regression of prostate cancer in vivo.

A newly discovered NCWP, Wnt5/Fzd2, has been shown to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancers, but has not been investigated in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate if the CWP and NCWP, in combination with EMT, are associated with metabolic alterations, aggressive disease and biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer. An initial analysis was performed using integrated transcriptomics, ex vivo and in vivo metabolomics, and histopathology of prostatectomy samples (n=129), combined with at least five-year follow-up. This analysis detected increased activation of NCWP through Wnt5a/ Fzd2 as the most common mode of Wnt activation in prostate cancer. This activation was associated with increased expression of EMT markers and higher Gleason score. The transcriptional association between NCWP and EMT was confirmed in five other publicly available patient cohorts (1519 samples in total). A novel gene expression signature of concordant activation of NCWP and EMT (NCWP-EMT) was developed, and this signature was significantly associated with metastasis and shown to be a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence. The NCWP-EMT signature was also associated with decreased concentrations of the metabolites citrate and spermine, which have previously been linked to aggressive prostate cancer.

The optimal dosing interval for zoledronic acid is uncertain.  Objective:   To determine whether zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks is noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks.  Design, setting, participants:   Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 269 academic and community sites in the United States. Patients (n = 1822) with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma who had at least 1 site of bone involvement were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2012; follow-up concluded in April 2014.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid administered intravenously every 4 weeks (n = 911) vs every 12 weeks (n = 911) for 2 years.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the proportion of patients having at least 1 skeletal-related event (defined as clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone) within 2 years after randomization and a between-group absolute difference of 7% as the noninferiority margin. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event by disease type, pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0-10; higher scores indicate worse pain), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse disability), incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, kidney dysfunction, skeletal morbidity rate (mean number of skeletal-related events per year), and, in a subset of 553 patients, suppression of bone turnover (assessed by C-terminal telopeptide levels).  Results:   Among 1822 patients who were randomized (median age, 65 years; 980 [53.8%] women; 855 with breast cancer, 689 with prostate cancer, and 278 with multiple myeloma), 795 completed the study at 2 years. A total of 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the every 12-week dosing group experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event within 2 years of randomization (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to ∞]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. Pain scores, performance status scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical in both groups, but bone turnover was greater (C-terminal telopeptide levels were higher) among patients who received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared with the standard dosing interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal events over 2 years.

Background:   There is a lack of information on the process of implementing psychosocial interventions in controlled trials and, in particular, on the role and performance of facilitators who deliver them. Yet, this information is crucial in assessing whether these interventions are effective or not and why.  Design:   Qualitative design.  Methods:   Semi-structured qualitative interviews and diaries were used to collect data (January-October 2012) from four facilitators and a co-facilitator. Data were analysed using the Miles et al.  Results:   Five themes were discernible. These were 'difficulties to keep to the structure of the intervention', 'selective coverage of topics', 'partner participation', 'overall impression of the group and telephone sessions' and 'perceived benefits to participants'. Issues such as not keeping to the aim of the intervention, deviating from the content and/or reluctance in discussing sensitive issues such as sexual health may mean that the psychosocial effects of the intervention may not have been fully realized.  Conclusions:   These findings will be useful for further development and evaluation of the intervention. A tentative conceptual framework of factors, related to facilitators, influencing the fidelity of interventions in the context of controlled trials, is offered.

An HDR brachytherapy boost is an effective strategy for dose escalation, since it exploits the low α/β ratio in prostate cancer, allowing the delivery of a high biological dose to the tumour. We sought to evaluate the biochemical disease free survival in patients with intermediate and high risk localised prostate cancer treated with EBRT plus HDR brachytherapy as a boost, in our institution.  Patients and methods:   Biochemical outcome was collected prospectively in 95 patients treated from 2008 to 2010, with an HDR boost of 12.5Gy followed by EBRT delivered as 37.5Gy in 15 fractions over 3weeks. The ASTRO definition of biochemical failure (2μg/L above PSA nadir) was used as the outcome measure. 61/95 (64%) were classified as high risk (stage>T2b or PSA>20μg/L or Gleason score>7) while 34/95 (36%) were intermediate risk. 92/95 (97%) patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Adjuvant hormone therapy was at the discretion of the treating clinician.  Results:   The median follow-up for the cohort was 65months (range, 18-88) with a 5-year biochemical DFS of 80.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 72.8-89.0). The prognostic factors used in the analysis model were: clinical stage, presenting PSA, duration of ADT, Gleason score, risk category, prostate volume, D90 and V100. Only presenting PSA (HR 1.03; CI 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) predicted for a poorer biochemical DFS on multivariate analysis.  Conclusion:   These data confirm that EBRT plus a single-fraction HDR brachytherapy boost achieves good biochemical control in a cohort of predominantly high risk patients.""","""['Nuradh Joseph', 'Cathy Taylor', ""Catherine O'Hara"", 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Tony Elliott', 'John Logue', 'James Wylie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Long-term outcome by risk factors using conformal high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) boost with or without neoadjuvant androgen suppression for localized prostate cancer.', 'Long term results of a prospective dose escalation phase-II trial: interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy as boost for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Interim report of image-guided conformal high-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with unfavorable prostate cancer: the William Beaumont phase II dose-escalating trial.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'High weekly integral dose and larger fraction size increase risk of fatigue and worsening of functional outcomes following radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Low-/high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy: long-term results from a single institution team experience.', 'Unexpected lower biochemical control of high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost than low-dose-rate brachytherapy boost for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Building a High-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy Program With Real-Time Ultrasound-Based Planning: Initial Safety, Quality, and Outcome Results.', 'High dose-rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

The levels of TIMP4 and miR-200b-3p expression were determined by real time PCR in 27 prostate carcinomas and eight benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. We found that miR-200b-3p positively correlated with TIMP4 expression in cancer samples (r = 0.46; p < 0.02). Moreover, mean miR-200b-3p level and TIMP4 expression were both higher in cancer tissues compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia samples (p > 0.05). Next, to test probable mechanisms of the regulation androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP) were transfected with synthetic-miR-200b-3p or its synthetic antagonist. Modulation of miR-200b-3p in LNCaP cells had an impact on TIMP4 expression confirming the observation made in analyzed clinical samples. Two targets of miR-200b-3p: ZEB1 and ETS1 were investigated subsequently as potential regulators of TIMP4, however, no effect of their modulation on TIMP4 expression in LNCaP cells was found.

As a treatment goal, suppression of plasma testosterone levels to <50 ng/dl has been established over decades. Evidence is growing though that suppression to even lower levels may add further clinical benefit. Therefore, we undertook a pooled retrospective analysis on the efficacy of 1-, 3-, and 6-month sustained-release (SR) formulations of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist triptorelin to suppress serum testosterone concentrations beyond current standards.  Methods:   Data of 920 male patients with PC enrolled in 9 prospective studies using testosterone serum concentrations as primary endpoint were pooled. Patients aged 42-96 years had to be eligible for ADT and to be either naïve to hormonal treatment or have undergone appropriate washout prior to enrolment. Patients were treated with triptorelin SR formulations for 2-12 months. Primary endpoints of this analysis were serum testosterone concentrations under treatment and success rates overall and per formulation, based on a testosterone target threshold of 20 ng/dl.  Results:   After 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment, 79%, 92%, 93%, 90%, and 91% of patients reached testosterone levels <20 ng/dl, respectively. For the 1-, 3-, and 6-month formulations success rates ranged from 80-92%, from 83-93%, and from 65-97% with median (interquartile range) serum testosterone values of 2.9 (2.9-6.5), 5.0 (2.9-8.7), and 8.7 (5.8-14.1) ng/dl at study end, respectively.  Conclusion:   In the large majority of patients, triptorelin SR formulations suppressed serum testosterone concentrations to even <20 ng/dl. Testosterone should be routinely monitored in PC patients on ADT although further studies on the clinical benefit of very low testosterone levels and the target concentrations are still warranted.""","""['Jürgen Breul', 'Eija Lundström', 'Daniela Purcea', 'Werner P Venetz', 'Patrick Cabri', 'Pascale Dutailly', 'Evan R Goldfischer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['Polymer-delivered subcutaneous leuprolide acetate formulations achieve and maintain castrate concentrations of testosterone in four open-label studies in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Comparative efficacy of triptorelin pamoate and leuprolide acetate in men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'An Update on Triptorelin: Current Thinking on Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of urinary prostate cancer antigen-3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2-ERG score changes when starting androgen-deprivation therapy with triptorelin 6-month formulation in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Triptorelin in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Management of Pathologic Node-Positive Prostate Cancer following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Androgen deprivation monotherapy usage in non-metastatic prostate cancer: results from eight European countries.', 'Interleukin-6 and Lymphocyte Count Associated and Predicted the Progression of Frailty Syndrome in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Effectiveness of three different luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in the chemical castration of patients with prostate cancer: Goserelin versus triptorelin versus leuprolide.', 'Androgen-targeted therapy in men with prostate cancer: evolving practice and future considerations.']"""

The primary objective was to study the relationship between mean ABI plasma exposure (ABI Cmin) and 3-month PSA response.  Results:   From 2012 to 2016, 61 mCRPC patients were eligible for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment. Thirty-eight patients experienced PSA response (62%, [confidence interval {CI} 95% 50-78]). In univariate analysis, ABI Cmin was 1.5-fold higher in responders: 12.0 ng/mL (CI 95% 9.4-15.6) versus 8.0 ng/mL (CI 95% 5.8-11.6; P = 0.0015). In multivariate analysis, only ABI Cmin was independently associated with PSA response (odds ratio = 1.12 [CI 95% 1.01-1.25], P = 0.004). By receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal threshold for ABI Cmin was 8.4 ng/mL. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in patients with ABI Cmin above 8.4 ng/mL (hazard ratio 0.55, [CI 95% 0.31-0.99], 12.2 [CI 95% 9.2-19.5] versus 7.4 [CI 95% 5.5-14.7] months otherwise, P = 0.044).

However, little is known about possible predictors for negative intrusive thoughts among this group. We aimed to identify health- and care-related predictors for such thoughts among a population of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   In the LAPPRO-trial, 3154 men (80%) answered study-specific questionnaires at admission and 3 months after surgery. Questions concerned socio-demographics, health, uncertainty, preparedness for symptoms, and the outcome-negative intrusive thoughts. Associations between variables were analyzed by log-binominal and multivariable approach.  Results:   The strongest predictor of negative intrusive thoughts at admission to surgery was uncertainty of cure, followed by binge drinking, poor physical health, antidepressant medication, not being prepared for urinary symptoms, age under 55, and physical pain. Reporting it not probable to obtain urinary symptoms after surgery lowered the odds. Negative intrusive thoughts before surgery were the strongest predictor for such thoughts 3 months later followed by uncertainty of cure, physical pain, younger age, living alone, and poor self-reported physical health.  Conclusions:   Our findings showed an association of preoperative uncertainty of cure as well as low preparedness for well-known surgery-induced symptoms with higher occurrence of negative intrusive thoughts about prostate cancer.

To the authors' knowledge, there are limited data regarding which factors predict SREs. The authors identified risk factors for SREs in men with bone mCRPC using characteristics commonly available in the medical record.  Methods:   Data from 454 patients with nonmetastatic CRPC were identified from 2 Veteran Affairs Medical Centers from 2000 through 2013. Among these men, 233 (51%) developed bone metastases during follow-up and represented the study cohort. First occurrence of an SRE was abstracted from the medical records. A stepwise multivariable Cox model was used to select the strongest predictors of time to SRE.  Results:   The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of bone mCRPC was 75 years (interquartile range, 68-81 years), and there were 153 nonblack patients (66%). During follow-up (median, 7.8 months [interquartile range, 2.9-18.3 months]), 88 patients (38%) had an SRE. On univariable analysis, more recent year of metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91), prostate-specific antigen doubling time of ≥9 months versus <9 months (HR, 0.50), and bone pain (HR, 3.34) were all found to be associated with SRE risk. On multivariable analysis, year of metastasis (HR, 0.93), biopsy Gleason score of 7 versus ≤6 (HR, 1.74), radiotherapy as the primary localized treatment versus none (HR, 2.33), and bone pain (HR, 3.64) were associated with SRE risk. The area under the curve for a multivariable model based upon these risk factors was 0.744.  Conclusions:   The authors identified several significant predictors of SREs among men with mCRPC. In particular, men with bone pain are at high risk of an SRE. If confirmed, future trials should focus on prolonging life and reducing SRE risk in patients with mCRPC with bone pain.

Materials and methods:   A total of 124 prostate MRI examinations classified as positive (n = 52; single Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] category 3 or higher lesion showing Gleason score ≥ 7 tumor at MRI-targeted biopsy) or negative (n = 72; PI-RADS category 2 or lower and negative biopsy) for detectable tumor were included. These were divided into four equal-sized batches, each with matching numbers of positive and negative examinations. Six second-year radiology residents reviewed examinations to localize tumors. Three of the six readers received feedback after each examination showing the preceding case's solution. The learning curve, plotting accuracy over time, was assessed by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Logistic regression and mixed-model ANOVA were performed.  Results:   For readers with and without feedback, the learning curve exhibited an initial rapid improvement that slowed after 40 examinations (change in AIC > 0.2%). Accuracy improved from 58.1% (batch 1) to 71.0-75.3% (batches 2-4) without feedback and from 58.1% to 72.0-77.4% with feedback (p = 0.027-0.046), without a difference in the extent of improvement (p = 0.800). Specificity improved from 53.7% to 68.5-81.5% without feedback and from 55.6% to 74.1-81.5% with feedback (p = 0.006-0.010), without a difference in the extent of improvement (p = 0.891).

Sensitivity for transition zone tumors exhibited larger changes (p = 0.024) with feedback than without feedback. Sensitivity for peripheral zone tumors did not improve in either group (p > 0.3).

Apoptosis was visualized by Ao/EtBr dual staining (20×), and protein expression of PCNA by immunocytochemistry was performed. Molecular docking was performed to understand the possible interaction between nimbolide and Akt, PCNA, and Cyclin D1. Nimbolide altered the PI3K-Akt-mediated cell survival and proliferative molecules. Thus, nimbolide exerted anticancer effects in vitro by representing the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in PC-3 cells.

For functional validation, AXL was either overexpressed or inhibited with BGB324 in HNSCC cell lines to assess proliferation, migration and invasion. We found AXL protein expression increasing during tumor progression with highest expression levels in recurrent tumors. In HNSCC cell lines in vitro, AXL overexpression increased migration as well as invasion. Both properties could be reduced through treatment with BGB324. In contrast, proliferation was neither affected by AXL overexpression nor by inhibition with BGB324.

Despite socioeconomic disparities with French mainland, all patients were treated within the French state-financed equal-access health care system. In this study, we report biochemical outcomes of patients treated by brachytherapy in our department from 2005 to 2014 in an African-Caribbean population.  Methods and materials:   Three hundred seventy consecutive patients receiving 125I brachytherapy as a curative treatment for early-stage (localized) disease between 2005 and 2014 were recorded. Selected patients presented with low-risk disease: initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/mL, clinical stage ≤ T2c, and Gleason score <7. Patients with intermediate risk of recurrence were also included on a case-to-case basis with prostate-specific antigen <15 or Gleason score 7 (3 + 4). Biochemical failure free-survival was defined according to the American Society for Radiation Oncology nadir+2 definition.  Results:   The 3-year and 5-year biochemical failure free-survival for the entire cohort were 98.3% and 91.6%, respectively. For patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease, the 5-year BBFS rates were 92.1% and 90.8%, respectively. In univariate and multivariate analyses, only Gleason score (<7 vs. 7; p = 0.030 vs. p < 0.05) was a significant predictor of biochemical failure.

Conclusions:   In this large single-center series, brachytherapy achieved excellent rates of medium-term biochemical control in both low and selected intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer in African-Caribbean patients.

Owing to shortcomings in the current treatments, other therapies are being considered. Toxic gene delivery is one of the most effective methods for cancer therapy. Cationic polymers are able to form stable nanoparticles via interaction with nucleic acids electrostatically. Branched polyethylenimine that contains amine groups has notable buffering capacity and the ability to escape from endosome through the proton sponge effect. However, the cytotoxicity of this polymer is high, and modification is one of the applicable strategies to overcome this problem. In this study, PEI was targeted with chlorotoxin (CTX) via N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) cross-linker. CTX can bind specifically to matrix metalloproteinase-2 that is overexpressed in certain cancers. Melittin as the major component of bee venom has been reported to have anti-cancer activity. This was thus selected to deliver to PC3 cell line. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that transfection efficiency of targeted nanoparticles is significantly higher compared to non-targeted nanoparticles. Targeted nanoparticles carrying the melittin gene also decreased cell viability of PC3 cells significantly while no toxic effects were observed on NIH3T3 cell line. Therefore, CTX-targeted nanoparticles carrying the melittin gene could serve as an appropriate gene delivery system for prostate and other MMP-2 positive cancer cells.""","""['Zahra Tarokh', 'Hossein Naderi-Manesh', 'Mahboobeh Nazari']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['Bee Venom Components as Therapeutic Tools against Prostate Cancer.', 'A ligand-mediated nanovector for targeted gene delivery and transfection in cancer cells.', 'Chlorotoxin labeled magnetic nanovectors for targeted gene delivery to glioma.', 'Progress in the development of lipopolyplexes as efficient non-viral gene delivery systems.', 'C- versus N-terminally linked melittin-polyethylenimine conjugates: the site of linkage strongly influences activity of DNA polyplexes.', 'An Updated Review Summarizing the Anticancer Efficacy of Melittin from Bee Venom in Several Models of Human Cancers.', 'Applications and evolution of melittin, the quintessential membrane active peptide.', 'Protease-triggered bioresponsive drug delivery for the targeted theranostics of malignancy.', 'Bee Venom Components as Therapeutic Tools against Prostate Cancer.', 'Strategies for Targeting Gene Therapy in Cancer Cells With Tumor-Specific Promoters.']"""

Materials and methods:   This prospective study was carried out over an 18month period. Our primary aim was to examine the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) as a predictor of toxicity in patients over 70years undergoing radical radiotherapy for any malignant diagnosis.  Results:   63 patients were recruited: 29% experienced grade 3 or greater toxicities, with very few having multiple grade 3 or greater toxicities. The majority of patients experienced multiple grade 1 or 2 toxicities. Patients were often admitted: either electively due to geographical reasons, or due to toxicities. All patients completed their courses of radiotherapy. All grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred within five radiotherapy sites; upper GI, gynaecological, lung, prostate and head & neck. There was no statistical correlation between EFS score and the presence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities.  Conclusion:   This study showed that neither EFS score, age nor ECOG performance status were predictive of radiotherapy toxicity, breaks in treatment or hospital admissions. Patients with oesophageal cancer, gynaecological cancers and lung cancer had a high rate of toxicity and hospital admission, which may highlight the need for additional patient support in these groups. Whilst comprehensive geriatric assessment is recommended, further research is needed to conclude if the frail elderly patient is at greater risk of toxicities from radiotherapy, and which geriatric assessment tool may be the most helpful.""","""['Lorna G Keenan', ""Michelle O'Brien"", 'Tim Ryan', 'Mary Dunne', 'Orla McArdle']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Re: Assessment of Older Patients with Cancer: Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) as a Predictor of Adverse Outcomes in Older Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy.', 'Edmonton Frail Scale predicts mortality in older patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy-A prospective observational study.', 'Preoperative frailty assessment with the Robinson Frailty Score, Edmonton Frail Scale, and G8 and adverse postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients with cancer.', 'Association of frailty with chemotherapy toxicity in chemotherapy-naive older patients with cancer.', 'Relationship Between Frailty and Fatigue in Older Cancer Patients.', 'Use of geriatric assessment and screening tools of frailty in elderly patients with prostate cancer.

The field of metabolomics has sought to identify these aberrant metabolites as disease biomarkers, clues to understanding disease mechanisms, or even as therapeutic agents.  Objective:   This study was undertaken to reliably predict metabolites associated with colorectal, esophageal, and prostate cancers. Metabolite and disease biological action networks were compared in a computational platform called MSD-MAP (Multi Scale Disease-Metabolite Association Platform).  Methods:   Using differential gene expression analysis with patient-based RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, genes up- or down-regulated in cancer compared to normal tissue were identified. Relational databases were used to map biological entities including pathways, functions, and interacting proteins, to those differential disease genes. Similar relational maps were built for metabolites, stemming from known and in silico predicted metabolite-protein associations. The hypergeometric test was used to find statistically significant relationships between disease and metabolite biological signatures at each tier, and metabolites were assessed for multi-scale association with each cancer. Metabolite networks were also directly associated with various other diseases using a disease functional perturbation database.  Results:   Our platform recapitulated metabolite-disease links that have been empirically verified in the scientific literature, with network-based mapping of jointly-associated biological activity also matching known disease mechanisms. This was true for colorectal, esophageal, and prostate cancers, using metabolite action networks stemming from both predicted and known functional protein associations.  Conclusion:   By employing systems biology concepts, MSD-MAP reliably predicted known cancermetabolite links, and may serve as a predictive tool to streamline conventional metabolomic profiling methodologies.""","""['Henri Wathieu', 'Naiem T Issa', 'Manisha Mohandoss', 'Stephen W Byers', 'Sivanesan Dakshanamurthy']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Comb Chem High Throughput Screen""","""['Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Automated pathway and reaction prediction facilitates in silico identification of unknown metabolites in human cohort studies.', 'Metabolomic network analysis of estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cells: a comparison of overrepresentation analysis, quantitative enrichment analysis and pathway analysis versus metabolite network analysis.', 'Data processing, multi-omic pathway mapping, and metabolite activity analysis using XCMS Online.', ""Single-platform 'multi-omic' profiling: unified mass spectrometry and computational workflows for integrative proteomics-metabolomics analysis.""]"""

Many forms of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) still rely on the AR for survival. Currently used antiandrogens face clinical limitations as drug resistance develops in patients over time since they all target the mutation-prone androgen binding site (ABS), where gain-of-function mutations eventually convert antagonists into agonists. With a significant number of reported distinct mutations located across the ABS, it is imperative to develop a prognostic platform which would equip clinicians with prior knowledge and actionable strategies if cases of previously unreported AR mutations are encountered. The goal of this study is to develop a theoretical approach that can predict such previously unreported AR mutants in response to current treatment options for PCa. The expected drug response by these mutants has been modeled using cheminformatics methodology. The corresponding QSAR pipeline has been created, which extracts key protein-ligand interactions and quantifies them by 4D molecular descriptors. The developed models reported with an accuracy reaching 90% and enable prediction of activation of AR mutants by its native ligand as well as assess whether known antiandrogens will act on them as agonists or antagonists. As a result, a previously uncharacterized mutant, T878G, has been predicted to be activated by the latest antiandrogen enzalutamide, and the corresponding experimental evaluation confirmed this prediction. Overall, the developed cheminformatics pipeline provides useful insights toward understanding the changing genomic landscape of advanced PCa.""","""['Naman Paul', 'Lavinia A Carabet', 'Nada Lallous', 'Takeshi Yamazaki', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Artem Cherkasov']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Chem Inf Model""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of F877L mutant androgen receptor.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.', 'Cheminformatic Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling to Investigate Androgen Receptor Antagonists to Combat Prostate Cancer.', 'Computationally guided discovery of novel non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonists demonstrating potency against antiandrogen resistance.', 'Deep Learning Modeling of Androgen Receptor Responses to Prostate Cancer Therapies.', 'Combining Mutational Signatures, Clonal Fitness, and Drug Affinity to Define Drug-Specific Resistance Mutations in Cancer.']"""
