This implantable device enables noninvasive and continuous measurements of IFP. The Guyton chamber allows for an accurate measurement of IFP without the interference from various cellular/tissue components. The sensor consists of a coil, an air chamber, a silicone membrane embedded with a nickel plate, and a Guyton chamber. The fabricated device is 3 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness. The sensor shows a linear response to the pressure with a sensitivity of 60 kHz/mmHg and a resolution of 1 mmHg. Experiments in human prostate cancer tumors grown in mice confirm the sensor's capability to operate in vivo and provide continuous wireless measurement of IFP, a surrogate parameter indicating the ""window of opportunity"" for delivering chemo- and radio-therapeutic agents.""","""['Seung Hyun Song', 'Albert Kim', 'Marcus Brown', 'Chaeyong Jung', 'S Ko', 'Babak Ziaie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Preliminary study on implantable inductive-type sensor for continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure.', 'An Implantable RFID Sensor Tag toward Continuous Glucose Monitoring.', 'Microsystems technology in radiation therapy.', 'Prospcts of application of implantable microkelectromechanical systems for monitoring and analysis of parameters of blood circulation system.', 'Totally Implantable Wireless Ultrasonic Doppler Blood Flowmeters: Toward Accurate Miniaturized Chronic Monitors.', 'The interstitial compartment as a therapeutic target in heart failure.', 'Monitoring and modulation of the tumor microenvironment for enhanced cancer modeling.', 'Feasibility research of non-invasive methods for interstitial fluid level measurement.']"""

Patients and methods:   The risk of prostate cancer (PCa) and significant PCa (Gleason score ≥7) in 2001 patients from six tertiary referral centres was calculated according to the PCPT-RC and ERSPC-RC formulae. The calculators' predictions were analysed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, Hosmer-Lemeshow test for goodness of fit and decision-curve analysis. In a subset of 222 patients for whom the PHI score was available, each patient's risk was calculated as per the ERSPC-RC and ERSPC-PHI risk calculators.  Results:   The ERSPC-RC outperformed the PCPT-RC in the prediction of PCa, with an AUC of 0.71 compared with 0.64, and also outperformed the PCPT-RC in the prediction of significant PCa (P<0.001), with an AUC of 0.74 compared with 0.69. The ERSPC-RC was found to have improved calibration in this cohort and was associated with a greater net benefit on decision-curve analysis for both PCa and significant PCa. The performance of the ERSPC-RC was further improved through the addition of the PHI score in a subset of 222 patients. The AUCs of the ERSPC-PHI were 0.76 and 0.78 for PCa and significant PCa prediction, respectively, in comparison with AUC values of 0.72 in the prediction of both PCa and significant PCa for the ERSPC-RC (P = 0.12 and P = 0.04, respectively). The ERSPC-PHI risk calculator was well calibrated in this cohort and had an increase in net benefit over that of the ERSPC-RC.  Conclusions:   The performance of the risk calculators in the present cohort shows that the ERSPC-RC is a superior tool in the prediction of PCa; however the performance of the ERSPC-RC in this population does not yet warrant its use in clinical practice. The incorporation of the PHI score into the ERSPC-PHI risk calculator allowed each patient's risk to be more accurately quantified. Individual patient risk calculation using the ERSPC-PHI risk calculator can be undertaken in order to allow a systematic approach to patient risk stratification and to aid in the diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Robert W Foley', 'Robert M Maweni', 'Laura Gorman', 'Keefe Murphy', 'Dara J Lundon', 'Garrett Durkan', 'Richard Power', ""Frank O'Brien"", ""Kieran J O'Malley"", 'David J Galvin', 'T Brendan Murphy', 'R William Watson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate cancer risk calculators: still much work ahead.', 'Comparison of risk calculators from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer in a contemporary Canadian cohort.', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction using the novel versions of the European Randomised Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculators: independent validation and comparison in a contemporary European cohort.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer risk: the role of prostate volume and digital rectal examination in the ERSPC risk calculators.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

We performed a comparative phosphoproteome analysis using a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and an LNCaP-derived androgen-independent cell line, LNCaP-AI, to identify phosphoproteins involved in this mechanism. We performed quantitative comparisons of the phosphopeptide levels in tryptic digests of protein extracts from these cell lines using MS. We found that the levels of 69 phosphopeptides in 66 proteins significantly differed between LNCaP and LNCaP-AI. In particular, we focused on thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 3 (THRAP3), which is a known transcriptional coactivator of the androgen receptor. The phosphorylation level of THRAP3 was significantly lower at S248 and S253 in LNCaP-AI cells. Furthermore, pull-down assays showed that 32 proteins uniquely bound to the nonphosphorylatable mutant form of THRAP3, whereas 31 other proteins uniquely bound to the phosphorylation-mimic form. Many of the differentially interacting proteins were identified as being involved with RNA splicing and processing. These results suggest that the phosphorylation state of THRAP3 at S248 and S253 might be involved in the mechanism of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth by changing the interaction partners.""","""['Yoko Ino', 'Noriaki Arakawa', 'Hitoshi Ishiguro', 'Hiroji Uemura', 'Yoshinobu Kubota', 'Hisashi Hirano', 'Tosifusa Toda']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proteomics""","""['Differential phosphoprotein levels and pathway analysis identify the transition mechanism of LNCaP cells into androgen-independent cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and vitamin D receptor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'The progression of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to androgen independence involves decreased FOXO3a expression and reduced p27KIP1 promoter transactivation.', 'Toward a global characterization of the phosphoproteome in prostate cancer cells: identification of phosphoproteins in the LNCaP cell line.', 'Deciphering the Clinical Significance and Kinase Functions of GSK3α in Colon Cancer by Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Phosphopeptide enrichment using Phos-tag technology reveals functional phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2.', 'Inhibition of a Novel CLK1-THRAP3-PPARγ Axis Improves Insulin Sensitivity.', 'The MYH9 Cytoskeletal Protein Is a Novel Corepressor of Androgen Receptors.']"""

The purpose of the present study was to determine if AMPA could inhibit growth and metastasis of prostate cancer in vivo. Human prostate cancer PC-3-LacZ-luciferase cells were implanted into the ventral lateral lobes of the prostate in 39 athymic Nu/Nu nude male mice. Seven days later, mice were randomized into the control group (n = 14, treated intraperitoneally with phosphate buffered saline), low dose group (n = 10, treated intraperitoneally with AMPA at 400 mg/kg body weight/day), and high dose group (n = 15, treated intraperitoneally with AMPA at 800 mg/kg body weight/day). Tumor growth and metastasis were examined every 4-7 days by bioluminescence imaging of live mice. We found that AMPA treatment significantly inhibited growth and metastasis of orthotopic xenograft prostate tumors and prolonged the survival time of the mice. AMPA treatment decreased expression of BIRC2 and activated caspase 3, leading to increased apoptosis in the prostate tumors. AMPA treatment decreased expression of cyclin D1. AMPA treatment also reduced angiogenesis in the prostate tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AMPA can inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis, suggesting that AMPA may be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Keshab Raj Parajuli', 'Qiuyang Zhang', 'Sen Liu', 'Zongbing You']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Plumbagin, a medicinal plant (Plumbago zeylanica)-derived 1,4-naphthoquinone, inhibits growth and metastasis of human prostate cancer PC-3M-luciferase cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model.', 'Alendronate decreases orthotopic PC-3 prostate tumor growth and metastasis to prostate-draining lymph nodes in nude mice.', 'Aminomethylphosphonic acid and methoxyacetic acid induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Dietary Compounds for Targeting Prostate Cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid (AMPA) Modulate Glutathione S-Transferase in Non-Tumorigenic Prostate Cells.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Biofunctionalization of Textile Materials. 2.

Current research on tumour-related extracellular vesicles (EVs) suggests that exosomes play a significant role in paracrine signaling pathways, thus potentially influencing cancer progression via multiple mechanisms. In fact, during the last decade numerous studies have revealed the role of EVs in the progression of various pathological conditions including cancer. Moreover, differences in the proteomic, lipidomic, and cholesterol content of exosomes derived from PCa cell lines versus benign prostate cell lines confirm that exosomes could be excellent biomarker candidates. As such, as part of an extensive proteomic analysis using LCMS we previously described a potential role of exosomes as biomarkers for PCa. Current evidence suggests that uptake of EV's into the local tumour microenvironment encouraging us to further examine the role of these vesicles in distinct mechanisms involved in the progression of PCa and castration resistant PCa. For the purpose of this study, we hypothesized that exosomes play a pivotal role in cell-cell communication in the local tumour microenvironment, conferring activation of numerous survival mechanisms during PCa progression and development of therapeutic resistance. Our in vitro results demonstrate that PCa derived exosomes significantly reduce apoptosis, increase cancer cell proliferation and induce cell migration in LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells. In conjunction with our in vitro findings, we have also demonstrated that exosomes increased tumor volume and serum PSA levels in vivo when xenograft bearing mice were administered DU145 cell derived exosomes intravenously.

We investigated the use of the pan-αv integrin inhibitor abituzumab in chemotherapy-naïve patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   PERSEUS (NCT01360840) was a randomized, double-blind phase II study. Men with pathologically confirmed prostate cancer and radiologic progression of bone lesions in the 28 days prior to randomization were assigned to receive abituzumab 750 mg or 1,500 mg or placebo (1:1:1) every 3 weeks in combination with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   The intent-to-treat population comprised 180 patients, 60 in each arm. The primary endpoint of PFS was not significantly different with abituzumab-based therapy compared with placebo [abituzumab 750 mg, 3.4 months, HR = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-1.39; abituzumab 1,500 mg, 4.3 months, HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.52-1.26; placebo, 3.3 months], but the cumulative incidence of bone lesion progression was lower with abituzumab than with placebo for up to 24 months (cumulative incidence 23.6% vs. 41.1% at 6 months, 26.1% vs. 45.4% at 12 months). Two partial tumor responses were observed (1 abituzumab 1,500 mg and 1 placebo). Approximately 85% to 90% of patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the different arms, but the incidences of serious TEAEs and TEAEs with fatal outcome were similar in the three arms.

It can present alone or in association with various rheumatic or malignant diseases.  Case report:   An 83-year-old man presented with anemia, hyper-sedimentation, and pitting edema of the back of the hands. The patient complained of pain and stiffness of the shoulder and hip girdles, especially in the morning. He was previously diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. After 3 years of watchful waiting, treatment with goserelin, a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist, was started, when PSA had increased to 67.9 µg/l. About 1 year before the cancer treatment, the patient also presented with sore and swollen hands, compatible with RS3PE, which remitted after a few months of prostatic cancer treatment. Thorough laboratory evaluation was performed upon admission to the Rheumatology Department and he was referred for FDG PET/CT on suspicion of metastases of the previously diagnosed prostatic cancer. PET/CT imaging revealed increased FDG uptake in the soft tissues around the shoulders and hips, but no evidence of bone metastasis or other malignant findings. A diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) together with RS3PE syndrome was made and treatment with prednisolone 15 mg/d was started, which resulted in rapid resolution of the symptoms.  Conclusions:   Presence of RS3PE in relation with PMR and prostatic cancer in our patient suggests a common trigger factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of RS3PE that presented twice with 2 different diagnoses in the same patient.""","""['Amir Emamifar', 'Soeren Hess', 'Rannveig Gildberg-Mortensen', 'Inger Marie Jensen Hansen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""['Polymyalgia rheumatica and remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema following intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin.', 'Idiopathic remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema syndrome mimicking symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica: a case report.', 'Clinical characteristics of patients with remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema compared to patients with pure polymyalgia rheumatica.', 'Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema (RS3PE) syndrome: a prospective follow up and magnetic resonance imaging study.', 'Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome: a review of the literature and a report of three cases.', 'Case Report: Syndrome of Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema-A Rare but Treatable Condition in Palliative Medicine.', 'A Case of Localized Prostate Cancer Associated with Polymyalgia Rheumatica with Marked Symptomatic Improvement after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) with painful erythematous nodules.', 'Polymyalgia rheumatica and remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema following intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin.', 'A Case of Polymyalgia Rheumatica Following Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for High-Grade Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the investigations about CXCL3/CXCR2 axis in prostate cancer have been poorly involved. Herein we firstly reported our studies on the expression and biological roles of CXCL3 and CXCR2 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Expression levels of CXCL3 and CXCR2 in prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP), immortalized prostate stromal cell line (WPMY-1) and immortalized prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) were investigated by RT-PCR, ELISA and western blot, whereas expression levels of CXCL3 in a prostate tissue microarray were detected by immunohistochemistry. Cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays were, respectively, utilized to determine the effects of exogenous CXCL3 on the cell proliferation and migration. We further examined whether CXCL3 could regulate the expression of genes correlated with prostate tumorigenesis by RT- PCR.  Results:   Elevated expression of CXCR2 was detected in DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1. Moreover, high-level CXCL3 can be secreted by PC-3 and RWPE-1, and CXCL3 protein expression level in tissue microarray is concordant with prostate cancer metastasis. Exogenous CXCL3 does not contribute to proliferation, but has a significant effect on migration of prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1. Finally, our data showed that exogenous CXCL3 can regulate the expression of genes including ERK, TP73, NUMB, BAX and NDRG3.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that CXCL3 and its receptor CXCR2 are overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer tissues, which may play multiple roles in prostate cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Shi-Liang Gui', 'Li-Chen Teng', 'Shu-Qiu Wang', 'Shuang Liu', 'Ying-Li Lin', 'Xiao-Lian Zhao', 'Lei Liu', 'Hong-Yu Sui', 'Yang Yang', 'Li-Chun Liang', 'Mo-Lin Wang', 'Xin-Yi Li', 'Yu Cao', 'Feng-Ying Li', 'Wei-Qun Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Chemokine CXCL3 mediates prostate cancer cells proliferation, migration and gene expression changes in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.', 'CXCL3 overexpression promotes the tumorigenic potential of uterine cervical cancer cells via the MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'CXCL16 functions as a novel chemotactic factor for prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'NDRG3 is an androgen regulated and prostate enriched gene that promotes in vitro and in vivo prostate cancer cell growth.', 'CXCL3 Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Anti-inflammatory effect of green photobiomodulation in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Solamargine Alleviates Proliferation and Metastasis of Cervical Cancer Cells by Blocking the CXCL3-Mediated Erk Signaling Pathway.', 'Siglec-15 as a New Perspective Therapy Target in Human Giant Cell Tumor of Bone.', 'In Prostate Cancer Cells Cytokines Are Early Responders to Gravitational Changes Occurring in Parabolic Flights.', 'Inhibitory effect of lingonberry extract on HepG2 cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.']"""

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated as a secreted factor that alters the bone microenvironment. Proteolytic cleavage of Gal-3 may also contribute to malignant cellular behaviors, but has not been addressed in cancer metastasis. Here, we report that Gal-3 modulates the osteolytic bone tumor microenvironment in the presence of RANKL. Gal-3 was localized on the osteoclast cell surface, and its suppression by RNAi or a specific antagonist markedly inhibited osteoclast differentiation markers, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and reduced the number of mature osteoclasts. Structurally, the 158-175 amino acid sequence in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of Gal-3 was responsible for augmented osteoclastogenesis. During osteoclast maturation, Gal-3 interacted and colocalized with myosin-2A along the surface of cell-cell fusion. Pathologically, bone metastatic cancers expressed and released an intact form of Gal-3, mainly detected in breast cancer bone metastases, as well as a cleaved form, more abundant in prostate cancer bone metastases. Secreted intact Gal-3 interacted with myosin-2A, leading to osteoclastogenesis, whereas a shift to cleaved Gal-3 attenuated the enhancement in osteoclast differentiation. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Gal-3 shapes the bone tumor microenvironment through distinct roles contingent on its cleavage status, and highlight Gal-3 targeting through the CRD as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating osteolytic bone remodeling in the metastatic niche.""","""['Kosei Nakajima', 'Dhong Hyo Kho', 'Takashi Yanagawa', 'Yosuke Harazono', 'Victor Hogan', 'Wei Chen', 'Rouba Ali-Fehmi', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Avraham Raz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) is a key molecule of osteoclast formation for bone metastasis in a newly developed model of human neuroblastoma.', 'Expression of osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand in breast cancer bone metastasis.', 'MMP-13 stimulates osteoclast differentiation and activation in tumour breast bone metastases.', 'Breast cancer metastasis to the bone: mechanisms of bone loss.', 'Galectin-3 in bone tumor microenvironment: a beacon for individual skeletal metastasis management.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Galectins as pivotal components in oncogenesis and immune exclusion in human malignancies.', 'Targeting galectin-driven regulatory circuits in cancer and fibrosis.', 'Galectin-3 in prostate cancer and heart diseases: a biomarker for these two frightening pathologies?', 'Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.']"""

Emetine is a highly cytotoxic natural product protein synthesis inhibitor, which is toxic to all cell types. Its cytotoxicity can be blocked by derivatizing its N-2' position. Thus emetine can be selectively delivered to cancer cells in the region of metastatic cancer as a prodrug that will be activated by an enzyme selectively overexpressed within the metastatic tumor microenvironment. In this work, we convert emetine to a prodrug activatable by the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a serine protease overexpressed by the carcinoma associated fibroblasts.  Method:   By using an iterative structure-activity relationship strategy, several peptidyl emetine prodrug analogs (1-11) were synthesized by chemical derivatization of emetine at its N-2' position and tested for in-vitro activation by FAP. The lead prodrug 11 is made up of a DPPIV activatable prodrug precursor 10 (Ala-Pro-PABC-Emetine) coupled to FAP substrate (Ala-Ser-Gly-Pro-Ala-Gly-Pro). Activation assays of the prodrugs were performed in purified FAP, DPPIV, FBS, and human serum and were analyzed by LCMS. In vitro cytotoxicity assays of these prodrugs are carried out in prostate (LNCaP, PC3) and breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines. The prodrugs are also tested in normal immortalized human prostatic epithelial cell line (PrEC).  Results:   The lead FAP activated emetine prodrug 11 is activated to emetine in tandem by FAP and DPPIV in about 70% conversion within 24 hr. In prostate and breast cancer cell lines treated with prodrug 11, it is found to be equipotent with emetine in the presence of FAP and DPPIV. However, in the PrEC cell line grown in serum free media, prodrug 11 is more than 200-fold less cytotoxic than emetine in the absence of FAP and DPPIV.  Conclusion:   This FAP activated prodrug of cytotoxic agent emetine further shows the crucial role of the N-2' position of emetine in controlling its cytotoxicity. Significantly reduced toxicity observed in the PrEC cell line in the absence of FAP and DPPIV shows that prodrug 11 could be systemically delivered to regions of metastatic prostate cancer or other solid tumor for activation by cancer selective enzymes within the cancer microenvironment, such as FAP that is overexpressed by the carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. The two-step tandem enzymatic activation of prodrug 11 by FAP and DPPIV is a strategy for overcoming steric hindrance.""","""['Emmanuel S Akinboye', 'W Nathaniel Brennen', 'D Marc Rosen', 'Oladapo Bakare', 'Samuel R Denmeade']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Targeting carcinoma-associated fibroblasts within the tumor stroma with a fibroblast activation protein-activated prodrug.', 'Pharmacokinetics and toxicology of a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-activated prodrug in murine xenograft models of human cancer.', 'Anticancer activities of emetine prodrugs that are proteolytically activated by the prostate specific antigen (PSA) and evaluation of in vivo toxicity of emetine derivatives.', 'Molecular recognition of fibroblast activation protein for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.', 'Rationale behind targeting fibroblast activation protein-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts as a novel chemotherapeutic strategy.', 'Drug Delivery Strategies for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.', ""Different Aspects of Emetine's Capabilities as a Highly Potent SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitor against COVID-19."", 'Validating Cell Surface Proteases as Drug Targets for Cancer Therapy: What Do We Know, and Where Do We Go?', 'Fibroblast Activation Protein-α as a Target in the Bench-to-Bedside Diagnosis and Treatment of Tumors: A Narrative Review.', 'Overcoming stromal barriers to immuno-oncological responses via fibroblast activation protein-targeted therapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   Forty patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer were enrolled on a prospective clinical trial approved by our institution's research ethics board. Multiparametric MRI with stereotactic navigation was used to guide insertion of brachytherapy catheters, followed by MRI-based treatment planning.  Results:   Sixty-two implants were performed. Median catheter insertion + imaging time was 100 minutes, and overall anesthesia time was 4.0 hours (range, 2.1-6.9 hours). MRI at the time of brachytherapy restaged 14 patients (35%) who were found to have a higher stage of disease. In 6 patients, this translated in directed insertion of brachytherapy catheters outside the prostate boundary (extracapsular disease [n = 2] or seminal vesicle invasion [n = 4]). Most patients (80%) had gross tumor visible on MRI, which influenced catheter insertion and treatment planning. MRI depicted postimplant anatomic boundaries clearly, with the exception of the apical prostate which was blurred by trauma after catheter insertion. Conventional dose-planning objectives for the rectum (V75 < 1.0 cc) were difficult to achieve, but toxicities were low (acute grade ≥ 2 genitourinary = 20%, late grade ≥ 2 genitourinary = 15%, and late grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal = 7%).

Sagittally reconstructed 3D (SR3D) transrectal ultrasound enables both organ and needle segmentation and has the potential to reduce organ-needle alignment uncertainty. This study compares the accuracy of needle tip localization between the conventional 2D sagittally assisted axially reconstructed (SAAR) and SR3D approaches.  Methods and materials:   Twelve patients underwent SAAR-guided HDR-BT, during which SR3D images were acquired for subsequent segmentation and analysis. A total of 183 needles were investigated. Needle end-length measurements were taken, providing a gold standard for insertion depths. Dosimetric impact of insertion depth errors (IDEs) on clinical treatment plans was assessed.  Results:   SR3D guidance provided statistically significantly smaller IDEs than SAAR guidance with a mean ± SD of -0.6 ± 3.2 mm and 2.8 ± 3.2 mm, respectively (p < 0.001). Shadow artifacts were found to obstruct the view of some needle tips in SR3D images either partially (12%) or fully (10%); however, SR3D IDEs had a statistically significantly smaller impact on prostate V100% than SAAR IDEs with mean ± SD decreases of -1.2 ± 1.3% and -6.5 ± 6.7%, respectively (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   SR3D-guided HDR-BT eliminates a source of systematic uncertainty from the SAAR-guided approach, providing decreased IDEs for most needles, leading to a significant decrease in dosimetric uncertainty. Although imaging artifacts can limit the accuracy of tip localization in a subset of needles, we identified a method to mitigate these artifacts for clinical implementation.""","""['William Thomas Hrinivich', 'Douglas A Hoover', 'Kathleen Surry', 'Chandima Edirisinghe', 'Jacques Montreuil', ""David D'Souza"", 'Aaron Fenster', 'Eugene Wong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Accuracy and variability of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy needle tip localization using live two-dimensional and sagittally reconstructed three-dimensional ultrasound.', 'Simultaneous automatic segmentation of multiple needles using 3D ultrasound for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'A power Doppler ultrasound method for improving intraoperative tip localization for visually obstructed needles in interstitial prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Place of modern imaging in brachytherapy planning.', 'Concordance of Gleason grading with three-dimensional ultrasound systematic biopsy and biopsy core pre-embedding.']"""

We investigated whether those disparities have changed over time.  Methods:   We used population-based cancer registry data for 377,493 patients diagnosed with one of 10 major cancers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Patients were assigned to an area-based measure of socioeconomic status. Five-year relative survival was estimated for each socioeconomic quintile in each 'at risk' period (1996-2000 and 2004-2008) for the 10 individual cancers. Poisson-regression modelling was used to adjust for several prognostic factors. The relative excess risk of death by socioeconomic quintile derived from this modelling was compared over time.  Results:   Although survival increased over time for most individual cancers, Poisson-regression models indicated that socioeconomic disparities continued to exist in the recent period. Significant socioeconomic disparities were observed for stomach, colorectal, liver, lung, breast and prostate cancer in 1996-2000 and remained so for 2004-2008, while significant disparities emerged for cervical and uterus cancer in 2004-2008 (although the interaction between period and socioeconomic status was not significant). About 13.4% of deaths attributable to a diagnosis of cancer could have been postponed if this socioeconomic disparity was eliminated.

Recently, in the course of our screening for a novel anticancer compound, we synthesized carbocyclic analogs of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleoside; compounds 5, and 6. In the current study, we report the effects of compound 5 on pleiotropic induction of cell death via up-regulation of AR-associated p21(Cip1) protein in prostate cancer cells with different androgen responsiveness, such as LNCaP (androgen-dependent and -sensitive), LNCaP(C4-2) (androgen-independent and -sensitive; androgen-refractory), and DU145 (androgen-independent and -insensitive) cells. The treatment of LNCaP cells with 6 μM compound 5 for 24 h stimulated the androgen receptor (AR) activity and dramatically up-regulated transcription (56-fold) of p21(Cip1), which, in turn, induces typical apoptosis in the cells. However, induction of apoptosis through up-regulation (23-fold) of AR-associated p21(Cip1) achieved in LNCaP(C4-2) cells was possible by intensive cell treatment with compound 5 (9 μM, 48 h), because the cells are less sensitive and independent to androgen than LNCaP cells. Furthermore, 6 μM compound 5-treated DU145 cells, which exhibit extremely low AR activation due to no androgen responsiveness and dependency, showed neither up-regulation of p21(Cip1) nor apoptotic induction. Instead, a different type of cell death, autophagy-like death through the LC3B-associated autophagosome formation, was obviously induced in DU145 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that pleiotropic induction of prostate cancer cell death by compound 5 is determined by how efficiently and how abundantly androgen-dependent activation of the AR occurs, whereas compound 6 shows no induction of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.""","""['Hyewon Suh', 'Ko-woon Choi', 'Jongbok Lee', 'Chongsuk Ryou', 'Hakjune Rhee', 'Chul-Hoon Lee']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['p21CIP1 Induces Apoptosis via Binding to BCL2 in LNCaP Prostate Cancer Cells Treated with MCS-C3, A Novel Carbocyclic Analog of Pyrrolopyrimidine.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Benzyldihydroxyoctenone, a novel nonsteroidal antiandrogen, shows differential apoptotic induction in prostate cancer cells in response to their androgen responsiveness.', 'A novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MHY219\xa0induces apoptosis via up-regulation of androgen receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'ROCK mediates phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via p21Cip1 up-regulation and JNK.', 'New Derivatives of 5-Substituted Uracils: Potential Agents with a Wide Spectrum of Biological Activity.', ""An Expeditious Total Synthesis of 5'-Deoxy-toyocamycin and 5'-Deoxysangivamycin.""]"""

Because glycolysis is a feature of malignancy and the degree of glycolysis generally correlates with tumor aggressiveness, we wanted to compare the metabolic differences and the molecular mechanisms involved between the two tumor types. In this study, and based on previous characterization, LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines were selected as models of prostatic adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, respectively. In addition to measuring glucose consumption, lactate secretion, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, we performed metabolic profiling in these two model systems. The role of CD44 was studied by RNAi and lentivirus-mediated overexpression. Expression of key enzymes in glycolysis was studied using human tissue microarrays containing benign prostate, adenocarcinoma, and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Results showed that glycolytic features of PC-3 cells were higher than that of LNCaP cells. PFKFB4 was overexpressed in human small cell carcinoma tissue versus adenocarcinoma tissue. CD44 regulated glucose metabolism, intracellular ROS, and cell proliferation in PC-3 cells. Inhibition of CD44 also sensitized PC-3 cells to carboplatin. In conclusion, this study suggests different pathways of glucose metabolism contribute to the disparate biologic behaviors of these two tumor types.

Real-time PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were applied to study the expression of candidate biomarkers. ccRCC cell lines were treated with sertraline to inhibit the dopamine transporter SLC6A3.  Results:   Differential expression of fourteen mRNAs, yet not studied in ccRCC in depth, was confirmed using qPCR (upregulation: SLC6A3, NPTX2, TNFAIP6, NDUFA4L2, ENPP3, FABP6, SPINK13; downregulation: FXYD4, SLC12A1, KNG1, NPHS2, SLC13A3, GCGR, PLG). Up-/downregulation was also confirmed for FXYD4, KNG1, NPTX2 and SLC12A1 by Western Blot on the protein level. In contrast to the mRNA expression, protein expression of the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 was lower in ccRCC compared to normal renal tissue. Immunohistochemistry indicated that this decrease was due to higher concentrations of SLC6A3 in the proximal tubules. Immunohistochemical analyses further demonstrated that high SLC6A3 expression in ccRCC tissue was correlated with a shorter period of recurrence-free survival following surgery.

Radiation is typically given with androgen suppression when testosterone levels are at their nadir. Recent reports have shown that androgen stimulation of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells leads to formation of double-strand breaks (DSB). Here, we exploit this finding and investigate the extent and timing of androgen-induced DSBs and their effect on tumor growth following androgen stimulation in combination with ionizing radiation (IR).  Experimental design:   Androgen-induced DNA damage was assessed by comet assays and γH2A.X foci formation. Effects of androgen stimulation and radiation were determined in vitro and in vivo with xenograft models.  Results:   We document that androgen treatment of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cell lines resulted in a dose- and time-dependent induction of widespread DSBs. Generation of these breaks was dependent on androgen receptor and topoisomerase II beta but not on cell-cycle progression. In vitro models demonstrated a synergistic interaction between IR and androgen stimulation when IR is given at a time point corresponding with high levels of androgen-induced DSB formation. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed a significant improvement in tumor growth delay when radiation was given shortly after androgen repletion in castrated mice.  Conclusions:   These results suggest a potential cooperative effect and improved tumor growth delay with androgen-induced DSBs and radiation with implications for improving the therapeutic index of prostate cancer radiation therapy.

The definition of failure of classical hormonal therapy has been based on the guidelines of the German Society of Urology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Urologie, DGU) and the European Association of Urology (EAU). Criteria for the initiation of treatment with hormonal or chemotherapy include: Castration resistance with increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Evidence of metastases in imaging No or mild symptoms Quality of Life Index of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1 (ECOG 2 requires individualized decision) [1].

The first aim of this study was to psychometrically test the PHQ-9 in a large sample of cancer patients. The second aim was to calculate unbiased estimates of the depression burden for several cancer groups taking into account age and gender distributions.  Methods:   A sample of 2,059 cancer patients with varying diagnoses were examined in this study six months after discharge from a rehabilitation clinic. A representative sample of 2,693 people from the general population served as controls. Expected PHQ-9 mean scores of the general population sample, regressed on age and gender, were calculated to enable a fair comparison of different groups of cancer patients.  Results:   While the reliability (Cronbach's alpha) for the PHQ-9 scale was good (alpha ≥ 0.84), the CFA fit indices of the one-dimensional solution were unsatisfactory in the patients' sample. The factorial analysis confirmed two factors. PHQ-9 mean scores for 15 types of cancer are given, ranging from 4.0 (prostate) to 8.2 (thyroid gland). Differences between expected mean scores (derived from the general population) and raw mean scores of the cancer subsamples are reported that provide a better estimate of the depression burden.  Conclusions:   The results confirmed that the PHQ-9 performs well in testing depression in cancer patients. Regression coefficients can be used for performing unbiased comparisons among cancer groups, not only for this study. The burden of patients with testis cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma is underestimated when age and gender are not taken into account.""","""['Andreas Hinz', 'Anja Mehnert', 'Rüya-Daniela Kocalevent', 'Elmar Brähler', 'Thomas Forkmann', 'Susanne Singer', 'Thomas Schulte']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Psychiatry""","""['Dimensional assessment of depressive severity in the elderly general population: psychometric evaluation of the PHQ-9 using Rasch Analysis.', 'Psychometric comparison of the PHQ-9 and BDI-II for measuring response during treatment of depression.', 'Comparison of the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for screening depression in older adults.', 'Reliability and validity of the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen for medical patients in the general German population.', 'A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression.', 'Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life among guardians of hospitalized psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a network perspective.', 'Impact of facilitating continued accessibility to cancer care during COVID-19 lockdown on perceived wellbeing of cancer patients at a rural cancer center in Rwanda.', 'Can self-compassion help us better understand the impact of pulmonary hypertension on those with the condition and their carers?

This analysis included men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between enrollment in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort in 1992 or 1993 and June 2011.

Our work addresses three goals, which align with the directive of the European Union's Realizing the European Network of Biodosimetry project (EU-RENB): 1. To examine the suitability of different gene expression platforms for biodosimetry purposes; 2. To perform this examination using blood samples collected from prostate cancer patients (in vivo) and from healthy donors (in vitro); and 3. To compare radiation-induced gene expression changes of the in vivo with in vitro blood samples. For the in vitro part of this study, EDTA-treated whole blood was irradiated immediately after venipuncture using single X-ray doses (1 Gy/min(-1) dose rate, 100 keV). Blood samples used to generate calibration curves as well as 10 coded (blinded) samples (0-4 Gy dose range) were incubated for 24 h in vitro, lysed and shipped on wet ice. For the in vivo part of the study PAXgene tubes were used and peripheral blood (2.5 ml) was collected from prostate cancer patients before and 24 h after the first fractionated 2 Gy dose of localized radiotherapy to the pelvis [linear accelerator (LINAC), 580 MU/min, exposure 1-1.5 min]. Assays were run in each laboratory according to locally established protocols using either microarray platforms (2 laboratories) or qRT-PCR (2 laboratories). Report times on dose estimates were documented. The mean absolute difference of estimated doses relative to the true doses (Gy) were calculated. Doses were also merged into binary categories reflecting aspects of clinical/diagnostic relevance. For the in vitro part of the study, the earliest report time on dose estimates was 7 h for qRT-PCR and 35 h for microarrays. Methodological variance of gene expression measurements (CV ≤10% for technical replicates) and interindividual variance (≤twofold for all genes) were low. Dose estimates based on one gene, ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), using qRT-PCR were as precise as dose estimates based on multiple genes using microarrays, but the precision decreased at doses ≥2 Gy. Binary dose categories comprising, for example, unexposed compared with exposed samples, could be completely discriminated with most of our methods. Exposed prostate cancer blood samples (n = 4) could be completely discriminated from unexposed blood samples (n = 4, P < 0.03, two-sided Fisher's exact test) without individual controls. This could be performed by introducing an in vitro-to-in vivo correction factor of FDXR, which varied among the laboratories. After that the in vitro-constructed calibration curves could be used for dose estimation of the in vivo exposed prostate cancer blood samples within an accuracy window of ±0.5 Gy in both contributing qRT-PCR laboratories. In conclusion, early and precise dose estimates can be performed, in particular at doses ≤2 Gy in vitro. Blood samples of prostate cancer patients exposed to 0.09-0.017 Gy could be completely discriminated from pre-exposure blood samples with the doses successfully estimated using adjusted in vitro-constructed calibration curves.""","""['M Abend', 'C Badie', 'R Quintens', 'R Kriehuber', 'G Manning', 'E Macaeva', 'M Njima', 'D Oskamp', 'S Strunz', 'S Moertl', 'S Doucha-Senf', 'S Dahlke', 'J Menzel', 'M Port']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['RENEB Inter-Laboratory Comparison 2021: The Gene Expression Assay.', 'Laboratory intercomparison of gene expression assays.', 'Inter-laboratory comparison of gene expression biodosimetry for protracted radiation exposures as part of the RENEB and EURADOS WG10 2019 exercise.', 'Usefulness and limits of biological dosimetry based on cytogenetic methods.', 'Advances in in vivo EPR Tooth BIOdosimetry: Meeting the targets for initial triage following a large-scale radiation event.', 'Identification of radiation responsive RBC membrane associated proteins (RMAPs) in whole-body γ-irradiated New Zealand white rabbits.', 'A Review of Radiation-Induced Alterations of Multi-Omic Profiles, Radiation Injury Biomarkers, and Countermeasures.', 'Identifying radiation responsive exon-regions of genes often used for biodosimetry and acute radiation syndrome prediction.', 'High-LET Carbon and Iron Ions Elicit a Prolonged and Amplified p53 Signaling and Inflammatory Response Compared to low-LET X-Rays in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.', 'Peripheral Blood Transcript Signatures after Internal 131I-mIBG Therapy in Relapsed and Refractory Neuroblastoma Patients Identifies Early and Late Biomarkers of Internal 131I Exposures.']"""

We thus examined the relationship between cabazitaxel-induced grade ≥3 neutropenia, baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and treatment outcomes.  Methods:   Data from the experimental arm of the TROPIC phase 3 trial which randomly assigned men with mCRPC to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone every 3 weeks, both combined with daily prednisone, were analysed. The influence on OS (primary end-point) and progression-free survival (PFS) of at least one episode of grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy was investigated using Cox regression models, adjusted for pain at baseline. The relationships with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses during cabazitaxel therapy and baseline NLR were also analysed.  Findings:   The occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy was associated with a prolonged OS (median 16.3 versus 14.0 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.65 [0.43-0.97], p = 0.035), a twice longer PFS (median 5.3 versus 2.6 months, HR = 0.56 [0.40-0.79], p = 0.001) and a higher confirmed PSA response ≥50% (49.8% versus 24.4%, p = 0.005), as compared with patients who did not develop grade ≥3 neutropenia. Grade ≥3 neutropenia was more common in case of NLR <3 as compared with NLR ≥3 at baseline (88.8% versus 75.3%, p = 0.002). Combining low NLR at baseline and grade ≥3 neutropenia during therapy was associated with the longest OS (median 19.2 months) while high NLR at baseline and no grade ≥3 neutropenia was associated with a poor OS (median 12.9 months, HR 0.46 [0.28-0.76], p = 0.002). In the subgroup of neutropenic patients the median OS was 19.7 months in those treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 16 months on those without G-CSF support.  Interpretation:   This post-hoc analysis of TROPIC suggests that the occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia with cabazitaxel is associated with improved OS and PFS. Patients with a low NLR at baseline were more likely to develop grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy and showed the longest OS. High NLR at baseline and no grade ≥3 neutropenia during therapy was associated with poor outcomes which may suggest insufficient drug exposure or a limited impact on the tumour-associated immune response. Primary or secondary prophylactic use of G-CSF had no adverse impact for outcome. If prospectively confirmed, these results would justify maintaining the intended cabazitaxel dose of 25 mg/m(2) whenever possible.""","""['Alexander Meisel', 'Stefanie von Felten', 'Deborah R Vogt', 'Heike Liewen', 'Ronald de Wit', 'Johann de Bono', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Frank Stenner-Liewen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Prednisone plus cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel treatment: a randomised open-label trial.', ""Weekly cabazitaxel plus prednisone is effective and less toxic for 'unfit' metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Phase II Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Group (SOGUG) trial."", 'Oncologic Response and Hospitalization Rate of Patients Receiving Cabazitaxel in the Fourth-Line and Beyond in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of a Retrospective Cohort and a Structured Literature Review.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

The objective of the current study was to assess lifetime costs and QALYs associated with contemporary PCa management strategies across risk groups by integrating localized and advanced disease.  Methods:   The authors' validated Markov chain Monte Carlo model was used to predict lifetime direct costs and QALYs. The health states modeled were active surveillance, initial treatments (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy), PCa recurrence, PCa recurrence free, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and death (cause specific/other causes). Data regarding treatment distribution, state transition probabilities, adverse effects of management options, costs, utilities, and disutilities were derived from the published literature.  Results:   The total cost per patient for the overall cohort increased from $18,503 at 5 years to $28,032 and $39,143, respectively, at 10 years and 15 years. Furthermore, the results indicated the influence of risk group on total cost, with the high-risk group accruing the maximum per patient cost followed by the intermediate-risk and low-risk groups. Active surveillance was found to confer the most QALYs (12.5 years) and was the least costly strategy ($18,452) for individuals at low risk. For all risk groups, radical prostatectomy was less costly and conferred modestly more QALYs compared with intensity-modulated radiotherapy modalities.

Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions associated with PCa in Chinese men are less studied. We explored the association between 36 SNPs and PCa in 574 subjects from northern China. Body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol consumption were determined through self-administered questionnaires in 134 PCa patients. Then gene-gene and gene-environment interactions among the PCa-associated SNPs were analyzed using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) and logistic regression methods. Allelic and genotypic association analyses showed that six variants were associated with PCa and the cumulative effect suggested men who carried any combination of 1, 2, or ≥3 risk genotypes had a gradually increased PCa risk (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.79-4.41). GMDR analysis identified the best gene-gene interaction model with scores of 10 for both the cross-validation consistency and sign tests. For gene-environment interactions, rs6983561 CC and rs16901966 GG in individuals with a BMI ≥ 28 had ORs of 7.66 (p = 0.032) and 5.33 (p = 0.046), respectively. rs7679673 CC + CA and rs12653946 TT in individuals that smoked had ORs of 2.77 (p = 0.007) and 3.11 (p = 0.024), respectively. rs7679673 CC in individuals that consumed alcohol had an OR of 4.37 (p = 0.041).

Methods:   Forty-one metastatic prostate cancer patients (43-89 years old; mean, 71 ± 9 years.) underwent fluoride PET/CT prior to 223Ra. Bone marrow failure was the primary end point and was defined as (1) development of hematologic toxicity (World Health Organization grade 3 or 4) associated with no recovery after 6 weeks or (2) death due to BMF after the last 223Ra dose. Bone marrow failure was correlated to fluoride PET/CT skeletal tumor burden (TLF10 [total lesion on fluoride PET/CT with SUVmax of 10 or greater]), use of chemotherapy, serum hemoglobin concentration, serum ALP, and serum prostate-specific antigen.  Results:   The number of 223Ra cycles ranged from 2 to 6 (mean, 5). Of the 41 patients, 16 developed BMF (G3 = 12; G4 = 4). A significantly increased risk of developing BMF was observed in patients with TLF10 of 12,000 or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 11.09; P < 0.0001), hemoglobin of less than 10 g/dL (HR, 7.35; P = 0.0002), and AP > 146 UI/L (HR, 4.52; P = 0.0100). Neither concomitant (HR, 0.91; P = 0.88) nor subsequent use of chemotherapy (HR, 0.14; P = 0.84) increased the risk of BMF, nor was prostate-specific antigen greater than 10 μg/L (HR, 0.90; P = 0.86). Moreover, in a multivariable analysis, TLF10 was the only independent predictor of BMF (HR, 6.66; P = 0.0237).  Conclusions:   223Ra was beneficial and reduced the risk of death even in patients with a high skeletal tumor burden.

Due to reported antitumor activity of amygdalin and growing popularity for complementary and alternative medicine the potential of this natural, widely used substance to exert antineoplastic effects on prostate cancer cells has been assessed.  Main methods:   LNCaP (castration-sensitive), DU-145 and PC3 cells (castration-resistant) were exposed to different concentrations of amygdalin for 24h or 2weeks. Cell growth was measured by the MTT test, clonal formation by the clonogenic assay. Flow cytometry served to investigate apoptosis and cell cycle phases. Cell cycle regulating proteins and the mTOR-akt signaling axis were analyzed by western blotting.  Key findings:   Amygdalin dose-dependently diminished tumor cell growth with maximum effects at 10mg/ml. Apoptosis of PC3 and LNCaP but not of DU-145 cells was reduced, whereas colony formation was suppressed in all cell lines. A decrease in the number of G2/M- and S-phase cells along with an elevated number of G0/G1-phase cells was recorded. The cell cycle proteins cdk 1, cdk 2 and cdk 4 as well as cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin D3 were modulated by amygdalin after both 24h and 2weeks. Distinct effects on p19 and p27 expression and on Akt, Rictor and Raptor activation became evident only after 2weeks.

Androgen receptor (AR) plays a core role in prostate cancer progression and is responsible for regulation of numerous downstream targets including microRNAs. This study identified an AR-repressed microRNA, miR-421, in prostate cancer. Expression of miR-421 was significantly suppressed by androgen treatment, and correlated to AR expression in different prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, androgen-activated AR could directly bind to androgen responsive element (ARE) of miR-421, as predicted by bioinformatics resources and demonstrated by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. In addition, over-expression of miR-421 markedly supressed cell viability, delayed cell cycle, reduced glycolysis and inhibited migration in prostate cancer cells. According to the result of miR-421 target genes searching, we focused on 4 genes NRAS, PRAME, CUL4B and PFKFB2 based on their involvement in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and metabolism. The expression of these 4 downstream targets were significantly repressed by miR-421, and the binding sites were verified by luciferase assay.

E3/E3 genotype carriers were 3.6-fold more likely to be patients than controls (odds ratio=3.67, 95% confidence interval=1.451-9.155; p=0.004). Additionally, the patients with E3/E3 genotype had significantly higher Gleason score (p=0.017), and more patients with this genotype had a Gleason score higher than 7 (p=0.007). Individuals carrying the E4 allele were significantly more common in the control group (p=0.006). The frequency of the E3/E4 genotype was found to be significantly higher in controls compared to patients (p=0.007), and patients were significantly less likely to have this genotype than controls (odds ratio=0.89, 95% confidence interval=0.833-0.967, p=0.007). Individuals carrying the E2/E3 genotype had a significantly lower Gleason score (p=0.049)-all of the patients with this genotype had a Gleason score lower than 7 (p=0.024).  Conclusion:   E3/E3 genotype may be a potential risk factor for prostate cancer and high Gleason scoring.

Inaccuracy of PSA is partly due to the influence of a number of genetic, clinical, and biological factors modifying PSA blood levels. In the present study, we detailed the respective influence of each factor among age, body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, and five single-nucleotide polymorphisms-rs10788160 (10q26), rs10993994 (10q11), rs11067228 (12q24), rs17632542 (19q13.33), and rs2928679 (8p21)-on PSA values in a cohort of 1374 men without PCa. Our results show that genetic factors, when risk variants are combined, influence PSA levels with an effect size similar to that of BMI. Taken together, the respective correlations of clinical parameters and genetic parameters would make it possible to correct and adjust PSA values more effectively in each individual. These results establish the basis to understand and implement a more personalised approach for the interpretation of PSA blood levels in the context of PCa screening and diagnosis.

The objective of the recommendations is to provide a schema for prostate cancer screening that maximizes the benefits, in terms of reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, and minimizes the harms, in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We recommend the following schema for men choosing to be screened following informed decision-making: starting at age 45, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without digital rectal examination. If PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL: consider prostate biopsy; if PSA ≥ 1 but < 3 ng/mL: return for PSA testing every 2-4 years; if PSA < 1 ng/mL: return for PSA testing at 6-10 years. PSA testing should end at age 60 for men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/ mL; at 70, unless a man is very healthy and has a higher than average PSA; at 75 for all men. The decision to biopsy a man with a PSA > 3 ng/mL should be based on a variety of factors including repeat blood draw for confirmatory testing of the PSA level, digital rectal examination results, and workup for benign disease. Additional reflex tests in blood such as a free-to-total PSA ratio, the Prostate Health Index, or 4Kscore, or urinary testing of PCA3, can also be informative in some patients. The best evidence suggests that more restricted indication for prostate biopsy and a more focused approach to pursue screening in men at highest risk of lethal cancer would retain most of the mortality benefits of aggressive screening schema, while importantly reducing harms from overdetection and overtreatment.""","""['Andrew J Vickers', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Hans Lilja']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Vickers et al: The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Recommendations for Prostate Cancer Screening (Urology 2016;91:12-18).', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Focus on the screening for prostate cancer by PSA.', 'Prostate cancer screening within a prostate specific antigen range of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml.: a comparison of digital rectal examination and free prostate specific antigen as supplemental screening tests.', 'Empirical estimates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis by age and prostate-specific antigen.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'Prostate cancer polygenic risk score and prediction of lethal prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.', 'One-Day Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Digital Pathology by Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

Methods and materials:   Eligible study patients included 439 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer who were treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone between 2003 and 2013, remained free of biochemical recurrence, and had at least 2 PSA values within the first year following RT. Of these, 130 were treated with SBRT, 220 with HDR brachytherapy, and 89 with IMRT. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare PSA nadirs (nPSA), time to nPSA, and PSA bounce parameters among the 3 modalities. Indicator variable analysis was used to develop empirical models of PSA decay using the treatment modalities as indicator variables.  Results:   Significantly more patients treated with SBRT or HDR brachytherapy achieved raw nPSAs of <0.5 ng/mL compared with patients treated with IMRT (76.2% and 75.9% vs 44.9%, respectively; P < .0001 for SBRT or HDR brachytherapy vs IMRT). On multivariate analysis, nPSA was significantly lower with SBRT and HDR compared with IMRT (P < .0001). Time to nPSA and bounce parameters was not significantly different among IMRT, SBRT, and HDR. Overall, SBRT and HDR brachytherapy caused significantly larger PSA decay rates (P < .001). When truncating follow-up at 1000 days, the corresponding decay rates were larger for all 3 modalities, with no significant differences between them.  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiation therapy and HDR brachytherapy produce lower nPSAs than IMRT. Within 1000 days of follow-up, the modalities produce similar rates of PSA decay; subsequently, decay continues (albeit at a slower pace) after SBRT and HDR brachytherapy but plateaus with IMRT. Because nPSA is a validated predictor of long-term outcome, these data not only suggest a distinct radiobiological effect with SBRT and HDR brachytherapy, but also predict for clinical outcomes that might equal or surpass those of IMRT.""","""['Amar U Kishan', 'Pin-Chieh Wang', 'Shrinivasa K Upadhyaya', 'Henrik Hauswald', 'D Jeffrey Demanes', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Mitchell Kamrava', 'Ahmad Sadeghi', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Nicolas D Prionas', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and biochemical control following stereotactic body radiation therapy, high dose rate brachytherapy, and low dose rate brachytherapy: A multi-institutional analysis of 3502 patients.', 'Multi-Institutional Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', ""Exploring Value From the Patient's Perspective Between Modern Radiation Therapy Modalities for Localized Prostate Cancer."", ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Is robotic arm stereotactic body radiation therapy “virtual high dose ratebrachytherapy” for prostate cancer?

Most HCC overexpress GPC3, whereas little GPC3 can be detected in normal adult liver and benign liver lesions. Therefore, it is important to understand the function of GPC3 in HCC tumor development as the GPC3 ligand may facilitate detection of HCC. In this study, a 12-mer peptide with the sequence of DHLASLWWGTEL (denoted as TJ12P1) was identified by screening a phage display peptide library that demonstrated ideal GPC3 binding affinity. We used TJ12P1 conjugated with near-infrared fluorescent (NIFR) dye Cy5.5 for tumor imaging. After intravenous injection of the imaging agent, TJ12P1, xenografts of high GPC3 expressing hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2, demonstrated significantly higher tumor accumulation (tumor/muscle ratio: 3.98 ± 0.36) than those of low GPC3 expressing prostate cancer cell line, PC3 (tumor/muscle ratio: 2.03 ± 0.23).

Preclinical studies suggest that weight loss from caloric restriction and increased physical activity may suppress hormonal, energy-sensing, and inflammatory factors that drive neoplastic progression; however, exact mechanisms are yet to be determined, and experiments in humans are limited.  Methods:   We conducted a randomized controlled trial among 40 overweight or obese, newly-diagnosed prostate cancer patients who elected prostatectomy to explore feasibility of a presurgical weight loss intervention that promoted a weight loss of roughly one kg. week(-1) via caloric restriction and physical activity, as well as to assess effects on tumor biology and circulating biomarkers. Measures of feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence, and safety) were primary endpoints. Exploratory aims were directed at the intervention's effect on tumor proliferation (Ki-67) and other tumor markers (activated caspase-3, insulin and androgen receptors, VEGF, TNFβ, NFκB, and 4E-BP1), circulating biomarkers (PSA, insulin, glucose, VEGF, TNFβ, leptin, SHBG, and testosterone), lymphocytic gene expression of corresponding factors and cellular bioenergetics in neutrophils, and effects on the gut microbiome. Consenting patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either: 1) weight loss via a healthful, guidelines-based diet and exercise regimen; or 2) a wait-list control. While biological testing is currently ongoing, this paper details our methods and feasibility outcomes.  Results:   The accrual target was met after screening 101 cases (enrollment rate: 39.6%). Other outcomes included a retention rate of 85%, excellent adherence (95%), and no serious reported adverse events. No significant differences by age, race, or weight status were noted between enrollees vs. non-enrollees. The most common reasons for non-participation were ""too busy"" (30%), medical exclusions (21%), and ""distance"" (16%).  Conclusions:   Presurgical trials offer a means to study the impact of diet and exercise interventions directly on tumor tissue, and other host factors that are feasible and safe, though modifications are needed to conduct trials within an abbreviated period of time and via distance medicine-based approaches. Pre-surgical trials are critical to elucidate the impact of lifestyle interventions on specific mechanisms that mediate carcinogenesis and which can be used subsequently as therapeutic targets.

This approach may present drawbacks, including the limited access to the perineum, the inevitable abduction of the patient's legs, and the limited space available in small operating theaters. To overcome these problems, in our center, we use, from over 5 years, a side-docking technique. We herein describe our technique and a series of patients who underwent RALP using such side-docking procedure.  Methods:   In our department, we have applied the side-docking technique for over 5 years, mainly in RALP procedures. The series reported includes 268 men undergoing RALP ± extended lymph node dissection (ePLND) between mid-2010 and 2014. After trocart positioning, the robot is entered at a 45° angle compared to the patient's main axis, coming in from the right side. Patient's legs are minimally abducted to <10°.  Results:   Mean docking time, from skin incision to full docking was 13 min. 41 % (109/268) of patients underwent simultaneous ePLND, dissecting nodes up till at least the iliac bifurcation. No conversion to open surgery was required. External collisions are infrequent with this configuration: No re-docking was necessary in this cohort.

The indications for surgery are based on the patient's general condition, type and stage of cancer, and survival time expectancy. Tumor modular endoprostheses have been increasingly used. Surgery should provide pain relief and improve the quality of life.  Methods:   Between 2010 and 2013, 67 patients with malignant metastases were surgically treated with resection prostheses. We performed a retrospective analysis of the indications for the surgery, its course, the type of the prostheses used, and the implantation techniques applied. We evaluated the most important clinical parameters influencing the postoperative quality of life of the patients.  Results:   Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are the most common primary tumors that metastasize to bones. The most common site of the lesions is the proximal femur; sporadically, they do occur in bones distal to the knee and elbow. After the surgery, all the patients could walk, most of them without crutches. The pain, rated on a VAS scale, decreased significantly, and the Karnofsky score improved. We observed that joint mobility and the strength of the muscles in the limbs allowed for normal functioning. Postoperative complications including infections and local tumor recurrences were rarely observed.  Conclusions:   The use of modular prostheses is an adequate method of treatment in patients with bone metastases. A radical resection of the tumor, which prevents local recurrences and loosening of implants, gives good outcomes. Reduced joint mobility resulting from muscle attachment cutting is well tolerated and concerns mainly patients that underwent operations on the humerus.""","""['Grzegorz Guzik']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Orthop Surg Res""","""['Endoprosthesis management of the extremities of children after resection of primary malignant bone tumors.', 'Treatment Outcomes and Quality of Life after the Implantation of Modular Prostheses of the Proximal Femur in Patients with Cancer Metastases.', 'Treatment of metastatic lesions localized in the acetabulum.', 'Orthopaedic management using new devices and prostheses.', 'Limb-sparing surgery for distal femoral and proximal tibial bone lesions: imaging findings with intraoperative correlation.', 'Mid and long-term overall survival after carcinologic resections of thyroid cancer bone metastases.', 'Megaprosthesis for Metastatic Bone Disease-A Comparative Analysis.', 'Surgical management of tibial metastases: a systematic review.', 'Bone marrow niches in the regulation of bone metastasis.', 'Challenges to endoprosthetic reconstruction after tumor resection around the knee : Management of intra- and postoperative complications.']"""

Human and mouse cells were screened using 242 anti-human or 176 antimouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing the cell surface protein profile.

Differentially expressed cell surface proteins were evaluated in conjunction with the known CD49f(+)/TROP2(high) phenotype of basal prostate progenitor cells and characterized by in vivo sandwich-transplantation experiments using nude mice. The phenotype of basal prostate progenitor cells was determined as CD9(+)/CD24(+)/CD29(+)/CD44(+)/CD47(+)/CD49f(+)/CD104(+)/CD147(+)/CD326(+)/Trop2(high) of mouse as well as human origin. Our analysis revealed several proteins, such as CD13, Syndecan-1 and stage-specific embryonal antigens (SSEAs), as being differentially expressed on murine and human CD49f(+) TROP2(+) basal prostate progenitor cells.

This study aimed to provide estimates of health resource utilization (HRU) and cost associated with all SRE types in Europe. HRU data were reported previously; cost data are reported herein. Methods Eligible patients from 49 centers across Austria (n = 57), the Czech Republic (n = 59), Finland (n = 60), Greece (n = 59), Portugal (n = 59), and Sweden (n = 62) had bone metastases or lesions secondary to breast, lung, or prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, and ≥1 index SRE (a SRE preceded by a SRE-free period of ≥ 6.5 months). SRE-related costs were estimated from a payer perspective using health resource utilization data from patient charts (before and after the index SRE diagnosis). Country-specific unit costs were from 2010 and local currencies were converted to 2010 euros. Results The mean costs across countries were €7043, €5242, €11,101, and €11,509 per radiation to bone, pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression event, respectively. Purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted mean cost ratios were similar in most countries, with the exception of radiation to bone. Limitations The overall burden of SREs may have been under-estimated owing to home visits and evaluations outside the hospital setting not being reported here. Conclusions All SREs were associated with substantial costs.

Thus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. However, castration resistance due to expression of constitutively active AR splice variants is a significant challenge to prostate cancer therapy; little is known why effectiveness of ADT can only last for a relatively short time. In the present study, we show that PCGEM1 interacts with splicing factors heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and U2AF65, as determined by RNA precipitation and Western blot, suggesting a role for PCGEM1 in alternative splicing. In support of this possibility, PCGEM1 is correlated with AR3, a predominant and clinically important form of AR splice variants in prostate cancer. Moreover, androgen deprivation (AD) induces PCGEM1 and causes its accumulation in nuclear speckles. Finally, we show that the AD-induced PCGEM1 regulates the competition between hnRNP A1 and U2AF65 for AR pre-mRNA. AD promotes PCGEM1 to interact with both hnRNP A1 and U2AF65 with different consequences. While the interaction of PCGEM1 with hnRNP A1 suppresses AR3 by exon skipping, its interaction with U2AF65 promotes AR3 by exonization.

CARM1 overexpression has been implicated in breast, prostate, and liver cancers and therefore is an attractive target for cancer therapy. To date, little about the kinetic properties of CARM1 is known. In this study, substrate specificity and the kinetic mechanism of the human enzyme were determined. Substrate specificity was examined by testing CARM1 activity with several histone H3-based peptides in a radiometric assay. Comparison of kcat/KM values reveals that methylation of H3R17 is preferred over that of H3R26. These effects are KM-driven as kcat values remain relatively constant for the peptides tested. Shortening the peptide at the C-terminus by five amino acid residues greatly reduced binding affinity, indicating distal residues may contribute to substrate binding. CARM1 appears to bind monomethylated peptides with an affinity similar to that of unmethylated peptides. Monitoring of the CARM1-dependent production of monomethylated and dimethylated peptides over time by self-assembled monolayer and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry revealed that methylation by CARM1 is distributive. Additionally, dead-end and product inhibition studies suggest CARM1 conforms to a random sequential kinetic mechanism. By defining the kinetic properties and mechanism of CARM1, these studies may aid in the development of small molecule CARM1 inhibitors.""","""['Suzanne L Jacques', 'Katrina P Aquino', 'Jodi Gureasko', 'P Ann Boriack-Sjodin', 'Margaret Porter Scott', 'Robert A Copeland', 'Thomas V Riera']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Methylation of histone H3 by coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1.', 'Structural Insights into Ternary Complex Formation of Human CARM1 with Various Substrates.', 'Identification of a novel inhibitor of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1)-mediated methylation of histone H3 Arg-17.', 'Transition state mimics are valuable mechanistic probes for structural studies with the arginine methyltransferase CARM1.', 'Catalytic properties and kinetic mechanism of human recombinant Lys-9 histone H3 methyltransferase SUV39H1: participation of the chromodomain in enzymatic catalysis.', 'Discovery and biological evaluation of novel CARM1/HDAC2 dual-targeting inhibitors with anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'A Direct Assay for Measuring the Activity and Inhibition of Coactivator-Associated Arginine Methyltransferase 1.', 'The Oncogenic Role and Immune Infiltration for CARM1 Identified by Pancancer Analysis.', 'Independent transcriptomic and proteomic regulation by type I and II protein arginine methyltransferases.', 'Histone Arginine Methyltransferase CARM1-Mediated H3R26me2 Is Essential for Morula-to-Blastocyst Transition in Pigs.']"""

Methods:   From November 2003 to June 2014, a total of 990 intermediate and high risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) were enrolled and stratified into two groups according to proportion of positive cores-BDPC group had ≥ 33.3% ratio of positive cores from the prostate base among all positive cores and AMPC group < 33.3% in systemic biopsy. Between two groups, we compared the rate of pathologic outcomes and biochemical recurrence (BCR). We performed multivariate logistic regression model to confirm the significance of BDPC to seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and Cox proportional hazard analysis to BCR.  Results:   Among these 990 PCa patients, the 487 patients in BDPC group had more advanced clinical stage (p<0.001), a higher biopsy GS (p = 0.002), and a higher rate of extracapsular extension (ECE), SVI and BCR (all p<0.001) than AMPC group. The patients in BDPC group had poor BCR free survival rate via Kaplan-meier analysis (p<0.001). The ratio of the base positive cores was a significant predictor to SVI in multivariate analysis (p < 0.001) and significant predictor of BCR in multivariate Cox proportional analysis (hazard ratio: 1.466, p = 0.004).

Results:   HHV-8 antigen expression representing lytic and latent infections was seen in 73.9% of prostates from HHV-8 seropositive subjects. Latent infections were seen predominantly in glandular epithelia whereas lytic gene expression was seen mainly in macrophages in prostate stroma. Macrophage infiltrates were significantly increased in sections expressing HHV-8 proteins.  Conclusion:   HHV-8 establishes a chronic latent infection in the prostate, which is associated with an increased macrophage infiltrate.""","""['Jill D Henning', 'Clareann H Bunker', 'Alan L Patrick', 'Frank J Jenkins']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Elevated Serum PSA is Associated With Human Herpesvirus 8 Infection and Increased Circulating Cytokine Levels in Men From Tobago.', 'Detection of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in normal prostates.', 'Comparison of human sera reactivities in immunoblots with recombinant human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 proteins associated with the latent (ORF73) and lytic (ORFs 65, K8.1A, and K8.1B) replicative cycles and in immunofluorescence assays with HHV-8-infected BCBL-1 cells.', 'Persistent/latent infection of human beta-herpesvirus.', 'The current state of prostate cancer treatment in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'JC Polyoma Virus as a Possible Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer Development - Immunofluorescence and Molecular Based Case Control Study.', 'Human herpesvirus 8 infection is associated with prostate cancer among IFNL4-ΔG carriers.', 'Monocytes and Macrophages as Viral Targets and Reservoirs.', 'Elevated Serum PSA is Associated With Human Herpesvirus 8 Infection and Increased Circulating Cytokine Levels in Men From Tobago.']"""

We investigated the impact of genetic variants of selenoproteins on plasma selenium levels and cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The study cohort comprised 722 patients seen at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who had localized/locally advanced PCa (i.e., stage T3 or less, N0, and M0) from 1994 to 2001. Fifty-five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six selenoprotein genes (TXNRD1, TXNRD2, SEP15, GPX3, SELENBP1, and SEPP1) were analyzed. Logistic regression is used to examine associations of genotypes and plasma selenium levels with risk of aggressive disease, defined as D'Amico intermediate/high risk categories. Step down permutation was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.  Results:   Three hundred and forty-eight patients (48%) had aggressive disease at diagnosis. Two SNPs were associated with cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis (unadjusted P = 0.017 and 0.018, respectively). The odds ratio for aggressive disease in patients carrying TXNRD2 rs1005873-AG/GG genotypes or SELENBP1 rs10788804-AG/AA genotypes was 1.54 (95% CI = 1.08, 2.20) and 1.45 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.98), respectively, compared to TXNRD2 rs1005873-AA or SELENBP1 rs10788804-GG carriers. Four SNPs in TXNRD2 (rs1005873, rs13054371, rs3788310, and rs9606174) and the rs230820 in SEPP1 were associated with plasma selenium levels (unadjusted P < 0.05). Permutation adjusted P-values were not statistically significant for all these comparisons at the cut-off point of 0.05.

Methods:   We focused on investigation whether the exposure of prostate cells (PNT1A, 22Rv1, and PC-3) to sarcosine-related amino acids (glycine, dimethylglycine, and sarcosine) affects their aggressiveness (cell mobility and division rates, using real-time cell based assay). The effect of supplementation on expression of glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT) mRNA was examined using qRT-PCR. Finally, post-treatment amino acids patterns were determined with consequent statistical processing using the Ward's method, factorial ANOVA and principal component analysis (P < 0.05).  Results:   The highest migration induced sarcosine and glycine in metastatic PC-3 cells (a decrease in relative free area about 53% and 73%). The highest cell division was achieved after treatment of 22Rv1 and PC-3 cells with sarcosine (time required for division decreased by 65% or 45%, when compared to untreated cells). qRT-PCR revealed also significant effects on expression of GNMT.

However, more systemic studies are needed to further define PP1 effects on AR, particularly in the settings of prostate cancer cells and under conditions mimicking androgen ablation.  Methods:   PP1 effects on AR protein expression, degradation, ubiquitination, and stabilization were examined in non-prostate cancer cells, followed by validation on exogenous settings in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP and VCaP) and castration-resistant (C4-2) prostate cancer cells. Effects of PP1 on AR protein expression, on AR-mediated transcription of exogenous reporter and endogenous gene, and on LNCaP and C4-2 cell proliferation were monitored under androgen-containing versus androgen-depleted conditions to assess the effects of PP1 on AR responsiveness to androgen.  Results:   In this report, we determined that PP1 functions to stabilize AR proteins that exclusively undergo the proteasome-dependent degradation, and the stimulatory effects of PP1 were predominantly mediated by the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD). Consistently, PP1 enhances AR protein stability by disrupting the LBD-mediated and K48-linked ubiquitination cascade. We further validated the above findings in the prostate cancer cells by showing that PP1 inhibition can increase ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation of endogenous AR under androgen deprivation. Significantly, we found that PP1 could markedly activate AR transcriptional activities under conditions mimicking androgen ablation and that androgen sensitivity was substantially evoked by PP1 inhibition in the prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   As summarized in a simplified model, our studies defined an essential PP1-mediated pathway for AR protein stabilization that can compensate the loss of androgen and established a mechanistic link between PP1 and androgen responsiveness. The amplified PP1-dependence for AR activation under the androgen ablated conditions provides a rationale to therapeutically target the PP1-AR module in the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our findings also suggested an alternative AR-targeting compounds screening strategy that aims to circumvent PP1-AR interaction.""","""['Xiaming Liu', 'Weiwei Han', 'Sarah Gulla', 'Nicholas I Simon', 'Yanfei Gao', 'Jihong Liu', 'Liang Wang', 'Hongmei Yang', 'Xiaoping Zhang', 'Shaoyong Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The immunophilin ligands cyclosporin A and FK506 suppress prostate cancer cell growth by androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of androgen receptor through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in a low androgen environment.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Functional analysis of androgen receptor N-terminal and ligand binding domain interacting coregulators in prostate cancer.', 'Repositioning Dopamine D2 Receptor Agonist Bromocriptine to Enhance Docetaxel Chemotherapy and Treat Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential regulation of the androgen receptor by protein phosphatase regulatory subunits.']"""

In prostate cancer, several miRNAs are expressed abnormally suggesting they may be useful markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and potential therapeutic intervention in this disease. However, the contribution of individual miRNAs to the development and progression of this disease remains poorly understood. This study investigated the role of miR-24, which has not been extensively studied in relation to prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used PCR to investigate the expression of miR-24 in a panel of prostate cancer cell-lines and in a series of clinical prostate biopsy specimens. The biological significance of miR-24 expression in prostate cancer cells was assessed by a series of in vitro bioassays and the effect on proposed targets p27 (CDKN1B) and p16 (CDK2NA) was investigated.  Results:   We showed that miR-24 expression was significantly lower in prostate cancer cell lines compared to a normal prostate epithelial cell line. Decreased expression of miR-24 was also more frequently observed in both needle core and prostatectomy tumor tissue relative to matched normal tissue. Low miR-24 expression correlated with high PSA serum levels and other markers of increased prostate cancer progression. Importantly, over-expression of miR-24 inhibited cell cycle, proliferation, migration, and clonogenic potential of prostate cancer cells, as well as inducing apoptosis. p27 and p16 were confirmed as targets of miR-24 in prostate cancer cells and a significant inverse correlation between miR-24 and p27 was revealed in clinical prostatectomy specimens.  Conclusions:   These findings provide evidence that miR-24 has a tumor suppressor role in prostate cancer and also targets p27 and p16 in prostate cancer cells.

SIRT1 is the mammalian homologue of the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) gene, and is abnormally expressed in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, it is hypothesized that SIRT1 mediates the invasion/metastatic ability of prostate cancer via EMT regulation. This study thus investigated the effect of SIRT1 gene on the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cell line PC-3 via the small interference RNA (siRNA) against SIRT1. MATERIAL AND METHODS SiRNA construct was transfected into PC-3 cells, which were tested for the cell migration and invasion ability by scratch assay and Transwell migration assay, respectively. Expression levels of vimentin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin were further quantified by Western blotting and RT-PCR. RESULTS Both mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 were depressed after siRNA transfection, along with weakened migration and invasion ability of PC-3 cells. Elevated E-cadherin and suppressed N-cadherin and vimentin were observed in those transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS The silencing of SIRT1 gene in PC-3 cells can suppress the movement, migration, and invasion functions of prostate cancer cells, possibly via the down-regulation of mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin accompanied with up-regulation of epithelial marker N-cadherin, thus reversing the EMT process.""","""['Ying Cui', 'Jiang Li', 'Fei Zheng', 'Yongri Ouyang', 'Xi Chen', 'Lei Zhang', 'Yang Chen', 'Lin Wang', 'Shijie Mu', 'Huizhong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'SIRT1 participates in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of EC-9706 and Eca-109 cells in vitro by regulating Snail expression.', 'The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Silencing of ezrin gene inhibits proliferation and invasion of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Antiprostate Cancer Activity of Ineupatolide Isolated from Carpesium cernuum L.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Astragalus Polysaccharides Inhibits Tumorigenesis and Lipid Metabolism Through miR-138-5p/SIRT1/SREBP1 Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Apigenin Prevents Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury by Activating the SIRT1 Pathway.']"""

This applies to Black men with prostate cancer, as there is little systematic research concerning psychological distress in these men. This study was designed to validate the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) in Black men with prostate cancer to help facilitate research within this group.  Methods:   At three institutions, Black men with prostate cancer (n = 101) completed the MAX-PC, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Distress Thermometer.  Results:   The average age of the 101 men was 66 (SD = 10) and 58 % had early-stage disease. The MAX-PC and its subscales (Prostate Cancer Anxiety, PSA Anxiety, and Fear of Recurrence) produced strong coefficient alphas (0.89, 0.88, 0.71, and 0.77, respectively). Factor analysis supported the three-factor structure of the scale established in earlier findings. The MAX-PC also demonstrated strong validity. MAX-PC total scores correlated highly with the Anxiety subscale of the HADS (r = 0.59, p < 0.01) and the FACT Emotional Well-Being subscale (r = -0.55, p < 0.01). Demonstrating discriminant validity, the correlation with the HADS Depression subscale (r = 0.40, p < 0.01) and the CES-D (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) was lower compared to that with the HADS Anxiety subscale.

The Navigo™ system (UC-care, Israel) uses regular TRUS images and electrospatial monitoring to generate a 3D model of the prostate. The aim of this study was to compare cancer detection rates between the Navigo™ system and conventional TRUS, in patients without a history of PCa.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective study by collecting data from all patients who underwent 12-core prostate biopsies from lateral peripheral zones between September 2013 and February 2015 at the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in 's-Hertogenbosch (Netherlands).  Results:   A total of 325 patients met our inclusion criteria. 77.8 % of biopsy sessions were performed using the Navigo™ system. There was no statistically significant difference in PCa detection (39.9 vs 46.2 % with Navigo™ system and TRUS, respectively). Using the Navigo™ system for taking prostate biopsies proved not to be associated with the presence of PCa at biopsy, likewise for clinically significant PCa and for both subgroups.  Limitations:   The limitations of the study include its retrospective design, the limited number of patients in the conventional TRUS group, the statistically significant different number of biopsy sessions and the ones performed by an advanced physician in both groups.

Experimental design:   Patients with advanced solid tumors received BIND-014 every three weeks (n = 28) or weekly (n = 27), with dose levels ranging from 3.5 to 75 mg/m(2) and 15 to 45 mg/m(2), respectively.  Results:   BIND-014 was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common drug-related toxicities (>20% of patients) on either schedule included neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, alopecia, and diarrhea. BIND-014 demonstrated a dose-linear pharmacokinetic profile, distinct from docetaxel, with prolonged persistence of docetaxel-encapsulated circulating nanoparticles. Of the 52 patients evaluable for response, one had a complete response (cervical cancer on the every three week schedule) and five had partial responses (ampullary adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers on the every-three-week schedule, and breast and gastroesophageal cancers on the weekly schedule). Responses were noted in both PSMA-detectable and -undetectable tumors.

Methods:   A total of 105 patients with biopsy-proven GS 7(3+4) PC who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI followed by RP were included. Two radiologists assigned PI-RADSv2 scores for each patient. Preoperative clinicopathological variables and PI-RADSv2 scores were compared between patients with and without downgrading after RP using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analyses with Firth's bias correction were performed to assess their association with downgrading.  Results:   Pathological downgrading was identified in ten (9.5 %) patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, percentage of cores with GS 7(3+4), and greatest percentage of core length (GPCL) with GS 7(3+4) were significantly lower in patients with downgrading (p = 0.002-0.037). There was no significant difference in age and clinical stage (p = 0.537-0.755). PI-RADSv2 scores were significantly lower in patients with downgrading (3.8 versus 4.4, p = 0.012). At univariate logistic regression analysis, PSA, PSA density, and PI-RADSv2 scores were significant predictors of downgrading (p = 0.003-0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed only PSA density and PI-RADSv2 scores as independent predictors of downgrading (p = 0.014-0.042).  Conclusions:   The PI-RADSv2 scoring system was an independent predictor of pathological downgrading after RP in patients with biopsy-proven GS 7(3+4) PC.  Key points:   • PI-RADSv2 was an independent predictor of downgrading in biopsy-proven GS 7(3+4) PC • PSA density was also an independent predictor of downgrading • MRI may assist in identifying AS candidates in biopsy-proven GS 7(3+4) PC patients.""","""['Sungmin Woo', 'Sang Youn Kim', 'Joongyub Lee', 'Seung Hyup Kim', 'Jeong Yeon Cho']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Role of PI-RADS Version 2 for Prediction of Upgrading in Biopsy-Proven Prostate Cancer With Gleason Score 6.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, Version 2, Assessment Categories and Pathologic Outcomes in Patients With Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7 Prostate Cancer Diagnosed at Biopsy.', 'Prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy with PI-RADS version 2 in prostate cancers: initial results.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeting on Pathologic Upgrading and Downgrading at Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Clinicopathological factors associated with pathological upgrading from biopsy to prostatectomy in patients with ISUP grade group ≤2 prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Effects of the addition of quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient data on the diagnostic performance of the PI-RADS v2 scoring system to detect clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Steering Committee: PI-RADS v2 Status Update and Future Directions.', 'PI-RADS v2: Current standing and future outlook.']"""

The aim of the study is to explore the mechanisms of PCa metastasis and to search for potential prognostic markers using proteomics. Two-dimensional fluorescent differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was used to quantify proteins in normal prostate epithelial cells, bone metastasis-derived PC-3 cells, and visceral metastasis-derived PC-3M cells. Metastatic potential was confirmed by flow cytometry, electron microscopy, proliferating cell nuclear antigen assay, and wound healing assay. Differential protein expression was compared between PCa cells with different metastatic potentials (LNcap, DU145, PC-3 and PC-3M) and normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Selected candidate proteins in human prostate tissues were analyzed using GOA, UniProt and GeneCards analyses. Eighty-six proteins were differentially expressed between cell lines (>1.5-fold, P<0.05). Among them, twelve proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. One protein was upregulated in normal prostate epithelial cells, nine proteins were upregulated in PC-3, and two proteins were upregulated in PC-3M. Proteins were divided into five groups according to their functions. The SETDB1 protein was closely associated with the prognosis of PCa. Bioinformatics suggested that SETDB1 might promote PCa bone metastasis through the WNT pathway. In conclusion, SETDB1 might be associated with the development of bone metastases from PCa.

Moreover, in prostate cancer, aminopeptidase N (APN) expression is closely correlated with metastasis. Ubenimex, an APN inhibitor, is widely used as an adjunct therapy for cancer, enhancing the function of immunocompetent cells and conferring antitumor effects. However, due to the low expression of APN, it is rarely used to treat prostate cancer. Recently, the induction of autophagy as a molecular mechanism has been strongly connected with tumor cell death. Thus, we investigated whether ubenimex could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion by downregulating APN expression to induce autophagic cell death in prostate cancer cells. The LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines were treated with different doses of ubenimex. Cell viability was measured using growth curve analysis and WST-8 proliferation assay. Autophagic cell death was assessed using fluorescence microscopy and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. Protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. Autophagosomes were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. Wound-healing migration assays were performed to determine the migratory ability of the PC-3 cells. In addition, nude mice were used in the present study to examine PC-3 cell proliferation in vivo. The results revealed that APN expression differed between the metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. In addition, ubenimex inhibited APN expression in the prostate cancer cells. Ubenimex increased prostate cancer cell death, as determined using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay. This effect was accompanied by increased levels of LC3B. Furthermore, ubenimex inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Ubenimex inhibited the cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells by downregulating APN expression. Finally, ubenimex induced autophagic cell death in both metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. Based on these results, ubenimex appears to be an excellent adjunctive therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaoqing Wang', 'Zhihong Niu', 'Yang Jia', 'Meng Cui', 'Liping Han', 'Yongfei Zhang', 'Zheng Liu', 'Dongbin Bi', 'Shuai Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Ubenimex inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in renal cell carcinoma: the effect is autophagy-associated.', 'Ubenimex, an APN inhibitor, could serve as an anti‑tumor drug in RT112 and 5637 cells by operating in an Akt‑associated manner.', 'Role of ubenimex as an anticancer drug and its synergistic effect with Akt inhibitor in human A375 and A2058 cells.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'Zinc as an anti-tumor agent in prostate cancer and in other cancers.', 'Scandium-44: Diagnostic Feasibility in Tumor-Related Angiogenesis.', 'Therapeutic Performance Evaluation of 213Bi-Labelled Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13)-Affine NGR-Motif (213BiBi-DOTAGA-cKNGRE) in Experimental Tumour Model: A Treasured Tailor for Oncology.', 'Therapeutic effect on Alveolar echinococcosis by targeting EM-Leucine aminopeptidase.', 'Aminopeptidase N Inhibitors as Pointers for Overcoming Antitumor Treatment Resistance.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of APN and AKT Dual-Target Inhibitors.']"""

Previous studies confirmed that PC-1 contributes to malignant progression in prostate cancer with an important role in castration-resistant stage. In the present work, we identified its impact in mechanisms leading to neuroendocrine (NE) transdifferentiation. We established for long-term PC-1 overexpression an inducible expression system derived from the prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP. We observed that PC-1 overexpression itself initiates characteristics of neuroendocrine cells, but the effect was much more pronounced in the presence of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report that treatment with IL-6 leads to a significant upregulation of PC-1 in LNCaP cells. Other TPD52 isoforms were not affected. Proceeding from this result, we conclude that PC-1 overexpression enhances the IL-6-mediated differentiation of LNCaP cells into a NE-like phenotype, noticeable by morphological changes and increased expression of typical NE markers, like chromogranin A, synaptophysin or beta-3 tubulin. Immunofluorescent staining of IL-6-treated PC-1-overexpressing LNCaP cells indicates a considerable PC-1 accumulation at the end of the long-branched neuron-like cell processes, which are typically formed by NE cells. Additionally, the experimentally initiated NE transdifferentiation correlates with the androgen receptor status, which was upregulated additively. In summary, our data provide evidence for an involvement of PC-1 in NE transdifferentiation, frequently associated with castration resistance, which is a major therapeutic challenge in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Tom Moritz', 'Simone Venz', 'Heike Junker', 'Sarah Kreuz', 'Reinhard Walther', 'Uwe Zimmermann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate carcinoma: focusing on its pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathological features.', 'Multipathways for transdifferentiation of human prostate cancer cells into neuroendocrine-like phenotype.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'The influence of neuroendocrine differentiation on the growth and androgen receptor expression of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Prostate cancer histoseminar: Update of the 2016 WHO classification\xa0-\xa0case no6: Castration resistant prostate cancer with partial neuroendocrin differenciation.', 'AMPK targets a proto-oncogene TPD52 (isoform 3) expression and its interaction with LKB1 suppress AMPK-GSK3β signaling axis in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of the Regulatory Targets of miR-3687 and miR-4417 in Prostate Cancer Cells Using a Proteomics Approach.', 'Molecular Insight Into the IRE1α-Mediated Type I Interferon Response Induced by Proteasome Impairment in Myeloid Cells of the Brain.', 'Androgen-dependent alternative mRNA isoform expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Long non‑coding RNA ferritin heavy polypeptide 1 pseudogene\xa03 controls glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis via regulation of the microRNA‑224‑5p/tumor protein D52 axis.']"""

Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy are at increased risk of AKI because of intraoperative bleeding, obstructive uropathy, older age, and preexisting chronic kidney disease. In particular, robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP), which is in increasing demand as an alternative surgical option for retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), is associated with postoperative renal dysfunction because pneumoperitoneum during RALP can decrease cardiac output and renal perfusion. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative AKI between RRP and RALP.We included 1340 patients who underwent RRP (n = 370) or RALP (n = 970) between 2013 and 2014. Demographics, cancer-related data, and perioperative laboratory data were evaluated. Postoperative AKI was determined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Operation and anesthesia time, estimated blood loss, amounts of administered fluids and transfused packed red blood cells, and the lengths of the postoperative intensive care unit and hospital stays were evaluated. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce the influence of possible confounding variables and adjust for intergroup differences between the RRP and RALP groups.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the RRP and RALP groups included 307 patients, respectively. The operation time and anesthesia time in RALP were significantly longer than in the RRP group (both P < 0.001). However, the estimated blood loss and amount of administered fluids in RALP were significantly lower than in RRP (both P < 0.001). Also, RALP demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of transfusion and smaller amount of transfused packed red blood cells than RRP (both P < 0.001).

Furthermore, the length of hospital stay in RALP was also significantly shorter (P < 0.001).The incidence of AKI after RALP is significantly lower than after RRP.

Materials and methods:   Exclusion criteria were treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors, LH-releasing hormone analogues or testosterone replacement. Criteria of bGS upgrading were as follows: (i) bGS 6 to pathological Gleason score (pGS) >6, (ii) bGS 7 with pattern 3 + 4 to pGS 7 with pattern 4 + 3 or to pGS >7, (iii) bGS 7 with pattern 4 + 3 to pGS >7. Patients who showed bGS >7 were excluded from the cohort.  Results:   The study included 209 patients. Tumor upgrading was assessed in 76 (36.4%) cases of the entire cohort, in 51 out of 130 cases (39.2%) of the bGS 6 group and 25 out of 79 patients (31.6%) in the bGS 7 cluster. Logistic regression models showed that independent clinical covariates predicting the risk of bGS upgrading included TT (OR 1.058; p = 0.027) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (OR 23.3; p = 0.008) as well as TT (OR 1.057; p = 0.029) with PSA (OR 1.061; p = 0.023). The model suggests that 1 unit increase in TT plasma levels increases the odds of bGS upgrading by 5.8 or 5.7%.

Methods:   This study was designed to investigate the changes in ginsenoside content in ginseng after treatment with a microwave-irradiation thermal process and to verify the anticancer effects of the extracts. To confirm the anticancer effect of microwave-irradiated processed ginseng (MG), it was tested in three human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells). Involvements of apoptosis and autophagy were assessed using Western blotting.  Results:   After microwave treatment, the content of ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd in the extracts decreased, whereas the content of ginsenosides 20(S)-Rg3, 20(R)-Rg3, Rk1, and Rg5 increased. Antiproliferation results for the human cancer cell lines treated with ginseng extracts indicate that PC-3 cells treated with MG showed the highest activity with an half maximal inhibitory concentration of 48 μg/mL. We also showed that MG suppresses the growth of human prostate cancer cell xenografts in athymic nude mice as an in vivo model. This growth suppression by MG is associated with the inductions of cell death and autophagy.

In this work, the authors present the development of an in-house software tool to verify target position with an Elekta-Synergy linear accelerator using kV planar images acquired during treatment delivery.  Methods:   In-house software, SeedTracker, was developed in matlab to perform the following three functions: 1. predict intended seed positions in a planar view perpendicular to any gantry angle, simulating a portal imaging device, from the 3D seed co-ordinates derived from the treatment planning system; 2. autosegment seed positions in kV planar images; and 3. report the position shift based on the seed positions in the projection images. The performance of SeedTracker was verified using a CIRS humanoid phantom (CIRS, VA, USA) implanted with three Civco gold seed markers (Civco, IA, USA) in the prostate. The true positive rate of autosegmentation (TPRseg) and the accuracy of the software in alerting the user when the isocenter position was outside the tolerance (TPRtrig) were studied. Two-dimensional and 3D static position offsets introduced to the humanoid phantom and 3D dynamic offsets introduced to a gel phantom containing gold seeds were used for evaluation of the system.  Results:   SeedTracker showed a TPRseg of 100% in the humanoid phantom for projection images acquired at all angles except in the ranges of 80°-100° and 260°-280° where seeds are obscured by anatomy. This resulted in a TPRtrig of 88% over the entire treatment range for considered 3D static offsets introduced to the phantom. For 2D static offsets where the position offsets were only introduced in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions, the TPRtrig of SeedTracker was limited by both seed detectability and positional offset. SeedTracker showed a false positive trigger in the projection angle range between 130°-170° and 310°-350° (a maximum of 24% of treatment time) due to limited information that can be derived from monoscopic images. The system accurately determined the dynamic trajectory of the isocenter position in the superior and inferior direction for the studied dynamic offset scenarios based on the seed position in monoscopic images.  Conclusions:   The developed software has been shown to accurately autosegment the seed positions in kV planar images except for two 20° arcs where seeds are obscured by anatomical structures. The isocenter trajectories determined by the system, based on the monoscopic images, provide useful information for monitoring the prostate position.

Methods:   Agarose gels of variable concentrations and loadings were investigated to simulate various soft tissue types. Oils, fats, and Vaseline were investigated as surrogates for adipose tissue and bone marrow. Anthropomorphic shapes of bone and organs were realized using 3D-printing techniques based on segmentations of patient CT-scans. All materials were characterized in dual energy CT and MRI to adapt CT numbers, electron density, effective atomic number, as well as T1- and T2-relaxation times to patient and literature values.  Results:   Soft tissue simulation could be achieved with agarose gels in combination with a gadolinium-based contrast agent and NaF to simulate muscle, prostate, and tumor tissues. Vegetable oils were shown to be a good representation for adipose tissue in all modalities. Inner bone was realized using a mixture of Vaseline and K2HPO4, resulting in both a fatty bone marrow signal in MRI and inhomogeneous areas of low and high attenuation in CT. The high attenuation of outer bone was additionally adapted by applying gypsum bandages to the 3D-printed hollow bone case with values up to 1200 HU. Deformable hollow organs were manufactured using silicone. Signal loss in the MR images based on the conductivity of the gels needs to be further investigated.

Results:   Over a median follow-up period of 118 months, the 10-year prostate-specific antigen failure-free survival, prostate-specific antigen failure-free, salvage hormonal therapy-free, prostate cancer-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 70.2 %, 78.7 %, 89.2 %, 100 %, and 88.8 %, respectively.

RNA degradation distorts the RNA-seq read coverage in a gene-specific manner, and has profound influences on whole-genome gene expression profiling.  Result:   We developed the transcript integrity number (TIN) to measure RNA degradation. When applied to 3 independent RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrated TIN is a reliable and sensitive measure of the RNA degradation at both transcript and sample level. Through comparing 10 prostate cancer clinical samples with lower RNA integrity to 10 samples with higher RNA quality, we demonstrated that calibrating gene expression counts with TIN scores could effectively neutralize RNA degradation effects by reducing false positives and recovering biologically meaningful pathways. When further evaluating the performance of TIN correction using spike-in transcripts in RNA-seq data generated from the Sequencing Quality Control consortium, we found TIN adjustment had better control of false positives and false negatives (sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.91, accuracy = 0.90), as compared to gene expression analysis results without TIN correction (sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 0.50, accuracy = 0.86).

Fifteen percent of men surveyed had a family history of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer knowledge was moderate, with at least 84 % of men responding correctly to 5 of 10 questions referring to prostate cancer risk and prevention. Most men had a favorable attitude towards screening. Starch formed the major portion of the diet in 68 % of men and 35 % of men engaged in no physical activity.

Methods and material:   Ten patients were studied. Each patient received planning computed tomography (CT) images with contrast agent. All of the plans were done on virtually simulated contrast-free CT scans. The plan approved by the radiation oncologist was replicated to the contrast CT series. In both of the plans the same monitor unit was used. The doses calculated from the two plans were compared in regard to target volumes and organs at risk. A paired sample t-test was used to evaluate the differences in cumulative dose volume histogram between the two plans.  Results:   We showed that the use of contrast agent may cause significant differences in dose distribution. There was a significant decrease in doses received by planning target volume (PTV70), rectum V65 Gy, rectum V40 Gy, bladder V65 Gy, penile bulb V40 Gy in plans with contrast-enhanced CT sets. The decrease in mean, maximum and minimum doses received by PTV70 also contributed to the significant decrease in conformity index.  Conclusions:   Using a contrast agent at the time of CT simulation may cause significant differences in dose distribution. For this reason, the plan should always be carried out on non-contrast CT data sets to avoid additional errors in the treatment planning process.""","""['Tülay Ercan', 'Şefik İğdem', 'Gül Alço']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Jpn J Radiol""","""['Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Influence of computed tomography contrast agent on radiotherapy dose calculation for pancreatic carcinoma: A dosimetric study based on tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy techniques.', 'A dosimetric comparison of tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with pelvic nodal radiation therapy.', 'Optimising the dosimetric quality and efficiency of post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: a planning study comparing the performance of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with an optimised seven-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique.', 'Assessing the role of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) relative to IMRT and helical tomotherapy in the management of localized, locally advanced, and post-operative prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric effects of embolization material artefacts in arteriovenous malformations stereotactic radiosurgery on treatment planning calculation.']"""

To evaluate the ability of the human prostate to synthesize de novo steroids, we examined the expression of key enzymes and proteins involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism.  Methods:   Using TissueScan™ Cancer qPCR Arrays and quantitative RT-PCR, we performed comparative gene expression analyses between various prostate cell lines and biopsies, including normal, hyperplastic, cancerous, and androgen-deprived prostate cells lines, as well as normal, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), PCa, and CRPC human specimens. These studies were complemented with steroid biosynthesis studies in normal and BPH cells.  Results:   Normal human prostate WPMY-1 and WPE1-NA22, benign prostate hyperplasia BPH-1, and cancer PC-3, LNCaP, and VCaP cell lines, as well as normal, BPH, PCa, and CRPC specimens, were used. Although all cell lines express mRNA encoding for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the mitochondrial translocator protein TSPO and cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 were only observed in WPMY-1, BPH-1, and LNCaP cells. HSD3B1, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1 are involved in androgen formation and were not found in most cell lines. WPE1-NA22 and BPH-1 cells were unable to synthesize de novo steroids from mevalonate. Moreover, androgen-deprived cells did not have alterations in the expression of enzymes that could lead to de novo steroid formation. All prostate specimens expressed TSPO and CYP11A1. HSD3B1/2, CYP17A1, HSD17B5, and CYP19A1 mRNA expression was distinct to the profile observed in cells lines. The majority of BPH (90.9%) and PCa (83.1%) specimens contained CYP17A1, compared to control (normal) specimens (46.7%). BPH (82%), PCa (59%), normal (40%), and CRPC (34%) specimens expressed the four key enzymes that metabolize cholesterol to androgens.  Conclusion:   These studies question the use of prostate cell lines to study steroid biosynthesis and demonstrate that human prostate samples contain transcripts encoding for key steroidogenic enzymes and proteins indicating that they have the potential to synthesize de novo steroids. We propose CYP17A1 as a candidate enzyme that can be used for patient stratification and treatment in BPH and PCa.""","""['Monica Sakai', 'Daniel B Martinez-Arguelles', 'Armen G Aprikian', 'Anthony M Magliocco', 'Vassilios Papadopoulos']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Evidence for steroidogenic potential in human prostate cell lines and tissues.', 'Intratumoral conversion of adrenal androgen precursors drives androgen receptor-activated cell growth in prostate cancer more potently than de novo steroidogenesis.', 'Evidence of limited contributions for intratumoral steroidogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Key targets of hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 can form homodimers or can heterodimerize with other G-protein-coupled receptors to form receptor complexes that can amplify or decrease the signaling capacity of each individual receptor. Using biophysical and biochemical approaches, we found that CXCR4 can form an induced heterodimer with cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) in human breast and prostate cancer cells. Simultaneous, agonist-dependent activation of CXCR4 and CB2 resulted in reduced CXCR4-mediated expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ultimately reduced cancer cell functions such as calcium mobilization and cellular chemotaxis. Given that treatment with cannabinoids has been shown to reduce invasiveness of cancer cells as well as CXCR4-mediated migration of immune cells, it is plausible that CXCR4 signaling can be silenced through a physical heterodimeric association with CB2, thereby inhibiting subsequent functions of CXCR4. Taken together, the data illustrate a mechanism by which the cannabinoid system can negatively modulate CXCR4 receptor function and perhaps tumor progression.""","""['Christopher J Coke', 'Kisha A Scarlett', 'Mahandranauth A Chetram', 'Kia J Jones', 'Brittney J Sandifer', 'Ahriea S Davis', 'Adam I Marcus', 'Cimona V Hinton']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Agonist-induced CXCR4 and CB2 Heterodimerization Inhibits Gα13/RhoA-mediated Migration.', 'Crosstalk between chemokine receptor CXCR4 and cannabinoid receptor CB2 in modulating breast cancer growth and invasion.', 'Cannabinoid receptor CB2 modulates the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis of T lymphocytes.', 'G protein-coupled receptor crosstalk and signaling in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.', 'Biological/pathological functions of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axes in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer.', 'Should oncologists trust cannabinoids?', '2-Arachidonoylglycerol Modulates CXCL12-Mediated Chemotaxis in Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.', 'Identification of Novel CB2 Ligands through Virtual Screening and In Vitro Evaluation.', 'The Role of Cannabinoids in CNS Development: Focus on Proliferation and Cell Death.', 'Probing GPCR Dimerization Using Peptides.']"""

Interaction between the Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of tumor cells with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes leads to inactivation of these immune effectors and, consequently, immune escape. Here we show that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis also leads to tumor cell resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Using a panel of PD-L1-expressing human and mouse breast and prostate cancer cell lines, we found that incubation of breast and prostate cancer cells in the presence of purified recombinant PD-1 resulted in resistance to doxorubicin and docetaxel as determined using clonogenic survival assays. Co-culture with PD-1-expressing Jurkat T cells also promoted chemoresistance and this was prevented by antibody blockade of either PD-L1 or PD-1 or by silencing of the PD-L1 gene. Moreover, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis using anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced doxorubicin chemotherapy to inhibit metastasis in a syngeneic mammary orthotopic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. To further investigate the mechanism of tumor cell survival advantage upon PD-L1 ligation, we show that exposure to rPD-1 promoted ERK and mTOR growth and survival pathways leading to increased cell proliferation.

This phase Ib study assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when administered with enzalutamide as first-line systemic chemotherapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Experimental methods:   Docetaxel-naïve patients received 21-day cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)). Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) was administered daily starting on day 2 of cycle 1. Patients were allowed to stop and restart docetaxel at any time following cycle 2. Treatment continued indefinitely until unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation due to investigator or patient preference.  Results:   A total of 22 patients received docetaxel, of whom 21 also received enzalutamide. Docetaxel was administered for a median of 5.0 cycles and enzalutamide for a median of 12.0 months. With concomitant treatment, geometric mean docetaxel exposure decreased by 11.8%, whereas peak concentrations decreased by 3.7% relative to docetaxel alone. The most common toxicities observed during the period of concomitant therapy were neutropenia (86.4%) and fatigue (77.3%). Common toxicities observed with post-docetaxel enzalutamide were constipation (23.8%), decreased appetite (19.0%), fatigue (19.0%), and musculoskeletal pain (19.0%). Treatment with enzalutamide and docetaxel resulted in prostate-specific antigen decreases in almost all patients based on exploratory analysis of available baseline and on-study prostate-specific antigen data.  Conclusions:   The combination of docetaxel and enzalutamide is feasible, although higher rates of neutropenia and neutropenic fever than anticipated were observed. Reductions in docetaxel exposure with enzalutamide coadministration were not considered clinically meaningful. This combination warrants further study in a larger mCRPC population.

Patients and methods:   Using the Hospital Episodes Statistics database, which contains all the information about National Health Service (NHS) and NHS-funded hospital admissions in England, for the years 2004-2008, 8 902 patients were found to have had prostate cancer and an admission to hospital with a fracture. Of these patients, 3 372 (37.8%) were identified as being treated with ADT, whilst 5 530 (62.2%) were not. There was a total of 228 852 admissions in the background population.  Results:   The risk of a fracture requiring hospitalisation increased from 1.12 to 1.41 per 100 person-years in a man with prostate cancer treated with ADT compared with those without ADT, an absolute increase of only 0.29 per 100 person-years. When compared with the background population, there was an increase from 0.58 to 1.41 per 100 person-years, a relative rate ratio increase of 2.4 (P < 0.01) with an absolute increase of 0.83 per 100 person-years.  Conclusion:   In England there was a small but statistically significant increased risk of fracture in men who had been treated with ADT. Men with prostate cancer, with or without ADT, were at an increased risk of fracture compared with the background population. We therefore suggest that if bone health is to be taken seriously in men with prostate cancer that all these men should be risk assessed (FRAX(®) or Qfracture(®) tools, as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advised), as all men with prostate cancer have an increased risk of fracture, with those on ADT having slightly higher risk.""","""['Edward R Jefferies', 'Amit Bahl', 'Luke Hounsome', 'Maike F Eylert', 'Julia Verne', 'Raj A Persad;PHONIC collaborative']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Bone health management in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation increases the risk of fracture in prostate cancer patients: a population-based study in Chinese patients.', 'Risk of fracture in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy: a population-based cohort study in New Zealand.', 'Androgen-deprivation-therapy-induced fractures in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer: what do we really know?', 'Prostate cancer, osteoporosis and fracture risk.', 'Harnessing the potential of therapeutic agents to safeguard bone health in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In the study, 99 consecutive men with clinical suspicion of PCa in a prospective controlled trial (IMPROD, NCT01864135) were included. In addition to 12-core systematic and MRI-targeted biopsies, cores from normal-appearing prostate areas, based on clinical examination, ultrasound, and biparametric prostate MRI, were obtained. The RNA transcript levels of ACSM1, AMACR, CACNA1D, DLX1, KLK3, PCA3, PLA2G7, RHOU, SPINK1, SPON2, TMPRSS2-ERG, and TDRD1 were measured with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Of the 99 men, 69 were diagnosed with PCa, 31 with primary Gleason pattern 3 and 38 with primary Gleason 4 or 5. TDRD1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were 1.3 times higher (P = 0.029) and the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG mRNAs more frequent in biopsies from men diagnosed with PCa (27/69, 39%) than in men without (5/30, 16%) (P = 0.035). The 2 markers identified aggressive PCa defined as Gleason sum≥7 at biopsy: median TDRD1 mRNA level was 1.4 higher (P = 0.005) and TMPRSS2-ERG expression more frequent (P<0.001) in high-grade cancer. A multivariate analysis of mRNA expression of 11 candidate genes combined with KLK3, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage-free PSA, and prostate volume improved the discrimination between aggressive and nonaggressive PCa (area under the curve = 0.77) compared with the use of the candidate genes or clinical parameters alone. However, serum PSA, percentage-free PSA, and prostate volume resulted in the best discrimination between non-organ-confined PCa (T3) from organ-confined PCa (T2) and healthy prostate (area under the curve = 0.86).

Although aberrant kinase activation has been proposed as a mechanism of castration resistance, comprehensive kinase profiles in CRPC remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the kinome in CRPC as well as the role of key molecules.  Methods:   We utilized a kinome array in androgen-dependent LNCaP and castration-resistant CxR cells. The effect of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) on androgen receptor (AR) expression was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The association between polymorphisms in the YB-1 gene determined by genotyping and YB-1 expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer tissues, as well as outcome in metastatic prostate cancer, were investigated by the Cochran-Armitage test and the Cox proportional hazards model, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   One hundred fifty-six of 180 kinase phosphorylation sites, including ERK and RSK, were activated in CRPC cells, leading to increased phosphorylation of YB-1, which is a key molecule in the progression to CRPC. YB-1 signaling regulated AR V7 expression, and YB-1 inhibition augmented the anticancer effect of enzalutamide. Moreover, polymorphism (rs12030724) in the YB-1 gene affected YB-1 expression in 93 prostate cancer tissues (YB-1 positive rate; 14.3% in TT, 40.0% in AT, and 52.9% in AA, P = .04) and associated with probability of progression in 104 metastatic prostate cancer case patients (AT/TT vs AA, hazard ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval = 0.32 to 0.77, P = .001).  Conclusions:   YB-1 appears to be a promising target to inhibit the development of castration resistance, even at the AR variant-expressing stage.

Results:   There was a significant increase in SDS scores from before to during HT. High depression score before HT was a significant predictor of later increases in depression during HT. Increases in depressive symptoms were restricted to 8 of the 20 SDS symptoms, the most powerful change being in sexual anhedonia, which was a result of decreased ability to perform during sexual activity.  Conclusions:   The association between HT and elevated depression is confirmed, but the relative influence of sexual anhedonia over other depressive symptoms expands the understanding of this association.

The combination of docetaxel and prednisone was the first treatment shown to prolong survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Since the approval of docetaxel in 2004, additional treatments are available, including abiraterone, which is also administered with prednisone. Therefore, patients are increasingly likely to have prednisone therapy several times throughout their disease course, and the contribution of prednisone to the efficacy of docetaxel is unknown.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of patients with mCPRC treated with docetaxel at our institution between 2004 and 2014. Patients were divided into two cohorts based upon whether prednisone was co-administered with docetaxel. Cohorts were further stratified based upon prior prednisone (with abiraterone) or hydrocortisone (with ketoconazole) use. The primary end point was clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end points were >50% PSA response rate and PSA progression-free survival (PSA PFS). A multivariable Cox regression model was constructed to determine whether prednisone use was independently predictive of PFS.  Results:   We identified 200 consecutive patients for inclusion in the study: 131 men received docetaxel with prednisone and 69 received docetaxel alone. The docetaxel-prednisone cohort had superior PFS compared with the docetaxel-alone cohort (median PFS: 7.8 vs. 6.2 months, HR 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.97), P=0.03). Prednisone use was associated with a reduced risk of progression on docetaxel in the propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox model (P=0.002). Among abiraterone- or ketoconazole-pretreated patients, no difference in PFS was observed between prednisone-containing and non-prednisone-containing docetaxel regimens (median PFS: 7.1 vs. 6.3 months, HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.59-1.57), P=0.87).  Conclusions:   The incorporation of prednisone potentially augments the efficacy of docetaxel in patients with mCRPC.

The aim of our study was to assess the influence of non-surgically related causes of ED in patients treated with BNSRP.  Methods:   Overall, 716 patients treated with BNSRP were retrospectively identified. All patients had complete data on erectile function (EF) assessed by the Index of Erectile Function-EF domain (IIEF-EF) and depressive status assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) questionnaire. EF recovery was defined as an IIEF-EF of ⩾22. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed the impact of preoperative IIEF-EF, depression and adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) on the time to EF recovery. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the impact of aRT on EF recovery after accounting for depression and baseline IIEF-EF.  Results:   Median follow-up was 48 months. Patients with a preoperative IIEF-EF of ⩾22 had substantially higher EF recovery rates compared with those with a lower IIEF-EF (P<0.001). Patients with a CES-D of <16 had significantly higher EF recovery rates compared to those with depression (60.8 vs 49.2%; P=0.03). Patients receiving postoperative aRT had lower rates of EF compared with their counterparts left untreated after surgery (40.7 vs 59.8%; P<0.001). These results were confirmed in multivariable analyses, where preoperative IIEF-EF (P<0.001), depression (P=0.04) and aRT (P=0.03) were confirmed as significant predictors of EF recovery.  Conclusions:   Preoperative functional status and depression should be considered when counseling PCa patients regarding the long-term side effects of BNSRP.

Recently, we demonstrated that the SRD5A2 polymorphism was associated with metastatic prostate cancer prognosis. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the relationship between ADT serum testosterone levels or body mass index (BMI) and the prognosis among men treated with primary ADT for metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, we examined the association of serum testosterone levels during ADT with the SRD5A2 polymorphism.  Methods:   This study included 96 Japanese patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The relationship between clinicopathological parameters, including serum testosterone levels during ADT and BMI, and progression-free survival, overall survival and survival from progression following primary ADT treatment for metastatic prostate cancer was examined. Additionally, the association between the SRD5A2 gene polymorphism (rs523349) and serum testosterone levels during ADT was examined in 86 cases.  Results:   Among clinicopathological parameters, the lowest quartile of serum testosterone levels during ADT was a significant predictor of better overall survival as well as survival from castration resistance. However, BMI was not associated with prognosis. The CC allele in the SRD5A2 gene (rs523349), encoding the less active 5α-reductase, was associated with lower serum testosterone levels during ADT.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these findings revealed a dramatic suppression of serum testosterone by ADT was associated with better survival among men with metastatic prostate cancer that have undergone primary ADT, which may be affected by the SRD5A2 gene polymorphism.""","""['M Shiota', 'N Fujimoto', 'A Yokomizo', 'A Takeuchi', 'E Kashiwagi', 'T Dejima', 'K Kiyoshima', 'J Inokuchi', 'K Tatsugami', 'M Eto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['SRD5A gene polymorphism in Japanese men predicts prognosis of metastatic prostate cancer with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Prognostic Impact of Serum Testosterone and Body Mass Index Before Androgen-deprivation Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic Polymorphism in Sex Hormone-binding Globulin With a Prognosis of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Among Japanese Men.', 'Testosterone in prostate cancer: the Bethesda consensus.', 'Serum testosterone levels after medical or surgical androgen deprivation: a comprehensive review of the literature.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Circulating and Intratumoral Adrenal Androgens Correlate with Response to Abiraterone in Men with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene polymorphism-related differences in the outcomes of abiraterone for prostate cancer: a systematic overview.', 'Epidemiology and genomics of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'Steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 enzyme variants, biomass exposure and tobacco use in Mexican patients with prostate cancer.']"""

We performed a lymphatic mapping study and determined the value of fluorescence SLN detection with indocyanine green (ICG) for the detection of lymph node metastases in intermediate- and high-risk patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. A total of 42 patients received systematic or specific ICG injections into the prostate base, the midportion, the apex, the left lobe, or the right lobe. We found (1) that external and internal iliac regions encompass the majority of SLNs, (2) that common iliac regions contain up to 22% of all SLNs, (3) that a prostatic lobe can drain into the contralateral group of pelvic lymph nodes, and (4) that the fossa of Marcille also receives significant drainage. Among the 12 patients who received systematic ICG injections, 5 (42%) had a total of 29 lymph node metastases. Of these, 16 nodes were ICG positive, yielding 55% sensitivity. The complex drainage pattern of the prostate and the low sensitivity of ICG for the detection of lymph node metastases reported in our study highlight the difficulties related to the implementation of SNL techniques in prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   There is controversy about how extensive lymph node dissection (LND) should be during prostatectomy. We investigated the lymphatic drainage of the prostate and whether sentinel node fluorescence techniques would be useful to detect node metastases. We found that the drainage pattern is complex and that the sentinel node technique is not able to replace extended pelvic LND.""","""['Daniel P Nguyen', 'Philipp M Huber', 'Tobias A Metzger', 'Vera Genitsch', 'Hans H Schudel', 'George N Thalmann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Sentinel Lymph Node Concept and Novel Approaches in Detecting Lymph Node Metastasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging for Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes and Lymphatic Vessels during Open Prostatectomy using Indocyanine Green.', 'Indocyanine Green Guided Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: An Efficient Technique to Classify the Lymph Node Status of Patients with Prostate Cancer Who Underwent Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging of lymph nodes during robotic-assisted laparoscopic operation for endometrial cancer.

From its early days until becoming a prostate cancer biomarker""","""Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been since the mid 80's the most commonly used biomarker for measuring current and future risk of prostate cancer, for its early detection and to measure response to treatments and detecting recurrence in all stages of the disease. PSA's early development came along with progress in the field of immunology, which allowed detection and study of antigens from different tissues and fluids when injecting them into rabbits to promote immune response. Rubin Flocks in 1960 was the first to investigate and discover prostate-specific antigens in benign and malignant tissue. Some years later, Hara, a Japanese forensic investigator, found 'gamma seminoprotein', that he used to detect human semen in rape cases. However, his work published in Japanese did not reach the Englishspeaking scientific community. In 1970 Ablin discovered both in prostatic fluid and tissue what he called ""prostate-specific antigen"", but he didn't characterize or describe it. Investigators Li and Beling, and Sensabaugh, approached the current PSA, but they were limited by available technology at that time. Dr T Ming Chu led a research team on prostate cancer in New York, USA and published their results in 1979. He finally received the patent for the discovery of ""human purified prostate antigen"" in 1984. Due to this work, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in USA, approved the use of PSA for monitoring recurrence after treatment. It was later known that PSA was not prostate-specific since it was produced in other tissues and fluids, but it was recognized that it was human species-specific. Works by Papsidero and Stamey showed new indications and utilities for PSA, but it was Catalona who first used it as a marker for prostate cancer in 1991. Thanks to these advances FDA authorized in 1994 the clinical use of PSA for early detection of prostate cancer.""","""['T Dellavedova']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['The discovery of prostate-specific antigen.', 'The role of PSA in diagnosis of prostate cancer and its recurrence.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics in localized and advanced prostate cancer.', 'Serum markers for early detection and staging of prostate cancer.

Methods:   The study analyzed the operative, perioperative, and oncologic outcomes for all patients who underwent robot-assisted extended rectal cancer surgery from April 2009 to February 2015.  Results:   Of 36 patients, 22 underwent multivisceral en bloc resection, and 18 underwent extramesorectal lymph node (EMRLN) dissection. The median tumor location was 5 cm [interquartile range (IQR), 2.2-9.0 cm] from the anal verge. A total of 32 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The median body mass index of the patients was 26.8 kg/m(2) (IQR, 24.0-31.9 kg/m(2)). Conversion was required for one patient because of inability to tolerate the Trendelenburg position. All the resections were R0, and there were no incomplete TMEs. The vagina and prostate or periprostatic structures were the most commonly resected (n = 13/22), and the lateral pelvic nodes were the most common EMRLNs (n = 16/18). The median numbers of examined mesorectal lymph nodes and EMRLNs were respectively 20 (IQR, 18.0-28.0) and 2.5 (IQR, 1.0-6.0). The median hospital stay was 4 days (IQR, 3.0-5.5 days).

Here we have developed a new and improved multiplex mRNA urine test to detect prostate cancer (PCa). Furthermore, we have validated the PCA3 urinary transcript and some panels of urinary transcripts previously reported as useful diagnostic biomarkers for PCa in our cohort.  Methods:   Post-prostatic massage urine samples were prospectively collected from PCa patients and controls. Expression levels of 42 target genes selected from our previous studies and from the literature were studied in 224 post-prostatic massage urine sediments by quantitative PCR. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify individual PCa predictors. A variable selection method was used to develop a multiplex biomarker model. Discrimination was measured by ROC curve AUC for both, our model and the previously published biomarkers.  Results:   Seven of the 42 genes evaluated (PCA3, ELF3, HIST1H2BG, MYO6, GALNT3, PHF12 and GDF15) were found to be independent predictors for discriminating patients with PCa from controls. We developed a four-gene expression signature (HIST1H2BG, SPP1, ELF3 and PCA3) with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 67% (AUC = 0.763) for discriminating between tumor and control urines. The accuracy of PCA3 and previously reported panels of biomarkers is roughly maintained in our cohort.  Conclusions:   Our four-gene expression signature outperforms PCA3 as well as previously reported panels of biomarkers to predict PCa risk. This study suggests that a urinary biomarker panel could improve PCa detection.

Although the molecular mechanisms for this correlation has not yet been elucidated, the primary function of LL-37 as a chemotactic molecule for innate immune effector cells suggests its possible association in coordinating protumorigenic mechanisms, mediated by tumor-infiltrating immune cells.  Methods:   To investigate protumorigenic role(s) of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), a murine orthologue of LL-37, the present study compared tumor growth kinetics between mouse PCa cell lines with and without CRAMP expression (TRAMP-C1 and TRAMP-C1(CRAMP-sh) , respectively) in immunocompetent mice. CRAMP-mediated chemotaxis of different innate immune cell types to the tumor microenvironment (TME) was observed in vivo and confirmed by in vitro chemotaxis assay. The role of CRAMP in differentiation and polarization of immature myeloid progenitors (IMPs) to protumorigenic type 2 macrophages (M2) in TME was determined by adoptive transfer of IMPs into mice bearing CRAMP(+) and CRAMP(-) tumors. To differentiate protumorigenic events mediated by tumor-derived CRAMP from host immune cell-derived CRAMP, tumor challenge study was performed in CRAMP-deficient mice. To identify mechanisms of CRAMP function, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) gene expression was analyzed by QRT-PCR and STAT3 signaling was determined by immunoblotting.  Results:   Significantly delayed tumor growth was observed in wild-type (WT) mice implanted with TRAMP-C1(CRAMP-sh) cells compared to mice implanted with TRAMP-C1 cells. CRAMP(+) TME induced increased number of IMP differentiation into protumorigenic M2 macrophages compared to CRAMP(-) TME, indicating tumor-derived CRAMP facilitates differentiation and polarization of IMPs toward M2. Tumor challenge study in CRAMP deficient mice showed comparable tumor growth kinetics with WT mice, suggesting tumor-derived CRAMP plays a crucial role in PCa progression. In vitro study demonstrated that overexpressed M-CSF and MCP-1 in TRAMP-C1 cells through CRAMP-mediated autocrine signaling, involving p65, regulates IMP-to-M2 differentiation/polarization through STAT3 activation.  Conclusion:   Altogether, the present study suggests that overexpressed CRAMP in prostate tumor initially chemoattracts IMPs to TME and mediates differentiation and polarization of early myeloid progenitors into protumorigenic M2 macrophages during PCa progression. Thus, selective downregulation of CRAMP in tumor cells in situ may benefit overcoming immunosuppressive mechanisms in PCa.""","""['Ha-Ram Cha', 'Joo Hyoung Lee', 'Jonathan A Hensel', 'Anandi B Sawant', 'Brittney H Davis', 'Carnellia M Lee', 'Jessy S Deshane', 'Selvarangan Ponnazhagan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['LL-37 as a therapeutic target for late stage prostate cancer.', 'Mouse cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide chemoattracts leukocytes using formyl peptide receptor-like 1/mouse formyl peptide receptor-like 2 as the receptor and acts as an immune adjuvant.', 'Expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in myeloid cells is required for lung tumor growth.', 'The Critical Role of the Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37/ CRAMP in Protection of Colon Microbiota Balance, Mucosal Homeostasis, Anti-Inflammatory Responses, and Resistance to Carcinogenesis.', 'More Than Just Attractive: How CCL2 Influences Myeloid Cell Behavior Beyond Chemotaxis.', 'Developmental and homeostatic signaling transmitted by the G-protein coupled receptor FPR2.', 'Meta-Analytic Comparison of Global RNA Transcriptomes of Acute and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Cells Reveals Novel Gene Candidates Governing Myeloid Malignancies.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Renovation as innovation: Repurposing human antibacterial peptide LL-37 for cancer therapy.', 'Recent Advances on the Role of ATGL in Cancer.']"""

The etiology and molecular basis for this 'alternative' treatment-resistant cell state remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data of metastatic biopsies from patients, we observed substantial genomic overlap between castration-resistant tumors that were histologically characterized as prostate adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE); analysis of biopsy samples from the same individuals over time points to a model most consistent with divergent clonal evolution. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed marked epigenetic differences between CRPC-NE tumors and CRPC-Adeno, and also designated samples of CRPC-Adeno with clinical features of AR independence as CRPC-NE, suggesting that epigenetic modifiers may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of this treatment-resistant state.

AR signalling mediates the expression of androgen-responsive genes, which are involved in prostate cancer development and progression. Our previous chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that the region of abhydrolase domain containing 2 (ABHD2) includes a functional androgen receptor binding site. In this study, we demonstrated that ABHD2 is a novel androgen-responsive gene that is overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissues.  Methods:   The expression levels of ABHD2 in androgen-sensitive cells were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western-blot analyses. LNCaP and VCaP cells with ABHD2 overexpression or short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown were used for functional analyses. ABHD2 expression was examined in clinical samples of prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We showed that ABHD2 expression is increased by androgen in LNCaP and VCaP cells. This androgen-induced ABHD2 expression was diminished by bicalutamide. While stable expression of ABHD2 affected the enhancement of LNCaP cell proliferation and migration, siRNA-mediated ABHD2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and migration. In addition, the siRNA treatment significantly repressed the tumour growth derived from LNCaP cells in athymic mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of ABHD2 expression in tumour specimens showed a positive correlation of ABHD2 immunoreactivity with high Gleason score and pathological N stage. Moreover, patients with high immunoreactivity of ABHD2 showed low cancer-specific survival rates and a resistance to docetaxel-based chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   ABHD2 is a novel androgen-regulated gene that can promote prostate cancer growth and resistance to chemotherapy, and is a novel target for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Daisuke Obinata', 'Shogo Takada', 'Ken-ichi Takayama', 'Tomohiko Urano', 'Akiko Ito', 'Daisaku Ashikari', 'Kyoko Fujiwara', 'Yuta Yamada', 'Taro Murata', 'Jinpei Kumagai', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Kazuhiro Ikeda', 'Kuniko Horie-Inoue', 'Yukio Homma', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent regulation of Bcl-xL expression: Implication in prostate cancer progression.', '14-3-3ζ, a novel androgen-responsive gene, is upregulated in prostate cancer and promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival.', 'New features in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Structure and function of FUS gene in prostate cancer.', 'A comparative mRNA- and miRNA transcriptomics reveals novel molecular signatures associated with metastatic prostate cancers.', 'Radiometric Assay of ABHD2 Activity.', 'TDP-43 upregulates lipid metabolism modulator ABHD2 to suppress apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'OCT1-target neural gene PFN2 promotes tumor growth in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Gain of GAS5 reveals worse prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset.']"""

Methods and materials:   Data on 475 high-risk prostate cancer patients were examined. Sixty-one consecutive patients received pelvic SN-based IMRT (5 × 1.8 Gy/wk to 50.4 Gy [pelvic nodes + individual SN] and an integrated boost with 5 × 2.0 Gy/wk to 70.0 Gy to prostate + [base of] seminal vesicles) and neo-/adjuvant long-term androgen deprivation therapy; 414 patients after SN-pelvic lymph node dissection were used to calculate the expected nodal involvement rate for the radiation therapy sample. Biochemical control and overall survival were estimated for the SN-IMRT patients using the Kaplan-Meier method. The expected frequency of nodal involvement in the radiation therapy group was estimated by imputing frequencies of node-positive patients in the surgical sample to the pattern of Gleason, prostate-specific antigen, and T category in the radiation therapy sample.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 61 months, 5-year OS after SN-guided IMRT reached 84.4%. Biochemical control according to the Phoenix definition was 73.8%.

As such, criteria that identify a subpopulation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk prostate cancer patients who are at very high risk (VHR) for poor survival outcomes following prostatectomy were recently developed at our institution and include the presence of any of the following disease characteristics: multiple NCCN high-risk factors, primary Gleason pattern 5 disease and/or ≥5 biopsy cores with Gleason sums of 8 to 10. Whether these criteria also apply to men undergoing definitive radiation is unclear, as is the optimal treatment regimen in these patients.  Methods and materials:   All men consecutively treated with definitive radiation by a single provider from 1993 to 2006 and who fulfilled criteria for NCCN high-risk disease were identified (n=288), including 99 patients (34%) with VHR disease. Multivariate-adjusted competing risk regression models were constructed to assess associations between the VHR definition and biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis assessed the association of the VHR definition with overall mortality (OM). Cumulative incidences of failure endpoints were compared between VHR men and other NCCN high-risk men.  Results:   Men with VHR disease compared to other NCCN high-risk men experienced a higher 10-year incidence of BF (54.0% vs 35.4%, respectively, P<.001), DM (34.9% vs 13.4%, respectively, P<.001), PCSM (18.5% vs 5.9%, respectively, P<.001), and OM (36.4% vs 27.0%, respectively, P=.04). VHR men with a detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration at the end of radiation (EOR) remained at high risk of 10-year PCSM compared to VHR men with an undetectable EOR PSA (31.0% vs 13.7%, respectively, P=.05).  Conclusions:   NCCN high-risk prostate cancer patients who meet VHR criteria experience distinctly worse outcomes following definitive radiation and long-term androgen deprivation therapy, particularly if an EOR PSA is detectable. Optimal use of local therapies for VHR patients should be explored further, as should novel agents.""","""['Amol K Narang', 'Carol Gergis', 'Scott P Robertson', 'Pei He', 'Ashwin N Ram', 'Todd R McNutt', 'Emily Griffith', 'Theodore A DeWeese', 'Stephanie Honig', 'Harleen Singh', 'Danny Y Song', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Theodore L DeWeese']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['End-of-radiation PSA as a novel prognostic factor in patients undergoing definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Classifying high-risk versus very high-risk prostate cancer: is it relevant to outcomes of conformal radiotherapy and androgen deprivation?', 'Unification of favourable intermediate-, unfavourable intermediate-, and very high-risk stratification criteria for prostate cancer.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Long-Term Outcomes of a Phase I Trial of Weekly Docetaxel, Total Androgen Blockade, and Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized High-Risk Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Clinically Localized Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Lack of Benefit in Patients with Very High-Risk Factors T3b-4 and/or Gleason 9-10.', 'Comparison of Clinical Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy versus IMRT with Long-Term Hormone Therapy for Relatively Young Patients with High- to Very High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Novel Prognostic Index of High-Risk Prostate Cancer Using Simple Summation of Very High-Risk Factors.']"""

However little is known about the experience of gay and bisexual (GB) men.  Aim:   HRQOL and psychosexual predictors of HRQOL were examined in GB and heterosexual men with PCa to inform targeted health information and support.  Method:   One hundred twenty-four GB and 225 heterosexual men with PCa completed a range of validated psychosexual instruments.  Main outcome measure:   Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) was used to measure HRQOL, with validated psychosexual measures, and demographic and treatment variables used as predictors.  Results:   GB men were significantly younger (64.25 years) than heterosexual men (71.54 years), less likely to be in an ongoing relationship, and more likely to have casual sexual partners. Compared with age-matched population norms, participants in both groups reported significantly lower sexual functioning and HRQOL, increased psychological distress, disruptions to dyadic sexual communication, and lower masculine self-esteem, sexual confidence, and sexual intimacy. In comparison with heterosexual men, GB men reported significantly lower HRQOL (P = .046), masculine self-esteem (P < .001), and satisfaction with treatment (P = .013); higher psychological distress (P = .005), cancer related distress (P < .001) and ejaculatory concern (P < .001); and higher sexual functioning (P < .001) and sexual confidence (P = .001). In regression analysis, psychological distress, cancer-related distress, masculine self-esteem, and satisfaction with treatment were predictors of HRQOL for GB men (R2Adj = .804); psychological distress and sexual confidence were predictors for heterosexual men (R2Adj = .690).  Conclusion:   These findings confirm differences between GB and heterosexual men in the impact of PCa on HRQOL across a range of domains, suggesting there is a need for GB targeted PCa information and support, to address the concerns of this ""hidden population"" in PCa care.""","""['Jane M Ussher', 'Janette Perz', 'Andrew Kellett', 'Suzanne Chambers', 'David Latini', 'Ian D Davis', 'Duncan Rose', 'Gary W Dowsett', 'Scott Williams']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Threat of Sexual Disqualification: The Consequences of Erectile Dysfunction and Other Sexual Changes for Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of Prostate Cancer Treatment on the Sexual Quality of Life for Men-Who-Have-Sex-with-Men.', ""Let's talk about gay sex: gay and bisexual men's sexual communication with healthcare professionals after prostate cancer."", 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.', 'Sexual problems in homo- and bisexual men - the context of the issue.', 'Editorial: Cancer prevention, treatment and survivorship in the LGBTQIA community.', '""Ultimately, You Realize You\'re on Your Own"": The Impact of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men Couples.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Development of a Training to Address Needs of Sexual and Gender Minority Prostate Cancer Survivors: Results of Formative Research.', 'Prostate Cancer in Sexual Minorities: Epidemiology, Screening and Diagnosis, Treatment, and Quality of Life.']"""

Cultured DU145 cells were treated pharmacologically with telmisartan and GSK0660 (a PPAR-delta antagonist); or by RNA interference with siRNA of PPAR-delta. The treatment effects on cell survival were evaluated with cell viability assay, life and dead cell staining and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis for PPAR-delta protein expression was also performed. The results showed that telmisartan (0-80 µm) dose-dependently reduced DU145 cell survival. Flow cytometry demonstrated cancer cell cycle arrest with increase of sub-G1 phase. GSK0660 partially but significantly restored the telmisartan-treated cell viability. Similarly, siRNA of PPAR-delta significantly reversed the telmisartan-induced apoptosis. Western blot showed that telmisartan significantly increased DU145 cell PPAR-delta protein expression. Co-incubation with siRNA of PPAR-delta inhibited the telmisartan effect of PPAR-delta up-regulation. In conclusion, telmisartan induces prostate cancer DU145 cells apoptosis through the up-regulation of PPAR-delta protein expression. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of PPAR-delta activity can both reverse the telmisartan-induced apoptotic effect.

Here, we report an injectable nanoparticle-based internal radiation source that potentially offers more efficacious treatment of unresectable solid tumors without significant adverse side effects. Using a highly efficient incorporation procedure, palladium-103, a brachytherapy radioisotope in clinical practice, was coated to monodispersed hollow gold nanoparticles with a diameter about 120 nm, to form (103)Pd@Au nanoseeds. The therapeutic efficacy of (103)Pd@Au nanoseeds were assessed when intratumorally injected into a prostate cancer xenograft model. Five weeks after a single-dose treatment, a significant tumor burden reduction (>80%) was observed without noticeable side effects on the liver, spleen and other organs. Impressively, >95% nanoseeds were retained inside the tumors as monitored by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with the gamma emissions of (103)Pd.

Docetaxel 75mg/m2 + AA 1000mg + P 10mg was deemed the RP2D, with DLT in one of six patients. PSA declines from baseline of ≥50% and ≥90% were observed for 85.7% and 66.7% of patients, respectively. During median follow-up of 14.5 mo, eight patients had PSA progression and six had radiographic progression or died. Systemic exposure was comparable for docetaxel and abiraterone when given alone or in combination. Studies are ongoing to confirm the efficacy of potent androgen receptor-targeted therapy plus taxane in early mCRPC.  Patient summary:   The combination of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in men with metastatic prostate cancer. This study demonstrates the ability to combine the hormonal therapy agent abiraterone acetate, plus prednisone, and the chemotherapy drug docetaxel with an acceptable side effect profile. A high rate of prostate-specific antigen decline was seen, but the study was small and additional research is needed before this becomes a standard approach.""","""['Scott T Tagawa', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Justine Bruce', 'Emerson A Lim', 'Daniel P Petrylak', 'Weimin Peng', 'Thian Kheoh', 'Scott Maul', 'Johan W Smit', 'Martha D Gonzalez', 'Peter De Porre', 'NamPhuong Tran', 'David M Nanus']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Improving Survival for Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer: Will Combination Therapy Help Us To Move Forward?', 'Prior Endocrine Therapy Impact on Abiraterone Acetate Clinical Efficacy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post-hoc Analysis of Randomised Phase 3 Studies.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Clinical Outcomes from Androgen Signaling-directed Therapy after Treatment with Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Neutropenia and docetaxel exposure in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: A meta-analysis and evaluation of a clinical cohort.', 'Collateral resistance to taxanes in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer through aberrant androgen receptor and its variants.', 'Androgen receptor reverts dexamethasone‑induced inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.']"""

Numerous GSA methods have been proposed to assess the enrichment of sets of genes. However, most methods are developed with respect to a specific alternative scenario, such as a differential mean pattern or a differential coexpression. Moreover, a very limited number of methods can handle either binary, categorical, or continuous phenotypes. In this paper, we develop two novel GSA tests, called SDRs, based on the sufficient dimension reduction technique, which aims to capture sufficient information about the relationship between genes and the phenotype. The advantages of our proposed methods are that they allow for categorical and continuous phenotypes, and they are also able to identify a variety of enriched gene sets.  Results:   Through simulation studies, we compared the type I error and power of SDRs with existing GSA methods for binary, triple, and continuous phenotypes. We found that SDR methods adequately control the type I error rate at the pre-specified nominal level, and they have a satisfactory power to detect gene sets with differential coexpression and to test non-linear associations between gene sets and a continuous phenotype. In addition, the SDR methods were compared with seven widely-used GSA methods using two real microarray datasets for illustration.  Conclusions:   We concluded that the SDR methods outperform the others because of their flexibility with regard to handling different kinds of phenotypes and their power to detect a wide range of alternative scenarios. Our real data analysis highlights the differences between GSA methods for detecting enriched gene sets.""","""['Huey-Miin Hsueh', 'Chen-An Tsai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Linear combination test for gene set analysis of a continuous phenotype.', 'Extracting the Strongest Signals from Omics Data: Differentially Expressed Pathways and Beyond.', 'Comparative study of gene set enrichment methods.', 'Gene-set analysis and reduction.', 'Microarrays--identifying molecular portraits for prostate tumors with different Gleason patterns.', 'Fifteen Years of Gene Set Analysis for High-Throughput Genomic Data: A Review of Statistical Approaches and Future Challenges.', 'Unsupervised gene set testing based on random matrix theory.']"""

Although reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) occurs following androgen deprivation, the precise mechanism involved is unclear. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase, RON alters mechanical properties of cells to influence epithelial to mesenchymal transition and functions as a transcription factor to differentially regulate AR signaling. RON inhibits AR activation and subset of AR-regulated transcripts in androgen responsive LNCaP cells. However in C4-2B, a castrate-resistant sub-line of LNCaP and AR-negative androgen independent DU145 cells, RON activates subset of AR-regulated transcripts. Expression of AR in PC-3 cells leads to activation of RON under androgen deprivation but not under androgen proficient conditions implicating a role for RON in androgen independence. Consistently, RON expression is significantly elevated in castrate resistant prostate tumors. Taken together our results suggest that RON activation could aid in promoting androgen independence and that inhibition of RON in combination with AR antagonist(s) merits serious consideration as a therapeutic option during hormone deprivation therapy.""","""['Izhar Batth', 'Huiyoung Yun', 'Suleman Hussain', 'Peng Meng', 'Pawel Osmulski', 'Tim Hui-Ming Huang', 'Roble Bedolla', 'Amanda Profit', 'Robert Reddick', 'Addanki Kumar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Tumor Cell Autonomous RON Receptor Expression Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth Under Conditions of Androgen Deprivation.', ""Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), more than a kinase: Role in castrate-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Reactivation of androgen receptor-regulated lipid biosynthesis drives the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'An Introduction and Overview of RON Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling.', 'The MST1R/RON Tyrosine Kinase in Cancer: Oncogenic Functions and Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Evidence for 2-Methoxyestradiol-Mediated Inhibition of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase RON in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Discovery of Cell-Surface Vimentin (CSV) as a Sarcoma Target and Development of CSV-Targeted IL12 Immune Therapy.', 'Microfluidic-Based Mechanical Phenotyping of Androgen-Sensitive and Non-sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells Lines.']"""

In this article, we focus on risks of injustice, and use a case study of robotic prostatectomy to identify features of surgical innovation that risk introducing or exacerbating injustices. Interpreting justice as encompassing matters of both efficiency and equity, we first examine questions relating to government decisions about whether to publicly fund access to innovative treatments. Here the case of robotic prostatectomy exemplifies the difficulty of accommodating healthcare priorities such as improving the health of marginalized groups. It also illustrates challenges with estimating the likely long-term costs and benefits of a new intervention, the difficulty of comparing outcomes of an innovative treatment to those of established treatments, and the further complexity associated with patient and surgeon preferences. Once the decision has been made to fund a new procedure, separate issues of justice arise at the level of providing care to individual patients. Here, the case of robotic prostatectomy exemplifies how features of surgical innovation, such as surgeon learning curves and the need for an adequate volume of cases at a treatment centre, can exacerbate injustices associated with treatment cost and the logistics of travelling for treatment. Drawing on our analysis, we conclude by making a number of recommendations for the just introduction of surgical innovations.""","""['Katrina Hutchison', 'Jane Johnson', 'Drew Carter']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Bioethics""","""['Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: recent advances.', 'Developing a successful robotics program.', 'Adding a newly trained surgeon into a high-volume robotic prostatectomy group: are outcomes compromised?', 'Reducing robotic prostatectomy costs by minimizing instrumentation.', 'Comparison of Perioperative and Early Oncologic Outcomes between Open and Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy in a Contemporary Population Based Cohort.']"""

Our goals here are, by using the same lineage-tracing reporter system, to track the dynamic changes of PSA-/lo and PSA+ cells upon castration in vitro, investigate the molecular changes accompanying persistent castration, and develop large numbers of PSA-/lo PCa cells for drug screening. To these ends, we treated LNCaP cells infected with the PSAP-GFP reporter with three regimens of castration, i.e., CDSS, CDSS plus bicalutamide, and MDV3100 continuously for up to ~21 months. We observed that in the first ~7 months, castration led to time-dependent increases in PSA-/lo cells, loss of AR and PSA expression, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and many other molecular changes. Meanwhile, castrated LNCaP cells became resistant to high concentrations of MDV3100, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other agents. However, targeted and medium-throughput library screening identified several kinase (e.g., IGF-1R, AKT, PI3K/mTOR, Syk, GSK3) inhibitors as well as the BCL2 inhibitor that could effectively sensitize the LNCaP-CRPC cells to killing. Of interest, LNCaP cells castrated for >7 months showed evidence of cyclic changes in AR and the mTOR/AKT signaling pathways potentially involving epigenetic mechanisms. These observations indicate that castration elicits numerous molecular changes and leads to enrichment of PSA-/lo PCa cells. The ability to generate large numbers of PSA-/lo PCa cells should allow future high-throughput screening to identify novel therapeutics that specifically target this population.""","""['Kiera Rycaj', 'Eun Jeong Cho', 'Xin Liu', 'Hsueh-Ping Chao', 'Bigang Liu', 'Qiuhui Li', 'Ashwini K Devkota', 'Dingxiao Zhang', 'Xin Chen', 'John Moore', 'Kevin N Dalby', 'Dean G Tang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['CH5137291, an androgen receptor nuclear translocation-inhibiting compound, inhibits the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Systematic dissection of phenotypic, functional, and tumorigenic heterogeneity of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Phage display screening identifies a prostate specific antigen (PSA)-/lo prostate cancer cell specific peptide to retard castration resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emerging cell cycle inhibitors for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer as a dedifferentiated organ: androgen receptor, cancer stem cells, and cancer stemness.', 'Unravelling Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity Using Spatial Approaches to Lipidomics and Transcriptomics.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Slow-cycling (dormant) cancer cells in therapy resistance, cancer relapse and metastasis.', 'LRIG1, a regulator of stem cell quiescence and a pleiotropic feedback tumor suppressor.']"""

Obese people are in a chronic inflammatory state with increased serum levels of IL-17, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). How these factors contribute to the chronic inflammatory status that promotes development of aggressive prostate cancer in obese men is largely unknown. We found that, in obese mice, hyperinsulinemia enhanced IL-17-induced expression of downstream proinflammatory genes with increased levels of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), resulting in development of more invasive prostate cancer. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) constitutively bound to and phosphorylated IL-17RA at T780, leading to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of IL-17RA, thus inhibiting IL-17-mediated inflammation. IL-17RA phosphorylation was reduced, while the IL-17RA levels were increased in the proliferative human prostate cancer cells compared to the normal cells. Insulin and IGF1 enhanced IL-17-induced inflammatory responses through suppressing GSK3, which was shown in the cultured cell lines in vitro and obese mouse models of prostate cancer in vivo.

This study examined whether the introduction of the payment method had an effect on radiation fractions administered when compared to clinical guidelines. The number of fractions of radiation therapy delivered to patients with bone metastases, breast, lung, prostate, and skin cancer was assessed for concordance with clinical guidelines. The proportion of guideline-based care ascertained from the payer's claims database was compared before (2011) and after (2013) the payment method introduction using relative risks (RR). After the introduction of case rates, there were no significant changes in guideline-based care in breast, lung, and skin cancer; however, patients with bone metastases and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to have received guideline-based care (RR = 2.0 and 1.1, respectively, p<0.05).

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HGF on EMT and invasive potential, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, in a human prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of HGF for varying durations. EMT-associated proteins, including E-cadherin and vimentin, were examined by western blot analysis. The effects of HGF on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity were assessed using MTT, wound-healing, Transwell and soft-agar assays. Subsequently, the role of c-Met in the mediation of EMT-like changes was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and gene knockdown by small interfering RNA. Finally, western blot analysis was used to quantify the expression of a downstream transcription factor and extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway proteins. The results indicated that treatment with HGF induced EMT-like changes and enhanced the invasive potential of PC-3 cells. There was an increase in the expression of ERK, phosphorylated-ERK and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox-1 (Zeb-1), suggesting that EMT-like changes may be mediated through the ERK/MAPK and Zeb-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, HGF-mediated EMT-like changes were associated with c-Met activation, and these changes were able to be blocked by c-Met knockdown.

Previously, we reported that fucosylated N-glycans on haptoglobin in the sera of patients with pancreatic cancer were increased by lectin-ELISA and mass spectrometry analyses. However, an increase in fucosylated haptoglobin has been reported in various types of cancer. To ascertain if characteristic fucosylation is observed in each cancer type, we undertook site-specific analyses of N-glycans on haptoglobin in the sera of patients with five types of operable gastroenterological cancer (esophageal, gastric, colon, gallbladder, pancreatic), a non-gastroenterological cancer (prostate cancer) and normal controls using ODS column LC-ESI MS. Haptoglobin has four potential glycosylation sites (Asn184, Asn207, Asn211, Asn241). In all cancer samples, monofucosylated N-glycans were significantly increased at all glycosylation sites. Moreover, difucosylated N-glycans were detected at Asn 184, Asn207 and Asn241 only in cancer samples. Remarkable differences in N-glycan structure among cancer types were not observed. We next analyzed N-glycan alditols released from haptoglobin using graphitized carbon column LC-ESI MS to identify the linkage of fucosylation. Lewis-type and core-type fucosylated N-glycans were increased in gastroenterological cancer samples, but only core-type fucosylated N-glycan was relatively increased in prostate cancer samples. In metastatic prostate cancer, Lewis-type fucosylated N-glycan was also increased.

Therefore, we report the toxicity and clinical outcomes after postprostatectomy hypofractionated RT.  Methods and materials:   From a prospectively maintained database, men receiving image guided hypofractionated intensity modulated RT (HIMRT) with 2.5-Gy fractions constituted our study population. Androgen deprivation therapy was used at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. Acute toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Late toxicities were scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scale. Biochemical recurrence was defined as an increase of 0.1 in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from posttreatment nadir or an increase in PSA despite treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the time-to-event outcomes.  Results:   Between April 2008 and April 2012, 56 men received postoperative HIMRT. The median follow-up time was 48 months (range, 21-67 months). Thirty percent had pre-RT PSA <0.1; the median pre-RT detectable PSA was 0.32 ng/mL. The median RT dose was 65 Gy (range, 57.5-65 Gy). Ten patients received neoadjuvant and concurrent hormone therapy. Posttreatment acute urinary toxicity was limited. There was no acute grade 3 toxicity. Late genitourinary (GU) toxicity of any grade was noted in 52% of patients, 40% of whom had pre-RT urinary incontinence. The 4-year actuarial rate of late grade 3 GU toxicity (exclusively gross hematuria) was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16%-41%). Most grade 3 GU toxicity resolved; only 7% had persistent grade ≥3 toxicity at the last follow-up visit. Fourteen patients experienced biochemical recurrence at a median of 20 months after radiation.

In addition, testicular (TA) and epididymal (EA) appendages are frequent paratesticular structures without previously reported comprehensive immunophenotypic studies. Immunohistochemistry for multiple markers, including the androgen receptor (AR), the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), the prostate-specific antigen, the prostate-specific membrane antigen, PAX8, WT1, calretinin, CK7, CK20, OCT4, SALL4, and CD117, was performed on full sections of testicular/paratesticular tissue from a large cohort of adult and fetal autopsy patients. In contrast to adult germ cells (GC), fetal GC strongly express OCT4 and CD117, although the expression of these proteins is lost in the early postnatal period; SALL4, in contrast, is expressed in both fetal and adult GC, with only weak and focal expression in adult patients. Fetal Sertoli cells (SC) express WT1 and calretinin strongly and diffusely, in contrast to adult SC. Both fetal and adult excretory duct systems express CK7 and PAX8 with frequent AR coexpression, and all 3 main segments of the excretory duct system (ductuli efferentes, epididymis, and vas deferens) have unique immunophenotypes. The rete testis also has a unique immunohistochemical expression pattern, which includes strong expression of CK7, PAX8, WT1, calretinin, and AR. Finally, of the adult autopsy patients examined, 80% had a TA, and 60% had an EA; these paratesticular structures occurred at stereotypical locations, demonstrated reproducible morphologic features, and had a unique immunophenotype relative to other studied structures, with strong CK7, PAX8, WT1, AR, ER, and PR coexpression. The testis and the paratestis may be involved by diverse neoplastic and non-neoplastic processes, and knowledge of the immunophenotypic expression spectrum of these tissues may aid in clinical diagnosis and advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of both oncologic and nononcologic disease processes.""","""['Martin J Magers', 'Aaron M Udager', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Diana French', 'Jeffrey L Myers', 'Jeffrey M Jentzen', 'Jonathan B McHugh', 'Amer Heider', 'Rohit Mehra']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['Epididymis-like Tubules in Adult Renal Hypodysplasia: Immunohistochemical Features Indicate a Mesonephric Origin.', ""Effects on the mouse epididymis of juvenile ligation of the ductuli efferentes or proximal epididymal duct: qualitative and quantitative histological studies (author's transl)."", 'Ectopic Leydig cells of testis An immunohistochemical study on tissue microarray.', 'Selected other problematic testicular and paratesticular lesions: rete testis neoplasms and pseudotumors, mesothelial lesions and secondary tumors.', 'The paratesticular region: histoanatomic and general considerations.', 'Expression patterns of sex steroid receptors in developing mesonephros of the male mouse: three-dimensional analysis.', 'Dysregulation of Notch-FGF signaling axis in germ cells results in cystic dilation of the rete testis in mice.', 'Estrogens and development of the rete testis, efferent ductules, epididymis and vas deferens.', 'Unraveling the Mysteries of PAX8 in Reproductive Tract Cancers.', 'CAIX and pax-8 Commonly Immunoreactive in Endolymphatic Sac Tumors: A Clinicopathologic Study of 26 Cases with Differential Considerations for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma in von Hippel-Lindau Patients.']"""

Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective study of all men with very-low-risk prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at one of 14 participating centres. Validated patient questionnaires were collected at baseline and after 12 months by independent healthcare researchers. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.25 ng/mL or treatment with salvage radiotherapy or with hormones. Urinary continence was defined as <1 pad changed per 24 h. Erectile function was defined as ability to achieve erection hard enough for penetration more than half of the time after sexual stimulation. Changes in tumour grade and stage were obtained from pathology reports. We report descriptive frequencies and proportions of men who had each outcome in various subgroups. Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences between the age groups.  Results:   Of the 4003 men in the LAPPRO cohort, 338 men fulfilled the preoperative national criteria for very-low-risk prostate cancer. Adverse pathology outcomes included upgrading, defined as pT3 or postoperative Gleason sum ≥7, which was present in 35% of the men (115/333) and positive surgical margins, which were present in 16% of the men (54/329). Only 2.1% of the men (7/329) had a PSA concentration >0.1 ng/mL 6-12 weeks postoperatively. Erectile function and urinary continence were observed in 44% (98/222) and 84% of the men (264/315), respectively, 12 months postoperatively. The proportion of men achieving the trifecta, defined as preoperative potent and continent men who remained potent and continent with no BCR, was 38% (84/221 men) at 12 months.  Conclusions:   Our prospective study of men with very-low-risk prostate cancer undergoing open or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy showed that there were favourable oncological outcomes in approximately two-thirds. Approximately 40% did not have surgically induced urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction 12 months postoperatively. These results provide additional support for the use of active surveillance in men with very-low-risk prostate cancer; however, the number of men with risk of upgrading and upstaging is not negligible.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to assess and compare the predictive accuracy of six models designed to estimate survival of patients suffering from spinal bone metastases Just (SBMs).  Summary of background data:   On the basis of the estimated survival of patients with SBM, extent of treatment can be adjusted. To aid clinicians in the difficult task of assessing probability of survival, prognostic scoring systems have been developed by Tomita, Tokuhashi, Van der Linden, Bauer, Rades, and Bollen.  Methods:   All patients who were treated for SBM between 2000 and 2010 were included in this international, multicenter, retrospective study (n = 1379). Medical records were reviewed for all items needed to use the scoring systems. Survival time was calculated as the difference between start of treatment for SBM and date of death. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and accuracy was assessed with the c-statistic. Survival rates of the worst prognostic groups were evaluated at 4 months.  Results:   Median follow-up was 6.7 years [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.6-7.7] with a minimum of 2.3 years and a maximum of 12.3 years. The overall median survival was 5.1 months (95% CI 4.6-5.6). The most common primary tumors were breast (n = 388, 28%), lung (n = 318, 23%), and prostate cancer (n = 259, 19%). The Tokuhashi, Bauer, Tomita, and Van der Linden models performed similar with a c-statistic of 0.64 to 0.66 and a 4-month accuracy of 62% to 65%. The Rades model (c-statistic 0.44) and Bollen model (c-statistic 0.70) had a 4-month accuracy of 69% and 75%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The Bollen model performs better than the other models.

Accurate assessment of their effect on survival, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and cost may elucidate the value of interventions to prevent SREs.  Materials and methods:   Men older than age 65 years with prostate cancer and bone metastasis diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 were identified from linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk for death associated with SREs were calculated by using Cox regression. HCRU and costs (in 2013 U.S. dollars) were evaluated in a propensity score-matched cohort by using Poisson regression and Kaplan-Meier sample average estimators, respectively.  Results:   Among 3,297 men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone, 40% experienced ≥1 SRE (median follow-up, 19 months). Compared with men who remained SRE-free, men with ≥1 SRE had a twofold higher risk for death (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 2.09-2.51). Pathological fracture was associated with the highest risk for death (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.38-3.23). Among men with ≥1 SRE, emergency department visits were twice as frequent (95% CI, 1.77-2.28) and hospitalizations were nearly four times as frequent (95% CI, 3.20-4.40). The attributable cost of ≥1 SRE was $21,191 (≥1 SRE: $72,454 [95% CI, $67,362-$76,958]; SRE-free: $51,263 [95% CI, $45,439-$56,100]).  Conclusion:   Among men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone, experiencing ≥1 SRE is associated with poorer survival, increased HCRU, and increased costs.

Here, we performed lipidomics and transcriptomics in paired prostate cancer tumor (PCT) and adjacent nontumor (ANT) tissues, followed by external validation of biomarker candidates. We identified major dysregulated pathways involving lipogenesis, lipid uptake and phospholipids remodeling, correlated with widespread lipid accumulation and lipid compositional reprogramming in PCa. Specifically, cholesteryl esters (CEs) were most prominently accumulated in PCa, and significantly associated with cancer progression and metastasis. We showed that overexpressed scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) may contribute to CEs accumulation. In discovery set, CEs robustly differentiated PCa from nontumor (area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), 0.90-0.94). In validation set, CEs potently distinguished PCa and non-malignance (AUC, 0.84-0.91), and discriminated PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (AUC, 0.90-0.96), superior to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (AUC = 0.83).

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is used to aid the selection of men undergoing biopsies. Its use remains controversial. We propose a GC-sensor algorithm system for classifying urine samples from patients with urological symptoms. This pilot study includes 155 men presenting to urology clinics, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria and or poor stream, without cancer. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to assess the discrimination achieved, while linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used as statistical models for sample classification. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), repeated 10-fold cross-validation (10FoldCV), repeated double cross-validation (DoubleCV) and Monte Carlo permutations were applied to assess performance. Significant separation was found between prostate cancer and control samples, bladder cancer and controls and between bladder and prostate cancer samples. For prostate cancer diagnosis, the GC/SVM system classified samples with 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity after LOOCV. For bladder cancer diagnosis, the SVM reported 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity after LOOCV, while the DoubleCV reported 87% sensitivity and 99% specificity, with SVM showing 78% and 98% sensitivity between prostate and bladder cancer samples. Evaluation of the results of the Monte Carlo permutation of class labels obtained chance-like accuracy values around 50% suggesting the observed results for bladder cancer and prostate cancer detection are not due to over fitting. The results of the pilot study presented here indicate that the GC system is able to successfully identify patterns that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers. An accurate diagnosis based on urine samples would reduce the number of negative prostate biopsies performed, and the frequency of surveillance cystoscopy for bladder cancer patients. Larger cohort studies are planned to investigate the potential of this system.

Methods:   Forty-four patients with PCa (PSA > 10 ng/ml, Gleason score 7 or more, or clinical stage cT2c or more) were included with a median follow-up of 11.4 years after RP. One group (NCT/RP) received neoadjuvant treatment 3-weekly with docetaxel (36 mg/m(2) for up to six cycles, 21 patients), the other (control) group (RP, 23 patients) received RP only.  Results:   Toxicities were mild with grade 3 events not exceeding 10%. A statistically significant reduction of PSA > 50% post-chemotherapy was observed in 52.4% cases.

In this study, we aim to investigate the role of ELK1 in tumor growth as well as the efficacy of a selective α1A-adrenergic blocker, silodosin, in ELK1 activity in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   We first immunohistochemically determined the levels of phospho-ELK1 (p-ELK1) expression in radical prostatectomy specimens. We then assessed the effects of ELK1 knockdown via short hairpin RNA and silodosin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in prostate cancer lines.  Results:   The levels of p-ELK1 expression were significantly higher in carcinoma than in benign (P < 0.001) or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) (P = 0.002) as well as in HGPIN than in benign (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed that moderate-strong positivity of p-ELK1 in carcinomas tended to correlate with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (P = 0.098). In PC3 and DU145 expressing ELK1 (mRNA/protein) but no androgen receptor (AR), ELK1 silencing resulted in considerable decreases in the expression of c-fos as well as in cell migration/invasion and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression, but not in cell viability. Silodosin treatment reduced the expression/activity of ELK1 in these cells as well as the viability of AR-positive LNCaP and C4-2 cells and the migration of both AR-positive and AR-negative cells, but not the viability of AR-negative or ELK1-negative cells. Interestingly, silodosin significantly increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, but not to cisplatin or docetaxel, even in AR-negative cells.  Conclusions:   ELK1 is likely to be activated in prostate cancer cells and promote tumor progression. Furthermore, silodosin that inactivates ELK1 in prostate cancer cells not only inhibits their growth but also enhances the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine. Thus, ELK1 inhibition has the potential of being a therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.""","""['Takashi Kawahara', 'Ali Kadhim Aljarah', 'Hasanain Khaleel Shareef', 'Satoshi Inoue', 'Hiroki Ide', 'John D Patterson', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Bin Han', 'Yi Li', 'Yichun Zheng', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Silodosin inhibits the growth of bladder cancer cells and enhances the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin via ELK1 inactivation.', 'ELK1 is up-regulated by androgen in bladder cancer cells and promotes tumor progression.', 'Silodosin inhibits noradrenaline-activated transcription factors Elk1 and SRF in human prostate smooth muscle.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Silodosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'ELK1 Enhances Pancreatic Cancer Progression Via LGMN and Correlates with Poor Prognosis.', 'MED19 alters AR occupancy and gene expression in prostate cancer cells, driving MAOA expression and growth under low androgen.', 'Effects of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists on the development and progression of urothelial cancer.', 'Impact of Vasectomy on the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer: Preclinical Evidence.', 'MiR-326: Promising Biomarker for Cancer.']"""

The 19F NMR signal of the trifluoromethyl group of both drugs showed a downfield shift from an internal standard (trifluoroethanol) and broadening according to the increase in the lipid concentration due to their interaction with LNE particles. The difference in the chemical shift (Δδ) of each drug caused by the addition of LNE was measured under different amounts of LNE, and the K p values were calculated from the Δδ values. The results showed that FT has higher lipophilicity than NT. The total lipid concentration (SO + PC) required to encapsulate each drug into LNE with an EE% of more than 95% was calculated from the K p values as 93.3 and 189.9 mmol/L for FT and NT, respectively. For an LNE prepared with the total lipid concentration of 215 mmol/L, the predicted EE% values were 98 and 96% for FT and NT, respectively, while the experimental EE% values determined by a centrifugation method were approximately 99% for both drugs.

The lymphocyte reaction in vitro on γ-irradiation at different doses (0.05-1.0 Gy) has been determined too. It was shown that in these two types of individuals the ROS content does not differ and the reaction on irradiation is not different either. Essential is the difference between the marker expression in lymphocytes of healthy donors and patients with tumour: in individuals with cancer the content of lymphocytes with CD69+ phenotype (in non active situation) and CD95+ increases, the expression of marker Ki67 decreases. The lymphocyte response to irradiation in healthy and tumour lymphocytes is distinguished. Irradiation at doses 0.05-10.0 Gy on tumour patients lymphocytes markers does not influence expression. In healthy donors' lymphocytes the expression of markers is changed considerably, the reaction depends on the marker type: expression of CD69 marker decreases (tendency); expression of Ki67 decreases too; it is unusual that the expression of CD95 changes--it decreases after irradiation at the doses of 0.05-1.0 Gy, then increases with dose. So this work shows the changes in tumour patients' blood lymphocytes in comparison with healthy donors' lymphocytes.

H2A.Z has been reported to be overexpressed in breast, prostate and bladder cancers, but most studies did not clearly distinguish between isoforms. One recent study reported a unique role for the H2A.Z isoform H2A.Z.2 as a driver of malignant melanoma. Here we first report that H2A.Z.1 plays a pivotal role in the liver tumorigenesis by selectively regulating key molecules in cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). H2AFZ expression was significantly overexpressed in a large cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and high expression of H2AFZ was significantly associated with their poor prognosis. H2A.Z.1 overexpression was demonstrated in a subset of human HCC and cell lines. H2A.Z.1 knockdown suppressed HCC cell growth by transcriptional deregulation of cell cycle proteins and caused apoptotic cell death of HCC cells. We also observed that H2A.Z.1 knockdown reduced the metastatic potential of HCC cells by selectively modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulatory proteins such as E-cadherin and fibronectin. In addition, H2A.Z.1 knockdown reduced the in vivo tumor growth rate in a mouse xenograft model. In conclusion, our findings suggest the oncogenic potential of H2A.Z.1 in liver tumorigenesis and that it plays established role in accelerating cell cycle transition and EMT during hepatocarcinogenesis. This makes H2A.Z.1 a promising target in liver cancer therapy.""","""['Hee Doo Yang', 'Pum-Joon Kim', 'Jung Woo Eun', 'Qingyu Shen', 'Hyung Seok Kim', 'Woo Chan Shin', 'Young Min Ahn', 'Won Sang Park', 'Jung Young Lee', 'Suk Woo Nam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-31 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulatory proteins in liver cancer.', 'MicroRNA-451: epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibitor and prognostic biomarker of hepatocelluar carcinoma.', 'Overexpression of the long non-coding RNA SPRY4-IT1 promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion by activating EZH2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Histone variant H2A.Z can serve as a new target for breast cancer therapy.', 'The transition from inflammation to cancer in the liver.', 'Investigation of Hippo pathway-related prognostic lncRNAs and molecular subtypes in liver hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'MicroRNA-455-3p accelerate malignant progression of tumor by targeting H2AFZ in colorectal cancer.', 'Oncogenic Role of HMGB1 as An Alarming in Robust Prediction of Immunotherapy Response in Colorectal Cancer.', 'A necroptosis -related signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Second-Generation JK-206 Targets the Oncogenic Signal Mediator RHOA in Gastric Cancer.']"""

This study aimed to examine US cancer mortality trend and disparities in sites, races, and sex. We studied cancer incidence-based mortality by race and sex from 1974 to 2008 of cervix, prostate, colon and rectum, lung, leukemia, liver, pancreas, and stomach in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We developed a model-based mortality rate and examined rate ratio of each calendar period to the first period within each race-sex group. Cancer mortality of cervix, colon and rectum, leukemia, and stomach declined in all groups. Prostate cancer increased first in all racial groups and decreased thereafter at different pace. Lung cancer declined among males of all races but increased among females. Liver cancer increased steadily fast among white and black females, doubled in whites and black males, and climbed slowly in other races. Pancreas cancer declined among black males and females, and changed little among others. Cancer mortality trend presents heterogeneity across sites, races, and sex.

We examined age-related variations of testosterone levels among black and white males, which may provide important insights into racial disparities in PCa incidence and mortality.  Method:   We analyzed data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey to compare age-related variations in the testosterone levels of 355 black and 631 white males.  Result:   Overall, between the ages of 12 and 15, black males had lower testosterone levels than white males. Testosterone levels increased rapidly with age and reached higher and earlier peak levels in black males compared to white males at 20-30 years of age. After reaching a peak level, testosterone levels declined earlier in blacks than in whites. Further analyses showed that black males had considerably higher levels of testosterone compared to white males aged 20-39 years after adjusting for covariates, including age, body mass index, cigarette smoking, physical activity, and waist circumference; however, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups at any other age.  Conclusion:   Our study revealed that testosterone levels in black males decrease substantially with increasing age compared to those in white males. This rapid drop in testosterone levels may contribute to racial disparities in PCa.

It is a suspected supporting factor for prostate diseases and their progression and a main cause of false positive PSA tests in cancer screening. We hypothesized that inflammation induces autoantibodies, which may be useful biomarkers. We aimed to identify and validate prostate inflammation associated serum autoantibodies in prostate cancer patients and evaluate the expression of corresponding autoantigens.  Methods:   Radical prostatectomy specimens of prostate cancer patients (N = 70) were classified into high and low inflammation groups according to the amount of tissue infiltrating lymphocytes. The corresponding pre-surgery blood serum samples were scrutinized for autoantibodies using a low-density protein array. Selected autoantigens were identified in prostate tissue and their expression pattern analyzed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. The identified autoantibody profile was cross-checked in an independent sample set (N = 63) using the Luminex-bead protein array technology.  Results:   Protein array screening identified 165 autoantibodies differentially abundant in the serum of high compared to low inflammation patients. The expression pattern of three corresponding antigens were established in benign and cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry and qPCR: SPAST (Spastin), STX18 (Syntaxin 18) and SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein). Of these, SPAST was significantly increased in prostate tissue with high inflammation. All three autoantigens were differentially expressed in primary and/or castration resistant prostate tumors when analyzed in an inflammation-independent tissue microarray. Cross-validation of the inflammation autoantibody profile on an independent sample set using a Luminex-bead protein array, retrieved 51 of the significantly discriminating autoantibodies. Three autoantibodies were significantly upregulated in both screens, MUT, RAB11B and CSRP2 (p>0.05), two, SPOP and ZNF671, close to statistical significance (p = 0.051 and 0.076).

All cases were immunostained using anti-CD31 antibody to delineate capillary endothelial cells. In parallel, all cases were immunostained using anti-PSMA antibody. The PSMA staining was assessed in tumor capillaries and in normal tissues and scored as a percentage of CD31 staining. PSMA expression was found in the tumor neovasculature, and no significant expression was identified in vasculature of normal tissues. The extent of PSMA staining in tumor capillaries varied from high expression in ovarian and endometrial cancers, to medium expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas, and low expression in cervical adenocarcinomas and vulvar cancers. All (100%) cases of primary ovarian carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma metastases, and primary endometrial carcinoma showed PSMA expression in tumor vasculature, which was diffuse in majority of cases. The expression of PSMA in ovarian cancer metastases was similar among different metastatic foci of the same tumor. Fifteen percent of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 50% of cervical adenocarcinoma, and 75% of vulvar carcinomas showed no capillary expression of PSMA.

However, tumors can evade host immune surveillance through multiple mechanisms, including epigenetic silencing of genes involved in antigen processing and immune recognition. Hence, there is an unmet clinical need to develop effective therapeutic strategies that can restore tumor immune recognition when combined with immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic cancer vaccines. We sought to examine the potential of clinically relevant exposure of prostate and breast human carcinoma cells to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to reverse tumor immune escape to T-cell mediated lysis. Here we demonstrate that prostate (LNCAP) and breast (MDA-MB-231) carcinoma cells are more sensitive to T-cell mediated lysis in vitro after clinically relevant exposure to epigenetic therapy with either the pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat or the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat. This pattern of immunogenic modulation was observed against a broad range of tumor-associated antigens, such as CEA, MUC1, PSA, and brachyury, and associated with augmented expression of multiple proteins involved in antigen processing and tumor immune recognition. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition studies identified HDAC1 as a key determinant in the reversal of carcinoma immune escape. Further, our findings suggest that the observed reversal of tumor immune evasion is driven by a response to cellular stress through activation of the unfolded protein response.

Previously, we found that PTEN loss by IHC was associated with increased risk of upgrading from biopsy (Gleason 3 + 3) to prostatectomy (Gleason 7+). Now, using an evaluable subset of 111 patients with adjacent biopsy sections, we analyzed the association between PTEN deletion in cancer and the odds of upgrading by a highly sensitive and specific four-color FISH assay. We also compared the concordance of PTEN loss by IHC and PTEN deletion by FISH. PTEN deletion was found in 27 % (12/45) of upgraded cases compared with 11 % (7/66) of controls (P = 0.03). Cancers with PTEN deletions were more likely to be upgraded than those without deletions (adjusting for age odds ratio = 3.40, 95 % confidence interval 1.14-10.11). With respect to concordance, of 93 biopsies with PTEN protein detected by IHC, 89 (96 %) had no PTEN deletion by FISH, and of 18 biopsies without PTEN protein by IHC, 15 had homozygous or hemizygous PTEN deletion by FISH. Only 4 biopsies of the 93 (4 %) with PTEN protein intact had PTEN deletion by FISH. When the regions of uncertainty in these biopsies were systematically studied by FISH, intra-tumoral variation of PTEN deletion was found, which could account for variation in immunoreactivity. Thus, FISH provides a different approach to determining PTEN loss when IHC is uncertain.

Methods:   All the patients were assessed for adequate preparation, and informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. The control group (n = 33) comprised patients who were negative for malignancy on biopsy. The study group (n = 22) were positive for malignancy and were also divided into three groups on the basis of the Gleason score. Study parameters included mean values for resistive index (RI), pulsatality index (PI), systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) and peak systolic velocity (PSV). These were separately measured for bilateral capsular and urethral branches and compared between groups. In patients with unilateral tumour, these were compared between the tumour and non-tumour sides. Finally, the parameters were compared with patient's age. Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the statistical significance.  Results:   The mean values of RI, PI, S/D and PSV were found to be 0.84/1.03, 1.8/1.99, 3.93/4.45 and 15.52/16.15 cm s(-1), respectively, in the control and study groups which were not statistically significant. In patients with unilateral malignancy (n = 16), there was no significant difference from the non-tumour side. Doppler parameters showed statistically significant relationships with age.

The PI and S/D also showed significant difference in the benign category.  Conclusion:   TR spectral Doppler parameters did not reveal any significant difference in patients with or without prostatic malignancy, irrespective of the Gleason grade.

Methods:   We combined an adjusted Social Security Administration table with a subset of comorbidities from a UK actuarial life expectancy model. Life tables were adjusted on the basis of survival data from a cohort of almost 10,000 radical prostatectomy patients treated at four major US academic institutions. Comorbidity-specific odds ratios were calculated and incorporated with baseline risk of mortality. We externally validated the model on 2898 patients from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, which included men diagnosed with prostate cancer in six SEER cancer registries. These men had sufficient follow-up for our endpoints of 10- and 15-year mortality and also had self-reported comorbidity data.  Results:   Life expectancy for prostate cancer patients were close to that of a typical US man who was 3 years younger. On external validation, 10- and 15-year concordance indexes were 0.724 and 0.726, respectively. Our model exhibited excellent calibration. Taking into account differences between how comorbidities are used in the model versus how they were recorded in the validation cohort, calibration would improve for most patients, but there would be overestimation of the risk of death in the oldest and sickest patients.

Materials and methods:   In the National Cancer Data Base from 2010 through 2011 patients who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (73,131) and open radical prostatectomy (23,804) for nonmetastatic prostate adenocarcinoma were identified. Covariates included age, race, Charlson comorbidity index, prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, final Gleason score, pathological T stage, lymph node dissection, nodal status, facility type, hospital volume and year of surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with positive surgical margins, use of adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy, prolonged length of stay, readmission and 30-day mortality. Outcomes were also compared in 1:1 propensity matched cohorts.  Results:   Analysis of propensity matched cohorts showed robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy reduced the risk of positive surgical margins (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, p <0.01), the use of radiation therapy (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80, p <0.01) and 30-day mortality (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13-0.60, p <0.01). The protective effect of robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for positive surgical margins was found in patients with pT2 disease only (pT2-OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91, p <0.01; pT3-OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.04, p=0.2). Similar results were obtained using multivariable regression.

It remains unclear whether methylation patterns in benign prostate tissue--prior to malignant transformation--may provide similar prognostic information. To determine whether early methylation events predict prostate cancer outcomes, we evaluated histologically benign prostate specimens from 353 men who eventually developed prostate cancer and received ""definitive"" treatment [radical prostatectomy (58%) or radiation therapy (42%)]. Cases were drawn from a large hospital-based cohort of men with benign prostate biopsy specimens collected between 1990 and 2002. Risk of disease progression associated with methylation was estimated using time-to-event analyses. Average follow-up was over 5 years; biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in 91 cases (26%). In White men, methylation of the APC gene was associated with increased risk of BCR, even after adjusting for standard clinical risk factors for prostate cancer progression (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.26; 95%CI 1.23-4.16). APC methylation was most strongly associated with a significant increased risk of BCR in White men with low prostate specific antigen at cohort entry (HR = 3.66; 95%CI 1.51-8.85). In additional stratified analyses, we found that methylation of the RARB gene significantly increased risk of BCR in African American cases who demonstrated methylation of at least one of the other four genes under study (HR = 3.80; 95%CI 1.07-13.53).

The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)/RANK pathway is critical in the progression of bone metastases. Previous studies have demonstrated that an anti-RANKL antibody (denosumab) was superior to zoledronic acid in prolonging time to first SRE in patients with bone metastases from prostate and breast cancers. However, severe hypocalcemic events occur more frequently after treatment with denosumab compared with zoledronic acid. In this study, 368 administrations of denosumab in 219 patients with metastatic bone disease from solid tumors were analyzed to clarify the risk factors for developing hypocalcemia. The results showed that grade 2/3 hypocalcemia was observed in 10.4% of the total number of denosumab administrations. Patients with higher baseline serum ALP, higher performance status (PS), or gastric cancer were at higher risk for developing hypocalcemia. The cut-off value for ALP to predict denosumab-related hypocalcemia was 587 U/L with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.81.

Total RNA was isolated from 53 biopsies, reverse transcription was performed, gene expression was determined by real time PCR (RT-PCR) then deltaCt index was determined as Ct(PCA3)--Ct(KLK3). Average deltaCt and its SD in BPH were 8.28 ± 3.13, low PIN--8.56 ± 2.64, high PIN--8.98 ±1.69, PCa--1.08 ± 2.36. We have demonstarted that deltaCt did not differ in patients with BPH, low and high grade PIN, whereas significantly increased in PCa relative to any of the three groups listed above (p < 0.0001). Expression of TMPRSS2:ERG was absent in BPH, PIN, but it was detected in 40% (4/10) of PCa cases.

This is mainly due to the absence of an available efficacious chemotherapy despite decades of research in pursuit of effective treatment approaches. A plausible target for the treatment is the established clinical relationship that the zinc levels in the malignant cells are markedly decreased compared to the normal epithelium in virtually all cases of prostate cancer, and at all stages malignancy. The decrease in zinc results from the downregulation of the functional zinc uptake transporter, ZIP1; which occurs during early development of prostate malignancy. This is an essential requirement for the development of malignancy to prevent the cytotoxic/tumor-suppressor effects of increased zinc on the premalignant and malignant cells. Thus prostate cancer is a ZIP1-deficient malignancy. This relationship provides the basis for a treatment regimen that will facilitate the uptake and accumulation of zinc into the premalignant and malignant cells. In this report we employed a zinc ionophore (clioquinol) approach in the treatment of mice with human ZIP1-deficient prostate tumors (ectopic xenograft model). Clioquinol treatment resulted in 85%inhibition of tumor growth due to the cytotoxic effects of zinc. Coupled with additional results from earlier studies, the compelling evidence provides a plausible approach for the effective treatment of human prostate cancer; including primary site malignancy, hormone-resistant cancer, and metastasis.

Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant epigenetic repression by the polycomb group (PcG) complexes fuels PCa progression, providing novel therapeutic opportunities.  Results:   In the search for potential epigenetic drivers of CRPC, we analyzed the molecular profile of PcG members in patient-derived xenografts and clinical samples. Overall, our results identify the PcG protein and methyl-lysine reader CBX2 as a potential therapeutic target in advanced PCa. We report that CBX2 was recurrently up-regulated in metastatic CRPC and that elevated CBX2 expression was correlated with poor clinical outcome in PCa cohorts. Furthermore, CBX2 depletion abrogated cell viability and induced caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in metastatic PCa cell lines. Mechanistically explaining this phenotype, microarray analysis in CBX2-depleted cells revealed that CBX2 controls the expression of many key regulators of cell proliferation and metastasis.

Cationic lipid-based nanoparticles have been widely used for this purpose, but their toxicity and undesired liver uptake after systemic injection owing to their cationic surfaces have hampered further clinical translation. This study describes the development of neutral, small lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) made of a nontoxic cationic cholesterol derivative, as a suitable carrier of systemic siRNA to treat cancers. The cationic cholesterol derivative, mono arginine-cholesterol (MA-Chol), was synthesized by directly attaching an arginine moiety to cholesterol via a cleavable ester bond. siRNA-loaded SLNPs (siRNA@SLNPs) were prepared using MA-Chol and a neutral helper lipid, dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), as major components and a small amount of PEGylated phospholipid mixed with siRNA. The resulting nanoparticles were less than ~50 nm in diameter with neutral zeta potential and much lower toxicity than typical cationic cholesterol (DC-Chol)-based lipid nanoparticles. SLNPs loaded with siRNA against kinesin spindle protein (siKSP@SLNPs) exhibited a high level of target gene knockdown in various cancer cell lines, as shown by measurement of KSP mRNA and cell death assays. Furthermore, systemic injection of siKSP@SLNPs into prostate tumor-bearing mice resulted in preferential accumulation of the delivered siRNA at the tumor site and significant inhibition of tumor growth, with little apparent toxicity, as shown by body weight measurements.

Failure of life-prolonging AR-targeting androgen deprivation therapy is due to flexibility in steroidogenic pathways that control intracrine androgen levels and variability in the AR transcriptional output. Androgen biosynthesis enzymes, androgen transporters and AR-associated coregulators are attractive novel CaP treatment targets. These proteins, however, are characterized by multiple transcript variants and isoforms, are subject to genomic alterations, and are differentially expressed among CaPs. Determining their therapeutic potential requires evaluation of extensive, diverse datasets that are dispersed over multiple databases, websites and literature reports. Mining and integrating these datasets are cumbersome, time-consuming tasks and provide only snapshots of relevant information. To overcome this impediment to effective, efficient study of AR and potential drug targets, we developed the Regulators of Androgen Action Resource (RAAR), a non-redundant, curated and user-friendly searchable web interface. RAAR centralizes information on gene function, clinical relevance, and resources for 55 genes that encode proteins involved in biosynthesis, metabolism and transport of androgens and for 274 AR-associated coregulator genes. Data in RAAR are organized in two levels: (i) Information pertaining to production of androgens is contained in a 'pre-receptor level' database, and coregulator gene information is provided in a 'post-receptor level' database, and (ii) an 'other resources' database contains links to additional databases that are complementary to and useful to pursue further the information provided in RAAR. For each of its 329 entries, RAAR provides access to more than 20 well-curated publicly available databases, and thus, access to thousands of data points. Hyperlinks provide direct access to gene-specific entries in the respective database(s).

This response can also be triggered by pharmaceuticals. Predicting clinical nausea and vomiting liability for pharmaceutical agents based on pre-clinical data can be problematic as no single animal model is a universal predictor. Moreover, efforts to improve models are hampered by the lack of translational animal and human data in the public domain. AZD3514 is a novel, orally-administered compound that inhibits androgen receptor signaling and down-regulates androgen receptor expression. Here we have explored the utility of integrating data from several pre-clinical models to predict nausea and vomiting in the clinic. Single and repeat doses of AZD3514 resulted in emesis, salivation and gastrointestinal disturbances in the dog, and inhibited gastric emptying in rats after a single dose. AZD3514, at clinically relevant exposures, induced dose-responsive ""pica"" behaviour in rats after single and multiple daily doses, and induced retching and vomiting behaviour in ferrets after a single dose. We compare these data with the clinical manifestation of nausea and vomiting encountered in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving AZD3514. Our data reveal a striking relationship between the pre-clinical observations described and the experience of nausea and vomiting in the clinic. In conclusion, the emetic nature of AZD3514 was predicted across a range of pre-clinical models, and the approach presented provides a valuable framework for predicition of clinical nausea and vomiting.""","""['Claire Grant', 'Lorna Ewart', 'Daniel Muthas', 'Damian Deavall', 'Simon A Smith', 'Glen Clack', 'Pete Newham']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['AZD3514, an oral selective androgen receptor down-regulator in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer - results of two parallel first-in-human phase I studies.', 'A new orally active, aminothiol radioprotector-free of nausea and hypotension side effects at its highest radioprotective doses.', 'Signals for nausea and emesis: Implications for models of upper gastrointestinal diseases.', 'Effects of ganoderma lucidum extract on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in a rat model.', 'Prognostic factors for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.']"""

AR cistrome analyses in CRPC cells have identified a large number of AR target genes involved in proliferative and cell cycle-related functions, and hold promise for development of novel therapeutic approaches for CRPC. However, there is little understanding of how these genes function in vivo and what the clinical implications are. We previously reported that secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) is regulated by the AR in a ligand-independent manner in CRPC cells and required for CRPC cell proliferation under androgen-deprived conditions. SLPI is a secreted serine protease inhibitor, which is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including lung, breast and ovarian cancer, and involved in tumor progression. However, the oncogenic potential of SLPI in prostate cancer remains unknown. Here we provide the first evidence that SLPI is upregulated in a subset of CRPC cell lines and CRPC patient tumors. In addition, serum SLPI levels are significantly elevated in metastatic CRPC patients compared with hormone naive patients, raising the possibility that this could serve as a biomarker. We demonstrated that SLPI expression has functional significance, as it promotes CRPC cell survival and growth after androgen withdrawal in vivo and in vitro. Last, we demonstrated that the oncogenic effect of SLPI may be due to protection of growth factor progranulin from enzymatic cleavage or suppression of CRPC cell apoptosis independent of anti-protease activity of SLPI. These findings implicate SLPI as a potential biomarker of resistance to AR inhibition and therapeutic target for CRPC treatment.""","""['D Zheng', 'B Gui', 'K P Gray', 'I Tinay', 'S Rafiei', 'Q Huang', 'C J Sweeney', 'A S Kibel', 'L Jia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in human samples might have a potential role of predicting prostate cancer recurrence and progression after surgery and hormonal therapy.', 'CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.', 'SLPI suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression via endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis.', 'Selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer growth through disruption of FOXA1 function.', 'Plasma concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) differ depending on etiology and severity in community-onset bloodstream infection.']"""

In vitro studies showed that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value (20.2 μM) of M-QCTs was much lower than free QCT (>200 μM). Thus, M-QCTs were considerably more effective than free QCT in proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of human androgen-independent PC-3 cells. Furthermore, M-QCTs showed superior antitumor efficacy and the tumor proliferation rate reduced by 52.03% compared to the control group in the PC-3 xenograft mouse model, possibly due to increased accumulation of M-QCTs at the tumor site by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Collectively, our studies demonstrated that M-QCTs significantly increase drug accumulation at the tumor site and exhibit superior anticancer activity in prostate cancer. Thus, our nanomicelle-based drug delivery system constitutes a promising and effective therapeutic strategy for clinical treatment.""","""['Jing Zhao', 'Juan Liu', 'Tuo Wei', 'Xiaowei Ma', 'Qiang Cheng', 'Shuaidong Huo', 'Chunqiu Zhang', 'Yanan Zhang', 'Xianglin Duan', 'Xing-Jie Liang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Enhancing the anti-colon cancer activity of quercetin by self-assembled micelles.', 'Codelivery of GRP78 siRNA and docetaxel via RGD-PEG-DSPE/DOPA/CaP nanoparticles for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PEG-OCL micelles for quercetin solubilization and inhibition of cancer cell growth.', 'Quercetin Loaded Nanoparticles in Targeting Cancer: Recent Development.', 'Bioavailability of quercetin: problems and promises.', 'Intrinsically fluorescent and quercetin loaded highly crosslinked polyphosphazene nanospheres: synthesis, characterization and fluorescence properties.', 'Recent Advances in Potential Health Benefits of Quercetin.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Targeted delivery of quercetin by biotinylated mixed micelles for non-small cell lung cancer treatment.']"""

Androgen-independent prostate cancer has severe chemoresistance towards conventional chemotherapeutic agents, so a new treatment approach is required for curing such prostate cancer. In this context, the present study was undertaken to check if annatto tocotrienol (main component δ-tocotrienol) could suppress cell growth in human prostate cancer (PC3, androgen-independent type) cells via the inhibition of Src and Stat3. The tocotrienol showed cytotoxic effects on PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the effect depended on G1 arrest in the cell cycle and subsequent induction of apoptosis. In a cytotoxic dose, the tocotrienol suppressed cellular growth via the simultaneous inhibition of Src and Stat3. Similarly, the treatment combination of both Src and Stat3 inhibitors induced cytotoxic effects in PC3 cells in an additive manner compared to each by itself. With respect to cell cycle regulation and the induction of apoptosis, the combination treatment showed a similar effect to that of the tocotrienol treatment. These results suggest that annatto tocotrienol effectively induces cytotoxicity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via the suppression of Src and Stat3.""","""['Ryosuke Sugahara', 'Ayami Sato', 'Asuka Uchida', 'Shinya Shiozawa', 'Chiaki Sato', 'Nantiga Virgona', 'Tomohiro Yano']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)""","""['A redox-silent analogue of tocotrienol acts as a potential cytotoxic agent against human mesothelioma cells.', 'Combination Effect of δ-Tocotrienol and γ-Tocopherol on Prostate Cancer Cell Growth.', 'Cytotoxicity and apoptotic activities of alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienol isomers on human cancer cells.', 'Tocotrienols target PI3K/Akt signaling in anti-breast cancer therapy.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of the Anticancer Effects of Annatto Tocotrienol, Delta-Tocotrienol and Gamma-Tocotrienol on Chondrosarcoma Cells.', 'Vitamin E and cancer prevention: Studies with different forms of tocopherols and tocotrienols.', 'δ-Tocotrienol induces apoptosis, involving endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy, and paraptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Vitamin E as an Antioxidant in Female Reproductive Health.']"""

We investigated M. hominis proteins targeting the nucleus of host cells and their implications in prostate cancer etiology. Many vital processes are controlled in the nucleus, where the proteins targeting M. hominis may have various potential implications. A total of 29/563 M. hominis proteins were predicted to target the nucleus of host cells. These include numerous proteins with the capability to alter normal growth activities.

We examined biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), clinical recurrence-free survival (CRFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in a multi-institutional cohort of men undergoing RARP for localized PCa.  Materials and methods:   A total of 5670 PCa patients undergoing RARP ± pelvic lymph node dissection as primary treatment modality at three tertiary care centers between 2001 and 2010 were analyzed. BCRFS, CRFS, and CSS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model tested their association with available preoperative and postoperative parameters.  Results:   43.6 and 15.1 % of patients had D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk disease, respectively. Over a mean (median) follow-up of 56 (50.4) months, 797 men had a BCR, 78 men had CR, and 32 men died of PCa. Actuarial BCRFS, CRFS, and CSS, respectively, were 83.3, 98.6, and 99.5 % at 5-year; 76.5, 97.5, and 98.7 % at 8-year; and 73.3, 96.7, and 98.4 % at 10-year follow-ups. Only 1.7 % of patients received any adjuvant treatment. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and biopsy Gleason score (GS) were independent clinical predictors of BCRFS, CRFS, and CSS, while postoperatively positive surgical margin, pathological GS, pathological stage, and lymph node invasion were significantly associated with BCR and CR (all p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Cancer control outcomes of RARP appear comparable to those reported for open and laparoscopic RP in previous literature, despite low overall rate of adjuvant treatment.

Here we report the development of a new tumor model using PCL/HAPClay scaffolds seeded with a sequential culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) followed by human prostate cancer cells (HPCCs). This nanocomposite system is used as a test-bed for studying cancer metastasis and efficacy of anti-cancer drugs using a polymersome delivery method. A novel sequential cell culture system in three-dimensional in vitro bone model provides a unique bone mimetic environment. The hMSCs seeded scaffolds are seeded with prostate cancer cells after the hMSCs have differentiated into osteoblasts. Sequential culture on the scaffolds has shown formation of tumoroids or microtissue consisting of organized, densely packed round cells with hypoxic core regions similar to in vivo tumors. Such tumoroids are not observed on HPCC seeded scaffolds or when HPCCs sequentially cultured with human osteoblast cells. Clearly, the newly differentiated hMSCs play a vital role in the ability of cancer cells to grow into tumoroids and cause disease.

The role of tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins remains unclear in PC. We investigated TRIM protein 47 (TRIM47) expression levels in human prostate tissues.  Methods:   We performed immunohistochemistry using original TRIM47 antibody in prostate tissues obtained by radical prostatectomy (n = 105). Stained slides were evaluated for the proportion and staining intensity of immunoreactive cells. Total immunoreactivity (IR) scores (range, 0-8) were calculated as the sum of the proportion and intensity scores. TRIM47 expression levels were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Associations between the clinicopathologic features of the patients and their TRIM47 status were analyzed.  Results:   Western blot analysis validated the specificity of the anti-TRIM47 antibody in 293T cells. TRIM47 expression levels were found to be significantly increased in PC compared to benign tissues by both immunohistochemistry (P < .0001) and qRT-PCR (P = .003). Additionally, advanced pathologic stage (≥ T3b) was found to be associated with high TRIM47 IR scores (≥ 4; P = .04). Furthermore, high TRIM47 IR scores were also significantly correlated with worse cancer-specific survival rates in multivariate regression analyses (hazard ratio, 6.82; P = .016).

The correction often involves body leaning, and there is concern regarding variation in the dose distribution. Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the impact of body pitch rotation on the dose distribution regarding VMAT. Treatment plans were obtained retrospectively from eight patients with prostate cancer. The body in the computed tomography images for the original VMAT plan was shifted to create VMAT plans with virtual pitch angle errors of ±1.5° and ±3°. Dose distributions for the tilted plans were recalculated with use of the same beam arrangement as that used for the original VMAT plan. The mean value of the maximum dose differences in the dose distributions between the original VMAT plan and the tilted plans was 2.98 ± 0.96 %. The value of the homogeneity index for the planning target volume (PTV) had an increasing trend according to the pitch angle error, and the values of the D 95 for the PTV and D 2ml, V 50, V 60, and V 70 for the rectum had decreasing trends (p < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between differences in these indexes and the maximum dose difference. The pitch angle error caused by body leaning had little effect on the dose distribution; in contrast, the pitch angle correction reduced the effects of organ displacement and improved these indexes. Thus, the pitch angle setup error in VMAT for prostate cancer should be corrected.""","""['Akihiro Takemura', 'Kumiko Togawa', 'Tomohiro Yokoi', 'Shinichi Ueda', 'Kimiya Noto', 'Hironori Kojima', 'Naoki Isomura', 'Tomoyasu Kumano']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiol Phys Technol""","""['Variations in dosimetric distribution and plan complexity with collimator angles in hypofractionated volumetric arc radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer.', 'Is Halcyon feasible for single thoracic or lumbar vertebral segment SBRT?', 'Dynamic collimator angle adjustments during volumetric modulated arc therapy to account for prostate rotations.', 'Evaluation of the sensitivity of two 3D diode array dosimetry systems to setup error for quality assurance (QA) of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT).', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Comparison of prostate verification with implanted gold markers in tissue surrounding the prostate and pelvic bony anatomy for external beam radiation therapy following low-dose-rate brachytherapy: a prospective clinical trial.']"""

Intolerance of uncertainty, that is the tendency to perceive the potential for negative events as threatening, has been linked to cancer related worry. Accordingly we explored prospectively the relationship of intolerance of uncertainty with anxiety along with other clinical factors among men treated with active surveillance for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 119 men with D'Amico low risk prostate cancer participating in active surveillance completed the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), MAX-PC (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), IUS (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale) and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) surveys from 2011 to 2014. We evaluated the relationship between anxiety and IUS score after adjusting for patient characteristics, cancer information and I-PSS using bivariable and multivariable analyses.  Results:   Of the men 18 (15.1%) and 17 (14.3%) reported clinically significant anxiety on the generalized and prostate cancer specific scales, respectively. On bivariable analysis men with moderate/severe urinary symptoms and higher IUS scores reported more generalized and prostate cancer specific anxiety than men with mild urinary symptoms and lower IUS scores, respectively (p ≤0.008). Men with depressive symptoms (p = 0.024) or a family history of prostate cancer (p = 0.006) experienced greater generalized anxiety. On multivariable analysis IUS score was significantly associated with generalized and prostate cancer specific anxiety (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.38 and OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13-1.49, respectively) while moderate/severe urinary symptoms were associated with prostate cancer specific anxiety (OR 6.89, 95% CI 1.33-35.68).  Conclusions:   Intolerance of uncertainty and urinary symptoms may promote anxiety in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. Patient education, management of lower urinary tract symptoms and behavioral interventions may lessen anxiety related to uncertainty intolerance and help maintain patient engagement in active surveillance.""","""['Hung-Jui Tan', 'Leonard S Marks', 'Michael A Hoyt', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Christopher P Filson', 'Malu Macairan', 'Patricia Lieu', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Annette L Stanton']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Long-Term Cancer Specific Anxiety in Men Undergoing Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Findings from a Large Prospective Cohort.', 'A longitudinal study on the impact of active surveillance for prostate cancer on anxiety and distress levels.', 'Relationship between illness uncertainty, anxiety, fear of progression and quality of life in men with favourable-risk prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance.', 'Psychosocial aspects of active surveillance.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Intolerance of uncertainty, experiential avoidance, and trust in physician: a moderated mediation analysis of emotional distress in advanced cancer.', 'The role of uncertainty intolerance in adjusting to long-term physical health conditions: A systematic review.', 'The predictive role of intolerance of uncertainty and trait of worry in breast cancer patients: A prospective, observational, single-center clinical study.', 'Prostate cancer-related anxiety among long-term survivors after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal study.', 'Impact of active surveillance for prostate cancer on the risk of depression and anxiety.']"""

Mining of public database suggests that FGF13 (FHF2) mRNA expression is altered in over 30% of PCa cases. This study examined the FGF13 expression pattern in human PCa specimens and evaluated its potential as a biomarker for patient outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that FGF13 was detectable in the majority of human PCa samples, and FGF13 IHC scores were higher in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, in primary PCa and in metastatic PCa than in benign prostatic tissue. There was a significant association between high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining and a risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. This was also evident in the intermediate to high-risk patient groups. In contrast, positive nuclear FGF13 staining along with low cytoplasmic FGF13 group showed a decreased BCR risk. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining was associated with BCR and that this could serve as an independent prognostic marker in PCa. Several PCa cell lines showed increased FGF13 expression at the mRNA and protein levels compared to the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line PNT1a. Analysis of co-labeled cells suggested a possible interaction of FGF13 with α-tubulin and the voltage-gated sodium channel proteins (Na(V)s/VGSCs).

Self-assembly of molecular probes into supramolecular nanoprobes presents a potential strategy to alter their interaction mechanisms with cells to promote or reduce their cellular uptake. Here, we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of peptide-based molecular beacons into supramolecular protease sensors of either spherical or filamentous shapes. We found that positively charged spherical nanobeacons demonstrate much higher cellular uptake efficiency than its monomeric form, thus making them most suitable for intracellular sensing of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Our results also suggest that assembly into filamentous nanobeacons significantly reduces their internalization by cancer cells, an important property that can be utilized for probing extracellular protease activities.

Group A included 200 patients who underwent RALP between February 2008 and May 2011, with hemostasis performed using only traditional techniques. Group B included the remaining 192 patients, who underwent RALP between June 2011 and July 2014 and received FloSeal 5 ml after traditional hemostatic methods. We compared the blood transfusion rate, the differences between immediate postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) and mean postoperative day 1 (POD1) Hb levels, difference between POD1 and least Hb levels and difference between immediate postoperative Hb and least Hb levels.  Results:   The intraoperative use of FloSeal significantly decreased the blood transfusions rate, from 8.5 to 2.1% (p = 0.004).

It does not express androgen receptor (AR) or respond to hormonal therapies. Clinically applicable markers for its early detection and treatment with effective chemotherapy are needed. Our studies in patient tumor-derived xenografts (PDX) revealed that AR-negative SCPC (AR(-)SCPC) expresses neural development genes instead of the prostate luminal epithelial genes characteristic of AR-positive castration-resistant adenocarcinomas (AR(+)ADENO). We hypothesized that the differences in cellular lineage programs are reflected in distinct epigenetic profiles. To address this hypothesis, we compared the DNA methylation profiles of AR(-) and AR(+) PDX using methylated CpG island amplification and microarray (MCAM) analysis and identified a set of differentially methylated promoters, validated in PDX and corresponding donor patient samples. We used the Illumina 450K platform to examine additional regions of the genome and the correlation between the DNA methylation profiles of the PDX and their corresponding patient tumors. Struck by the low frequency of AR promoter methylation in the AR(-)SCPC, we investigated this region's specific histone modification patterns by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We found that the AR promoter was enriched in silencing histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K9me2) and that EZH2 inhibition with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) resulted in AR expression and growth inhibition in AR(-)SCPC cell lines.

Patients:   Five-thousand seven hundred and sixteen patients with prostate cancer and a recorded diagnostic PSA level extracted from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC) database. Men included were diagnosed between January 1998 and August 2013.  Methods:   Patients were divided into groups according to diagnostic PSA level: <20, 20-≤100, 100-≤200 ng/mL, 200-≤500 ng/mL, and >500 ng/mL. Outcomes measured include overall survival and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Clinical stage, Gleason score and the presence of bony metastasis was evaluated to determine if they were prognostic factors in patients with PSA over 100 at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks regression were used to model overall survival and prostate cancer-specific mortality outcomes respectively.  Results:   Of this cohort, 241 patients (4.2%) had a diagnostic PSA level >100 ng/mL. Patients with PSA >100 ng/mL have a significant reduction in five (29.1% vs 62.5% vs 87%) and ten-year (18.2% vs 36.7% vs 70.7%) overall survival when compared to men with diagnostic PSA 20-100 and <20 ng/mL respectively. In this group, prostate cancer-specific mortality was associated with Gleason score and metastases, but not PSA level at diagnosis. Overall survival was associated with PSA level, Gleason score and age. There was a linear increase in risk (overall survival) as PSA increased until 200 and no association thereafter. Models of overall survival and prostate cancer-specific mortality incorporating a risk stratification developed by Izumi et al. predicted overall survival but not prostate cancer-specific mortality. The use of this stratification did not improve model accuracy.  Conclusion:   Only a small number of men (4.2%) with prostate cancer present with PSA >100 ng/mL at diagnosis. Overall survival at five and ten years was significantly poorer in patients with PSA >100 ng/mL.

We identified 3,567 DMRs between normal and cancer tissues, and 913 DMRs distinguishing low from high-grade cancers. Most of these DMRs were located at CGI shores. The top 5 candidate DMRs from the low vs. high Gleason comparison, including OPCML, ELAVL2, EXT1, IRX5, and FLRT2, were validated by pyrosequencing using the discovery cohort. OPCML and FLRT2 were further validated in an independent cohort consisting of 20 low-Gleason and 33 high-Gleason tissues.

Methods:   Cdc20 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 166 cases, including 60 cases of benign hyperplasia of prostate (BPH) patients treated by transurethral resection and 106 cases of consecutive PCa patients treated by LRP without neoadjuvant therapy in a single Chinese institution. The correlation with clinicopathological features and the predictive value for BCR were statistically analyzed.  Results:   Cdc20 expression was detected in 52 (86.7%) BPH and 97 (91.5%) PCa samples, which was statistically insignificant (P= 0.675). The rate of patients with high expression of Cdc20 was 21.7% in BPH and 37.7% in PCa (P= 0.033). A correlation was revealed between Cdc20 expression and postoperative Gleason scores (P= 0.046), positive surgical margin (P< 0.001). BCR-free survival was significantly lower in patients with high Cdc20 expression than those with low Cdc20 expression (P= 0.018). Univariate analysis indicated pTstage, post operative Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node invasion, surgical margin and Cdc20 expression significantly influenced BCR. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node invasion, surgical margin and Cdc20 expression were independent predictors for BCR. After stratified by Gleason score and surgical margin status, Cdc20 expression and lymph node invasion remained significant in Cox regression analysis.  Conclusions:   Overexpression of Cdc20 may serve as an independent predictor for BCR in patients of clinically localized PCa undergoing LRP without neoadjuvant therapy.""","""['Yunhua Mao', 'Ke Li', 'Li Lu', 'Jie Si-Tu', 'Minhua Lu', 'Xin Gao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['Implications of greater short-term PSA recurrence with laparoscopic as compared to retropubic radical prostatectomy for Japanese clinically localized prostate carcinomas.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of CDC20 expression in malignancy patients: A meta-analysis.', 'Identification of biomarkers and key pathways in synovial sarcoma cells exposed to anlotinib by integrating bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation.', 'The Prognostic Assessment of CDC20 in Patients with Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma and Its Relationship with Body Immunity.', 'Identification of Pathologic and Prognostic Genes in Prostate Cancer Based on Database Mining.']"""

Methods:   This multi-cohort study examined the association between working hours and cancer risk in 116 462 men and women who were free of cancer at baseline. Incident cancers were ascertained from national cancer, hospitalisation and death registers; weekly working hours were self-reported.  Results:   During median follow-up of 10.8 years, 4371 participants developed cancer (n colorectal cancer: 393; n lung cancer: 247; n breast cancer: 833; and n prostate cancer: 534). We found no clear evidence for an association between working hours and the overall cancer risk. Working hours were also unrelated the risk of incident colorectal, lung or prostate cancers. Working ⩾55 h per week was associated with 1.60-fold (95% confidence interval 1.12-2.29) increase in female breast cancer risk independently of age, socioeconomic position, shift- and night-time work and lifestyle factors, but this observation may have been influenced by residual confounding from parity.

We rationally designed P1' α-ketobenzothiazole mechanism-based inhibitors of these proteases. Structure-activity studies are presented, which resulted in the identification of potent inhibitors with differential selectivity. The tetrapeptide inhibitors span the P1-P1' substrate cleavage site via a P1' amide linker off the benzothiazole, occupying the S3' pocket. Optimized inhibitors display sub-nanomolar enzyme inhibition against one, two, or all three of HGFA, matriptase, and hepsin. Several compounds also have good selectivity against the related trypsin-like proteases, thrombin and Factor Xa. Finally, we show that inhibitors block the fibroblast (HGF)-mediated migration of invasive DU145 prostate cancer cells. In addition to prostate cancer, breast, colon, lung, pancreas, gliomas, and multiple myeloma tumors all depend on HGF and MSP for tumor survival and progression.

Participants:   Prospective, observational study at a non-academic, average-size hospital in Switzerland. Inclusion and progression criteria meet general recommendations. 157 patients at a median age of 67 (61-70) years were included from December 1999 to March 2012. Follow-up (FU) ended June 2013.  Results:   Median FU was 48 (30-84) months.

The objectives were to tabulate the rate and ascertain factors associated with eventual publication of clinical trial results reported as abstracts in the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (American Society of Clinical Oncology).  Materials and methods:   Abstracts describing clinical trials for patients with breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer from 2009 to 2011 were identified by using a comprehensive online database (http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/abstracts). Abstracts included reported results of a treatment or intervention assessed in a discrete, prospective clinical trial. Publication status at 4-6 years was determined by using a standardized search of PubMed. Primary outcomes were the rate of publication for abstracts of randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials. Secondary outcomes included factors influencing the publication of results.  Results:   A total of 1,075 abstracts describing 378 randomized and 697 nonrandomized clinical trials were evaluated. Across all years, 75% of randomized and 54% of nonrandomized trials were published, with an overall publication rate of 61%. Sample size was a statistically significant predictor of publication for both randomized and nonrandomized trials (odds ratio [OR] per increase of 100 participants = 1.23 [1.11-1.36], p < .001; and 1.64 [1.15-2.34], p = .006, respectively). Among randomized studies, an industry coauthor or involvement of a cooperative group increased the likelihood of publication (OR 2.37, p = .013; and 2.21, p = .01, respectively). Among nonrandomized studies, phase II trials were more likely to be published than phase I (p < .001). Use of an experimental agent was not a predictor of publication in randomized (OR 0.76 [0.38-1.52]; p = .441) or nonrandomized trials (OR 0.89 [0.61-1.29]; p = .532).  Conclusion:   This is the largest reported study examining why oncology trials are not published. The data show that 4-6 years after appearing as abstracts, 39% of oncology clinical trials remain unpublished. Larger sample size and advanced trial phase were associated with eventual publication; among randomized trials, an industry-affiliated author or a cooperative group increased likelihood of publication. Unfortunately, we found that, despite widespread recognition of the problem and the creation of central data repositories, timely publishing of oncology clinical trials results remains unsatisfactory.""","""['Paul R Massey', 'Ruibin Wang', 'Vinay Prasad', 'Susan E Bates', 'Tito Fojo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Publication outcomes of phase II oncology clinical trials.', 'Factors associated with failure to publish large randomized trials presented at an oncology meeting.', 'Presentation and subsequent publication rates of phase I oncology clinical trials.', 'A decade of breast cancer clinical investigation: results as reported in the Program/Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.', 'Comparison of published and unpublished phase I clinical cancer trials: an analysis of the CliniclTrials.gov database.', 'Completion and publication of clinical trials in a cooperative group: a cohort study of trials of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).', 'CIViCdb 2022: evolution of an open-access cancer variant interpretation knowledgebase.', 'Availability of Results of Trials Studying Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma over the Past 10 Years.', 'Domain-topic models with chained dimensions: Charting an emergent domain of a major oncology conference.', 'Clinical Trial Design and Drug Approval in Oncology: A Primer for the Advanced Practitioner in Oncology.']"""

Since 5-LO, mPGES1, PPARα, and PPARγ represent potential anti-cancer drug targets, we here investigated the effects of 39 pirinixic acid derivatives on prostate cancer (PC-3) and neuroblastoma (UKF-NB-3) cell viability and, subsequently, the effects of selected compounds on drug-resistant neuroblastoma cells. Few compounds affected cancer cell viability in low micromolar concentrations but there was no correlation between the anti-cancer effects and the effects on 5-LO, mPGES1, PPARα, or PPARγ. Most strikingly, pirinixic acid derivatives interfered with drug transport by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 in a drug-specific fashion.

Beyond Gleason Score, Prostate Serum Antigen and tumor stage, nowadays there are no biological prognostic factors to discriminate between indolent and aggressive tumors.The most common known genomic alterations are the TMPRSS-ETS translocation and mutations in the PI3K, MAPK pathways and in p53, RB and c-MYC genes.The aim of this retrospective study was to identify by next generation sequencing the most frequent genetic variations (GVs) in localized and locally advanced PCa underwent prostatectomy and to investigate their correlation with clinical-pathological variables and disease progression.  Results:   Identified non-synonymous GVs included TP53 p.P72R (78% of tumors), two CSFR1 SNPs, rs2066934 and rs2066933 (70%), KDR p.Q472H (67%), KIT p.M541L (28%), PIK3CA p.I391M (19%), MET p.V378I (10%) and FGFR3 p.F384L/p.F386L (8%). TP53 p.P72R, MET p.V378I and CSFR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the HI risk group, TP53 and MET variations with T≥T2c. FGFR3 p.F384L/p.F386L was correlated with T≤T2b. MET p.V378I mutation, detected in 20% of HI risk patients, was associated with early biochemical recurrence.  Experimental design:   Nucleic acids were obtained from tissue samples of 30 high (HI) and 30 low-intermediate (LM) risk patients, according to D'Amico criteria. Genomic DNA was explored with the Ion_AmpliSeq_Cancer_Hotspot_Panel_v.2 including 50 cancer-associated genes.

The current triptorelin 22.5 mg 6-month formulation is approved for prostate cancer therapy. This is the first study in patients with CPP.  Methods:   The efficacy and safety of the triptorelin 6-month formulation in CPP were investigated. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy in achieving luteinizing hormone (LH) suppression to pre-pubertal levels at month 6. This was an international, non-comparative phase III study over 48 weeks. Eighteen medical centers in the US, Chile and Mexico participated. Forty-four treatment naïve patients (39 girls and five boys) aged at treatment start 2-8 years for girls and 2-9 years for boys with an advancement of bone age over chronological age ≥1 year were to be included. Triptorelin was administered im twice at an interval of 24 weeks. LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (basal and stimulated), estradiol (girls), testosterone (boys), auxological parameters, clinical signs of puberty and safety were assessed.  Results:   Forty-one patients (93.2%) showed pre-pubertal LH levels (stimulated LH ≤5 IU/L) at month 6 and maintained LH suppression through month 12. The percentage of patients with LH suppression exceeded 93% at each time point and reached 97.7% at month 12. No unexpected drug-related adverse events were reported.

Despite extensive evidence-based guidelines for screening, it is unclear how cancer screening has changed in the Medicare population over time. We characterize trends in cancer screening for the most common cancer types in the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program in the context of conflicting guidelines from 2000 to 2012.  Materials and methods:   We performed a descriptive analysis of retrospective claims data from the Medicare FFS program based on billing codes. Our data include all claims for Medicare part B beneficiaries who received breast, colorectal (CRC), or prostate cancer screening from 2000 to 2012 based on billing codes. We utilize a Monte Carlo permutation method to detect changes in screening trends.  Results:   In total, 231,416,732 screening tests were analyzed from 2000 to 2012, representing an average of 436.8 tests per 1000 beneficiaries per year. Mammography rates declined 7.4%, with digital mammography extensively replacing film. CRC cancer screening rates declined overall. As a percentage of all CRC screening tests, colonoscopy grew from 32% to 71%. Prostate screening rates increased 16% from 2000 to 2007, and then declined to 7% less than its 2000 rate by 2012.  Discussion:   Both the aggressiveness of screening guidelines and screening rates for the Medicare FFS population peaked and then declined from 2000 to 2012. However, guideline publications did not consistently precede utilization trend shifts. Technology adoption, practical and financial concerns, and patient preferences may have also contributed to the observed trends.

The aim of this study was to assess whether some prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-related variables of tumor cell kinetics predict the overall survival in early and late mCRPC, and to explore changes in the tumor growth fraction after chemotherapy.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 3 tumor cell kinetic variables in patients with mCRPC receiving first-line chemotherapy has been performed. The PSA-related tumor growth rate, the log ratio, and the tumor response have been measured at 3 different times. A further analysis has been performed after stratification by the Gleason score and chemotherapy. Finally, tumor growth after progression to chemotherapy has been explored.  Results:   G at castration resistance is significantly associated with survival after chemotherapy among patients with a low Gleason score (r=-0.650, P-value=0.022). At the time of first-line chemotherapy, both G and PSA response rates report a significant relationship with survival. At the time of postchemotherapy progression, only the G after 12 weeks of chemotherapy maintains a relationship with survival in patients with a low Gleason score (r=-0.483, P-value=0.023); in particular, a tumor growth rate <-0.5%/day appears to be associated with a poor postprogression survival. Despite the lack of correlation between postprogression G and postprogression survival, the response to chemotherapy defines 2 groups with different growth characteristics.

Light-dose planning software provided dose plans, including light source positions and light doses, based on ultrasound images. A laser instrument provided therapeutic light and dosimetric measurements. The procedure was designed to closely emulate the procedure for whole-prostate PDT in humans with prostate cancer. Nine healthy dogs were subjected to the procedure according to a light-dose escalation plan. About 0.15 mg/kg temoporfin was administered 72 h before the procedure. The results of the procedure were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and gross pathology and histopathology of excised tissue.

Nevertheless, quantification of biological specimens via any optical measures most often reveals ambiguous information about the specific structural properties within the studied samples. Thus, optical quantification remains nonintuitive to users from the diverse fields of technique application. In this work, we demonstrate that the SM signal can be analyzed to reconstruct explicit physical measures of internal structure within label-free, weakly scattering samples: characteristic length scale and the amplitude of spatial refractive-index (RI) fluctuations. We present and validate the reconstruction algorithm via finite-difference time-domain solutions of Maxwell's equations on an example of exponential spatial correlation of RI. We apply the validated algorithm to experimentally measure structural properties within isolated cells from two genetic variants of HT29 colon cancer cell line as well as within a prostate tissue biopsy section.

All patients underwent uroflowmetry before PBx; those with a peak flow rate (PFR) <10 mL/s were considered to have BOO.The incidence of PCa was 41.3% (1104/2673) in the overall population and 34.1% (659/1905) in patients with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/mL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that patients with BOO had a significantly (P < 0.0001) lower risk than those without BOO of being diagnosed with PCa (33.1% vs 66.9% in the overall population; 30% vs 70% in patients with PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL). As the presence of BOO was significantly correlated to a large prostate volume, another independent predictor of PBx outcome, we tested whether these parameters could be used to identify, in the subset of patients with PSA≤10 ng/mL, those who could potentially be spared from a PBx. If we would have not biopsied patients with BOO and prostate volume ≥60 mL, 14.5% of biopsies could have been avoided while missing only 6% of tumors. Only 10% of the tumors that would have been missed were high-risk cancers.In conclusion, in men undergoing PBx, the absence of BOO, as determined by a PFR ≥10 mL/s, is an independent risk factor for PCa.

Methods:   We assigned 790 men 65 years of age or older with a serum testosterone concentration of less than 275 ng per deciliter and symptoms suggesting hypoandrogenism to receive either testosterone gel or placebo gel for 1 year. Each man participated in one or more of three trials--the Sexual Function Trial, the Physical Function Trial, and the Vitality Trial. The primary outcome of each of the individual trials was also evaluated in all participants.  Results:   Testosterone treatment increased serum testosterone levels to the mid-normal range for men 19 to 40 years of age. The increase in testosterone levels was associated with significantly increased sexual activity, as assessed by the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (P<0.001), as well as significantly increased sexual desire and erectile function.

Materials and methods:   Three prostate phantoms were used to perform 27 biopsies using transperineal MRI-TRUS fusion. All phantoms underwent 3-T MRI. The prostate contour and nine lesions were delineated onto the MRI. A 3D-US dataset was generated and fused with the MRI. Per lesion, one needle was virtually planned. The postbiopsy needle location was virtually registered. The needle trajectory was marked using an MRI-safe guidewire. Postinterventional MRI was performed. The coordinates of the lesion on preinterventional MRI, the virtually planned needle, the virtually registered needle, and the marked needle trajectory on postinterventional MRI were documented and used to calculate the planning error (PE), targeting error (TE), and overall error (OE). Using the OE in the transversal plane, an upper one-sided tolerance interval was calculated to assess the likelihood that a biopsy needle was on target.  Results:   In the transversal plane, the mean PE, TE, and OE were 1.18, 0.39, and 2.33 mm, respectively. Using a single biopsy core, the likelihood that lesions with a diameter of 2 mm can be accurately targeted is 26%; lesions of 3 mm 61%; lesions of 4 mm 86%; lesions of 5 mm 96%; and lesions of 6 mm 99%.

However, the nature of this growth inhibition and the interactive influence of androgens are not well defined and are the subject of this report. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were cultured and treated with a range of 9cRA concentrations for 3-6 days in the absence or presence of 5α-dehydrotestosterone. 9cRA inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, plateauing at 10 mol/l. Treatment of cells with 10 mol/l 9cRA inhibited 5α-dihydroxytestosterone (DHT)-stimulated proliferation, the effect of which was maximal at 10 mol/l DHT. Treatment of DHT (10 mol/l)-exposed cells with 9cRA caused a dose-dependent increase in prostate-specific antigen in the medium after 6 days, but not 3 days. 9cRA caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic cells stained with H33258 after 3 days, but not 6 days; however, on using flow cytometry, apoptosis was apparent at both 3 and 6 days. Flow cytometry also revealed interference of G0/G1 to S phase transition by 9cRA. Inhibition by 9cRA of anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells was also found; LNCaP cells did not grow colonies in soft agar. 9cRA inhibited growth and induced differentiation of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro and inhibited anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells. Because 9cRA and 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is retinoic acid receptor-selective, prevent prostate carcinogenesis in rats, and 13-cis-retinoic acid also inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cells, the RAR is a potential molecular target for prostate cancer prevention and therapy.""","""['Jillian N Eskra', 'Jan W Kuiper', 'Paul D Walden', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Nur Özten']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Control of LNCaP proliferation and differentiation: actions and interactions of androgens, 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and phenylacetate.', 'Effect of retinoic acid on the proliferation and secretory activity of androgen-responsive prostatic carcinoma cells.', 'Androgen and retinoic acid interaction in LNCaP cells, effects on cell proliferation and expression of retinoic acid receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor.', 'Experimental studies with liarozole (R 75,251): an antitumoral agent which inhibits retinoic acid breakdown.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Repurposed Drugs in Gastric Cancer.', 'Genomic Insights into Non-steroidal Nuclear Receptors in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Characterizing isoform switching events in esophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Retinoids as anti-cancer agents and their mechanisms of action.', 'Metabolomics and Proteomics Reveal the Variation of Substances in Apheresis Platelets during Storage and Their Effects on Cancer Cell Proliferation.']"""

Molecular signatures of candidate PCa antigen biomarkers were identified and analyzed for ethnic group variation. Potential cancer diagnostic and immunotherapeutic inferences were drawn. We identified a total of 41 potential diagnostic/therapeutic antigen biomarkers for PCa. By linear quantitation, four antigens, GAGE1, ROPN1, SPANXA1 and PRKCZ were found to have higher autoantibody titres in PCa serum as compared with BPH where MAGEB1 and PRKCZ were highly expressed. Also, p53 S15A and p53 S46A were found highly expressed in the disease control group. Statistical analysis by differential expression revealed twenty-four antigens as upregulated in PCa samples, while 11 were downregulated in comparison to BPH and DC (FDR = 0.01). FGFR2, COL6A1and CALM1 were verifiable biomarkers of PCa analysis using urinary shotgun proteomics.

However, whether androgen receptor (AR) signals contributed to the preventive effect of ADT remained unclear because ADT could reduce serum estrogens as well. The purpose of this study is to investigate the associations between the expression of AR/estrogen receptors (ERs) and BC recurrence in patients treated with ADT. We immunohistochemically stained 72 BCs and 42 corresponding normal urothelial tissues. AR/ERα/ERβ were positive in 44(61%)/22(31%)/39(54%) tumors and 35(83%)/24(57%)/34(81%) corresponding normal urothelial tissues, respectively. There were no statistically significant correlations between AR/ERα/ERβ expression and clinicopathological features of BC. With a median follow-up of 31.3 months, 12 (43%) of 28 patients with AR-negative tumor versus 11 (23%) of 44 patients with AR-positive tumor experienced BC recurrence. Thus, patients with AR-positive tumor had a significantly lower risk of BC recurrence (P=0.031), compared with those with AR-negative tumor. Meanwhile, the expression of ERα/ERβ in tumors and that of AR/ERα/ERβ in normal urothelial tissues were not significantly correlated with BC recurrence. A multivariate analysis revealed AR positivity in tumors as an independent prognosticator (hazard ratio: 0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.67) for BC recurrence.

While enhanced SPDEF expression blocks migration and invasion, knockdown of SPDEF expression enhances migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. SPDEF expression and activation is tightly regulated in cancer cells; however, the precise mechanism of SPDEF regulation has not been explored in detail. In this study we provide evidence that the cell cycle kinase CDK11p58, a protein involved in G2/M transition and degradation of several transcription factors, directly interacts with and phosphorylates SPDEF on serine residues, leading to subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of SPDEF through the proteasome pathway. As a consequence of CDK11p58 mediated degradation of SPDEF, this loss of SPDEF protein results in increased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. In contrast, knockdown of CDK11p58 protein expression by interfering RNA or SPDEF overexpression inhibit migration and invasion of cancer cells. We demonstrate that CDK11p58 mediated degradation of SPDEF is attenuated by Growth Arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) α and , two proteins inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. We show that GADD45 α and γ, directly interact with CDK11p58 and thereby inhibit CDK11p58 activity, and consequentially SPDEF phosphorylation and degradation, ultimately reducing prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.

Using demographic, tumor, and clinical characteristics, we trained risk scores on the basis of GCE versus Cox models for cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. In test sets, we examined the predictive ability of the risk scores on the different causes of death, including second cancer mortality, noncancer mortality, and cause-specific mortality, using Fine-Gray regression and area under the curve. We compared how well models stratified subpopulations according to the ratio of the cumulative cause-specific hazard for cancer mortality to the cumulative hazard for overall mortality (ω) using the Akaike Information Criterion.  Results:   In each sample, increasing GCE risk scores were associated with increased cancer-specific mortality and decreased competing mortality, whereas risk scores from Cox models were associated with both increased cancer-specific mortality and competing mortality. GCE models created greater separation in the area under the curve for cancer-specific mortality versus noncancer mortality (P < .001), indicating better discriminatory ability between these events.

It seems plausible that this mutation could also predispose to other cancers. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CHEK2*1100delC heterozygosity is associated with increased risk for other cancers in addition to breast cancer in the general population.  Patients and methods:   We examined 86,975 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study, recruited from 2003 through 2010. The participants completed a questionnaire on health and lifestyle, were examined physically, had blood drawn for DNA extraction, were tested for presence of CHEK2*1100delC using Taqman assays and sequencing, and were linked over 1943 through 2011 to the Danish Cancer Registry. Incidences and risks of individual cancer types, including breast cancer, were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Fine and Gray competing-risks regressions, and stratified analyses with interaction tests.  Results:   Among 86,975 individuals, 670 (0.8%) were CHEK2*1100delC heterozygous, 2,442 developed breast cancer, and 6,635 developed other cancers. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for CHEK2*1100delC heterozygotes compared with noncarriers was 2.08 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.85) for breast cancer and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.82) for other cancers. When stratifying for sex, the age-adjusted hazard ratios for other cancers were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.18) for women and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.85) for men (sex difference: P = .63).

The clinical utility of genetic risk profiles depends on the number and effect size of identified loci, and how stable the predicted risks are as additional loci are discovered. Changes in risk classification for individuals over time would undermine the validity of common genetic variation for risk prediction. In this analysis, we quantified reclassification of genetic risk based on past and anticipated future GWAS data.  Methods:   We identified disease-associated SNPs via the NHGRI GWAS catalog and recent large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). We calculated the genomic risk for a simulated cohort of 100,000 individuals based on a multiplicative odds ratio model using cumulative GWAS-identified SNPs at four time points: 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Individuals were classified as Higher Risk (population adjusted odds >2), Average Risk (between 0.5 and 2), and Lower Risk (<0.5) for each time point and we compared classifications between time points for breast cancer (BrCa), prostate cancer (PrCa), diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D), and cardiovascular heart disease (CHD). We estimated future reclassification using the anticipated number of undiscovered SNPs.  Results:   Risk reclassification occurred for all four phenotypes from 2007 to 2013. During the most recent interval (2011-2013), the degree of risk reclassification ranged from 16.3 % for CHD to 24.4 % for PrCa. Many individuals classified as Higher Risk at earlier time points were subsequently reclassified into a lower risk category. From 2011 to 2013, the degree of such downward risk reclassification ranged from 24.9% for T2D to 55% for CHD. The percent of individuals classified as Higher Risk increased as more SNPs were discovered, ranging from an increase of 5% for CHD to 9% for PrCa from 2007 to 2013. Reclassification continued to occur when we modeled the discovery of anticipated SNPs based on doubling current sample size.  Conclusion:   Risk estimates from common genetic variation show large reclassification rates. Identifying disease-associated SNPs facilitates the clinically relevant task of identifying higher-risk individuals. However, the large amount of reclassification that we demonstrated in individuals initially classified as Higher Risk but later as Average Risk or Lower Risk, suggests that caution is currently warranted in basing clinical decisions on common genetic variation for many complex diseases.""","""['Joel Krier', 'Richard Barfield', 'Robert C Green', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Computational analyses of type 2 diabetes-associated loci identified by genome-wide association studies.', 'Literature-based genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease: the Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) prospective cohort study.', ""Shared genetic etiology underlying Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes."", 'Functional annotation of sixty-five type-2 diabetes risk SNPs and its application in risk prediction.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Polygenic risk scores: An overview from bench to bedside for personalised medicine.', 'Impact of returning unsolicited genomic results to nongenetic health care providers in the eMERGE III Network.', 'Guideline for feedback of individual genetic research findings for genomics research in Africa.', 'WHY WE FEAR GENETIC INFORMANTS: USING GENETIC GENEALOGY TO CATCH SERIAL KILLERS.', 'Variable selection in social-environmental data: sparse regression and tree ensemble machine learning approaches.']"""

Currently, the experimental focus has been on particle design and not the biological system. Here, we varied tumor volume to determine whether cancer pathophysiology can influence tumor accumulation and penetration of different sized nanoparticles. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to model the process of nanoparticle accumulation. We discovered that changes in pathophysiology associated with tumor volume can selectively change tumor uptake of nanoparticles of varying size. We further determine that nanoparticle retention within tumors depends on the frequency of interaction of particles with the perivascular extracellular matrix for smaller nanoparticles, whereas transport of larger nanomaterials is dominated by Brownian motion. These results reveal that nanoparticles can potentially be personalized according to a patient's disease state to achieve optimal diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes.""","""['Edward A Sykes', 'Qin Dai', 'Christopher D Sarsons', 'Juan Chen', 'Jonathan V Rocheleau', 'David M Hwang', 'Gang Zheng', 'David T Cramb', 'Kristina D Rinker', 'Warren C W Chan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Investigating the impact of nanoparticle size on active and passive tumor targeting efficiency.', 'Effect of removing Kupffer cells on nanoparticle tumor delivery.', 'Influence of photon beam energy on the dose enhancement factor caused by gold and silver nanoparticles: An experimental approach.', 'The application of gold nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic approach in breast and ovarian cancer.', 'Metal-based nanoparticle interactions with the nervous system: the challenge of brain entry and the risk of retention in the organism.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and Therapeutic Efficacy of 177Lu-DMSA@SPIONs in Nanobrachytherapy of Solid Tumors.', 'Selective Blood Cell Hitchhiking in Whole Blood with Ionic Liquid-Coated PLGA Nanoparticles to Redirect Biodistribution After Intravenous Injection.', 'Spatial analysis of nanoparticle distribution in human breast xenografts reveals nanoparticles targeted to cancer cells localized with tumor-associated stromal cells.', 'Current Principles, Challenges, and New Metrics in pH-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Cancer Therapy.', 'Strategies for Delivering Nanoparticles across Tumor Blood Vessels.']"""

Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic significance of UHRF1.  Method:   UHRF1 expression in PCa cells was monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses.

In this study, anticancer and antiproliferative mechanism of biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles was determined on human prostate cancer cell lines.  Main methods:   In vitro anticancer efficacy of biopolymer coated As2O3 NPs was investigated in LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines, by assessing DNA damage, changes in epigenetic modulations, expression level of apoptotic markers and cell cycle analysis following treatment with As2O3 NPs.  Key findings:   Our results demonstrate that the nanoparticulate formulation of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and chitosan coated As2O3 is capable of inducing morphological changes, DNA damage and caspase-dependent apoptosis along with the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor - p21 was found to be triggered by changes in epigenetic modifications at histone tails.  Significance:   Biopolymer coated As2O3 nanoparticles induced reversal of mono, di and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 residue. Acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 residue and phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 residue synergistically activated p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene thereby leading to apoptosis in the LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Treatment with As2O3 nanoparticles arrested the cells in G0-G1 and G2-M phase of cell cycle in LNCaP and PC-3 cells respectively. Thus, biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles with reduced toxicity to normal cells but the antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer cell lines follow similar death pathway as that of bare As2O3 nanoparticles.""","""['Vaibhav Jadhav', 'Pritha Ray', 'Geetanjali Sachdeva', 'Purvi Bhatt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Essential role of cell cycle regulatory genes p21 and p27 expression in inhibition of breast cancer cells by arsenic trioxide.', 'Arsenic trioxide-mediated growth inhibition in MC/CAR myeloma cells via cell cycle arrest in association with induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and apoptosis.', 'Arsenic trioxide induces cell cycle arrest and alters DNA methylation patterns of cell cycle regulatory genes in colorectal cancer cells.', 'The effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on human megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines.

Many two-phase case-control studies involve biased sampling of cases and/or controls in the second phase. For example, controls are often frequency-matched to cases with respect to other covariates. Ignoring biased sampling of cases and/or controls can lead to biased inference regarding biomarkers' classification accuracy. Considering the problems of estimating and comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for a binary disease outcome, the impact of biased sampling of cases and/or controls on inference and the strategy to efficiently account for the sampling scheme have not been well studied. In this project, we investigate the inverse-probability-weighted method to adjust for biased sampling in estimating and comparing AUC. Asymptotic properties of the estimator and its inference procedure are developed for both Bernoulli sampling and finite-population stratified sampling. In simulation studies, the weighted estimators provide valid inference for estimation and hypothesis testing, while the standard empirical estimators can generate invalid inference.

Proton therapy (PT) may offer advantages over other local therapeutic options. This article reviews a single institution's experience using PT for salvage of local recurrent disease after HIFU or CS.  Methods and materials:   We reviewed the medical records of 21 consecutive patients treated with salvage PT following a local recurrence of prostate cancer after CS (n=12) or HIFU (n=9) between January 2007 and July 2014. Patients were treated to a median dose of 74 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]; range: 74-82 Gy[RBE]) and 8 patients received androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy. Patients were evaluated for quality of life (QOL) by using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite questionnaire and toxicity by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, weekly during treatment, every 6 months for 2 years after treatment, and then annually.  Results:   Median follow-up was 37 months (range: 6-95 months). The 3-year biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) rate was 77%. The 3-year grade 3 toxicity rate was 17%; however, 2 of these patients had pre-existing grade 3 GU toxicities from their HIFU/CRYO prior to PT. At 1 year, bowel summary, urinary incontinence, and urinary obstructive QOL scores declined, but only the bowel QOL score at 12 months met the minimally important difference threshold.  Conclusions:   PT achieved a high rate of bPFS with acceptable toxicity and minimal changes in QOL scores compared with baseline pre-PT functions. Although most patients have done fairly well, the study size is small, follow-up is short, and early results suggest that outcomes with PT for salvage after HIFU or CS failure are inferior to outcomes with PT given in the de novo setting with respect to disease control, toxicity, and QOL.""","""['Adam L Holtzman', 'Bradford S Hoppe', 'Haley P Letter', 'Curtis Bryant', 'Romaine C Nichols', 'Randal H Henderson', 'William M Mendenhall', 'Christopher G Morris', 'Christopher R Williams', 'Zuofeng Li', 'Nancy P Mendenhall']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Five-Year Biochemical Results, Toxicity, and Patient-Reported Quality of Life After Delivery of Dose-Escalated Image Guided Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients.', '11C choline PET guided salvage radiotherapy with volumetric modulation arc therapy and hypofractionation for recurrent prostate cancer after HIFU failure: preliminary results of tolerability and acute toxicity.', 'Salvage Therapy Options for Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Primary Radiotherapy: a Literature Review.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Comparing the toxicity and disease control rate of radiotherapy for prostate cancer between salvage settings after high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy and initial settings.', 'Letter to the editor in response to Hopper et\xa0al, ""Salvage image guided radiation therapy to the prostate after cryotherapy failure"".']"""

The role of SREBP-2 in lethal prostate cancer (PCa) progression remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that expression of SREBP-2 was elevated in advanced pathologic grade and metastatic PCa and significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Biofunctional analyses demonstrated that SREBP-2 induced PCa cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, overexpression of SREBP-2 increased the PCa stem cell population, prostasphere-forming ability and tumor-initiating capability, whereas genetic silencing of SREBP-2 inhibited PCa cell growth, stemness, and xenograft tumor growth and metastasis. Clinical and mechanistic data showed that SREBP-2 was positively correlated with c-Myc and induced c-Myc activation by directly interacting with an SREBP-2-binding element in the 5'-flanking c-Myc promoter region to drive stemness and metastasis.

Here, we assessed the usefulness of the BSI as a prognostic factor in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated using docetaxel.  Methods:   We analyzed 41 patients who received docetaxel for mCRPC. The Bonenavi system was used as the calculation program for the BSI. The utility of the BSI as a predictor of overall survival (OS) after docetaxel was evaluated. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the association between clinical variables obtained at docetaxel treatment, namely PSA, patient age, liver metastasis, local therapy, hemoglobin (Hb), lactase dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin (Alb), PSA doubling time, and BSI and OS.  Results:   The median OS after docetaxel therapy was 17.7 months. Death occurred in 22 (53.7%) patients; all deaths were caused by prostate cancer. In multivariate analysis, three factors were identified as significant independent prognostic biomarkers for OS after docetaxel; these were liver metastases (yes vs no; HR, 3.681; p = 0.026), Alb (<3.9 vs ≥ 3.9; HR, 3.776; p = 0.020), and BSI (>1% vs ≤ 1%; HR, 3.356; p = 0.037). We evaluated the discriminatory ability of our models including or excluding the BSI by quantifying the c-index. The BSI improved the c-index from 0.758 to 0.769 for OS after docetaxel. CRPC patients with a BSI >1 had a significantly shorter OS than patients with a BSI ≤ 1 (p = 0.029).

Although there are several therapies successful in treating early, localized stage prostate cancer, current treatment of advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains ineffective due to inevitable progression of resistance to first-line treatment with docetaxel. The natural product quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone), a flavonoid compound ubiquitous in dietary plants, possesses evidenced potential in treating advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, its poor bioavailability and moderate potency hinder its advancement into clinical therapy. In order to engineer quercetin derivatives with improved potency and pharmacokinetic profiles for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate cancer, we started this study with creating a small library of alkylated derivatives of quercetin for in vitro evaluation. The biological data and chemical reactivity of quercetin and its derivatives reported in literature directed us to design 3,4',7-O-trialkylquercetins as our first batch of targets. Consequently, nine 3,4',7-O-trialkylquercetins, together with four 3,7-O- dialkylquercetins, four 3,3',4',7-tetraalkylquercetins, and one 3,3',4'-O-trialkylquercetin, were prepared by one step O-alkylation of commercially available quercetin mediated by potassium carbonate. Their structures were determined by ID and 2D NMR data, and HRMS. Their anti-proliferative activities towards both androgen-refractory and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells were evaluated using WST-1 cell proliferation assay. The acquired structure-activity relationships indicate that 3,7-O-dialkylquercetins rather than 3,4',7-O-trialkylquercetins were much more potent than quercetin towards prostate cancer cells.""","""['Sami M R Al-Jabban', 'Xiaojie Zhang', 'Guanglin Chen', 'Ermias Addo Mekuria', 'Liva Harinantenaina Rakotondraibe', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Nat Prod Commun""","""['Nitrogen-containing derivatives of O-tetramethylquercetin: Synthesis and biological profiles in prostate cancer cell models.', 'A new class of flavonol-based anti-prostate cancer agents: Design, synthesis, and evaluation in cell models.', 'Aerobic Decomposition of Trialkylquercetins: Structure Characterization and Antiproliferative Effect.', 'Nanoparticle-delivered quercetin for cancer therapy.', 'Application of Bioactive Quercetin in Oncotherapy: From Nutrition to Nanomedicine.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Novel Quercetin Derivative of 3,7-Dioleylquercetin Shows Less Toxicity and Highly Potent Tyrosinase Inhibition Activity.', 'Antileishmanial Activity of Lignans, Neolignans, and Other Plant Phenols.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.', 'Nitrogen-containing derivatives of O-tetramethylquercetin: Synthesis and biological profiles in prostate cancer cell models.']"""

However, comparing baseline scores to follow-up scores is only justified if patients' internal measurement standards have not changed over time, that is, no response shift occurred. We aimed to examine response shift in terms of reconceptualization, reprioritization and recalibration among prostate cancer patients. Material and methods We included 402 newly diagnosed patients (mean age 65 years) and assessed QoL at the beginning of cancer treatment and three months later. QoL was measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). We employed structural equation modeling testing measurement invariance between occasions to disentangle 'true' change and change in the measurement model (response shift). Results We found reprioritization effects for both the Physical Functioning and Role Functioning subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, indicating that both had gained importance for representing the latent construct of QoL at follow-up. These effects added to the worsening effect evident in the latent construct, thus rendering observed changes even more pronounced. In addition, we found recalibration effects for both the Emotional Functioning and Cognitive Functioning subscales indicating judgments becoming more lenient over time. These effects counteracted 'true' negative changes thus obscuring any substantial changes on the observed level. Conclusion Our results suggest that changes observed in some subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 should not be taken at face value as they may be affected by patients' changed measurement standards.""","""['Christian Gerlich', 'Michael Schuler', 'Matthias Jelitte', 'Silke Neuderth', 'Michael Flentje', 'Markus Graefen', 'Alexander Krüger', 'Anja Mehnert', 'Hermann Faller']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Response Shift-Adjusted Treatment Effect on Health-Related Quality of Life in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Taxane Versus S-1 for Metastatic Breast Cancer: Structural Equation Modeling.', 'The relationship of changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 scores to ratings on the Subjective Significance Questionnaire in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Consistency matters: measurement invariance of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire in patients with hematologic malignancies.', 'Quality of life in patients with primary and metastatic brain cancer as reported in the literature using the EORTC QLQ-BN20 and QLQ-C30.', ""To what extent can response shift theory explain the variation in prostate cancer patients' reactions to treatment side-effects?

Reactivity and spectroscopic data reveal that complex 1 is able to release N3(-) either after reduction with ascorbic acid, or by ambient light irradiation, in aqueous phosphate buffer (pH6.2, 7.0 and 7.4) and acetonitrile solutions. The antitumoral activities of compounds 1-3 were tested in normoxia on MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (human prostate) and A-549 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial) cell lines, after 24h of exposure. Either complexes or NaN3 presented IC50 values higher than 200 μM, showing lower cytotoxicity than the clinical standard antitumoral complex cisplatin, under the same conditions. Complexes 1-3 were also evaluated in hypoxia on A-549 and results indicate high IC50 data (>200 μM) after 24h of exposure. However, an increase of cancer cell susceptibility to 1 and 2 was observed at 300 μM. Regarding complex 3, no cytotoxic activity was observed in the same conditions. The data presented here indicate that the tridentate ligand L is able to stabilize both oxidation states of cobalt (+3 and +2).

Currently, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers that can accurately predict patient outcome and improve the treatment strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of PCDH10 in serum of prostate cancer patients and its potential relevance to clinicopathological features and prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The methylation status of PCDH10 in serum of 171 primary prostate cancer patients and 65 controls was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), after which the relationship between PCDH10 methylation and clinicopathologic features was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between PCDH10 methylation and prognosis. RESULTS PCDH10 methylation occurred frequently in serum of prostate cancer patients. Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was significantly associated with higher preoperative PSA level, advanced clinical stage, higher Gleason score, lymph node metastasis, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). In addition, patients with methylated PCDH10 had shorter BCR-free survival and overall survival than patients with unmethylated PCDH10.

Aims:   This study is to explore whether MSC induces apoptosis in prostate cancer (PCa) cells DU145 through connexin 43 (Cx43) activation.  Settings and design:   The experiment was performed in a PCa cell line model DU145 and using a series of biological assay methods to investigate the regulating pathway from MSC through Cx43 to downstream molecules, demonstrating an important role of Cx43 in PCa development and as a potential treatment target.  Materials and methods:   The human PCa cell line DU145 was used as a model. The effects of MSC on Cx43 expression were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot; effects on cell growth and proliferation were determined by WST-1 and colony formation assay; small interfering ribonucleic acid was used to evaluate the direct contribution of Cx43 to cancer cell apoptosis.  Statistical analysis used:   Student's t-test was used to calculate the difference between the groups in SPSS software.  Results:   Results showed that MSC inhibited the growth and colony formation of the DU145 cells; MSC induced cell apoptosis by increasing Cx43 expression at messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels; MSC decreased B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased bad levels of DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   As a conclusion, MSC exerts pro-apoptosis effects through increasing Cx43 expression, which in turn down-regulates Bcl-2 and up-regulates bad expression.""","""['Zhong Lu', 'Li Qi', 'Gui-Xin Li', 'Xue-Jun Bo', 'Guo-Dong Liu', 'Jun-Ming Wang']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Effects of Se-methylselenocysteine on biological behavior of and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Analysis of Selenium Levels in Osteosarcoma Patients and the Effects of Se-Methylselenocysteine on Osteosarcoma Cells In Vitro.', 'Triptolide inhibits the multidrug resistance in prostate cancer cells via the downregulation of MDR1 expression.', 'Differential response of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation: role of reactive oxygen species, GSH and Nrf2 in radiosensitivity.', 'Connexin-43 regulates p38-mediated cell migration and invasion induced selectively in tumour cells by low doses of γ-radiation in an ERK-1/2-independent manner.', 'Chemopreventive and Anticancer Property of Selenoproteins in Obese Breast Cancer.', 'Direct Intercellular Communications and Cancer: A Snapshot of the Biological Roles of Connexins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Organoids Increase the Predictive Value of in vitro Cancer Chemoprevention Studies for in vivo Outcome.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data were collected prospectively from all patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and managed in a urology unit in Sri Lanka from January 2010 to December 2013. Patient's age, clinical presentation, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, mode of diagnosis, Gleason sum score, stage of the disease and main modality of treatment were recorded and analyzed.  Results:   There were 278 cases of histologically proven prostate cancer. Mean patient age was 70.5 years. About 50% presented with lower urinary tract symptoms. Only 2% were screening detected cases. Five (2%) patients had a first-degree relative who had prostate cancer. About 81% of patients had a serum PSA above 20 ng/ml. Gleason sum score was 8 or more in 44% of patients. Metastases were found at the time of diagnosis in 60% of patients. Forty-eight patients underwent radical radiotherapy, while seven patients had radical prostatectomy. Most (94%) of the 203 patients who required androgen deprivation therapy had surgical orchiectomy.  Conclusions:   Sri Lankans appear to be having a low incidence of prostate cancer, but a larger proportion of high-grade cancers in comparison to the UK and USA.

Materials and methods Registry data were collected for time trends and national distribution of prostate cancer surgery in Finland, while preoperative, operative and follow-up data were collected for quality measures. Results The number and proportion of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALPs) increased rapidly and they accounted for 68% of all radical prostatectomies in 2012. The number of centers performing prostatectomies diminished from 25 to 20 at the expense of low-volume centers. In total, 1996 patients were operated on in the four RALP centers in 2008-2012. As anticipated, the learning curve was uniform between the centers, as were mean blood loss (212 ml), hospitalization (1.8 days) and catheterization times (10.6 days). At 3 and 12 months, 49.4% and 71.2% of patients, respectively, were totally continent (no pads). After unilateral nerve-sparing surgery, 9.9% and 5.1% had partial or normal erection at 3 months postoperatively and 14.8% and 20.4% at 12 months, respectively. If bilateral nerve sparing was done, the figures were 13.0% and 13.5% at 3 months and 14.6% and 34.9% at 12 months. Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 or 5 complications were seen in 0.3%, 0.3% and 0.1% of patients, respectively. Limitations of the study include non-standardized collection of outcome parameters.

To investigate prostate cancer susceptibility in the under-investigated Chinese population, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on a cohort of Chinese cases and controls and then meta-analysis with data from the existing Chinese prostate cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping 211,155 SNPs in 495 cases and 640 controls of Chinese ancestry identified several new suggestive Chinese prostate cancer predisposition loci. However, none of them reached genome-wide significance level either by meta-analysis or replication study. The meta-analysis with the Chinese GWAS data revealed that four 8q24 loci are the main contributors to Chinese prostate cancer risk and the risk alleles from three of them exist at much higher frequencies in Chinese than European populations. We also found that several predisposition loci reported in Western populations have different effect on Chinese men. Therefore, this first extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism study of Chinese prostate cancer in comparison with European population indicates that four loci on 8q24 contribute to a great risk of prostate cancer in a considerable large proportion of Chinese men. Based on those four loci, the top 10% of the population have six- or two-fold prostate cancer risk compared with men of the bottom 10% or median risk respectively, which may facilitate the design of prostate cancer genetic risk screening and prevention in Chinese men.

Genetically, a key difference between these two mechanisms is that the latter results in deletion of a ∼3-Mb interstitial region containing genes with unexplored roles in prostate cancer. In this study, we characterized two mouse models recapitulating TMPRSS2-ERG insertion or deletion events in the background of prostate-specific PTEN deficiency. We found that only the mice that lacked the interstitial region developed prostate adenocarcinomas marked by poor differentiation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic investigations identified several interstitial genes, including Ets2 and Bace2, whose reduced expression correlated in the gene homologs in human prostate cancer with biochemical relapse and lethal disease. Accordingly, PTEN-deficient mice with prostate-specific knockout of Ets2 exhibited marked progression of prostate adenocarcinomas that was partly attributed to activation of MAPK signaling. Collectively, our findings established that Ets2 is a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, and its loss along with other genes within the TMPRSS2-ERG interstitial region contributes to disease progression.

In the search for other complimentary markers, we focused on serum IgG from patients with prostate diseases as well as normal subjects. IgG purified from the sera of normal control subjects and patients with prostate diseases, was digested with peptide N-glycanase. Released glycans were quantified using MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometry. We report that N-linked (N-acetylhexosamine)2 (deoxyhexose)(mannose)3 (N-acetylglucosamine)2 was significantly increased in the IgG heavy chains of patients with prostate cancer compared with that of either benign prostatic disease patients or healthy subjects, whereas (hexose)(N-acetylhexosamine)2 (deoxyhexose)(mannose)3 (N-acetylglucosamine)2 was more abundant in the heavy chains of healthy subjects and benign prostatic disease patients. Thus, an absence of the terminal hexose of N-linked glycans has been closely connected to the progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance analyses have revealed that IgG from patients with prostate cancer has a decreased binding for Sambucus nigra lectin, compared with that from the benign prostatic disease patients or from normal subjects, suggesting lower levels of (N-acetylneuraminic acid)(α2-6)galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine groups in the N-linked glycans of patient IgG. Meanwhile, wheat germ agglutinin binding to IgG of the cancer group was significantly larger than that for the benign prostatic disease group but smaller than that for normal subjects.

Patients and methods:   Men with prostate cancer considered suitable for discharge were identified from consultant-led and clinical nurse-specialist telephone clinics at Nottingham University Hospitals National Health Service Trust. Patients were discharged on to one of four discharge pathways: watchful waiting, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), post-prostatectomy, and post-radiotherapy. Primary care providers were asked to adhere to specific surveillance measures and refer patients back to secondary care after breach of pre-defined prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level threshold criteria. Reasons for non-compliance, re-referral, and cause of death were determined for all discharged men.  Results:   In all, 573 men were discharged across all four pathways; 169 on the watchful-waiting pathway, 229 on the ADT pathway, 95 on the post-prostatectomy pathway, and 80 on the post-radiotherapy pathway. All patients had ≥12 months of follow-up. In all, 48 of 54 (88.9%) men were re-referred promptly after a PSA-threshold breach. Of the remaining six patients there were three refusals, one unrelated death before referral, and two late referrals at 4 months. Three patients were lost to follow-up due to database non-registration and were subsequently recalled, none of whom had a PSA-threshold breach. There were three unexpected deaths attributed to prostate cancer: two were community deaths with no biochemical or clinical evidence of prostate cancer progression, while one was due to a likely progressive PSA non-secreting tumour.  Conclusion:   Initial results suggest the algorithm-based protocol is a viable, effective, and oncologically safe method for the controlled discharge of men from secondary to primary care.

Background:   We developed a decision aid that fits the preferences of patients and health care professionals to ensure adequate uptake in clinical practice.  Design:   A participatory design approach was used to acquire insight into preferences regarding the content and design of a decision aid and into barriers and aspects of the decision aid that facilitate implementation in clinical practice.  Methods:   Three focus group interviews with patients, their partners and health care professionals were conducted. A prototype of the decision aid was developed and presented to patients (n = 14) and health care professionals (n = 13) in semi-structured interviews. Patients (n = 5) participated in a usability study. Data were analysed by two independent coders.  Results:   Health care professionals considered medical information on treatments and side effects as the most important aspect to be included in the decision aid. Patients also focused on nonmedical considerations, such as location. Both expected the decision aid to support patients in making a treatment choice. According to health care professionals, the oncology nurse was the most suitable to discuss the decision aid with patients, while some patients preferred to discuss the patient decision aid with the urologist. The main barrier to implementation of the decision aid was said to be the expectation that it is time and money consuming, while the incorporation of the decision aid into clinical guidelines and basing the content on these guidelines, would promote implementation.

We assessed PET-positive MLN, which are indicative for PCa.  Results:   We detected PET-positive lesions for PCa in (68) Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in 66 of 76 (87%) patients. Nodal disease was imaged in 47 of 66 (71%) patients. Indicative mesorectal nodal lesions for PCa were detected in 12 of 76 (15.8%) patients. The median number of PET-positive MLN was one per patient. Seven of twelve patients had recurrent PCa after radical prostatectomy with a median PSA value of 1.84 ng/ml (range 0.31-13). Five of twelve patients had untreated first diagnosed high-risk PCa with median PSA value of 90 ng/ml (range 4.6-93) at PET/CT, respectively. For all PET positive MLN a morphological correlate was found in CT (shortest diameter median 4 mm [range 4-21]; longest diameter median 7.5 mm [range 5-25]). After PET/CT, four patients with recurrent PCa received hormonal therapy, one patient was treated with directed radiation therapy of MLN, one patient received chemotherapy, and one patient was treated with pelvic lymph node dissection. Three high-risk PCa patients received hormonal therapy, and two patients were treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy after radical prostatectomy.

Among the 30 patients with a normal prostate specific antigen (less than 4.0 ng/ml) the positive predictive value in those with a magnetic resonance imaging score of 4 or more was 66.7% (6 of 9) and the negative predictive value in those with a magnetic resonance imaging score of 3 or less was 85.7% (18 of 21, p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   In this pilot study we determined the feasibility of using multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging as the primary screening test for prostate cancer.

We investigated the detection rate of prostate cancer on repeat fusion biopsy in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging lesions initially found to be pathologically benign on fusion biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of all patients from 2007 to 2014 who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and image guided fusion biopsy. We identified men who underwent rebiopsy of the same discrete lesion after initial fusion biopsy results were benign. Data were documented on a per lesion basis. We manually reviewed UroNav system (Invivo, Gainesville, Florida) needle tracking to verify accurate image registration. Multivariate analysis was used to identify clinical and imaging factors predictive of prostate cancer detection at repeat fusion biopsy.  Results:   A total of 131 unique lesions were rebiopsied in 90 patients. Of these 131 resampled lesions 21 (16%) showed prostate cancer, which in 13 (61.9%) was Gleason 3 + 3. On multivariate analysis only lesion growth on repeat multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was significantly associated with prostate cancer detection at repeat biopsy (HR 3.274, 95% CI 1.205-8.896, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Pathologically benign multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging lesions on initial image guided fusion biopsy are rarely found to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. When prostate cancer was identified, most disease was low risk. An increase in lesion diameter was an independent predictor of prostate cancer detection. While these data are retrospective, they may provide some confidence in the reliability of negative initial image guided fusion biopsies despite a positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging finding.""","""['Raju Chelluri', 'Amichai Kilchevsky', 'Arvin K George', 'Abhinav Sidana', 'Thomas P Frye', 'Daniel Su', 'Michele Fascelli', 'Richard Ho', 'Steven F Abboud', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Anterior Localization of Prostate Cancer Suspicious Lesions in 1,161 Patients Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsies.', 'A Single Center Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging against Transperineal Prostate Mapping Biopsy: An Analysis of Men with Benign Histology and Insignificant Cancer following Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of the Prostate-An Update.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

Methods:   PC-3 and LNCap human prostate cancer cells were exposed to α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists (0.01-100 μM) and cell survival assessed after 24-72 hr. The levels of apoptosis, autophagy and stress related proteins were also determined.  Results:   The relative cytotoxic potency order was prazosin = doxazosin > terazosin = silodosin = alfuzosin > tamsulosin on both cell types, but LNCaP cells were significantly more sensitive to these effects than PC-3 cells. Prazosin and doxazosin increased levels of apoptotsis and autophagy in both cell lines, and activated EphA2 receptors in PC-3 cells. Autophagy contributed to survival of LNCaP, but promoted cell death in PC-3 cells. Treatment with prazosin (30 μM) altered the expression of several cell stress-related proteins: elevating phospho-p38α and reducing S6 kinase in both cell lines. Surprisingly some proteins were differentially affected in the two prostate cancer cell lines: Akt and p27 increasing and HIF-1α decreasing in LNCap cells but not PC-3, while ADAMTS1 was increased in PC-3 cells only.  Conclusions:   Prazosin and doxazosin demonstrated cytotoxic actions on both castration-resistant PC-3 and androgen-sensitive LNCap prostate cancer cells. The mechanisms involved included changes in a number of proliferation and apoptosis regulatory proteins.

We show that, in LNCaP cells, androgen deprivation induces arrest in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, and that EGF partially rescues this arrest without affecting cell death. Inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not MEK or IKK-β, completely abrogates the EGF-induced proliferation of LNCaP cells in androgen-depleted medium, and decreases the fraction of G0/G1-arrested cells.

The magnetic bar embedded in a droplet-based microfluidic system segregates the free and bound SERS tags by splitting the droplets into two smaller parts. The presence of PSA targets leads more SERS tags to immunocomplex in one droplet so that fewer SERS tags remain in another supernatant solution droplet. Thus, SERS signal measurement enables the quantitative evaluation of PSA markers. This approach can provide a rapid and sensitive assay that is applicable for PSA cancer markers in serum without any washing. Specifically, SERS signals were measured at 174 droplets per minute and averaged for quantitative evaluation of PSA. The limit of detection (LOD) determined by our SERS-based microdroplet sensor was estimated to be below 0.1 ng mL(-1), which is significantly below the clinical cut-off value for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In addition, because the entire assay can be carried out automatically, only a minimal amount of sample is needed.

Here we apply a method to group patient-reported GU symptoms after RT for localized prostate cancer based on their interplay, and study how these relate to urinary bladder dose.  Materials and methods:   Data were taken from two Scandinavian studies (N=207/276) including men treated with external-beam RT (EBRT) to 78/70Gy (2Gy/fraction; median time-to-follow-up: 3.6-6.4y). Within and across cohorts, bladder dose-volume parameters were tested as predictors for GU symptom domains identified from two study-specific questionnaires (35 questions on frequency, incontinence, obstruction, pain, urgency, and sensory symptoms) using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVA) with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was evaluated using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (Az).  Results:   For the identified Incontinence (2-5 symptoms), Obstruction (3-5 symptoms), and Urgency (2-7 symptoms) domains, MVA demonstrated that bladder doses close to the prescription doses were the strongest predictors for Obstruction (Az: 0.53-0.57) and Urgency (Az: 0.60). For Obstruction, performance increased for the across cohort analysis (Az: 0.61-0.64).

This enables cells to be more metastatic. Factors that are able to induce EMT include growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and epidermal growth factor, and transcription factors such as Snail. Snail-induced EMT promotes migration and invasion and we hypothesized that this may be mediated by the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR). LNCaP, 22Rv1 and ARCaP human prostate cancer (CaP) cells stably transfected with empty vector control (Neo) or constitutively active Snail exhibited increased cell invasion. Superarray analysis revealed an upregulation in uPA and uPAR RNA expression in Snail-transfected ARCaP cells compared with that of a Neo control. In addition, the protein expression levels of Snail, uPA and uPAR were measured by western blot analysis which showed that overexpression of Snail increased uPA and uPAR protein levels. The activity of uPA in conditioned media was measured using an ELISA which revealed that uPA activity was elevated in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and ARCaP cells overexpressing Snail. Additionally, transient silencing of uPAR in ARCaP cells overexpressing Snail using short interfering RNA resulted in abrogation of Snail-mediated invasion. Snail overexpression was associated with increased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activity, and antagonism of this activity with mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) inhibitor, UO126, inhibited cell invasion and decreased uPA activity. Therefore, Snail-mediated cell invasion in human CaP cells may occur via the regulation of uPA/uPAR and the MAPK signaling pathway.""","""['Diandra D Randle', 'Shineka Clarke', 'Veronica Henderson', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Downregulation of uPAR promotes urokinase translocation into the nucleus and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in neuroblastoma.', 'TGF-β2 promotes RPE cell invasion into a collagen gel by mediating urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression.', 'Downregulation of uPA/uPAR inhibits intermittent hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in DAOY and D283 medulloblastoma cells.', 'Mechanism of tumor cell-induced extracellular matrix degradation--inhibition of cell-surface proteolytic activity might have a therapeutic effect on tumor cell invasion and metastasis.', 'Transforming Growth Factor-Beta and Urokinase Type Plasminogen Interplay in Cancer.', 'LPAR5 confers radioresistance to cancer cells associated with EMT activation via the ERK/Snail pathway.', 'Small interfering RNA targeting N-cadherin regulates cell proliferation and migration in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Studies of hormonal regulation, phenotype plasticity, bone metastasis, and experimental therapeutics in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) model.', 'Downregulation of Snail by DUSP1 Impairs Cell Migration and Invasion through the Inactivation of JNK and ERK and Is Useful as a Predictive Factor in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Downregulation of uPAR promotes urokinase translocation into the nucleus and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in neuroblastoma.']"""

Satellites <0.5cm(3) constituted the tumor load in the CTV. Each patient's tumor control probability (TCP) was simulated using the linear quadratic model and considering the N0 while assuming either a constant or GS-dependent α and β.  Results:   19/25 patients had multi-focal disease. In 11 patients the CTV contained GS 4+3 or 4+4 tumors. Compared to the GTV, the CTV pathology was more favorable. For an α=0.140Gy(-1), a GTV dose of 79Gy with a CTV dose of 72Gy achieved an 80% TCP in the population. Varying α between 0.160-0.118Gy(-1) with GS, a GTV and CTV dose of 80Gy and 70Gy also gave an 80% TCP.

Prognostic factors influencing PCa-specific and overall survival (PCaSS & OS) are not known. The objective of this study was to develop a multivariable, internally validated prognostic model for survival after whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   Whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy patients treated in the Netherlands from 1993-2010 were included. Eligible patients had a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy-confirmed localised recurrence after biochemical failure (clinical judgement, ASTRO or Phoenix-definition). Recurrences were assessed clinically and with CT and/or MRI. Metastases were excluded using CT/MRI and technetium-99m scintigraphy. Multivariable Cox-regression was used to assess the predictive value of clinical characteristics in relation to PCa-specific and overall mortality. PCa-specific mortality was defined as patients dying with distant metastases present. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation (20 imputed sets). Internal validation was performed and the C-statistic calculated. Calibration plots were created to visually assess the goodness-of-fit of the final model. Optimism-corrected survival proportions were calculated. All analyses were performed according to the TRIPOD statement.  Results:   Median total follow-up was 78months (range 5-139). A total of 62 patients were treated, of which 28 (45%) died from PCa after mean (±SD) 82 (±36) months. Overall, 36 patients (58%) patients died after mean 84 (±40) months. PSA doubling time (PSADT) remained a predictive factor for both types of mortality (PCa-specific and overall): corrected hazard ratio's (HR's) 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98, p=0.02) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99, p=0.01), respectively (C-statistics 0.71 and 0.69, respectively). Calibration was accurate up to 96month follow-up. Over 80% of patients can survive 8years if PSADT>24months (PCaSS) and >33months (OS). Only approximately 50% survival is achieved with a PSADT of 12months.  Conclusion:   A PSADT of respectively >24months and >33months can result in >80% probability of PCa- specific and overall survival 8years after whole-gland salvage I-125-brachytherapy.

Area under the curve (AUC) and Akaike information criterion were used to identify ideal 'Cut off' for CCI.  Results:   The clinical and cancer characteristics were similar between the two groups. Comparison of the survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curve between two groups for non-cancer death and survival estimations for 5 and 10 years shows significant worst outcomes for patients with CCI ≥ 2. In multivariate model to decide the appropriate CCI cut-off point, we found CCI 2 has better AUC and p value in log rank test.

This model was validated for clinical trials presented in Michael et al. (Clin Cancer Res 11(12):4469-4478, 2005). It consists of seven ordinary differential equations and its asymptotic dynamics can be described by some t-periodic one-dimensional dynamical system. In this paper we propose a generalised version of this t-periodic system and study the dynamics of the proposed model. We show that there are three possible types of the model behaviour: the solution either converges to zero, or diverges to infinity, or it is periodic. Moreover, the periodic solution is unique, and it divides the phase space into two sub-regions. The general results are applied to the PC specific case, which allow to derive conditions guaranteeing successful as well as unsuccessful treatment.

There is growing interest in developing radiolabeled peptide-based ligands toward these receptors for the purpose of in vivo imaging and radionuclide therapy of GRP-R-overexpressing tumors. A number of different peptide sequences, isotopes, and labeling methods have been proposed for this purpose. The aim of this work is to perform a direct side-by-side comparison of different GRP-R binding peptides utilizing a single labeling strategy to identify the most suitable peptide sequence.  Methods:   Solid-phase synthesis of eight derivatives (BN1-8) designed based on literature analysis was carried out. Peptides were coupled to the DOTA chelator through a PEG4 spacer at the N-terminus. Derivatives were characterized for serum stability, binding affinity on PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice, and gamma camera imaging at 1, 6, and 24 h after injection.  Results:   Serum stability was quite variable among the different compounds with half-lives ranging from 16 to 400 min at 37 °C. All compounds tested showed K d values in the nanomolar range with the exception of BN3 that showed no binding. Biodistribution and imaging studies carried out for compounds BN1, BN4, BN7, and BN8 showed targeting of the GRP-R-positive tumors and the pancreas. The BN8 compound (DOTA-PEG-DPhe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2) showed high affinity, the longest serum stability, and the highest target-to-background ratios in biodistribution and imaging experiments among the compounds tested.

The aim of the study was to observe the influence of hypoxia on the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), using an original model of multicellular spheroids obtained from castration-resistant prostate tumor cells.  Material:   Two human castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines have been used to generate multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS). The conditions and duration of incubation modulated the final size of the MTS and the intrinsic hypoxia gradient. The expression of AR was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and secretion of PSA measured in the culture medium.  Results:   The IHC expression of AR was characterized by a decreasing gradient from the periphery to the center of MTS (less intense in central hypoxic zone), corresponding to a nuclear translocation of activated AR. This result was proportionally correlated with the duration of hypoxic incubation period. Hypoxia caused significant increase in AR expression at 6h of oxygen deprivation. This activation of AR was correlated with transcriptional activity increase of target genes, including increased secretion of PSA.  Conclusion:   This demonstration of activation, increased expression and increased transcriptional activity of AR by hypoxia is the first to have been made with an original model of hypoxia, closer to reality than previous models, i.e. close to tissue hypoxia observed in primary prostate cancer.

Methods:   We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional survey of 260 men (132 black, 128 white) aged ≤75 years, with newly diagnosed LPC. Our primary outcome was treatment choice (either surgery, radiation, or watchful waiting/active surveillance (WW/AS)), and our primary predictors were race and tumor risk level.  Results:   Overall, treatment choice did not differ by race. As cancer risk increased, both black and white patients were more likely to undergo surgery and less likely to receive radiation. However, the pattern of WW/AS was different between white and black men. White men were less likely to select WW/AS as cancer risk increased, while risk level was unrelated to black men undergoing WW/AS. Urologist's recommendation had the greatest impact on men's treatment choice, followed by tumor risk level, age, and personal preferences.

In the present study, NDRG1 overexpression and silencing models of HT29 colon cancer and DU145 prostate cancer cells were used to examine the activation of FAK/paxillin signaling and the formation of focal adhesions. The expression of NDRG1 resulted in a marked and significant decrease in the activating phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, whereas silencing of NDRG1 resulted in an opposite effect. The expression of NDRG1 also inhibited the formation of focal adhesions as well as cell migration and cell-collagen adhesion.

In recent years, various methods of uEV enrichment using low volumes of urine and unsophisticated equipment have been developed, with variable success. We compared the results of the differential ultracentrifugation procedure with 4 of these methods. The methods tested were a lectin-based purification, Exoquick (System Biosciences), Total Exosome Isolation from Invitrogen and an in-house modified procedure employing the Exosomal RNA Kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. The analysis of selected gene transcripts and protein markers of extracellular vesicles (EVs) revealed that each method isolates a different mixture of uEV protein markers. In our conditions, the extraction with Norgen's reagent achieved the best performance in terms of gene transcript and protein detection and reproducibility. By using this method, we were able to detect alterations of EVs protein markers in urine samples from prostate cancer adenoma patients. Taken together, our results show that the isolation of uEVs is feasible from small volumes of urine and avoiding ultracentrifugation, making easier the analysis in a clinical facility.

More importantly, we identified that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), a steroid receptor superfamily member, transcriptionally regulates the expression of MPC1. We further demonstrate that COUP-TFII, which is upregulated in the prostate cancer patient, regulates MPC1 and glycolysis to promote tumor growth and metastasis.

Materials and methods:   ALDH1A1 expression was examined in a well-defined series of prostate tissues, including 105 (68%) samples of PCa, 21 (13%) samples of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and 31 (19%) samples of benign prostate hyperplasia, which were embedded in tissue microarray blocks. The correlation of ALDH1A1 expression with clinicopathologic parameters was also assessed.  Results:   There was a significant difference between the expression level of ALDH1A1 in PCa compared with the high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign prostate hyperplasia samples (P<0.001). PCa cells expressing ALDH1A1 were more often seen in samples with advanced Gleason score (P=0.05) and high serum prostate specific antigen level (P=0.02). In addition, a positive correlation was found between ALDH1A1 expression and primary tumor stage and regional lymph node involvement (P=0.04 and 0.03, respectively).

It was reported that androgens were able to induce FASN expression in PCa, and addition of the anti-androgen Casodex might suppress the androgen-induced FASN expression. However, here we found androgen-deprivation-therapy (ADT) with anti-androgens Bicalutamide (Casodex) or Enzalutamide (MDV3100) had little effect to suppress FASN expression and FASN-mediated cell growth and invasion during the castration resistant stage when the androgen concentration is 1 nM DHT (dihydrotestosterone). In contrast, the newly developed androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9® suppressed FASN expression and FASN-mediated cell growth and invasion in various PCa cell lines at 1 nM DHT. Mechanism dissection found ASC-J9® could suppress significantly the FASN expression and FASN-mediated PCa progression via the AR-dependent pathway involving AR→SREBP-1→FASN signaling in AR-positive C4-2 and LNCaP cells and via the AR-independent pathway involving the modulation of PI3K/AKT→SREBP-1→FASN signaling in AR-negative PC-3 and DU145 cells. Together, these results suggest that FASN is one of the important mechanism why the current ADT eventually fails.

An Elekta Synergy linear accelerator with an Agility collimator capable of delivering FFF beams and a standard iViewGT amorphous silicon (aSi) EPID panel (RID 1640 AL5P) at a fixed SSD of 160 cm were used. Dose rates for FFF beams are up to four times higher than for conventional flattened beams, meaning images taken at maximum FFF dose rate can saturate the EPID. A dose rate of 800 MU/min was found not to saturate the EPID for open fields. This dose rate was subsequently used to characterize the EPID for FFF portal dosimetry. A range of open and phantom fields were measured with both an ion chamber and the EPID, to allow comparison between the two. The measured data were then used to create a model within The Nederlands Kanker Instituut's (NKI's) portal dosimetry software. The model was verified using simple square fields with a range of field sizes and phantom thicknesses. These were compared to calculations performed with the Monaco treatment planning system (TPS) and isocentric ion chamber measurements. It was found that the results for the FFF verification were similar to those for flattened beams with testing on square fields, indicating a difference in dose between the TPS and portal dosimetry of approximately 1%. Two FFF IMRT plans (prostate and lung SABR) were delivered to a homogeneous phantom and showed an overall dose difference at isocenter of ~0.5% and good agreement between the TPS and PD dose distributions.

Ectopic expression of MDA-5 has been shown to induce cancer cell death, but the mechanism of action by which MDA-5 exerts these cytotoxic effects is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of MDA-5 via replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad.Mda-5) initiates multiple signaling cascades, culminating in cytotoxicity and type I IFN production in mouse and human prostate cancer cells. This intrinsic dual activity of MDA-5 required the adaptor protein IFNβ promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, MAVS) and could be functionally uncoupled. MDA-5 lacking N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARD) engaged an intracellular death program in cancer cells but was unable to efficiently stimulate the expression of IFNβ. In contrast to cancer cells susceptible to MDA-5-mediated cytotoxicity, normal cells were highly resistant and instead developed a robust type I IFN response. Strikingly, intratumoral delivery of Ad.Mda-5 led to regression of preestablished prostate cancers and development of long-lasting antitumor immune memory, which was primarily attributed to the activation of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes and/or natural killer cells. Using the CARD-truncated MDA-5 mutant, silencing of IPS-1, and antibody blockade of the IFNα/β receptor, we further demonstrate that type I IFN signaling was crucial for in situ MDA-5-induced protective antitumor immunity. Therefore, deliberately targeting the evolutionarily conserved MDA-5-IPS-1 antiviral pathway in tumors can provoke parallel tumoricidal and immunostimulatory effects that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses for the therapeutic treatment of cancer.

However, acquired paclitaxel-resistance almost always occurs after initial responses, and the mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown. The goal of the present study was to identify differentially expressed protein(s) associated with paclitaxel-resistance and further explore the potential mechanisms involved in drug resistance. By comparing the nuclear matrix protein (NMP) patterns of DU145-TxR cells, the previously established stable paclitaxel-resistant PCa cells, with that of the parental DU145 cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we found that cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is downregulated in DU145-TxR cells. The downregulation of CK18 in DU145-TxR cells at mRNA, NMP and total cellular protein levels was validated by real-time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, indicating that the downregulation of CK18 was a global effect in DU145-TxR cells due to paclitaxel-resistance. Furthermore, in vivo assay of xenograft transplantation confirmed the higher tumorigenicity of DU145-TxR cells, suggesting that these paclitaxel-resistant PCa cells possessed potent cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties and eventually developed paclitaxel-resistance. Moreover, we determined by immunohistochemistry that CK18 expression in PCa tissues was inversely correlated with tumor grade in a statistically significant fashion, indicating a potential association of the downregulation of CK18 with tumor aggressiveness.

Materials and methods:   We included 2,007 patients treated with RARP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at a single institution between 2008 and 2012. D'Amico low risk patients underwent an obturator and hypogastric PLND, while extended PLND was reserved for intermediate/high risk patients. Logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between LNI and all available predictors. Independent predictors of LNI were used to develop a novel nomogram. Discrimination, calibration and decision-curve analysis were used to analyze the performance of our novel nomogram, and compare it to open radical prostatectomy (ORP)-based models, namely the Godoy nomogram.  Results:   Overall, 5.3% of our patients harbored LNI. Median number of lymph nodes removed was 6.0 (interquartile range: 4-11). The most parsimonious multivariable model to predict LNI consisted of the following independent predictors: PSA value, clinical stage, and primary and secondary Gleason scores (all p ≤ 0.02). The discrimination of our novel model was 86.2%, and its calibration was virtually optimal. Using a 2% nomogram cut off, 58% of patients would be spared PLND, while missing only 9.4% of individuals with LNI. The novel nomogram compared favorably to the Godoy nomogram, when discrimination, calibration and net-benefit were used as benchmarks.  Conclusions:   Approximately 5% of contemporary North American patients harbor LNI at RARP.

The present study found that E2F1 overexpression in PCa tissues was significantly associated with high Gleason score (P=0.01) and advanced pathological stage (P=0.02). In addition, PCa patients with high E2F1 expression more frequently had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (P=0.047) than those with low E2F1 expression.

Moreover, we identified CD147 as a novel interaction partner for E2F1 through bio-informatic binding site prediction, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP-PCR) and western blot analysis.

Objectives:   To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and preliminary efficacy of Serenoa repens commonly known as saw palmetto (SP) for management of LUTS during RT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   The dose finding phase used the time-to-event continual reassessment method to evaluate safety of three doses (320, 640, and 960 mg) of SP. Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed for 22 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events for nausea, gastritis, and anorexia. The exploratory randomized controlled trial phase assessed preliminary efficacy of the MTD against placebo. The primary outcome of LUTS was measured over 22 weeks using the International Prostate Symptom Score. Additional longitudinal assessments included quality of life measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate.  Results:   The dose finding phase was completed by 27 men who reported no dose-limiting toxicities and with 20 participants at the MTD of 960 mg daily. The exploratory randomized controlled trial phase included 21 men, and no statistically significant differences in the International Prostate Symptom Score were observed. The prostate-specific concerns score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate improved in the SP group (P = 0.03). Of 11 men in the placebo group, two received physician-prescribed medications to manage LUTS compared with none of the 10 men in the SP group.  Conclusion:   SP at 960 mg may be a safe herbal supplement, but its efficacy in managing LUTS during RT needs further investigation.""","""['Gwen K Wyatt', 'Alla Sikorskii', 'Abolfazl Safikhani', 'Kevin T McVary', 'James Herman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pain Symptom Manage""","""['Efficacy and safety of solifenacin plus tamsulosin OCAS in men with voiding and storage lower urinary tract symptoms: results from a phase 2, dose-finding study (SATURN).', 'Saw palmetto fruit extract improves LUTS in type ⅢA prostatitis patients.', 'Effect of increasing doses of saw palmetto extract on lower urinary tract symptoms: a randomized trial.', 'Tadalafil - a therapeutic option in the management of BPH-LUTS.', 'Saw palmetto for the treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Trends in patient-reported outcome use in early phase dose-finding oncology trials - an analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the mir-17-92 cluster-mediated pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic effects has not been clearly elucidated in prostate cancer. In the present study, the role of the mir-17-92 cluster in diverse aspects of prostate cancer cells has been thoroughly investigated. Forced introduction of the mir-17-92 cluster into the androgen-independent DU145 prostate cancer cells evidently promoted cell growth due to disruption of the balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Overexpression of the mir-17-92 cluster significantly improved the migration and invasion of the DU145 cells, attributed to the induction of integrin β-1. Notably, the mir-17-92 cluster conveyed chemo-resistance to cisplatin. We demonstrated that the mir-17-92 cluster suppressed the expression of inhibitor of the AKT signaling pathway and activated the AKT pathway subsequently, which played a central role in regulating cellular proliferation, apoptosis and chemo-resistance. Continuously activated ERK1/2 signaling also contributed importantly to these processes. The present study provides key evidence for crucial oncogenic role of the miR-17-92 cluster in prostate cancer cells. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether miR-17-92 cluster can be targeted for future treatment of human prostate cancer.""","""['Peng Zhou', 'Liang Ma', 'Jun Zhou', 'Min Jiang', 'Enyu Rao', 'Yong Zhao', 'Feng Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The other face of miR-17-92a cluster, exhibiting tumor suppressor effects in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-218 inhibits tumor growth and increases chemosensitivity to CDDP treatment by targeting BCAT1 in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-suppressive microRNA-223 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting ITGA3/ITGB1 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Effects of miR-200c on the migration and invasion abilities of human prostate cancer Du145 cells and the corresponding mechanism.', 'MiR-203 over-expression promotes prostate cancer cell apoptosis and reduces ADM resistance.', 'Extracellular circulating miRNAs as potential non-invasive biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Overexpression of miR-20a-5p in Tumor Epithelium Is an Independent Negative Prognostic Indicator in Prostate Cancer-A Multi-Institutional Study.', 'The Role of MiRNA in Cancer: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment.']"""

This distinctive characteristic places added strain on the connected pathways, which are forced to increase metabolite production to maintain pools. The methionine salvage pathway recycles the one-carbon unit lost to polyamine biosynthesis back to the methionine cycle, allowing for replenishment of SAM pools providing a mechanism to help mitigate metabolic stress associated with high flux through these pathways. The rate-limiting enzyme involved in this process is methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which, although commonly deleted in many cancers, is protected in prostate cancer. We report near universal retention of MTAP expression in a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines as well as patient samples. Upon metabolic perturbation, prostate cancer cell lines upregulate MTAP and this correlates with recovery of SAM levels. Furthermore, in a mouse model of prostate cancer we find that both normal prostate and diseased prostate maintain higher SAM levels than other tissues, even under increased metabolic stress. Finally, we show that knockdown of MTAP, both genetically and pharmacologically, blocks androgen sensitive prostate cancer growth in vivo. Our findings strongly suggest that the methionine salvage pathway is a major player in homeostatic regulation of metabolite pools in prostate cancer due to their high level of flux through the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, this pathway, and specifically the MTAP enzyme, is an attractive therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Gaia Bistulfi', 'Hayley C Affronti', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Ellen Karasik', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Carl Morrison', 'James Mohler', 'James G Phillips', 'Dominic J Smiraglia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Pharmacological polyamine catabolism upregulation with methionine salvage pathway inhibition as an effective prostate cancer therapy.', 'Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase regulates ornithine decarboxylase by production of downstream metabolites.', 'Transition state analogue of MTAP extends lifespan of APCMin/+ mice.', 'Targeting tumors that lack methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) activity: current strategies.', 'Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase deficiency in tumors: A compelling therapeutic target.', 'Activity of pemetrexed in pre-clinical chordoma models and humans.', 'MTAP loss: a possible therapeutic approach for glioblastoma.', 'Coronary Heart Disease in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Genetic Factors and Their Mechanisms, Gene-Gene, and Gene-Environment Interactions in the Asian Populations.', 'Polyamine Homeostasis in Development and Disease.', 'Polyamine pathway activity promotes cysteine essentiality in cancer cells.']"""

Recent evidence has linked urate to cancers, but little is known about urate effects in prostate cancer. Activins are inflammatory cytokines and negative growth regulators in the prostate. A hallmark of prostate cancer progression is activin insensitivity; however, mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We propose that elevated SUA is associated with prostate cancer counteracting the growth inhibitory effects of activins. The expression of activins A and B, urate transporter GLUT9 and tissue urate levels were examined in human prostate disease. Intracellular and secreted urate and GLUT9 expression were assessed in human prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the effects of urate and probenecid, a known urate transport inhibitor, were determined in combination with activin A. Activin A expression was increased in low-grade prostate cancer, whereas activin B expression was reduced in high-grade prostate cancer. Intracellular urate levels decreased in all prostate pathologies, while GLUT9 expression decreased in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis and high-grade prostate cancer. Activin responsive LNCaP cells had higher intracellular and lower secreted urate levels than activin-insensitive PC3 cells. GLUT9 expression in prostate cancer cells was progressively lower than in prostate epithelial cells. Elevated extracellular urate was growth promoting in vitro, which was abolished by the gout medication probenecid, and it antagonized the growth inhibitory effects of activins. This study shows for the first time that a change in plasma or intracellular urate levels, possibly involving GLUT9 and a urate efflux transporter, has an impact on prostate cancer cell growth, and that lowering SUA levels in prostate cancer is likely to be therapeutically beneficial.""","""['Febbie Sangkop', 'Geeta Singh', 'Ely Rodrigues', 'Elspeth Gold', 'Andrew Bahn']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Urate transport capacity of glucose transporter 9 and urate transporter 1 in cartilage chondrocytes.', 'Characterizations of the Urate Transporter, GLUT9, and Its Potent Inhibitors by Patch-Clamp Technique.', 'Activin inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth: selective actions on androgen-responsive LNCaP cells.', 'Activins and activin antagonists in the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Uric acid transport and disease.', 'Investigating the Anti-inflammatory Effect of Allopurinol on the Prevention of Prostate Cancer.', 'Activin B and Activin C Have Opposing Effects on Prostate Cancer Progression and Cell Growth.', 'Higher Levels of Serum Uric Acid Have a Significant Association with Lower Incidence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Healthy Korean Men.', 'Vibrational spectroscopy of liquid biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases 2 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer progression by suppressing cell cycle and inducing cell apoptosis.']"""

Incidence data are from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and mortality data are from the National Center for Health Statistics. Approximately 189,910 new cases of cancer and 69,410 cancer deaths will occur among blacks in 2016. Although blacks continue to have higher cancer death rates than whites, the disparity has narrowed for all cancers combined in men and women and for lung and prostate cancers in men. In contrast, the racial gap in death rates has widened for breast cancer in women and remained level for colorectal cancer in men. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since the early 1990s translates to the avoidance of more than 300,000 deaths among blacks. In men, incidence rates from 2003 to 2012 decreased for all cancers combined (by 2.0% per year) as well as for the top 3 cancer sites (prostate, lung, and colorectal). In women, overall rates during the corresponding time period remained unchanged, reflecting increasing trends in breast cancer combined with decreasing trends in lung and colorectal cancer rates. Five-year relative survival is lower for blacks than whites for most cancers at each stage of diagnosis. The extent to which these disparities reflect unequal access to health care versus other factors remains an active area of research. Progress in reducing cancer death rates could be accelerated by ensuring equitable access to prevention, early detection, and high-quality treatment.

Methods:   Three readers independently evaluated 100 patients (67 with proven PCa) who underwent MP-MRI and RSI within 6 months of systematic biopsy (N = 67; 23 with targeting performed) or prostatectomy (N = 33). Imaging was performed at 3 Tesla using a phased-array coil. Readers used a five-point scale estimating the likelihood of PCa present in each prostate sextant. Evaluation was performed in two separate sessions, first using conventional MP-MRI alone then immediately with MP-MRI and RSI in the same session. Four weeks later, another scoring session used RSI and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) without conventional diffusion-weighted or dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Reader interpretations were then compared to prostatectomy data or biopsy results. Receiver operating characteristic curves were performed, with area under the curve (AUC) used to compare across groups.  Results:   MP-MRI with RSI achieved higher AUCs compared to MP-MRI alone for identifying high-grade (Gleason score greater than or equal to 4 + 3=7) PCa (0.78 vs. 0.70 at the sextant level; P < 0.001 and 0.85 vs. 0.79 at the hemigland level; P = 0.04). RSI and T2WI alone achieved AUCs similar to MP-MRI for high-grade PCa (0.71 vs. 0.70 at the sextant level). With hemigland analysis, high-grade disease results were similar when comparing RSI + T2WI with MP-MRI, although with greater AUCs compared to the sextant analysis (0.80 vs. 0.79).

Notably, ovarian cancer cells responsive to the PI3K/PARP combination displayed decreased BRCA1/2 expression upon drug treatment. Furthermore, the effect of the drug combination was corroborated in an intraperitoneal dissemination xenograft mouse model in which SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells responded with significantly decreased BRCA1 expression, suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling and reduced tumor burden.

However, serum B2M was not examined prospectively as a marker for cancer risk. We hypothesized that in a population without a prior cancer diagnosis, serum B2M is associated with risk of cancer (n = 2,436), including colorectal (n = 255), lung (n = 298), breast (n = 424), and prostate (n = 524) cancers, and hematological (n = 176) malignancies.  Methods:   The analytical cohort (n = 12,300) was followed for incident cancers from 1990 through 2006. B2M (range, 0.9-57.8 mg/L) was measured in stored serum collected in 1990-1992. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for cancer incidence and mortality in relation to quartiles of B2M.  Results:   Adjusting for age, sex, race, center, education, body mass index, smoking, aspirin, and hormone therapy (in women) and comparing highest to lowest B2M quartiles, HRs were 1.25 (1.06-1.47; Ptrend = 0.002) for total cancer risk and 2.21 (1.32-3.70; Ptrend=0.001) for colorectal cancer risk, with similar HRs for colon and rectal cancers. These associations remained after adjustment for an inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein, and after excluding the first three years of follow-up. Significant associations were also observed for mortality from total, lung, and hematological cancers.  Conclusions:   These findings provide the first evidence that higher serum B2M is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk.

The aims of the study were to examine 1) changes in the PP of opioids from 2005 to 2009 among outpatients with cancer who were in their last year of life and 2) associations between the PP of opioids and medical and sociodemographic factors.  Design:   Retrospective, registry-based, national study.  Patients:   This study used data on all patients with cancer who died 2005-2009, combining the following three complete nationwide registries; prescription data from the Norwegian Prescription Database, data on cancer diseases from the Cancer Registry of Norway, and sociodemographic data from Statistics Norway.  Results:   The study population consisted of 44,579 adults (mean age 72 years at death, 54 percent males). The opioid PP increased from 74 to 82 percent during the study period. Oxycodone had the highest PP, and increased from 39.8 to 48.5 percent during the period, whereas the PP of morphine declined from 29.0 to 27.3 percent. The PP for fentanyl remained stable at 17 percent. The PP of opioids increased toward death with higher PP during the last 3 months of life compared to previous 3-month periods. Older patients (>60) were less likely to receive opioids, while prostate or pancreatic cancer increased the odds for opioid prescriptions (p < 0.001, Odds ratio [OR] 2.60 and OR 1.98, respectively).

Evidence acquisition:   A perspective of the evolving landscape in male reproductive medicine.  Evidence synthesis:   Remarkable discoveries in reproductive biology have greatly advanced the treatment of erectile dysfunction, androgen deficiency, infertility, hormone sensitive cancers, and prostate diseases. Although the off-label use of testosterone in middle-aged and older men has grown, the management of androgen deficiency syndromes remains suboptimal. There is a pressing need for wider adoption of accurate testosterone assays and harmonized reference ranges and large randomized trials of testosterone's efficacy and cardiovascular and prostate safety. The transformation in idealized body image towards greater muscularity has contributed to increasing prevalence of body image disorders and the use of muscle building drugs in men. Therapeutic options for fertility regulation in men remain limited, the pathophysiologic basis of infertility in a vast majority of infertile men remains unknown, and assisted reproductive technologies remain inaccessible to many infertile men. Much of the dogma on testosterone's binding to its binding proteins remains inaccurate, and the role of free and albumin-bound testosterone poorly understood. The reproductive health of cancer survivors and the availability of wider contraceptive choices for men are other areas of unmet need. Suboptimal care of transgender persons has framed transgender medicine as an important healthcare disparities issue.

Methods and materials:   Twenty patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer randomized to receive passive-scattering PT (n=10) and IMRT (n=10) were selected. For both modalities, clinical treatment plans included 50.4 Gy(RBE) to prostate and proximal seminal vesicles, and prostate-only boost to 79.2 Gy(RBE) in 1.8 Gy(RBE) per fraction. Implanted fiducials were used for prostate localization and endorectal balloons were used for immobilization. Patients in PT and IMRT arms received weekly computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) scans, respectively. The planned dose was recalculated on each weekly image, scaled, and mapped onto the planning CT using deformable registration. The resulting accumulated dose distribution over the entire treatment course was compared with the planned dose using dose-volume histogram (DVH) and γ analysis.  Results:   The target conformity index remained acceptable after accumulation. The largest decrease in the average prostate D98 was 2.2 and 0.7 Gy for PT and IMRT, respectively.

Although robot-assisted needle placement is expected to be more accurate than manual template-guided insertion, needle positioning errors may occur and are likely to modify the pre-planned dose distribution.In this paper, we propose a dose plan adaptation strategy for HDR prostate brachytherapy with feedback on the needle position: a dose plan is made at the beginning of the interventional procedure and updated after each needle insertion in order to compensate for possible needle positioning errors. The introduced procedure can be used with the single needle MR-compatible robot developed at the UMCU. The proposed feedback strategy was tested by simulating complete HDR procedures with and without feedback on eight patients with different numbers of needle insertions (varying from 4 to 12). In of the cases tested, the number of clinically acceptable plans obtained at the end of the procedure was larger with feedback compared to the situation without feedback. Furthermore, the computation time of the feedback between each insertion was below 100 s which makes it eligible for intra-operative use.""","""['M Borot de Battisti', 'B Denis de Senneville', 'M Maenhout', 'G Hautvast', 'D Binnekamp', 'J J W Lagendijk', 'M van Vulpen', 'M A Moerland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A novel adaptive needle insertion sequencing for robotic, single needle MR-guided high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'An automated optimization tool for high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy with divergent needle pattern.', 'Advantage of robotic needle placement on a prostate model in HDR brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Image-Guided Gynecologic Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer.', 'Concepts and Trends n Autonomy for Robot-Assisted Surgery.', 'Axially rigid steerable needle with compliant active tip control.']"""

The development of therapeutic approaches based on targeting rare CSCs has been limited partially due to the lack of appropriate experimental models and measurement approaches. The current study presents new tools and methodologies based on a hydrogel microstructure array (HMA) for identification and multiplex analyses of CSCs. Low-melt agarose integrated with type I collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), was used to form a solid hydrogel array with natural non-adhesive characteristics and high optical quality. The array contained thousands of individual pyramidal shaped, nanoliter-volume micro-chambers (MCs), allowing concomitant generation and measurement of large populations of free-floating CSC spheroids from single cells, each in an individual micro-chamber (MC). The optical live cell platform, based on an imaging plate patterned with HMA, was validated using CSC-enriched prostate and colon cancer cell lines. The HMA methodology and quantitative image analysis at single-element resolution clearly demonstrates several levels of tumor cell heterogeneity, including morphological and phenotypic variability, differences in proliferation capacity and in drug response. Moreover, the system facilitates real-time examination of single stem cell (SC) fate, as well as drug-induced alteration in expression of stemness markers. The technology may be applicable in personalized cancer treatment, including multiplex ex vivo analysis of heterogeneous patient-derived tumor specimens, precise detection and characterization of potentially dangerous cell phenotypes, and for representative evaluation of drug sensitivity of CSCs and other types of tumor cells.""","""['E Afrimzon', 'G Botchkina', 'N Zurgil', 'Y Shafran', 'M Sobolev', 'S Moshkov', 'O Ravid-Hermesh', 'I Ojima', 'M Deutsch']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['Phenotypic subpopulations of metastatic colon cancer stem cells: genomic analysis.', 'Cancer stem cells in drug resistant lung cancer: Targeting cell surface markers and signaling pathways.', 'Enrichment of cancer stem cell-like cells by culture in alginate gel beads.', 'Concise Review: Emerging Role of CD44 in Cancer Stem Cells: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Evolving Strategies for Therapeutically Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Spatial-temporal correlations in the speckle pattern for the characterization of cellular motion within a 3D object.', 'Gold-nanoparticle-embedded hydrogel droplets with enhanced fluorescence for imaging and quantification of proteins in cells.', 'Proteinaceous Hydrogels for Bioengineering Advanced 3D Tumor Models.', 'Fluid shear stress stimulates breast cancer cells to display invasive and chemoresistant phenotypes while upregulating PLAU in a 3D bioreactor.', 'Integrated cancer tissue engineering models for precision medicine.']"""

We have previously demonstrated that sub-effective concentrations of an AR antagonist, bicalutamide, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat, act synergistically when combined to cause death of AR-dependent prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study, expression profiling of human prostate cancer cells treated with bicalutamide or vorinostat, alone or in combination, was employed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this synergistic action. Cell viability assays and quantitative real time PCR were used to validate identified candidate genes.  Results:   A substantial proportion of the genes modulated by the combination of bicalutamide and vorinostat were androgen regulated. Independent pathway analysis identified further pathways and genes, most notably NFKBIA (encoding IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB and p53 signaling), as targets of this combinatorial treatment. Depletion of IκBα by siRNA knockdown enhanced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, while ectopic overexpression of IκBα markedly suppressed cell death induced by the combination of bicalutamide and vorinostat.

To date, symptom cluster studies have used patient-reported data, which are not always available in clinical trials. In this study, we proposed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to identify adverse event clusters because the CTCAE data are collected as standard practice and can therefore be used when patient-reported outcomes are unavailable.  Methods:   The CTCAE data from a randomized clinical trial conducted by SWOG that compared docetaxel plus estramustine versus mitoxantrone plus predinsone in patients with advanced prostate cancer were used to identify severe adverse event clusters. A variable based hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using the CTCAE for the 323 patients who experienced at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event.  Results:   A total of 109 adverse event types were captured using the CTCAE. Four clusters had moderate associations: nausea, vomiting, and anorexia (n = 35, r = 0.45); joint/bone(myalgia, arthralgia, and arthritis) and muscle weakness (n = 26, r = 0.29); anemia and transfusion (n = 20, r = 0.38); and neutrophils/granulocytes, febrile neutropenia, and leukocytes/lymphopenia (n = 114, r = 0.29). Two clusters had weak associations: fatigue/malaise/lethargy and dehydration (n = 66, r = 0.12); and constipation, infection without neutropenia, and abdominal pain/cramping (n = 35, r = 0.13).  Conclusion:   Several severe adverse event clusters were identified in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

In the present study, we investigated whether BITC inhibits the development of prostate cancer in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Five-week old, male TRAMP mice and their nontransgenic littermates were gavage-fed with 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg of BITC every day for 19 weeks. The weight of the genitourinary tract increased markedly in TRAMP mice and this increase was suppressed significantly by BITC feeding. H and E staining of the dorsolateral lobes of the prostate demonstrated that well-differentiated carcinoma (WDC) was a predominant feature in the TRAMP mice. The number of lobes with WDC was reduced by BITC feeding while that of lobes with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was increased. BITC feeding reduced the number of cells expressing Ki67 (a proliferation marker), cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 in the prostatic tissue. In vitro cell culture results revealed that BITC decreased DNA synthesis, as well as CDK2 and CDK4 activity in TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate cancer cells.

Here, we investigate the biomarker potential of the SLC18A2 (VMAT2) gene for PC at three molecular levels. Thus, SLC18A2 promoter methylation was analyzed in 767 malignant and 78 benign radical prostatectomy (RP) samples using methylation-specific qPCR and Illumina 450K methylation microarray data. SLC18A2 transcript levels were assessed in 412 malignant and 45 benign RP samples using RNAseq data. SLC18A2 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 502 malignant and 305 benign RP samples. Cancer-specificity of molecular changes was tested using Mann-Whitney U tests and/or receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Log rank, uni- and multivariate Cox regression tests were used for survival analyses. We found that SLC18A2 promoter hypermethylation was highly cancer-specific (area under the curve (AUC): 0.923-0.976) and associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in univariate analyses. SLC18A2 transcript levels were reduced in PC and had independent prognostic value for BCR after RP (multivariate HR 0.13, P < 0.05). Likewise, SLC18A2 protein was down-regulated in PC (AUC 0.898) and had independent prognostic value for BCR (multivariate HR 0.51, P < 0.05). Reduced SLC18A2 protein expression was also associated with poor overall survival in univariate analysis (HR 0.29, P < 0.05). Our results highlight SLC18A2 as a new promising methylation marker candidate for PC diagnosis. Furthermore, SLC18A2 expression (RNA and protein) showed promising prognostic potential beyond routine clinicopathological variables. Thus, novel SLC18A2-based molecular tests could have useful future applications for PC detection and identification of high-risk patients.""","""['Christa Haldrup', 'Anne-Sofie Lynnerup', 'Tine Maj Storebjerg', 'Søren Vang', 'Peter Wild', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Christian Arsov', 'Wolfgang A Schulz', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Lars Egevad', 'Michael Borre', 'Torben Falck Ørntoft', 'Søren Høyer', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Comprehensive Evaluation of TFF3 Promoter Hypomethylation and Molecular Biomarker Potential for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'Epigenetic silencing of MEIS2 in prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Genetic and epigenetic SLC18A2 silencing in prostate cancer is an independent adverse predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'Mir-421 and mir-550a-1 are potential prognostic markers in esophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Dopamine-related oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons differentiated from deciduous teeth-derived stem cells of children with Down syndrome.', 'Five-gene signature associating with Gleason score serve as novel biomarkers for identifying early recurring events and contributing to early diagnosis for Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Grading Evolution and Contemporary Prognostic Biomarkers of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'FRMD6 has tumor suppressor functions in prostate cancer.']"""

Although most cases are initially diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive, more than 80% of patients will develop recurrent or metastatic tumors. No effective therapy exists currently for late-stage metastatic tumors. By intravesical application, local administration of oncolytic Herpes Simplex virus (oHSV-1) can provide a promising new therapy for this disease. However, its inherent neurotoxicity has been a perceived limitation for such application. In this study, we present a novel microRNA-regulatory approach to reduce HSV-1-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing viral replication in neurons while maintaining oncolytic selectivity toward urothelial tumors. Specifically, we designed a recombinant virus that utilizes differentially expressed endogenous microR143 (non-cancerous, ubiquitous) and microR124 (neural-specific) to regulate expression of ICP-4, a gene essential for HSV-1 replication. We found that expression of ICP-4 must be controlled by a combination of both miR143 and miR124 to achieve the most effective attenuation in HSV-1-induced toxicity while retaining maximal oncolytic capacity. These results suggest that interaction between miR143 and miR124 may be required to successfully regulate HSV-1 replication. Our resent study is the first proof-in-principle that miRNA combination can be exploited to fine-tune the replication of HSV-1 to treat human cancers.""","""['K-X Zhang', 'Y Matsui', 'C Lee', 'O Osamu', 'L Skinner', 'J Wang', 'A So', 'P S Rennie', 'W W Jia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['MicroRNA regulation of oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 for selective killing of prostate cancer cells.', 'Oncolytic virus therapy using genetically engineered herpes simplex viruses.', ""Enhanced cytotoxicity with a novel system combining the paclitaxel-2'-ethylcarbonate prodrug and an HSV amplicon with an attenuated replication-competent virus, HF10 as a helper virus."", 'Imaging immediate-early and strict-late promoter activity during oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 infection and replication in tumors.', 'Non-engineered, naturally oncolytic herpes simplex virus HSV1 HF-10: applications for cancer gene therapy.', 'Targeting carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing tumors using a novel transcriptional and translational dual-regulated oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1.', 'Oncolytic Viruses for the Treatment of Bladder Cancer: Advances, Challenges, and Prospects.', 'MicroRNAs: Key Players in Bladder Cancer.', 'Trial Watch: Oncolytic viro-immunotherapy of hematologic and solid tumors.']"""

In this study, we assessed the association of PTEN loss with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and increased chemosensitivity.  Materials and methods:   The PTEN knockdown models were created using MISSION shRNA lentiviral transduction particles in cell lines derived from normal ovarian surface epithelium and a mixed endometrioid/clear-cell carcinoma. Sensitivity to common therapeutics was assessed using sulforhodamine B assay. Twenty-eight unselected primary epithelial ovarian cancer cultures derived from ascitic fluid collected at the time of surgery and matched genomic DNA were assessed for PTEN mutations using polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing and for mRNA expression using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HR was determined using γH2AX/RAD51 assay. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were analyzed using cBioPortal.  Results:   In the carcinoma cell line, the PTEN knockdown enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin, rucaparib, doxorubicin, camptothecin, paclitaxel, and irradiation. In the primary ovarian cancer cultures, 2 point mutations were found (1105T>TG, 25L>L in 6 cultures and 1508G>GA, 159R>R in 4 cultures). The PTEN mRNA expression varied over 40-fold between the cultures, but did not correlate with HR status or in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin or rucaparib. The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed a rate of 8% alteration in PTEN and a trend toward improved survival in PTEN-mutated cases.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that although PTEN mutations in ovarian cancer are rare, PTEN inhibition results in therapeutic sensitization. Therefore, PTEN may be an important therapeutic target, in at least some cancers.""","""['Aiste McCormick', 'Eleanor Earp', 'Charlotte Leeson', 'Michelle Dixon', ""Rachel O'Donnell"", 'Angelika Kaufmann', 'Richard J Edmondson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Gynecol Cancer""","""['Inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway sensitizes endometrial cancer cell lines to PARP inhibitors.', 'PTEN deficiency sensitizes endometrioid endometrial cancer to compound PARP-PI3K inhibition but not PARP inhibition as monotherapy.', 'Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) Increases chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by increasing production of reactive oxygen species in human ovarian cancer cells (HO8910).', 'Gene expression profiling of human ovarian epithelial tumors by digo nucleotide microarray.', 'Molecular pathogenesis of endometrial and ovarian cancer.', 'Overlapping gene dependencies for PARP inhibitors and carboplatin response identified by functional CRISPR-Cas9 screening in ovarian cancer.', 'Pilot investigation of the mutation profile of PIK3CA/PTEN genes (PI3K pathway) in grade 3 endometrial cancer.', 'Candidate synthetic lethality partners to PARP inhibitors in the treatment of ovarian clear cell cancer.']"""

Among men with localized prostate cancer, especially with low- or intermediate-risk disease, vitamin D may serve as an important biomarker of disease aggression. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between adverse pathology at the time of radical prostatectomy and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was carried out from 2009 to 2014, nested within a large epidemiologic study of 1,760 healthy controls and men undergoing prostate cancer screening. In total, 190 men underwent radical prostatectomy in the cohort. Adverse pathology was defined as the presence of primary Gleason 4 or any Gleason 5 disease, or extraprostatic extension. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between 25-OH D and adverse pathology at the time of prostatectomy.  Results:   Eighty-seven men (45.8%) in this cohort demonstrated adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy. The median age in the cohort was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 59.0 to 67.0). On univariate analysis, men with adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy demonstrated lower median serum 25-OH D (22.7 v 27.0 ng/mL, P = .007) compared with their counterparts. On multivariate analysis, controlling for age, serum prostate specific antigen, and abnormal digital rectal examination, serum 25-OH D less than 30 ng/mL was associated with increased odds of adverse pathology (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.25 to 5.59; P = .01).  Conclusion:   Insufficiency/deficiency of serum 25-OH D is associated with increased odds of adverse pathology in men with localized disease undergoing radical prostatectomy. Serum 25-OH D may serve as a useful biomarker in prostate cancer aggressiveness, which deserves continued study.""","""['Yaw A Nyame', 'Adam B Murphy', 'Diana K Bowen', 'Gregory Jordan', 'Ken Batai', 'Michael Dixon', 'Courtney M P Hollowell', 'Stephanie Kielb', 'Joshua J Meeks', 'Peter H Gann', 'Virgilia Macias', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'William J Catalona', 'Rick Kittles']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: is there an association with adverse pathologic features?', 'Does prostate volume correlate with vitamin D deficiency among men undergoing prostate biopsy?', 'Vitamin D deficiency predicts prostate biopsy outcomes.', 'Vitamin D and intervention trials in prostate cancer: from theory to therapy.', 'Does Maternal Vitamin D Deficiency Increase the Risk of Preterm Birth: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Regulation of Prostate Androgens by Megalin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D Status: Mechanism for High Prostate Androgens in African American Men.', 'Vitamin D and genetic ancestry are associated with apoptosis rates in benign and malignant prostatic epithelium.', 'The role of the serum 25-OH vitamin D level on detecting prostate cancer in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'S179D Prolactin Sensitizes Human PC3 Prostate Cancer Xenografts to Anti-tumor Effects of Well-Tolerated Doses of Calcitriol.']"""

In the presented study the microbeam setup at the PSI Swiss Light Source combined with fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was applied to determine two-dimensional (2D) imaging of distributions of various chemical sulfur forms in prostate cancer tissue sections, since sulfur is considered important and essential in cancer progression. The research focused on prostate tissues obtained during routine prostatectomies on patients suffering from prostate cancer.Our previous studies using μ-XAS point measurements on prostate cancer cell lines showed the differences in fractions of various forms of sulfur between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Therefore, in this experiment the chosen areas of prostate cancer tissues were scanned to get the full picture of the chemical composition of tissue, which is highly heterogeneous. The incident X-ray beams of energies tuned to spectroscopic features of the near-edge region of sulfur K-edge absorption spectra were used to provide contrast between chemical species presented in the tissue. Next, the relative content of the three main sulfur forms, found in biological systems, was calculated and the results are presented in a form of 2D color maps. These maps are correlated with the microscopic histological image of the scanned area.The main findings show that sulfur occurs in prostate tissue mainly in reduced form.

Methods:   We analyse data on 289 patients with local prostate cancer treated with EBRT (2 Gy per fraction) or EBRT plus one or two BT boosts of 10 Gy each. The timing of ADT was heterogeneous. We develop statistical models to estimate the α/β ratio based upon PSA measurements at 1 year as a surrogate for the surviving fraction of cancer cells as well as combined biochemical + clinical recurrence-free survival (bcRFS), controlling for ADT.  Results:   For the PSA-based end point, the α/β ratio estimate is 7.7 Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1 to 12.5]. Based on the bcRFS end point, the estimate is 18.0 Gy (95% CI: 8.2 to ∞).

Methods:   Sixty-seven men treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) for a low grade (Gleason 6) on biopsy and mp MRI before biopsy were selected. The cycle cell proliferation (CCP) score assessed by the Prolaris test and Ki-67/PTEN expression assessed by immunohistochemistry were quantified on the RP specimens.  Results:   49.25 % of the cancers were undergraded on biopsy compared to the RP specimens. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) < 0.80 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s (P value 0.003), Likert score >4 (P value 0.003) and PSA density >0.15 ng/ml/cc (P value 0.035) were significantly associated with a higher RP Gleason score. Regarding molecular markers of aggressiveness, ADC < 0.80 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and Likert score >4 were also significantly associated with a positive staining for Ki-67 (P value 0.039 and 0.01, respectively).

We sought to examine the effect of sRCC on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) relative to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), after adjusting for other variables, as well as other-cause mortality (OCM).  Methods:   We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database from 2000 to 2009 to identify a cohort of 7916 patients with either sRCC (n = 234) or ccRCC (n = 7682) who received surgery as primary treatment. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were evaluated. Then, 5-year smoothed Poisson regression CSM and OCM estimates were generated for stage-by-stage comparisons between sRCC and ccRCC. A multivariable competing-risks regression model predicting CSM and adjusting for several patient and tumor characteristics, as well as OCM, was finally fitted.  Results:   Compared to ccRCC patients, sRCC patients had more advanced and more aggressive disease at diagnosis. Specifically, 48 and 7 % of sRCC and ccRCC patients presented with stage IV disease, respectively (p < 0.001). Overall, 5-year CSM and OCM estimates were 67 and 17 % for sRCC patients and 14 and 19 % for ccRCC patients. In stage-by-stage analyses, sRCC was invariably associated with worse CSM. After adjusting for several characteristics as well as OCM, sRCC was associated with a 3.2 higher risk of CSM compared with ccRCC.

Little is known about its pattern of usage. This cross-national analysis of individual-level data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden was undertaken to appraise its usage and describe cross-national differences. Materials and methods Individual-level data from nationwide prescription registers in Denmark (1995-2009), Finland (1997-2010), Norway (2004-2009) and Sweden (July 2005-2011) were used to examine cross-national finasteride utilization patterns in the adult male population (≥15 years). The study presents period prevalences, incidence rates, waiting time distributions and Lorenz curves. Results During the study period, 295,620 men had at least one prescription redemption of finasteride 5 mg, and there were approximately 3 million dispensing events of finasteride prescriptions in the four Nordic countries. Different patterns of finasteride use were observed among the four Nordic countries. The period prevalence was markedly higher in Finland and Sweden than in Denmark and Norway. In 2009, period prevalences were 18.2/1000 males in Finland and 12.0/1000 males in Sweden compared to 6.7/1000 males in Norway and 4.9/1000 males in Denmark. Incidence rates of finasteride use for Finland, Norway and Sweden were about three times that for Denmark in 2008-2009.

Materials and methods:   A total of 45 peripheral zone cancer foci from 30 patients who had undergone multiparametric prostate MRI before prostatectomy were identified by a genitourinary pathologist and a radiologist who reviewed histologic findings and MR images. Histologic sections of cancer foci underwent immunohistochemical analysis and were scored according to the percentage of tumor-positive cells expressing PTEN as negative (0-20%), mixed (20-80%), or positive (80-100%). Average and 10th percentile apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, skewness of T2-weighted signal intensity histogram, and quantitative perfusion parameters (i.e., forward volume transfer constant [K(trans)], extravascular extracellular volume fraction [ve], and reverse reflux rate constant between the extracellular space and plasma [k(ep)]) from the Tofts model were calculated for each cancer focus. Associations between the quantitative image features and PTEN expression were analyzed with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r).  Results:   Analysis of the 45 cancer foci revealed that 21 (47%) were PTEN-positive, 12 (27%) were PTEN-negative, and 12 (27%) were mixed. There was a weak but significant negative correlation between Gleason score and PTEN expression (r = -0.30, p = 0.04) and between k(ep) and PTEN expression (r = -0.35, p = 0.02). There was no significant correlation between other multiparametric MRI features and PTEN expression.  Conclusion:   This preliminary study of radiogenomics of peripheral zone prostate cancer revealed weak-but significant-associations between the quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI feature k(ep) and Gleason score with PTEN expression.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 158 men with histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer who underwent 3-T MRI before undergoing prostatectomy in 2011. Whole-mount step-section pathologic maps identified 195 prostate cancer foci that were 0.5 mL or larger; these foci were then volumetrically assessed to calculate the per-tumor ADC and K(trans) values. Associations between MRI and histopathologic parameters were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression, and AUCs.  Results:   The median ADC and K(trans) values showed moderate correlation only for tumors for which the Gleason score (GS) was 4 + 4 or higher (ρ = 0.547; p = 0.042). The tumor ADC value was statistically significantly associated with all dichotomized GSs (p < 0.005), including a GS of 3 + 3 versus a GS of 3 + 4 or higher (AUC, 0.693; p = 0.001). The tumor K(trans) value differed statistically significantly only between tumors with a GS of 3 + 3 and those with a primary Gleason grade of 4 (p ≤ 0.015), and it made a statistically significant contribution only in differentiating tumors with a GS of 4 + 3 or higher (AUC, 0.711; p < 0.001) and those with a GS of 4 + 4 or higher (AUC, 0.788; p < 0.001) from lower-grade tumors.

The tumor suppressor p53 is often inactivated in cancer, either through downregulation of protein or loss-of-function mutations. As such, stabilization of p53 is considered as one promising approach to treat those cancers carrying wild type (WT) p53. Herein, SIRT1 inhibitor Tenovin-1 and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitor BI2536 were used to stabilize p53. We found that both Tennovin-1 and BI2536 increased the anti-neoplastic activity of metformin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, in a p53 dependent manner. Since p53 has also been shown to regulate metabolic pathways, we further analyzed glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation upon drug treatments. We showed that both Tennovin-1 and BI2536 rescued metformin-induced glycolysis and that both Tennovin-1 and BI2536 potentiated metformin-associated inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Of significance, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) C4-2 cells show a much more robust response to the combination treatment than the parental androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, indicating that targeting energy metabolism with metformin plus p53 stabilizers might be a valid approach to treat CRPC carrying WT p53.""","""['Long Chen', 'Nihal Ahmad', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) enhances the antineoplastic activity of metformin in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Plk1 to Enhance Efficacy of Olaparib in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of Plk1 represses androgen signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Battle of the eternal rivals: restoring functional p53 and inhibiting Polo-like kinase 1 as cancer therapy.', 'P53/microRNA-34-induced metabolic regulation: new opportunities in anticancer therapy.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.', 'Present and Future Perspective on PLK1 Inhibition in Cancer Treatment.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'Effects of Metformin Combined With Antifolates on HepG2 Cell Metabolism and Cellular Proliferation.', 'PLK1 inhibition-based combination therapies for cancer management.']"""

Adenoviruses (Ads) are one family of oncolytic viruses. Most human studies have used human Ad serotype 5 (Ad5). Unfortunately, most patients are already immune to Ad5 increasing the likelihood that the agent will be neutralized if used as a cancer therapy. In this work, lower seroprevalence Ad6 was tested as a systemic therapy for prostate cancer. Ad5 and Ad6 were injected intravenously a single time in nude mice bearing human prostate tumors, and toxicity and efficacy were assessed. Ad6 was chemically shielded with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to test if this would further improve its pharmacology. Ad6 produced 30-fold lower liver damage and less toxicity than Ad5. Ad6 significantly repressed the growth of androgen-resistant human DU145 prostate tumors and androgen-sensitive LNCaP tumors after single intravenous injection. PEGylation did not change virus distribution, but blunted liver damage and cytokine production by Ad6.

Materials and methods:   15 patients with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer and visible dominant intra-prostatic nodule on mpMRI have been treated. The treatment consisted of combined MRI-TRUS fusion HDR-brachytherapy (1 fraction of 1500cGy) and hypofractionated external beam (3750cGy in 15 fractions). A dose of 1875Gy was delivered to at least 98% of the DIL volume.  Results:   Median prostate volume was 23.8cc; median number of needles was 16 (13-18). Dose escalation to DIL was feasible in 14/15 patients (93%) without violating dosimetric constraints and 1 patient presented a minimal deviation of dosimetric restrictions. With a median follow-up of 18months (17-24), none of the patients developed acute urinary retention or grade ⩾3 toxicity. In addition to standard PSA follow-up, response has been assessed by mpMRI at 12months. All patients presented adequate morphological responses on anatomical and functional sequences.

A small molecule, napabucasin (BBI608), recently have been identified with suppression of stemness-high cancer cells in a variety of cancers. However, the effects of napabucasin on PCa cells as well as PrCSCs isolated from PCa cells have not yet been defined. The effect of napabucasin on PCa cells in cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro were measured by MTS, colony formation assay, and Transwell, respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell cycle and cell apoptosis, and the effect on tumorigenesis in vivo was examined by tumor growth assays. Furthermore, the role of napabucasin on self-renewal and survival of PrCSCs was evaluated by their ability to grow spheres and cell viability assay, respectively. Western Blot and qRT-PCR were used to determine the effect of napabucasin on the expressions of stemness markers. Decrease in cell viability, colony formation, migration, and survival with cell cycle arrest, higher sensitivity to docetaxel in vitro, and repressed tumorigenesis in vivo was observed upon napabucasin treatment. More importantly, napabucasin can obviously inhibit spherogenesis and even kill PrCSCs in vitro. Downregulation of stemness markers was observed after PrCSCs were treated with napabucasin.

Nonetheless, drug resistance and severe adverse effects have been observed upon using cisplatin. Here, we have explored the cytotoxicity of novel Pt-based compounds on several cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Five synthetic Pt compounds as well as cisplatin were investigated by XTT assay to determine their cytotoxicity against cell lines originated from prostate, ovary, and breast cancers at different time periods at various concentrations. Additionally, the apoptosis rate in cell lines was determined using flow cytometry. Binding to DNA was investigated through spectrophotometric and viscometric studies.  Results:   With the exception of one compound, all of the Pt-complexes effectively killed the prostate cancer cell lines (i.e. PC-3 and DU 145). One compound, [Pt(2,2'- dipyridylamine)Cl4].DMF, was chosen as the most potent compound due to its high selective cytotoxic activity and its cytotoxicity was further tested and compared with that of cisplatin on SKOV-3, Caov-4, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cell lines.

Expression of miR-23b/-27b decreases prostate cancer cell migration, invasion and results in anoikis resistance. Conversely, antagomiR-mediated miR-23b and -27b silencing produces the opposite result in a more indolent prostate cancer cell line. However, neither miR-23b/-27b expression or inhibition impacts prostate cancer cell proliferation suggesting that miR-23b/-27b selectively suppresses metastasis. To examine the effects of miR-23b/-27b on prostate cancer metastasis in vivo, orthotopic prostate xenografts were established using aggressive prostate cancer cells transduced with miR-23b/-27b or non-targeting control miRNA. Although primary tumor formation was similar between miR-23b/-27b-transduced cells and controls, miR-23b/-27b expression in prostate cancer cells decreased seminal vesicle invasion and distant metastases. Gene-expression profiling identified the endocytic adaptor, Huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R) as being downregulated by miR-23b/-27b. Increased HIP1R expression in prostate cancer cells inversely phenocopied the effects of miR-23b/-27b overexpression on migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. HIP1R rescued miR-23b/-27b-mediated repression of migration in prostate cancer cells. HIP1R mRNA levels were decreased in seminal vesicle tissue from mice bearing miR-23b/-27b-transduced prostate cancer cell xenografts compared with scrambled controls, suggesting HIP1R is a key functional target of miR-23b/-27b. In addition, depletion of HIP1R led to a more rounded, less mesenchymal-like cell morphology, consistent with decreased metastatic properties. Together, these data demonstrate that the miR-23b/-27b cluster functions as a metastasis-suppressor by decreasing HIP1R levels in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.""","""['M A Rice', 'R A Ishteiwy', 'F Magani', 'T Udayakumar', 'T Reiner', 'T J Yates', 'P Miller', 'C Perez-Stable', 'P Rai', 'R Verdun', 'D M Dykxhoorn', 'K L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The microRNA -23b/-27b cluster suppresses the metastatic phenotype of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Dual regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase genes EGFR and c-Met by the tumor-suppressive microRNA-23b/27b cluster in bladder cancer.', 'MicroRNA-23b and microRNA-27b plus flutamide treatment enhances apoptosis rate and decreases CCNG1 expression in a castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line.', 'Promising therapeutic role of miR-27b in tumor.', 'Functional significance of aberrantly expressed microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'Quantitative proteomics analysis in small cell carcinoma of cervix reveals novel therapeutic targets.', 'Integrative Analysis and Experimental Validation Indicated That SNHG17 Is a Prognostic Marker in Prostate Cancer and a Modulator of the Tumor Microenvironment via a Competitive Endogenous RNA Regulatory Network.', 'Multivariate competing endogenous RNA network characterization for cancer microRNA biomarker discovery: a novel bioinformatics model with application to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Flurbiprofen inhibits cell proliferation in thyroid cancer through interrupting HIP1R-induced endocytosis of PTEN.']"""

Function of E2F5 and p38 in prostate cancer was investigated using siRNA-treatment of PC3 cell-line followed by analyses of associated components and cell cycle. Observations revealed that E2F5 overexpression was accompanied by significantly higher phosphorylation of SMAD3 at Ser-208 in the linker region (pSMAD3L) and p38 in tumor tissue. A striking difference in SMAD3 phosphorylation, marked by preponderance of pSMAD3L and pSMAD3C (Ser-423 and 425) in tumor and benign tissues, respectively was noted. Co-localization of E2F5 with pSMAD3L in the nuclei of tumor and PC3 cells indicated a functional interface between the proteins. Downregulation of E2F5 and p38 in PC3 cells resulted in marked reduction of phosphorylation of SMAD3 and perturbation of cell cycle with an arrest of cells in G1 . Our findings unearthed that E2F5/p38 axis played a cardinal role in uncontrolled cellular proliferation in prostate cancer through pSMAD3L activation.

Patients and methods:   An international, multicentre, non-interventional, observational, longitudinal, prospective study involving patients from the Triptocare study. CRPC status of patients was collected for up to 3 years from ADT initiation. Patient treatment and assessments were at the investigator's discretion. Co-primary endpoints were rate of CRPC at 3 years after initiating ADT and the median time to CRPC. An exploratory endpoint was the association of Triptocare baseline variables (including TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3 scores) and PCA3 score at Triptocare last value available with CRPC onset.  Results:   Of the 325 patients in the Triptocare study safety population, 180 patients were enrolled in the Triptocare LT study (102 received continuous and 78 received intermittent ADT). CRPC rates at 3 years were 24/102 (23.5%) and 6/78 (7.7%) patients in the continuous and intermittent ADT groups, respectively. The median time to CRPC was not reached for either group. PCA3 score status at baseline was the only variable associated with a higher risk of progression to CRPC in both the intermittent and continuous ADT groups; compared with a baseline PCA3 score of ≥35, a PCA3 score below the level of quantification had a hazard ratio (HR) of 20.04 ([95% confidence interval (CI) 2.71-148.34] and a HR of 9.44 [95% CI 2.39-37.27], respectively). Baseline metastatic disease and testosterone level were additionally associated with progression to CRPC in the continuous ADT population (HR 5.20, 95% CI 1.68-16.06 and HR 0.995, 95% CI 0.991-0.999, respectively).  Conclusion:   In men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, a PCA3 score of ≥35 at the time of initiating ADT may predict a lower risk of developing CRPC in the following 3 years.""","""['Alexandre de la Taille', 'Luis Martínez-Piñeiro', 'Patrick Cabri', 'Aude Houchard', 'Jack Schalken;Triptocare LT Study Group']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Evaluation of urinary prostate cancer antigen-3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2-ERG score changes when starting androgen-deprivation therapy with triptorelin 6-month formulation in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The effect of continuous androgen deprivation treatment on prostate cancer patients as compared with intermittent androgen deprivation treatment.', 'A randomised, double-blind study comparing the addition of bicalutamide with or without dutasteride to GnRH analogue therapy in men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods:   With data from Manitoba, Canada, subjects diagnosed with PC as their first cancer between 1987 and 2009 were age-matched with up to 5 men with no history of invasive cancer on the PC diagnosis date. Subjects were followed to the date of diagnosis of CRC or another cancer, death, emigration, or the study endpoint (December 31, 2009). Competing risk proportional hazards models were used to compare the CRC incidence between those with PC and those without PC with the following model covariates: history of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, frequency of health care visits, diabetes, and socioeconomic status. Mutually exclusive competing outcomes included CRC, another primary cancer, and death.  Results:   For a total of 559,081 person-years, 14,164 men with PC and 69,051 men without PC were followed.

Increasing evidence has shown that BPH is associated with hypoxia microenvironment.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected patient data and tissue samples from fetal prostates(FP), normal prostates(NP), intra-acinar of BPH, peri-acinar of BPH, prostate cancers and sarcomas of prostate. The expression of HIF-1α, as well as VEGF was visualized by immunohistochemistry and statistically analyzed with clinical parameters.  Results:   Expression of HIF-lα was observed in intra-acinar of BPH (69.5%), prostate cancer (85.7%) and all FPs, while NP and peri-acinar of BPH tissues were all stained negative. HIF-lα levels in FPs and the malignant tumors were higher than BPH tissues(p < 0.05), and the expression of HIF-lα in intra-acinar of BPH was higher than NP and peri-acinar of BPH (p < 0.05). The expression of HIF-lα was correlated with the weight of intra-acinar of prostate (p < 0.05). And patients with prostate weight larger that 72.45g were prone to have HIF-lα moderate-positive expression, according to the ROC curve (AUC = 0.734, 95%CI = 0.630-0.838). Moreover, the risk of acute urine retention (AUR) for HIF-lα moderate-positive patients increased significantly (OR=5.517, 95%CI = 2.434-12.504).

A common way of adjusting for these differences is using direct age standardization, which applies age-specific weights from a standard population. Eurostat has recently introduced a revised European standard population (RESP). The effect of using the new standard, in comparison with that introduced in 1976 [European standard population (ESP)], is evaluated. Cancer incidence data for prostate and testis cancer for Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland from the NORDCAN web site, and for Ireland and Italy-Genoa from Cancer Incidence in five Continents-X, were analyzed. Incidence rates were directly age standardized using ESP and RESP. The RESP conferred greater weight to adults and the elderly than the ESP. For prostate cancer, age-standardized rates computed with RESP are consistently higher by between 50 and 60% than those computed with ESP. However, the use of RESP, instead of ESP, has little impact on the pattern of time trends, the relative ranking of countries, the values of relative risks, or the percentage differences between age-standardized rates. For testis cancer, RESP and ESP provide very similar results because this cancer is more common in young men. Both ESP and RESP are in circulation. It is, therefore, important that European cancer registries reach consensus on a single standard to use to avoid erroneous comparisons of data computed with different standards. Given that Eurostat recently introduced RESP and is using this standard for data collected from the European Union Member States, it would make sense to rally behind RESP.""","""['Emanuele Crocetti', 'Tadek Dyba', 'Carmen Martos', 'Giorgia Randi', 'Roisin Rooney', 'Manola Bettio']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality trends among elderly and adult Europeans.', 'Trends in cancer incidence in the Nordic countries.

GB men perceived a number of deficits in HCPs communication: medical support dominated sexual and psychological support; heterosexuality of GB patients was often assumed; sexual orientation disclosure was problematic; and GB men perceived rejection or lack of interest and knowledge from a majority of HCPs with regard to gay sexuality and the impact of PCa on GB men. Facilitators of communication were acknowledgement of sexual orientation and exploration of the impact of PCa on GB men. In order to target improved support for GB men with PCa, it is concluded that HCPs need to address issues of hetero-centricism within PCa care by improving facilitation of sexual orientation disclosure, recognising that GB men with PCa might have specific sexual and relational needs, and increasing knowledge and comfort discussing gay sexuality and gay sexual practices.""","""['D Rose', 'J M Ussher', 'J Perz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Threat of Sexual Disqualification: The Consequences of Erectile Dysfunction and Other Sexual Changes for Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Sexual Orientation Disclosure in Primary Care Settings by Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men in a Canadian City.', 'Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.', 'Methods Used and Topics Addressed in Quantitative Health Research on Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Editorial: Cancer prevention, treatment and survivorship in the LGBTQIA community.', 'Reinforcing or Disrupting Gender Affirmation: The Impact of Cancer on Transgender Embodiment and Identity.', ""LGBTQI cancer patients' quality of life and distress: A comparison by gender, sexuality, age, cancer type and geographical remoteness."", '""Surviving Discrimination by Pulling Together"": LGBTQI Cancer Patient and Carer Experiences of Minority Stress and Social Support.', 'LGBTQI Inclusive Cancer Care: A Discourse Analytic Study of Health Care Professional, Patient and Carer Perspectives.']"""

At this stage, patients develop recurring castrate-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). Interestingly, CRPC tumors maintain dependency on AR for growth; moreover, in CRPCs, constitutively active AR splice variants (e.g., AR-V7) begin to be expressed at higher levels. These splice variants lack the ligand binding domain and are rendered insensitive to current endocrine therapies. Thus, it is of paramount importance to understand what regulates the expression of AR and its splice variants to identify new therapeutic strategies in CRPCs. Here, we used high throughput microscopy and quantitative image analysis to evaluate effects of selected endocrine disruptors on AR levels in multiple breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Bisphenol AP (BPAP), which is used in chemical and medical industries, was identified as a down-regulator of both full length AR and the AR-V7 splice variant. We validated its activity by performing time-course, dose-response, Western blot and qPCR analyses. BPAP also reduced the percent of cells in S phase, which was accompanied by a ~60% loss in cell numbers and colony formation in anchorage-independent growth assays. Moreover, it affected mitochondria size and cell metabolism. In conclusion, our high content analysis-based screening platform was used to classify the effect of compounds on endogenous ARs, and identified BPAP as being capable of causing AR (both full-length and variants) down-regulation, cell cycle arrest and metabolic alterations in CRPC cell lines.""","""['Fabio Stossi', 'Radhika D Dandekar', 'Michael J Bolt', 'Justin Y Newberg', 'Maureen G Mancini', 'Akash K Kaushik', 'Vasanta Putluri', 'Arun Sreekumar', 'Michael A Mancini']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'High-Content Screening Identifies Src Family Kinases as Potential Regulators of AR-V7 Expression and Androgen-Independent Cell Growth.', 'Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in the Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with Next generation Androgen Receptor Signal Inhibition: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', ""Inhibitors of the androgen receptor N‑terminal domain : Therapies targeting the Achilles' heel of various androgen receptor molecules in advanced prostate cancer."", 'Adverse (geno)toxic effects of bisphenol A and its analogues in hepatic 3D cell model.', 'Sensitive image-based chromatin binding assays using inducible ERα to rapidly characterize estrogenic chemicals and mixtures.', 'Quality Control for Single Cell Imaging Analytics Using Endocrine Disruptor-Induced Changes in Estrogen Receptor Expression.', 'Single-Cell Distribution Analysis of AR Levels by High-Throughput Microscopy in Cell Models: Application for Testing Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals.', 'Estrogen-induced transcription at individual alleles is independent of receptor level and active conformation but can be modulated by coactivators activity.']"""

CP110 was previously described for its contribution of centrosome amplification (CA) and early development of aggressive cell behaviour. However its regulation in metastatic cells remains unclear. Here we identified miR-129-3p as a novel metastatic microRNA. CP110 was identified as its target protein. In PCa cells that have metastatic capacity, CP110 expression was repressed by miR-129-3p. High miR-129-3p expression levels increased cell invasion, while increasing CP110 levels decreased cell invasion. Overexpression of CP110 in metastatic PCa cells resulted in a decrease in the number of metastasis. In tissues of PCa patients, low CP110 and high miR-129-3p expression levels correlated with metastasis, but not with the expression of genes related to EMT. Furthermore, overexpression of CP110 in metastatic PCa cells resulted in excessive-CA (E-CA), and a change in F-actin distribution which is in agreement with their reduced metastatic capacity.

Results:   Prediction of RP Gleason score increased from 55 to 68% between 2000 and 2012. Most of the increase occurred before 2005 (nine percentage points; P < 0.001); however, when adjusting for Gleason score and year of diagnosis in a multivariable analysis, the prediction of RP Gleason score decreased over time (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; P < 0.002).

Purpose:   To compare the diagnostic performance of T2* mapping in combination with T2-weighted (T2W) imaging to T2W imaging alone for prostate cancer (PCa) detection.  Material and methods:   The study included 31 patients (mean age, 62 ± 3 years; age range, 45-78 years) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3.0T and histological examination. Three observers with varying experience levels reviewed T2W imaging alone, T2* mapping alone, and T2W imaging combined with T2* mapping. A five-point scale was used to assess the probability of PCa in each segment on MR images. Statistical analysis was performed using Z tests after adjusting for data clustering.  Results:   The area under the curve (AUC) of T2W imaging and T2* mapping data (observer 1, 0.93; observer 2, 0.90; observer 3, 0.77) was higher than T2W imaging (observer 1, 0.84; observer 2, 0.79; observer 3, 0.69) for all observers (P < 0.01 in all comparisons).

A key challenge for their isolation and subsequent analysis is the extreme rarity of these cells in circulation. Here, a novel label-free method is described to enrich viable CTCs directly from whole blood based on their distinct deformability relative to hematological cells. This mechanism leverages the deformation of single cells through tapered micrometer scale constrictions using oscillatory flow in order to generate a ratcheting effect that produces distinct flow paths for CTCs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes. A label-free separation of circulating tumor cells from whole blood is demonstrated, where target cells can be separated from background cells based on deformability despite their nearly identical size. In doping experiments, this microfluidic device is able to capture >90% of cancer cells from unprocessed whole blood to achieve 10(4) -fold enrichment of target cells relative to leukocytes. In patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, where CTCs are not significantly larger than leukocytes, CTCs can be captured based on deformability at 25× greater yield than with the conventional CellSearch system. Finally, the CTCs separated using this approach are collected in suspension and are available for downstream molecular characterization.""","""['Emily S Park', 'Chao Jin', 'Quan Guo', 'Richard R Ang', 'Simon P Duffy', 'Kerryn Matthews', 'Arun Azad', 'Hamidreza Abdi', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Jenny Bazov', 'Kim N Chi', 'Peter C Black', 'Hongshen Ma']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Small""","""['A novel microfluidic platform for size and deformability based separation and the subsequent molecular characterization of viable circulating tumor cells.', 'Microfluidic Separation of Circulating Tumor Cells Based on Size and Deformability.', 'Deformability based Cell Sorting using Microfluidic Ratchets Enabling Phenotypic Separation of Leukocytes Directly from Whole Blood.', 'Size-based separation methods of circulating tumor cells.', 'Affinity Versus Label-Free Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells: Who Wins?', 'Lateral Filter Array Microfluidic Devices for Detecting Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Conductive Nanofibers-Enhanced Microfluidic Device for the Efficient Capture and Electrical Stimulation-Triggered Rapid Release of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Current and Emerging Techniques for Diagnosis and MRD Detection in AML: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.', 'Recent advances in micro-/nanostructure array integrated microfluidic devices for efficient separation of circulating tumor cells.', 'Biomedical Applications of Microfluidic Devices: A Review.']"""

Methods:   The medical records of patients who underwent EBRT between 2003 and 2011 and had nonmetastatic high-risk disease were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were treated with EBRT and all patients received a dose ≥7,560 cGy. Androgen deprivation therapy was given in most patients (90%).  Results:   A total of 155 patients were identified (GS ≤8 n = 104, GS ≥9 n = 51), and they had a median presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 14.7 ng/mL.

As part of these efforts we developed a novel system that uses unambiguous events to define an uncomplicated 30-day postoperative recovery and compares these outcomes across diverse urology practices.  Materials and methods:   MUSIC used a consensus approach to develop an uncomplicated recovery pathway comprising a set of precise perioperative events that are reliably measured and collectively reflect resource utilization, technical complications and coordination of care. Events that occurred outside the uncomplicated recovery pathway were considered deviations, including rectal injury, high blood loss, extended length of stay, prolonged drain or catheter placement, catheter replacement, hospital readmission or mortality. For men undergoing radical prostatectomy trained abstractors prospectively recorded clinical and perioperative data in an electronic registry. When a deviation from the NOTES (Notable Outcomes and Trackable Events after Surgery) pathway occurred, precipitating events were described by abstractors and we analyzed the events.  Results:   From April 2014 through July 2015 a total of 2,245 radical prostatectomies were performed by 100 surgeons in a total of 37 diverse participating MUSIC practices. In the 29 practices in which 10 or more radical prostatectomies were performed during the interval analyzed the risk adjusted deviation rate ranged from 0.0% to 46.1% (p <0.0001). Anastomotic and gastrointestinal events were contributing factors in 50.2% of deviated cases.  Conclusions:   The novel NOTES system provides comparative data on unambiguous and actionable short-term outcomes after radical prostatectomy. The observed variation in outcomes across practices suggests opportunities for quality improvement initiatives. Decreasing anastomotic and gastrointestinal events represents a high impact opportunity for initial quality improvement efforts.""","""['Stacie N Myers', 'Khurshid R Ghani', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Brian R Lane', 'Edward W Schervish', 'Yuqing Gao', 'Susan M Linsell', 'David C Miller', 'James E Montie', 'James M Dupree;for MUSIC']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Use of Routine Home Health Care and Deviations From an Uncomplicated Recovery Pathway After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Patient- and Surgeon-Level Variation in Patient-Reported Sexual Function Outcomes Following Radical Prostatectomy Over 2 Years: Results From a Statewide Surgical Improvement Collaborative.', 'Implementation of a Surgeon-Level Comparative Quality Performance Review to Improve Positive Surgical Margin Rates during Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Quality assurance issues in radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Incidence of Rectal Injury After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Factors Affecting Robotic Partial Nephrectomy Conversion to Radical Nephrectomy: A Retrospective Multi-Institutional Analysis in the Michigan Urologic Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC).', 'The past, present, and future of urological quality improvement collaboratives.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Use of Routine Home Health Care and Deviations From an Uncomplicated Recovery Pathway After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The associations between the expression of MT1-MMP and EMT-associated proteins with clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed. Overexpression of MT1-MMP was confirmed in Kazakh ESCC patients. MT1-MMP levels were found to be correlated with the depth of tumor infiltration. MT1-MMP induced EMT in ESCC both in vivo and in vitro, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression was upregulated upon MT1-MMP transfection into cells. However, E-cadherin was found to be downregulated.

We conducted a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study by using Health Search IMS Health Longitudinal Patient Database (HSD).

Time-dependent multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were adopted to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and related 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of PCa associated with use of LDA. The exposure was lagged by one year to consider the latency of drug effect on the outcome onset. Within a cohort 13,453 patients, the overall incidence rate of PCa was 2.5 per 1,000 person-years. Use of LDA was associated with a decreased incidence rate of PCa (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48-0.86), which was primarily driven by a frequency of LDA use equal to or higher than twice per week (HR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43-0.83).

The postsalvage prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir that best predicts long-term biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) is not yet defined. We sought to determine what nadir PSA best predicted success following salvage whole-gland cryoablation.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 486 hormone-naive patients who underwent salvage whole-gland cryoablation from the Cryo On-Line Database (COLD). Studied variables were age, race, initial PSA, presalvage prostate-specific antigen (psPSA), initial Gleason score, Gleason score at presalvage biopsy, clinical stage, and follow-up PSA values. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was used to calculate 5-year bPFS using the Phoenix criteria. Hazard ratio and relative risk were also analyzed. Differences among the KM estimates, at 5 years, were calculated using the log-rank test.  Results:   Using group thresholds, KM analysis identified nadir PSA less than or greater than 0.4 ng/mL as the nadir PSA threshold, with the greatest difference in bPFS. The KM estimated 5-year bPFS was 75.5% and 22.1% for nadir PSA <0.4 and ≥0.4 ng/mL, respectively. Stratified by psPSA, the KM estimated 5-year bPFS comparing patients with PSA nadir <0.4 vs ≥0.4 ng/mL was 78.5% and 17.9% (p < 0.0001) for psPSA <4 ng/mL, 77.1% and 15.7% (p < 0.0001) for psPSA 4-10 ng/mL, and 77.8% and 16.8% (p < 0.0001) for psPSA >10 ng/mL, respectively.

Methods:   A retrospective search was performed to identify patients who had an extended transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle core biopsy between 2008 and 2013.  Results:   One thousand one prostate biopsies were analyzed. Total core length (mean 13.2-22.9 cm, P < .001) significantly varied by submitting urologist but did not impact cancer detection rate per case.

Materials and methods:   Patients scheduled for prostatectomy were scanned by 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with DWI based on b-values 0-500-1000-1500 s/mm(2) . A monoexponential model was fitted to obtain ADC using multiple b-values, with or without b0 (perfusion-sensitive ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 , perfusion-insensitive ADC3b-b500-1000-1500 ), or two b-values (ADC2b-b0-500 , ADC2b-b0-1000 , ADC2b-b0-1500 ). Prostate and cancer foci were segmented to label voxels as normal or tumoral, according to histology. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for each ADC and b-value, then for multivariate logistic regression models combining them. A threshold of 85 tumoral voxels (=0.5 cm(3) ) was used to stratify AUC analysis.  Results:   In all, 21 patients were selected. Segmentation collected 143,665 prostatic voxels including 10,069 tumoral voxels. In five patients, tumor segmentation provided fewer than 85 voxels, resulting in an ADC with AUC inferior to 0.52. In 16 patients with larger tumors, perfusion-sensitive ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 performed better than perfusion-insensitive ADC3b-b500-1000-1500 and similar to ADC2b-b0-1500 (AUC of 0.840, 0.809, and 0.838, respectively). In comparison to the ADC alone, models combining ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 or ADC2b-b0-1500 with b1500 improved performance, leading to similar AUCs of 0.884 and 0.883, respectively.

The goal of this study was to assess the impact of treatment of the primary tumor on survival in men who go onto receive chemotherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER)-Medicare data from 1992 to 2009, we identified a cohort of 1614 men who received chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Primary outcomes were prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM). We compared survival among men who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), or neither of these therapies. Propensity score adjusted Cox proportional hazard models and weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess survival.  Results:   Compared to men who received no local treatment, PCSM was lower for men who received RP ± RT (HR 0.65, p < 0.01) and for those who received RT only (HR 0.79, p < 0.05). Patients receiving neither RP nor RT demonstrated higher PCSM and ACM than those receiving treatment in a weighted time-to-event analysis. Men who received RP + RT had longer mean time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy (100.7 ± 47.7 months) than men with no local treatment (48.8 ± 35.0 months, p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   In patients who go on to receive chemotherapy, treatment of the primary tumor for prostate cancer appears to confer a survival advantage over those who do not receive primary treatment.

Serum PSA and BMI were assessed among 15,827 men at baseline in 2010-2012. During follow-up, 735 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer with 282 (38.4%) classified as high-grade cancers. Multivariable linear regression models and natural cubic linear regression splines were fitted for analyses of BMI and log-PSA. For risk analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and natural cubic Cox regression splines producing standardized cancer-free probabilities were fitted. Results showed that baseline Serum PSA decreased by 1.6% (95% CI: -2.1 to -1.1) with every one unit increase in BMI.

No statistically significant associations were seen between BMI and prostate cancer risk although results were indicative of a positive association to incidence rates of high-grade disease and an inverse association to incidence of low-grade disease.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of contrast materials in bladder on the dosimetry during prostate intensity modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy. The study also investigates the difference of the two dose calculation options namely 'dose to medium (Dm)' and 'dose to water (Dw)' in a commercial Monte Carlo based treatment planning system. Eight IMRT treatment plans were retrospectively studied which were used to treat high risk prostate cancer patients. The treatment plans generated in Monaco treatment planning system use seven coplanar beams and calculated 'Dm' as the clinical option. These plans were recalculated, keeping the segments, beam angle and monitor units the same, with different relative electron densities assigned to the structure 'bladder' to mimic the presence of contrast material. The same plans were recalculated using the 'Dw' option. Further, keeping the IMRT constraints and plan calculation properties the same, these plans were re-optimised with the delivery method changed to volumetric modulated arc therapy and calculated using both 'Dm' and 'Dw' options. For all the four scenarios, it was found that for the target volumes CTV and PTV, 'minimum dose' is the only endpoint studied having a significant difference with the presence of contrast material. For bladder, the endpoint V40 Gy is affected. Any significant dosimetric effect is found only when the relative electron density of the contrast material is 1.2 or more.

P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is also dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer. However, the impact of p38 MAPK signaling on DKK-1 remains unknown. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling in osteolytic PC3 cells by small molecule inhibitors (doramapimod, LY2228820 and SB202190) suppressed DKK-1 expression, whereas activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin increased DKK-1. Further dissection by targeting individual p38 MAPK isoforms with siRNA revealed a stronger role for MAPK11 than MAPK14 and MAPK12 in the regulation of DKK-1. Moreover, prostate cancer cells with a predominantly osteolytic phenotype produced sufficient amounts of DKK-1 to inhibit Wnt3a-induced osteoblastic differentiation in C2C12 cells. This inhibition was blocked directly by neutralizing DKK-1 using a specific antibody and also indirectly by blocking p38 MAPK. Furthermore, tissue expression in human prostate cancer revealed a correlation between p38 MAPK and DKK-1 expression with higher expression in tumor compared with normal tissues. These results reveal that p38 MAPK regulates DKK-1 in prostate cancer and may present a potential target in osteolytic prostate cancers.""","""['A J Browne', 'A Göbel', 'S Thiele', 'L C Hofbauer', 'M Rauner', 'T D Rachner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['P38 regulates the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 in breast cancer.', 'Vitamin A (retinol) downregulates the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) by oxidant-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and NF-kB in human lung cancer A549 cells.', 'Human prostate luminal cell differentiation requires NOTCH3 induction by p38-MAPK and MYC.', 'Role of Wnts in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Role of p38 MAP kinase in cancer stem cells and metastasis.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Construction of a novel anoikis-related prognostic model and analysis of its correlation with infiltration of immune cells in neuroblastoma.', 'DNMT1 and p38γ are inversely expressed in reactive non-metastatic lymph nodes burdened with colorectal adenocarcinoma.', 'Functional Roles of JNK and p38 MAPK Signaling in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Diversity of Vascular Niches in Bones and Joints During Homeostasis, Ageing, and Diseases.']"""

Earlier we reported that Withaferin-A (WA), a small herbal molecule, induces pro-apoptotic response-4 (Par-4) mediated apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that inhibition of AKT facilitates nuclear shuttling of FOXO3a where it regulates Par-4 transcription in CRPC cells. FOXO3a is upstream of Par-4 signaling, which is required for induction of apoptosis in CRPC cells. Promoter bashing studies and Ch-IP analysis confirm a direct interaction of FOXO3a and Par-4; a sequential deletion of FOXO3a-binding sites in the Par-4 promoter fails to induce Par-4 activation. To confirm these observations, we either overexpressed AKT or silenced FOXO3a activation in CRPC cells. Both methods inhibit Par-4 function and apoptosis is significantly compromised. In xenograft tumors derived from AKT-overexpressed CRPC cells, FOXO3a and Par-4 expression is downregulated, leading to aggressive tumor growth. Oral administration of WA to mice with xenograft tumors restores FOXO3a-mediated Par-4 functions and results in inhibited tumor growth. Finally, an inverse correlation of nuclear localization of AKT expression corresponds to cytoplasmic Par-4 localization in human prostate tissue array. Our studies suggest that Par-4 is one of the key transcriptional targets of FOXO3a, and Par-4 activation is required for induction of apoptosis in CRPC cells. Activation of FOXO3a appears to be an attractive target for the treatment of CRPC and molecules such as WA can be explored further for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['T P Das', 'S Suman', 'H Alatassi', 'M K Ankem', 'C Damodaran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Shikonin induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells via activation of FOXO3a/EGR1/SIRT1 signaling antagonized by p300.', 'S-equol, a Secondary Metabolite of Natural Anticancer Isoflavone Daidzein, Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth In Vitro and In Vivo, Though Activating the Akt/FOXO3a Pathway.', '18β-glycyrrhetinic acid induces apoptosis through modulation of Akt/FOXO3a/Bim pathway in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.', 'FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Progress in studies.', 'The pro-survival function of Akt kinase can be overridden or altered to contribute to induction of apoptosis.', 'Withaferin A: A Pleiotropic Anticancer Agent from the Indian Medicinal Plant Withania somnifera (L.)

Patients and methods:   Patients with CLL who survived >10 years were defined as LTSs of CLL. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to compare the incidence of OC in LTS of CLL versus the general population. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of OC. Overall survival was analyzed as a function of the presence of OC.  Results:   Among 797 LTSs of CLL, the cumulative frequency of OC was 36%, similar between 570 patients (72%) who required treatment for CLL (TRT) and 227 (28%) who remained untreated (UT). The most common OC in both groups was non-melanoma skin cancer, followed by prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia in TRT patients, and by prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and gastrointestinal tumors in the UT group. The SIR for all OC was 1.2 (P = 0.034). It was higher in males (SIR 1.31; P = 0.013) and patients <60 years (SIR 1.27; P = 0.027). A higher SIR was shown for secondary leukemia, melanoma, and head-and-neck cancers, whereas a lower SIR was found for gastrointestinal and bladder cancers. Independent predictors of OC development were advanced age, male gender, and lower platelets. The survival of patients with OC was 16.2 months and that of patients without OC 22.9 years.  Conclusions:   LTSs of CLL have an increased incidence of OC compared with the general population. CLL therapy is not a risk factor for OC in LTSs of CLL.

This study evaluated the serial application of these measurements as systemic treatment response markers and predictors of disease progression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Forty-two patients completed sequential (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT scans before and 1-3 mo after starting treatment for CRPC. Whole-body tumor segmentation was applied to determine net MATV from each scan. Changes in net MATV were evaluated as predictors of time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results:   Treatments consisted of chemotherapy in 16 patients, antiandrogens in 19 patients, (223)Ra-dichloride in 5 patients, and sipuleucel-T in 2 patients. A significant MATV response (defined as a ≥30% decrease in net MATV) was observed in 20 patients on the basis of in-treatment PET/CT performed an average of 51 d (median, 49 d) into treatment. Significantly longer times to PSA progression were observed in patients who exhibited an MATV response (418 d vs. 116 d, P = 0.0067). MATV response was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.246 (P = 0.0113) for PSA progression, which remained significant when adjusted for treatment type.  Conclusion:   Significant changes in whole-body tumor burden can be measured on (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT over the course of contemporary treatments for CRPC. In this study, these changes were found to be predictive of PSA progression as a potential surrogate marker of treatment outcome.

Current treatments include surgery, androgen ablation and radiation. Introduction of more targeted therapies in prostate cancer, based on a detailed knowledge of the signalling pathways, aims to reduce side effects, leading to better clinical outcomes for the patient. ADAM19 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 19) is a transmembrane and soluble protein which can regulate cell phenotype through cell adhesion and proteolysis. ADAM19 has been positively associated with numerous diseases, but has not been shown to be a tumor suppressor in the pathogenesis of any human cancers. Our group sought to investigate the role of ADAM19 in human prostate cancer.  Methods:   ADAM19 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in well characterised human prostate cancer cohorts. ADAM19 expression was assessed in normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC3) using western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Proliferation assays were conducted in LNCaP cells in which ADAM19 was over-expressed. In vitro scratch assays were performed in PC3 cells over-expressing ADAM19.  Results:   Immunohistochemical studies highlighted that ADAM19 protein levels were elevated in normal prostate tissue compared to prostate cancer biopsies. Results from the clinical cohorts demonstrated that high levels of ADAM19 in microarrays are positively associated with lower stage (p = 0.02591) and reduced relapse (p = 0.00277) of human prostate cancer. In vitro, ADAM19 expression was higher in RWPE-1 cells compared to LNCaP cells. In addition, human ADAM19 over-expression reduced LNCaP cell proliferation and PC3 cell migration.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our immunohistochemical and microarray results and cellular studies have shown for the first time that ADAM19 is a protective factor for human prostate cancer. Further, this study suggests that upregulation of ADAM19 expression could be of therapeutic potential in human prostate cancer.""","""['Gerard Hoyne', 'Caroline Rudnicka', 'Qing-Xiang Sang', 'Mark Roycik', 'Sarah Howarth', 'Peter Leedman', 'Markus Schlaich', 'Patrick Candy', 'Vance Matthews']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Overexpression of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase ADAM15 is linked to a Small but Highly Aggressive Subset of Prostate Cancers.', 'Immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 predicts outcome after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'MiR-153 inhibits migration and invasion of human non-small-cell lung cancer by targeting ADAM19.', 'ADAM19/adamalysin 19 structure, function, and role as a putative target in tumors and inflammatory diseases.', 'Validation of proposed prostate cancer biomarkers with gene expression data: a long road to travel.', 'Role of circular RNAs in retinoblastoma.', 'Genome-wide mapping of somatic mutation rates uncovers drivers of cancer.', 'ADAM19 and TUBB1 Correlate with Tumor Infiltrating Immune Cells and Predicts Prognosis in Osteosarcoma.', 'Circular RNA circSmoc1-2 regulates vascular calcification by acting as a miR-874-3p sponge in vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.']"""

Methods:   Large-scale qualitative data were obtained from Dailystrength.org. Based on a hand-coded training dataset, all posts were classified into informational or emotional using a Bayesian classification algorithm to generalize the findings. Posts that could not be classified with a probability of at least 75% were excluded.  Results:   The overall tendency toward emotional posts differs by condition: mental health (depression, schizophrenia) and Alzheimer's disease consist of more emotional posts, while informational posts relate more to nonterminal physical conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, asthma). There is no gender difference across conditions, although prostate cancer forums are oriented toward informational support, whereas breast cancer forums rather feature emotional support. Across diseases, the best predictors for emotional content are lower age and a higher number of overall posts by the support group member.  Discussion:   The results are in line with previous empirical research and unify empirical findings from single/2-condition research. Limitations include the analytical restriction to predefined categories (informational, emotional) through the chosen machine-learning approach.  Conclusion:   Our findings provide an empirical foundation for building theory on informational versus emotional support across conditions, give insights for practitioners to better understand the role of online support groups for different patients, and show the usefulness of machine-learning approaches to analyze large-scale qualitative health data from online settings.""","""['Ulrike Deetjen', 'John A Powell']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Am Med Inform Assoc""","""['Eliciting and receiving online support: using computer-aided content analysis to examine the dynamics of online social support.', 'Comparison of social support content within online communities for high- and low-survival-rate cancers.', 'Peer Communication in Online Mental Health Forums for Young People: Directional and Nondirectional Support.', 'Systematic review on Internet Support Groups (ISGs) and depression (2): What is known about depression ISGs?', 'Meeting the support needs of patients with complex regional pain syndrome through innovative use of wiki technology: a mixed-methods study.', 'Social Support in a Diabetes Online Community: Mixed Methods Content Analysis.', 'Caring for a Family Member with Psychosis or Bipolar Disorder Who Has Experienced Suicidal Behaviour: An Exploratory Qualitative Study of an Online Peer-Support Forum.', 'Online Health Information Seeking Among Patients With Chronic Conditions: Integrating the Health Belief Model and Social Support Theory.', 'The role of machine learning in developing non-magnetic resonance imaging based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis: a\xa0systematic\xa0review.', 'Internet Use among Patients with Schizophrenia and Depression.']"""

Methods:   Two thousand four hundred ninety-three men belonging to the EUREKA-2 retrospective multi-centric database on prostate cancer and treated with external-beam radiotherapy as primary treatment comprised the study population. A Cox regression time to PSA failure analysis was performed in univariate and multivariate settings, evaluating the predictive ability of age, pre-treatment PSA, clinical-radiological staging, Gleason score and percentage of positive cores at biopsy (%PC). The accuracy of this model was checked with bootstrapping statistics. Subgroups for all the variables' combinations were combined to classify patients into five different ""Candiolo"" risk-classes for biochemical Progression Free Survival (bPFS); thereafter, they were also applied to clinical PFS (cPFS), systemic PFS (sPFS) and Prostate Cancer Specific Survival (PCSS), and compared to D'Amico risk grouping performances.  Results:   The Candiolo classifier splits patients in 5 risk-groups with the following 10-years bPFS, cPFS, sPFS and PCSS: for very-low-risk 90 %, 94 %, 100 % and 100 %; for low-risk 74 %, 88 %, 94 % and 98 %; for intermediate-risk 60 %, 82 %, 91 % and 92 %; for high-risk 43 %, 55 %, 80 % and 89 % and for very-high-risk 14 %, 38 %, 56 % and 70 %.

The Hh signaling pathway has been one of the most intensely investigated targets for cancer therapy, and a number of compounds inhibiting Hh signaling are being tested clinically for treating many cancers. Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) combined. Cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. To find novel strategies for combating lung cancer, we decided to characterize the effect of cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), an improved analogue of cyclopamine, on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action.  Methods:   The effect of CycT on oxygen consumption and proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was quantified by using an Oxygraph system and live cell counting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining. CycT's impact on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology in NSCLC cells was monitored by using fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy were used to detect the levels and localization of Hh signaling targets, mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, and heme-related proteins in various NSCLC cells.  Results:   Our findings identified a novel function of CycT, as well as another Hh inhibitor SANT1, to disrupt mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our results showed that CycT, like glutamine depletion, caused a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines, suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Further, we found that CycT increased ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial function in NSCLC cells.  Conclusions:   Together, our work demonstrates that CycT, and likely other Hh signaling inhibitors, can interrupt NSCLC cell function by promoting mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation, thereby diminishing mitochondrial respiration, suppressing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis. Our work provides novel mechanistic insights into the action of Hh inhibitors in cancer cells.""","""['Md Maksudul Alam', 'Sagar Sohoni', 'Sarada Preeta Kalainayakan', 'Massoud Garrossian', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Cyclopamine tartrate, a modulator of hedgehog signaling and mitochondrial respiration, effectively arrests lung tumor growth and progression.', 'Tumor shrinkage by cyclopamine tartrate through inhibiting hedgehog signaling.', 'Promotion of p53 expression and reactive oxidative stress production is involved in zerumbone-induced cisplatin sensitization of non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'The Hedgehog Signaling Networks in Lung Cancer: The Mechanisms and Roles in Tumor Progression and Implications for Cancer Therapy.', 'Blockade of hedgehog signaling pathway as a therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.', 'Glutathione Programmed Mitochondria Targeted Delivery of Lonidamine for Effective Against Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Targeting the Host Mitochondria as a Novel Human Cytomegalovirus Antiviral Strategy.', 'Comparative transcriptome analysis of Veratrum maackii and Veratrum nigrum reveals multiple candidate genes involved in steroidal alkaloid biosynthesis.', 'Emerging Roles of NDUFS8 Located in Mitochondrial Complex I in Different Diseases.', 'Identification of the mitochondrial protein ADCK2 as a therapeutic oncotarget of NSCLC.']"""

Within the circulatory system, platelets guard circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from immune elimination and promote their arrest at the endothelium, supporting CTC extravasation into secondary sites. Neutralization of CTCs in blood circulation can potentially attenuate metastases to distant organs. Therefore, extensive studies have explored the blockade of platelet-CTC interactions as an anti-metastatic strategy. Such an intervention approach, however, may cause bleeding disorders since the platelet-CTC interactions inherently rely on the blood coagulation cascade including platelet activation. On the other hand, platelets have been genetically engineered to correct inherited bleeding disorders in both animal models and human clinical trials. In this study, inspired by the physical association between platelets and CTCs, platelets were genetically modified to express surface-bound tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a cytokine known to induce apoptosis specifically in tumor cells. The TRAIL-expressing platelets were demonstrated to kill cancer cells in vitro and significantly reduce metastases in a mouse model of prostate cancer metastasis.

However, the molecular mechanism of CXCR7 ligand-independent EGFR transactivation is unknown. We used cDNA knock-in, RNAi and analysis of mitogenic signaling components in both normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells to decipher the proliferation-inducing mechanism of the CXCR7-EGFR interaction. The data demonstrate that CXCR7-induced EGFR transactivation is independent of both the release of cryptic EGFR ligands (e.g., AREG/amphiregulin) and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. An alternate signaling mechanism involving β-arrestin-2 (ARRB2/β-AR2) was examined by manipulating the levels of β-AR2 and analyzing changes in LNCaP cell growth and phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, Src, and Akt. Depletion of β-AR2 in LNCaP cells increased proliferation/colony formation and significantly increased activation of Src, phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-1110, and phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2 compared with that with control shRNA. Moreover, β-AR2 depletion downregulated the proliferation suppressor p21. Stimulation of β-AR2-expressing cells with EGF resulted in rapid nuclear translocation of phosphorylated/activated EGFR. Downregulation of β-AR2 enhanced this nuclear translocation. These results demonstrate that β-AR2 is a negative regulator of CXCR7/Src/EGFR-mediated mitogenic signaling.  Implications:   This study reveals that β-AR2 functions as a tumor suppressor, underscoring its clinical importance in regulating CXCR7/EGFR-mediated tumor cell proliferation.

In this study, we sequenced and characterized somatic mutations in aggressive (Gleason ≥7, stage ≥T2b) prostate tumors from 24 African American patients. We describe the locations and prevalence of small somatic mutations (up to 50 bases in length), copy number aberrations, and structural rearrangements in the tumor genomes compared with patient-matched normal genomes.

However, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions and PTEN losses occurred in only 21% and 8% of the African American patients, respectively, far less common than in patients of European ancestry. We also identified mutations that appeared specific to or more common in African American patients, including a novel CDC27-OAT gene fusion occurring in 17% of patients.

While cancer stem-like cells have been implicated as a cell of origin for prostate cancer metastasis, the pathways that enable metastatic development at distal sites remain largely unknown. In this study, we illuminate pathways relevant to bone metastasis in this disease. We observed that cyclin A1 (CCNA1) protein expression was relatively higher in prostate cancer metastatic lesions in lymph node, lung, and bone/bone marrow. In both primary and metastatic tissues, cyclin A1 expression was also correlated with aromatase (CYP19A1), a key enzyme that directly regulates the local balance of androgens to estrogens. Cyclin A1 overexpression in the stem-like ALDH(high) subpopulation of PC3M cells, one model of prostate cancer, enabled bone marrow integration and metastatic growth. Further, cells obtained from bone marrow metastatic lesions displayed self-renewal capability in colony-forming assays. In the bone marrow, cyclin A1 and aromatase enhanced local bone marrow-releasing factors, including androgen receptor, estrogen and matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 and promoted the metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, ALDH(high) tumor cells expressing elevated levels of aromatase stimulated tumor/host estrogen production and acquired a growth advantage in the presence of host bone marrow cells. Overall, these findings suggest that local production of steroids and MMPs in the bone marrow may provide a suitable microenvironment for ALDH(high) prostate cancer cells to establish metastatic growths, offering new approaches to therapeutically target bone metastases.

Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the ORs for prostate cancer based on the study-specific fifth of each analyte.

However, heterogeneity between the prospective and cross-sectional studies was evident (Pheterogeneity = 0.03), unless the analyses were restricted to prospective studies (with the exception of IGF-II, Pheterogeneity = 0.02). For prospective studies, the OR for men in the highest versus the lowest fifth of each analyte was 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.43) for IGF-I, 0.81 (0.68-0.96) for IGFBP-1, and 1.25 (1.12-1.40) for IGFBP-3.

However, this dichotomization may oversimplify the continuous spectrum of absolute percent Gleason grade 4 disease (G4%). In this study we report the prognostic value of G4% in cancer related outcomes of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized Gleason 6-8 prostate cancer from 2005 to 2013 were included in the study. G4% was determined as biopsy tumor length containing Gleason pattern 4/total tumor length, which performed better than alternative quantifications of pattern 4 involvement. G4% was correlated with time to biochemical recurrence and presence of adverse radical prostatectomy pathology, defined as primary Gleason 4 or pT3 or greater, by multivariable Cox and logistic regressions.  Results:   Of 1,691 patients 517 (30.6%) had adverse pathological features and 86 (5.6%) experienced biochemical recurrence. On multivariable analyses G4% was a significant predictor of adverse pathology (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05) and time to biochemical recurrence (HR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.03). G4% was also a significant independent predictor of adverse pathology in subsets of patients with Gleason score 7 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), 3+4 (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.08) and 4+3 cancer (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06). We found a significantly increased risk of adverse pathology at potentially meaningful G4% thresholds (1% to 10% vs 20% to 30%).  Conclusions:   The incremental percentage of Gleason grade 4 disease in biopsy specimens is an important predictor of adverse pathology and biochemical recurrence across the entire range of G4% disease. Accounting for G4% can improve risk assessment even among those patients with Gleason 3+4 or 4+3 cancer and may help inform patient counseling.""","""['Adam I Cole', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Ganesh S Palapattu', 'Chang He', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Alon Z Weizer', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Angela Wu', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Jeffrey S Montgomery', 'Lakshmi P Kunju', 'David C Miller', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'John T Wei', 'Rohit Mehra']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Gleason Score 7: When Qualitative Change Becomes Quantitative Change.', 'Percent prostate needle biopsy tissue with cancer is more predictive of biochemical failure or adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy than prostate specific antigen or Gleason score.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Radical prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Updates on Grading and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Histology and PSMA Expression on Immunohistochemistry in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Comparison with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Features in Primary Staging.', 'The highest percentage of Gleason Pattern 4 is a predictor in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Histopathological Study of the Prostate Cancer Growth Patterns in Relation with the Grading Systems.', 'Risk Estimation of Metastatic Recurrence After Prostatectomy: A Model Using Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Targeted Biopsy.', 'The utility of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis in the Australian setting.']"""

Materials and methods:   We identified men with previously diagnosed Gleason score 3+3 prostate cancer on active surveillance who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and a followup prostate biopsy. Suspicion for higher grade cancer was scored on a standardized 5-point scale. All patients underwent a systematic biopsy. Patients with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging regions of interest also underwent magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy. The detection rate of higher grade cancer was estimated for different multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scores with the 3 biopsy strategies of systematic, magnetic resonance imaging targeted and combined.  Results:   Of 206 consecutive men on active surveillance 135 (66%) had a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging region of interest. Overall, higher grade cancer was detected in 72 (35%) men. A higher multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging score was associated with an increased probability of detecting higher grade cancer (Wilcoxon-type trend test p <0.0001). Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy detected higher grade cancer in 23% of men. Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy alone missed higher grade cancers in 17%, 12% and 10% of patients with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scores of 3, 4 and 5, respectively.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies increased the detection of higher grade cancer among men on active surveillance compared to systematic biopsy alone. However, a clinically relevant proportion of higher grade cancer was detected using only systematic biopsy. Despite the improved detection of disease progression using magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy, systematic biopsy cannot be excluded as part of surveillance for men with low risk prostate cancer.""","""['Pedro Recabal', 'Melissa Assel', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Daniel Lee', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Karim Touijer', 'James A Eastham', 'Hebert A Vargas', 'Jonathan Coleman', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy to Transperineal Template Mapping Biopsies Stratified by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score in the PROMIS Trial.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'The current role of MRI for guiding active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Success of targeted transperineal biopsy in patients on surveillance for grade group 1 prostate cancer.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'In-Bore MRI-guided Prostate Biopsies: Retrospective Observational Study of Complementary Nontargeted Sampling of Normal-appearing Areas at Multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical variables: Which is the best combination to predict reclassification in active surveillance patients?']"""

A dose-escalation map was derived considering individual, multi-parametric estimated tumour aggressiveness.  Methods and materials:   Multi-parametric functional imaging (MRI, Choline-/PSMA-/FMISO-PET/CT) was acquired for a high risk prostate cancer patient with a high level of tumour load (cT3b cN0 cM0) indicated by subtotal involvement of prostate including the right seminal vesicle and by PSA-level >100. Probability of tumour presence was determined by a combination of multi-parametric functional image information resulting in a voxel-based map of tumour aggressiveness. This probability map was directly integrated into dose optimization in order to plan for inhomogeneous, biological imaging based dose painting. Histograms of the multi-parametric prescription function were generated in addition to a differential histogram of the planned inhomogeneous doses. Comparison of prescribed doses with planned doses on a voxel level was realized using an effective DVH, containing the ratio of prescribed vs. planned dose for each tumour voxel.  Results:   Multi-parametric imaging data of PSMA, Choline and FMISO PET/CT as well as ADC maps derived from diffusion weighted MRI were combined to an individual probability map of tumour presence. Voxel-based prescription doses ranged from 75.3Gy up to 93.4Gy (median: 79.6Gy), whereas the planned dose painting doses varied only between 72.5 and 80.0Gy with a median dose of 75.7Gy. However, inhomogeneous voxel-based dose prescriptions can only be implemented into a treatment plan until a certain level.  Conclusion:   Multi-parametric probability based dose painting in prostate cancer is technically and clinically feasible.

Methods:   Retrospectively evaluated were 1545 biopsy cores of 774 intraprostatic lesions (two cores per lesion) in 290 patients (66 ± 7.8 years; median PSA 8.2 ng/ml) regarding prostate cancer (PCa) detection, Gleason score, and tumor infiltration of the first (FBC) compared to the second biopsy core (SBC). Biopsies were acquired under in-bore MR-guidance.  Results:   For the biopsy cores, 491 were PCa positive, 239 of 774 (31 %) were FBC and 252 of 771 (33 %) were SBC (p = 0.4). Patient PCa detection rate based on the FBC vs. SBC were 46 % vs. 48 % (p = 0.6). For clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥4 + 3 = 7) the detection rate was 18 % for both, FBC and SBC (p = 0.9). Six hundred and eighty-seven SBC (89 %) showed no histologic difference. On the lesion level, 40 SBC detected PCa with negative FBC (7.5 %). Twenty SBC showed a Gleason upgrade from 3 + 3 = 6 to ≥3 + 4 = 7 (2.6 %) and 4 to ≥4 + 3 = 7 (0.5 %).  Conclusion:   The benefit of a second targeted biopsy core per suspicious MRI-lesion is likely minor, especially regarding PCa detection rate and significant Gleason upgrading. Therefore, a further reduction of biopsy cores is reasonable when performing a targeted MR-guided in-bore prostate biopsy.  Key points:   • Higher PI-RADS overall score (IV-V) correlated well with PCa detection rate • In more than 80 % SBC was concordant regarding overall PCa detection • In almost 90 % there was no Gleason upgrading by the SBC • Only 2/54 (3.7 %) csPCa was missed when the SBC was omitted • For IB-GB a further reduction of biopsy cores is reasonable.""","""['L Schimmöller', 'M Quentin', 'D Blondin', 'F Dietzel', 'A Hiester', 'C Schleich', 'C Thomas', 'R Rabenalt', 'H E Gabbert', 'P Albers', 'G Antoch', 'C Arsov']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy-Are 2 Biopsy Cores per Magnetic Resonance Imaging Lesion Required?', 'Diagnostic Yield of Incremental Biopsy Cores and Second Lesion Sampling for In-Gantry MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Analysis of PI-RADS 4 cases: Management recommendations for negatively biopsied patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasonography fusion guided seed placement in a phantom: Accuracy between 2-seed versus 1-seed strategies.', 'Comparison of analgesic techniques in MRI-guided in-bore prostate biopsy.', 'Controversies in MR targeted biopsy: alone or combined, cognitive versus software-based fusion, transrectal versus transperineal approach?', 'MRI-guided in-bore biopsy for prostate cancer: what does the evidence say?

The aim of this study was to perform image-based absorbed dose calculation for critical organs during the first cycle of [(177)Lu]DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy in a small cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Procedures:   Nine patients with a history of prostate cancer documented by histopathology and radiologic evidence of metastatic diseases underwent radioligand therapy with [(177)Lu]DKFZ-PSMA-617. Conjugated planar whole-body scintigraphies acquired at 0.5, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h post-injection were analyzed by regions of interest, and time-activity curves were generated for various organs. Cumulated activities and residence times were calculated by bi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Mean absorbed doses were finally estimated using OLINDA/EXM1.1™. Additionally, the uncertainty when omitting the last measurement (168 h p.i.) was studied.  Results:   The following mean absorbed doses were calculated: 2.82 mGy/MBq for the lacrimal glands, 0.72 mGy/MBq for the salivary glands, 0.53 mGy/MBq for the kidneys, and 0.42 mGy/MBq for the nasal mucous membrane. Omitting the last measurement resulted in a mean deviation of 10 to 25 % for absorbed dose values as compared to the ones received by analyzing all measurements.  Conclusion:   Absorbed organ doses of [(177)Lu]DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy are not likely to be critical for kidneys, salivary glands, and the nasal mucous membrane. The lacrimal glands may represent the dose-limiting organs.

The Serine/threonine protein kinase ULK2 (unc-51 like kinase 2) plays an important regulatory role in autophagy thanks to its involvement in mTOR-regulated-initiation and downstream ATG protein-related progression of this catabolic process. An increasing number of miRNAs have been found to modulate autophagy by targeting some ATG genes. In this study, we focus on the role of mir-26b in autophagy in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We found that miR-26b inhibited autophagy in PC-3 and C4-2 cells, through down-regulation of ULK2 expression. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-26b binds the 3'UTR of ULK2, suggesting that ULK2 is a direct target of miR-26b. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed that over-expression of miR-26b reduced ULK2 mRNA and protein levels. Our results showed also that miR-26b was down-regulated in LNCaP, DU145, C4-2 and PC-3 cells compared to the two normal prostate cells RWPE-1 and WPMY-1 except DU145 cells. This inversely correlates with ULK2 level in the same cell lines. Expression level of ULK2 in tissues microarray (TMA) of prostate cancer derived from 96 patients positively correlated with the pathologic stage of the patients (∗P < 0.05). Over-expression of ULK2 significantly reversed miR-26b-mediated autophagy inhibition.
