However, the final dose-volume histogram (DVH) obtained by this technique differs from the optimal DVH, owing to optimization convergence errors. Herein, intermediate dose calculation was applied to IMRT plans during the optimization process to solve these issues.Homogeneous and heterogeneous targets were delineated on a virtual phantom, and the final DVH for the target volume was assessed on the target coverage. The IMRT plans of 30 patients were established to evaluate the usefulness of intermediate dose calculation.The target coverage results were analogous in the three plans with homogeneous targets. Conversely, conformity indices (conformity index [CI], heterogeneity index [HI], and uniformity index [UI]) of plans with intermediate dose calculation were estimated to be more homogenous than plans without this option for heterogeneous targets (CI, 0.371 vs. 1.000; HI, 0.104 vs. 0.036; UI, 1.099 vs. 1.031 for Phantom B; and CI, 0.318 vs. 0.956; HI, 0.167 vs. 0.076; UI, 1.165 vs. 1.057 for Phantom C). In brain and prostate cancers, a slight difference between plans calculated with anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) was observed (HI, p = 0.043, UI, p = 0.043 for brain; HI, p = 0.042, UI, p = 0.043 for prostate). All target coverage indices were improved by intermediate dose calculation in lung cancer cases (p = 0.043).In conclusion, intermediate dose calculation in IMRT plans improves the target coverage in the target volume around heterogeneous materials. Moreover, the optimization time can be reduced.""","""['Byung Do Park', 'Tae Gyu Kim', 'Jong Eon Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Impact of dose calculation accuracy during optimization on lung IMRT plan quality.', 'Evaluation of fixed-jaw IMRT and tangential partial-VMAT radiotherapy plans for synchronous bilateral breast cancer irradiation based on a dosimetric study.', 'Left breast irradiation with tangential intensity modulated radiotherapy (t-IMRT) versus tangential volumetric modulated arc therapy (t-VMAT): trade-offs between secondary cancer induction risk and optimal target coverage.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison in different dose calculation grid sizes between Acuros XB and anisotropic analytical algorithm for prostate VMAT.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.']"""

However, as the current literature on MSMB is inconsistent, we assessed the expression of MSMB at the protein and mRNA levels in a comprehensive set of different clinical stages of PC. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against MSMB was used to study protein expression in tissue specimens representing prostatectomies (n = 261) and in diagnostic needle biopsies from patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 100), and in locally recurrent castration-resistant PC (CRPC) (n = 105) and CRPC metastases (n = 113). The transcript levels of MSMB, nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4) and MSMB-NCOA4 fusion were examined by qRT-PCR in prostatectomy samples and by RNA-sequencing in benign prostatic hyperplasia, PC, and CRPC samples. We also measured serum MSMB levels and genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism rs10993994 using DNA from the blood of 369 PC patients and 903 controls. MSMB expression in PC (29% of prostatectomies and 21% of needle biopsies) was more frequent than in CRPC (9% of locally recurrent CRPCs and 9% of CRPC metastases) (p<0.0001). Detection of MSMB protein was inversely correlated with the Gleason score in prostatectomy specimens (p = 0.024). The read-through MSMB-NCOA4 transcript was detected at very low levels in PC. MSMB levels in serum were similar in cases of PC and controls but were significantly associated with PC risk when adjusted for age at diagnosis and levels of free or total PSA (p<0.001). Serum levels of MSMB in both PC patients and controls were significantly associated with the rs10993994 genotype (p<0.0001). In conclusion, decreased expression of MSMB parallels the clinical progression of PC and adjusted serum MSMB levels are associated with PC risk.""","""['Liisa Sjöblom', 'Outi Saramäki', 'Matti Annala', 'Katri Leinonen', 'Janika Nättinen', 'Teemu Tolonen', 'Tiina Wahlfors', 'Matti Nykter', 'G Steven Bova', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Hans Lilja', 'Tapio Visakorpi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Microseminoprotein-Beta Expression in Different Stages of Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigation of the relationship between prostate cancer and MSMB and NCOA4 genetic variants and protein expression.', 'Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on the expression of prostate cancer biomarkers MSMB and MSMB-binding protein CRISP3.', 'Prostate tumors downregulate microseminoprotein-beta (MSMB) in the surrounding benign prostate epithelium and this response is associated with tumor aggressiveness.', 'The potential value of microseminoprotein-beta as a prostate cancer biomarker and therapeutic target.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Patient-Derived Xenografts and Organoids Recapitulate Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Sustained Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Suggesting Tissue-Specific MSMB Gene Promoter as a Novel Approach for Prostate Targeted Gene Therapy.', 'miR-32 promotes MYC-driven prostate cancer.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.']"""

Despite the biological and clinical significance of SLC45A3-ELK4, its generating mechanism has not been elucidated. It was shown in one cell line that the binding of transcription factor CTCF to the insulators located at or near the gene boundaries, inversely correlates with the level of the chimera. To investigate the mechanism of such cis-SAGe events, we sequenced potential regions that may play a role in such transcriptional read-through. We could not detect mutations at the transcription termination site, insulator sites, splicing sites, or within CTCF itself in LNCaP cells, thus suggesting a ""soft-wired"" mechanism in regulating the cis-SAGe event. To investigate the role CTCF plays in regulating the chimeric RNA expression, we compared the levels of CTCF binding to the insulators in different cell lines, as well as clinical samples. Surprisingly, we did not find an inverse correlation between CTCF level, or its bindings to the insulators and SLC45A3-ELK4 expression among different samples. However, in three prostate cancer cell lines, different environmental factors can cause the expression levels of the chimeric RNA to change, and these changes do inversely correlate with CTCF level, and/or its bindings to the insulators. We thus conclude that CTCF and its bindings to the insulators are not the primary reasons for differential SLC45A3-ELK4 expression in different cell lines, or clinical cases. However, they are the likely mechanism for the same cells to respond to different environmental cues, in order to regulate the expression of SLC45A3-ELK4 chimeric RNA. This response to different environmental cues is not general to other cis-SAGe events, as we only found one out of 16 newly identified chimeric RNAs showing a pattern similar to SLC45A3-ELK4.""","""['Fujun Qin', 'Yansu Song', 'Yanmei Zhang', 'Loryn Facemire', 'Henry Frierson', 'Hui Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Chimeric transcript generated by cis-splicing of adjacent genes regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'SLC45A3-ELK4 functions as a long non-coding chimeric RNA.', 'SLC45A3-ELK4 chimera in prostate cancer: spotlight on cis-splicing.', 'CTCF: making the right connections.', 'Generation of Chimeric RNAs by cis-splicing of adjacent genes (cis-SAGe) in mammals.', 'The Landscape of Expressed Chimeric Transcripts in the Blood of Severe COVID-19 Infected Patients.', 'Chimeric RNA RRM2-C2orf48 plays an oncogenic role in the development of NNK-induced lung cancer.', 'Chimeric RNAs Discovered by RNA Sequencing and Their Roles in Cancer and Rare Genetic Diseases.', 'The Fusion of CLEC12A and MIR223HG Arises from a trans-Splicing Event in Normal and Transformed Human Cells.', 'Fusion Transcripts of Adjacent Genes: New Insights into the World of Human Complex Transcripts in Cancer.']"""

In this study we compared trends in relative cancer survival ratios in New Zealand and Australia between 2000-05 and 2006-10, using data from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare. Over this period, Australia showed significant improvements (6.0% in men, 3.0% in women) in overall 5-year cancer survival, with substantial increases in survival from major cancer sites such as lung, bowel, prostate, and breast cancers. New Zealand had only a 1.8% increase in cancer survival in men and 1.3% in women, with non-significant changes in survival from lung and bowel cancers, although there were increases in survival from prostate and breast cancers. For all cancers combined, and for lung and bowel cancer, the improvements in survival and the greater improvements in Australia were mainly in 1-year survival, suggesting factors related to diagnosis and presentation. For breast cancer, the improvements were similar in each country and seen in survival after the first year.

In this study, to explore the role of MYO6 in human glioma, lentivirus-delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MYO6 was designed to stably down-regulate its endogenous expression in glioblastoma cells U251. Knockdown of MYO6 signifi cantly inhibited viability and proliferation of U251 cells in vitro. Moreover, the cell cycle of U251 cells was arrested at G0/G1 phase with the absence of MYO6, which could contribute to the suppression of cell proliferation.

This study was undertaken to assess ErbB2 activity in abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer and to determine whether it may contribute to AR signaling in these tumors.  Experimental design:   AR activity and ErbB2 signaling were examined in the radical prostatectomy specimens from a neoadjuvant clinical trial of leuprolide plus abiraterone and in the specimens from abiraterone-resistant CRPC xenograft models. The effect of ErbB2 signaling on AR activity was determined in two CRPC cell lines. Moreover, the effect of combination treatment with abiraterone and an ErbB2 inhibitor was assessed in a CRPC xenograft model.  Results:   We found that ErbB2 signaling was elevated in residual tumor following abiraterone treatment in a subset of patients and was associated with higher nuclear AR expression. In xenograft models, we similarly demonstrated that ErbB2 signaling was increased and associated with AR reactivation in abiraterone-resistant tumors. Mechanistically, we show that ErbB2 signaling and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling stabilizes AR protein. Furthermore, concomitantly treating CRPC cells with abiraterone and an ErbB2 inhibitor, lapatinib, blocked AR reactivation and suppressed tumor progression.  Conclusions:   ErbB2 signaling is elevated in a subset of patients with abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer and stabilizes AR protein. Combination therapy with abiraterone and ErbB2 antagonists may be effective for treating the subset of CRPC with elevated ErbB2 activity.

Methods:   The authors selected four models from three classes of KBP approaches, corresponding to three distinct quantities that KBP models may predict: dose-volume histogram (DVH) points, DVH curves, and objective function weights. DVH point prediction is done using the best plan from a database of similar clinical plans; DVH curve prediction employs principal component analysis and multiple linear regression; and objective function weights uses either logistic regression or K-nearest neighbors. The authors trained each KBP model using training sets of sizes n = 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The authors set aside 100 randomly selected patients from their cohort of 315 prostate cancer patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Center to serve as a validation set for all experiments. For each value of n, the authors randomly selected 100 different training sets with replacement from the remaining 215 patients. Each of the 100 training sets was used to train a model for each value of n and for each KBT approach. To evaluate the models, the authors predicted the KBP endpoints for each of the 100 patients in the validation set. To estimate the minimum required sample size, the authors used statistical testing to determine if the median error for each sample size from 10 to 150 is equal to the median error for the maximum sample size of 200.  Results:   The minimum required sample size was different for each model. The DVH point prediction method predicts two dose metrics for the bladder and two for the rectum. The authors found that more than 200 samples were required to achieve consistent model predictions for all four metrics. For DVH curve prediction, the authors found that at least 75 samples were needed to accurately predict the bladder DVH, while only 20 samples were needed to predict the rectum DVH. Finally, for objective function weight prediction, at least 10 samples were needed to train the logistic regression model, while at least 150 samples were required to train the K-nearest neighbor methodology.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, the minimum required sample size needed to accurately train KBP models for prostate cancer depends on the specific model and endpoint to be predicted.

In a naïve implementation, the nth beam is selected by adding beam orientations one-by-one from a discrete set of candidates to an existing ensemble of (n - 1) beams. The best beam orientation is identified in a time consuming process by solving the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem for every candidate beam and selecting the beam that yields the largest improvement to the objective function value. This paper evaluates two alternative methods to accelerate iterative BAS based on surrogates for the FMO objective function value.  Methods:   We suggest to select candidate beams not based on the FMO objective function value after convergence but (1) based on the objective function value after five FMO iterations of a gradient based algorithm and (2) based on a projected gradient of the FMO problem in the first iteration. The performance of the objective function surrogates is evaluated based on the resulting objective function values and dose statistics in a treatment planning study comprising three intracranial, three pancreas, and three prostate cases. Furthermore, iterative BAS is evaluated for an application in which a small number of noncoplanar beams complement a set of coplanar beam orientations. This scenario is of practical interest as noncoplanar setups may require additional attention of the treatment personnel for every couch rotation.  Results:   Iterative BAS relying on objective function surrogates yields similar results compared to naïve BAS with regard to the objective function values and dose statistics. At the same time, early stopping of the FMO and using the projected gradient during the first iteration enable reductions in computation time by approximately one to two orders of magnitude. With regard to the clinical delivery of noncoplanar IMRT treatments, we could show that optimized beam ensembles using only a few noncoplanar beam orientations often approach the plan quality of fully noncoplanar ensembles.

Challenges to accurate correlation include matching the pathology sectioning plane with the in vivo imaging slice plane and correction for the deformation that occurs between in vivo imaging and histology. A methodology is presented for matching of the histological sectioning angle and position to the in vivo imaging slices.  Methods:   Patients (n = 4) with biochemical failure following external beam radiotherapy underwent diagnostic MRI to confirm localized recurrence of prostate cancer, followed by salvage radical prostatectomy. High-resolution 3-D MRI of the ex vivo specimens was acquired to determine the pathology sectioning angle that best matched the in vivo imaging slice plane, using matching anatomical features and implanted fiducials. A novel sectioning device was developed to guide sectioning at the correct angle, and to assist the insertion of reference dye marks to aid in histopathology reconstruction.  Results:   The percentage difference in the positioning of the urethra in the ex vivo pathology sections compared to the positioning in in vivo images was reduced from 34% to 7% through slicing at the best match angle. Reference dye marks were generated, which were visible in ex vivo imaging, in the tissue sections before and after processing, and in histology sections.  Conclusions:   The method achieved an almost fivefold reduction in the slice-matching error and is readily implementable in combination with standard MRI technology. The technique will be employed to generate datasets for correlation of whole-specimen prostate histopathology with in vivo diagnostic MRI using 3-D deformable registration, allowing assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of MRI parameters for prostate cancer.

The proliferative and apoptotic rates of the U266 MM cell line were assessed using MTT and flow‑cytometric assays, respectively.

The results revealed that silybin restrained the proliferation and enhanced the apoptosis of U266 cells. Furthermore, silybin inhibited the protein expression of PI3K, p‑Akt and p‑mTOR in U266 cells. Of note, inhibition of PI3K facilitated silybin‑mediated reduction of mTOR activation, cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in U266 cells, while activation of PI3K attenuated the effects of silybin.

Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of death, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), were estimated using Fine and Gray's regression model.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11.6years, 244 (34.1%) deaths occurred, 77 (31.6%) due to PCa. Excess mortality from all causes was reported in PCa patients with DM (HR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.03-2.36), which increased to 1.76 (95% CI: 0.99-3.13) when at least two out of three metabolic disorders (i.e., waist circumference ≥102cm, drug-treated hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia) were additionally present. The impact of metabolic disorders was stronger on non-PCa-specific mortality with HRs equal to 2.21 (95% CI: 1.38-3.54) for DM, 1.45 (95% CI: 0.97-2.19) for waist circumference ≥102cm, and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.19-2.22) for drug-treated hypertension.  Conclusions:   DM and other metabolic disorders unfavorably affected the survival of PCa patients, mainly impacting on the risk of death from causes other than PCa.""","""['Jerry Polesel', 'Andrea Gini', 'Luigino Dal Maso', 'Carmen Stocco', 'Silvia Birri', 'Martina Taborelli', 'Diego Serraino', 'Antonella Zucchetto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Diabetes Complications""","""['Dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer survival.', 'Waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, body mass index, and prostate cancer risk: results from the North-American case-control study Prostate Cancer & Environment Study.', 'Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy use and the risk of death in men with prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy who have no or at least a single risk factor for coronary artery disease.', 'The Impact of Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on Prostate Cancer.', 'MALAT1 Fusions and Basal Cells Contribute to Primary Resistance against Androgen Receptor Inhibition in TRAMP Mice.', 'Obesity as a Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer Mortality: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of 280,199 Patients.', 'Diet and lifestyle considerations for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Diabetes mellitus predicts inferior survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a propensity score-matched analysis.', 'The putative tumour suppressor miR-1-3p modulates prostate cancer cell aggressiveness by repressing E2F5 and PFTK1.']"""

We found that different adverse pathologic outcomes and biochemical outcomes were shown according to biopsy pattern although the patients have the same pathologic Gleason score (pGS) 3+4 after RP.  Background:   To identify the biochemical recurrence rate (BCR) according to a pGS upgrade after radical prostatectomy among men with prostate cancer who are clinical candidates for active surveillance (AS) according to the Royal Marsden Hospital criteria.  Methods:   Of the 956 patients with prostate cancer who met the Royal Marsden Hospital criteria for AS underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2006 and June 2014, we enrolled the 830 patients whose pGS was ≤ 3+4 in analysis. We stratified the patients into 3 groups according to the disparity between the bGS and pGS, as follows: group A (n = 211): bGS 3+3 to pGS 3+3; group B (n = 430): bGS 3+3 to pGS 3+4; group C (n = 189): bGS 3+4 to pGS 3+4.  Results:   The patients in group C had a higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, a higher percentage of positive cores, maximum core involvement (P < .001), and higher postoperative levels of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and positive surgical margins compared with the patients in groups A and B (P < .001, P = .002, and P < .001, for patients in groups C, B, and A, respectively). Group C had a significantly lower BCR-free survival rate compared with groups A and B via Kaplan-Meier, and no difference was observed in the BCR between groups A and B (log rank, P = .475).

For each National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, TTT (defined as the time between initial positive prostate biopsy and start of RT) was analyzed in 4 intervals: < 3, 3-6, 6-9, and 9-24 months. We recorded the use of androgen deprivation therapy among patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease.  Results:   The median TTT was 3.3 months (range, 0.6-23.5 months), and it was similar for each risk group (range, 3.3-3.4 months). The median follow up was 64 months.

We hypothesized that the utilization of open and robotic prostatectomy as well as lymph node dissection changed dynamically over the last 10 years.  Methods:   A total of 6-month case log data of certifying urologists from 2003 to 2013 were obtained for the American Board of Urology. Cases were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes for open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with a corresponding diagnosis of prostate cancer as defined by ICD-9 code 185.0.  Results obtained:   A total of 6,563 urologists submitted case logs, of which 68% (4,470/6,563) reported performing at least one radical prostatectomy (RP), totaling 46,030 RPs logged. There was a 376% increase in the performance of RALP over the study period with robotic volume increasing from 22% of all RP in 2003 to 85% in 2013. Among surgeons performing ORP, the median number performed was 2; of surgeons who performed RALP, the median number performed was 8 (P<0.001). Overall, 39% of surgeons logging ORP performed 2 or fewer RP, whereas 19% of surgeons who performed RALP performed 2 or less RP (P<0.001). The highest volume robotic surgeons (top 10% surgical volume) performed 41% of all RALP with the highest performing robotic surgeon recording 658 prostatectomies over 6 months. Oncologists represented 4.1% of all surgeons performing RP and performed 15.1% of all RP (P<0.001); general urologists performed the majority of RP (57.8%). When performed open, there was no influence of surgeon specialty on the performance of lymph node dissection (LND); if performed robotically, oncologists were significantly more likely to perform LND compared with general surgeons (47% vs. 25.9%, respectively, P<0.001).  Conclusions:   Robotic prostatectomies are performed 5 times more commonly than open prostatectomy and represent 85% of all RP performed by board-certified urologists in 2013. Compared to RALP, ORP are significantly more likely to be performed by lower volume surgeons.

This novel bead-based procedure encompasses a first antigen capture, labeling of captured protein targets on magnetic particles, combinatorial target elution and a read-out by a secondary capture bead array. We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept setting that target detection via two sequential affinity interactions reduced off-target contribution, while lowered background and noise levels, improved correlation to clinical values compared to single binder assays. We also compared sensitivity levels with single binder and classical sandwich assays, explored the possibility for DNA-based signal amplification, and demonstrate the applicability of the dual capture bead-based antibody microarray for biomarker analysis.

However, its association with other cellular events, and in particular, cell death, remain unknown. To examine the function of such fusion genes, an expression plasmid containing the TMPRSS2:ERG (T1/E5) sequence (ΔERG) from a patient sample was constructed and transiently transfected into DU145 cells, which do not express the fusion gene. It was found that the overexpression of ΔERG significantly inhibited the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis in DU145 cells. By contrast, VCaP cells, which do contain TMPRSS2:ERG, were sensitized to cisplatin‑induced apoptosis through siRNA inhibition of the fusion gene. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, a stable cell line expressing the ΔERG gene was constructed. Expression of ΔERG did not affect cell migration, but did protect cells from DNA damage and apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Furthermore, knockdown of ΔERG by short interfering RNA resulted in cells regaining their sensitivity to cisplatin. Finally, the gene coding for activating transcription factor 5, which is important for cell survival, may be upregulated by ΔERG. Taken together, these data point to a new function of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in regulating the apoptotic pathway.""","""['Junqi Wu', 'Linfeng Chi', 'Zhanghui Chen', 'Xianghong Lu', 'Suping Xiao', 'Guanglin Zhang', 'Jindan Luo', 'Ge-Ming Chen', 'Jun Yang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'Antineoplastic Effects of siRNA against TMPRSS2-ERG Junction Oncogene in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of novel TMPRSS2:ERG mechanisms in prostate cancer metastasis: involvement of MMP9 and PLXNA2.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients who underwent mpMRI at our hospital, and who had their first prostate biopsy between July 2010 and April 2014, were analysed retrospectively. The prostate biopsies were taken transperineally under transrectal ultrasonography guidance. In all, 14 cores were biopsied as a systematic biopsy in all patients. Two cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy cores were added for each lesion in patients who had suspicious or equivocal lesions on mpMRI. The PI-RADS scoring system version 2.0 (PI-RADS v2) was used to describe the MRI findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine significant predictors of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.  Results:   In all, 288 patients were analysed. The median patient age, PSA level, prostate volume and PSA density were 69 years, 7.5 ng/mL, 28.7 mL, and 0.26 ng/mL/mL, respectively. The biopsy results were benign, clinically insignificant, and clinically significant prostate cancer in 129 (45%), 18 (6%) and 141 (49%) patients, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that PI-RADS v2 score and PSA density were independent predictors for prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer. When PI-RADS v2 score and PSA density were combined, a PI-RADS v2 score of ≥4 and PSA density ≥0.15 ng/mL/mL, or PI-RADS v2 score of 3 and PSA density of ≥0.30 ng/mL/mL, was associated with the highest clinically significant prostate cancer detection rates (76-97%) on the first biopsy. Of the patients in this group with negative biopsy results, 22% were subsequently diagnosed as prostate cancer. In contrast, a PI-RADS v2 score of ≤3 and PSA density of <0.15 ng/mL/mL yielded no clinically significant prostate cancer and no additional detection of prostate cancer on further biopsies.  Conclusions:   A combination of PI-RADS v2 score and PSA density can help in the decision-making process before prostate biopsy and in the follow-up strategy in biopsy naïve patients.

This study aimed to detect the prevalence, consequences and characteristics associated with high FCR in PCa survivors. Material and methods This cross-sectional study included patients diagnosed with localized PCa and treated with curative radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2012. We administered the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) to assess FCR severity (primary outcome measure). Secondary outcomes included distress, quality of life (QOL), post-traumatic symptoms, and multidimensional aspects of FCR. χ(2)-tests, t-tests and Pearson's correlations examined the relationship between FCR and medical/demographic characteristics. MANOVA analyses and χ2-tests identified differences between PCa survivors with high and low FCR. Results Two hundred eighty-three PCa survivors (median age of 70.0 years) completed the questionnaires a median time of 7.1 years after surgery. About a third (36%) of all PCa survivors experienced high FCR. High FCR was associated with lower QOL, more physical problems, higher distress and more post-traumatic stress symptoms. PCa survivors with high FCR reported disease-related triggers (especially medical examinations), felt helpless and experienced problems in social relationships. High FCR was associated with a younger age and having received adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusions Results illustrate that FCR is a significant problem in PCa survivors. Younger men and those treated with adjuvant radiotherapy are especially at risk. Those with high FCR experience worse QOL and higher symptom burden.

However, its potential role in the prostate cancer metastatic process has not yet been elucidated. Thus, we investigated the inhibition effect of tetrandrine on prostate cancer migration and invasion and the corresponding molecular basis underlying its anticancer activity. Cell migration and invasion were determined using the Transwell chamber model. The protein expression of Akt, phosphorylated Akt, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphorylated mTOR and matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) was detected by western blot in the presence or absence of tetrandrine or in the group tetrandrine combination with LY294002 (inhibitor of Akt) and rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR). Our studies showed that excluding the effect of tetrandrine on cell proliferation, tetrandrine significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, tetrandrine decreased the protein levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR, and MMP-9. While the inhibition of Akt or mTOR by the respective inhibitors could potentiate this effect of tetrandrine on prostate cancer cells, the studies indicate that tetrandrine inhibits the metastasis process by negatively regulating the Akt/mTOR/MMP-9 signaling pathway. These results suggest that tetrandrine might serve as a potential metastasis suppressor to treat cancer cells that have escaped surgical removal or that have disseminated widely.""","""['Bo Kou', 'Wei Liu', 'Wenbo He', 'Yuanyuan Zhang', 'Jianjie Zheng', 'Yang Yan', 'Yongjian Zhang', 'Suochun Xu', 'Haichen Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Shikonin inhibits prostate cancer cells metastasis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression via AKT/mTOR and ROS/ERK1/2 pathways.', 'Tetrandrine suppresses proliferation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits migration and invasion in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Tetrandrine inhibits migration and invasion of human renal cell carcinoma by regulating Akt/NF-κB/MMP-9 signaling.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tetrandrine, a Chinese plant-derived alkaloid, is a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy.', 'Sonicated Extract from the Aril of Momordica Cochinchinensis Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Migration in Aggressive Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Progress on structural modification of Tetrandrine with wide range of pharmacological activities.', 'Targeting the two-pore channel 2 in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Growth-Suppressive and Apoptosis-Inducing Effects of Tetrandrine in SW872 Human Malignant Liposarcoma Cells via Activation of Caspase-9, Down-Regulation of XIAP and STAT-3, and ER Stress.', 'Tetrandrine Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in IL-6-Induced HCT116 Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 105 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) histopathologically proven using a combination of fusion Pbx and systematic PBx, who underwent RP, were investigated. All patients had been examined using mpMRI, applying the European Society of Urogenital Radiology criteria. Histological findings from the RP specimen were compared with those from the PBx. Whole-mount RP specimen and mpMRI results were directly compared by a uro-pathologist and a uro-radiologist in step-section analysis.  Results:   In the 105 patients with histopathologically proven PCa by combination of fusion PBx and systematic PBx, the detection rate of PCa was 90% (94/105) in fusion PBx alone and 68% (72/105) in systematic PBx alone (P = 0.001). The combination PBx detected 23 (22%) Gleason score (GS) 6, 69 (66%) GS 7 and 13 (12%) GS ≥8 tumours. Fusion PBx alone detected 25 (26%) GS 6, 57 (61%) GS 7 and 12 (13%) GS ≥8 tumours. Systematic PBx alone detected 17 (24%) GS 6, 49 (68%) GS 7 and 6 (8%) GS ≥8 tumours. Fusion PBx alone would have missed 11 tumours (4% [4/105] of GS 6, 6% [6/105] of GS 7 and 1% [1/105] of GS ≥8 tumours). Systematic PBx alone would have missed 33 tumours (10% [10/105] of GS 6, 20% [21/105] of GS 7 and 2% [2/105] of GS ≥8 tumours). The rates of concordance with regard to GS between the PBx and RP specimen were 63% (n = 65), 54% (n = 56) and 75% (n = 78) in fusion, systematic and combination PBx (fusion and systematic PBx combined), respectively. Upgrading of the GS between PBx and RP specimen occurred in 33% (n = 34), 44% (n = 46) and 18% (n = 19) in fusion, systematic and combination PBx, respectively. γ-correlation for detection of any cancer was 0.76 for combination PBx, 0.68 for fusion PBx alone and 0.23 for systematic PBx alone. In all, 84% (n = 88) of index tumours were identified by mpMRI; 86% (n = 91) of index lesions on the mpMRI were proven in the RP specimen.  Conclusions:   Fusion PBx of tumour-suspicious lesions on mpMRI was associated with a higher detection rate of more aggressive PCa and a better tumour prediction in final histopathology than systematic PBx alone; however, combination PBx had the best concordance for the prediction of GS. Furthermore, the additional findings of systematic PBx reflect the multifocality of PCa, therefore, the combination of both biopsy methods would still represent the best approach for the prediction of the final tumour grading in PCa.""","""['Angelika Borkowetz', 'Ivan Platzek', 'Marieta Toma', 'Theresa Renner', 'Roman Herout', 'Martin Baunacke', 'Michael Laniado', 'Gustavo Baretton', 'Michael Froehner', 'Stefan Zastrow', 'Manfred Wirth']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Role of systematic biopsy in the era of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Gleason 6 prostate cancer in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Evaluation of Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound-Fusion Biopsy Compared to Transrectal Systematic Biopsy in the Prediction of Tumour Aggressiveness in Patients with Previously Negative Biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'A comprehensive comparison between mpMRI of the prostate, MR-US fusion biopsy and whole mount histopathology.', 'Pathological Accuracy in Prostate Cancer: Single-Center Outcomes of 3 Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy Techniques and Random Systematic Biopsy.', 'A second opinion pathology review improves the diagnostic concordance between prostate cancer biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Combined Systematic and MRI-US Fusion Prostate Biopsy Has the Highest Grading Accuracy When Compared to Final Pathology.', 'Correlation of MRI-Lesion Targeted Biopsy vs. Systematic Biopsy Gleason Score with Final Pathological Gleason Score after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The commercially available pyrosequencing systems can harbor two different types of software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively, both widely employed for DNA methylation analysis.  Objective:   Aim of the study was to assess the performance for DNA methylation analysis at CpG sites of the two pyrosequencing software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively. Despite CpG mode having been specifically generated for CpG methylation quantification, many investigations on this topic have been carried out with AQ mode. As proof of equivalent performance of the two software for this type of analysis is not available, the focus of this paper was to evaluate if the two modes currently used for CpG methylation assessment by pyrosequencing may give overlapping results.  Methods:   We compared the performance of the two software in quantifying DNA methylation in the promoter of selected genes (GSTP1, MGMT, LINE-1) by testing two case series which include DNA from paraffin embedded prostate cancer tissues (PC study, N = 36) and DNA from blood fractions of healthy people (DD study, N = 28), respectively.  Results:   We found discrepancy in the two pyrosequencing software-based quality assignment of DNA methylation assays. Compared to the software for analysis in the AQ mode, less permissive criteria are supported by the Pyro Q-CpG software, which enables analysis in CpG mode. CpG mode warns the operators about potential unsatisfactory performance of the assay and ensures a more accurate quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation at CpG sites.  Conclusion:   The implementation of CpG mode is strongly advisable in order to improve the reliability of the methylation analysis results achievable by pyrosequencing.""","""['Chiara Grasso', 'Morena Trevisan', 'Valentina Fiano', 'Valentina Tarallo', 'Laura De Marco', 'Carlotta Sacerdote', 'Lorenzo Richiardi', 'Franco Merletti', 'Anna Gillio-Tos']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Detection of MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma using pyrosequencing.', 'Detection of MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma using pyrosequencing.', 'Quantitative DNA Methylation Analysis at Single-Nucleotide Resolution by Pyrosequencing®.', ""The prognostic value of MGMT promoter status by pyrosequencing assay for glioblastoma patients' survival: a meta-analysis."", 'Strategy for studying gene methylation: the example of MGMT.', 'Assessment of viral methylation levels for high risk HPV types by newly designed consensus primers PCR and pyrosequencing.']"""

As a key enzyme for FA synthesis fatty acid synthase (FASN) is often overexpressed in human prostate cancers and its expression correlates with worse prognosis and poor survival. P300 is an acetyltransferase that acts as a transcription co-activator. Increasing evidence suggests that P300 is a major PCa promoter, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that P300 binds to and increases histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) in the FASN gene promoter. We provided evidence that P300 transcriptionally upregulates FASN expression and promotes lipid accumulation in human PCa cells in culture and Pten knockout prostate tumors in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of P300 decreased FASN expression and lipid droplet accumulation in PCa cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that expression of P300 protein positively correlates with FASN protein levels in a cohort of human PCa specimens. We further showed that FASN is a key mediator of P300-induced growth of PCa cells in culture and in mice. Together, our findings demonstrate P300 as a key factor that regulates FASN expression, lipid accumulation and cell growth in PCa. They also suggest that this regulatory pathway can serve as a new therapeutic target for PCa treatment.""","""['Xiaokun Gang', 'Yinhui Yang', 'Jian Zhong', 'Kui Jiang', 'Yunqian Pan', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Jun Zhang', 'Wanhai Xu', 'Guixia Wang', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Speckle-type POZ protein suppresses lipid accumulation and prostate cancer growth by stabilizing fatty acid synthase.', 'FASN multi-omic characterization reveals metabolic heterogeneity in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Fatty acid synthase and AKT pathway signaling in a subset of papillary thyroid cancers.', 'Molecular mechanisms of fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated resistance to anti-cancer treatments.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase in breast and endometrial cancer: An alternative to selective estrogen receptor modulators?', 'Overexpression of miR-17-5p may negatively impact p300/CBP factor-associated inflammation in a hypercholesterolemic advanced prostate cancer model.', 'High levels of histone H3 K27 acetylation and tri-methylation are associated with shorter survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.', 'Network models of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination connect metabolic and cell signaling pathways in lung cancer.', 'Effects of the Acetyltransferase p300 on Tumour Regulation from the Novel Perspective of Posttranslational Protein Modification.', 'Lipid metabolism in tumor microenvironment: novel therapeutic targets.']"""

In this study, we looked for possible association of alterations in CAPERα with microvessel density in HCC.  Methods:   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant CAPERα as antigen were used to detect antibody against CAPERα. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on liver sections was performed to analyze expression profiles of CAPERα, VEGF and CD34 in HCC and control tissues and was further used to assess the correlation of expression among CAPERα, VEGF and CD34 in HCC development.  Results:   Autoantibody to CAPERα was highest in HCC (22/76, 28.9%), not detected in prostate cancer (0/79) and at 3.4% (3/88) in breast cancer. In immunohistochemical analysis of grades II and III HCC tissues, significantly decreased immunostaining for CAPERα was observed and this correlated directly with decreased immunostaining for VEGF (R=0.534, P=0.0003). Using CD34 immunostaining for detecting newly formed microvessels, strong staining was observed in grades II and III HCC. Normal liver sections, all of which have high expression of CAPERα were totally negative for CD34 immunostaining. A significant inverse correlation was seen between CAPERα and CD34 immunostaining (R=-0.481, P=0.0012).

Furthermore, SKi or ABC294640 or fenretinide increase the expression of the senescence markers, p53 and p21 in LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells. The siRNA knockdown of SK1 or SK2 failed to increase p53 and p21 expression, but the former did reduce DNA synthesis in LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells. Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (reactive oxygen species scavenger) blocked the SK inhibitor-induced increase in p21 and p53 expression but had no effect on the proteasomal degradation of SK1a. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Des1 increased p53 expression while a combination of Des1/SK1 siRNA increased the expression of p21. Therefore, Des1 and SK1 participate in regulating LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cell growth and this involves p53/p21-dependent and -independent pathways.

A means of molecularly defining such myofibroblasts is unknown. We compared protein profiles of normal and diseased stroma isolated from prostate cancer patients to identify discriminating hallmarks of disease-associated stroma. We included the stimulation of normal stromal cells with known myofibroblast inducers namely soluble TGFβ and exosome-associated-TGFβ and compared the function and protein profiles arising. In all 6-patients examined, diseased stroma exhibited a pro-angiogenic influence on endothelial cells, generating large multicellular vessel-like structures. Identical structures were apparent following stimulation of normal stroma with exosomes (5/6 patients), but TGFβ-stimulation generated a non-angiogenic stroma. Proteomics highlighted disease-related cytoskeleton alterations such as elevated Transgelin (TAGLN). Many of these were also changed following TGFβ or exosome stimulation and did not well discriminate the nature of the stimulus. Soluble TGFβ, however triggered differential expression of proteins related to mitochondrial function including voltage dependent ion channels VDAC1 and 2, and this was not found in the other stromal types studied. Surprisingly, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1), a stem-cell associated protein was detected in normal stromal cells and found to decrease in disease.

The oncogenic PIM kinases have been shown to support cancer cell survival and motility, but the PIM-regulated pathways stimulating cell migration and invasion are less well characterized than those affecting cell survival. Here we have identified the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3B) and the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor as direct PIM targets, whose tumour-suppressive effects in prostate cancer cells are inhibited by PIM-induced phosphorylation, resulting in increased cell migration. Targeting GSK3B is also essential for the observed PIM-enhanced expression of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is an important regulator of both cell migration and adhesion. Accordingly, selective inhibition of PIM activity not only reduces cell migration, but also affects integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, these data provide novel mechanistic insights on how and why patients with metastatic prostate cancer may benefit from therapies targeting PIM kinases, and how such approaches may also be applicable to inflammatory conditions.""","""['Niina M Santio', 'Maria Salmela', 'Heidi Arola', 'Sini K Eerola', 'Jyrki Heino', 'Eeva-Marja Rainio', 'Päivi J Koskinen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Phosphorylation of NFATC1 at PIM1 target sites is essential for its ability to promote prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Pim Kinases Promote Migration and Metastatic Growth of Prostate Cancer Xenografts.', 'PIM1 accelerates prostate cancer cell motility by phosphorylating actin capping proteins.', 'PIM kinases: From survival factors to regulators of cell motility.', 'The oncogenic PIM kinase family regulates drug resistance through multiple mechanisms.', 'Inhibition of PIM Kinases Promotes Neuroblastoma Cell Differentiation to a Neuronal Phenotype.', 'PIM3-AMPK-HDAC4/5 axis restricts MuERVL-marked 2-cell-like state in embryonic stem cells.', 'The Role of PIM Kinases in Pediatric Solid Tumors.', 'A systematic review on active sites and functions of PIM-1 protein.', 'PP2A-activating Drugs Enhance FLT3 Inhibitor Efficacy through AKT Inhibition-Dependent GSK-3β-Mediated c-Myc and Pim-1 Proteasomal Degradation.']"""

Expression of CT and CTR is frequently elevated in prostate cancers (PCs) and activation of CT-CTR axis in non-invasive PC cells induces an invasive phenotype. Here we show by yeast-two hybrid screens that CTR associates with the tight junction protein Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) via the interaction between the type 1 PDZ motif at the carboxy-terminus of CTR and the PDZ3 domain of ZO-1. Mutation of either the CTR C-PDZ-binding motif or the ZO-1-PDZ3 domain did not affect binding of CTR with its ligand or G-protein-mediated signaling but abrogated destabilizing actions of CT on tight junctions and formation of distant metastases by orthotopically implanted PC cells in nude mice, indicating that these PDZ domain interactions were pathologically relevant. Further, we observed CTR-ZO-1 interactions in PC specimens by proximity ligation immunohistochemistry, and identified that the number of interactions in metastatic PC specimens was several-fold larger than in non-metastatic PC. Our results for the first time demonstrate a mechanism by which PDZ-mediated interaction between CTR and ZO1 is required for CT-stimulated metastasis of prostate cancer. Since many receptors contain PDZ-binding motifs, this would suggest that PDZ-binding motif-adaptor protein interactions constitute a common mechanism for cancer metastasis.""","""['Ahmed Aljameeli', 'Arvind Thakkar', 'Shibu Thomas', 'Vijaybasker Lakshmikanthan', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Girish V Shah']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Calcitonin receptor increases invasion of prostate cancer cells by recruiting zonula occludens-1 and promoting PKA-mediated TJ disassembly.', 'Calcitonin induces stem cell-like phenotype in prostate cancer cells.', 'A-kinase anchoring protein 2 is required for calcitonin-mediated invasion of cancer cells.', 'Epithelial junctions and Rho family GTPases: the zonular signalosome.', 'Deletions of genes encoding calcitonin/alpha-CGRP, amylin and calcitonin receptor have given new and unexpected insights into the function of calcitonin receptors and calcitonin receptor-like receptors in bone.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-1297 participates in the repair of intestinal barrier injury in patients with HIV/AIDS via negative regulation of PLCβ1.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Calcitonin receptor is required for T-antigen-induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Expression and activity of the calcitonin receptor family in a sample of primary human high-grade gliomas.']"""

Although eight distinct PI3K isoforms exist, grouped into three classes, most of the evidence currently available are focused on one specific isoform with very little known about the potential role of the other members of this family in cancer. Here we demonstrate that the class II enzyme PI3K-C2β is overexpressed in several human breast cancer cell lines and in human breast cancer specimens. Our data indicate that PI3K-C2β regulates breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and that PI3K-C2β expression in breast tissues is correlated with the proliferative status of the tumor. Specifically we show that downregulation of PI3K-C2β in breast cancer cell lines reduces colony formation, induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits tumor growth, in particular in an estrogen-dependent in vivo xenograft. Investigation of the mechanism of the PI3K-C2β-dependent regulation of cell cycle progression and cell growth revealed that PI3K-C2β regulates cyclin B1 protein levels through modulation of microRNA miR-449a levels. Our data further demonstrate that downregulation of PI3K-C2β inhibits breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Consistent with this, PI3K-C2β is highly expressed in lymph-nodes metastases compared to matching primary tumors. These data demonstrate that PI3K-C2β plays a pivotal role in breast cancer progression and in metastasis development. Our data indicate that PI3K-C2β may represent a key molecular switch that regulates a rate-limiting step in breast tumor progression and therefore it may be targeted to limit breast cancer spread.""","""['Anissa Chikh', 'Riccardo Ferro', 'Jonathan J Abbott', 'Roberto Piñeiro', 'Richard Buus', 'Manuela Iezzi', 'Francesca Ricci', 'Daniele Bergamaschi', 'Paola Ostano', 'Giovanna Chiorino', 'Rossano Lattanzio', 'Massimo Broggini', 'Mauro Piantelli', 'Tania Maffucci', 'Marco Falasca']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Downregulation of class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K-C2β delays cell division and potentiates the effect of docetaxel on cancer cell growth.', 'Novel roles for class II Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase C2β in signalling pathways involved in prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Inactivation of the Class II PI3K-C2β Potentiates Insulin Signaling and Sensitivity.', 'Class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoforms in vesicular trafficking.', 'Class II PI3K Functions in Cell Biology and Disease.', 'Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of trans-Chalcone: Modulation of MicroRNAs Linked to Breast Cancer Progression in MCF-7 Cells.', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR Dysregulation and Reprogramming Metabolic Pathways in Renal Cancer: Crosstalk with the VHL/HIF Axis.', 'Targeting Class I-II-III PI3Ks in Cancer Therapy: Recent Advances in Tumor Biology and Preclinical Research.', 'Phosphoinositide species and filamentous actin formation mediate engulfment by senescent tumor cells.', 'An Overview of Class II Phosphoinositide 3-Kinases.']"""

Methods:   Data on lifetime agricultural exposures (type of crops, livestock and tasks including pesticide use, re-entry and harvesting) were collected from the enrolment questionnaire. During the period from enrolment (2005-2007) to 31 December 2009, 1672 incident prostate cancers were identified. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression analysis.  Results:   We found an increased risk for cattle breeders using insecticides [HR 1.20, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01-1.42] with a significant dose-response relationship with number of cattle treated (P for trend 0.01). A dose-response relationship was also observed with the number of hogs (P for trend 0.06). We found an excess of prostate cancer risk among people involved in grassland activities, mainly in haymaking (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36). Pesticide use and harvesting among fruit growers were associated with an elevated prostate cancer risk, with a two-fold increased risk for the largest area. For potato and tobacco producers, an elevated prostate cancer risk was observed for almost all tasks, suggesting a link with pesticide exposure since all of them potentially involved pesticide exposure.

Using the drug repositioning strategy, we developed a cell-based multi-parameter primary screening assay to identify drugs that inhibit the migratory and invasive properties of metastatic PC-3 PCa cells. Following the completion of the primary screening assay, 33 drugs were identified from an FDA approved drug library that either inhibited migration or were cytotoxic to the PC-3 cells. Based on the data obtained from the subsequent validation studies, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, simvastatin, fluvastatin and vandetanib were identified as strong candidates that can inhibit both the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells without significantly affecting cell viability.

At baseline (1986), subjects completed a questionnaire on dietary habits and other risk factors for cancer and were classified into vegetarians (n=691), pescetarians (n=389), 1 day per week (n=1388), 2-5 days per week (n=2965) and 6-7 days per week meat consumers (n=5649).  Results:   After 20.3 years of follow-up, 279 lung, 312 postmenopausal breast and 399 prostate cancer cases (including 136 advanced) were available for analyses. After adjustment for confounding variables, we found no statistically significant association between meat consumption groups and the risk of lung cancer. As well, no significant associations were observed for postmenopausal breast and overall prostate cancer. After adjustment for confounders, individuals consuming meat 1 day per week were at a 75% increased risk of advanced prostate cancer compared with 6-7 days per week meat consumers (95%CI 1.03-2.97).  Conclusions:   Vegetarians, pescetarians and 1 day per week meat consumers did not have a reduced risk of lung, postmenopausal breast and overall prostate cancer compared with individuals consuming meat on a daily basis after taking confounders into account.""","""['A M J Gilsing', 'M P Weijenberg', 'R A Goldbohm', 'P C Dagnelie', 'P A van den Brandt', 'L J Schouten']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Clin Nutr""","""['Vegetarianism, low meat consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer in a population based cohort study.', 'The Netherlands Cohort Study−Meat Investigation Cohort; a population-based cohort over-represented with vegetarians, pescetarians and low meat consumers.', 'A prospective study of vegetarianism and isoflavone intake in relation to breast cancer risk in British women.', 'Vegetarianism and breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk: an overview and meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Nutrition and health--potential health benefits and risks of vegetarianism and limited consumption of meat in the Netherlands.', 'Lung Cancer Risk in Men and Compliance with the 2018 WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations.', 'Health effects associated with consumption of unprocessed red meat: a Burden of Proof study.', 'Systematic review of the impact of a plant-based diet on prostate cancer incidence and outcomes.', 'Association of meat, vegetarian, pescatarian and fish-poultry diets with risk of 19 cancer sites and all cancer: findings from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study and meta-analysis.', 'Risk of cancer in regular and low meat-eaters, fish-eaters, and vegetarians: a prospective analysis of UK Biobank participants.']"""

Caregivers of patients undergoing radiation oncology may represent a promising outreach target for disseminating and clarifying screening information. We aimed to: (1) determine the incidence of cancer screening in this cohort, and (2) identify barriers to and deficiencies in screening.  Methods:   We distributed a 21-item survey on cancer screening history and related concerns to caregivers ≥ 18 years old at one urban and two suburban radiation oncology centers. Reported screening habits were compared with American Cancer Society/American Urological Association guidelines for breast, cervical, colon, and prostate cancer. Statistical analysis included Pearson χ(2) tests.  Results:   A total of 209 caregivers (median age, 55.5 years; 146 women) were surveyed. Although 92% had primary care physicians (PCPs), only 58% reported being informed about recommended screening intervals. Participants ≤ 49 years old were less likely to report PCP discussion of cancer screening than older participants (41% and 66%, respectively; P = .006). Ninety-eight respondents (47%) had one or more screening concern(s). Among screening-eligible caregivers, 23 (18%) reported not undergoing regular colonoscopies. Fourteen women (13%) did not have Papanicolaou smears at recommended intervals, and 21 (18%) did not have annual mammograms. Six men (21%) did not undergo annual prostate screening. Decreased recommended screening with colonoscopy and mammography correlated with younger age.  Conclusion:   This survey of relatively unexplored caregivers identified cancer screening deficiencies and concerns that might be addressed by targeted interventions.

Bioinformatic analysis was also performed to uncover the pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism.  Results:   Fish oil, not oleic acid, suppresses prostate cancer cell viability. Assessment of fatty acid synthesis pathway activity also shows that oleic acid is a more potent inhibitor than fish oil on de novo fatty acid synthesis. Although fatty acid synthase activity decreases with fish oil treatment, the inhibition of its activity occurs over time while reduction in viability occurs within 24 h.

Consequently, results on adverse events are an integral part of reimbursement dossiers submitted by pharmaceutical companies to health policy decision-makers. Methods applied in the analysis of adverse events commonly include simple standard methods for contingency tables. However, the results produced may be misleading if observations are censored at the time of discontinuation due to treatment switching or noncompliance, resulting in unequal follow-up periods. In this paper, we present examples to show that the application of inadequate methods for the analysis of adverse events in the reimbursement dossier can lead to a downgrading of the evidence on a drug's benefit in the subsequent assessment, as greater harm from the drug cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty. Legal regulations on the benefit assessment of drugs in Germany are presented, in particular, with regard to the analysis of adverse events. Differences in safety considerations between the drug approval process and the benefit assessment are discussed. We show that the naive application of simple proportions in reimbursement dossiers frequently leads to uninterpretable results if observations are censored and the average follow-up periods differ between treatment groups. Likewise, the application of incidence rates may be misleading in the case of recurrent events and unequal follow-up periods. To allow for an appropriate benefit assessment of drugs, adequate survival time methods accounting for time dependencies and duration of follow-up are required, not only for time-to-event efficacy endpoints but also for adverse events. © 2016 The Authors.

Current titanium seed implants, however, are permanent and are limited in clinical application to indolent malignancies of low- to intermediate-risk. Attempts to develop polymeric alternatives, however, have been plagued by poor retention and off-target toxicity due to degradation. Herein, we report on a new approach whereby thermally sensitive micelles composed of an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) are labeled with the radionuclide (131)I to form an in situ hydrogel that is stabilized by two independent mechanisms: first, body heat triggers the radioactive ELP micelles to rapidly phase transition into an insoluble, viscous coacervate in under 2 min; second, the high energy β-emissions of (131)I further stabilize the depot by introducing crosslinks within the ELP depot over 24h. These injectable brachytherapy hydrogels were used to treat two aggressive orthotopic tumor models in athymic nude mice: a human PC-3 M-luc-C6 prostate tumor and a human BxPc3-luc2 pancreatic tumor model. The ELP depots retained greater than 52% and 70% of their radioactivity through 60 days in the prostate and pancreatic tumors with no appreciable radioactive accumulation (≤ 0.1% ID) in off-target tissues after 72h. The (131)I-ELP depots achieved >95% tumor regression in the prostate tumors (n=8); with a median survival of more than 60 days compared to 12 days for control mice. For the pancreatic tumors, ELP brachytherapy (n=6) induced significant growth inhibition (p=0.001, ANOVA) and enhanced median survival to 27 days over controls.""","""['Jeffrey L Schaal', 'Xinghai Li', 'Eric Mastria', 'Jayanta Bhattacharyya', 'Michael R Zalutsky', 'Ashutosh Chilkoti', 'Wenge Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Intratumoral delivery of brachytherapy and immunotherapy by a thermally triggered polypeptide depot.', 'Brachytherapy using injectable seeds that are self-assembled from genetically encoded polypeptides in situ.', 'Spatiotemporally photoradiation-controlled intratumoral depot for combination of brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumor.', 'Drug delivery to solid tumors by elastin-like polypeptides.', 'Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations, the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR) activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins.

Recurrence and metastasis after curative resection remain critical obstacles in HCC treatment. CD146 predicted poor prognosis of a variety of cancers including melanoma, breast tumors, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer. However, the role of CD146 in HCC has not yet been systematically explored.  Methods:   To investigate the role of CD146 in HCC, we evaluated its expression in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines using real-time PCR and western blotting (WB). Second, we established HCC cell lines that stably overexpressed and interfered CD146 and explored the function of CD146 in HCC in vitro and in vivo. Third, we conducted microarray analysis to investigate the potential mechanism by identifying differentially expressed genes. Last, follow ups were conducted to help uncover the connection of CD146 expression and the prognosis of HCC patients.  Results:   We found that CD146 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and that high CD146 expression predicted poor overall survival time and shorter recurrence period in HCC patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that CD146 promoted migration and invasion of HCC cell lines. Further study indicated that CD146 promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), IL-8 upregulation, and STAT1 downregulation. CD146 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines.  Conclusions:   CD146 promoted metastasis of HCC cells and predicted poor prognosis of HCC patients. CD146 induced EMT, and IL-8 upregulation and STAT1 downregulation may be the potential underlying mechanism.

It is well established that β-adrenergic activation (protein kinase A [PKA]/cAMP response element binding protein [CREB]) promotes cancer progression, but the role of thyroid hormones is poorly understood. We analyzed the effects of β-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol [ISO]) and/or thyroid hormone on neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation and cell invasion, using in vivo (LNCaP tumor) and in vitro models (LNCaP and DU145 human cells). Nude mice were inoculated with LNCaP cells and were treated for 6 wks with ISO (200 μg/d), triiodothyronine (T3, 2.5 μg/d) or both. ISO alone reduced tumor growth but increased tumor expression of cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent genes (real-time polymerase chain reaction, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], urokinase plasmin activator [uPA] and metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9]) and some proteins related to NE differentiation and/or invasiveness (synaptophysin, VEGF, pCREB). T3 reduced tumor growth and prevented the overexpression of ISO-stimulated factors through a pCREB-independent mechanism. In low invasive LNCaP cells, 50 μmol/L ISO or 100 nmol/L thyroxine (T4) induced the acquisition of NE-like morphology (phase-contrast microscopy), increased VEGF secretion (ELISA) and invasive capacity (Transwell assay), but no synergistic effects were observed after the coadministration of ISO + T4. In contrast, 10 nmol/L T3 alone had no effect, but it prevented the NE-like morphology and invasiveness stimulated by ISO. None of these treatments had any effect on highly invasive DU145 cells. In summary, this study showed that ISO and T4 increase cancer progression, and T3 attenuates ISO-stimulated progression.

Methods:   AMACR and AR mRNA levels were measured with quantitative, reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays in 79 radical prostatectomy (RP) cases (including 69 benign (RP-Be) and 69 cancerous (RP-PCa) samples) and 19 benign prostate samples obtained from cystoprostatectomies.

In the systematic study of cross-sections, AMACR mRNA was detected in all of the studied areas including histologically benign tissue, but at significantly higher levels in carcinoma areas (p < 0.001). AMACR protein expression was detected in 80 % (28/35) of the areas that contained carcinoma and in 37 % (44/119) of the benign and PIN areas from the same patients.  Conclusions:   AMACR transcripts were detected in all RP-PCa and RP-Be samples but not in non-cancerous CP samples, which suggest a global increase of AMACR expression in cancerous prostates. Therefore patients with false negative biopsies might benefit from an AMACR mRNA measurement when assessing their cancer risk.""","""['Saeid Alinezhad', 'Riina-Minna Väänänen', 'Natalia Tong Ochoa', 'Emily A Vertosick', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Peter J Boström', 'Pekka Taimen', 'Kim Pettersson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Kinetic fluorescence reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase distinguishes prostate cancer from benign lesions.', 'Quantitative Time-Resolved Fluorescence Imaging of Androgen Receptor and Prostate-Specific Antigen in Prostate Tissue Sections.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) expression in normal prostatic glands and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): association with diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Comparative Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of the Impact of Androgen Stimulation and Darolutamide Inhibition.', 'The Role of AMACR, CD10, TMPRSS2-ERG, and p27 Protein Expression Among Different Gleason Grades of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma on Needle Biopsy.', 'Identification of a distinct luminal subgroup diagnosing and stratifying early stage prostate cancer by tissue-based single-cell RNA sequencing.', 'Current Knowledge on the Function of α-Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase in Human Diseases.', 'Metabolomics Contributions to the Discovery of Prostate Cancer Biomarkers.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 45 patients with rising prostate-specific antigen level after prostate radiotherapy who underwent mpMRI [T2-weighted (T2w), diffusion-weighted (Dw) and DCE imaging] at 3T before prostate biopsy. Four readers assigned a 5-level Likert score of cancer likelihood in 8 prostate sectors (6 sextants, 2 seminal vesicles) on T2w+Dw and T2w+Dw+DCE images. Biopsy results were used as the standard of reference.  Results:   T2w+Dw and T2w+Dw+DCE imaging had similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves on per-sector (0.87-0.89 vs. 0.87-0.89; P=0.19-0.78) and per-lobe (0.82-0.94 vs. 0.80-0.91; P=0.21-0.84) analysis.

We aimed to determine the proportion of patients whose low-grade prostate cancer was managed by active surveillance instead of immediate treatment.  Methods:   We reviewed data for patients who were referred to the Ottawa regional Prostate Cancer Assessment Clinic with abnormal results for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or prostate examination between Apr. 1, 2008, and Jan. 31, 2013. Patients with subsequent biopsy-proven low-grade (Gleason score 6) cancer were included. Active surveillance was defined a priori as monitoring by means of PSA, digital rectal examination and repeat biopsies, with the potential for curative-intent treatment in the event of disease progression.  Results:   Of 477 patients with low-grade cancer, active surveillance was used for 210 (44.0%), and the annual proportion increased from 32% (11/34) in 2008 to 67% (20/30) in 2013. Factors associated with immediate treatment were palpable tumour, PSA density above 0.2 ng/mL(2) and more than 2 positive biopsy cores. Factors associated with surveillance were age over 70 years and higher Charlson comorbidity index. Of 173 men who received immediate surgical treatment, 103 (59.5%) had higher-grade or advanced-stage disease on final pathologic examination. Of the 210 men with active surveillance, 62 (29.5%) received treatment within a median of 1.3 years, most commonly (52 [84%]) because of upgrading of disease on the basis of surveillance biopsy.  Interpretation:   Active surveillance has become the most common management strategy for men with low-grade prostate cancer at our regional diagnostic centre.

Moreover, phalloidin was used to label the actin cytoskeleton of breast cancer cells to observe the effect of PMEPA1 silencing on cell morphology.  Results:   In breast cancer cells, PMEPA1 was upregulated by classical TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.

This study aimed to investigate the association between PCa risk and the indicators of endogenous androgen production at puberty, male pattern baldness, over-the-counter use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin supplement use. Materials and methods Participants in the third round of the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial were sent a survey on possible PCa risk factors and 11,795 out of 12,740 (93%) men returned the questionnaire. PCa cases were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Results During the median follow-up of 6.6 years, 757 PCa cases were diagnosed and 21 men died from PCa. Compared to earlier onset, puberty onset after 15 years of age was associated with a borderline significant decrease in PCa risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.00] but not with PCa mortality. Weekly use of ibuprofen was associated with an increased risk of PCa overall (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08-1.91) and with metastatic PCa (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12-1.99) compared to less frequent use. No statistically significant association was found between vitamin use and PCa. Conclusions This study suggests that the timing of initiation of endogenous androgen production at puberty may have importance for later PCa development. Current use of over-the-counter ibuprofen is associated with an increased risk of PCa.

Because radiation therapy (RT) induces DNA damage, we hypothesized that common variation in BRCA1 has a role in progression to lethal prostate cancer, particularly in patients receiving RT.  Methods:   We followed 802 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (cT1-T3/N0/M0) who were treated with RT in the US Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and Physicians' Health Study (PHS), for progression to lethal prostate cancer. Six SNPs (rs3737559, rs1799950, rs799923, rs915945, rs4474733 and rs8176305) were genotyped in HPFS to capture common variation across BRCA1. rs4474733 and rs8176305 were also evaluated in the PHS cohort. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate per-allele hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) stratified by primary treatment.  Results:   In the RT group (n=802), 71 men progressed to lethal disease during a mean follow-up of 12 years.

To investigate predictors of compliance in study-mandated prostate biopsies, we analyzed demographic, clinical and reported lifestyle data from the REDUCE trial.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified 8025 men from REDUCE with at least 2 years of follow-up, and used multivariable logistic regression to test the association between baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and undergoing the study-mandated prostate biopsy at 2 years. We then examined whether missing any of these data was associated with undergoing a biopsy.  Results:   In REDUCE, 22% of men did not undergo a 2-year biopsy. On multivariable analysis, the non-North American region was predictive of 42-44% increased likelihood of undergoing a 2-year biopsy (P⩽0.001). Being enrolled at a center that enrolled >10 subjects (2nd and 3rd tertile) was associated with a 42-48% increased likelihood of undergoing a 2-year biopsy (P<0.001). In addition, black race predicted 44% lower rate of on-study 2-year biopsy (odds ratio (OR)=0.56; P=0.001). Finally, missing one or more baseline variables was associated with a 32% decreased likelihood of undergoing a 2-year biopsy (OR=0.68; P<0.001).  Conclusions:   In REDUCE, men outside North America, those at higher volume centers and those with complete baseline data were more likely to undergo study-mandated 2-year biopsies.

In this study, we analyzed cancer genomes from rare types of metastatic AYA cancers to identify driving and/or druggable genetic alterations.  Methods:   Prospectively collected AYA tumor samples from seven different patients were analyzed using three different genomics platforms (whole-exome sequencing, whole-transcriptome sequencing or OncoScan™). Using well-known bioinformatics tools (bwa, Picard, GATK, MuTect, and Somatic Indel Detector) and our annotation approach with open access databases (DAVID and DGIdb), we processed sequencing data and identified driving genetic alterations and their druggability.  Results:   The mutation frequencies of AYA cancers were lower than those of other adult cancers (median = 0.56), except for a germ cell tumor with hypermutation. We identified patient-specific genetic alterations in candidate driving genes: RASA2 and NF1 (prostate cancer), TP53 and CDKN2C (olfactory neuroblastoma), FAT1, NOTCH1, and SMAD4 (head and neck cancer), KRAS (urachal carcinoma), EML4-ALK (lung cancer), and MDM2 and PTEN (liposarcoma). We then suggested potential drugs for each patient according to his or her altered genes and related pathways. By comparing candidate driving genes between AYA cancers and those from all age groups for the same type of cancer, we identified different driving genes in prostate cancer and a germ cell tumor in AYAs compared with all age groups, whereas three common alterations (TP53, FAT1, and NOTCH1) in head and neck cancer were identified in both groups.  Conclusion:   We identified the patient-specific genetic alterations and druggability of seven rare types of AYA cancers using three genomics platforms. Additionally, genetic alterations in cancers from AYA and those from all age groups varied by cancer type.""","""['Soojin Cha', 'Jeongeun Lee', 'Jong-Yeon Shin', 'Ji-Yeon Kim', 'Sung Hoon Sim', 'Bhumsuk Keam', 'Tae Min Kim', 'Dong-Wan Kim', 'Dae Seog Heo', 'Se-Hoon Lee', 'Jong-Il Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Comprehensive characterization of genes associated with the TP53 signal transduction pathway in various tumors.', 'Optimized pipeline of MuTect and GATK tools to improve the detection of somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms in whole-exome sequencing data.', 'Whole-Exome Sequencing of Metastatic Cancer and Biomarkers of Treatment Response.', 'Using high-throughput sequencing transcriptome data for INDEL detection: challenges for cancer drug discovery.', 'Using CellMiner 1.6 for Systems Pharmacology and Genomic Analysis of the NCI-60.', 'Progress and prospects of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for urachal carcinoma.', 'Surgical and functional outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in adolescents and young adults: a propensity score matching study.', 'The genomics and epigenetics of olfactory neuroblastoma: A\u2009systematic review.', 'Comprehensive characterization of distinct genetic alterations in metastatic breast cancer across various metastatic sites.', 'Prevalence of APC and PTEN Alterations in Urachal Cancer.']"""

Our aim was to quantify cancer specific and other cause mortality rates after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 8,741 patients with prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2009 at a European center. Ten-year other cause and cancer specific mortality rates were determined by age and comorbidities, and age and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical (CAPRA-S) risk groups. Competing risk regression was used for risk factor analyses including clinical and pathological variables.  Results:   Ten-year other cause mortality rates increased with patient age, including 4.8%, 9.8%, 13.6% and 16.5% in men younger than 60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69 and 70 years or older, respectively. Cancer specific mortality was the leading cause of death in CAPRA-S high risk cases regardless of age. On multivariate analyses age groups achieved independent predictor status for other cause mortality (ages 60 to 64 years HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26-2.62, 65 to 69 years HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.73-3.56 and 70 years or greater HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.97-4.62) as well as Charlson comorbidity indexes 1 (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.00-2.09) and 3 or greater (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.57-10.1). Gleason score 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 or greater, pT3b stage, lymph node invasion and positive margin status achieved independent predictor status when the end point was cancer specific mortality. The CAPRA-S high risk constellation increased cancer specific mortality risk in multifold fashion (HR 26, 95% CI 16-56).  Conclusions:   In patients with the CAPRA-S high risk constellation the rate of cancer specific mortality increased in multifold fashion and contributed to most deaths regardless of patient age. Low other cause mortality rates in all age groups showed reasonable patient selection.""","""['Katharina Boehm', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Zhe Tian', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Jonas Schiffmann', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Competing risk analysis after radical prostatectomy for clinically nonmetastatic prostate adenocarcinoma according to clinical Gleason score and patient age.', 'Risk Stratification of pN+ Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy from a Large Single Institutional Series with Long-Term Followup.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Importance of radical prostatectomy for patients older than 70 years.', 'Effect of Clinical Parameters on Risk of Death from Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of Grade Groups on Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality: Competing Risk Analysis from a Large Single Institution Series.', 'Effects of Radiotherapy or Radical Prostatectomy on the Risk of Long-Term Heart-Specific Death in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Cause of Mortality after Radical Prostatectomy and the Impact of Comorbidity in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Multi-institutional Study in Korea.', 'Surgical margin status and its impact on prostate cancer prognosis after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis.']"""

These derivatives were synthesized from 16-dehydropregnenolone acetate. The activity on cell proliferation of the compounds was measured on three human cancer cells lines: prostate cancer (PC-3), breast cancer (MCF7) and lung cancer (SK-LU-1). The cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of T-OH and I-OH were assessed by using SBR and XTT methods, respectively. The gene expressions were evaluated by real time PCR. In addition, results were complemented by docking studies and transactivation assays using an expression vector to progesterone and androgen receptor. Results show that the two compounds inhibited the three cell lines proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Compound I-OH downregulated the gene expression of the cyclins D1 and E1 in PC-3 and MFC7 cells; however, effect upon Ki-67, EAG1, BIM or survivin genes was not observed. Docking studies show poor interaction with the steroid receptors. Nevertheless, the transactivation assays show a weak antagonist effect of I-OH on progesterone receptor but not androgenic or antiandrogenic actions. In conclusion, the synthesized compounds inhibited cell proliferation as well as genes key to cell cycle of PC-3 and MCF7 cell lines.

We used Poisson models with adjustment for age and date of follow up to estimate hazard ratios for total and site-specific cancers.  Results:   A total of 9,149 cancers occurred among persons with type 1 diabetes in 3.9 million person-years. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 51.1 years (interquartile range 43.5-59.5). The hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) associated with type 1 diabetes for all cancers combined were 1.01 (0.98, 1.04) among men and 1.07 (1.04, 1.10) among women. HRs were increased for cancer of the stomach (men, HR 1.23 [1.04, 1.46]; women, HR 1.78 [1.49, 2.13]), liver (men, HR 2.00 [1.67, 2.40]; women, HR 1.55 [1.14, 2.10]), pancreas (men, HR 1.53 [1.30, 1.79]; women, HR 1.25 [1.02,1.53]), endometrium (HR 1.42 [1.27, 1.58]) and kidney (men, HR 1.30 [1.12, 1.49]; women, HR 1.47 [1.23, 1.77]). Reduced HRs were found for cancer of the prostate (HR 0.56 [0.51, 0.61]) and breast (HR 0.90 [0.85, 0.94]). HRs declined with increasing diabetes duration.  Conclusion:   Type 1 diabetes was associated with differences in the risk of several common cancers; the strength of these associations varied with the duration of diabetes.""","""['Bendix Carstensen', 'Stephanie H Read', 'Søren Friis', 'Reijo Sund', 'Ilmo Keskimäki', 'Ann-Marie Svensson', 'Rickard Ljung', 'Sarah H Wild', 'Joannes J Kerssens', 'Jessica L Harding', 'Dianna J Magliano', 'Soffia Gudbjörnsdottir;Diabetes and Cancer Research Consortium']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Diabetologia""","""['Risk of cancer in young and middle-aged adults with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in Sweden-A prospective cohort study.', 'Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Fasting serum glucose level and cancer risk in Korean men and women.', 'The epidemiology of diabetes and cancer.', 'Diabetes and cancer I: risk, survival, and implications for screening.', 'Circulating microRNAs in young individuals with long-duration type 1 diabetes in comparison with healthy controls.', 'Diabetes mellitus and the female reproductive system tumors.', 'Diabetes mellitus and risk of breast cancer: a large-scale, prospective, population-based study.', 'Can type 1 diabetes be an unexpected complication of obesity?', 'Mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes mellitus-related pancreatic carcinogenesis: a comprehensive and systematic review.']"""

But many aspects of DNA methylation remain unexplored, including the individual roles of distal and gene body methylation, as well as their collaborative roles with promoter methylation. Here we performed a MBD-seq analysis on prostate specimens classified into low, high, and very high risk group based on Gleason score and TNM stages. We identified gene sets with differential methylation regions (DMRs) in Distal, TSS, gene body and TES. To understand the collaborative roles, TSS was compared with the other three DMRs, resulted in 12 groups of genes with collaborative differential methylation patterns (CDMPs). We found several groups of genes that show opposite methylation patterns in Distal and Genic regions compared to TSS region, and in general they are differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumors in TCGA RNA-seq data. IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) reveals AR/TP53 signaling network to be a major signaling pathway, and survival analysis indicates genes subsets significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence.

Immediately after biopsy 43/201 (21.4%) of men felt light-headed, syncopal, or suffered syncope. Fifty-three percent of men felt discomfort after biopsy (with 95% scoring <5 in a 0-10 scale). Twelve out of 196 men (6.1%) felt pain immediately after the procedure.

Patients in cohorts of 3 were treated with escalating doses of APC-100 (900 mg-2400 mg) orally once daily continuously. Cycles were 28 days.  Results:   Twenty patients with CRPC were enrolled in the dose escalation cohort. One possible DLT (elevated ALT) was seen at dose level 1. No other DLTs were seen and no dose reductions were required. Most frequent AEs included nausea (grade 1 in 6 patients) and elevated transaminases (grade 1-3 in 5 patients).

Consistent with this profile, basal cells functionally exhibit intrinsic stem-like and neurogenic properties with enhanced rRNA transcription activity.

Ki67 and vimentin are well-characterised markers of tumour cell proliferation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively. Here we asked if the expression of vimentin and Ki67 in CTCs offered prognostic or predictive information in mCRPC.  Methods:   In two separate patient cohorts, anti-vimentin or anti-Ki67 antibodies were added to the free channel in the CellSearch® system for analysis of peripheral blood samples. For each cohort, association of CTC number with clinical characteristics were assessed using Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to analyse overall survival (OS) of vimentin-expressing and Ki67-expressing CTC patient cohorts.  Results:   In this retrospective analysis, CTC vimentin expression was analysed in 142 blood samples from 93 patients, and CTC Ki67 expression was analysed in 90 blood samples from 51 patients. In the vimentin cohort, 80/93 (86 %) of baseline samples from patients were CTC-positive overall (≥1 total CTC per 7.5 mls blood), and 30/93 (32.3 %) vimentin CTC-positive (≥1 vimentin-positive CTC per 7.5 mls blood). 41/51 (80.4 %) of baseline samples from patients in the Ki67 cohort were CTC-positive overall, and 23/51 (45.1 %) Ki67 CTC-positive (≥1 Ki67-positive CTC per 7.5 mls blood). There was no significant difference in baseline PSA in patients with vimentin-positive CTC at baseline versus those with no vimentin-positive CTC at baseline (p = 0.33). A significant reduction in OS was shown in patients with vimentin-positive CTC compared to those without vimentin-positive CTC (median 305 days vs 453 days, p = 0.0293). There was no significant difference in baseline PSA in patients with Ki67-positive CTC at baseline versus those without Ki67-positive CTC (p = 0.228), but OS was significantly reduced in the Ki67-positive CTC group (median 512 days vs 751 days, p = 0.0091). No changes in relative proportion of vimentin- or Ki67-positive CTCs were observed in post-treatment samples compared to baseline.

There are 2 techniques to assess rectal volume for reception of a specific dose: relative-DVH (R-DVH, %) that indicates relative volume for a vertical axis, and absolute-DVH (A-DVH, cc) with its vertical axis showing absolute volume of the rectum. The parameters of DVH vary depending on the rectum delineation method, but the literature does not present any standardization of such methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different delineation methods on rectal DVHs. The enrollment for this study comprised 28 patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer, who had undergone intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with the prescription dose of 78Gy. The rectum was contoured with 4 different methods using 2 lengths, short (Sh) and long (Lg), and 2 cross sections, rectum (Rec) and rectal wall (Rw). Sh means the length from 1cm above the seminal vesicles to 1cm below the prostate and Lg the length from the rectosigmoid junction to the anus. Rec represents the entire rectal volume including the rectal contents and Rw the rectal volume of the area with a wall thickness of 4mm. We compared dose-volume parameters by using 4 rectal contour methods for the same plan with the R-DVHs as well as the A-DVHs. For the high dose levels, the R-DVH parameters varied widely. The mean of V70 for Sh-Rw was the highest (19.4%) and nearly twice as high as that for Lg-Rec (10.4%). On the contrary, only small variations were observed in the A-DVH parameters (4.3, 4.3, 5.5, and 5.5cc for Sh-Rw, Lg-Rw, Sh-Rec, and Lg-Rec, respectively). As for R-DVHs, the parameters of V70 varied depending on the rectal lengths (Sh-Rec vs Lg-Rec: R = 0.76; Sh-Rw vs Lg-Rw: R = 0.85) and cross sections (Sh-Rec vs Sh-Rw: R = 0.49; Lg-Rec vs Lg-Rw: R = 0.65). For A-DVHs, however, the parameters of Sh rectal A-DVHs hardly changed regardless of differences in rectal length at all dose levels. Moreover, at high dose levels (V70), the parameters of A-DVHs showed less dependence on rectal cross sections (Sh-Rec vs Sh-Rw: R = 0.66; Lg-Rec vs Lg-Rw: R = 0.59). This study showed that A-DVHs were less dependent on the delineation methods than R-DVHs, especially for evaluating the rectal dose at higher dose levels. It can therefore be assumed that, in addition to R-DVHs, A-DVHs can be used for evaluating rectal toxicity.""","""['Chiaki Kusumoto', 'Shingo Ohira', 'Masayoshi Miyazaki', 'Yoshihiro Ueda', 'Masaru Isono', 'Teruki Teshima']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Various techniques of contouring the rectum and their impact on rectal dose-volume histograms.', 'Distinct effects of rectum delineation methods in 3D-conformal vs. IMRT treatment planning of prostate cancer.', 'Late rectal bleeding after conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

This study examined the effect of a four-session individualized and supervised exercise program on the physical and psychosocial health of prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   Fifty-one prostate cancer survivors (mean age 69±7 years) were prescribed 1 h, individualized, supervised exercise sessions once weekly for 4 weeks. Participants were encouraged to increase their physical activity levels outside of the exercise sessions. Objective measures of muscular strength, exercise capacity, physical function and flexibility; and self-reported general, disease-specific and psychosocial health were assessed at baseline and following the intervention.  Results:   Improvements were observed in muscle strength (leg press 17.6 percent; P < 0.001), exercise capacity (400-m walk 9.3 percent; P < 0.001), physical function (repeated chair stands 20.1 percent, usual gait speed 19.3 percent, timed up-and-go 15.0 percent; P < 0.001), flexibility (chair sit and reach +2.9 cm; P < 0.001) and positive well-being (P = 0.014) following the exercise program.  Conclusion:   A four-session exercise program significantly improved the muscular strength, exercise capacity, physical function and positive well-being of prostate cancer survivors. This short-duration exercise program is safe and feasible for prostate cancer survivors and a randomized controlled trial is now required to determine whether a similar individualized exercise regimen improves physical health and mental well-being over the short, medium and long term.""","""['Tina L Skinner', 'Gmme Geeske Peeters', 'Ilaria Croci', 'Katherine R Bell', 'Nicola W Burton', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Kate A Bolam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Effects of a Community-Based Multimodal Exercise Program on Health-Related Physical Fitness and Physical Function in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Pilot Study.', 'Effects of a community-based multimodal exercise program on physical function and quality of life in cancer survivors: a pilot study.', 'Evaluation of a supervised multi-modal physical exercise program for prostate cancer survivors in the rehabilitation phase: Rationale and study protocol of the ProCaLife study.', 'Fitness and Quality of Life Outcomes of Cancer Survivor Participants in a Community Exercise Program.', 'A systematic review of physical activity in prostate cancer survivors: outcomes, prevalence, and determinants.', 'Community-based exercise programs for cancer survivors: a scoping review of practice-based evidence.', ""Feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a text message-enhanced clinical exercise rehabilitation intervention for increasing 'whole-of-day' activity in people living with and beyond cancer."", 'The physical activity of colorectal cancer survivors during chemotherapy : Based on the theory of planned behavior.', 'Interventions for promoting habitual exercise in people living with and beyond cancer.', 'One-Year Comparison of a Community-Based Exercise Program Versus a Day Hospital-Based Exercise Program on Quality of Life and Mental Health in Severely Burned Children.']"""

Mean age at time of PCa diagnosis was 69 years. Men with glucose levels >6.9 mmol/L tend to have PSA<4 μg/L, while those with glucose levels of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L had a greater odds of PSA>20 μg/L compared to PSA 4.0-9.9 μg/L. Hypertriglyceridemia was also positively associated with PSA>20 μg/L. Hyperglycemic men had a greater odds of intermediate- and high-grade PCa and advanced stage or metastatic PCa. Similarly, hypertriglyceridemia was positively associated with high-grade PCa. There was also a trend toward an increased odds of intermediate risk localized PCa and advanced stage PCa among men with hypertriglyceridemia. Total cholesterol did not have any statistically significant association with any of the outcomes studied.

An Institutional validation study""","""Introduction:   New generations of tumor markers used to detect prostate cancer (PCa) should be able to discriminate men with aggressive PCa of those without PCa or nonaggressive tumors. The objective of this study has been to validate Prostate Health Index (PHI) as a marker of aggressive PCa in one academic institution.  Methods:   PHI was assessed in 357 men scheduled to prostatic biopsy between June of 2013 and July 2014 in one academic institution. Thereafter a subset of 183 men younger than 75 years and total PSA (tPSA) between 3.0 and 10.0 ng/mL, scheduled to it first prostatic biopsy, was retrospectively selected for this study. Twelve cores TRUS guided biopsy, under local anaesthesia, was performed in all cases. Total PSA, free PSA (fPSA), and [-2] proPSA (p2PSA) and prostate volume were determined before the procedure and %fPSA, PSA density (PSAd) and PHI were calculated. Aggressive tumors were considered if any Gleason 4 pattern was found. PHI was compared to %fPSA and PSAd through their ROC curves. Thresholds to detect 90%, 95% of all tumors and 95% and 100% of aggressive tumors were estimated and rates of unnecessary avoided biopsies were calculated and compared.  Results:   The rate of PCa detection was 37.2% (68) and the rate of aggressive tumors was 24.6% (45). The PHI area under the curve was higher than those of %fPSA and PSAd to detect any PCa (0.749 vs 0.606 and 0.668 respectively) or to detect only aggressive tumors (0.786 vs 0.677 and 0.708 respectively), however, significant differences were not found. The avoided biopsy rates to detect 95% of aggressive tumors were 20.2% for PHI, 14.8% for %fPSA, and 23.5% for PSAd. Even more, to detect all aggressive tumors these rates dropped to 4.9% for PHI, 9.3% for %fPSA, and 7.9% for PSAd.  Conclusions:   PHI seems a good marker to PCa diagnosis. However, PHI was not superior to %fPSA and PSAd to identify at least 95% of aggressive tumors.""","""['J Morote', 'A Celma', 'J Planas', 'J Placer', 'R Ferrer', 'I de Torres', 'R Pacciuci', 'M Olivan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Clinical performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, %p2PSA and the prostate health index (PHI), in men with a family history of prostate cancer: results from a multicentre European study, the PROMEtheuS project.', 'Usefulness of the prostate health index in predicting the presence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean men: a prospective observational study.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Identification of a serum biomarker signature associated with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Engaging African American Men as Citizen Scientists to Validate a Prostate Cancer Biomarker: Work-in-Progress.', 'Comparative Study of Blood-Based Biomarkers, α2,3-Sialic Acid PSA and PHI, for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Detection.']"""

Intensity of Followup during Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in the United States""","""Purpose:   While major prostate cancer active surveillance programs recommend repeat testing such as prostate specific antigen and prostate biopsy, to our knowledge compliance with such testing is unknown. We determined whether men in the community receive the same intensity of active surveillance testing as in prospective active surveillance protocols.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of men 66 years old or older in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database. These men were diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2001 to 2009, did not receive curative therapy in the year after diagnosis and underwent 1 or more post-diagnosis prostate biopsies. We used multivariable adjusted Poisson regression to determine the association of the frequency of active surveillance testing with patient demographics and clinical features. In 1,349 men with 5 years of followup we determined the proportion who underwent testing as intense as that recommended by the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and PRIAS (Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance) programs, including 14 or more PSA tests and 2 or more biopsies, and The Johns Hopkins program, including 10 or more prostate specific antigen tests and 4 or more biopsies.  Results:   Among 5,192 patients undergoing active surveillance greater than 80% had 1 or more prostate specific antigen tests per year but fewer than 13% underwent biopsy beyond the first 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging was rarely done during the study period. On multivariable analysis recent diagnosis and higher income were associated with a higher frequency of surveillance biopsy while older age and greater comorbidity were associated with fewer biopsies. African American men underwent fewer prostate specific antigen tests but a similar number of biopsies. During 5 years of active surveillance only 11.1% and 5.0% of patients met the testing standards of the Sunnybrook/PRIAS and The Johns Hopkins programs, respectively.

Initial clinical experience with six prospectively studied patients""","""Background:   Based on promising preclinical data, ketogenic diets (KDs) have been proposed as supplementary measures for cancer patients undergoing standard-of-care therapy. However, data is still scarce on the tolerability and effects of KDs on cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Here we present six cases of patients who underwent RT and concurrently consumed a self-administered KD in our clinic within a busy community hospital setting.  Methods:   All patients were followed prospectively with measurements of blood parameters, quality of life and body weight and composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis.  Results:   No adverse diet-related side effects occurred. Two patients had no elevated ketone body levels in serum despite self-reporting compliance to the diet. There was consensus that the KD was satiating and weight loss occurred in all patients, although this was only significant in two patients. Our data indicate that weight loss was mainly due to fat mass loss with concurrent preservation of muscle mass. Overall quality of life remained fairly stable, and all subjects reported feeling good on the diet. Tumor regression occurred as expected in five patients with early stage disease; however one subject with metastatic small cell lung cancer experienced slight progression during three cycles of combined chemotherapy + KD and progressed rapidly after ending the KD.  Conclusions:   Our data lend support to the hypothesis that KDs administered as supportive measures during standard therapy are safe and might be helpful in preservation of muscle mass. Further studies with control groups are needed to confirm these findings and address questions regarding any putative anti-tumor effects. Based on the experience with these six cases we implemented further steps to improve issues with KD compliance and initiated a clinical study that is described in a companion paper.""","""['Rainer J Klement', 'Reinhart A Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Impact of a ketogenic diet intervention during radiotherapy on body composition: III-final results of the KETOCOMP study for breast cancer patients.', 'Impact of a ketogenic diet intervention during radiotherapy on body composition: IV.

Methods:   In silico analysis of TCGA data was performed to identify relevant NRs in HGSOC. Ovarian cancer cell lines were screened for NR expression and functional studies were performed to determine the significance of these NRs in ovarian cancers. NR expression was analyzed in ovarian cancer tissue samples using immunohistochemistry to identify correlations with histology and stage of disease.  Results:   The NR4A family of NRs was identified as a potential driver of ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Overexpression of NR4A1 in particular correlated with worse progression free survival. Endogenous expression of NR4A1 in normal ovarian samples was relatively high compared to that of other tissue types, suggesting a unique role for this orphan receptor in the ovary. Expression of NR4A1 in HGSOC cell lines as well as in patient samples was variable. NR4A1 primarily localized to the nucleus in normal ovarian tissue while co-localization within the cytoplasm and nucleus was noted in ovarian cancer cell lines and patient tissues.

However the factors that control PPARγ within the prostate cancers have not been characterized. The goal of this study was to examine whether the androgen receptor (AR) regulates PPARγ expression and function within human prostate cancer cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed nanomolar concentrations of the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decrease PPARγ mRNA and protein within the castration-resistant, AR-positive C4-2 and VCaP human prostate cancer cell lines. The AR antagonists bicalutamide and enzalutamide blocked the ability of DHT to reduce PPARγ levels. In addition, siRNA mediated knockdown of AR increased PPARγ protein levels and ligand-induced PPARγ transcriptional activity within the C4-2 cell line. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors that interfere with AR function increased the level of basal PPARγ and prevented the DHT-mediated suppression of PPARγ. These data suggest that AR normally functions to suppress PPARγ expression within AR-positive prostate cancer cells. To determine whether increases in AR protein would influence PPARγ expression and activity, we used lipofectamine-based transfections to overexpress AR within the AR-null PC-3 cells. The addition of AR to PC-3 cells did not significantly alter PPARγ protein levels. However, the ability of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone to induce activation of a PPARγ-driven luciferase reporter and induce expression of FABP4 was suppressed in AR-positive PC-3 cells. Together, these data indicate AR serves as a key modulator of PPARγ expression and function within prostate tumors. J. Cell.

On multiple logistic regression analysis, protrusion of the prostate into the bladder was significantly associated with positive resection margins (P = .04).  Conclusion:   The findings of the present study suggest that poor VPA, protrusion of the prostate into the bladder, and high BMI were related to operative difficulties in extraperitoneal LRP.

TXN members are involved in a wide range of biochemical and biological functions including redox regulation, refolding of disulfide containing proteins, and regulation of transcription factors. In the present study, a thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 was identified and characterized from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii (RfTXNDC12). The full length of RfTXNDC12 consists of a 522-bp coding region encoding a 173-amino acid protein. It has a 29-amino acid signal peptide and a single TXN active site with a consensus atypical WCGAC active motif. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the active site is conserved among vertebrates. RfTXNDC12 shares highest identity with its Epinephelus coioides homolog. Transcriptional analysis revealed its ubiquitous expression in a wide range of tissues with the highest expression in the ovary. Immune challenges conducted with Streptococcus iniae and poly I:C caused upregulation of RfTXNDC12 transcript levels in gills and peripheral blood cells (PBCs), while lipopolysaccharide injection caused downregulation of RfTXNDC12 in gills and upregulation in PBCs. Similar to TXN, RfTXNDC12 exhibited insulin disulfide reducing activity. Interestingly, the recombinant protein showed significant protection of LNCaP cells against apoptosis induced by H2O2-mediated oxidative stress in a concentration dependent manner. Collectively, the present data indicate that RfTXNDC12 is a TXN superfamily member, which could function as a potential antioxidant enzyme and be involved in a defense mechanism against immune challenges.""","""['William Shanthakumar Thulasitha', 'Navaneethaiyer Umasuthan', 'R G P T Jayasooriya', 'Jae Koo Noh', 'Hae-Chul Park', 'Jehee Lee']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['Comparative analysis of two thioredoxin-like genes in black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii and their possible involvement in redox homeostasis and innate immune responses.', 'Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 from Oplegnathus fasciatus: Molecular characterization, expression against immune stimuli, and biological activities related to oxidative stress.', 'A teleostan homolog of catalase from black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii): insights into functional roles in host antioxidant defense and expressional responses to septic conditions.', 'Similarities and differences in the thioredoxin superfamily.', 'Antioxidant function of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems.', 'Rapid Genomic Evolution Drives the Diversification of Male Reproductive Genes in Dung Beetles.', 'Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal potential mechanisms linking thermal stress and depressed disease resistance in the turbot Scophthalmus maximus.']"""

Distinguishing between these subtypes is critically important because they have different implications for prognosis and treatment. Normally, histopathological analyses are used to distinguish between the two, where the tissue samples are collected based on small endoscopic samples or needle aspirations. However, the lack of cell architecture in these small tissue samples hampers the process of distinguishing between the two subtypes. Molecular profiling can also be used to discriminate between the two lung cancer subtypes, on condition that the biopsy is composed of at least 50 % of tumor cells. However, for some cases, the tissue composition of a biopsy might be a mix of tumor and tumor-adjacent histologically normal tissue (TAHN). When this happens, a new biopsy is required, with associated cost, risks and discomfort to the patient. To avoid this problem, we hypothesize that a computational method can distinguish between lung cancer subtypes given tumor and TAHN tissue.  Methods:   Using publicly available datasets for gene expression and DNA methylation, we applied four classification tasks, depending on the possible combinations of tumor and TAHN tissue. First, we used a feature selector (ReliefF/Limma) to select relevant variables, which were then used to build a simple naïve Bayes classification model. Then, we evaluated the classification performance of our models by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, we analyzed the relevance of the selected genes using hierarchical clustering and IPA® software for gene functional analysis.  Results:   All Bayesian models achieved high classification performance (AUC > 0.94), which were confirmed by hierarchical cluster analysis. From the genes selected, 25 (93 %) were found to be related to cancer (19 were associated with ADC or SCC), confirming the biological relevance of our method.  Conclusions:   The results from this study confirm that computational methods using tumor and TAHN tissue can serve as a prognostic tool for lung cancer subtype classification. Our study complements results from other studies where TAHN tissue has been used as prognostic tool for prostate cancer. The clinical implications of this finding could greatly benefit lung cancer patients.""","""['Arturo López Pineda', 'Henry Ato Ogoe', 'Jeya Balaji Balasubramanian', 'Claudia Rangel Escareño', 'Shyam Visweswaran', 'James Gordon Herman', 'Vanathi Gopalakrishnan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Proliferation genes in lung development associated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma but not squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Identification of microRNAs differentially expressed between lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Analysis of lncRNA expression profiles in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and their clinical subtypes.', 'Genome analyses identify the genetic modification of lung cancer subtypes.', 'A global view of regulatory networks in lung cancer: An approach to understand homogeneity and heterogeneity.', 'Endometrial Cancer-Adjacent Tissues Express Higher Levels of Cancer-Promoting Genes than the Matched Tumors.', 'Genome-Wide Plasma Cell-Free DNA Methylation Profiling Identifies Potential Biomarkers for Lung Cancer.', 'Application of omics in predicting anti-TNF efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis.']"""

Here, we investigated the effects of edelfosine combined with androgen deprivation (AD) in LNCaP and VCaP human prostate cancer cells. This treatment regimen greatly decreased cell proliferation compared with single agent or AD alone, resulting in higher levels of apoptosis in LNCaP compared with VCaP cells. Edelfosine caused a dose-dependent decrease in AKT activity, but did not affect the expression of total AKT in either cell line. Furthermore, edelfosine treatment inhibited the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and was associated with an increase in activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expression levels, a stress response gene and a negative regulator of AR transactivation. ATF3 binds to AR after edelfosine + AD and represses the transcriptional activation of AR as demonstrated by PSA promoter studies. Knockdown of ATF3 using siRNA-ATF3 reversed the inhibition of PSA promoter activity, suggesting that the growth inhibition effect of edelfosine was ATF3 dependent. Moreover, expression of AR variant 7 (ARv7) and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene were greatly inhibited after combined treatment with AD and edelfosine in VCaP cells. In vivo experiments using an orthotopic LNCaP model confirmed the antitumor effects of edelfosine + AD over the individual treatments. A significant decrease in tumor volume and PSA levels was observed when edelfosine and AD were combined, compared with edelfosine alone. Edelfosine shows promise in combination with AD for the treatment of prostate cancer patients.

Published studies have selectively reported on low-risk disease using non-validated and poorly defined thresholds for EF recovery.  Aim:   To assess return to baseline EF in men after robotic radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.  Materials:   Five hundred thirty-one men underwent robotic radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer from February 2010 through July 2014. Pre- and postoperative EF was prospectively assessed using the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined the effect of age, preoperative function, comorbidities, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, cancer stage or grade, nerve-sparing status, adjuvant therapy, and continence on EF return (defined as postoperative return to baseline EF with or without use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to analyze return over time. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare IIEF-5 scores.  Main outcome measures:   Pre- and postoperative EF was assessed using the IIEF-5 Sexual Health Inventory for Men at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years postoperatively.  Results:   Overall, return of EF was seen in 23.5% of patients at 18 months. This was significantly increased in men no older than 60 years (P = .024), with a preoperative IIEF-5 score of at least 22 (P = .042), and after undergoing neurovascular bundle preservation (34.9% of patients, P < .001). There was no significant change in IIEF-5 scores from 3 to 36 months in patients who were treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the non-neurovascular bundle preservation group (P = .87), although there was significant improvement in those receiving second- or third-line therapies (P = .042). Other than preoperative hypertension (P = .03), none of the other comorbidities predicted return of EF.  Conclusion:   In this study, 23.5% of men recovered to baseline EF. Of those who underwent bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation robotic radical prostatectomy, 70% recovered baseline EF; however, this accounted for only 9.6% of all patients. Only 4% of men who underwent non-neurovascular bundle preservation had baseline recovery with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors up to 36 months. There was significant improvement after use of second- or third-line therapies, indicating the need for earlier institution of these treatment modalities.""","""['Ashwin N Sridhar', 'Paul J Cathcart', 'Tet Yap', 'John Hines', 'Senthil Nathan', 'Timothy P Briggs', 'John D Kelly', 'Suks Minhas']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Re: Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Erectile Function Recovery After Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Is Back to Baseline Status Enough for Patient Satisfaction?', 'Effects of Tadalafil Once-Daily or On-Demand vs Placebo on Return to Baseline Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy--Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial (REACTT).', 'Predicting erectile function outcome in men after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Penile Rehabilitation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Comparison of the efficacy of the early LI-SWT plus daily tadalafil with daily tadalafil only as penile rehabilitation for postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Is it Worth Starting Sexual Rehabilitation Before Radical Prostatectomy?

Patients and methods:   We compared the concordance rates of Gleason grades diagnosed on biopsies and prostatectomy specimens in 375 consecutive patients, including 106 saturation biopsies (18-33 cores, median = 20 cores) and 269 12-core biopsies. Grading bias was addressed by a central rereview of all cases that had discordance in reporting high Gleason grades (Gleason grade ≥ 4) on biopsies and prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   For patients with high Gleason grades on final pathology, saturation and 12-core biopsy schemes had a comparable sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values (72.5% vs 69.5%, 91.9% vs 97.6%, 64.2% vs 58.4%, and 94.3% vs 98.5%, respectively) in detecting high Gleason grades. On multivariate analysis, prebiopsy serum prostate-specific antigen and clinical T stage independently predicted Gleason upgrading; saturation biopsy was not a significant predictor. Approximately one-third of cases where high Gleason grade was not present in the biopsy were attributed to the confinement of high-grade tumors to unusual anatomic locations such as anterior lobes, apex, bladder neck, and parasagittal zones.  Conclusion:   Our study showed that Gleason misclassification rate is independent of the number of biopsy cores in systematic biopsy. One of the reasons for missing high Gleason grade tumors on systematic biopsy was unusual tumor location outside of the biopsy grid, supporting the need for improved detection technique such as magnetic resonance imaging-guided targeted biopsies.""","""['Liza Quintana', 'Ashley Ward', 'Sean J Gerrin', 'Elizabeth M Genega', 'Seymour Rosen', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Andrew A Wagner', 'Peter Chang', 'William C DeWolf', 'Huihui Ye']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Gleason Misclassification Rate is Independent of Number of Biopsy Cores in Systematic Biopsy.', 'Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'Increasing the number of biopsies increases the concordance of Gleason scores of needle biopsies and prostatectomy specimens.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Correlation between Gleason Scores in Needle Biopsy and Corresponding Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: A Twelve-Year Review.', 'The Values of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in the Localized Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia: A Retrospective Clinical Study.', 'The Role of Multiparametric MRI and MRI-targeted Biopsy in Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in the Community Setting: A Retrospective Study.', 'Extent and predictors of grade upgrading and downgrading in an Australian cohort according to the new prostate cancer grade groupings.', 'Use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and fusion-guided biopsies to properly select and follow African-American men on active surveillance.', 'Super active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer | Opinion: No.']"""

Our previous work has demonstrated that MnTE-2-PyP significantly protects urogenital tissues from radiation-induced damage. So, in order for MnTE-2-PyP to be used clinically as a radio-protector, it is fully necessary to explore the effect of MnTE-2-PyP on human prostate cancer progression. MnTE-2-PyP inhibited prostate cancer growth in the presence and absence of radiation and also inhibited prostate cancer migration and invasion. MnTE-2-PyP altered p300 DNA binding, which resulted in the inhibition of HIF-1β and CREB signaling pathways. Accordingly, we also found that MnTE-2-PyP reduced the expression of three genes regulated by HIF-1β and/or CREB: TGF-β2, FGF-1 and PAI-1. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP decreased p300 complex binding to a specific HRE motif within the PAI-1 gene promoter region, suppressed H3K9 acetylation, and consequently, repressed PAI-1 expression. Mechanistically, less p300 transcriptional complex binding is not due to the reduction of binding between p300 and HIF-1/CREB transcription factors, but through inhibiting the binding of HIF-1/CREB transcription factors to DNA.

In multivariate analyses, the primary biopsy GS, secondary biopsy GS and obesity were predictive of GSU in the patient cohort assessed. In patients with GS=6, the significant predictors of GSU included the body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen density(PSAD) and percentage of positive cores. The area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction models was 0.753 for the entire patient population and 0.727 for the patients with GS=6. Both nomograms were well calibrated, and decision curve analysis demonstrated a high net benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities.

Materials and methods:   We randomly selected 201 patients treated with RP and EBRT between 2005 and 2015. Visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes were manually contoured and corresponding tissue densities in Hounsfield units (HU) calculated. Time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was done for multivariate analysis.  Results:   Median time to BCR or last follow-up was 32 months. In univariate analysis for BCR, VAT volume and fat density were both associated with a better outcome (p=0.025 and p=0.024, respectively) as well as seminal vesicle involvement (p=0.024). Body mass index (BMI) was not predictive of BCR (p=0.32). In a multivariate model including seminal vesicle involvement, both a VAT volume above the median (HR2.5, 95%CI 1.1-5.7, p=0.03) and a VAT density (HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.1-5.1, p=0.028) above the median remained predictive for a better biochemical outcome. Adjusting for BMI did not significantly change the model.  Conclusions:   In both univariate and multivariate analysis, patients with both a larger VAT volume and density had a better biochemical outcome.

Procedures:   We evaluated the ability of SERRS nanoparticles to delineate lymph node metastases in an orthotopic prostate cancer mouse model using PC-3 cells transduced with mCherry fluorescent protein. Tumor-bearing mice (n = 6) and non-tumor-bearing control animals (n = 4) were injected intravenously with 30 fmol/g SERRS nanoparticles. After 16-18 h, the retroperitoneal lymph nodes were scanned in situ and ex vivo with a Raman imaging system and a handheld Raman scanner and data corroborated with fluorescence imaging for mCherry protein expression and histology.  Results:   The SERRS nanoparticles demonstrated avid homing to normal lymph nodes, but not to metastasized lymph nodes. In cases where lymph nodes were partially infiltrated by tumor cells, the SERRS signal correctly identified, with sub-millimeter precision, healthy from metastasized components.

Loss-of-function studies using human prostate cancer cells indicated direct involvement of MTA1 in inducing inflammation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MTA1 by pterostilbene resulted in decreased proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis. This restrained prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) formation in prostate-specific Pten heterozygous mice and reduced tumor development and progression in prostate-specific Pten-null mice.

In our previous study, we showed that the expression level of HBP1 was closely related to prostate cancer metastasis and prognosis, but the relationship between HBP1 and radioresistance for prostate cancer is largely unknown. In this study, the clinical data of patients with prostate cancer was compared, and the positive correlation was revealed between prostate cancer brachytherapy efficacy and the expression level of HBP1 gene. Through research on prostate cancer cells in vitro, we found that HBP1 expression levels were negatively correlated with oncogene expression levels. Furthermore, HBP1 overexpression could sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiation and increase apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In addition, animal model was employed to analyze the relationship between HBP1 gene and prostate cancer radiosensitivity in vivo; the result showed that knockdown of HBP1 gene could decrease the sensitivity to radiation of xenograft.

These variants may confer susceptibility to the development of specific molecular alterations during tumor initiation and progression. The TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion occurs in roughly 50% of prostate cancers. Genetic risk variants may influence the development of this fusion. We sought to determine whether prostate cancer risk variants are differentially associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive and negative cancer.  Methods:   In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study Tumor Cohort, we evaluated the associations of 39 prostate cancer risk SNPs with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status, measured by ERG protein expression. Logistic regression was performed to generate OR and 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcome was ERG(+) (n = 227) versus ERG(-) (n = 260) prostate cancer. A secondary outcome was ERG(+) or ERG(-) cancer versus controls without cancer.  Results:   Six of 39 SNPs were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with ERG(+) versus ERG(-) disease. Three SNPs were exclusively associated with the risk of ERG(+), one with risk of ERG(-), and two with associations trending in opposite directions for ERG(+) and ERG(-) Only two significant SNPs would be expected by chance.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer genetic risk variants are differentially associated with the development of ERG(+) and ERG(-) prostate cancer.  Impact:   Our findings suggest the molecular process of prostate carcinogenesis may be distinct for men with different underlying genetic predisposition.

The inverse problem in DOT is highly ill-posed, making reconstruction of high-quality image a critical challenge. Because of the nature of sparsity in DOT, sparsity regularization has been utilized to achieve high-quality DOT reconstruction. However, conventional approaches using sparse optimization are computationally expensive and have no selection criteria to optimize the regularization parameter. In this paper, a novel algorithm, Dimensionality Reduction based Optimization for DOT (DRO-DOT), is proposed. It reduces the dimensionality of the inverse DOT problem by reducing the number of unknowns in two steps and thereby makes the overall process fast. First, it constructs a low resolution voxel basis based on the sensing-matrix properties to find an image support. Second, it reconstructs the sparse image inside this support. To compensate for the reduced sensitivity with increasing depth, depth compensation is incorporated in DRO-DOT. An efficient method to optimally select the regularization parameter is proposed for obtaining a high-quality DOT image. DRO-DOT is also able to reconstruct high-resolution images even with a limited number of optodes in a spatially limited imaging set-up.""","""['Tanmoy Bhowmik', 'Hanli Liu', 'Zhou Ye', 'Soontorn Oraintara']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Back-propagation neural network-based reconstruction algorithm for diffuse optical tomography.', 'Optimizing the regularization for image reconstruction of cerebral diffuse optical tomography.', 'Compressive diffuse optical tomography: noniterative exact reconstruction using joint sparsity.', 'Overview of diffuse optical tomography and its clinical applications.', 'Time-resolved diffuse optical tomography and its application to in vitro and in vivo imaging.', 'Ultrafast and Ultrahigh-Resolution Diffuse Optical Tomography for Brain Imaging with Sensitivity Equation based Noniterative Sparse Optical Reconstruction (SENSOR).']"""

The database comprises two levels of annotation (i) global-specific data of oligosaccharides released and characterised from single purified glycoproteins and (ii) information pertaining to site-specific glycan heterogeneity. Additional, contextual information is provided including structural, bibliographic, and taxonomic information for each entry.  Methods:   Since the launch of UniCarbKB in 2012, we have continued to improve the organisation of our data model. Recently, we have extended our pipeline to collate structural and abundance changes of oligosaccharides in different human disease states and experimental models to extend our coverage of the human glycome.  Results:   In this manuscript, we demonstrate the capability of UniCarbKB to store and query relative glycan abundance data using a set of published colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines as examples. Furthermore, we outline our strategy for managing large-scale glycoproteomics data, site-specific and glycan compositional data, and how this information is adding value to UniCarbKB. Finally, we summarise our efforts to improve the efficient representation of disease terms and associated changes in glycan heterogeneity by integrating the Disease Ontology.  Conclusions:   Updates and improvements to UniCarbKB have introduced unique features for storing and displaying glycosylation features of mammalian glycoproteins. The integration of site-specific glycosylation data obtained from large-scale glycoproteomics and introduction of cell line studies will improve the analysis of glycoproteins and entire glycomes.

Main outcomes and measures:   Relative risks (RRs) for incident cancers and population-attributable risk (PAR).  Results:   Among the 88 084 women and 47 881 men who underwent follow-up for as long as 32 years, 20 414 cancers among women and 7571 cancers among men were documented. Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk for overall cancer (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), which was primarily owing to a lower incidence of gastrointestinal tract cancers (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91), especially colorectal cancers (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88). The benefit of aspirin on gastrointestinal tract cancers appeared evident with the use of at least 0.5 to 1.5 standard aspirin tablets per week; the minimum duration of regular use associated with a lower risk was 6 years. Among individuals older than 50 years, regular aspirin use could prevent 33 colorectal cancers per 100 000 person-years (PAR, 17.0%) among those who had not undergone a lower endoscopy and 18 colorectal cancers per 100 000 person-years (PAR, 8.5%) among those who had. Regular aspirin use was not associated with the risk for breast, advanced prostate, or lung cancer.  Conclusions and relevance:   Long-term aspirin use was associated with a modest but significantly reduced risk for overall cancer, especially gastrointestinal tract tumors. Regular aspirin use may prevent a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers and complement the benefits of screening.""","""['Yin Cao', 'Reiko Nishihara', 'Kana Wu', 'Molin Wang', 'Shuji Ogino', 'Walter C Willett', 'Donna Spiegelman', 'Charles S Fuchs', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Andrew T Chan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Incomplete Conflict of Interest Disclosures.', 'Long term aspirin may reduce overall cancer risk.', 'Aspirin and Cancer Risk-Reply.', 'Aspirin and Cancer Risk.', 'Aspirin and Cancer Risk.', 'Aspirin and Cancer Risk.', 'Aspirin and Cancer Risk.', 'Aspirin Use Associated with Reduced Risk of Cancer.', 'Omitted Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest in Articles Published in JAMA Oncology.', 'Long-term use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of colorectal cancer.', 'Association Between Aspirin Use and Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Aspirin dose and duration of use and risk of colorectal cancer in men.', 'Aspirin Use in Adults: Cancer, All-Cause Mortality, and Harms: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Aspirin Use on Incidence and Mortality of Gastrointestinal Cancers: Current State of Epidemiological Evidence.', 'The Effect of Acetylsalicylic Acid, as a Representative Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug, on the Activity of Myeloperoxidase.', 'Effects of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Gastroprotective NSAIDs on the Gastrointestinal Tract: A Narrative Review.', 'Young-onset colorectal cancer.', 'Aspirin increases the efficacy of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and reversing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.', 'Adequate vitamin D level associated with reduced risk of sporadic colorectal cancer.']"""

Here, we studied interactions between miR-185 and the bromodomain containing 8 isoform 2 (BRD8 ISO2) to investigate indirect mechanisms of miR-185 with respect to AR function through BRD8 ISO2 in PCa.  Methods:   Putative miRNA response element (MRE) of miR-185 in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of BRD8 ISO2 mRNA was predicted by software and confirmed using dual-luciferase assays and Ago2 immunoprecipitation. BRD8 and AR expression were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot in PCa cells and tissues. MMTV-Fluc reporter plasmids and dual-luciferase assays were used to evaluate AR activity.  Results:   MRE prediction, dual-luciferase assays and Ago2 immunoprecipitation confirmed that miR-185 is capable of binding the 3'-UTR of BRD8 ISO2 mRNA. QRT-PCR and Western blot indicated that BRD8 ISO2 expression is decreased by miR-185 mimic transfection while increased by miR-185 inhibitor transfection. MMTV-Fluc reporter assays revealed that miR-185 can attenuate AR function by suppressing BRD8 ISO2. Additionally, Pearson's correlation analyses confirmed that BRD8 ISO2 mRNA expression is inversely correlated with miR-185 expression in clinical specimens.  Conclusion:   In addition to suppression of AR expression, miR-185 can attenuate AR function indirectly by suppressing BRD8 ISO2.

Methods:   We stably transfected human cDNA of the GRPr bombesin (BBN) receptor subtype to canine Ace-1 prostate cancer cells (Ace-1(huGRPr) ). Expression was examined by (125) I-Tyr(4) -BBN competition, calcium stimulation assay, and fluorescent microscopy. A dual tumor nude mouse xenograft model was developed from Ace-1(CMV) (vector transfected Ace-1) and Ace-1(huGRPr) cells. The model was used to explore the in vivo behavior of two new IRDye800-labeled GRPr binding optical imaging agents: 800-G-Abz4-t-BBN, from a GRPr agonist peptide, and 800-G-Abz4-STAT, from a GRPr antagonist peptide, by imaging the tumor mice and dissected organs.  Results:   Both agents bound Ace-1(huGRPr) and PC-3, a known GRPr-expressing human prostate cancer cell line, with 4-13 nM IC50 against (125) I-Tyr(4) -BBN, but did not bind Ace-1(CMV) cells (vector transfected). Binding was blocked by bombesin. Ca(2+) activation assays demonstrated that Ace-1(huGPRr) expressed biologically active GRPr. Both Ace-1 cell lines grew in the flanks of 100% of the nude mice and formed tumors of ∼0.5 cm diameter in 1 week. In vivo imaging of the mice at 800 nm emission showed GRPr+: GRPr- tumor signal brighter by a factor of two at 24 h post IV administration of 10 nmol of the imaging agents. Blood retention (4-8% ID at 1 h) was greater by a factor >10 and cumulative urine accumulation (28-30% at 4 h) was less by a factor 2 compared to a radioactive analog of the t-BBN containing agent, (177) LuAMBA, probably due to binding to blood albumin, which we confirmed in a mouse serum assay.  Conclusions:   The dual tumor Ace-1(CMV) /Ace-1(huGRPr) model system provides a rapid test of specific to nonspecific binding of new GRPr avid agents in a model that will extend logically to the known Ace-1 orthotopic canine prostate cancer model.

Our objective was to determine the prognostic value of invasive cribriform and intraductal carcinoma in pre-treatment biopsies on time to disease-specific death. We pathologically revised the diagnostic biopsies of 1031 patients from the first screening round of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (1993-2000). Ninety percent of all patients (n=923) had received active treatment, whereas 10% (n=108) had been followed by watchful waiting. The median follow-up was 13 years. Patients who either had invasive cribriform growth pattern or intraductal carcinoma were categorized as CR/IDC+. The outcome was disease-specific survival. Relationships with outcome were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank analysis. In total, 486 patients had Gleason score 6 (47%) and 545 had ≥7 (53%). The 15-year disease-specific-survival probabilities were 99% in Gleason score 6 (n=486), 94% in CR/IDC- Gleason score ≥7 (n=356) and 67% in CR/IDC+ Gleason score ≥7 (n=189). CR/IDC- Gleason score 3+4=7 patients did not have statistically different survival probabilities from those with Gleason score 6 (P=0.30), while CR/IDC+ Gleason score 3+4=7 patients did (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, CR/IDC+ status was independently associated with a poorer disease-specific survival (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.8, P=0.002). We conclude that CR/IDC+ status in prostate cancer biopsies is associated with a worse disease-specific survival.

However, little is known about its role in prostate cancer. This study examined the effects of a heterologous GRPr agonist, bombesin (BBN), on growth, motility, morphology, gene expression, and tumor phenotype of an osteoblastic canine prostate cancer cell line (Ace-1) in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   The Ace-1 cells were stably transfected with the human GRPr and tumor cells were grown in vitro and as subcutaneous and intratibial tumors in nude mice. The effect of BBN was measured on cell proliferation, cell migration, tumor growth (using bioluminescence), tumor cell morphology, bone tumor phenotype, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis gene expression (quantitative RT-PCR). GRPr mRNA expression was measured in primary canine prostate cancers and normal prostate glands.  Results:   Bombesin (BBN) increased tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and invasion in vivo. BBN upregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (TWIST, SNAIL, and SLUG mRNA) and downregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin mRNA), and modified tumor cell morphology to a spindle cell phenotype. Blockade of GRPr upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated VIMENTIN and SNAIL mRNA. BBN altered the in vivo tumor phenotype in bone from an osteoblastic to osteolytic phenotype. Primary canine prostate cancers had increased GRPr mRNA expression compared to normal prostates.  Conclusion:   These data demonstrated that the GRPr is important in prostate cancer growth and progression and targeting GRPr may be a promising strategy for treatment of prostate cancer.

Methods:   The expression levels of Skp2 and AR in different PCa cell lines were detected by Western blot. After knockdown of Skp2 in the C4-2 and 22RV1 cells transfected with shRNA, the expressions of AR and P27 were determined and the activity of ARR3-Luc measured by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay following treatment with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The expressions of AR and Skp2 in human naïve PCa or CRPC specimens were detected by immunohistochemical staining followed by analysis of their differences and correlation.  Results:   The Skp2 protein expression level was significantly higher in the C4-2 or 22RV1 cells than in the LNCaP cells. DHT treatment increased the expression of Skp2 in the C4-2 cells, but knock-down of Skp2 significantly up-regulated the expression of the well-known downstream protein P27 and down-regulated that of AR. Consistently, DHT treatment increased the activity of ARR3-Luc, while knockdown of Skp2 remarkably decreased it in the C4-2 and 22RV1 cells (P < 0.05).

Objective:   The study of the lower urinary tract (LUT) by cystography in these patients, with a description of some other types of radiation lesions.  Methods:   127 cystographies have been performed (88 men and 39 women) in consecutive patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) (48 monotherapy and 79 cases combined with surgery), with a mean age of 69.6 years, and a mean time from radiation of 215 months (17 years). A General Electric X ray equipment has been used. We studied: behavior of the bladder neck at rest and during micturition, assessment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), bladder morphology (BM), urethral strictures (UE) and fistulas (F).  Results:   We observed: Filling phase bladder neck incompetence (BNI) (37.8%), bladder smooth morphology (60.6%), coughing urinary incontinence (UI) (26.4%), basal cystocele (64.7%) and Valsalva cystocele (96.6%), a normal opening bladder neck (96,1%), reduction of the urethral diameter during voiding (41.3%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (13.2%). Five cases of filling BNI, were all related to prostate cancer (PC) (one of them with colon cancer as well). There were six cases of fistulae (4.14%), five of them women. Forty two patients (28.96%) had reduced urethral lumen, thirty five of them affecting the posterior urethra (83%), five (11.9%) the anterior and, finally, two cases of mixed lesion (5%). 95% were patients with PC without concurrent interventions (67%). Significant differences were found regarding the gender and the background of pelvic surgery. The filling BNI (p=0.007), the irregular bladder morphology (p=0.004) and the reduction of the urethral lumen (p<0.001) have been found to be more common in male patients, while the coughing UI was more common in women (p=0.007). The study shows that BNI (p=0.046), VUR (p=0.02) and the IU due to cough (p=0.03) were more frequent in operated patients, while reduced urethral lumen was less common (p<0.01). Patients with VUR present more time from radiotherapy, but not in other cystography variables. There was a relationship between RT and the BNI, stress urinary incontinence, anterior urethral stricture and VUR. The risk factor was increased by surgery.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of acquired proliferation ability of tumor cells upon androgen deprivation are largely undetermined. In the present study, we identified that ubiquitin specific peptidase 39 (USP39) was significantly upregulated in PCa samples and cell lines. Elevated USP39 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score, predicted a poor outcome, and functioned as an independent risk factor for biochemical recurrence (BCR) especially in patients with a Gleason score ≤7. Our cell-based study showed that the expression level of USP39 was the highest in AR-negative PCa cell lines. Knockdown of USP39 in PCa cells inhibited cancer colony formation and tumor cell growth, and induced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis. Microarray analysis suggested that knockdown of USP39 caused a reduced expression of EGFR. Silencing of USP39 inhibited the expression of EGFR 3'-end, and presented a remarkable block to the maturation of EGFR mRNA, suggesting that silencing of USP39 decreased the transcriptional elongation and maturation of EGFR mRNA. Oncomine datasets analysis showed that USP39 expression was positively correlated with EGFR level.

The WP group experienced a significantly increased frequency of acute grade 2 diarrhoea relative to the PO group (5.9% vs 0%; p = 0.015). No differences were seen between the WP and PO groups in terms of acute grade 2 proctitis (10.1% vs 6.7%; p = 0.360) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity (12.6% vs 10.5%; p = 0.620).  Conclusion:   Despite larger rectum and bladder volumes at low- and medium-dose levels, WP VMAT resulted in no significant increase in acute proctitis or GU toxicity when compared with PO VMAT.

Coexisting TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3 rearrangements are found in a subset of cases, but the meaning is still unknown.  Methods:   SLC45A3-ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements and their association with ERG and PTEN expression and with clinical and pathological features have been analyzed in 80 PrCa (PSMAR-Biobank, Barcelona, Spain). ERG and PTEN mRNA were assessed by qRT-PCR; TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG by RT-PCR, FISH, and direct sequencing; and ERG expression by IHC. The endpoints were Gleason score (GS), stage, and PSA progression-free survival.  Results:   Single TMPRSS2-ERG was found in 51.6% GS ≤ 7 and 22.2% GS ≥ 8 tumors (P = 0.027). SLC45A3-ERG was found in 25 cases, 20 of them with concurrent TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement: 11.5% GS = 6, 22.2% GS = 7, and 50% GS ≥ 8 tumors (P = 0.013). Double rearrangements were associated with higher levels of ERG mRNA (P = 0.04). Double rearrangement plus PTEN loss was detected in 0% GS = 6; 14.7% GS = 7, and 29.4% GS ≥ 8 tumors (P = 0.032). Furthermore, this triple change was present in 19.2% stage T3-4 but not in any of stage T2 tumors (P = 0.05). No relationship was found with PSA progression-free survival.  Conclusions:   Single TMPRSS2-ERG translocation is associated with low grade PrCa. Subsequent development of SLC45A3-ERG results in higher ERG expression. The combination of double rearrangement plus PTEN loss, according to our series, is never found in low grade, low stage tumors. These findings could be potentially useful in therapeutic decision making in PrCa. Tumors with combined TMPRSS2-ERG/SLC45A3-ERG fusions plus PTEN loss should be excluded from watchful waiting and are candidates for intensive therapy.

In this study, we investigated whether circulating miR-21 and miR-152 can be used for early detection of lung cancer (LuCa), colorectal carcinoma (CRC), breast cancer (BrCa) and prostate cancer (PCa), with distinguishing cancer from various benign lesions on these organ sites. We measured the two miRNA levels by using real-time RT-PCR in plasma samples from a total of 204 cancer patients, 159 various benign lesions, and 228 normal subjects. We observed significantly elevated expression of miR-21 and miR-152 in LuCa, CRC, and BrCa when compared with normal controls. We also found upregulation of plasma miR-21 and miR-152 levels in patients with benign lesions of lung and breast, as compared to normal controls, respectively. No significant expression variation of the two miRNAs was observed in PCa or prostatic benign lesions as compared to healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed that miR-21 and/or miR-152 can discriminate LuCa, CRC and BrCa from normal controls.

To estimate the degree to which reimbursement influences physician decision making, we examined utilization of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists among urologists as Part B drug reimbursement varied in a fee-for-service environment.  Methods:   We analyzed treatment patterns of urologists treating 15,128 men included in SEER-linked Medicare claims who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003. We calculated a reimbursement generosity index to measure differences in GnRH agonist reimbursement among regional Medicare carriers and over time. We used multilevel analysis to control for patient and provider characteristics.  Results:   Among urologists treating early-stage and lower grade prostate cancer, variation in reimbursement was not associated with overuse of GnRH agonists from 2000 to 2003, a period of guideline stability (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.00).

A compelling therapeutic target is mesotrypsin, a protease up-regulated with tumour progression, associated with poor prognosis, and implicated in tumour growth and progression of many cancers. However, with its unique capability for cleavage and inactivation of proteinaceous inhibitors, mesotrypsin presents a formidable challenge to the development of biological inhibitors. We used a powerful yeast display platform for directed evolution, employing a novel multi-modal library screening strategy, to engineer the human amyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (APPI) simultaneously for increased proteolytic stability, stronger binding affinity and improved selectivity for mesotrypsin inhibition. We identified a triple mutant APPIM17G/I18F/F34V, with a mesotrypsin inhibition constant (Ki) of 89 pM, as the strongest mesotrypsin inhibitor yet reported; this variant displays 1459-fold improved affinity, up to 350 000-fold greater specificity and 83-fold improved proteolytic stability compared with wild-type APPI. We demonstrated that APPIM17G/I18F/F34V acts as a functional inhibitor in cell-based models of mesotrypsin-dependent prostate cancer cellular invasiveness. Additionally, by solving the crystal structure of the APPIM17G/I18F/F34V-mesotrypsin complex, we obtained new insights into the structural and mechanistic basis for improved binding and proteolytic resistance. Our study identifies a promising mesotrypsin inhibitor as a starting point for development of anticancer protein therapeutics and establishes proof-of-principle for a novel library screening approach that will be widely applicable for simultaneously evolving proteolytic stability in tandem with desired functionality for diverse protein scaffolds.""","""['Itay Cohen', 'Olumide Kayode', 'Alexandra Hockla', 'Banumathi Sankaran', 'Derek C Radisky', 'Evette S Radisky', 'Niv Papo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Pre-equilibrium competitive library screening for tuning inhibitor association rate and specificity toward serine proteases.', 'Disulfide engineering of human Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors enhances proteolytic stability and target affinity toward mesotrypsin.', 'Sequence and conformational specificity in substrate recognition: several human Kunitz protease inhibitor domains are specific substrates of mesotrypsin.', 'Biochemical and structural insights into mesotrypsin: an unusual human trypsin.', 'Phage display as a powerful tool to engineer protease inhibitors.', 'Avidity observed between a bivalent inhibitor and an enzyme monomer with a single active site.', 'Potent Inhibitor of Human Trypsins from the Aeruginosin Family of Natural Products.', 'Climbing Up and Down Binding Landscapes through Deep Mutational Scanning of Three Homologous Protein-Protein Complexes.', 'Generating quantitative binding landscapes through fractional binding selections combined with deep sequencing and data normalization.', 'PRSS3/Mesotrypsin and kallikrein-related peptidase 5 are associated with poor prognosis and contribute to tumor cell invasion and growth in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Localized prostate cancer treatment decision making is an advantageous model for studying patient treatment decision-making dynamics because there are multiple treatment options and a lack of empirical evidence to recommend one over the other; consequently, it is recommended that patients be fully involved in making the decision.  Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer (N = 1529) completed measures of decisional control, prostate cancer knowledge, and decision-making experiences (decisional conflict and decision-making satisfaction and difficulty) shortly after they made their treatment decision. Prostate cancer-specific QOL was assessed at 6 months after treatment.  Results:   More active involvement in decision making and greater knowledge were associated with lower decisional conflict and higher decision-making satisfaction but greater decision-making difficulty. An interaction between decisional control and knowledge revealed that greater knowledge was only associated with greater difficulty for men actively involved in making the decision (67% of sample). Greater knowledge, but not decisional control, predicted better QOL 6 months after treatment.  Conclusions:   Although men who are actively involved in decision making and more knowledgeable may make more informed decisions, they could benefit from decisional support (e.g., decision-making aids, emotional support from providers, strategies for reducing emotional distress) to make the process easier. Men who were more knowledgeable about prostate cancer and treatment side effects at the time that they made their treatment decision may have appraised their QOL as higher because they had realistic expectations about side effects.""","""['Heather Orom', 'Caitlin Biddle', 'Willie Underwood rd', 'Christian J Nelson', 'D Lynn Homish']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Decisional regret and quality of life after participating in medical decision-making for early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict?

There are only a few available treatments for CRPC, making the discovery of new drugs an urgent need. We report that CUDC-101 (an inhibitor od HER2/NEU, EGFR and HDAC) inhibits both the full length AR (flAR) and the AR variant AR-V7. This observation prompted experiments to discover which of the known activities of CUDC-101 is responsible for the inhibition of flAR/AR-V7 signaling. We used pharmacologic and genetic approaches, and found that the effect of CUDC-101 on flAR and AR-V7 was duplicated only by other HDAC inhibitors, or by silencing the HDAC isoforms HDAC5 and HDAC10. We observed that CUDC-101 treatment or AR-V7 silencing by RNAi equally reduced transcription of the AR-V7 target gene, PSA, without affecting viability of 22Rv1 cells. However, when cellular proliferation was used as an end point, CUDC-101 was more effective than AR-V7 silencing, raising the prospect that CUDC-101 has additional targets beside AR-V7. In support of this, we found that CUDC-101 increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and decreased that of the oncogene HER2/NEU. To determine if CUDC-101 reduces growth in a xenograft model of prostate cancer, this drug was given for 14 days to castrated male SCID mice inoculated with 22Rv1 cells. Compared to vehicle, CUDC-101 reduced xenograft growth in a statistically significant way, and without macroscopic side effects. These studies demonstrate that CUDC-101 inhibits wtAR and AR-V7 activity and growth of 22Rv1 cells in vitro and in vivo. These effects result from the ability of CUDC-101 to target not only HDAC signaling, which was associated with decreased flAR and AR-V7 activity, but multiple additional oncogenic pathways. These observations raise the possibility that treatment of CRPC may be achieved by using similarly multi-targeted approaches.""","""['Huiying Sun#', 'Sanjay N Mediwala#', 'Adam T Szafran#', 'Michael A Mancini', 'Marco Marcelli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Validation of histone deacetylase 3 as a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual inhibition of HDAC and EGFR signaling with CUDC-101 induces potent suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in anaplastic thyroid cancer.', 'Recruitment of miR-8080 by luteolin inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Concept of Hybrid Drugs and Recent Advancements in Anticancer Hybrids.', 'Potential of histone deacetylase inhibitors in the control and regulation of prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.', 'HDAC inhibitors with potential to overcome drug resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'Histone deacetylase 10, a potential epigenetic target for therapy.']"""

This study evaluates trends in birth rates among male cancer survivors and mortality rates of their offspring.  Methods:   From the Swedish Multi-generation Register and Cancer Register, we identified 84,752 men ≤70 years with a history of cancer, for which we calculated relative birth rates as compared to the background population(Standardized Birth Ratios, SBRs). We also identified 126,696 offspring of men who had cancer, and compared their risks of death to the background population(Standardized Mortality Ratio, SMRs). Independent factors associated with reduced birth rates and mortality rates were estimated with Poisson modelling.  Results:   Men with a history of cancer were 23 % less likely to father a child compared to the background population(SBR 0.77, 95 % Confidence Interval[CI] 0.75-0.79). Nulliparous men were significantly more likely to father a child after diagnosis (SBR 0.81, 95 % CI 0.79-0.83) compared to parous men (SBR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.66-0.74). Cancer site(prostate), onset of cancer during childhood or adolescence, parity status at diagnosis(parous), current age(>40 years) and a recent diagnosis were significant and independent predictors of a reduced probability of fathering a child after diagnosis. Of the 126,696 children born to men who have had a diagnosis of cancer, 2604(2.06 %) died during follow up.

Prostate cancer cells have preserved this ability to generate and export exosomes to the extracellular space. We previously demonstrated that human prostasomes have an ATP-forming capacity. In this study, we compared the capacity of extracellular vesicles (EVs) to generate ATP between normal seminal prostasomes and exosomes secreted by PC3 cells (PC3 exosomes), a prostate cancer cell line. Proteomic analyses identified enzymes of the glycolytic chain in both prostasomes and PC3 exosomes, and we found that both of them were capable of generating ATP when supplied with substrates. Notably, the net production of extracellular ATP was low for prostasomes due to a high ATPase activity contrary to an elevated net ATP level for PC3 exosomes because of their low ATPase activity. The uptake of the 2 types of EVs by normal prostate epithelial cells (CRL2221) and prostate cancer cells (PC3) was visualized and measured, demonstrating differential kinetics. Interestingly, this uptake was dependent upon an ongoing glycolytic flux involving extracellular ATP formation by EVs and/or intracellular ATP produced from the recipient cells.

Our previous documented findings indicated that treatment of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell with the ethanol extract isolated from the juice of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan could inhibit tumor cell. In this study we intended to uncover the molecular pathway underlying anti-cancer efficacy of Taiwan pomegranate fruit juice against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma.  Methods:   We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to find the de-regulated proteins. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm the results collected from proteomics study.  Results:   Comparative proteomics indicated that 20 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol extract-treated T24 cells with 19 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated proteins. These de-regulated proteins were involved in apoptosis, cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity and aerobic glycolysis. Further studies on signaling pathway demonstrated that ethanol extract treatment might inhibit urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell proliferation through restriction of PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway via profilin 1 up-regulation.

For further investigation of hypoxia-related changes, areas of certain hypoxia must be reliably detected within cancer tissues. Pimonidazole, a 2-nitroimindazole, accumulates in hypoxic tissue and can be easily visualized using immunohistochemistry.  Materials and methods:   To improve detection of highly hypoxic versus normoxic areas in prostate cancer, immunoreactivity of pimonidazole and a combination of known hypoxia-related proteins was used to create computational oxygen supply maps of prostate cancer. Pimonidazole was intravenously administered before radical prostatectomy in n = 15 patients, using the da Vinci robot-assisted surgical system. Prostatectomy specimens were immediately transferred into buffered formaldehyde, fixed overnight, and completely embedded in paraffin. Pimonidazole accumulation and hypoxia-related protein expression were visualized by immunohistochemistry. Oxygen supply maps were created using the normalized information from pimonidazole and hypoxia-related proteins.  Results:   Based on pimonidazole staining and other hypoxia.related proteins (osteopontin, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, and glucose transporter member 1) oxygen supply maps in prostate cancer were created. Overall, oxygen supply maps consisting of information from all hypoxia-related proteins showed high correlation and mutual information to the golden standard of pimonidazole. Here, we describe an improved computer-based ex vivo model for an accurate detection of oxygen supply in human prostate cancer tissue.

The reason for this is currently unknown. We now hypothesise that an initial treatment response that increases tumour hypoxia drives selection of more malignant tumours.  Methods:   The LNCaP prostate tumour xenografts were analysed for physiological (oxygen and vasculature) and genetic (PCR array) changes during longitudinal treatment with ADT (bicalutamide, 6 or 2 mg kg⁻¹ daily for 28 days).  Results:   Bicalutamide caused an immediate (within 24 h) dose-dependent fall in oxygenation in LNCaP-luc prostate tumours with a nadir of ≤ 0.1% oxygen within 3-7 days; this was attributed to a significant loss of tumour microvessels (window chamber study). The hypoxic nadir persisted for 10-14 days. During the next 7 days, tumours regrew, oxygenation improved and the vasculature recovered; this was inhibited by the VEGF inhibitor B20.4.1.1. Gene expression over 28 days showed marked fluctuations consistent with the physiological changes. Accompanying the angiogenic burst (day 21) was a particularly striking increase in expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) showed increases in mRNA and protein expression.

However, clinical application is limited by a common toxicity, BP-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. There is emerging evidence that BPs possess anticancer potential, but exploitation of these antiproliferative properties is limited by their toxicities. We previously reported the utility of a cationic amphipathic fusogenic peptide, RALA, to traffic anionic nucleic acids into various cell types in the form of cationic nanoparticles. We hypothesized that complexation with RALA could similarly be used to conceal a BP's hydroxyapatite affinity, and to enhance bioavailability, thereby improving anticancer efficacy. Incubation of RALA with alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, or zoledronate provoked spontaneous electrostatic formation of cationic nanoparticles that did not exceed 100 nm in diameter and that were stable over a range of temperatures and for up to 6 h. The nanoparticles demonstrated a pH responsiveness, possibly indicative of a conformational change, that could facilitate release of the BP cargo in the endosomal environment. RALA/BP nanoparticles were more potent anticancer agents than their free BP counterparts in assays investigating the viability of PC3 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Moreover, RALA complexation potentiated the tumor growth delay activity of alendronate in a PC3 xenograft model of prostate cancer.

A biotinylated Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) specific aptamer A10 and SURVIVIN-siRNA were then linked to STD protein to form the therapeutic complex.

Instillation of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate (HA-CS) represents replenishment therapy of the glycosaminoglycan layer. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HA-CS in men with symptomatic cystitis after RT for PCa.  Materials and methods:   Eighty consecutive men were treated with RT for PCa; 30 of these (37.5%) reported clinically relevant LUTS and associated bother as measured by the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index and Problem Index (ICSI/ICPI) Questionnaire 3 months after RT. Symptomatic patients received instillation therapy with HA-CS weekly for the first month and then at weeks 6, 8, and 12. All patients completed the ICSI/ICPI questionnaire before and after RT and at the end of HA-CS treatment.  Results:   HA-CS significantly reduced postradiation LUTS (P < .001) and bother (P = .006). Age, Gleason score, and radiation dose were the main determinants of worsening of LUTS after radiation (ICSI score baseline vs. postradiation: P = .047, .043, and .023). In multivariate analysis, only age influenced LUTS worsening after RT (P = .01). Age, radiation dose, and radiation toxicity were related to recovery of LUTS (ICSI score postradiation vs. post-HA-CS P = .041, P = .050, and P = .046). In multivariate analysis, no factor was statistically significant.  Conclusions:   A remarkable worsening of symptoms and bother was observed after RT.

The pathway enhances patient care by providing adequate information and support and optimizes efficiency by reducing length of stay and minimizing hospital visits. Our study assesses the pathway for patient satisfaction, co-ordination of care between disciplines, length of stay and readmission rates.  Method:   We analysed our database of all patients undergoing RARP with Robocare between July 2012 and December 2013 at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia (PMCC). Compliance, Length of Stay and Postoperative Course were analysed. Patient satisfaction was assessed.  Results:   Overall 124 patients underwent RARP with 105 (85%) being discharged day 1 post-op (mean 1.3 days). Post-operative support phone calls were received by >95% of patients. Thereafter, 74 patients (60%) were followed in the long-term follow-up phone clinic. Twenty-nine complications were identified of which 19 (66%) were resolved by the nurse specialist. Eighteen patients had psychologist, 44 sexual health and 44 physiotherapist referral. Patient satisfaction in 74 (60%) returned surveys revealed 71 (96%) being well/very well supported.  Conclusions:   The Robocare pathway is safe with high patient satisfaction. It contributes to reducing post-operative length of stay and readmission rates as well as the outpatient follow-up. A true multidisciplinary approach that is nurse-led likely improves care and outcomes for RARP patients and may lower impact on hospital resources.""","""['Emma Birch', 'Siska van Bruwaene', 'Wouter Everaerts', 'Kathryn Schubach', 'Matiu Bush', 'Mei Krishnasamy', 'Daniel A Moon', 'Jeremy Goad', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Declan G Murphy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""['Laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: an Australian single-surgeon series.', 'Comparison of 1-Year Health Care Costs and Use Associated With Open vs Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Exploring pathways towards improving patient experience of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP): assessing patient satisfaction and attitudes.', 'Outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in 2010.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'A nurse practitioner model for the assessment of suspected prostate cancer referrals is safe, cost and time efficient.', 'Nurse-led cancer care: A scope review of the past years (2003-2016).', 'Voice Enabled Framework to Support Post-Surgical Discharge Monitoring.']"""

Objective:   To report medium-term outcomes in men receiving primary whole-gland HIFU from a national multi-centre registry cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Five-hundred and sixty-nine patients at eight hospitals were entered into an academic registry.  Intervention:   Whole-gland HIFU (Sonablate 500) for primary nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Redo-HIFU was permitted as part of the intervention.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary failure-free survival outcome incorporated no transition to any of the following: (1) local salvage therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), (2) systemic therapy, (3) metastases, or (4) prostate cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and genitourinary function.  Results and limitations:   Mean age was 65 yr (47-87 yr). Median prostate-specific antigen was 7.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 4.4-10.2). National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease was 161 (28%), 321 (56%), and 81 (14%), respectively. One hundred and sixty three of 569 (29%) required a total of 185 redo-HIFU procedures. Median follow-up was 46 (interquartile range 23-61) mo. Failure-free survival at 5 yr after first HIFU was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64-74). This was 87% (95% CI: 78-93), 63% (95% CI: 56-70), and 58% (95% CI: 32-77) for National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Fifty eight of 754 (7.7%) had one urinary tract infection, 22/574 (2.9%) a recurrent urinary tract infection, 22/754 (3%) epididymo-orchitis, 227/754 (30%) endoscopic interventions, 1/754 (0.13%) recto-urethral fistula, and 1/754 (0.13%) osteitis pubis. Of 206 known to be pad-free pre-HIFU, 183/206 (88%) remained pad free, and of 236 with good baseline erectile function, 91/236 (39%) maintained good function. The main limitation is lack of long-term data.  Conclusions:   Whole-gland HIFU is a repeatable day-case treatment that confers low rates of urinary incontinence. Disease control at a median of just under 5 yr of follow-up demonstrates its potential as a treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Endoscopic interventions and erectile dysfunction rates are similar to other whole-gland treatments.  Patient summary:   In this report we looked at the 5-yr outcomes following whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for prostate cancer and found that cancer control was acceptable with a low risk of urine leakage. However, risk of erectile dysfunction and further operations was similar to other whole-gland treatments like surgery and radiotherapy.""","""['Louise Dickinson', 'Manit Arya', 'Naveed Afzal', 'Paul Cathcart', 'Susan C Charman', 'Andrew Cornaby', 'Richard G Hindley', 'Henry Lewi', 'Neil McCartan', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Senthil Nathan', 'Chris Ogden', 'Raj Persad', 'Jan van der Meulen', 'Shraddha Weir', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim U Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Medium-Term Outcomes after Whole-Gland High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer from a Multicentre Registry Cohort.', 'A Multicentre Study of 5-year Outcomes Following Focal Therapy in Treating Clinically Significant Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients.', 'Cancer Control Outcomes Following Focal Therapy Using High-intensity Focused Ultrasound in 1379 Men with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Multi-institute 15-year Experience.', 'Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.', 'Extended Focal Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer With High-Frequency Irreversible Electroporation: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.', 'The challenges in diagnosis and management of osteitis pubis: An algorithm based on current evidence.', 'Current Landscape of Sonodynamic Therapy for Treating Cancer.', 'A Review of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound in Urology.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the degree of adherence to these guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2003 and 2009, in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 14 180 patients were diagnosed with high-risk (T1-T2 with World Health Organization histologic grade 3) or locally advanced (T3-T4 with any histologic grade) prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Intervention:   Administration of RT-ADT versus RT alone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed the rate of adherence to guidelines with respect to use of RT-ADT in the overall population and after stratification according to stage-grade groupings (T1-T2 G3 vs T3-T4 any grade), age (66-69, 70-74, 75-79, ≥80 yr), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (0, 1, ≥2), and preexisting baseline cardiovascular (CV) disease. We depicted the rate of RT-ADT administration graphically over the study period. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the predictors of RT-ADT use.  Results and limitations:   RT-ADT rates and guideline adherence were 58-75%, with the highest rate (75%) in 2003 and the lowest (58%) in 2009. When stratified according to stage-grade groupings, age, CCI, and preexisting baseline CV disease, similar results were obtained. In multivariable analyses, year of diagnosis (p<0.001), patient age (p<0.001), stage-grade groupings (p<0.001), CCI (p=0.036), race (p<0.001), marital status (p<0.001), population density (p<0.001), and US regions (p<0.001) were independent predictors of RT-ADT use. The limitations of our study include age >65 yr and exclusive Medicare coverage.  Conclusions:   The rate of guideline adherence regarding the use of RT-ADT is suboptimal and decreases with time instead of increasing.  Patient summary:   This population-based study provides evidence of low adherence to international urologic guidelines regarding the combination of radiation therapy (RT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

Estimated number of new rare cancer cases yearly diagnosed (incidence), proportion of patients alive after diagnosis (survival), and estimated number of people still alive after a new cancer diagnosis (prevalence) are provided for about 200 different cancer entities.  Materials and methods:   Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population- based cancer registries (CRs), covering nowadays 52% of the Italian population. This monograph uses the AIRTUM database (January 2015), which includes all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). Data underwent standard quality checks (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and were checked against rare-cancer specific quality indicators proposed and published by RARECARE and HAEMACARE (www.rarecarenet.eu; www.haemacare.eu). The definition and list of rare cancers proposed by the RARECAREnet ""Information Network on Rare Cancers"" project were adopted: rare cancers are entities (defined as a combination of topographical and morphological codes of the ICD-O-3) having an incidence rate of less than 6 per 100,000 per year in the European population. This monograph presents 198 rare cancers grouped in 14 major groups. Crude incidence rates were estimated as the number of all new cancers occurring in 2000-2010 divided by the overall population at risk, for males and females (also for gender-specific tumours).The proportion of rare cancers out of the total cancers (rare and common) by site was also calculated. Incidence rates by sex and age are reported. The expected number of new cases in 2015 in Italy was estimated assuming the incidence in Italy to be the same as in the AIRTUM area. One- and 5-year relative survival estimates of cases aged 0-99 years diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in the AIRTUM database, and followed up to 31 December 2009, were calculated using complete cohort survival analysis. To estimate the observed prevalence in Italy, incidence and follow-up data from 11 CRs for the period 1992-2006 were used, with a prevalence index date of 1 January 2007. Observed prevalence in the general population was disentangled by time prior to the reference date (≤2 years, 2-5 years, ≤15 years). To calculate the complete prevalence proportion at 1 January 2007 in Italy, the 15-year observed prevalence was corrected by the completeness index, in order to account for those cancer survivors diagnosed before the cancer registry activity started. The completeness index by cancer and age was obtained by means of statistical regression models, using incidence and survival data available in the European RARECAREnet data.  Results:   In total, 339,403 tumours were included in the incidence analysis. The annual incidence rate (IR) of all 198 rare cancers in the period 2000-2010 was 147 per 100,000 per year, corresponding to about 89,000 new diagnoses in Italy each year, accounting for 25% of all cancer. Five cancers, rare at European level, were not rare in Italy because their IR was higher than 6 per 100,000; these tumours were: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma of larynx (whose IRs in Italy were 7 per 100,000), multiple myeloma (IR: 8 per 100,000), hepatocellular carcinoma (IR: 9 per 100,000) and carcinoma of thyroid gland (IR: 14 per 100,000). Among the remaining 193 rare cancers, more than two thirds (No. 139) had an annual IR <0.5 per 100,000, accounting for about 7,100 new cancers cases; for 25 cancer types, the IR ranged between 0.5 and 1 per 100,000, accounting for about 10,000 new diagnoses; while for 29 cancer types the IR was between 1 and 6 per 100,000, accounting for about 41,000 new cancer cases. Among all rare cancers diagnosed in Italy, 7% were rare haematological diseases (IR: 41 per 100,000), 18% were solid rare cancers. Among the latter, the rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system were the most common (23%, IR: 26 per 100,000), followed by epithelial tumours of head and neck (17%, IR: 19) and rare cancers of the female genital system (17%, IR: 17), endocrine tumours (13% including thyroid carcinomas and less than 1% with an IR of 0.4 excluding thyroid carcinomas), sarcomas (8%, IR: 9 per 100,000), central nervous system tumours and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity (5%with an IR equal to 6 and 5 per 100,000, respectively). The remaining (rare male genital tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; tumours of eye, IR: 0.7 per 100,000; neuroendocrine tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; embryonal tumours, IR: 0.4 per 100,000; rare skin tumours and malignant melanoma of mucosae, IR: 0.8 per 100,000) each constituted <4% of all solid rare cancers. Patients with rare cancers were on average younger than those with common cancers. Essentially, all childhood cancers were rare, while after age 40 years, the common cancers (breast, prostate, colon, rectum, and lung) became increasingly more frequent. For 254,821 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2008, 5-year RS was on average 55%, lower than the corresponding figures for patients with common cancers (68%). RS was lower for rare cancers than for common cancers at 1 year and continued to diverge up to 3 years, while the gap remained constant from 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. For rare and common cancers, survival decreased with increasing age. Five-year RS was similar and high for both rare and common cancers up to 54 years; it decreased with age, especially after 54 years, with the elderly (75+ years) having a 37% and 20% lower survival than those aged 55-64 years for rare and common cancers, respectively. We estimated that about 900,000 people were alive in Italy with a previous diagnosis of a rare cancer in 2010 (prevalence). The highest prevalence was observed for rare haematological diseases (278 per 100,000) and rare tumours of the female genital system (265 per 100,000). Very low prevalence (<10 prt 100,000) was observed for rare epithelial skin cancers, for rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity.  Comments:   One in four cancers cases diagnosed in Italy is a rare cancer, in agreement with estimates of 24% calculated in Europe overall. In Italy, the group of all rare cancers combined, include 5 cancer types with an IR>6 per 100,000 in Italy, in particular thyroid cancer (IR: 14 per 100,000).The exclusion of thyroid carcinoma from rare cancers reduces the proportion of them in Italy in 2010 to 22%. Differences in incidence across population can be due to the different distribution of risk factors (whether environmental, lifestyle, occupational, or genetic), heterogeneous diagnostic intensity activity, as well as different diagnostic capacity; moreover heterogeneity in accuracy of registration may determine some minor differences in the account of rare cancers. Rare cancers had worse prognosis than common cancers at 1, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis. Differences between rare and common cancers were small 1 year after diagnosis, but survival for rare cancers declined more markedly thereafter, consistent with the idea that treatments for rare cancers are less effective than those for common cancers. However, differences in stage at diagnosis could not be excluded, as 1- and 3-year RS for rare cancers was lower than the corresponding figures for common cancers. Moreover, rare cancers include many cancer entities with a bad prognosis (5-year RS <50%): cancer of head and neck, oesophagus, small intestine, ovary, brain, biliary tract, liver, pleura, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid and lymphatic leukaemia; in contrast, most common cancer cases are breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, which have a good prognosis. The high prevalence observed for rare haematological diseases and rare tumours of the female genital system is due to their high incidence (the majority of haematological diseases are rare and gynaecological cancers added up to fairly high incidence rates) and relatively good prognosis. The low prevalence of rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system was due to the low survival rates of the majority of tumours included in this group (oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and liver), regardless of the high incidence rate of rare epithelial cancers of these sites. This AIRTUM study confirms that rare cancers are a major public health problem in Italy and provides quantitative estimations, for the first time in Italy, to a problem long known to exist. This monograph provides detailed epidemiologic indicators for almost 200 rare cancers, the majority of which (72%) are very rare (IR<0.5 per 100,000).

Methods:   For patients with pT3a disease or higher and/or positive surgical margins, we examined post-RP radiotherapy administration across MUSIC practices. We excluded patients with <6 months follow-up, and those that failed to achieve a postoperative PSA nadir ⩽0.1. ART was defined as radiation administered within 1 year post RP, with all post-nadir PSA levels <0.1 ng ml(-1). Radiation administered >1 year post RP and/or after a post-nadir PSA ⩾0.1 ng ml(-1) was defined as SRT. We used claims data to externally validate radiation administration.  Results:   Among 2337 patients undergoing RP, 668 (28.6%) were at high risk of recurrence. Of these, 52 (7.8%) received ART and 56 (8.4%) underwent SRT. Patients receiving ART were younger (P=0.027), more likely to have a greater surgical Gleason sum (P=0.009), higher pathologic stage (P<0.001) and received treatment at the smallest and largest size practices (P=0.011). Utilization of both ART and SRT varied widely across MUSIC practices (P<0.001 and P=0.046, respectively), but practice-level rates of ART and SRT administration were positively correlated (P=0.003) with lower ART practices also utilizing SRT less frequently. Of the 88 patients not receiving ART and experiencing a PSA recurrence ⩾0.2 ng ml(-1), 38 (43.2%) progressed to a PSA ⩾0.5 ng ml(-1) and 20 (22.7%) to a PSA ⩾1.0 ng ml(-1) without receiving prior SRT. There was excellent concordance between registry and claims data κ=0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-1.0).  Conclusions:   Utilization of ART and SRT is infrequent and variable across urology practices in Michigan. Although early SRT is an alternative to ART, it is not consistently utilized in the setting of post-RP biochemical recurrence. Quality improvement initiatives focused on current postoperative radiotherapy administration guidelines may yield significant gains for this high-risk population.""","""['T M Morgan', 'S R Hawken', 'K R Ghani', 'D C Miller', 'F Y Feng', 'S M Linsell', 'J A Salisz', 'Y Gao', 'J E Montie', 'M L Cher']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Utilization of Salvage Radiation Therapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.', 'pT3R1 prostate cancer : Immediate or delayed radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy?.', 'Factors Affecting Robotic Partial Nephrectomy Conversion to Radical Nephrectomy: A Retrospective Multi-Institutional Analysis in the Michigan Urologic Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC).', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk Stratification of Prostate Cancer Through Quantitative Assessment of PTEN Loss (qPTEN).', 'Ensuring Consistent European-Wide Urological Care by the Use of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines: Can We Do Better.', 'Prediction of biochemical failure using prostate-specific antigen half-life in patients with adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, the prognostic significance of plasma fibrinogen has not been investigated in prostate cancer with hormonal therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate its roles in prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   A total of 290 patients who underwent ADT as first-line therapy for prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The fibrinogen level was measured at the time of diagnosis. Patients were categorized using a cutoff point of 3.225 g l(-1) according to a calculation by the receiver operating curve analysis. Correlations between the fibrinogen and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Meanwhile, univariable and multivariable cox regression analyses were performed to determine the associations of fibrinogen with progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Prognostic accuracy was evaluated with the Harrell concordance index.  Results:   Compared with patients with a lower fibrinogen level (<3.225 g l(-1)), patients with a higher fibrinogen level were more likely to have higher PSA, Gleason score, risk stratification and incidence of metastasis (P<0.05). Multivariable analyses identified hyperfibrinogen as an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio (HR)=2.000, P<0.001), CSS (HR=2.209, P=0.006) and OS (HR=1.965, P=0.009). The final models built by the addition of fibrinogen improved predictive accuracy (c-index: 0.750, 0.799 and 0.767) for PFS, CSS and OS compared with the clinicopathological base models (c-index: 0.730, 0.778 and 0.746), which included Gleason score and metastasis.  Conclusions:   The pretreatment plasma fibrinogen level was associated with tumor progression and might have a significant role in the prognosis of the prostate cancer patients treated with ADT. Thus, we recommend adding fibrinogen to traditional prognostic model, which may improve its predictive accuracy.""","""['Y Wang', 'W Yin', 'Z Wang', 'J Huang', 'J Pan', 'Y Zhu', 'F Xu', 'X Shao', 'J Sha', 'Y Cai', 'Q Liu', 'B Dong', 'W Xue', 'Y Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Platelet to lymphocyte ratio as an independent prognostic indicator for prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Pretreatment elevated prognostic nutritional index predicts a favorable prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and its relationship to survival beyond time to PSA nadir for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases after primary androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Gene Polymorphism-related Individual and Interracial Differences in the Outcomes of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic role of pretreatment plasma fibrinogen in patients with solid tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Utility of Inflammatory Serum Markers in the Assessment of Perioperative Morbidity after Radical Cystectomy for Bladder Cancer.', 'Combined Longitudinal Clinical and Autopsy Phenomic Assessment in Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Recommendations for Advancing Precision Medicine.', 'Elevated Serum FGG Levels Prognosticate and Promote the Disease Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Systemic Coagulation Markers Especially Fibrinogen Are Closely Associated with the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer in Patients Who Underwent Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Prognostic Significance of Preoperative Fibrinogen-to-Prealbumin Ratio in Patients with Stage I-III Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Surgical Resection: A Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

Methods:   We included 5,871 men with height measured at ages 7 and 13 years in the Copenhagen School Health Records Register who also had adult (50-65 years) height measured in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. Prostate cancer status was obtained through linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Direct and total effects of childhood height on prostate cancer risk were estimated from Cox regressions.  Results:   From 1996 to 2012, 429 prostate cancers occurred. Child and adult heights were positively and significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. When adjusted for adult height, height at age 7 years was no longer significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer. Height at 13 years was significantly and positively associated with prostate cancer risk even when adult height was adjusted for; per height z-score the hazard ratio was 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.32].

We investigate the impact of site of metastases on OS of a substantial sample of men with mCRPC who received docetaxel chemotherapy in nine phase III trials.  Patients and methods:   Individual patient data from 8,820 men with mCRPC enrolled onto nine phase III trials were combined. Site of metastases was categorized as lymph node (LN) only, bone with or without LN (with no visceral metastases), any lung metastases (but no liver), and any liver metastases.  Results:   Most patients had bone with or without LN metastases (72.8%), followed by visceral disease (20.8%) and LN-only disease (6.4%). Men with liver metastases had the worst median OS (13.5 months). Although men with lung metastases had better median OS (19.4 months) compared with men with liver metastases, they had significantly worse median survival duration than men with nonvisceral bone metastases (21.3 months). Men with LN-only disease had a median OS of 31.6 months. The pooled hazard ratios for death in men with lung metastases compared with men with bone with or without LN metastases and in men with any liver metastases compared with men with lung metastases were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.25; P = .007) and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.35 to 1.73; P < .0001), respectively.  Conclusion:   Specific sites of metastases in men with mCRPC are associated with differential OS, with successive increased lethality for lung and liver metastases compared with bone and nonvisceral involvement.

We developed a method to capture and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTC) expressing c-MET using a ferromagnetic antibody. Immunofluorescence was used to characterize cells for c-MET, DAPI, and pan-CK, excluding CD45(+) leukocytes. The assay was validated using appropriate cell line controls spiked into peripheral blood collected from healthy volunteers (HV). In addition, peripheral blood was analyzed from patients with metastatic gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, renal, or prostate cancers. CTCs captured by c-MET were enumerated, and DNA FISH for MET amplification was performed. The approach was highly sensitive (80%) for MET-amplified cells, sensitive (40%-80%) for c-MET-overexpressed cells, and specific (100%) for both c-MET-negative cells and in 20 HVs. Of 52 patients with metastatic carcinomas tested, c-MET CTCs were captured in replicate samples from 3 patients [gastric, colorectal, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] with 6% prevalence. CTC FISH demonstrated that MET amplification in both gastric and colorectal cancer patients and trisomy 7 with gain of MET gene copies in the RCC patient. The c-MET CTC assay is a rapid, noninvasive, sensitive, and specific method for detecting MET-amplified tumor cells. CTCs with MET amplification can be detected in patients with gastric, colorectal, and renal cancers.

In the present study, human glioma (T98G and U-87MG) and prostate cancer (PC-3) cells were titrated with different concentrations of the protonophore CCCP to induce maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) within respirometers in a conventional growth medium. The results demonstrate that the presence of oligomycin or its A-isomer leads to underestimation of maximal ETS capacity. In the presence of oligomycin, the spare respiratory capacity (SRC), i.e., the difference between the maximal and basal cellular OCR, was underestimated by 25 to 45%. The inhibitory effect of oligomycin on SRC was more pronounced in T98G cells and was observed in both suspended and attached cells. Underestimation of SRC also occurred when oxidative phosphorylation was fully inhibited by the ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin. Further experiments indicated that oligomycin cannot be replaced by the adenine nucleotide translocase inhibitors bongkrekic acid or carboxyatractyloside because, although these compounds have effects in permeabilized cells, they do not inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in intact cells. We replaced CCCP by FCCP, another potent protonophore and similar results were observed. Lower maximal OCR and SRC values were obtained with the weaker protonophore 2,4-dinitrophenol, and these parameters were not affected by the presence of oligomycin. In permeabilized cells or isolated brain mitochondria incubated with respiratory substrates, only a minor inhibitory effect of oligomycin on CCCP-induced maximal OCR was observed. We conclude that unless a previously validated protocol is employed, maximal ETS capacity in intact cells should be estimated without oligomycin. The inhibitory effect of an ATP synthase blocker on potent protonophore-induced maximal OCR may be associated with impaired metabolism of mitochondrial respiratory substrates.""","""['Juliana S Ruas', 'Edilene S Siqueira-Santos', 'Ignacio Amigo', 'Erika Rodrigues-Silva', 'Alicia J Kowaltowski', 'Roger F Castilho']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['High glycolytic activity of tumor cells leads to underestimation of electron transport system capacity when mitochondrial ATP synthase is inhibited.', 'Evaluation of mitochondrial respiratory function in highly glycolytic glioma cells reveals low ADP phosphorylation in relation to oxidative capacity.', 'A dataset describing glycolytic inhibitors overcoming the underestimation of maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in oligomycin-treated cells.', 'Assaying Mitochondrial Respiration as an Indicator of Cellular Metabolism and Fitness.', 'Mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity: Mechanisms, regulation, and significance in non-transformed and cancer cells.', 'IGFBP7 Fuels the Glycolytic Metabolism in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia by Sustaining Activation of the IGF1R-Akt-GLUT1 Axis.', 'Proliferating Astrocytes in Primary Culture Do Not Depend upon Mitochondrial Respiratory Complex I Activity or Oxidative Phosphorylation.', 'Metabolic Heterogeneity of Cerebral Cortical and Cerebellar Astrocytes.', 'On-chip analysis of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in human induced pluripotent stem cells.', 'Sex as Biological Variable in Cardiac Mitochondrial Bioenergetic Responses to Acute Stress.']"""

Design:   We conducted a case-cohort study including a 5% sample of U.S. Medicare enrollees and all cancer cases aged at least 65 in linked cancer registries.  Methods:   HIV was identified through Medicare claims. Among the HIV-infected, absolute cancer risk was calculated accounting for the competing risk of death. Associations between HIV and cancer were estimated with weighted Cox regression adjusting for demographic characteristics.  Results:   Among 469 954 people in the 5% sample, 0.08% had an HIV diagnosis. Overall, 825 776 cancer cases were identified in cancer registries. Over 5 years, 10.1% of the HIV-infected elderly developed cancer, the most common diagnoses comprising lung (5-year cumulative incidence=2.2%), prostate (2.7%, among men), and colorectal cancer (0.9%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.8%). HIV was strongly associated with incidence of Kaposi sarcoma [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=94.4, 95% confidence interval (95%CI)=54.6-163], anal cancer (aHR=34.2, 95%CI=23.9-49.0) and Hodgkin lymphoma (aHR=6.3, 95%CI=2.8-14.3). HIV was also associated with incidence of liver cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer (aHR=3.4, 2.6, and 1.6, respectively).  Conclusion:   In the elderly, HIV infection is associated with higher risk for many cancers, although some associations were weaker than expected, perhaps reflecting effects of non-HIV pathways on cancer development. Due to the effects of HIV and aging, the HIV-infected elderly have a sizeable absolute risk, highlighting a need for cancer prevention.""","""['Elizabeth L Yanik', 'Hormuzd A Katki', 'Eric A Engels']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""AIDS""","""['Cancer risk in HIV-infected people in the USA from 1996 to 2012: a population-based, registry-linkage study.', 'Cancer risk in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: associations with immunodeficiency, smoking, and highly active antiretroviral therapy.', 'Cancer Risk in Older Persons Living With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in the United States.', 'Evolving epidemiology of HIV-associated malignancies.', ""HIV infection and cancers other than non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma."", 'RNA-seq analysis identifies transcriptomic profiles associated with anal cancer recurrence among people living with HIV.', 'The Association Of HIV With Health Care Spending And Use Among Medicare Beneficiaries.', 'Incidence of cervical, breast and colorectal cancers between 2010 and 2015 in people living with HIV in France.', 'Optimal Lung Cancer Screening Criteria Among Persons Living With HIV.', 'Older HIV-infected adults: complex patients-comorbidity (I).']"""

The purpose of this study was to decide whether non-toxicological levels of water extract of GST (WEGST) are effective in inhibiting the progress of prostate cancer formation and to identify the target molecule involved in the WEGST-mediated inhibitory process of prostate cancer cell migration and in vivo tumor formation. Through the Boyden chamber migration assay, we found that non-toxic levels of WEGST could not attenuate the PC3 migration to the bottom area coated with serum but significantly inhibited PC3 cell migration to the collagen-coated bottom area. We also found that non-toxic levels of WEGST significantly attenuated collagen against adhesion. Interestingly, ectopic administration of WEGST could not affect the expression of α2β1 integrin, which is known as a receptor of collagen. However, when the PC3 cells adhered to a collagen-coated plate, the expression of α2 integrin but not that of β1 integrin was significantly inhibited by the administration of non-toxic levels of WEGST, leading to the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, oral administration of WEGST (25 mg/kg/day) significantly inhibited the size of a PC3 cell-xenografted tumor. Taken together, these results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for WEGST to inhibit prostate cancer progression at particular stages, such as collagen-mediated adhesion and migration, and it might provide further development for the therapeutic use of WEGST in the treatment of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Sujin Ryu', 'Ki Moon Park', 'Seung Ho Lee']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Smilax glabra Roxb.

Material and method:   Cell survival is studied via cell viability assays (MTT) for 2 cell lines in isolated and combined treatments with zoledronic acid and/or IR, as well as the effect of adding 3 antioxidant substances.  Results:   Zoledronic acid displays a significant cytotoxic effect over PNT2 and TRAMP-C1 cells (P<.001). The administration of antioxidants together with the zoledronic acid shows a protective effect for normal prostate cells, yet not so for prostate tumour cells. However, the administration of rosmarinic acid and apigenin in treatments combined with zoledronic acid provides a protective effect from the harmful effects of applying ionizing radiation, not only for normal PNT2 cells, but also for tumour cells.  Conclusion:   The use of antioxidant substances decreases the cytotoxic effect of zoledronic acid over non-tumour cells, and as such could be used in benign diseases.

Selection is hampered by a lack of predictive factors for cancer control. This study aims to develop and internally validate a prognostic model for biochemical failure (BF) after salvage (125)I brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Whole-gland salvage (125)I brachytherapy patients were treated between 1993 and 2010 in two radiotherapy centers in the Netherlands. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to assess the predictive value of clinical parameters related to BF (Phoenix-definition [prostate-specific antigen [PSA]-nadir + 2.0 ng/mL]). Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. The model's discriminatory ability was assessed with Harrell's C-statistic. Internal validation was performed using bootstrap resampling (2000 data sets). Goodness-of-fit was evaluated with calibration plots. All analyses were performed using the recently published TRIPOD (Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement.  Results:   After median followup of 74 months (range 5-138), 43 of a total 62 patients developed BF. In multivariable analysis, disease-free survival interval (DFSI) after primary therapy and pre-salvage prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) were predictors of BF: corrected hazard ratio (HR) 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.97-0.999; p = 0.04) and 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.89-0.99; p = 0.03), both for a 1-month increase (optimism-adjusted C-statistic 0.70). Calibration was accurate up to 36 months. Of patients with PSADT >30 months and DFSI >60 months, 36-month biochemical disease-free survival was >75%. Every 12-month increase in DFSI will allow 3-month decrease in PSADT while maintaining the same biochemical recurrence-free rates.

However, randomised controlled trial data are limited. The 'Prostate Cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial' investigates the feasibility of recruiting and randomising men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer and eligible for radical prostatectomy to interventions that modify nutrition and physical activity. The primary outcomes are randomisation rates and adherence to the interventions at 6 months following randomisation. The secondary outcomes are intervention tolerability, trial retention, change in prostate specific antigen level, change in diet, change in general physical activity levels, insulin-like growth factor levels, and a range of related outcomes, including quality of life measures.  Methods/design:   The trial is factorial, randomising men to both a physical activity (brisk walking or control) and nutritional (lycopene supplementation or increased fruit and vegetables with reduced dairy consumption or control) intervention. The trial has two phases: men are enrolled into a cohort study prior to radical prostatectomy, and then consented after radical prostatectomy into a randomised controlled trial. Data are collected at four time points (cohort baseline, true trial baseline and 3 and 6 months post-randomisation).

Its detection in blood samples of metastatic resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients may indicate the presence of circulating tumour cells with this genetic alteration and may predict taxane resistance. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated TMPRSS2-ERG expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumour tissue from mCPRC patients treated with taxanes. We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 24 healthy controls, 50 patients treated with docetaxel, and 22 with cabazitaxel. TMPRSS2-ERG was detected in 0%, 16%, and 22.7% of them, respectively. In docetaxel-treated patients TMPRSS2-ERG detection correlated with lower prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (12.5% vs 68.3%, p=0.005), PSA-progression-free survival (PFS; 3.1 mo vs 7.5 mo, p<0.001), clinical/radiological-PFS (3.1 mo vs 8.2 mo, p<0.001), and it was independently associated with PSA-PFS (hazard ratio 3.7; p=0.009) and clinical/radiological-PFS (hazard ratio 6.3; p<0.001). Moreover, TMPRSS2-ERG also predicted low PSA-PFS to cabazitaxel. At progression, a switch from negative to positive TMPRSS2-ERG was observed in 41% of patients with undetected TMPRSS2-ERG at the baseline sample. Tissue TMPRSS2-ERG expression correlated with lower PSA-PFS (p=0.02) to docetaxel. Our findings support the potential role of TMPRSS2-ERG detection as a biomarker to tailor treatment strategies.  Patient summary:   Taxanes are the most active chemotherapy agents in metastatic resistant prostate cancer. However, not all patients respond to this therapy.

This planning concept is based on a hierarchical sequence of local dose modification and recovery operations. The purpose of this work is to provide a feasibility study for the IDS planning strategy based on a small set of six prostate patients. The IDS planning paradigm aims to perform interactive local dose adaptations of an IMRT plan without compromising already established valuable dose features in real-time. Various IDS tools were developed in our in-house treatment planning software Dynaplan and were utilized to create IMRT treatment plans for six patients with an adeno-carcinoma of the prostate. The sequenced IDS treatment plans were compared to conventionally optimized clinically approved plans (9 beams, co-planar). For each patient, several IDS plans were created, with different trade-offs between organ sparing and target coverage. The reference dose distributions were imported into Dynaplan. For each patient, the IDS treatment plan with a similar or better trade-off between target coverage and OAR sparing was selected for plan evaluation, guided by a physician. For this initial study we were able to generate treatment plans for prostate geometries in 15-45 min. Individual local dose adaptations could be performed in less than one second. The average differences compared to the reference plans were for the mean dose: 0.0 Gy (boost) and 1.2 Gy (PTV), for D98% : -1.1 Gy and for D2% : 1.1 Gy (both target volumes). The dose-volume quality indicators were well below the Quantec constraints. However, we also observed limitations of our currently implemented approach. Most prominent was an increase of the non-tumor integral dose by 16.4% on average, demonstrating that further developments of our planning strategy are required.""","""['Cornelis Ph Kamerling', 'Peter Ziegenhein', 'Florian Sterzing', 'Uwe Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A feasibility study of automated inverse treatment planning for cancer of the prostate.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for pancreatic and prostate cancer using pulsed low-dose rate delivery techniques.', 'Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Interactively exploring optimized treatment plans.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Real-time interactive planning for radiotherapy of head and neck cancer with volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Novel adaptive beam-dependent margins for additional OAR sparing.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'A novel probabilistic approach to generating PTV with partial voxel contributions.', 'Real-time 4D dose reconstruction for tracked dynamic MLC deliveries for lung SBRT.']"""

Results:   We assessed a total of 50 patients, with a mean age of 63 years (range, 45-79), a mean prostate-specific antigen level of 8 ng/mL (range, 1.9-20) and a mean prostate volume of 52mL (range, 12-118). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 69% of the patients and intraepithelial neoplasia in 6%. The results of the biopsy were negative for 24% of the patients. The results of the biopsy and MRI were in agreement for 62% of the patients; however, 46% also had a tumour outside of the suspicious lesion. We diagnosed 46% anterior tumours and 33% apical tumours. One patient had a haematuria, another had a haematoma and a third had acute urine retention.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric prostatic MRI helps identify prostate lesions suggestive of cancer. The Biopsee echo-MRI fusion system provides for guided biopsy and increases the diagnostic performance, reducing the false negatives of classical biopsies and increasing the diagnosis of anterior tumours. Transperineal access minimises the risk of prostatic infection and sepsis.""","""['E Romero-Selas', 'V Cuadros', 'J Montáns', 'E Sánchez', 'J M López-Alcorocho', 'F Gómez-Sancha']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Initial experience of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion transperineal biopsy: Biopsy techniques and results for 75 patients.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-directed transperineal limited-mapping prostatic biopsies to diagnose prostate cancer: a Scottish experience.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Recent Advances and Current Role of Transperineal Prostate Biopsy.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate hypofractionated schedules in the treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Between 2011-2014, 158 patients were treated using the RapidArc technique with IGRT. The target volume for low risk patients was the prostate alone with a prescribed dose of 20x3.0 Gy (EQD2=77 Gy). Targets volumes for intermediate and high risk patients were prostate and two thirds of the seminal vesicles with a prescribed dose 21-22x3.0/2.1 Gy (EQD2=81/45.4-84.9/47.5). Based on radiobiological modelling of early toxicity, we used four fractions per week in the low risk group and four fractions in odd weeks and three fractions in even weeks in intermediate and high risk groups. The RTOG/EORTC toxicity scale was used.  Results:   Early genitourinary (GU) toxicity was observed for grades 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 73 (46%), 60 (38%), 22 (14%), 0 and 3 (2%), respectively; early gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was recorded for grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 in 119 (75%), 37 (23%), and 2 (1%) patients, respectively.

Prostate orthotopic mouse model has been widely used to study human CaP in preclinical settings. Measurement of changes in tumor size obtained from noninvasive diagnostic images is a standard method for monitoring responses to anticancer modalities. This article reports for the first time the usage of a three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound system equipped with photoacoustic (PA) imaging in monitoring longitudinal prostate tumor growth in a PC-3 orthotopic NODSCID mouse model (n = 8). Two-dimensional and 3D modes of ultrasound show great ability in accurately depicting the size and shape of prostate tumors. PA function on two-dimensional and 3D images showed average oxygen saturation and average hemoglobin concentration of the tumor. Results showed a good fit in representative exponential tumor growth curves (n = 3; r(2) = 0.948, 0.955, and 0.953, respectively) and a good correlation of tumor volume measurements performed in vivo with autopsy (n = 8, r = 0.95, P < .001). The application of 3D ultrasound imaging proved to be a useful imaging modality in monitoring tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model, with advantages such as high contrast, uncomplicated protocols, economical equipment, and nonharmfulness to animals. PA mode also enabled display of blood oxygenation surrounding the tumor and tumor vasculature and angiogenesis, making 3D ultrasound imaging an ideal tool for preclinical cancer research.""","""['Jie Ni', 'Paul Cozzi', 'Tzong-Tyng Hung', 'Jingli Hao', 'Peter Graham', 'Yong Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['A new three-dimensional ultrasound microimaging technology for preclinical studies using a transgenic prostate cancer mouse model.', 'In Vivo 3D MRI Measurement of Tumour Volume in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'The use of three-dimensional ultrasound micro-imaging to monitor prostate tumor development in a transgenic prostate cancer mouse model.', 'The latest in ultrasound: three-dimensional imaging.

Objective:   To describe the effect of potential predictors on EF recovery after nsRP by post hoc decision-tree modeling of data from A Study of Tadalafil After Radical Prostatectomy (REACTT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled trial in 423 men aged <68 yr with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason ≤7, normal preoperative EF) who underwent nsRP at 50 centers from nine European countries and Canada.  Intervention:   Postsurgery 1:1:1 randomization to 9-mo double-blind treatment with tadalafil 5mg once a day (OaD), tadalafil 20mg on demand, or placebo, followed by a 6-wk drug-free-washout, and a 3-mo open-label tadalafil OaD treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Three decision-tree models, using the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) domain score at the end of double-blind treatment, washout, and open-label treatment as response variable. Each model evaluated the association between potential predictors: presurgery IIEF domain and IIEF single-item scores, surgical approach, nerve-sparing score (NSS), and postsurgery randomized treatment group.  Results and limitations:   The first decision-tree model (n=422, intention-to-treat population) identified high presurgery sexual desire (IIEF item 12: ≥3.5 and <3.5) as the key predictor for IIEF-EF at the end of double-blind treatment (mean IIEF-EF: 14.9 and 11.1), followed by high confidence to get and maintain an erection (IIEF item 15: ≥3.5 and <3.5; IIEF-EF: 15.4 and 7.1). For patients meeting these criteria, additional non-IIEF-related predictors included robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (yes or no; IIEF-EF: 19.3 and 12.6), quality of nerve sparing (NSS: <2.5 and ≥2.5; IIEF-EF: 14.3 and 10.5), and treatment with tadalafil OaD (yes and no; IIEF-EF: 17.6 and 14.3). Additional analyses after washout and open-label treatment identified high presurgery intercourse satisfaction as the key predictor.  Conclusions:   Exploratory decision-tree analyses identified high presurgery sexual desire, confidence, and intercourse satisfaction as key predictors for EF recovery. Patients meeting these criteria might benefit the most from conserving surgery and early postsurgery EF rehabilitation. Strategies for improving EF after surgery should be discussed preoperatively with all patients; this information may support expectation management for functional recovery on an individual patient level.  Patient summary:   Understanding how patient characteristics and different treatment options affect the recovery of erectile function (EF) after radical surgery for prostate cancer might help physicians select the optimal treatment for their patients. This analysis of data from a clinical trial suggested that high presurgery sexual desire, sexual confidence, and intercourse satisfaction are key factors predicting EF recovery. Patients meeting these criteria might benefit the most from conserving surgery (robot-assisted surgery, perfect nerve sparing) and postsurgery medical rehabilitation of EF.

The inability to identify and grade clinically significant PCa lesions is a factor contributing to excessively aggressive PCa treatment, such as radical prostatectomy, instead of more focal, prostate-sparing procedures such as cryotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy. We have performed 3-D in vivo B-mode and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging using a mechanically rotated, side-fire endorectal imaging array to identify regions suspicious for PCa in 29 patients being treated with radical prostatectomies for biopsy-confirmed PCa. Whole-mount histopathology analyses were performed to identify regions of clinically significant/insignificant PCa lesions, atrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Regions of suspicion for PCa were reader-identified in ARFI images based on boundary delineation, contrast, texture and location. These regions of suspicion were compared with histopathology identified lesions using a nearest-neighbor regional localization approach. Of all clinically significant lesions identified on histopathology, 71.4% were also identified using ARFI imaging, including 79.3% of posterior and 33.3% of anterior lesions. Among the ARFI-identified lesions, 79.3% corresponded to clinically significant PCa lesions, with these lesions having higher indices of suspicion than clinically insignificant PCa. ARFI imaging had greater sensitivity for posterior versus anterior lesions because of greater displacement signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial sampling. Atrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause appreciable prostate anatomy distortion and heterogeneity that confounds ARFI PCa lesion identification; however, in general, ARFI regions of suspicion did not coincide with these benign pathologies.""","""['Mark L Palmeri', 'Tyler J Glass', 'Zachary A Miller', 'Stephen J Rosenzweig', 'Andrew Buck', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Rajan T Gupta', 'Alison F Brown', 'John Madden', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Characterizing stiffness of human prostates using acoustic radiation force.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates: initial in vivo demonstration.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates ex vivo.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) for differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules--A meta-analysis.', 'Multiparametric transrectal ultrasound for the diagnosis of peripheral zone prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer: novel scoring systems.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection Using 3-D Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging.', 'Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Displacement Estimation in ARFI Imaging.', 'Design, Development, and Multi-Characterization of an Integrated Clinical Transrectal Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Device for Human Prostate Imaging.', 'Differential diagnosis of <3 cm renal tumors by ultrasonography: a rapid, quantitative, elastography self-corrected contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging mode beyond screening.']"""

One of the key aims of the audit was to assess the configuration and availability of specialist prostate cancer services in England.  Materials and methods:   In 2014, the NPCA undertook an organisational survey of all 143 acute National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and 48 specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) hubs cross England. Questionnaires established the availability and location of core diagnostic, treatment and patient-centred support services for the management of non-metastatic prostate cancer in addition to specific diagnostic and treatment procedures that reflect the continuing evolution of prostate cancer management, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and stereotactic body radiotherapy.  Results:   The survey received a 100% response rate. The results showed considerable geographical variation with respect to the availability of core treatment modalities, the size of the target population and catchment areas served by specialist MDT hubs, as well as in the uptake of additional procedures and services. Specifically there are gaps in the availability of core radiotherapy procedures; high dose rate and low dose rate brachytherapy are available in 44% and 75% of specialist MDTs, respectively. By comparison, there seems to be a relative 'over-penetration' of surgical innovation, with 67% of specialist MDTs providing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and 21% HIFU. There is also evidence of increased centralisation of core surgical procedures and regional inequity in the availability of surgical innovation across England.  Conclusions:   The organisational survey of the NPCA has provided a comprehensive assessment of the structure and function of specialist MDTs in England and the availability of prostate cancer procedures and services. As part of the prospective audit, the NPCA will assess the effect of the availability of prostate cancer services on access regionally and subsequent outcomes of care according to evidence-based guidelines.""","""['A Aggarwal', 'J Nossiter', 'P Cathcart', 'J van der Meulen', 'J Rashbass', 'N Clarke', 'H Payne']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Impact of cancer service centralisation on the radical treatment of men with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer: A national cross-sectional analysis in England.', 'Practicalities, challenges and solutions to delivering a national organisational survey of cancer service and processes: Lessons from the National Prostate Cancer Audit.', 'Operating a patient medicines helpline: a survey study exploring current practice in England using the RE-AIM evaluation framework.', 'Public reporting of outcomes in radiation oncology: the National Prostate Cancer Audit.', 'Where should paediatric surgery be performed?', 'Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.', 'Simulating the impact of centralization of prostate cancer surgery services on travel burden and equity in the English National Health Service: A national population based model for health service re-design.', 'Impact of cancer service centralisation on the radical treatment of men with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer: A national cross-sectional analysis in England.', 'Effect of patient choice and hospital competition on service configuration and technology adoption within cancer surgery: a national, population-based study.', 'Hospital Quality Factors Influencing the Mobility of Patients for Radical Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy: A National Population-Based Study.']"""

The role of heart healthy sports""","""30 years of organized ambulatory heart sport in Luxembourg Promoter of health sports. For more than 30 years both mortality and morbidity due to coronary artery disease (CAD) are significantly decreasing (> 70%) in the western world. This achievement is due to multiple interventions in the direct treatment of CAD and, especially, in fighting its risk factors: smoking, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and physical inactivity. In 1984 the first ambulatory heart sport group (phase 3 of cardiac reeducation) was founded in Luxembourg City, followed in 1991 by a section in Esch/Alzette and in 2002 by a 3ème section in Ettelbrück. These phase 3 cardiac sport groups (= chronic phase) are organized by some committed patients working on a voluntary basis and performing a professional job. Paradoxically these phase 3 groups preceded the phases 1 and 2 (= ""in hospital"" and subacute) of cardiac rehabilitation. However, in a parallel way ambulatory phase 2 physical activity (PA) was started in the main hospitals in Luxembourg City (Centrum), Esch/Alzette (South) and Ettelbrück ( North). In 2002 a cornerstone study by Myers et al proved that physical fitness is the most determinant of survival both for healthy people and for cardiac patients: The better the fitness, quantified in METs, the better the prognosis and this fact is the basis for the application of sports therapy in cardiac and most other patients. An important epidemiological study published in 2012 by Lee et al in Lancet analyzed the effects of physical inactivity (PI) all over the world: 4 important diseases were studied: CAD, breast cancer, colon cancer and type 2 diabetes. The effects of PI are most pronounced in colon cancer followed by diabetes 2, breast cancer and then CAD. As a mean about 9% of all deaths -5.9 million in 57 million deaths/year worldwide- are caused by PI and for Luxembourg 12.9%. This cornerstone study can serve as rationale for physical therapy (PT) intervention in oncology, diabetes and CAD. It is noteworthy that the basic RF are more or less the same for the chronic diseases investigated in this study. Since the beginning of the new century PT has become an integral part of the strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. This option has been studied thoroughly first in breast cancer, later also in colon, prostate, and bronchial cancers etc. In primary prevention regular medium intensity training decreases the incidence of cancers by about 20-30%. For patients with proven cancers the application of PA as treatment option is more complicated compared to patients with cardiac problems since cancer patients often have to undergo surgery, then chemo- and/or irradiation therapy. All these interventions and their side effects have to be considered before applying PA. Above the physical alterations most cancer patients have to face anxiety and depression problems. PT improves the outcome between 15-25% and plays an important role in improving the psychological problems of the cancer patients. Since 10 years several oncologists in Luxembourg became interested in PA as a therapeutic option for their patients. They contacted the cardiologists and physiotherapists in charge of cardiac reeducation and progressively programs for PA in oncology were launched also in Luxembourg. Meanwhile several groups of cancer patients offer regular PT programs. In 2014 a stock concerning the different health sport activities in Luxembourg was taken by a young researcher of the Luxembourg Institute of health (LIH). 11 different associations are active; the most important and best organized are the cardiac sports groups, but there are also several oncologic, neurologic and orthopedic sports groups. A target for the coming years is to confer a robust infrastructure to all these associations following the model used by the cardiac groups. For the next year all these groups should be integrated into the Federation of Health Sports of the national Olympic Committee.""","""['C Delagardelle']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Bull Soc Sci Med Grand Duche Luxemb""","""['25 years of organized ambulatory heart sport in Luxembourg.

Methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify 187,730 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 2004 through 2012 who received external beam radiotherapy as their initial form of definitive therapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical factors was used to identify independent determinants of proton therapy use.  Results:   The rate of proton therapy use increased significantly from 2.3% in 2004 to 5.2% in 2011 and 4.8% in 2012 (P value for trend <.0001). Proton therapy for prostate cancer was much more likely to be delivered at an academic compared with nonacademic center and to patients who were white, younger, healthier, from metropolitan areas, from zip codes with higher median household incomes, and who did not have an advanced stage of or high-grade disease (all P<.0001). Compared with white patients, those who were black and Hispanic were found to be significantly less likely to receive proton therapy even after robust multivariable adjustments (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.22; P<.0001] and adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.66; P<.0001], respectively).  Conclusions:   The use of proton therapy to treat patients with prostate cancer more than doubled from 2004 to 2012, with striking racial disparities in its use noted despite robust multivariable adjustments. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine whether the increased use of proton therapy for prostate cancer is justified, and ongoing efforts should be made to ensure equal access to resource-limited oncologic therapies.

Decision aids for patients can support the medical consultation. However, it is not known if German urologists accept decision aids for patients. Comparative data exist from a current survey among american urologists and radio oncologists.  Materials and methods:   From October through November 2014 we conducted an online survey consisting of 11 multiple-choice questions and an optional free text commentary among the members of DGU and BDU. All data was processed anonymously. We received 464 complete responses for a 6.6 % return rate. For group comparison we applied the Chi2-test.  Results:   Respondents' median age was 50 (range 26-87) years and 15 % were female. 7 % were residents, 31 % employed at a clinic, and 57 % in private practice. Due to the low response rate of younger colleagues the results were not representative for the basic population. Regardless of age (p = 0.2) and professional environment (p = 1) shared decision making was preferred by 89 %. When counseling their patients with localized prostate cancer 20 % relied exclusively on conversation. To support their conversation 63 % used print media, 49 % decision aids, 33 % contact offers to support groups, 24 % Internet resources and 13 % video material. From using decision aids 86 % expected positive effects for patients and 78 % for physicians (p = 0.017). 15 % expected a change of the treatment decision. 77 % would motivate their patients to use a decision aid.

However, prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after SBRT has not been well characterized. The objective of the current study is to analyze the rate of PSA decline and PSA nadir following SBRT boost after whole pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   From March 2008 to July 2014, 42 patients newly diagnosed, intermediate- and high-risk (NCCN definition) localized prostate cancer were treated with SBRT boost using Cyberknife after WPRT. The whole pelvis dose was 45 Gy (25 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and the SBRT boost dose was 21 Gy (3 fractions of 7 Gy). No one received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before biochemical relapse. PSA nadir and rate of change in PSA (slope) were calculated and compared.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 53.6 months (range, 14-74), the median rates of decline of PSA were -0.605, -0.229 and -0.166 ng/mL/month, respectively, for durations of 1, 2 and 3 years postradiotherapy, respectively. The median PSA nadir was 0.32 ng/mL after a median 36 months. 4-year biochemical failure (BCF) free survival was 100 percent for intermediate-risk and 71.4 percent for high-risk patients (P = 0.002).  Conclusions:   In this report of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, continuously greater rates of decline PSA for duration 1, 2 and 3 year following SBRT boost after WPRT resulted in lower PSA nadir.

We therefore systematically analyzed the localization of Choline PET/CT positive lymph nodes and compared it to the RTOG recommendation of pelvic CTV, as well as to previous work, the SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas.  Methods:   Thirty-two patients being mostly high risk patients with a PSA of 12.5 ng/ml (median) received PET/CT before any treatment. Eighty-seven patients received PET/CT for staging due to biochemical failure with a median PSA of 3.12 ng/ml. Each single PET-positive lymph node was manually contoured in a ""virtual"" patient dataset to achieve a 3-D visualization, resulting in an atlas of the cumulative PET positive lymph node distribution. Further the PET-positive lymph node location in each patient was assessed with regard to the existence of a potential geographic miss (i.e. PET-positive lymph nodes that would not have been treated adequately by the RTOG consensus on CTV definition of pelvic lymph nodes).  Results:   Seventy-eight and 209 PET positive lymph nodes were detected in patients with no prior treatment and in postoperative patients, respectively. The most common sites of PET positive lymph nodes in patients with no prior treatment were external iliac (32.1 %), followed by common iliac (23.1 %) and para-aortic (19.2 %). In postoperative patients the most common sites of PET positive lymph nodes were common iliac (24.9 %), followed by external iliac (23.0 %) and para-aortic (20.1 %). In patients with no prior treatment there were 34 (43.6 %) and in postoperative patients there were 77 (36.8 %) of all detected lymph nodes that would not have been treated adequately using the RTOG CTV. We compared the distribution of lymph nodes gained by Choline PET/CT to the preexisting SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas and saw an overall good congruence.  Conclusions:   Choline PET/CT and SPECT sentinel lymph node atlas are comparable to each other. More than one-third of the PET positive lymph nodes in patients with no prior treatment and in postoperative patients would not have been treated adequately using the RTOG CTV.

Therefore, actual research is focused on the development of new DOC-based combination treatments. In this study we investigated the antitumor effects of a recombinant immunotoxin targeting the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in combination with DOC in vitro and in vivo. The immunotoxin consists of an anti-PSMA single chain antibody fragment (scFv) as binding and a truncated form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A (PE40) as toxin domain. The immunotoxin induced apoptosis and specifically reduced the viability of androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells. A synergistic cytotoxic activity was observed in combination with DOC with IC50 values in the low picomolar or even femtomolar range. Moreover, combination treatment resulted in an enhanced antitumor activity in a C4-2 SCID mouse xenograft model.

Methods:   An in-house treatment planning system was modified to include multiobjective inverse planning, a probabilistic outcome model, and a multi-attribute decision aid. A genetic algorithm generated a set of plans embodying trade-offs between the separate objectives. An influence diagram network modeled the radiation therapy process of prostate cancer using expert opinion, results of clinical trials, and published research. A Markov model calculated a quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE), which was the endpoint for ranking plans.  Results:   The Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) was designed to produce an approximation of the Pareto Front representing optimal tradeoffs for IMRT plans. Prognostic information from the dosimetrics of the plans, and from patient-specific clinical variables were combined by the influence diagram. QALEs were calculated for each plan for each set of patient characteristics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore changes in outcomes for variations in patient characteristics and dosimetric variables. The model calculated life expectancies that were in agreement with an independent clinical study.  Conclusions:   The radiation therapy model proposed has integrated a number of different physical, biological and clinical models into a more comprehensive model. It illustrates a number of the critical aspects of treatment planning that can be improved and represents a more detailed description of the therapy process. A Markov model was implemented to provide a stronger connection between dosimetric variables and clinical outcomes and could provide a practical, quantitative method for making difficult clinical decisions.""","""['Wade P Smith', 'Minsun Kim', 'Clay Holdsworth', 'Jay Liao', 'Mark H Phillips']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A hierarchical evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization in IMRT.', 'Investigation of effective decision criteria for multiobjective optimization in IMRT.', 'An approach to multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy.

Materials and methods:   The main study cohort included 1383 patients with low intermediate-risk cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy with or without PLND between 1994 and 2013. Positive lymph node (LN) rates were reported and compared to patients with higher (≥20 ng/mL; n = 314) and lower (<10 ng/mL; n = 6861) PSA. Oncological outcome was assessed by Cox regressions in patients with a minimum follow-up of 5years.  Results:   In the main study cohort (PSA 10-20 ng/mL), PLND was performed in 867 (62.7%) patients with a median number of removed LNs of 11 (interquartile range 16-6). Positive LNs were detected in 3.3% of these patients. Compared to the main study cohort, patients with preoperatively higher PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL (or lower PSA < 10 ng/ml) underwent PLND in 83.8% (32.7%) of the cases, with 8.0% (1.8%) showing positive LNs. Median follow-up in the main study cohort was 84.5 months. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in 20.6% of these men. The 5-year and 10-year BCR-free survival rates were 82.2% and 75.6% for those with PLND, and 83.4% and 75.8% for patients without PLND. PLND was not a significant factor influencing BCR-free, metastasis-free, or cancer-specific survival in the main study cohort.  Conclusion:   Positive LNs are rare in patients with Gleason grade ≤ 6, cT ≤ 2b, and PSA 10-20 ng/mL.

Therefore, large prostates are often scanned at reduced spatial resolutions to stay within clinically acceptable measurement times. Here we present a semilocalized adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) sequence with gradient-modulated offset-independent adiabatic (GOIA) refocusing pulses and spiral k-space acquisition (GOIA-sLASER-Spiral) for fast prostate MRSI with enhanced resolution and extended matrix sizes.  Methods:   MR was performed at 3 tesla with an endorectal receive coil. GOIA-sLASER-Spiral at an echo time (TE) of 90 ms was compared to a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) with weighted, elliptical phase encoding at an TE of 145 ms using simulations and measurements of phantoms and patients (n = 9).  Results:   GOIA-sLASER-Spiral acquisition allows prostate MR spectra to be obtained in ∼5 min with a quality comparable to those acquired with a common Cartesian PRESS protocol in ∼9 min, or at an enhanced spatial resolution showing more precise tissue allocation of metabolites. Extended field of views (FOVs) and matrix sizes for large prostates are possible without compromising spatial resolution or measurement time.  Conclusion:   The flexibility of spiral sampling enables prostate MRSI with a wide range of resolutions and FOVs without undesirable increases in acquisition times, as in Cartesian encoding. This approach is suitable for routine clinical exams of prostate metabolites.

We tested this theory in the phase 3 HYPRO trial for patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. We have previously reported acute incidence of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity; here we report data for late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.  Methods:   In this randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial, done in seven radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands, we enrolled intermediate-risk or high-risk patients aged between 44 and 85 years with histologically confirmed stage T1b-T4 NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 60 ng/mL or lower, and WHO performance status of 0-2. A web-based application was used to randomly assign (1:1) patients to receive either standard fractionation with 39 fractions of 2 Gy in 8 weeks (five fractions per week) or hypofractionation with 19 fractions of 3·4 Gy in 6·5 weeks (three fractions per week). Randomisation was done with the minimisation procedure, stratified by treatment centre and risk group. The primary endpoint was to detect a 10% enhancement in 5-year relapse-free survival with hypofractionation. A key additional endpoint was non-inferiority of hypofractionation in cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. We planned to reject inferiority of hypofractionation for late genitourinary toxicity if the estimated hazard ratio (HR) was less than 1·11 and for gastrointestinal toxicity was less than 1·13. We scored toxicity with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria from both physicians' records (clinical record form) and patients' self-assessment questionnaires. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Patient recruitment for the HYPRO trial was completed in 2010. The trial was registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN85138529.  Findings:   Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients (410 in both groups) were randomly assigned. Analyses for late toxicity included 387 assessable patients in the standard fractionation group and 395 in the hypofractionation group. The median follow-up was 60 months (IQR 51·2-67·3). The database for all analyses (both groups and both genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities) was locked on March 26, 2015. The incidence of grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity at 3 years was 39·0% (95% CI 34·2-44·1) in the standard fractionation group and 41·3% (36·6-46·4) in the hypofractionation group. The estimated HR for the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse late genitourinary toxicity was 1·16 (90% CI 0·98-1·38), suggesting that non-inferiority could not be shown. The incidence of grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity at 3 years was 17·7% (14·1-21·9) in standard fractionation and 21·9% (18·1-26·4) hypofractionation. With an estimated HR of 1·19 (90% CI 0·93-1·52) for the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse late gastrointestinal toxicity, we could not confirm non-inferiority of hypofractionation for cumulative late gastrointestinal toxicity. Cumulative grade 3 or worse late genitourinary toxicity was significantly higher in the hypofractionation group than in the standard fractionation group (19·0% [95% CI 15·2-23·2] vs 12·9% [9·7-16·7], respectively; p=0·021), but there was no significant difference between cumulative grade 3 or worse late gastrointestinal toxicity (2·6% [95% CI 1·2-4·7]) in the standard fractionation group and 3·3% [1·7-5·6] in the hypofractionation group; p=0·55).  Interpretation:   Our data could not confirm that hypofractionation was non-inferior for cumulative late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity compared with standard fractionation.

Several independent studies have shown that cells are protected from proteasome inhibition by increased autophagic activity. We investigated whether C/EBPβ, a transcription factor involved in the control of autophagic gene expression, regulates resistance to proteasome inhibition. In PC3 cells over-expressing C/EBPβ, turnover of autophagic substrates and expression of core autophagy genes were increased. Conversely, C/EBPβ knockdown suppressed autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We also found that C/EBPβ knockdown suppressed REDD1 expression to delay early autophagy, an effect rescued by exogenous REDD1. Cells with suppressed C/EBPβ levels showed delayed autophagy activation upon bortezomib treatment. Knockdown of C/EBPβ sensitized PC3 cells to bortezomib, and blockade of autophagy by chloroquine did not further increase cell death in cells expressing shRNA targeting C/EBPβ. Lastly, we observed a decreased growth of PC3 cells and xenografts with C/EBPβ knockdown and such xenografts were sensitized to bortezomib treatment. Our results demonstrate that C/EBPβ is a critical effector of autophagy via regulation of autolysosome formation and promotes resistance to proteasome inhibitor treatment by increasing autophagy.""","""['David J Barakat', 'Janet Mendonca', 'Theresa Barberi', 'Jing Zhang', 'Sushant K Kachhap', 'Ido Paz-Priel', 'Alan D Friedman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Bortezomib enhances cancer cell death by blocking the autophagic flux through stimulating ERK phosphorylation.', 'Molecular analysis of cell survival and death pathways in the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib-resistant PC3 prostate cancer cell line.', 'Bortezomib induction of C/EBPβ mediates Epstein-Barr virus lytic activation in Burkitt lymphoma.', 'EGCG antagonizes Bortezomib cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells by an autophagic mechanism.', 'Cytochalasin E increased the sensitivity of human lung cancer A549\u202fcells to bortezomib via inhibition of autophagy.', 'Targeting Transcription Factors ATF5, CEBPB and CEBPD with Cell-Penetrating Peptides to Treat Brain and Other Cancers.', 'Stress-induced epinephrine promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of CRC through the CEBPB/TRIM2/P53 axis.', 'DDIT4 mediates the proliferation-promotive effect of IL-34 in human monocytic leukemia cells.', 'Pre-activation of autophagy impacts response to olaparib in prostate cancer cells.', 'Drug-induced cell viability prediction from LINCS-L1000 through WRFEN-XGBoost algorithm.']"""

Characteristic features of CRPC can be increased androgen receptor (AR) expression and altered transcriptional output. We investigated the expression of nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) in human prostate and prostate cancer and the role of NCOR1 in response to antiandrogens.  Experimental design:   NCOR1 protein levels were compared between matched normal prostate and prostate cancer in 409 patient samples. NCOR1 knockdown was used to investigate its effect on bicalutamide response in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines and transcriptional changes associated with the loss of NCOR1. NCOR1 transcriptional signature was also examined in prostate cancer gene expression datasets.  Results:   NCOR1 protein was detected in cytoplasm and nuclei of secretory epithelial cells in normal prostate. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear NCOR1 protein levels were lower in prostate cancer than in normal prostate. Prostate cancer metastases show significant decrease in NCOR1 transcriptional output. Inhibition of LNCaP cellular proliferation by bicalutamide requires NCOR1. NCOR1-regulated genes suppress cellular proliferation and mediate bicalutamide resistance. In the mouse, NCOR1 is required for bicalutamide-dependent regulation of a subset of the AR target genes.  Conclusions:   In summary, we demonstrated that NCOR1 function declines with prostate cancer progression.

However, most epidemiologic studies assess alcoholic beverage consumption using self-reported data, leading to potential exposure misclassification. Biomarkers of alcohol consumption may provide an alternative, complementary approach that reduces misclassification and incorporates individual differences in alcohol metabolism. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between previously identified alcohol consumption-related metabolites and colorectal cancer and adenoma using serum metabolomics data from two studies. Data on colorectal cancer were obtained from a nested case-control study of 502 US adults (252 cases, 250 controls) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Data on colorectal adenoma were obtained from a case-control study of 197 US adults (120 cases, 77 controls) from the Navy Colon Adenoma Study. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were fit to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for eight alcohol consumption-related metabolites identified in a previous analysis: ethyl glucuronide; 4-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate 1; 5-alpha-androstan-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate; 16-hydroxypalmitate; bilirubin (E,Z or Z,E); cyclo (-leu-pro); dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6); and palmitoleate (16:1n7). We found no clear association between these alcohol consumption-related metabolites and either endpoint. However, we did observe an inverse association between cyclo (-leu-pro) and colorectal adenoma that was only observed in the highest metabolite quantile (OR 4th vs. 1st Quantile = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12-0.78; P-trend = 0.047), but no association for colorectal cancer.

This discrepancy is hypothesized to be due to the use survival calculations based on time from diagnosis (TFD), which can bias toward better survival for younger cohorts. Attained age is an alternative timescale that can mitigate this effect. A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results comparison of prostatectomy, radiotherapy (XRT), and conservative management for localized prostatic cancer was conducted to compare these 2 timescales.  Methods:   Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to contrast overall survival based on TFD and attained age from 279,064 prostate cancer cases. Proportional hazards models were constructed and baseline hazard functions estimated.  Results:   The prostatectomy cohort averaged 9 to 12 years younger than the radiotherapy or conservative management cohorts, and the baseline hazard depended more strongly upon age than TFD. Survival calculations based on TFD demonstrated a major benefit with prostatectomy compared with XRT and conservative management, consistent with prior observational studies. Calculations based on attained age, however, demonstrated lesser differences between treatment cohorts and were more consistent with published randomized trials.  Conclusions:   The survival benefit apparent to prostatectomy in conventional observational cohort studies could reflect an age-related bias attributable to their use of TFD analysis. Care is warranted in the choice of timescale in observational analysis if large age differences exist between treatment cohorts.

It makes use of the fluorescence-quenching properties of 1-methyladenine; removal of the alkyl group results in a >10-fold light-up signal. The probe is specific for ALKBH3 over its related homologue ALKBH2 and can be used to identify and measure the effectiveness of enzyme inhibitors. Measurements of the enzyme substrate parameters show that MAQ displays Km and kcat values essentially the same as those of the native substrate.

Given the fundamental impact of sphingolipid machinery to each individual process, the sphingolipid-related mechanisms might be considered among the most prominent drivers/players of EMT; yet, there is still limited knowledge. Given the complexity of the interconnected sphingolipid system, which includes distinct sphingolipid mediators, their synthesizing enzymes, receptors and transporters, we herein apply an integrative approach for assessment of the sphingolipid-associated mechanisms underlying EMT program. We created the sphingolipid-/EMT-relevant 41-gene/23-gene signatures which were applied to denote transcriptional events in a lung cancer cell-based EMT model. Based on defined 35-gene sphingolipid/EMT-attributed signature of regulated genes, we show close associations between EMT markers, genes comprising the sphingolipid network at multiple levels and encoding sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-/ceramide-metabolizing enzymes, S1P and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors and S1P transporters, pluripotency genes and inflammation-related molecules, and demonstrate the underlying biological pathways and regulators. Mass spectrometry-based sphingolipid analysis revealed an EMT-attributed shift towards increased S1P and LPA accompanied by reduced ceramide levels. Notably, using transcriptomics data across various cell-based perturbations and neoplastic tissues (24193 arrays), we identified the sphingolipid/EMT signature primarily in lung adenocarcinoma tissues; besides, bladder, colorectal and prostate cancers were among the top-ranked. The findings also highlight novel regulatory associations between influenza virus and the sphingolipid/EMT-associated mechanisms.

We investigated the antitumor effect of As2O3 in human PCa cell lines LNCaP and PC3 and the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the Wnt signaling pathway.  Methods:   The effect of As2O3 on the viability and apoptosis of PCa cells was investigated by cholecystokinin-8 and flow cytometry. The expression of the related proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway and the downstream target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway was examined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR assay. The methylation status of the SFRP1 gene promoter was assessed by bisulfite sequencing.  Results:   As2O3 inhibited the viability of PCa cells and induced apoptosis of PCa cells in a dose-dependent manner. The protein level of phosphoglycogen synthase kinase-3β was upregulated, whereas the protein level of β-catenin and the mRNA levels of c-MYC, MMP-7, and COX-2 were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in PCa cells treated with As2O3. In addition, As2O3 upregulated the protein and mRNA levels of secreted frizzled related protein-1, and increased the demethylation of the SFRP1 gene promoter.

It is not clear, however, whether PDEF is involved in the development or progression of bladder cancer. In a comparison between normal urothelium and bladder tumor tissue, we identified significant decreases of PDEF in the tumor tissue. Further, the immunohistochemistry assays indicated a significantly higher immunostaining of PDEF in low-grade bladder tumors. Additionally, the highly differentiated transitional-cell bladder carcinoma RT-4 cells expressed significantly more PDEF levels than the bladder carcinoma HT1376 and the T24 cells. Ectopic overexpression of PDEF attenuated proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of bladder carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. PDEF enhanced the expression levels of mammary serine protease inhibitor (MASPIN), N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), KAI1, and B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2). PDEF modulated epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) by upregulating E-cadherin expression and downregulating the expression of N-cadherin, SNAIL, SLUG, and vimentin, leading to lower migration and invasion abilities of bladder carcinoma cells. Filamentous actin (F-actin) polarization and remodeling were observed in PDEF-knockdown RT-4 cells. Our results suggest that PDEF gene expression is associated with the extent of bladder neoplasia and PDEF modulated the expressions of EMT-related genes.

Discovery of new scaffolds distinct from the 4-cyano/nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group common to currently used antiandrogens is urgently needed to avoid cross-resistance with these compounds. In this study, a series of twenty-nine 7-substituted umbelliferone derivatives was prepared and their antiproliferative activities were evaluated. The most active compound 7a demonstrated submicromolar inhibitory activity in the human prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1); IC50=0.93 μM which represents a 50 fold improvement over the clinical antiandrogen bicalutamide (IC50=46 μM) and a more than 30 fold improvement over enzalutamide (IC50=32 μM).

Methods:   The study population comprised 2394 PCa patients undergoing RP at our institution in Korea.

Results:   Among 2034 patients, PNI and LVI were detected in 69.3 and 12.4 % patients, respectively. Patients with PNI or LVI had higher rates of advanced biopsy and pathological Gleason score (≥7), and higher proportions of advanced clinical and pathological T stage ≥3, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and surgical margin positivity. Notably, BCR-free survival was lower in patients with PNI or LVI compared with that in patients without these markers and lower in patients with both markers compared with that in other populations of patients. Moreover, PNI (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11) and LVI (HR = 1.57) were significant predictors of BCR. The presence of the two markers was associated with a higher risk of BCR (HR = 4.60) compared with the presence of either marker alone (HR = 3.47).

Here we have determined its distribution in prostate cancer tissue and its role in prostate tumorigenesis using in vitro and in vivo assays. Data-mining studies strongly suggest that 12-HETER1 expression positively correlates with the aggressiveness and progression of prostate tumors. This was corroborated with real-time PCR analysis of human prostate tumor tissue arrays that revealed the expression of 12-HETER1 positively correlates with the clinical stages of prostate cancers and Gleason scores. Immunohistochemistry analysis also proved that the expression of 12-HETER1 is positively correlated with the grades of prostate cancer. Knockdown of 12-HETER1 in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced colony formation and inhibited tumor growth in animals. To discover the regulatory factors, 5 candidate 12-HETER1 promoter cis elements were assayed as luciferase reporter fusions in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, where the putative cis element required for gene regulation was mapped 2 kb upstream of the 12-HETER1 transcriptional start site.

AA plus prednisone (P) (AA+P) is approved for the treatment of patients with mCRPC.  Objective:   To investigate whether long-term use of low-dose P with or without AA leads to corticosteroid-associated adverse events (CA-AEs) in mCRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 2267 patients in COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302. We used an inclusive Standardized MedDRA Queries-oriented approach to identify 112 preferred terms for known CA-AEs, and assessed the incidence of CA-AEs during 3-mo exposure intervals and across all P exposure levels.  Intervention:   All 2267 patients received 5mg of P twice daily, and 1333/2267 received AA (1g) plus P.  Results and limitations:   The CA-AE incidence after any P exposure was 25%, 26%, and 23% for any grade, and 5%, 5%, and 4% for grade ≥3 CA-AEs for all patients and the AA+P and P alone groups, respectively. The most common any-grade CA-AEs were hyperglycemia (7.4%, 7.8%, and 6.9% for all patients, AA+P, and P alone, respectively) and weight increase (4.3%, 3.9%, and 4.8%, respectively). When assessed by duration of exposure (3-mo intervals up to ≥30 mo), no discernable trend was observed for CA-AEs, including hyperglycemia and weight increase. The investigator-reported study discontinuation rate due to CA-AEs was 11/2267 (0.5%), and one patient had a CA-AE resulting in death.  Conclusions:   Low-dose P given with or without AA is associated with low overall incidence of CA-AEs. The frequency of CA-AEs remained low with increased duration of exposure to P.

A decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used to monitor treatment response, but is not validated as an intermediate endpoint for overall survival (OS).  Objective:   To evaluate the association between early PSA decline and OS following abiraterone acetate (AA) treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified mCRPC patients treated with AA before or after docetaxel at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust between 2006 and 2014. Early PSA decline was defined as a 30% decrease in PSA at 4 wk relative to baseline, and early PSA rise as a 25% increase.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Association with OS was analyzed using multivariate Cox regression and log-rank analyses. Spearman's rho correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to evaluate the association between PSA changes at 4 wk and 12 wk.  Results and limitations:   There were 274 patients eligible for this analysis. A 30% PSA decline at 4 wk was associated with longer OS (25.8 vs 15.1 mo; hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, p<0.001), and a 25% PSA rise at 4 wk with shorter OS (15.1 vs 23.8 mo; HR 1.7, p=0.001) in both univariate and multivariable models. The percentage PSA decline at 4 wk was significantly correlated with the percentage PSA change at 12 wk (r=0.82; p<0.001). Patients achieving a 30% PSA decline at 4 wk were 11.7 times more likely to achieve a 50% PSA decrease at 12 wk (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 79.4%). Limitations include the retrospective design of this analysis.  Conclusions:   Patients not achieving 30% PSA decline after 4 wk of AA have a lower likelihood of achieving PSA response at 12 wk and significantly inferior OS. Prospective multicentre validation studies are needed to confirm these findings.  Patient summary:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is commonly used to evaluate response to treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Expert recommendations discourage reliance on PSA changes earlier than 12 wk after treatment initiation.

Materials and methods:   Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who experienced treatment failure with chemotherapy and novel androgen receptor targeted therapy were treated for 8 weeks with up to 4 cycles of (177)Lu-PSMA-I&T. We report safety data, the antitumor response with prostate specific antigen decreases and the radiographic tumor response as well as the clinical outcome with changes in ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status and pain severity.  Results:   The first 3 patients were treated with a lower activity of 3.7 GBq in cycle 1. Due to a favorable safety profile the activity was increased to 7.4 GBq in 19 subsequent patients who completed a total of 40 cycles. With the higher activity no grade 3/4 toxicities were observed. The main nonhematological and hematological grade 1/2 toxicities were dry mouth in 7 patients (37%), anemia in 6 (32%) and thrombopenia in 5 (25%). The proportion of patients who achieved a maximum prostate specific antigen decrease of 30% or greater, 50% or greater and 90% or greater was 56%, 33% and 11%, respectively. Combined assessment of bone and soft tissue metastases showed complete remission in 5% of patients, stable disease in 63% and progressive disease in 32%. ECOG performance status improved or was stable in 74% of patients. Of men with bone pain 58% achieved complete resolution or reduced pain.

Objectives:   To compare health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in patients receiving combined RT with and without ADT METHODS: The study population comprised patients treated with definitive RT for prostate cancer who completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 form between 3 and 24 months after completing RT. Covariance and a stepwise backward logistic regression model was used.  Results:   Data were available for 143 patients who received RT+ADT and 70 who received RT alone. The sexual function and hormonal vitality scores of patients receiving RT+ADT were significantly lower than those receiving RT alone (P < 0.0001). Patients with only compulsory school education had significantly lower sexual function scores than patients with university level education (P ≤ 0.005). Patients with depression had significantly lower hormonal vitality scores than those without depression (P ≤ 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The addition of ADT to RT is responsible for decrements in quality of life in the sexual and hormonal vitality domains, which is further compounded by depression and lack of education. This underlines the need to improve education, identify and treat depression, and develop strategies to improve the quality of life of patients receiving combination therapy.""","""['Tamara Kushnir', 'Ofer N Gofrit', 'Ruth Elkayam', 'Shani Paluch-Shimon', 'Yaacov R Lawrence', 'Lana Weiss', 'Zvi Symon']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Isr Med Assoc J""","""['Sexual bother in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Upfront androgen deprivation therapy with salvage radiation may improve biochemical outcomes in prostate cancer patients with post-prostatectomy rising PSA.', 'Long-term quality of life in disadvantaged men with prostate cancer on androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Psychological effects of androgen-deprivation therapy on men with prostate cancer and their partners.', 'Contemporary use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: managing complications and addressing quality-of-life issues.', 'Sexual function outcomes of radiation and androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer in men with good baseline function.', 'Clinical significance of androgen secretion disorders in men with a malignancy.', 'The Impact of Obesity on Patient Reported Outcomes Following Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

For prostate cancer (PrCa), rare mutations in BRCA2 and BRCA1 give rise to moderately elevated risk, whereas two of B100 common, low-penetrance PrCa susceptibility variants identified so far by genome-wide association studies implicate RAD51B and RAD23B.  Methods:   Genotype data from the iCOGS array were imputed to the 1000 genomes phase 3 reference panel for 21 780 PrCa cases and 21 727 controls from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium. We subsequently performed single variant, gene and pathway-level analyses using 81 303 SNPs within 20 Kb of a panel of 179 DNA-repair genes.  Results:   Single SNP analyses identified only the previously reported association with RAD51B. Gene-level analyses using the SKAT-C test from the SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT) identified a significant association with PrCa for MSH5. Pathway-level analyses suggested a possible role for the translesion synthesis pathway in PrCa risk and Homologous recombination/Fanconi Anaemia pathway for PrCa aggressiveness, even though after adjustment for multiple testing these did not remain significant.  Conclusions:   MSH5 is a novel candidate gene warranting additional follow-up as a prospective PrCa-risk locus.

Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for PCa detection, and to explore the clinical utility of ultrahigh b-value DW-MRI in predicting prostate biopsy outcomes.  Methodology:   73 male patients were selected for the study. They underwent 3T MRI using T2WI conventional DW-MRI with b-value 1000 s/mm2, and ultrahigh b-value DW-MRI with b-values of 2000 s/mm2 and 3000 s/mm2. Two radiologists evaluated individual prostate gland images on a 5-point rating scale using PI-RADS, for the purpose of region-specific comparisons among modalities. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and likelihood ratios (LR) were investigated for each MRI modality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was also calculated.  Results:   Results showed the improved diagnostic value of ultrahigh b-value DWI-MRI for detection of PCa when compared to other b values and conventional MRI protocols. Sensitivity values for 3000 s/mm2 in both peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) were significantly higher than those observed with conventional DW-MRI-Specificity values for 3000 s/mm2 in the TZ were significantly higher than other b-value images, whereas specificity values using 3000 s/mm2 in the PZ were not significantly higher than 2000 s/mm2 images. PPV and NPV between 3000 s/mm2 and the other three modalities were significantly higher for both PZ and TZ images. The PLRs and NLRs of b-value 3000 s/mm2 DW-MRI in the PZ and TZ were also recorded. ROC analysis showed greater AUCs for the b value 3000 s/mm2 DWI than for the other three modalities.  Conclusions:   DW-MRI with a b-value of 3000 s/mm2 was found to be the most accurate and reliable MRI modality for PCa tumor detection and localization, particularly for TZ lesion discrimination. It may be stated that the b-value of 3000 s/mm2 is a novel, improved diagnostic biomarker with greater predictive accuracy for PCa prior to biopsy.""","""['Kun Zhang', 'Yanguang Shen', 'Xu Zhang', 'Lu Ma', 'Haiyi Wang', 'Ningyu An', 'Aitao Guo', 'Huiyi Ye']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of prostate transition-zone cancer.', 'Evaluation of different mathematical models and different b-value ranges of diffusion-weighted imaging in peripheral zone prostate cancer detection using b-value up to 4500 s/mm2.', 'Diagnostic efficacy of b value (2000\u2009s/mm2) diffusion-weighted imaging for prostate cancer: Comparison of a reduced field of view sequence and a conventional technique.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The value of diffusion-weighted imaging in the detection of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Clinical impact of ultra-high b-value (3000 s/mm2) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer at 3T: comparison with b-value of 2000 s/mm2.', 'Quantifying the Effect of Location Matching on Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Prior to Prostate Biopsy-A Multicentre Study.', 'Signal Intensity of High B-value Diffusion-weighted Imaging for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging features of the prostatic leiomyoma-case report.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate: should we use quantitative metrics to better characterize focal lesions originating in the peripheral zone?']"""

The vesicourethral anastomotic technique is handled differently between open and robotic RP. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the frequency of anastomotic leakages and strictures differed between patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to identify risk factors associated with these complications. Materials and methods The study included 735 consecutive patients who underwent RRP (n = 499) or RARP (236) at the Department of Urology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, in a complete 3 year period from 2010 to 2012. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyse associations between surgical procedure (RRP vs RARP) and anastomotic complications. Analyses included age, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, surgeon, prostate volume and anastomotic leakage as variables. Owing to a low number of events, multivariable analyses only included smoking status, diabetes and prostate volume for anastomotic leakage, and age, smoking status, prostate volume and anastomotic leakage for anastomotic strictures. Results The frequency of anastomotic leakage was 2.9%. Anastomotic stricture was seen in 4.9% of patients during follow-up. No differences were found in the frequency of anastomotic leakage (p = 0.35) or strictures (p = 0.35) between RRP and RARP. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between surgeon and the risk of anastomotic strictures in RRP patients (p = 0.02). No other independent risk factors were identified. Conclusion Overall, the anastomotic complication rate in this cohort is similar to other published reports. No obvious risk factors for anastomotic complications could be identified, which in part was due to the low number of events.""","""['André Jacobsen', 'Kasper Drimer Berg', 'Peter Iversen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Martin Andreas Røder']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Clinical significance and risk factors of urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional study.', 'Optimizing vesicourethral anastomosis healing after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: lessons learned from three techniques in 1900 patients.', 'Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', 'All you need to know about urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Examination of Necessity for Pelvic Drain Placement After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical significance and risk factors of urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional study.', 'Early Continence and Extravasation After Open Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy - Interrupted vs Continuous Suturing for Vesicourethral Anastomosis.', 'Continuous poliglecaprone suture versus bidirectional barded suture for urethrovesical anastomosis during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-institute retrospective analysis of Chinese patients.', 'Posterior urethral stenosis after prostate cancer treatment: contemporary options for definitive management.']"""

Diet is a major source of pro- and anti-inflammatory compounds. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was designed to estimate its overall inflammatory potential.  Objective:   Our objective was to investigate the associations between the DII and overall, breast, and prostate cancer risks.  Methods:   This prospective study included 6542 participants [3771 women and 2771 men with a mean ± SD age of 49.2 ± 6.4 y and a BMI (in kg/m2) of 24.0 ± 3.6 at baseline] from the Supplémentation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort who completed at least six 24-h dietary records during the first 2 y of follow-up. The DII was based on 36 food variables. Higher scores corresponded to more proinflammatory diets. A total of 559 incident cancers were diagnosed (median follow-up, 12.6 y), including 158 female breast and 123 prostate cancers (the 2 main cancer sites in this cohort). Associations were characterized by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Stratified analyses were performed according to the median of usual daily alcohol intake.  Results:   Sex-specific quartiles of the DII were positively associated with prostate cancer risk [quartile (Q) 4 compared with Q1, HR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.09] but not with overall or breast cancer risks. There was an interaction between the DII and alcohol intake (grams per day) on overall cancer risk (P-interaction = 0.02): the DII was positively associated with overall cancer risk in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.68; P-trend = 0.02), whereas no association was detected in higher consumers of alcohol (P-trend = 0.8). This interaction was also observed for breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.001).  Conclusion:   Consistent with mechanistic data, findings from this study indicated that proinflammatory diets are associated with increased prostate cancer risk and, in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers, with increased overall and breast cancer risk.

In this study, we present the validation of an efficient dose calculation algorithm for intensity modulated proton therapy, the fast dose calculator (FDC), based on a track-repeating technique. We validated the FDC algorithm for 23 patients, which included 7 brain, 6 head-and-neck, 5 lung, 1 spine, 1 pelvis and 3 prostate cases. For validation, we compared FDC-generated dose distributions with those from a full-fledged Monte Carlo based on GEANT4 (G4). We compared dose-volume-histograms, 3D-gamma-indices and analyzed a series of dosimetric indices. More than 99% of the voxels in the voxelized phantoms describing the patients have a gamma-index smaller than unity for the 2%/2 mm criteria.

There are limited data on dosimetric parameters that may predict for poor continence recovery in men who receive postoperative IMRT.  Methods and materials:   Eighty-seven men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who underwent prostatectomy followed by adjuvant (13%) or salvage (87%) IMRT were identified. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index composite questionnaire was prospectively collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months post-IMRT. Relevant critical structures were contoured and dose-volume metrics collected. The primary endpoint was urinary continence global score. Longitudinal analysis using a generalized estimating equation model was performed.  Results:   There was no statistically significant change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index composite urinary continence global scores over time as compared with baseline (all P > .05). In univariate analysis, bladder volume receiving 70 Gy (V70 Gy) and penile bulb V70 Gy were associated with urinary continence (odds ratio, 0.82; P < .05). In a multivariable model that included body mass index, distance between vesicourethral junction and genitourinary diaphragm, time from surgery, use of antihypertensive medications, age, diabetes, and bladder V70 Gy, only bladder V70 Gy (odds ratio, 0.82; P = .03) was associated with outcome. After 2 years, there was a significant difference in global score for those with V70 Gy < 42.27 versus ≥42.27 mL (all P < .05 at 2 and 3 years post-IMRT).  Conclusion:   There was no significant change in patient-reported urinary continence scores after postprostatectomy IMRT. Bladder V70 Gy was independently associated with a decrease in urinary continence scores. Further evaluation is necessary to optimize quality of life in these men.""","""['Christina H Son', 'James M Melotek', 'Chuanhong Liao', 'Greg Hubert', 'Charles A Pelizzari', 'Scott E Eggener', 'Stanley L Liauw']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Pathophysiology and Contributing Factors in Postprostatectomy Incontinence: A Review.', 'Urinary incontinence as a factor in prostate cancer treatment selection.', 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy in combination with endocrinotherapy in the treatment of middle and advanced Prostatic Cancer.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Late toxicity after post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiation therapy: Evaluating normal-tissue sparing guidelines.']"""

However, achieving molecular imaging using non-invasive MRI with high resolution has yet to be achieved due to the lack of contrast agents with significantly improved relaxivity for sensitivity, targeting capabilities and metal selectivity. We have previously reported our creation of a novel class of protein Gd(3+) contrast agents, ProCA32, which displayed significantly improved relaxivity while exhibiting strong Gd(3+) binding selectivity over physiological metal ions. In this study, we report our effort in further developing biomarker-targeted protein MRI contrast agents for molecular imaging of PSMA. Among three PSMA targeted contrast agents engineered with addition of different molecular recognition sequences, ProCA32.PSMA exhibits a binding affinity of 1.1 ± 0.1 μM for PSMA while the metal binding affinity is maintained at 0.9 ± 0.1 × 10(-22) M. In addition, ProCA32.PSMA exhibits r1 of 27.6 mM(-1) s(-1) and r2 of 37.9 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (55.2 and 75.8 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule r1 and r2, respectively) at 1.4 T. At 7 T, ProCA32.PSMA also has r2 of 94.0 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (188.0 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule) and r1 of 18.6 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (37.2 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule). This contrast capability enables the first MRI enhancement dependent on PSMA expression levels in tumor bearing mice using both T1 and T2-weighted MRI at 7 T. Further development of these PSMA-targeted contrast agents are expected to be used for the precision imaging of prostate cancer at an early stage and to monitor disease progression and staging, as well as determine the effect of therapeutic treatment by non-invasive evaluation of the PSMA level using MRI.""","""['Fan Pu', 'Mani Salarian', 'Shenghui Xue', 'Jingjuan Qiao', 'Jie Feng', 'Shanshan Tan', 'Anvi Patel', 'Xin Li', 'Kenza Mamouni', 'Khan Hekmatyar', 'Juan Zou', 'Daqing Wu', 'Jenny J Yang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Feasibility of Gd-Based prostate cancer targeted magnetic resonance agents using prostate specific membrane antigen.', 'PSMA-targeted contrast agents for intraoperative imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of Gd(III) -Based Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agents for Molecular Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Advances in prostate-specific membrane antigen PET of prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Visualization and Quantification of the Extracellular Matrix in Prostate Cancer Using an Elastin Specific Molecular Probe.', 'RGD-Peptide Functionalization Affects the In Vivo Diffusion of a Responsive Trimeric MRI Contrast Agent through Interactions with Integrins.', 'Molecular MR Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Design of Calcium-Binding Proteins to Sense Calcium.']"""

Materials and methods:   In total, 211 prostate cancer patients, 78 low risk, 53 intermediate risk and 80 high risk were treated between 2005 and 2011. Intermediate- and high-risk patients received 51.8 Gy to pelvic lymph nodes and concomitant simultaneous integrated boost to prostate up to 74.2 Gy/28 fractions, whereas low-risk patients were treated to the prostate only with 71.4 Gy/28 fractions. Daily megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) image guidance was applied. Androgen deprivation was prescribed for a median duration of 6 months for low-risk patients (for downsizing), 12 months for intermediate-risk and 36 months for high-risk patients. The 5 year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival and late gastrointestinal and genitourinary CTCAE.v3 toxicity were assessed. The effect of several clinical variables on both outcome and gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicity was tested by uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 5 years, the late toxicity actuarial incidence was: genitourinary ≥ grade 2: 20.2%; genitourinary ≥ grade 3: 5.9%; gastrointestinal ≥ grade 2: 17%; gastrointestinal ≥ grade 3: 6.3% with lower prevalence at the last follow-up visit (≥ grade 3: genitourinary: 1.9%; gastrointestinal: 1.9%). Major predictors of ≥ grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity were genitourinary acute toxicity ≥ grade 2 (hazard ratio: 4.9) and previous surgery (hazard ratio: 3.4). The overall 5 year bRFS was 93.7% (low risk: 94.6%; intermediate risk: 96.2%; high risk: 91.1%), overall survival and CSS were 88.6% (low risk: 90.5%; intermediate risk: 87.4%; high risk: 87%) and 97.5% (low risk: 98.7%; intermediate risk: 95%; high risk: 94.3%), respectively. Risk classes and androgen deprivation were not significantly correlated with either bRFS, overall survival or CSS. Twelve patients experienced a biochemical relapse but none experienced clinically proven local and/or pelvic recurrence.  Conclusion:   A satisfactory 5 year outcome with an acceptable toxicity profile was observed.

In this study, urogenital dysfunction after surgical rectal cancer treatment was measured and possible predisposing factors that may have an impact on the development of this disorder were discussed.  Methods:   One hundred eight patients undergoing curative rectal cancer surgery from January 2008 to December 2014 were questioned using questionnaires: male urinary function was assessed using the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire, for sexual function-International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). The Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (BFLUTS) questionnaire and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were used for female urogenital function assessment prior to the operation and 6 months postoperatively.  Results:   A total of 67.0 % of male (36) and 33.0 % (18) of female patients who completed the questionnaire were included in the study. Preoperatively, male urinary dysfunction was 80.1 % and postoperatively-88.9 %. In female patients, preoperative urinary dysfunction was seen in 75.0 % patients, postoperatively-78.0 %. Erectile dysfunction was seen in 41.7 % males preoperatively and in 63.9 % postoperatively. A total of 83.3 % of female patients had sexual dysfunction preoperatively and 94 % postoperatively.  Conclusion:   Sexual and urinary problems after surgery for rectal cancer are common. Preoperative genitourinary dysfunction is not uncommon in patients older than 60 years as well. Female patients reported higher rates of sexual dysfunction than males. These results point out the importance of sexual and urinary (dys)function in survivors of rectal cancer.

We detected an increase in SNX9 expression in human breast cancer metastases compared with primary tumors and demonstrated that SNX9 expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is necessary to maintain their ability to metastasize in a chick embryo model. Reciprocally, SNX9 knockdown impairs the process. In vitro studies using several cancer cell lines derived from a variety of human tumors revealed a role for SNX9 in cell invasion and identified mechanisms responsible for this novel function. We showed that SNX9 controls the activation of RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases and also regulates cell motility via the modulation of well-known molecules involved in metastasis, namely RhoA-ROCK and N-WASP. In addition, we have discovered that SNX9 is required for RhoGTPase-dependent, clathrin-independent endocytosis, and in this capacity, can functionally substitute to the bona fide Rho GAP, GRAF1 (GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal Adhesion Kinase). Together, our data establish novel roles for SNX9 as a multifunctional protein scaffold that regulates, and potentially coordinates, several cellular processes that together can enhance cancer cell metastasis.""","""['Nawal Bendris', 'Karla C Williams', 'Carlos R Reis', 'Erik S Welf', 'Ping-Hung Chen', 'Bénédicte Lemmers', 'Michael Hahne', 'H S Leong', 'Sandra L Schmid']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Biol Cell""","""['Endocytosis, Metastasis and Beyond: Multiple Facets of SNX9.', 'Sorting nexin 9 negatively regulates invadopodia formation and function in cancer cells.', 'Interaction of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein with sorting nexin 9 is required for CD28 endocytosis and cosignaling in T cells.', 'SNX9 - a prelude to vesicle release.', 'SNX9 couples actin assembly to phosphoinositide signals and is required for membrane remodeling during endocytosis.', 'The KMT2A recombinome of acute leukemias in 2023.', 'Longitudinal bioluminescence imaging to monitor breast tumor growth and treatment response using the chick chorioallantoic membrane model.', 'SNX20 Expression Correlates with Immune Cell Infiltration and Can Predict Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Obscurin: A multitasking giant in the fight against cancer.', 'Increased SNX20 and PD-L1 Levels Can Predict the Clinical Response to PD-1 Inhibitors in Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

To further comprehend the mechanisms by which PCA3 modulates LNCaP cell survival, we characterized the expression patterns of several cancer-related genes, including those involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and AR cofactors in response to PCA3 silencing. We also aimed to develop a strategy to stably silence PCA3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down PCA3 in LNCaP cells. The expression of 84 cancer-related genes, as well as those coding for AR cofactors and EMT markers, was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). LNCaP-PCA3 silenced cells differentially expressed 16 of the 84 cancer genes tested, mainly those involved in gene expression control and cell signaling. PCA3 knockdown also induced the upregulation of several transcripts coding for AR cofactors and modulated the expression of EMT markers. LNCaP cells transduced with lentivirus vectors carrying an shRNA sequence targeting PCA3 stably downregulated PCA3 expression, causing a significant drop (60 %) in the proportion of LNCaP cells expressing the transgene. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that PCA3 silencing modulates the expression of key cancer-related genes, including those coding for AR cofactors and EMT markers.

Methods:   This prospective study enrolled 100 consecutive patients radically treated for prostate cancer and presenting with rising PSA. Of these 100 patients, 89 were included in the analysis. All had biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy (at least 3 months previously), had (11)C-choline and (18)F-FACBC PET/CT performed within 1 week and were off hormonal therapy at the time of the scans. The two tracers were compared directly in terms of overall positivity/negativity on both a per-patient basis and a per-site basis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were calculated for both the tracers; follow-up at 1 year (including correlative imaging, PSA trend and pathology when available) was considered as the standard of reference.  Results:   In 51 patients the results were negative and in 25 patients positive with both the tracers, in eight patients the results were positive with (18)F-FACBC but negative with (11)C-choline, and in five patients the results were positive with (11)C-choline but negative with (18)F-FACBC. Overall in 49 patients the results were false-negative (FN), in two true-negative, in 24 true-positive (TP) and in none false-positive (FP) with both tracers.

This study investigates the impact of opening a new RT clinic on distance and road travel time to RT, and overall utilisation for prostate and breast cancer patients over a 3-year period in North Queensland (NQ), Australia.  Methods:   The study used retrospective audit of two radiotherapy databases and a geographic information system to illustrate patient origins and distance to the RT clinic used over 3 years. Prostate and female breast cancer patients were selected from the radiation oncology databases of The Townsville Hospital (TTH) and Radiation Oncology Queensland (ROQ) Cairns between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2013. Distance from a patient's home origin to the RT facility was mapped using a geographic information system (ArcGIS software), and travel time (minutes) and road distance (km) determined by Google Maps road directions.  Results:   Overall number of prostate and breast cancer patients treated by RT in Cairns and Townsville clinics increased by 16% in 2011-2012 and by 29% in 2012-2013 from year 1 values. In 2010, 44% of the patients travelled 200-400 km to RT, which reduced to 21% in 2013. By 2013, with a second treatment facility, more than 70% of patients lived within 200 km of an RT facility (p<0.0001). Total median road travel time reduced annually from 201 minutes in 2010-2011 to 66 minutes in 2011-2012 and 56 minutes in 2012-2013 (p<0.0001), corresponding to a decrease in the median distance travelled to an RT facility.

Material and methods:   The data of the national health statistics (Form 131/o, 7, 35) were used to make an expert analytical assessment of the results of prophylactic medical examinations for cancer in certain adult population groups in Russia in 2013-2014.  Results:   Medical examinations covered 20.5 and 22.5 million people in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The proportion of 21-36-, 39-60-, and over 60-year olds was 36, 42, and 22%, respectively. All the age groups showed a preponderance of women with their larger proportion in the older age groups (55, 58, and 64%, respectively). In 2013 and 2014 there were 27,173 and 34,638 detected patients with malignances, including 17,095 (62.9%) and 20,944 (60.5%) women and 10,078 (37.1%) and 13,694 (39.5%) men, respectively. In these years, the breast (28 and 30.5%), prostate (13.9 and 18.5%), rectum (6.5 and 7.5%), stomach (6.3% and 7.8%), lung (6.1 and 7.3%) ranked fifth in cancer sites. There was a 17.6% increase in the detection rate of malignancy among the first identified patients during prophylactic medical examinations and and a 10.2% increase among all actively detected patients in 2014 versus 2013. The older age groups exhibited a rise in cancer detection rates, the most significant (11.8%) increase being in the women older than 60 years of age.  Conclusion:   The malignancy detection rates were noted to be on the rise, although there are defects in organizing prophylactic medical examination, ensuring the complete scope of necessary investigations, and interpreting the findings. The measures methodically supported a by regional cancer may provide a guide to solving these problems.

We used 2,2β'-(propane-2,2-diylbis(oxy))-diethanamine to react with the carboxylic acid groups of the central PAA block forming acid-labile, shell cross-linked micelles (SCLM). We investigated the loading efficiency and release of different guest molecules from non-cross-linked micelles (NSCLM) and shell cross-linked micelles (SCLM) prepared by reacting 50% (SCLM-50) and 100% (SCLM-100) of the carboxylic acid groups in the PAA in physiologic (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 5.0) buffer solutions as a function of time. We examined the uptake of NR-loaded NSCLM, SCLM-50, and SCLM-100 micelles into PC-3 and C4-2B prostate cancer cells and the effect of different micelle compositions on membrane fluidity of both cell lines. We also investigated the effect of CTX-loaded NSCLM, SCLM-50, and SCLM-100 micelles on the viability of PC-3 and C4-2B cancer cells compared to free CTX as a function of drug concentration.

Osteocytes constitute over 90% of adult bone cells. They orchestrate bone remodelling through determining osteoclast activity and affecting osteoblasts. The osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network is also intimately associated with the blood vessel network in the bone matrix. However, the roles of osteocytes in cancer cell invasion and metastasis remain unknown.  Materials and methods:   In this study, we investigated the effects of early osteocytes on the behaviour of breast and prostate cancer cells. The proliferation of cultured cells was assessed using the AlamarBlue assay. The electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system was used to measure spreading, attachment and migratory behaviour of cancer cells in response to conditioned medium (CM) from mouse osteocytes. Other cell assays, including in vitro wound healing and transwell migration/invasion assays, were also applied to evaluate the effect of osteocytes on cancer cells.  Results:   We found that CM from osteocytes from both monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) cultures, stimulated proliferation of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells but not LNCaP cells compared to control medium. Osteocyte CM also stimulated proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, osteocyte CM promoted the migration and adhesion of PC3 and DU145 in prostate cancer cells but had the reverse effect on PZHPV7, a normal prostate epithelial cell line. In the breast cancer cells studied, osteocyte CM inhibited post-wound migration of MCF-7 and ZR-75.1 cells but not MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, osteocyte CM stimulated transwell chemotactic migration of MDA-MB-231 cells but not of MCF-7 and ZR-75.1 cells.

Recently, knockdown of PSMA was linked to a decrease in MDM2 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and an increase in MMP3 and MMP13 expression. We aimed to assess the link between PSMA, MDM2 and the MMPs in metastatic breast cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting were used to assess siRNA-mediated knockdown of MDM2 and PSMA in MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75.1 breast cancer cells. Assays to assess the growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of the cells following siRNA treatment were undertaken. MMP and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) levels were assessed via quantitative PCR.  Results:   Knockdown of MDM2 resulted in a decrease in PSMA expression levels and vice versa; although this trend was not replicated at the protein level.

Efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment remain a major focus and have been proven beneficial in the approach to localised disease. However, currently, metastatic disease management still remains palliative. Receptor activator of nuclear kappa B (RANK) has been extensively studied in bone biology and immunology, whilst several links have been made between RANK-positive breast cancer cells and disease progression. Its role in prostate cancer biology remains poorly understood, therefore the aim of this study was to explore the functional role of endogenously produced RANK in metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cells in isolation and in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).  Materials and methods:   RANK expression was targeted using hammerhead ribozyme technology in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, and verified by polymerase chain reaction and western blot. A variety of in vitro functional assays were conducted, including cell proliferation and matrix adhesion in the presence of HGF.  Results:   Suppression of RANK expression was successfully targeted with anti-RANK hammerhead ribozyme transgenes, as verified by PCR and western blot. Reduced RANK expression resulted in significantly increased PC-3 cell proliferation (p<0.01) and cell-matrix adhesion (p<0.05) compared to control cells.  Conclusion:   Previous work into RANK and prostate cancer has focused on its interaction with the bone environment, particularly with regard to its receptor RANK ligand. This study has shown that endogenous RANK expression changes might also influence prostate cancer cell behaviour.

Patients and methods:   A total of 819 patients staged: (1) cT1b-c, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 10 ng/mL or Gleason ≥ 7, or (2) cT2a (International Union Against Cancer TNM 1997), with no involvement of pelvic lymph nodes and no clinical evidence of metastatic spread, with PSA ≤ 50 ng/mL, were centrally randomized 1:1 to either RT or RT plus AS started on day 1 of RT. Centers opted for one dose (70, 74, or 78 Gy). Biochemical DFS, the primary end point, was defined from entry until PSA relapse (Phoenix criteria) and clinical relapse by imaging or death of any cause. The trial had 80% power to detect hazard ratio (HR), 0.714 by intent-to-treat analysis stratified by dose of RT at the two-sided α = 5%.  Results:   The median patient age was 70 years. Among patients, 74.8% were intermediate risk and 24.8% were high risk. In the RT arm, 407 of 409 patients received RT; in the RT plus AS arm, 403 patients received RT plus AS and three patients received RT only. At 7.2 years median follow-up, RT plus AS significantly improved biochemical DFS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.66; P < .001, with 319 events), as well as clinical progression-free survival (205 events, HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.84; P = .001).

Nevertheless, pumpkin research provides insufficient data to back up traditional beliefs of ethnomedical practice. The bioactivity of a hydro-ethanolic extract of pumpkin seeds from the Styrian pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo var. styriaca, was investigated. As pumpkin seed extracts are standardized to cucurbitin, this compound was also tested. Transactivational activity was evaluated for human androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor with in vitro yeast assays. Cell viability tests with prostate cancer cells, breast cancer cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and a hyperplastic cell line from benign prostate hyperplasia tissue were performed. As model for non-hyperplastic cells, effects on cell viability were tested with a human dermal fibroblast cell line (HDF-5). No transactivational activity was found for human androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, for both, extract and cucurbitin. A cell growth inhibition of ~40-50% was observed for all cell lines, with the exception of HDF-5, which showed with ~20% much lower cell growth inhibition. Given the receptor status of some cell lines, a steroid-hormone receptor independent growth inhibiting effect can be assumed. The cell growth inhibition for fast growing cells together with the cell growth inhibition of prostate-, breast- and colon cancer cells corroborates the ethnomedical use of pumpkin seeds for a treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. Moreover, due to the lack of androgenic activity, pumpkin seed applications can be regarded as safe for the prostate.""","""['Svjetlana Medjakovic', 'Stefanie Hobiger', 'Karin Ardjomand-Woelkart', 'Franz Bucar', 'Alois Jungbauer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Fitoterapia""","""['Inhibition of testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate of sprague-dawley rats by pumpkin seed oil.', 'Evaluation of Anthelmintic Activity and Composition of Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.)

We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D, prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and -2proPSA using a commercially available immunoassay system.

Results:   The 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were not associated with Gleason grade according to the 2014 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) consensus conference Gleason grading system. PHI values were higher with increasing Gleason grade. Median 25-hydroxyvitamin D did not differ between men with prostate cancer vs no evidence of malignancy (50.6 vs 48.2 nmol/l, p = 0.192) or in ISUP Gleason subgroups despite seasonal variations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. However, PHI values significantly differed between the subgroup with no evidence of malignancy and all Gleason subgroups (p <0.0001). The ROCs of all men revealed an advantage of PHI over 25-hydroxyvitamin D (AUC 0.78 vs 0.535, p <0.0001). PHI could also significantly better separate patients with no evidence of malignancy from those with nonaggressive disease (ISUP Gleason grade 1) from those with aggressive prostate cancer (ISUP Gleason grades 2-5).

Parker is known for its medicinal uses in multiple ailments. In this study, we performed bioassay-guided fractionation of cytotoxic compounds from A. hydaspica and investigated their effects on growth and signaling activity in prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Four active polyphenolic compounds were identified as 7-O-galloyl catechin (GC), catechin (C), methyl gallate (MG), and catechin-3-O-gallate (CG). The four compounds inhibited prostate cancer PC-3 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas CG and MG inhibited breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell growth. All tested compounds inhibited cell survival and colony growth in both cell lines, and there was evidence of chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and apoptotic bodies. Further, acridine orange, ethidium bromide, propidium iodide and DAPI staining demonstrated that cell death occurred partly via apoptosis in both PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In PC-3 cells treatment repressed the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin, coupled with down-regulation of signaling pathways AKT, NFκB, ERK1/2 and JAK/STAT. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment induced reduction of CK2α, Bcl-xL, survivin and xIAP protein expression along with suppression of NFκB, JAK/STAT and PI3K pathways.

Biomarkers to tailor therapy are scarce. To facilitate decision-making we evaluated dynamic changes of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) under therapy with Abiraterone.  Methods:   Men with bone mCRPC (bmCRPC) on Abiraterone 12/2009-01/2014 were analyzed. Dynamic ALP-, LDH- and PSA-changes were analyzed as predictors of best clinical benefit and overall survival (OS) with logistic-regression, Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier-analysis.  Results:   Thirty-nine pre- and 45 post-chemotherapy patients with a median follow up of 14.0 months were analyzed. ALP-Bouncing can be observed very early during therapy with Abiraterone. ALP-Bouncing is defined as rapidly rising ALP-levels independent of baseline ALP during the first 2-4 weeks of Abiraterone-therapy with subsequent equally marked decline to pretreatment levels or better within 8 weeks of therapy, preceding potentially delayed PSA-decline. In univariate analysis failure of PSA-reduction ≥ 50% and failure of ALP-Bouncing were the strongest predictors of progressive disease (p = 0.003 and 0.021). Rising ALP at 12 weeks, no PSA-reduction ≥ 50% and no ALP-Bouncing were strongest predictors of poor OS, (all p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier-analysis showed worse OS for rising ALP at 12 weeks, no PSA-reduction ≥ 50% and no ALP-Bouncing (p < 0.001). In subgroup-analysis of oligosymptomatic patients all parameters remained significant predictors of poor OS, with no PSA-reduction ≥ 50% and rising ALP at 12 weeks being the strongest (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis PSA-reduction ≥ 50% remained an independent predictor of OS for the whole cohort and for the oligosymptomatic subgroup (both p = 0.014). No patient with ALP-Bouncing had PD for best clinical benefit. Patients with rising ALP at 12 weeks had no further benefit of Abiraterone.  Conclusions:   Dynamic changes of ALP, LDH and PSA during Abiraterone-therapy are associated with best clinical benefit and OS in bmCRPC. ALP-Bouncing occurring earlier than PSA-changes as well as prior to equivocal imaging results and rising ALP at 12 weeks under Abiraterone may help to decide whether to discontinue Abiraterone. An external validation of these findings on a prospective cohort is planned.""","""['Phillip Mikah', 'Laura-Maria Krabbe', 'Okyaz Eminaga', 'Edwin Herrmann', 'Philipp Papavassilis', 'Reemt Hinkelammert', 'Axel Semjonow', 'Andres-Jan Schrader', 'Martin Boegemann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The prognostic potential of alkaline phosphatase and lactic acid dehydrogenase in bmCRPC patients without significant PSA response under enzalutamide.', 'ALP bouncing and LDH normalization in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients under therapy with Enzalutamide: an exploratory analysis.', 'Systemic immune-inflammation index predicts the combined clinical outcome after sequential therapy with abiraterone and docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Alkaline phosphatase in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: reassessment of an older biomarker.', 'Use of abiraterone acetate in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and no prior chemotherapy: 3 case reports and literature review.', 'The prognostic potential of alkaline phosphatase and lactic acid dehydrogenase in bmCRPC patients without significant PSA response under enzalutamide.', 'ALP bouncing and LDH normalization in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients under therapy with Enzalutamide: an exploratory analysis.', 'The Alkaline Phosphatase Flare Phenomenon: A Transient Substantial Increase in Alkaline Phosphatase Concentration in a Prostate Cancer Patient after Starting GnRH Agonist Treatment.', 'Effects of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on bone turnover markers in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients after ADT failure: A prospective analysis of the italian real-world study ABITUDE.', 'Prognostic value of ECOG performance status and Gleason score in the survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

However, studies have shown that prognoses (e.g., progression and mortality) differ even among individuals with similar clinical and pathological characteristics. Existing risk classifiers (TMN grading system, Gleason score, etc.) are not accurately enough to represent the biological features of PCa. Using new genomic technologies, novel biomarkers and classifiers have been developed and shown to add value to clinical or pathological risk factors for predicting aggressive disease. Among them, RNA testing (gene expression analysis) is useful because it can not only reflect genetic variations but also reflect epigenetic regulations. Commercially available RNA profiling tests (Oncotype Dx, Prolaris, and Decipher) have demonstrated strong abilities to discriminate PCa with poor prognosis from less aggressive diseases. For instance, these RNA profiling tests can predict disease progression in active surveillance patients or early recurrence after radical treatments.

However, whether serum testosterone levels, using a cut-off point of 50 ng dl-1 , are related to the effective time of ADT in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients remains controversial. Moreover, recent studies have shown that some patients may benefit from the addition of upfront docetaxel chemotherapy. To date, no studies have been able to distinguish patients who will benefit from the combination of ADT and docetaxel chemotherapy. This study included 206 patients who were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer and showed progression to castrate-resistance prostate cancer (CRPC). Serum testosterone levels were measured prospectively after ADT for 1, 3, and 6 months. The endpoint was the time to CRPC. In univariate and multivariate analyses, testosterone levels <50 ng dl-1 were not associated with the effective time of ADT. Receiver operating characteristic and univariate analysis showed that testosterone levels of ≤25 ng dl-1 after the first month of ADT offered the best overall sensitivity and specificity for prediction of a longer time to CRPC (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.08-1.96; P = 0.013). Our results show that serum testosterone level of 25 ng dl-1 plays a prognostic role in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT. A testosterone value of 25 ng dl-1 after the first month of ADT can distinguish patients who benefit from ADT effectiveness for only a short time.

In some cancers, notably carcinomas, PRL-3 is also associated with inferior prognosis and increased metastatic potential. In this study we investigated the expression of PRL-3 mRNA in fresh-frozen samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy because of prostate cancer (PC) and the biological function of PRL-3 in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Samples from 41 radical prostatectomy specimens (168 samples in total) divided into low (Gleason score ≤ 6), intermediate (Gleason score = 7) and high (Gleason score ≥ 8) risk were analyzed with gene expression profiling and compared to normal prostate tissue. PRL-3 was identified as a gene with differential expression between healthy and cancerous tissue in these analyses. We used the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 and a small molecular inhibitor of PRL-3 to investigate whether PRL-3 had a functional role in cancer. Relative ATP-measurement and thymidine incorporation were used to assess the effect of PRL-3 on growth of the cancer cells. We performed an in vitro scratch assay to investigate the involvement of PRL-3 in migration. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PRL-3 protein in prostate cancer primary tumor and corresponding lymph node metastases.  Results:   Compared to normal prostate tissue, the prostate cancer tissue expressed a significantly higher level of PRL-3. We found PRL-3 to be present in both PC3 and DU145, and that inhibition of PRL-3 led to growth arrest and apoptosis in these two cell lines. Inhibition of PRL-3 led to reduced migration of the PC3 cells. Immunohistochemistry showed PRL-3 expression in both primary tumor and corresponding lymph node metastases.  Conclusions:   PRL-3 mRNA was expressed to a greater extent in prostate cancer tissue compared to normal prostate tissue.

Although bone marrow core biopsies (BMBx) can be obtained for gene profiling, the procedure itself is invasive and uncommon practice in mCRPC patients. Conversely, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are likely to stem from bone metastases, can be isolated from blood. The goals of this exploratory study were to establish a sensitive methodology to analyze gene expression in BMBx and CTCs, and to determine whether the presence or absence of detectable gene expression is concordant in matching samples from mCRPC patients.  Methods:   The CellSearch(®) platform was used to enrich and enumerate CTCs. Low numbers of PC3 prostate cancer (PCa) cells were spiked into normal blood to assess cell recovery rate. RNA extracted from recovered PC3 cells was amplified using an Eberwine-based procedure to obtain antisense mRNA (aRNA), and assess the linearity of the RNA amplification method. In this pilot study, RNAs extracted from CTCs and PCa cells microdissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded BMBx, were amplified to obtain aRNA and assess the expression of eight genes functionally relevant to PCa bone metastasis using RT-PCR.  Results:   RNAs were successfully extracted from as few as 1-5 PCa cells in blood samples. The relative expression levels of reference genes were maintained after RNA amplification. The integrity of the amplified RNA was also demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis using primer sets that target the 5'-end, middle, and 3'-end of reference mRNA. We found that in 21 out of 28 comparisons, the presence or absence of detectable gene expression in CTCs and PCa cells microdissected from single bone lesions of the same patients was concordant.  Conclusions:   This exploratory analysis suggests that aRNA amplification through in vitro transcription may be useful as a method to detect gene expression in small numbers of CTCs and tumor cells microdissected from bone metastatic lesions. In some cases, gene expression in CTCs and BMBxs was not concordant, raising questions about using CTC gene expression to make clinical decisions.""","""['Won Jin Cho', 'Daniel S M Oliveira', 'Abdo J Najy', 'Leandro E Mainetti', 'Hussein D Aoun', 'Michael L Cher', 'Elisabeth Heath', 'Hyeong-Reh C Kim', 'R Daniel Bonfil']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Multigene Profiling of CTCs in mCRPC Identifies a Clinically Relevant Prognostic Signature.', 'Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A report from the PETRUS prospective study.', 'Phenotypic diversity of circulating tumour cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The use of circulating tumor cells in guiding treatment decisions for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Using circulating tumor cells to inform on prostate cancer biology and clinical utility.', 'microRNA Prognostic Signature for Postoperative Success of Metastatic Orthopedic Cancers: Implications for Precision Microsurgery.', 'Prostate-specific markers to identify rare prostate cancer cells in liquid biopsies.', 'Circulating tumor cells mirror bone metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer.', 'Concise Review: Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Current Understanding.', 'Perspective on Cancer Therapeutics Utilizing Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   One hundred thirty-nine consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence after curative (surgery and/or radiotherapy) therapy were offered participation in this sequential clinical imaging approach. Patients first underwent an F-choline-PET/CT. If negative, an additional Ga-PSMA-PET/CT was offered. One hundred twenty-five of 139 eligible patients were included in the study; 32 patients underwent additional Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. Patients with equivocal findings (n = 5) on F-choline-PET/CT and those who declined the additional Ga-PSMA-PET/CT (n = 9) were excluded. Images were analyzed visually for the presence of suspicious lesions. Findings on PET/CT were correlated with PSA level, PSA doubling time (dt), and PSA velocity (vel).  Results:   The overall detection rates were 85.6% (107/125) for the sequential imaging approach and 74.4% (93/125) for F-choline-PET/CT alone. Ga-PSMA-PET/CT detected sites of recurrence in 43.8% (14/32) of the choline-negative patients.

Treatment with DMDP-1 & -2 resulted in cell death in a time and dose dependent manner in an MTT assay on all cancer cell lines tested with the exception of lung adenocarcinoma cells. DMDP-1 showed highest cytotoxic efficacy in PC-3 cells while DMDP-2 was most potent in DU 145 cells. Flow cytometry indicated that both coumarins were successful to induce programmed cell death after 24 h treatment. Elucidation on the mode-of-action via protein arrays and western blotting demonstrated death induced without any significant expressions of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins and cleaved PARP, thus suggesting the involvement of caspase-independent pathways. In identifying autophagy, analysis of GFP-LC3 showed increased punctate in PC-3 cells pre-treated with CQ and treated with DMDP-1. In these cells decreased expression of autophagosome protein, p62 and cathepsin B further confirmed autophagy. In contrary, the DU 145 cells pre-treated with CQ and treated with DMDP-2 has reduced GFP-LC3 punctate although the number of cells with obvious GFP-LC3 puncta was significantly increased in the inhibitor-treated cells. The increase level of p62 suggested leakage of cathepsin B into the cytosol to trigger potential downstream death mediators. This correlated with increased expression of cathepsin B and reduced expression after treatment with its inhibitor, CA074. Also auto-degradation of calpain-2 upon treatment with DMDP-1 &-2 and its inhibitor alone, calpeptin compared with the combination treatment, further confirmed involvement of calpain-2 in PC-3 and DU 145 cells. Treatment with DMDP-1 & -2 also showed up-regulation of total and phosphorylated p53 levels in a time dependent manner. Hence, DMDP-1 & -2 showed ability to activate multiple death pathways involving autophagy, lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum death proteins which could potentially be manipulated to develop anti-cancer therapy in apoptosis resistant cells.""","""['Noor Shahirah Suparji', 'Gomathi Chan', 'Hani Sapili', 'Norhafiza M Arshad', 'Lionel L A In', 'Khalijah Awang', 'Noor Hasima Nagoor']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Geranylated 4-phenylcoumarins extracted from Mesua elegans induced caspase-independent cell death in prostate cancer cell lines through calpain-2 and cathepsin B.', 'Isomahanine induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and simultaneously triggers p38\xa0MAPK-mediated apoptosis and autophagy in multidrug-resistant human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagic and apoptotic cell death, and immune activation by a natural triterpenoid in human prostate cancer cells.', ""The pepper's natural ingredient capsaicin induces autophagy blockage in prostate cancer cells."", 'The roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway in quercetin-mediated cell death of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract, immunepotent CRP, synergically enhances cyclophosphamide-induced breast cancer cell death, through a caspase-independent mechanism.', 'Caspase-Independent Regulated Necrosis Pathways as Potential Targets in Cancer Management.', 'A Coumarin-Based Analogue of Thiacetazone as Dual Covalent Inhibitor and Potential Fluorescent Label of HadA in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.', 'Alkynoates as Versatile and Powerful Chemical Tools for the Rapid Assembly of Diverse Heterocycles under Transition-Metal Catalysis: Recent Developments and Challenges.', 'Polyphenol-Mediated Autophagy in Cancer: Evidence of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.']"""

Data from the national Cancer Registry were linked to the study participants. A total of 1431 persons with haemophilia and 7150 matched controls were enrolled. Between the years 1972 and 2008, 164 malignancies were reported. The most common type of cancer among patients was prostate cancer, followed by haematologic malignancies, including lymphoma and leukaemia, which were significantly more frequent in patients [n = 35 (2.4%) vs. n = 60 (0.8%); P < 0.001]. Malignancies in bladder and other urinary organs were also significantly different [n = 21 (1.5%) vs. n = 46 (0.6%); P < 0.01]. The overall incidence rate ratio of malignancies per 1000 person-years compared to the controls was 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 1.6]. In subgroup analysis, the corresponding incidence rate ratios per 1000 person-years for persons with severe haemophilia was 1.7 (95% CI 0.9, 3.1) and that for mild/moderate haemophilia 1.1 (95% CI 0.8, 1.5). Swedish persons with haemophilia had a significantly higher incidence of malignant diseases than controls. These were primarily haematologic malignancies and cancer in urinary organs, and the difference independent of any co-infections with HIV and/or viral hepatitis.

Material and methods:   Retrospective data from 6,678 patients treated with a RP and bilateral lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer (PC) from 8 centers were collected. The primary endpoint was BCR.  Results:   Overall, 767 patients (11.5%) had LVI. Patients with LVI had significantly higher Gleason scores (P = 0.01). After a median follow-up of 28 months (interquartile range: 21-44), patients with LVI had a 1.66 fold increased risk of BCR (P<0.001). The 1-, 2- and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival probabilities for LVI vs. no LVI were 94% vs. 97%, 91% vs. 94%, and 76% vs. 84%, respectively. On multivariable analysis that adjusted for the effects of established prognostic factors, LVI was an independent predictor of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.42, P<0.001). Adding LVI to a multivariable base model increased the discrimination by a small but significant margin (+0.2%, P = 0.0005). In subgroup analyses, LVI remained an independent predictor for BCR in patients with worse pathological features.  Conclusions:   About 10% of patients with localized PC have LVI on their RP specimen.

The frequent overexpression of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors in prostate cancer stimulated the development of radiolabeled bombesin derivatives as high affinity peptide ligands for selective targeting of the GRP receptor. In this study, we have evaluated a novel (68)Ga-labeled bombesin derivative for PET imaging of prostate cancer in vivo. In addition, we were interested in testing the recently proposed ""serve-and-protect"" strategy to improve metabolic stability of radiolabeled peptides in vivo and to enhance tumor uptake. GRP receptor targeting peptides NOTA-BBN2 and (nat)Ga-NOTA-BBN2 demonstrated a characteristic antagonistic profile and high binding affinity toward the GRP receptor in PC3 cells (IC50 4.6-8.2 nM). Radiolabeled peptide (68)Ga-NOTA-BBN2 was obtained from NOTA-BBN2 in radiochemical yields greater than 62% (decay-corrected). Total synthesis time was 35 min, including purification using solid-phase extraction. (68)Ga-NOTA-BBN2 exhibited favorable resistance against metabolic degradation by peptidases in vivo within the investigated time frame of 60 min. Interestingly, metabolic stability was not further enhanced in the presence of protease inhibitor phosphoramidon. Dynamic PET studies showed high tumor uptake in both PC3- and LNCaP-bearing BALB/c nude mice (SUV5min > 0.6; SUV60min > 0.5). Radiotracer (68)Ga-NOTA-BBN2 represents a novel radiometal-based bombesin derivative suitable for GRP receptor targeting in PC3 and LNCaP mouse xenografts. Further increase of metabolic stability in vivo and enhanced tumor uptake were not observed upon administration of protease inhibitor phosphoramidon.

Off-line image verification was defined as images obtained before treatment and then reviewed by the physician before the next treatment.  Results:   Of 601 evaluable responses, 95% reported IGRT capabilities other than portal imaging. The majority (92%) used volumetric imaging (cone-beam CT [CBCT] or megavoltage CT), with volumetric imaging being the most commonly used modality for all sites except breast.

We investigated whether treatment at a radiation facility that treats a high volume of prostate cancer patients is associated with improved survival for men with high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identity patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2006. The radiation case volume (RCV) of each hospital was based on its number of radiation-treated prostate cancer patients. We used propensity-score based analysis to compare the overall survival (OS) of high-risk prostate cancer patients in high versus low RCV hospitals. Primary endpoint is overall survival. Covariates adjusted for were tumor characteristics, sociodemographic factors, radiation type, and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   A total of 19,565 radiation-treated high-risk patients were identified. Median follow-up was 81.0 months (range: 1-108 months). When RCV was coded as a continuous variable, each increment of 100 radiation-managed patients was associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-0.98; P<.0001) after adjusting for known confounders. For illustrative purposes, when RCV was dichotomized at the 80th percentile (43 patients/year), high RCV was associated with improved OS (7-year overall survival 76% vs 74%, log-rank test P=.0005; AHR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96, P=.0005). This association remained significant when RCV was dichotomized at 75th (37 patients/year), 90th (60 patients/year), and 95th (84 patients/year) percentiles but not the 50th (19 patients/year).

Methods:   In this cross-sectional study at a mean of 3 years after RALP at Oslo University Hospital, 982 men were invited to complete a mailed questionnaire, and 777 responded. Respondents who reported postoperative radiotherapy or hormone treatment, or did not report on orgasm were omitted, leaving 609 patients for analysis. Ability to reach orgasm was rated on 1 question from The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version, and dichotomized into ""good"" or ""poor.""  Results:   Overall, 27% of the men reported good ability to reach orgasm: 22% among those did not use erectile aids and 34% among those did (P = .001). Univariate analysis of men with good versus poor ability to reach orgasm showed many significant differences. In multivariate analysis, being older, having a reduced physical quality of life, and erectile dysfunction were significantly associated with poor ability to reach orgasm. Erectile dysfunction showed an odds ratio of 4.86 for poor orgasmic ability. The 48% of men who used erectile aids had significantly better orgasmic ability than the nonusers.  Conclusion:   In our sample, 27% had good ability to reach orgasm at a mean of 3 years after RALP.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is presented to be a highly promising new technique for N- and M-staging in recurrent PCa-patients. The actual investigation analyses the potential of (68)Ga-PSMA11-PET/CT to assess the extent of primary prostate cancer by intra-individual comparison to MP-MRI.  Methods:   In a retrospective study, ten patients with primary PCa underwent MP-MRI and PSMA-PET/CT for initial staging. All tumors were proven histopathological by biopsy. Image analysis was done in a quantitative (SUVmax) and qualitative (blinded read) fashion based on PI-RADS. The PI-RADS schema was then translated into a 3D-matrix and the euclidian distance of this coordinate system was used to quantify the extend of agreement.  Results:   Both MP-MRI and PSMA-PET/CT presented a good allocation of the PCa, which was also in concordance to the tumor location validated in eight-segment resolution by biopsy. An Isocontour of 50 % SUVmax in PSMA-PET resulted in visually concordant tumor extension in comparison to MP-MRI (T2w and DWI). For 89.4 % of sections containing a tumor according to MP-MRI, the tumor was also identified in total or near-total agreement (euclidian distance ≤1) by PSMA-PET. Vice versa for 96.8 % of the sections identified as tumor bearing by PSMA-PET the tumor was also found in total or near-total agreement by MP-MRI.  Conclusions:   PSMA-PET/CT and MP-MRI correlated well with regard to tumor allocation in patients with a high pre-test probability for large tumors.

Within the Danish 'Diet, Cancer and Health' cohort, including 27 179 men, we identified 784 cases with incident prostate cancer through 2007. Each case was risk set-matched to one control.

So far, however, there are only a few experimental platforms available that allow us to study these interactions systematically in a mechanically defined three-dimensional (3D) context. Here, we have studied the effect of integrin binding motifs found within common extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins on 3D breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3, LNCaP) cancer cell cultures, and co-cultures with endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells. For this purpose, matrix metalloproteinase-degradable biohybrid poly(ethylene) glycol-heparin hydrogels were decorated with the peptide motifs RGD, GFOGER (collagen I), or IKVAV (laminin-111). Over 14days, cancer spheroids of 100-200μm formed. While the morphology of poorly invasive MCF-7 and LNCaP cells was not modulated by any of the peptide motifs, the aggressive PC-3 cells exhibited an invasive morphology when cultured in hydrogels comprising IKVAV and GFOGER motifs compared to RGD motifs or nonfunctionalised controls. PC-3 (but not MCF-7 and LNCaP) cell growth and endothelial cell infiltration were also significantly enhanced in IKVAV and GFOGER presenting gels. Taken together, we have established a 3D culture model that allows for dissecting the effect of biochemical cues on processes relevant to early cancer progression. These findings provide a basis for more mechanistic studies that may further advance our understanding of how ECM modulates cancer cell invasion and how to ultimately interfere with this process.  Statement of significance:   Threedimensional in vitro cancer models have generated great interest over the past decade. However, most models are not suitable to systematically study the effects of environmental cues on cancer development and progression. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an innovative hydrogel platform to study the interactions between breast and prostate cancer cells and extracellular matrix ligands relevant to the tumour microenvironment. Our results show that hydrogels with laminin- and collagen-derived adhesive peptides induce a malignant phenotype in a cell-line specific manner. Thus, we have identified a method to control the incorporation of biochemical cues within a three dimensional culture model and anticipate that it will help us in better understanding the effects of the tumour microenvironment on cancer progression.""","""['Anna V Taubenberger', 'Laura J Bray', 'Barbara Haller', 'Artem Shaposhnykov', 'Marcus Binner', 'Uwe Freudenberg', 'Jochen Guck', 'Carsten Werner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Phenotypic characterization of prostate cancer LNCaP cells cultured within a bioengineered microenvironment.', 'Multi-parametric hydrogels support 3D in\xa0vitro bioengineered microenvironment models of tumour angiogenesis.', 'A three-dimensional spheroidal cancer model based on PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel microspheres.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Tissue-engineered three-dimensional tumor models to study tumor angiogenesis.', 'Application of three-dimensional cell culture technology in screening anticancer drugs.', 'The Variety of 3D Breast Cancer Models for the Study of Tumor Physiology and Drug Screening.', 'Cancer Spheroids and Organoids as Novel Tools for Research and Therapy: State of the Art and Challenges to Guide Precision Medicine.', 'Tumor microenvironment: barrier or opportunity towards effective cancer therapy.', 'Effect of Compressive Stress in Tumor Microenvironment on Malignant Tumor Spheroid Invasion Process.']"""

Method:   The cost-analysis was performed based on the data of a Hungarian oncology center from health care provider's perspective. Irradiation time was assessed from the data of 100 fractions delivered in 20 patients. Unit costs for each component were calculated based on actual costs retrieved from the accounting system of the oncology center.  Results:   Average treatment delivery times were 14.5 minutes for three-dimensional radiation therapy, 16.2 minutes for intensity-modulated radiation therapy with image-guided and 14 minutes without image-guided method. Expected mean cost of patients undergoing conventional three-dimensional radiation therapy, normal and hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy were 619 000 HUF, 933 000 HUF and 692 000 HUF, respectively.

Material and methods:   A cohort of 82 patients underwent endorectal mpMRI at 1.5T. Patients had at least one lesion with a PI-RADS v1 assessment category of ≥3 and were selected for targeted in-bore MR-guided biopsy in a subsequent session. The results of the histopathological workup were used as reference standard. All lesions were retrospectively evaluated according to PI-RADS v2 by an experienced and unexperienced blinded reader. Diagnostic performance was compared by analyzing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The weighted kappa method was used to calculate inter-reader reliability.  Results:   Targeted MR-guided biopsy was performed in 136 lesions and revealed 39 malignant lesions in 31 patients. AUC values increased for the experienced reader (PI-RADS v1 0.79; PI-RADS v2 0.83) and unexperienced reader (PI-RADS v1 0.70; PI-RADS v2 0.83). When excluding the cases of low grade cancer (Gleason score=3+3), AUC values increased further for the experienced reader (PI-RADS v1 0.88; PI-RADS v2 0.91) and unexperienced reader (PI-RADS v1 0.78; PI-RADS v2 0.90). Specificity at the selected threshold of a PI-RADS v1/v2 assessment category ≥4 improved for both readers. Inter-reader agreement increased from κ=0.55 in PI-RADS v1 to κ=0.68 in v2.  Conclusion:   PI-RADS v2 improved diagnostic performance for the assessment of suspicious intraprostatic lesions identified in PI-RADS v1 for both readers and led to higher inter-reader reliability.

Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a potent inhibitor of extracellular and intracellular androgen synthesis by inhibition of the CYP-17 enzyme system, which has been shown to be up-regulated in CRPC. AA was recently introduced in the management of patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) both before and after taxane-based chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to report the initial clinical experience obtained from mCRPC patients managed on AA at Rigshospitalet, Denmark, and compare the results with phase III trial outcomes.  Material and methods:   Single-centre, retrospective study including consecutive patients managed on AA for more than 2-year period. Treatment consisted of 1,000mg AA and 5mg prednisone twice daily. Outcomes of interest were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, clinical and radiological progression, and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 73 consecutive patients with mCRPC undergoing treatment with AA between November 2012 and October 2014 were included. Median follow-up was 9.9 (0.9-23.4) months. PSA decline>50% was found in 39% of the patients. Time to biochemical and radiological progression was 3.5 and 4.9 months, respectively. Overall survival was 13.2 months (95% CI: 9.0-17.4).  Conclusion:   Our initial experience with AA in the routine management of patients with mCRPC demonstrates an efficacy-effectiveness gap compared with clinical trial. Except for PSA response (>50% decline) in patients managed with AA, postchemotherapy results were inferior to phase III studies. This is most likely because of patient selection, which is a typical weakness when transferring results from phase III trials into clinical practice.""","""['Anita Thortzen', 'Stine Thim', 'Martin Andreas Røder', 'Klaus Brasso']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Abiraterone acetate for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after chemotherapy: final analysis of a multicentre, open-label, early-access protocol trial.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer - the unanticipated real-world clinical experience.', 'Use of abiraterone acetate in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and no prior chemotherapy: 3 case reports and literature review.', 'Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of abiraterone acetate for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes Following Abiraterone versus Enzalutamide for Prostate Cancer: A Scoping Review.', 'Effectiveness of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a large prospective real-world cohort: the ABItude study.', 'Clinical outcomes of abiraterone acetate and predictors of its treatment duration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Real-world experience in the Southeast Asian cohort.', 'Real-World Effectiveness of Palbociclib Versus Clinical Trial Results in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer That Progressed on Previous Endocrine Therapy.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) without prior use of chemotherapy: report from a large, international, real-world retrospective cohort study.']"""

Methods:   In this prospective, single-center, paired-patient, paired-reader study, 49 men with a clinical indication for MRI underwent non-ERC (phased-array coil only) T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging followed by the same sequences using both ERC and phased-array coils (ERC Protocol). Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 arms: standard non-ERC protocol and augmented non-ERC protocol. Lesions with Likert score≥3 were defined as suspicious for cancer. Radical prostatectomy specimen or combined systematic plus targeted biopsies served as the standard of reference. Cancers were stratified into risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Generalized estimating equations with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons. The level of reader confidence was inferred by the Likert scores assigned to index lesions.  Results:   The ERC protocol provided sensitivity (78%) superior to MRI without ERC for PCa detection, both with a standard (43%) (P<0.0001) or augmented (60%) (P<0.01) protocol.

In the present study, we investigated whether miRNAs have a distinct expression pattern in urine-EVs of prostate cancer (PCa) patients compared to control males. By next generation sequencing, we determined the miRNA expression in a discovery cohort of 4 control men and 9 PCa patients. miRNAs were validated by using a stemloop RT-PCR in an independent cohort of 74 patients (26 control and 48 PCa-patients). Whereas standard mapping protocols identified > 10 PCa associated miRNAs in urinary EVs, miR-21, miR-375 and miR-204 failed to robustly discriminate for disease in a validation study with RT-PCR-detection of mature miRNA sequences. In contrast, we observed that miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) with 3' end modifications were highly discriminatory between samples from control men and PCa patients. Highly differentially expressed isomiRs of miR-21, miR-204 and miR-375 were subsequently validated in an independent group of 74 patients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of three isomiRs, resulting in a 72.9% sensitivity with a high (88%) specificity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.866. In comparison, prostate specific antigen had an AUC of 0.707 and measuring the mature form of these miRNAs yielded a lower 70.8% sensitivity and 72% specificity (AUC 0.766).

The anatomy of the mouse prostate differs dramatically from the human prostate, being composed of four lobe pairs (anterior, dorsal, lateral, and ventral), making the identification and dissection technically challenging. Although the entire murine prostate and surrounding tissue, including urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and associated adipose tissue, can be quickly dissected for en bloc analysis, it is necessary to isolate individual prostate lobes for gene expression studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer. The procedure as described here includes full color images, allowing the researcher to appreciate the unique prostate morphology and tissue manipulation required to harvest individual prostate lobes. Along with removing all extraneous tissue, the procedure allows for direct comparison of the different prostate lobes by established downstream techniques. Importantly, high quality RNA required for next-generation gene expression analysis can only consistently be obtained from ventral and lateral lobes.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the second time SEER has published trends based on the early February submission. Three new cancer sites were added: cervix, thyroid, and liver/ intrahepatic bile duct.  Methods:   A reporting delay model adjusted for the undercount of cases, which is substantially larger for the February than the subsequent November submission, was used. Joinpoint regression methodology was used to assess trends. Delay-adjusted rates and trends were checked to assess validity between the February and November 2014 submissions.  Results:   The validation of rates and trends from the February and November 2014 submissions demonstrated even better agreement than the previously reported comparison between the February and November 2013 submissions, thereby affording additional confidence that the delay-adjusted February submission data can be used to produce valid estimates of incidence trends. Trends for cases diagnosed through 2013 revealed more rapid declines in female colon and rectal cancer and prostate cancer. A plateau in female melanoma trends and a slowing of the increases in thyroid cancer and male liver/intrahepatic bile duct cancer trends were observed.  Conclusions:   Analysis of early cancer data submissions can provide a preliminary indication of differences in incidence trends with an additional year of data. Although the delay adjustment correction adjusts for underreporting of cases, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results in this early submission.

PSA flare was defined as a transient PSA increase followed by a PSA decrease.  Results:   PSA flare was recognized in 7.0-23.9% of patients according to the definition used. Intriguingly, men with steroid intake before the initiation of docetaxel chemotherapy experienced significantly fewer PSA flares. The progression-free survival rate in men with PSA flare was equivalent to that of PSA responders, but significantly better than men with PSA failure.

FN1 is a synthetic curcumin analogue that shows stronger anticancer activity than curcumin in other reports. We aimed to explore the epigenetic modification of FN1 that restores Nrf2 expression in TRAMP-C1 cells. Stably transfected HepG2-C8 cells were used to investigate the effect of FN1 on the Nrf2- antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were applied to study the influence of FN1 on endogenous Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) were then performed to examine the methylation profile of the Nrf2 promoter. An anchorage-independent colony-formation analysis was conducted to examine the tumor inhibition activity of FN1. Epigenetic modification enzymes, including DNMTs and HDACs, were investigated by Western blotting. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that FN1 was more potent than curcumin in activating the Nrf2-ARE pathway. FN1 increased the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream detoxifying enzymes. FN1 significantly inhibited the colony formation of TRAMP-C1 cells. BGS and MeDIP assays revealed that FN1 treatment (250 nM for 3 days) reduced the percentage of CpG methylation of the Nrf2 promoter. FN1 also downregulated epigenetic modification enzymes. In conclusion, our results suggest that FN1 is a novel anticancer agent for prostate cancer. In the TRAMP-C1 cell line, FN1 can increase the level of Nrf2 and downstream genes via activating the Nrf2-ARE pathway and inhibit the colony formation potentially through the decreased expression of keap1 coupled with CpG demethylation of the Nrf2 promoter. This CpG demethylation effect may come from decreased epigenetic modification enzymes, such as DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and HDAC4.""","""['Wenji Li', 'Doug Pung', 'Zheng-Yuan Su', 'Yue Guo', 'Chengyue Zhang', 'Anne Yuqing Yang', 'Xi Zheng', 'Zhi-Yun Du', 'Kun Zhang', 'Ah-Ng Kong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chem Res Toxicol""","""['Curcumin Derivative Epigenetically Reactivates Nrf2 Antioxidative Stress Signaling in Mouse Prostate Cancer TRAMP C1 Cells.', 'Pharmacodynamics of curcumin as DNA hypomethylation agent in restoring the expression of Nrf2 via promoter CpGs demethylation.', 'Epigenetic reactivation of Nrf2 in murine prostate cancer TRAMP C1 cells by natural phytochemicals Z-ligustilide and Radix angelica sinensis via promoter CpG demethylation.', 'Curcumin Activates the Nrf2 Pathway and Induces Cellular Protection Against Oxidative Injury.', 'NRF2 modulation in TRAMP mice: an in vivo model of prostate cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and apoptosis induction and inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by Brassica oleracea var. acephala: An in vitro study.', 'Regulation of ferroptosis by noncoding RNAs: a novel promise treatment in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Nrf2 Regulation by Curcumin: Molecular Aspects for Therapeutic Prospects.', 'Bioactive Compounds in Oxidative Stress-Mediated Diseases: Targeting the NRF2/ARE Signaling Pathway and Epigenetic Regulation.']"""

Patients and methods:   Data from four open-label, fixed-dose studies were evaluated. Male patients aged 40-86 years with advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma, whom had not undergone prior androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), were treated with a depot formulation of ADSC-LA: 7.5 mg (1-month, 120 patients), 22.5 mg (3-month, 117 patients), 30 mg (4-month, 90 patients), or 45 mg (6-month, 111 patients). Serum testosterone was sampled at screening, baseline, 2, 4, 8 h after dosing, 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, and every week until the next dose, at which time, the sampling schedule repeated until the end of study (24 weeks for 1- and 3-month formulations, 32 weeks for 4-month, and 48 weeks for the 6-month). The primary analyses were mean serum testosterone concentrations and proportion of patients who achieved concentrations of ≤20 ng/dL.  Results:   The mean (SE) serum testosterone concentrations at the end of study were consistently ≤20 ng/dL in each study, at 6.1 (0.4), 10.1 (0.7), 12.4 (0.8), and 12.6 (2.1) ng/dL for the 1-, 3-, 4-, and 6-month formulations, respectively. A high proportion of patients (94%, 90%, 92%, 96% for the 1-, 3-, 4-, and 6-month formulations, respectively) achieved testosterone concentrations of ≤20 ng/dL within 6 weeks, and 90-97% of patients in all studies maintained concentrations of ≤20 ng/dL from weeks 6-24.  Conclusions:   Recent studies have shown improved outcomes in patients with prostate cancer who consistently attained a more rigorous level of testosterone suppression (≤20 ng/dL) with ADT than the historical standard (≤50 ng/dL). All doses of ADSC-LA rapidly achieved and maintained mean serum testosterone to the more rigorous target concentration of ≤20 ng/dL.

Although the mechanism through which vitamin D may increase risk is unknown, vitamin D concentration could influence circulating sex steroid hormones that may be associated with prostate cancer; an alternate explanation is that it could be associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration causing detection bias.  Objective:   We examined whether serum vitamin D concentration was associated with sex steroid hormone and PSA concentrations in a cross-sectional analysis of men in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES).  Design:   Testosterone, oestradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androstanediol glucuronide, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured in serum from men aged 20 and older participating in NHANES III (n = 1315) and NHANES 2001-2004 (n = 318). Hormone concentrations were compared across 25(OH)D quintiles, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body fat percentage, and smoking. PSA concentration was estimated by 25(OH)D quintile in 4013 men from NHANES 2001-2006.  Results:   In NHANES III, higher testosterone (quintile (Q) 1 = 17·2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 16·1-18·6; Q5 = 19·6, 95% CI = 18·7-20·6 nmol/l, P-trend = 0·0002) and SHBG (Q1 = 33·8, 95% CI = 30·8-37·0; Q5 = 38·4, 95% CI = 35·8-41·2 nmol/l, P-trend = 0·0005) were observed with increasing 25(OH)D. Similar results were observed in NHANES 2001-2004. PSA concentration was not associated with serum 25(OH)D (P-trend = 0·34).  Conclusion:   Results from these nationally representative studies support a positive association between serum 25(OH)D and testosterone and SHBG.

Recognizing that higher relative disparities are often found among less-common cancer sites, our analysis incorporated both relative and absolute measures of disparities. Fourteen of the 21 cancer sites analyzed were found to have significant variation by stage; in each instance, diagnosis at distant stage was more likely among residents of high-poverty areas. If the incidence rates found in the lowest-poverty areas for these 21 cancer sites were applied to the entire country, 18,000 fewer distant-stage diagnoses per year would be expected, a reduction of 8%. Conversely, 49,000 additional local-stage diagnoses per year would be expected, an increase of 4%.

These patients have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC); also, melanoma is frequently diagnosed among patients firstly diagnosed with an extracutaneous malignancy.  Objective:   We evaluated the risk of developing a SPC among 1537 melanoma patients, and the risk of second primary melanoma (SPM) in 52 354 extracutaneous cancer patients, who were treated at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during 2000-2010.  Material and methods:   We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) by applying gender-, age-, year- and region-specific reference rates to the follow-up time accrued between the diagnosis of the first and the second primary malignancies.  Results:   Seventy-six SPC were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 4 years, of which 49 (64%) during the first 2 years upon melanoma diagnosis. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (4.10, 95% CI 2.79-6.03), thyroid (4.67, 95% CI 1.94-11.22), brain (6.13, 95% CI 2.30-16.33) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.12, 95% CI 1.30-7.50). During a median follow-up of 4 years, 127 SPM were diagnosed: thick lesions were less frequent than for melanoma diagnosed as first cancer. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (5.13, 95%CI 3.91-6.73), thyroid (16.2, 95%CI: 5.22-50.2), head and neck (5.62, 95%CI 1.41-22.50), soft tissue (8.68, 95%CI 2.17-34.70), cervix (12.5, 95% CI 3.14-50.20), kidney (3.19, 95%CI 1.52-6.68), prostate (4.36, 95%CI 2.63-7.24) and acute myeloid leukaemia (6.44, 95%CI 2.42-17.20).  Conclusions:   The most likely causes of these associations are the clustering of lifestyle risk factors in the same subgroups of population, mainly on a sociocultural basis and surveillance bias.

They are traditionally chemoresistant with very limited treatment options in the metastatic setting. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a DNA β-herpes virus and it is characterized by persistent lifelong and latent infection. There is growing evidence to indicate the presence of HCMV proteins and nucleic acids in glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and a variety of solid organ malignancies of the breast, prostate, lung, and colon at very high prevalence. Immunotherapy-based clinical trials targeting specific cytomegalovirus proteins are currently in progress in the treatment of glioblastoma. Herein, we evaluated for the presence of HCMV proteins (IE1 and pp65), genes (US28 and UL96), and RNA in a cohort of ASPS. Six confirmed cases of ASPS were retrieved and full thickness sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material were stained for anti-HMCV-IE1 and anti-HCMV-pp65. Any nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining was considered positive. DNA was purified from 50 µm of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. One hundred nanogram of DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction for primers specific to HCMV-US28 (forward: AGCGTGCCGTGTACGTTAC and reverse: ATAAAGACAAGCACGACC) and HCMV-UL96 (forward: ACAGCTCTTAAAGGACGTGATGCG and reverse: ACCGTGTCCTTCAGCTCGGTTAAA) using Promega Taq polymerase. HCMV in situ hybridization was performed. All 6 cases of ASPS were positive for both HCMV-IE1 and HCMV-pp65. Usable DNA was available in 4 of the 6 cases. HCMV-US28 gene was found in 75% (3/4) of cases and HCMV-UL96 gene was detected in 50% (2/4) of cases. Importantly, all cases tested positive for at least 1 gene. HCMV-encoded RNA was identified in 80% (4/5) of cases.

It is hoped that through a better understanding of the alterations implicated in endometrial cancer pathogenesis and prognosis, a more complete profile of risk factors and targeted therapy can be developed. Hepsin is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family. The importance of hepsin in prostate cancer has been demonstrated by several studies. However, the role of hepsin in endometrial carcinoma is yet to be identified. This study aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of hepsin in endometrial carcinoma, trying to explore its diagnostic and prognostic value.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study was conducted on 27 endometrial carcinoma and 18 endometrial hyperplasia cases. Immunohistochemical expression of hepsin was evaluated in tissue specimens and results were correlated with the available clinicopathlogic parameters.  Results:   Positive hepsin expression was seen in all (100%) carcinoma and 17/18 (94.44%) endometrial hyperplasia cases. The H-score of hepsin expression in endometrial carcinoma was significantly higher than that of hyperplasia cases (P=0.012). A significant negative association was found between hepsin expression in endometrial carcinoma cases regarding the grade and the size of tumors (P=0.018 and 0.008, respectively) as well as myometrial invasion (P=0.027).  Conclusions:   Hepsin could play an important role in the pathogenesis and the early carcinogenesis of endometrial carcinoma and could serve as a prognostic biomarker in this tumor.""","""['Hala S El-Rebey', 'Mona A-H Kandil', 'Rehab M Samaka', 'Dalia R Al-Sharaky', 'Karim El Deeb']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['Expression of the serine protease hepsin and clinical outcome of human endometrial cancer.', ""Hepsin immunohistochemical expression in prostate cancer in relation to Gleason's grade and serum prostate specific antigen."", 'Hepsin inhibits the cell growth of endometrial cancer.', 'Hepsin and prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Significance of Hepsin and Underlying Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CD44, TGM2 and EpCAM as novel plasma markers in endometrial cancer diagnosis.']"""

Dysregulation of miRNA has been implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Through next generation miRNA sequencing, we recently identified a panel of five miRNAs associated with prostate cancer recurrence and metastasis. Of the five miRNAs, miR-301a had the strongest association with prostate cancer recurrence. Overexpression of miR-301a in prostate cancer cells, PC3, and LNCaP resulted in increased growth both in vitro and in xenografted tumors. We therefore sought to examine its role in prostate carcinogenesis in greater detail.  Methods:   We examined the effect of miR-301a expression on biochemical recurrence and metastasis among 585 men treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We examined the mechanism of growth deregulation by miR-301a in prostate cancer cells using analysis of the miRome of prostate cancer cell lines, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting.  Results:   High levels of miR-301a (above the median) were associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.90, P = 0.002) but not of metastasis (aHR 0.84, 95%CI 0.41-1.70, P = 0.6) after adjustment for known prognostic factors. RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of miR-301a overexpressing prostate cancer cell lines identified the tumor suppressor p63 as a potential direct miR-301a target. Transcriptome sequencing, qPCR and Western blotting showed that miR-301a induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells through a pathway initiated by p63 inhibition. Luciferase assay verified p63 as a direct target of miR-301a. Loss of p63 resulted in miR-205 downregulation, releasing Zeb1 and Zeb2 from inhibition, culminating in Zeb1/Zeb2 suppression of E-cadherin. This pathway of growth alteration mediated by miR-301a upregulation was shown to be valid in prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumors.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that miR-301a functions as an oncogene in prostate cancer by directly targeting the p63 tumor suppressor leading to loss of E-cadherin and EMT. Hence, miR-301a may serve as a novel biomarker in prostate cancer as well as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer management.

We hypothesized that ERG promotes the expression of common genes in primary PCa and metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), with the objective of identifying ERG-associated pathways, which may promote the transition from primary PCa to CRPC.  Methods:   We constructed tissue microarrays (TMA) from 127 radical prostatectomy specimens, 20 LuCaP patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 152 CRPC metastases obtained immediately at time of death. Nuclear ERG was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To characterize the molecular features of ERG-expressing PCa, a subset of IHC confirmed ERG+ or ERG- specimens including 11 radical prostatectomies, 20 LuCaP PDXs, and 45 CRPC metastases underwent gene expression analysis. Genes were ranked based on expression in primary PCa and CRPC. Common genes of interest were targeted for IHC analysis and expression compared with biochemical recurrence (BCR) status.  Results:   IHC revealed that 43% of primary PCa, 35% of the LuCaP PDXs, and 18% of the CRPC metastases were ERG+ (12 of 48 patients [25%] had at least one ERG+ metastasis). Based on gene expression data and previous literature, two proteins involved in calcium signaling (NCALD, CACNA1D), a protein involved in inflammation (HLA-DMB), CD3 positive immune cells, and a novel ERG-associated protein, DCLK1 were evaluated in primary PCa and CRPC metastases. In ERG+ primary PCa, a weak association was seen with NCALD and CACNA1D protein expression. HLA-DMB association with ERG was decreased and CD3 cell number association with ERG was changed from positive to negative in CRPC metastases compared to primary PCa. DCLK1 was upregulated at the protein level in unpaired ERG+ primary PCa and CRPC metastases (P = 0.0013 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In primary PCa, ERG status or expression of targeted proteins was not associated with BCR-free survival. However, for primary PCa, ERG+DCLK1+ patients exhibited shorter time to BCR (P = 0.06) compared with ERG+DCLK1- patients.  Conclusions:   This study examined ERG expression in primary PCa and CRPC. We have identified altered levels of inflammatory mediators associated with ERG expression. We determined expression of DCLK1 correlates with ERG expression and may play a role in primary PCa progression to metastatic CPRC.

Here, we show that the prostate cancer stem cell (pCSC)-like traits, such as accelerated activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), enrichment of CD49f+ fraction, and sphere forming efficiency, are attenuated by SFN treatment. Interestingly, the expression of c-Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor that is frequently deregulated in prostate cancer cells, was markedly suppressed by SFN both in vitro and in vivo. This is biologically relevant, because the lessening of pCSC-like phenotypes mediated by SFN was attenuated when c-Myc was overexpressed. Naturally occurring thio, sulfinyl, and sulfonyl analogs of SFN were also effective in causing suppression of c-Myc protein level. However, basal glycolysis, a basic metabolic pathway that can also be promoted by c-Myc overexpression, was not largely suppressed by SFN, implying that, in addition to c-Myc, there might be another SFN-sensitive cellular factor, which is not directly involved in basal glycolysis, but cooperates with c-Myc to sustain pCSC-like phenotypes. Our study suggests that oncogenic c-Myc is a target of SFN to prevent and eliminate the onset of human prostate cancer. J. Cell.

Using LNCaP prostate cancer cells as a model system, we have investigated proteases and tyrosine phosphorylation affecting β-dystroglycan proteolysis and nuclear targeting. Cell density or phorbol ester treatment increases dystroglycan proteolysis, whereas furin or γ-secretase inhibitors decreased dystroglycan proteolysis. Using resveratrol treatment of LNCaP cells cultured at low cell density in order to up-regulate notch and activate proteolysis, we identified significant increases in the levels of a 26 kDa β-dystroglycan fragment. These data, therefore, support a cell density-dependent γ-secretase and furin mediated proteolysis of β-dystroglycan, which could be notch stimulated, leading to nuclear targeting and subsequent degradation. 117: 2149-2157, 2016. © 2016 The Authors.

A systematic investigation of gold nanostar heat-generating efficiency in situ is presented: not only in cancer cells in vitro but also after intratumoral injection in vivo. It is demonstrated that (i) in aqueous dispersion, heat generation is governed by particle size and exciting laser wavelength; (ii) in cancer cells in vitro, heat generation is still very efficient, but irrespective of both particle size and laser wavelength; and (iii) heat generation by nanostars injected into tumors in vivo evolves with time, as the nanostars are trafficked from the extracellular matrix into endosomes.

We examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitor on PC3 prostate cancer cells under a fluorescence microscope and found that XL147-treated cancer cells are rapidly injured by blue wavelength (430 nm) light irradiation. During the irradiation, the cancer cells treated with 0.2-2 μM XL147 showed cell surface blebbing and cytoplasmic vacuolation and died within 15 min. The extent of cell injury/death was dependent on the dose of XL147 and the light power of the irradiation. These findings suggest that XL147 might act as a photosensitizing reagent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer. Moreover, the cytotoxic effect of photosensitized XL147 was reduced by pretreatment with other ATP-competitive PI3K inhibitors such as LY294002, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of photosensitized XL147 is facilitated by binding to PI3K in cells. In a single-cell illumination analysis using a fluorescent probe to identify reactive oxygen species (ROS), significantly increased ROS production was observed in the XL147-treated cells when the cell was illuminated with blue light. Taken together, it is conceivable that XL147, which is preferentially accumulated in cancer cells, could be photosensitized by blue light to produce ROS to kill cancer cells.

Intuitively, HPC is a serious subtype of prostate cancer but there are only limited data on the clinical phenotype of HPC. Here, we aimed to compare the prognosis of HPC to the sporadic form of prostate cancer (SPC).  Methods:   HPC patients were identified through a national registry of HPC families in the Netherlands, selecting patients diagnosed from the year 2000 onward (n = 324). SPC patients were identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) between 2003 and 2006 for a population-based study into the genetic susceptibility of PC (n = 1,664). Detailed clinical data were collected by NCR-registrars, using a standardized registration form. Follow-up extended up to the end of 2013. Differences between the groups were evaluated by cross-tabulations and tested for statistical significance while accounting for familial dependency of observations by GEE. Differences in progression-free and overall survival were evaluated using χ(2) testing with GEE in a proportional-hazards model.  Results:   HPC patients were on average 3 years younger at diagnosis, had lower PSA values, lower Gleason scores, and more often locally confined disease. Of the HPC patients, 35% had high-risk disease (NICE-criteria) versus 51% of the SPC patients. HPC patients were less often treated with active surveillance. Kaplan-Meier 5-year progression-free survival after radical prostatectomy was comparable for HPC (78%) and SPC (74%; P = 0.30). The 5-year overall survival was 85% (95%CI 81-89%) for HPC versus 80% (95%CI 78-82%) for SPC (P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   HPC has a favorable clinical phenotype but patients more often underwent radical treatment. The major limitation of HPC is the absence of a genetics-based definition of HPC, which may lead to over-diagnosis of PC in men with a family history of prostate cancer. The HPC definition should, therefore, be re-evaluated, aiming at a reduction of over-diagnosis and overtreatment among men with multiple relatives diagnosed with PC.

The AR mRNA has a 6.8 kb long 3'-untranslated region (UTR) which harbors several experimentally validated and numerous predicted miRNA binding sites. AR 3'-UTR is likely to positively or negatively regulate AR expression by interacting with miRNAs and possibly other trans-acting auxiliary factors including 3'-UTR RNA binding proteins. In this context, systematic understanding of the regulatory role of AR 3'-UTR in intrinsic post-transcriptional control of AR gene expression is of significance to understand AR related diseases including PCa.  Methods:   In this study, we have constructed a heterologous reporter system in which Firefly luciferase and AR expression is experimentally influenced by the presence of AR 3'-UTR and its interactions with ectopically expressing miRNA.  Results:   The expression of AR 3'-UTR containing reporters, including the Firefly luciferase and the AR open reading frame (ORF) were repressed by the overexpression of miR-488* mimics. In addition, the AR expressed from 3'-UTR containing expression vectors was fully functional in its transactivation function as determined by a prostate specific antigen (PSA) reporter assay. Further, by using confocal microscopy we also demonstrate that AR can translocate to the nucleus upon DHT activation confirming the functional ability of AR.  Conclusions:   AR transgenes with AR 3'-UTR fragments closely resemble the endogenous AR expression than any other previously characterized AR expression constructs. The 3'-UTR containing AR expression system is amiable to post-transcriptional manipulations including miRNA mediated repression of AR expression.

SIRT1 is over-expressed in CaP cells, however the associated mechanism is not well understood. To identify whether specific microRNAs might mediate this linkage, we have screened a miRNA library for differential expression in ERG-associated CaP tissues. Of 20 differentially and significantly expressed miRNAs that distinguish ERG-positive tumors from ERG-negative tumors, we find miR-449a is highly suppressed in ERG-positive tumors. We establish that SIRT1 is a direct target of miR-449a and is also induced by ERG in ERG-associated CaP. Our data suggest that attenuation of miR-449a promotes the invasive phenotype of the ERG-positive CaP in part by inducing the expression of SIRT1 in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we also find that suppression of SIRT1 results in a significant reduction in ERG expression in ERG-positive CaP cells, indicating a feed-back regulatory loop associated with ERG, miR-449a and SIRT1. We also report that ERG suppresses p53 acetylation perhaps through miR-449a-SIRT1 axis in CaP cells. Our findings provide new insight into the function of miRNAs in regulating ERG-associated CaP. Thus, miR-449a activation or SIRT1 suppression may represent new therapeutic opportunity for ERG-associated CaP.""","""['Parameet Kumar', 'Shashwat Sharad', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Ahmed Mohamed', 'Albert Dobi', 'Taduru L Sreenath', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Roopa Biswas']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['miR-449a targets HDAC-1 and induces growth arrest in prostate cancer.', 'miR-449a causes Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest and senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-449a enhances radiosensitivity through modulating pRb/E2F1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-449a: a potential therapeutic agent for cancer.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Study on the role of SLC14A1 gene in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-449a inhibits cell proliferation and migration by regulating mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'miR-449a Repression Leads to Enhanced NOTCH Signaling in TMPRSS2:ERG Fusion Positive Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Functional studies revealed both growth suppression and proapoptotic activities for GLIPR1 in multiple cancer cell lines. GLIPR1's role in lung cancer has not been investigated. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a protein arginine methyltransferase and forms a stoichiometric complex with the WD repeat domain 77 (WDR77) protein. Both PRMT5 and WDR77 are essential for growth of lung epithelial and cancer cells. But additional gene products that interact genetically or biochemichally with PRMT5 and WDR77 in the control of lung cancer cell growth are not characterized.  Methods:   DNA microarray and immunostaining were used to detect GLIPR1 expression during lung development and lung tumorigenesis. GLIPR1 expression was also analyzed in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. The consequence of GLIPR1 on growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in the nude mice was observed.  Results:   We found that GLIPR1 expression is negatively associated with PRMT5/WDR77. GLIPR1 is absent in growing epithelial cells at the early stages of mouse lung development and highly expressed in the adult lung. Expression of GLIPR1 was down-regulated during lung tumorigenesis and its expression suppressed growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in mice. GLIPR1 regulates lung cancer growth through the V-Erb-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3).

Furthermore, targeting DNA repair defects by PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) as a cancer treatment strategy is emerging yet requires suitable predictive biomarkers. To address these issues, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of multiple markers of DNA damage signalling, oxidative stress, DNA repair and cell cycle control pathways during progression of human prostate disease from benign hyperplasia, through intraepithelial neoplasia to CaP, complemented by genetic analyses of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and NQO1, an anti-oxidant factor and p53 protector. The DNA damage checkpoint barrier (γH2AX, pATM, p53) mechanism was activated during CaP tumorigenesis, albeit less and with delayed culmination compared to other cancers, possibly reflecting lower replication stress (slow proliferation despite cases of Rb loss and cyclin D1 overexpression) and progressive loss of ATM activator NKX3.1. Oxidative stress (8-oxoguanine lesions) and NQO1 increased during disease progression. NQO1 genotypes of 390 men did not indicate predisposition to CaP, yet loss of NQO1 in CaP suggested potential progression-opposing tumour suppressor role. TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss, events sensitizing to PARPi, occurred frequently along with heterogeneous loss of DNA repair factors 53BP1, JMJD1C and Rev7 (all studied here for the first time in CaP) whose defects may cause resistance to PARPi.

Aim:   The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of PSA testing in general practice and subsequent patterns of referral.  Design and setting:   Data obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) for men aged 45-84 years who had a PSA test during 2010-2011, registered in practices in England with linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data.

RNase L cleavage products are capable of activating RIG-like receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 that leads to IFN-β expression during viral infection.

Three clinical cases were studied: a low-risk prostate cancer case (case 1), a high-risk prostate cancer case (pelvic nodes, case 2) and a case of post-operative biochemical elevated PSA (case 3). All of the involved physicians delineated characteristically the clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk. The volumes were compared using validated indexes: the volume ratio (VR), common and additional volumes (CV and AV), volume overlap (VO) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). A second delineation of the same three cases was performed after discussion of the slice results and the choice of shared guidelines to evaluate homogenization. A comparative analysis of the indexes before and after discussion was conducted using the Wilcoxon test for paired samples.

We hypothesized that the antitumorigenic effects of metformin are mediated through upregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) expression in prostate cancer cells. In this report, metformin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of prostate cancer cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, Metformin markedly suppressed migration and invasion and induced apoptosis of both LNCaP and PC3 cancer cells. Metformin also reduced PC3 tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice in vivo. Furthermore, metformin treatment was associated with higher PEDF expression in both prostate cancer cells and tumor tissue. Taken together, metformin inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth, and these activities are mediated by upregulation of PEDF expression.

In this study, AT and TQ are investigated for their comparative effects on growth and androgenic activity in prostate cancer cells. TQ potently inhibited the growth of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines (e.g., LAPC4 and LNCaP cells), whereas the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (e.g., DU145 cells) was not affected by TQ. Due to the growth inhibitory effects induced by TQ on androgen-responsive cells, the anti-androgenic properties of TQ were examined. TQ inhibited the androgen-induced activation of an androgen-responsive reporter and inhibited the release of prostate specific antigen from LNCaP cells. TQ pretreatment was also found to inhibit AR activation as measured using the Multifunctional Androgen Receptor Screening assay. Furthermore, TQ decreased androgen-responsive gene expression, including TM4SF1, KLK2, and PSA over 5-fold, whereas AT did not affect the expression of androgen-responsive genes. Of importance, the antiandrogenic effects of TQ on prostate cancer cells were found to result from androgen receptor protein down-regulation produced by TQ that was not observed with AT treatment. Moreover, none of the androgenic endpoints assessed were affected by AT. The down-regulation of androgen receptor protein by TQ was abrogated by co-treatment with antioxidants.

Previous study has shown that LGR4 may be a new responsive gene of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cancer progression. In the present study, we established the LNCaP-IL-6+ cell subline by long-term incubation with a low concentration of IL-6 and explored the regulatory role of miR-218, a tumor-suppressing miRNA, in IL-6-induced LGR4 expression and LNCaP-IL-6+ cell proliferation and invasion. The results showed that miR-218 expression was gradually decreased and IL-6 expression was gradually increased in the process of prostate cancer progression from normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia to prostate cancer, and from LNCaP to LNCaP-IL-6+ cells. Notably, we also found that miR-218 inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin A1 and invasion-related matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein induced by IL-6, and impeded the accelerative effect of IL-6 on LNCaP-IL-6+ cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell invasion. Moreover, our results confirmed that miR-218 directly targets LGR4 and modulated the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in the LNCaP-IL-6+ cells.

Aim:   To analyze recent hospital data of patients with metastatic epiduritis managed in the Abidjan neurosurgery department.  Methodology:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of files of 56 patients admitted from January 2007 through December 2012. Our data are discussed in the light of the literature.  Results:   The primary cancers in men were mostly lung (16%) and prostate (34%) cancers, and in women, breast cancer (23%). The two age brackets mainly involved were those aged 31-45 years (21%) and 46-60 years (39%). The reason for admission in all cases was functional disability of the lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for 57%. The thoracic topography was dominant (60%), and vertebral damage was often associated with epiduritis (78%). This metastatic epiduritis was the initial sign leading to cancer diagnosis for 39%. Decompressive laminectomy with biopsy or lesionectomy was performed for 62%. Postoperative neurologic improvement was noted for 36%, and remained satisfactory at one year for 14 patients. Prostate-specific hormone therapy was performed for 30%.

This DNA RNA hybridized aptamer antitumor agent was able to enhance the cytotoxicity of targeted cells while minimizing collateral damage to non-targeted cells. This SPIO-Apt-Dox nanoparticle has specificity to PSMA⁺ prostate cancer cells. Aptamer inhibited nonspecific uptake of membrane-permeable doxorubic to the non-target cells, leading to reduced untargeted cytotoxicity and endocytic uptake while enhancing targeted cytotoxicity and endocytic uptake.

Methods:   Within an ongoing prospective clinical trial, hybrid (18)F-choline PET/CT and multiparametric 3T MRI (mpMRI) of the pelvis were performed in 36 subjects with a rising prostate-specific antigen for known (n = 15) or suspected (n = 21) prostate cancer before a prostate biopsy procedure. PET and T2-weighted MR volumes of the prostate were spatially registered using commercially available software. Biopsy targets were selected on the basis of visual appearance on MRI and graded as low, intermediate, or high risk for significant disease. Volumes of interest were defined for MR-identified lesions. (18)F-choline uptake measures were obtained from the MR target and a mirrored background volume of interest. The biopsy procedure was performed after registration of real-time transrectal ultrasound with T2-weighted MR and included image-guided cores plus standard cores. Histologic results were determined from standard and targeted biopsy cores as well as prostatectomy specimens (n = 10).  Results:   Fifteen subjects were ultimately identified with Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 prostate cancer, of which targeted biopsy identified significantly more (n = 12) than standard biopsies (n = 5; P = 0.002). A total of 52 lesions were identified by mpMRI (19 low, 18 intermediate, 15 high risk), and mpMRI-assigned risk was a strong predictor of final pathology (area under the curve = 0.81; P < 0.001). When the mean (18)F-choline target-to-background ratio was used, the addition of (18)F-choline to mpMRI significantly improved the prediction of Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 cancers over mpMRI alone (area under the curve = 0.92; P < 0.001).

We retrospectively report our experience with (177)Lu-PSMA-617-targeted radionuclide therapy in a case series of mCRPC patients resistant to other treatments.  Methods:   Patients with PSMA-positive tumor phenotypes were selected by molecular imaging. Thirty patients received 1-3 cycles of (177)Lu-PSMA-617. During therapy, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry were evaluated. Blood cell count was checked every 2 wk after the first and every 4 wk after succeeding cycles. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was determined every 4 wk. Radiologic restaging was performed after 3 cycles.  Results:   Twenty-one of 30 patients had a PSA response; in 13 of 30 the PSA decreased more than 50%. After 3 cycles, 8 of 11 patients achieved a sustained PSA response (>50%) for over 24 wk, which also correlated with radiologic response (decreased lesion number and size). Normally, acute hematotoxicity was mild. Diffuse bone marrow involvement was a risk factor for higher grade myelosuppression but could be identified by PSMA imaging in advance. Xerostomia, nausea, and fatigue occurred sporadically (<10%). Clearance of non-tumor-bound tracer was predominantly renal and widely completed by 48 h. Safety dosimetry revealed kidney doses of approximately 0.75 Gy/GBq, red marrow doses of 0.03 Gy/GBq, and salivary gland doses of 1.4 Gy/GBq, irrespective of tumor burden and consistent on subsequent cycles.

To apply this representation and obtain the posterior probabilities over all alternative hypotheses, it is enough to have, for each test, barely defined Bayes Factors, e.g. Bayes Factors obtained up to an unknown constant. Such Bayes Factors may either arise from using default and improper priors or from calibrating p-values with respect to their corresponding Bayes Factor lower bound.

Given that tumor relapse can be attributed to a population of cancer stem cells (CSC) that survives radiotherapy, analysis of this cell population might illuminate tactics to personalize treatment. However, this direction remains challenging given the plastic nature of prostate cancers following treatment. We show here that irradiating prostate cancer cells stimulates a durable upregulation of stem cell markers that epigenetically reprogram these cells. In both tumorigenic and radioresistant cell populations, a phenotypic switch occurred during a course of radiotherapy that was associated with stable genetic and epigenetic changes. Specifically, we found that irradiation triggered histone H3 methylation at the promoter of the CSC marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), stimulating its gene transcription. Inhibiting this methylation event triggered apoptosis, promoted radiosensitization, and hindered tumorigenicity of radioresistant prostate cancer cells. Overall, our results suggest that epigenetic therapies may restore the cytotoxic effects of irradiation in radioresistant CSC populations.

In this study, RM1 cells were used to explore the atrazine effects on prostate cancer. Proliferation, migration and invasion of RM1 cells were assessed by colony formation, wound-healing and invasion assays, respectively, after in vitro exposure to atrazine. In addition, an RM1 cell xenograft model was generated to evaluate the effects of atrazine in vivo. To explore the molecular mechanisms, qRT‑PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analyses were employed to detect mRNA and protein levels of STAT3 signaling and cell cycle related proteins, including p53, p21, cyclin B1 and cyclin D1.

Interest on these isoforms has been recently fuelled by the identification of specific physiological roles for class II PI3Ks and by accumulating evidence indicating their involvement in human diseases. While it is now established that these isoforms can regulate distinct cellular functions compared to other PI3Ks, there is still a limited understanding of the signalling pathways that can be specifically regulated by class II PI3Ks.

The IC50 values were in the low nanomolar range, with lower IC50 values for positively charged natIn-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (2.6 ± 0.1 nM) and higher values for negatively charged natIn-DOTAGA-PEG2-RM26 (4.8 ± 0.5 nM). The kinetic binding studies showed KD values in the picomolar range that followed the same pattern as the IC50 data. The biodistribution of all compounds was studied in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies displayed rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood and normal organs via kidney excretion. All conjugates showed similar uptake in tumors at 4 h p.i. The radioactivity accumulation in GRPR-expressing organs was significantly lower for DOTA- and DOTAGA-containing constructs compared to those containing NOTA and NODAGA. 111In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 with a positively charged complex showed the highest initial uptake and the slowest clearance of radioactivity from the liver. At 4 h p.i., DOTA- and DOTAGA-coupled analogs showed significantly higher tumor-to-organ ratios compared to NOTA- and NODAGA-containing variants. The NODAGA conjugate demonstrated the best retention of radioactivity in tumors, and, at 24 h p.i., had the highest contrast to blood, muscle and bones.""","""['Bogdan Mitran', 'Zohreh Varasteh', 'Ram Kumar Selvaraju', 'Gunnar Lindeberg', 'Jens Sörensen', 'Mats Larhed', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Ulrika Rosenström', 'Anna Orlova']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Selection of an optimal macrocyclic chelator improves the imaging of prostate cancer using cobalt-labeled GRPR antagonist RM26.', 'Synthesis and characterization of a high-affinity NOTA-conjugated bombesin antagonist for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-para-aminobenzoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Preclinical Characterization of a Stabilized Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist for Targeted Cancer Theranostics.', 'The effects of novel macrocyclic chelates on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled Gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist RM2.', 'Reducing the Kidney Uptake of High Contrast CXCR4 PET Imaging Agents via Linker Modifications.', 'PET and SPECT Imaging of the EGFR Family (RTK Class I) in Oncology.', '66Ga-PET-imaging of GRPR-expression in prostate cancer: production and characterization of 66GaGa-NOTA-PEG2-RM26.']"""

Previous targeting of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2, two related enzymes abundantly expressed in prostatic malignancies, with radioimmunoconjugates intended for diagnostic purposes, have proven successful in rodent prostate cancer (PCa) models. In this study, we investigated the uptake and therapeutic efficacy of (177)Lu-m11B6, a human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2)-targeting radioimmunoconjugate in a pre-clinical setting.  Methods:   The murine 11B6 antibody, m11B6, with high affinity for hK2, was labeled with (177)Lu. Therapy planning was done from a biokinetic study in LNCaP xenografts, and therapeutic activities of (177)Lu-m11B6 were administered to groups of mice. Body weight and general conditions of the mice were followed over a period of 120 days.  Results:   The tumor uptake in LNCaP xenografts was 30 ± 8.2 % injected activity per gram 1 week post-injection. In vivo targeting was hK2-specific as verified by a 2.5-fold decrease in tumor uptake in pre-dosed xenografts or by a fourfold lower tumor accumulation in hK2-negative DU 145 xenografts. Therapy showed a dose-dependent efficacy in LNCaP xenografts treated with (177)Lu-m11B6. No therapeutic effect was seen in the control groups. The median survival for the lowest given activity of (177)Lu-m11B6 was 88 days compared to that of 38 days in mice given labeled non-specific IgG. For the higher administrated activities, total tumor regression was seen with minimal normal organ toxicity.  Conclusions:   We have proven the possibility of radioimmunotherapy targeting hK2 in subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts. (177)Lu-m11B6 exhibited high therapeutic efficacy, with low observed toxicity.

CYP1B1 expression has been reported to be higher in tumors compared to normal tissues, especially in hormone-related cancers including breast, ovary, and prostate tumors. To explore the role of CYP1B1 in cancer progression, we investigated the action of CYP1B1 in cells with increased CYP1B1 via the inducer 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) or an overexpression vector, in addition to decreased CYP1B1 via the inhibitor tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) or siRNA knockdown. We observed that CYP1B1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. To understand its molecular mechanism, we measured key oncogenic proteins including β-catenin, c-Myc, ZEB2, and matrix metalloproteinases following CYP1B1 modulation. CYP1B1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling via upregulation of CTNNB1, ZEB2, SNAI1, and TWIST1. Sp1, a transcription factor involved in cell growth and metastasis, was positively regulated by CYP1B1, and suppression of Sp1 expression by siRNA or DNA binding activity using mithramycin A blocked oncogenic transformation by CYP1B1. Therefore, we suggest that Sp1 acts as a key mediator for CYP1B1 action. Treatment with 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2), a major metabolite generated by CYP1B1, showed similar effects as CYP1B1 overexpression, indicating that CYP1B1 activity mediated various oncogenic events in cells. In conclusion, our data suggests that CYP1B1 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by inducing EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling via Sp1 induction.""","""['Yeo-Jung Kwon', 'Hyoung-Seok Baek', 'Dong-Jin Ye', 'Sangyun Shin', 'Donghak Kim', 'Young-Jin Chun']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['7,12-Dimethylbenzαanthracene increases cell proliferation and invasion through induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and EMT process.', 'Cytochrome P450 1B1 promotes cancer cell survival via specificity protein 1 (Sp1)-mediated suppression of death receptor 4.', 'Long-term exposure of 4-hydroxyestradiol induces the cancer cell characteristics via upregulating CYP1B1 in MCF-10A cells.', 'Naturally occurring compounds acting as potent anti-metastatic agents and their suppressing effects on Hedgehog and WNT/β-catenin signalling pathways.', 'Sox2: A Regulatory Factor in Tumorigenesis and Metastasis.', 'A New Strategy for the Old Challenge of Thalidomide: Systems Biology Prioritization of Potential Immunomodulatory Drug (IMiD)-Targeted Transcription Factors.', 'Specificity Proteins (Sp) and Cancer.', 'CYP1B1: A Novel Molecular Biomarker Predicts Molecular Subtype, Tumor Microenvironment, and Immune Response in 33 Cancers.', 'Twist1 as a target for prevention of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Induction of synergistic apoptosis by tetramethoxystilbene and nutlin-3a in human cervical cancer cells.']"""

We characterized hydroxymethylation and methylation marks by performing whole-genome next-generation sequencing in representative normal and prostate cancer-derived cell lines in order to determine functional pathways and key genes regulated by these epigenomic modifications in cancer.  Results:   Our cell line model shows disruption of hydroxymethylation distribution in cancer, with global loss and highly specific gain in promoter and CpG island regions. Significantly, we observed locus-specific retention of hydroxymethylation marks in specific intronic and intergenic regions which may play a novel role in the regulation of gene expression in critical functional pathways, such as BARD1 signaling and steroid hormone receptor signaling in cancer. We confirm a modest correlation of hydroxymethylation with expression in intragenic regions in prostate cancer, while identifying an original role for intergenic hydroxymethylation in differentially expressed regulatory pathways in cancer. We also demonstrate a successful strategy for the identification and validation of key candidate genes from differentially regulated biological pathways in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate a distinct function for aberrant hydroxymethylation within each genomic feature in cancer, suggesting a specific and complex role for the deregulation of hydroxymethylation in tumorigenesis, similar to methylation.

In this study, we investigated the effects of knocking down the PSCA on the cell migration, the invasiveness, and the EMT of the PCa cell line DU145 in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Four target sequences of the small hairpin RNA for PSCA were designed, and the best effect knockdown sequence shRNA#1 was screened to construct the stable transfected DU145 cell line (DU145 shRNA#1), the scramble sequence was also designed to construct the stable transfected DU145 cell line(DU145 scramble). Cell migration and invasion were studied using Transwell assay. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot (WB) were used to quantify PSCA, E-cadherin, β-catenin, Vimentin, Fibronectin expression in DU145, DU145 scramble, DU145 shRNA#1 in vitro and in vivo. RT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining were used to quantify PSCA, E-cadherin, and Vimentin expression in vitro. EMT-related genes Snail, Slug, and Twist, were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR in vitro.  Results:   The constructed stable knockdown of the PSCA in the DU145 cell had a silencing effect up to 90.5 %. DU145 shRNA#1 became scattered from the tightly packed colonies. It was associated with decreased cell migration and invasion. There was also an increased Vimentin and Fibronectin expression, an inhibited E-cadherin and β-catenin expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels when compared to the DU145 and the DU145 scramble in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, with the exception of the Snail, the expression of EMT-related Slug and Twist genes were upregulated.

Materials and methods:   A commercially available Agilent DNA 1000 kit was used as a final step in the CTC detection (AdnaTest) for the determination of the presence of PCR fragments generated by Multiplex PCR. Data from 30 prostate cancer patients obtained during two years of research were analyzed to determine the trueness and precision of the PCR fragment size determination. Additional experiments were performed to demonstrate the precision (repeatability, reproducibility) and robustness of PCR fragment concentration determination.  Results:   The trueness and precision of the size determination was below 3% and 2% respectively. The repeatability of the concentration determination was below 15%. The difference in concentration determination increases when Multiplex-PCR/storage step is added between the two measurements of one sample.

Four patterns of STUMP have been described including stroma with (1) degenerative atypia, (2) hypercellular spindle cells, (3) myxoid spindle cells, and (4) phyllodes-like pattern. The current study identified a novel round cell pattern. We searched our database from 1999 to 2015 and identified 7 patients with round cell pattern out of a total number of 98 patients with STUMP. All 7 cases showed mildly increased stromal cellularity with rounded nuclei, diagnosed on core biopsies in 5 cases, transurethral resection in 1 case, and radical prostatectomy in 1 case. Some degree of glandular displacement was observed in 4 cases. In 2 of the cases, STUMP was not recognized histologically by the referring pathologists and was initially diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia. As has been described with other patterns of STUMP, several cases showed associated epithelial proliferations that in some instances masked the neoplastic stromal process. The round cell pattern of STUMP is a new deceptively subtle pattern that may not be recognized as a neoplasm and may be misdiagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although there was no direct evidence in our study that the round cell pattern of STUMP has the same behavior as other variants of STUMPs, increased recognition of this entity will hopefully lead to additional studies to further understand its malignant potential.""","""['Evita T Sadimin', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Epithelial proliferations in prostatic stromal tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP).', 'Specialized stromal tumors of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 50 cases.', 'Incidental prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP): histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.', 'Sarcomas and related proliferative lesions of specialized prostatic stroma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.', 'Two cases of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) on pathological diagnosis after surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'A Rare Case of Prostatic Stromal Tumour of Uncertain Malignant Potential Surrounding Ejaculatory Ducts in a Patient With Concurrent Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'A case of incidental STUMP discovery in a patient with concurrent prostatic adenocarcinoma.']"""

MAGI-2 gene rearrangements have recently been described in prostate cancer. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of MAGI-2 protein in prostate tissue. Seventy-eight radical prostatectomies were used to construct 3 tissue microarrays consisting of 512 cores, including benign tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and adenocarcinoma, Gleason patterns 3 to 5. Immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and double-stain MAGI-2/p63 was performed and analyzed by visual and image analysis, the latter as percent of analyzed area (%AREA), and mean optical density multiplied by %AREA (STAIN). By visual and image analysis, MAGI-2 was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma and HGPIN compared with benign (benign versus HGPIN P < .001; benign versus adenocarcinoma, P < .001). HGPIN and adenocarcinoma did not significantly differ by either modality. Using visual intensity to distinguish benign tissue and adenocarcinoma, a receiver operating curve yielded an area under the curve of 0.902. A STAIN threshold of 1470 yielded a sensitivity of 0.66 and specificity of 0.96. There was a significant correlation between PTEN and MAGI-2 staining for normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia, but this was lost in HGPIN and cancer. We conclude that MAGI-2 immunoreactivity is elevated in prostate cancer and HGPIN compared with normal tissue, and suggest that MAGI-2 may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.

Materials and methods:   A total of 6,982 percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen measurements were obtained from participants in a greater than 12-year Texas screening study comprising 1,625 men who never underwent biopsy, 497 who underwent 1 or more biopsies negative for prostate cancer and 61 diagnosed with prostate cancer. We evaluated the ROC AUC of percent free prostate specific antigen and the proportion of patients with fluctuating values across multiple visits determined according to 2 thresholds (less than 15% vs 25%). The proportion of cancer cases in which percent free prostate specific antigen indicated a positive test before prostate specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml did and the number of negative biopsies that would have been spared by negative percent free prostate specific antigen test results were calculated.  Results:   Percent free prostate specific antigen fluctuated around its threshold of less than 25% (less than 15%) in 38.3% (78.1%), 42.2% (20.9%), and 11.4% (25.7%) of patients never biopsied, and with negative and positive biopsies, respectively. At the same thresholds, percent free prostate specific antigen tested positive earlier than prostate specific antigen in 71.4% and 34.2% of cancer cases, respectively. Among men with multiple negative biopsies and PSA greater than 4 ng/ml, percent free PSA would have tested negative in 31.6% and 65.8%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Percent free prostate specific antigen should accompany prostate specific antigen testing to potentially spare unnecessary biopsies or detect cancer earlier.

Importantly, this disease is mostly diagnosed at early stages offering a unique chemoprevention opportunity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and target signaling molecules with higher expression/activity in prostate tumors and play critical role in PCa growth and progression. Here we report that NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression is directly associated with PCa progression in TRAMP mice, suggesting NOX as a potential chemoprevention target in controlling PCa. Accordingly, we assessed whether NOX activity in PCa cells could be inhibited by Graviola pulp extract (GPE) that contains unique acetogenins with strong anti-cancer effects. GPE (1-5 μg/ml) treatment strongly inhibited the hypoxia-induced NOX activity in PCa cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC3) associated with a decrease in the expression of NOX catalytic and regulatory sub-units (NOX1, NOX2 and p47(phox)). Furthermore, GPE-mediated NOX inhibition was associated with a strong decrease in nuclear HIF-1α levels as well as reduction in the proliferative and clonogenic potential of PCa cells. More importantly, GPE treatment neither inhibited NOX activity nor showed any cytotoxicity against non-neoplastic prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells. Overall, these results suggest that GPE could be useful in the prevention of PCa progression via inhibiting NOX activity.""","""['Gagan Deep', 'Rahul Kumar', 'Anil K Jain', 'Deepanshi Dhar', 'Gati K Panigrahi', 'Anowar Hussain', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Tamam El-Elimat', 'Vincent P Sica', 'Nicholas H Oberlies', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Silibinin inhibits hypoxia-induced HIF-1α-mediated signaling, angiogenesis and lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells: In vitro evidence and in vivo functional imaging and metabolomics.', 'In Vitro Anticancer Properties of Table Grape Powder Extract (GPE) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cisplatin induces production of reactive oxygen species via NADPH oxidase activation in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Unchanged NADPH Oxidase Activity in Nox1-Nox2-Nox4 Triple Knockout Mice: What Do NADPH-Stimulated Chemiluminescence Assays Really Detect?', 'Role of zinc in the pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer: critical issues to resolve.', 'A Proposed Association between Improving Energy Metabolism of HepG2 Cells by Plant Extracts and Increasing Their Sensitivity to Doxorubicin.', 'The role of hypoxia on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Natural biomolecules and derivatives as anticancer immunomodulatory agents.', 'A Review on Annona muricata and Its Anticancer Activity.', 'The graviola impact on human astroglioma cells: functional significance of MUDENG.']"""

Introduction and objective:   TPSB is increasingly utilised in the diagnosis and characterisation of prostate cancer. However, there is little data on patient experience after undergoing this procedure. We circulated a questionnaire to 511 consecutive patients from July 2007 to December 2014 and now analyse the responses.  Materials and methods:   The mean age for the cohort was 64 (range 43-82). A mean of 28 biopsy cores (range 13-43) were taken under general anaesthesia (GA), as day case procedure. Patients received diclofenac 100 mg suppository on completion of the procedure. The questionnaire explored symptoms at 1 h, 1, 3 and 7 days postoperatively.  Results:   There were 301 responses (59%). Following TPSB, 38% initially experienced rectal bleeding, falling significantly to 3% on day 7 (p < 0.001) and it was not a serious condition in all cases. A majority reported haematuria at 1 h but persisting at 1 week in over one quarter (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, although initially often dark, none had other than pale pink by the end of the reporting period. In contrast, the incidence of haematospermia increased over 7 days, rising significantly to 38% by this stage (p < 0.001). Several patients commented that the procedure was more tolerable than their previous conventional TRUS biopsy and 20 (6.6%) with voiding difficulty required catheterisation. In all, 23% patients felt pain, and out of these 23% only 5% required minor analgesia at day 7.  Conclusion:   TPSB under GA without prophylactic catheterisation is well tolerated, carrying acceptable postoperative symptom rates. Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients ejaculate within 7 days, which again suggests good tolerance to the procedure. Patients should be provided with this data preoperatively when they are considering TPSB.""","""['Debashis Sarkar', 'Kingsley Ekwueme', 'Nigel Parr']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Outcomes of transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy in 409 patients.', 'Transperineal prostate biopsies for diagnosis of prostate cancer are well tolerated: a prospective study using patient-reported outcome measures.', 'Transperineal Prostate Biopsies Using Local Anesthesia: Experience with 1,287 Patients.

Results:   Low-risk PCA included 170 cases (38.8%) and tumor upgrading was detected in 111 patients (65.3%) of whom 72 (42.4%) had pathological Gleason patterns (pGP) = 3 + 4 and 39 (22.9%) pGP >3 + 4. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and proportion of positive cores (P+) were independent predictors of tumor upgrading to higher patterns. The main difference between upgraded cancers related to PSA and to P+ >0.20. The population was stratified into risk classes by PSA ≤5 μg/l and P+ ≤0.20 (class A), PSA >5 μg/l and P+ ≤0.20 (class B), PSA ≤5 μg/l and P+ >0.20 (class C) and PSA >5 μg/l and P+ 0.20 (class D).

Subjects and methods:   A nationwide prospective cohort of 90,957 radiologic technologists, who responded to a 1994-1998 survey that collected information on whether they had ever worked with fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures, was followed through completion of a subsequent cohort survey during 2003-2005 (for cancer incidence) or December 31, 2008 (for cancer mortality). Sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of Cox proportional hazards models for incidence and mortality from all cancers other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and for specific cancer outcomes in participants who reported ever performing fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures compared with technologists who never performed these procedures.  Results:   The analysis showed an approximately twofold increased risk of brain cancer mortality (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.48-4.40) and modest elevations in incidence of melanoma (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61) and in breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32) but not mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.69-1.66) among technologists who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures compared with those who never performed these procedures. Although there was a small suggestive increase in incidence of all cancers combined, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17), mortality from all cancers combined, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, was not elevated (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88-1.14). We similarly observed no elevated risk of cancers of the thyroid, skin other than melanoma, prostate, lung, or colon and rectum or of leukemia that was not chronic lymphocytic leukemia among workers who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures.  Conclusion:   We observed elevated risks of brain cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma among technologists who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures. Although exposure to low-dose radiation is one possible explanation for these increased risks, these results may also be due to chance or unmeasured confounding by nonradiation risk factors.

However, small MCAs (fewer than 100 cells per aggregate) have remained challenging to manufacture in large quantities at high uniformity. Forced aggregation into microwells offers a promising solution for forming consistent aggregates, but commercial sources of microwells are expensive, complicated to manufacture, or lack the surface packing densities that would significantly improve MCA production. To address these concerns, we custom-modified a commercial laser cutter to provide complete control over laser ablation and directly generate microwells in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate. We achieved ultra rapid microwell production speeds (>50,000 microwells/hr) at high areal packing densities (1,800 microwells/cm2) and over large surface areas for cell culture (60 cm2). Variation of the PDMS substrate distance from the laser focal plane during ablation allowed for the generation of microwells with a variety of sizes, contours, and aspect ratios. Casting of high-fidelity microneedle masters in polyurethane allowed for non-ablative microwell reproduction through replica molding. MCAs of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), murine 344SQ metastatic adenocarcinoma cells, and human C4-2 prostate cancer cells were generated in our system with high uniformity within 24 hours, and computer vision software aided in the ultra-high-throughput analysis of harvested aggregates. Moreover, MCAs maintained invasive capabilities in 3D migration assays. In particular, 344SQ MCAs demonstrated epithelial lumen formation on Matrigel, and underwent EMT and invasion in the presence of TGF-β. We expect this technique to find broad utility in the generation and cultivation of cancer cell aggregates, primary cell aggregates, and embryoid bodies.""","""['Jacob L Albritton', 'Jonathon D Roybal', 'Samantha J Paulsen', 'Nick Calafat', 'Jose A Flores-Zaher', 'Mary C Farach-Carson', 'Don L Gibbons', 'Jordan S Miller']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""RSC Adv""","""['Rapid fabrication of functionalised poly(dimethylsiloxane) microwells for cell aggregate formation.', 'Simple In-House Fabrication of Microwells for Generating Uniform Hepatic Multicellular Cancer Aggregates and Discovering Novel Therapeutics.', 'Rapid prototyping of concave microwells for the formation of 3D multicellular cancer aggregates for drug screening.', 'Characterization of mouse embryoid bodies cultured on microwell chips with different well sizes.', 'Fabrication of Concave Microwells and Their Applications in Micro-Tissue Engineering: A Review.', 'Engineering approaches for cardiac organoid formation and their characterization.', 'Recent Advances in Multicellular Tumor Spheroid Generation for Drug Screening.', 'Contextual cues from cancer cells govern cancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity.', 'A collagen glucosyltransferase drives lung adenocarcinoma progression in mice.', 'A Highly Reproducible Micro U-Well Array Plate Facilitating High-Throughput Tumor Spheroid Culture and Drug Assessment.']"""

Our previous data indicated that downregulation of the tumor suppressor microRNA-30c (miR-30c) was a frequent pathogenetic event in prostate cancer (PCa). However, a functional link between miR-30c and BCL9/Wnt signaling, and their clinical and pathological significance in PCa, have not been well established. The present study demonstrated that miR-30c serves as a key negative regulator targeting BCL9 transcription in PCa cells. Ectopic expression of miR-30c was associated with reduced expression of Wnt pathway downstream targets, including c-Myc, cluster of differentiation 44 and sex determining region Y-box 9 in DU145 human PCa cells. Examination of clinical prostate specimens revealed higher levels of BCL9 expression in PCa compared with that in benign prostate tissues. After substantiating this finding by patient sample analysis, BCL9 expression or activity was observed to be closely correlated with PCa biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease progression, whereas it was inversely associated with miR-30c. Furthermore, overexpression of BCL9 in PCa acted cooperatively with miR-30c low expression to predict earlier BCR in PCa. These findings indicate that inhibition of BCL9/Wnt signaling by miR-30c is important in the progression of PCa. Furthermore, the combined analysis of miR-30c and BCL9 may be valuable tool for prediction of BCR in PCa patients following radical prostatectomy.""","""['Xiao-Hui Ling', 'Zhi-Yun Chen', 'Hong-Wei Luo', 'Ze-Zhen Liu', 'Ying-Ke Liang', 'Guan-Xing Chen', 'Fu-Neng Jiang', 'Wei-DE Zhong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Endometrial epithelial cells-derived exosomes deliver microRNA-30c to block the BCL9/Wnt/CD44 signaling and inhibit cell invasion and migration in ovarian endometriosis.', 'MiR-30c exerts tumor suppressive functions in colorectal carcinoma by directly targeting BCL9.', 'MicroRNA-30c serves as an independent biochemical recurrence predictor and potential tumor suppressor for prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-30c-2* expressed in ovarian cancer cells suppresses growth factor-induced cellular proliferation and downregulates the oncogene BCL9.', 'Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling and Prostate Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Driver gene detection through Bayesian network integration of mutation and expression profiles.', 'Endometrial epithelial cells-derived exosomes deliver microRNA-30c to block the BCL9/Wnt/CD44 signaling and inhibit cell invasion and migration in ovarian endometriosis.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Turing miRNA into infinite coordination supermolecule: a general and enabling nanoengineering strategy for resurrecting nuclear acid therapeutics.', 'Type I collagen promotes tumor progression of integrin β1 positive gastric cancer through a BCL9L/β-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

As part of the innate immune response, these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNA or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. The 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. Three distinct forms of OAS exist in human cells (OAS1, 2 and 3) with each form having multiple spliced variants. The OAS enzymes and their spliced variants have different enzyme activities. OAS enzymes also play a significant role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter OAS activity are also associated with viral infection, diabetes and cancer. Thus detection of OAS enzyme activity with a simple spectrophotometric method in cells will be important in clinical research.  Results:   Here we propose a modified coupled spectrophotometric assay to detect 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme activity in prostate cell lines as a model system. The OAS enzyme from prostate cancer cell lysates was purified using Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) bound activated sepharose beads. The activated OAS enzyme eluted from Sepharose beads showed expression of p46 isoform of OAS1, generally considered the most abundant OAS isoform in elutes from DU14 cell line but not in other prostate cell line. In this assay the phosphates generated by the OAS enzymatic reaction is coupled with conversion of the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase (phosphorylase) using a commercially available pyrophosphate kit. The absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm. The higher levels of phosphates detected in DU145 cell line indicates more activity of OAS in this prostate cancer cell line.  Conclusion:   The modified simple method detected OAS enzyme activity with sensitivity and specificity, which could help in detection of OAS enzymes avoiding the laborious and radioactive methods.""","""['Sushma M Bhosle', 'Aisha Hunt', 'Jaideep Chaudhary']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biol Proced Online""","""[""Selection and cloning of poly(rC)-binding protein 2 and Raf kinase inhibitor protein RNA activators of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase from prostate cancer cells."", 'Length dependent activation of OAS proteins by dsRNA.', ""Impact of double-stranded RNA characteristics on the activation of human 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2)."", ""RNA regulation of the antiviral protein 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase."", ""The human 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase family: interferon-induced proteins with unique enzymatic properties."", 'Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis the Function of RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and Their Prognostic Value in Breast Cancer.']"""

Cabazitaxel demonstrated survival benefit in docetaxel-pretreated and docetaxel-refractory patients. In this study, we investigated whether the superior antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in mCRPC is explained by higher intratumoral cabazitaxel levels. Since recent studies suggest a reduced efficacy of docetaxel following treatment with novel androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agents, we also investigated taxane efficacy in an enzalutamide-resistant tumor model.  Methods:   Intratumoral concentrations of docetaxel and cabazitaxel were correlated with antitumor activity in docetaxel-naïve, docetaxel-resistant, and enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of prostate cancer.  Results:   Intratumoral drug levels were negatively related to intrinsic and acquired resistance to docetaxel. Also, the observed stronger antitumor activity of cabazitaxel was associated with increased cumulative exposure and higher intratumoral of cabazitaxel concentrations in all PDXs.  Conclusions:   The superior antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in docetaxel- and enzalutamide-resistant tumors can be partly attributed to higher intratumoral drug concentrations. Especially for patients who are intrinsically resistant to docetaxel resulting from suboptimal intratumoral docetaxel concentrations, cabazitaxel may be the preferred chemotherapeutic agent.

Results:   The anterior and posterior prostate cancer groups and the group with cancer at both locations represented 31.0%, 46.7% and 22.3% of the total number of patients, respectively. Anterior prostate cancer was less commonly palpable (p <0.001) and needed more frequent repeat biopsy (p = 0.012) than posterior prostate cancer. Moreover, the anterior group had fewer positive cores than the posterior group (p <0.001) despite comparable tumor volumes. Gleason score upgrading was more frequently observed in anterior than in posterior prostate cancer (p = 0.003). However, final pathological features did not significantly differ. Only the seminal vesicle involvement rate was lower in anterior than in posterior prostate cancer (p <0.001). Estimated 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with anterior prostate cancer was 87.5%, significantly higher than in patients with posterior prostate cancer (77.4%, p = 0.001) and patients with anterior plus posterior involvement (74.4%, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that anterior location was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (HR 0.403) along with other well-known prognostic factors.

Specifically, the accuracy of MP-MRI in detecting extracapsular extension (ECE) and individuating the side of the index lesion have been explored.  Methods:   Thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy have been retrospectively analyzed. The MRI exam incorporated T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhancement in all patients. χ(2) test was performed to assess an association between an MP-MRI suggestive of ECE and pathologic ECE; similar tests were performed to study the association between the MRI-detected side of the index lesion and its true localization on final pathology. Univariate logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate possible predictors of ECE, including MP-MRI suspected ECE.  Results:   Seventeen percent (6/35) of men presented ECE on final pathology. MP-MRI was predictive of pathologic ECE with a negative predictive value and specificity of 93% and 90%, respectively. Global accuracy of MP-MRI in predicting ECE was 86%. MRI-detected ECE was significantly predictive of pathologic ECE on logistic regression (OR: 17.3, 95% CI: 2.2-138.2, P=0.007). Moreover, MRI significantly predicted the side of the index lesion (P=0.012).

ScFvD2B, a high affinity anti-PSMA antibody fragment, was labeled using a near-infrared fluorophore to generate a specific imaging probe (X770-scFvD2B). PSMA-unrelated scFv-X770 was used as a control. Probes were injected intravenously into mice with prostate tumors and fluorescence was monitored in vivo by fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT). In vitro assays showed that X770-scFvD2B specifically bound to PSMA and was internalized in PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells. After intravenous injection, X770-scFvD2B was detected in vivo by FMT in the prostate region. On excised prostates the scFv probe co-localized with the cancer cells and was found in PSMA-expressing cells. The PSMA-unrelated scFv used as a control did not label the prostate cancer cells. Our data demonstrate that scFvD2B is a high affinity contrast agent for in vivo detection of PSMA-expressing cells in the prostate.

Physiological action of leptin in modulating the metabolic adaptation of different peripheral tissues supports the hypothesis that it could also exert a direct effect on cancer cells. In vitro, treatment with leptin up-regulated HIF-1α and stimulated adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells cultured in hypoxia. Leptin action was effective in both low and high glycolytic cancer cell lines, and determined the up-regulation of lactate exporter MCT4 and its associated protein CD147. HIF-1α stabilization was oligomycin-independent and was associated with an important modulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. In fact, leptin treatment produced mitochondrial biogenesis, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased uncoupled respiration through the up-regulation of UCP2. Furthermore, leptin counteracted the downmodulation of SIRT1 induced by hypoxia, and persistent high levels of SIRT1 were directly involved in HIF-1α stabilization. Leptin can sustain cancer progression in hypoxic environment and when mitochondrial respiration is impaired.

Here, fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) derived from hyaluronic acid (HA) are investigated. HA is a ligand for the receptor CD44, which is a common biomarker present on many primary tumor cells, cancer-initiating cells, and tumor-associated fibroblasts. In addition, a family of enzymes that degrade HA, called hyaluronidases (HYALs), are also overexpressed with increased activity in many tumors. We report the design and development of a panel of targeted imaging agents using the near-infrared (NIR) dye, Cy7.5, that was directly conjugated to hydrophobically-modified HA. Two different molecular weights of HA, 10kDa and 100kDa, and three different degrees of hydrophobic moiety conjugation (0, 10, and 30mol%) were utilized to develop a panel of NPs with variable size that ranged from 50 to 400nm hydrodynamic diameter (HD) depending HA molecular weight, extent of fluorescence quenching (25-50%), kinetics of cellular uptake, and targeting to CD44+ cells. The kinetics and energy-dependence of cellular uptake in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, MDA-MB 231 and PC-3 cells, respectively, showed increased uptake with longer incubation times (at 4 and 8h compared to 1h), as well as uptake at 37°C but not 4°C, which indicated energy-dependent endocytosis. NP uptake studies in the presence of excess free HA showed that pre-treatment of cells with excess high molecular weight (MW) free HA decreased NP uptake by up to 50%, while no such trend was observed with low MW HA. These data lay the foundation for selection of optimized HA-derived NPs for image-guided surgery.  Statement of significance:   Here, hyaluronic acid (HA), a well-studied biomacromolecule, is modified with a near infrared fluorophore and a hydrophobic moiety. The significance of this work, especially for imaging applications, is that the impact of HA molecular weight and the hydrophobic moiety conjugation degree on fluorescence and cell interaction can be predicted. With respect to existing literature, the eventual use of these HA-based NPs is image-guided surgery; thus, we focus on the dye, Cy7.5, for conjugation, which is more NIR than most existing HA literature. Furthermore, HA is a ligand for CD44, which is associated with cancer and tumor microenvironment cells. Systematic studies in this work highlight that HA can be tuned to maximize or minimize CD44 binding.""","""['Sneha S Kelkar', 'Tanner K Hill', 'Frank C Marini', 'Aaron M Mohs']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Hyaluronic acid formulation of near infrared fluorophores optimizes surgical imaging in a prostate tumor xenograft.', 'GE11 peptide modified and reduction-responsive hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles induced higher efficacy of doxorubicin for breast carcinoma therapy.', 'Tumor-targeted and multi-stimuli responsive drug delivery system for near-infrared light induced chemo-phototherapy and photoacoustic tomography.', 'Hyaluronan-modified nanoparticles for tumor-targeting.', 'Modified hyaluronic acid based materials for biomedical applications.', 'Hyaluronic Acid within Self-Assembling Nanoparticles: Endless Possibilities for Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'Water-Soluble Blue Fluorescent Nonconjugated Polymer Dots from Hyaluronic Acid and Hydrophobic Amino Acids.', 'Binding of Targeted Semiconducting Photothermal Polymer Nanoparticles for Intraperitoneal Detection and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Tuned near infrared fluorescent hyaluronic acid conjugates for delivery to pancreatic cancer for intraoperative imaging.', 'Image-guided tumor surgery: The emerging role of nanotechnology.']"""

Although landmark randomized trials and updated guidelines have challenged routine PSA screening, it is unclear whether these publications have affected rates of biopsy or postbiopsy complications.  Objective:   To evaluate whether publication of the 2008 and 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations, the 2009 European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, or the 2013 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines was associated with changes in rates of biopsy or postbiopsy complications, and to identify predictors of postbiopsy complications.  Design, setting, and participants:   This quasiexperimental study used administrative claims of 5279315 commercially insured US men aged ≥40 yr from 2005 to 2014, of whom 104584 underwent biopsy.  Interventions:   Publications on PSA screening.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Interrupted time-series analysis was used to evaluate the association of publications with rates of biopsy and 30-d complications. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of complications.  Results and limitations:   From 2005 to 2014, biopsy rates fell 33% from 64.1 to 42.8 per 100000 person-months, with immediate reductions following the 2008 USPSTF recommendations (-10.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.1 to -3.0; p<0.001), 2012 USPSTF recommendations (-13.8; 95% CI, -21.0 to -6.7; p<0 .001), and 2013 AUA guidelines (-8.8; 95% CI, -16.7 to -0.92; p=0.03). Concurrently, complication rates decreased 10% from 8.7 to 7.8 per 100000 person-months, with a reduction following the 2012 USPSTF recommendations (-2.5; 95% CI, -4.5 to -0.45; p=0.02). However, the proportion of men undergoing biopsy who experienced complications increased from 14% to 18%, driven by nonsepsis infectious complications (p<0.001). Predictors of complications included prior fluoroquinolone use (odds ratio [OR]: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.22-1.32; p<0.001), anticoagulant use (OR: 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25; p=0.004), and age ≥70 yr (OR: 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15-1.36; p<0.001). Limitations included the retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Although there has been an absolute reduction in rates of biopsy and 30-d complications, the relative morbidity of biopsy continues to increase. These observations suggest a need to reduce the morbidity of biopsy.

Objective:   To describe the Ginsburg protocol for transperineal prostate biopsy supported by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image fusion, provide learning points for its application, and report biopsy results. The article is supplemented by a Surgery in Motion video.  Design, setting, and participants:   This single-centre retrospective outcome study included 534 patients from March 2012 to October 2015. A total of 107 had no previous prostate biopsy, 295 had benign TRUS-guided biopsies, and 159 were on active surveillance for low-risk cancer.  Surgical procedure:   A Likert scale reported mpMRI for suspicion of cancer from 1 (no suspicion) to 5 (cancer highly likely). Transperineal biopsies were obtained under general anaesthesia using BiopSee fusion software (Medcom, Darmstadt, Germany). All patients had systematic biopsies, two cores from each of 12 anatomic sectors. Likert 3-5 lesions were targeted with a further two cores per lesion.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Any cancer and Gleason score 7-10 cancer on biopsy were noted. Descriptive statistics and positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated.  Results and limitations:   The detection rate of Gleason score 7-10 cancer was similar across clinical groups. Likert scale 3-5 MRI lesions were reported in 378 (71%) of the patients. Cancer was detected in 249 (66%) and Gleason score 7-10 cancer was noted in 157 (42%) of these patients. PPV for detecting 7-10 cancer was 0.15 for Likert score 3, 0.43 for score 4, and 0.63 for score 5. NPV of Likert 1-2 findings was 0.87 for Gleason score 7-10 and 0.97 for Gleason score ≥4+3=7 cancer. Limitations include lack of data on complications.  Conclusions:   Transperineal prostate biopsy supported by MRI/TRUS image fusion using the Ginsburg protocol yielded high detection rates of Gleason score 7-10 cancer. Because the NPV for excluding Gleason score 7-10 cancer was very high, prostate biopsies may not be needed for all men with elevated prostate-specific antigen values and nonsuspicious mpMRI.

This study prospectively included 170 Japanese patients with localized prostate cancer (PC) undergoing RARP without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. The erectile function of each patient was assessed based on the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and EHS at the baseline and on every visit to an outpatient clinic after RARP. In this series, potency was defined as the ability to have an erection sufficient for intercourse, corresponding to EHS ≥3, while patients with EHS ≥2 were regarded as those with erectile function. Of these 170 patients, 20 and 75 underwent bilateral and unilateral nerve-sparing procedures, respectively; however, non-nerve-sparing procedures were performed in the remaining 75. A proportional increase in the IIEF-5 score according to EHS was noted at 24 months after RARP. At 6, 12 and 24 months after RARP, the recovery rates of erectile function were 11.9, 21.7 and 35.8 %, respectively, while those of potency were 3.8, 9.8 and 13.7 %, respectively. Of several factors examined, the age, preoperative IIEF-5 score and nerve-sparing procedure were identified as independent predictors of erectile function recovery. These findings suggest that favorable erectile function recovery could not be achieved in Japanese PC patients even after the introduction of RARP; therefore, it might be preferable for such a cohort to use EHS rather than IIEF-5 as an assessment tool for the postoperative recovery of erectile function.""","""['Hideaki Miyake', 'Akira Miyazaki', 'Akihisa Yao', 'Nobuyuki Hinata', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['A prediction model relating the extent of intraoperative fascia preservation to erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictive modelling of 2-year potency outcomes using a novel 90-day erection fullness scale after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile function recovery after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP): long term exhaustive analysis across all preoperative potency categories.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile function post robotic radical prostatectomy: technical tips to improve outcomes?', 'Erection hardness score or penile Doppler ultrasound: which is a better predictor of failure of nonsurgical treatment of erectile dysfunction?', 'Comparison of the efficacy of the early LI-SWT plus daily tadalafil with daily tadalafil only as penile rehabilitation for postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Width of spared neurovascular bundle after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer: is it a reliable factor for predicting postoperative sexual outcome?', 'Changes in sexual function and serum testosterone levels in patients with prostate cancer after image-guided proton therapy.', 'Validity of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sexual Interest and Satisfaction Measures in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Most spatial survival models stochastically order survival curves from different subpopulations. However, it is common for survival curves from two subpopulations to cross in epidemiological cancer studies and thus interpretable standard survival models can not be used without some modification. Common fixes are the inclusion of time-varying regression effects in the proportional hazards model or fully nonparametric modeling, either of which destroys any easy interpretability from the fitted model. To address this issue, we develop a generalized accelerated failure time model which allows stratification on continuous or categorical covariates, as well as providing per-variable tests for whether stratification is necessary via novel approximate Bayes factors. The model is interpretable in terms of how median survival changes and is able to capture crossing survival curves in the presence of spatial correlation.

We showed that phosphorylated forms of NPM1 interact with androgen receptor (AR) in nucleoplasm. N6L treatment of prostate tumor cells led to inhibition of NPM1 phosphorylation in conjunction with inhibition of AR activity. We also found that total and phosphorylated NPM1 were overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa.

Altered function of AR-interacting factors may contribute to castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa). Inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1) is a tumor suppressor that regulates various cellular processes including cell proliferation. Interestingly, ING1 expression is upregulated in senescent primary human prostate cells; however, its role in AR signaling in PCa was unknown. Using a proteomic approach by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (SELDI-MS) combined with immunological techniques, we provide here evidence that ING1b interacts in vivo with the AR. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro GST-pull-down, and quantitative intracellular colocalization analyses. Functionally, ING1b inhibits AR-responsive promoters and endogenous key AR target genes in the human PCa LNCaP cells. Conversely, ING1b knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit enhanced AR activity, suggesting that the interaction with ING1b represses the AR-mediated transcription. Also, data suggest that ING1b expression is downregulated in CRPCa cells compared with androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Interestingly, its ectopic expression induces cellular senescence and reduces cell migration in both androgen-dependent and CRPCa cells. Intriguingly, ING1b can also inhibit androgen-induced growth in LNCaP cells in a similar manner as AR antagonists. Moreover, ING1b upregulates different cell cycle inhibitors including p27(KIP1), which is a novel target for ING1b. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel corepressor function of ING1b on various AR functions, thereby inhibiting PCa cell growth.""","""['Mohsen Esmaeili', 'Susanne Jennek', 'Susann Ludwig', 'Alexandra Klitzsch', 'Florian Kraft', 'Christian Melle', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Mol Cell Biol""","""['A novel crosstalk between the tumor suppressors ING1 and ING2 regulates androgen receptor signaling.', 'A natural androgen receptor antagonist induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of MAPK-signaling pathway promotes the interaction of the corepressor SMRT with the human androgen receptor and mediates repression of prostate cancer cell growth in the presence of antiandrogens.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Golgi-apparatus genes related signature for predicting the progression-free interval of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Molecular mechanisms of inhibitor of growth (ING) family members in health and malignancy.']"""

To examine metastatic progression in the bone microenvironment, we implanted androgen-sensitive, androgen receptor-positive, and relatively slow-growing Dunning G (G) rat prostate tumor cells into the tibial bone marrow of fully immune-competent Copenhagen rats. We show that tumor establishment in the bone marrow was reduced compared with the prostate, and whereas androgen deprivation did not affect tumor establishment or growth in the bone, this was markedly reduced in the prostate. Moreover, we found that, with time, G tumor cells in the bone microenvironment progress to a more aggressive phenotype with increased growth rate, reduced androgen sensitivity, and increased metastatic capacity. Tumor cells in the bone marrow encounter lower androgen levels and a higher degree of hypoxia than at the primary site, which may cause high selective pressures and eventually contribute to the development of a new and highly aggressive tumor cell phenotype. It is therefore important to specifically study progression in bone metastases. This tumor model could be used to increase our understanding of how tumor cells adapt in the bone microenvironment and may subsequently improve therapy strategies for prostate metastases in bone.""","""['Sofia Halin Bergström', 'Stina H Rudolfsson', 'Anders Bergh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor potentiates acute effects of castration in a rat model for prostate cancer growth in bone.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Bone Cell Activity in Clinical Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis and Its Inverse Relation to Tumor Cell Androgen Receptor Activity.', 'Androgen deprivation induces selective outgrowth of aggressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer clones expressing distinct cellular and molecular properties not present in parental androgen-dependent cancer cells.', 'Bone Marrow Microenvironment as a Regulator and Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial and Stromal Characteristics of Primary Tumors Predict the Bone Metastatic Subtype of Prostate Cancer and Patient Survival after Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Rat prostate tumors induce DNA synthesis in remote organs.', 'Focused versus conventional radiotherapy in spinal oncology: is there any difference in fusion rates and pseudoarthrosis?', 'Clinical and biological relevance of the transcriptomic-based prostate cancer metastasis subtypes MetA-C.']"""

Detecting novel splice junctions in the cancer transcriptome may reveal pathways driving tumorigenic events. In this regard, RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing technology, has expanded the study of cancer transcriptomics in the areas of gene expression, chimeric events and alternative splicing in search of novel biomarkers for the disease.  Results:   In this study, we propose a new two-dimensional peak finding method for detecting differential splice junctions in prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data. We have designed an integrative process that involves a new two-dimensional peak finding algorithm to combine junctions and then remove irrelevant introns across different samples within a population. We have also designed a scoring mechanism to select the most common junctions.  Conclusions:   Our computational analysis on three independent datasets collected from patients diagnosed with prostate cancer reveals a small subset of junctions that may potentially serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer.

Data from 22,249 prostate cancer cases and 22,133 controls from 22 studies within the international PRACTICAL consortium were analyzed. Allele scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported to be uniquely associated with each of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels, were first validated in an independent dataset, and then entered into logistic regression models to estimate the presence (and direction) of any causal effect of each lipid trait on prostate cancer risk. There was weak evidence for an association between the LDL genetic score and cancer grade: the odds ratio (OR) per genetically instrumented standard deviation (SD) in LDL, comparing high- (≥7 Gleason score) versus low-grade (<7 Gleason score) cancers was 1.50 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.46; P = 0.11). A genetically instrumented SD increase in TGs was weakly associated with stage: the OR for advanced versus localized cancer per unit increase in genetic risk score was 1.68 (95% CI: 0.95, 3.00; P = 0.08). The rs12916-T variant in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) was inversely associated with prostate cancer (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.00; P = 0.03). In conclusion, circulating lipids, instrumented by our genetic risk scores, did not appear to alter prostate cancer risk. We found weak evidence that higher LDL and TG levels increase aggressive prostate cancer risk, and that a variant in HMGCR (that mimics the LDL lowering effect of statin drugs) reduces risk.

To investigate the performance of and validate the grade-grouping system, biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) rates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier tests, Cox-regression modelling, and discriminatory comparison analyses. Separate analyses were performed based on biopsy and RP grade.  Results:   The median follow-up was 52.7 months.

The aim of this study was to assess the value of delayed imaging after forced diuresis.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-six patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT for evaluation of prostate cancer at 60 min post-injection. In subgroups of patients, this was amended by delayed imaging after 180 min post-injection, preceded by furosemide and oral hydration early, at the time of tracer injection, or delayed, at 100 min post-injection. Urinary tracer activity within the bladder and focal ureteral activity was analyzed.  Results:   After forced diuresis, linear and focal visualization of ureters was significantly reduced. After delayed furosemide, mean and peak bladder activity decreased (p < 0.001), and image quality of the prostate region improved on delayed images (p < 0.001). Early furosemide co-injection with tracer resulted in increased mean and peak bladder activity (p < 0.001) and in deteriorated image quality of the prostate region on delayed images (p = 0.008).

Patients and methods:   In 25 consecutive patients, PSA (prostate specific antigen) and IOP were measured with Goldmann tonometry before and after a mean of 10 days following RPE. The data of three patients with proven glaucoma were evaluated separately. The data of 22 patients without glaucoma were analysed with non-parametric statistical methods. The primary objective of the investigation was the statistical analysis of the changes in the IOP of the right eyes. The results for the left eyes are presented as secondary objective.  Results:   The mean IOP in the right eye decreased from 13.95 ± 2.95 mmHg (n = 22) preoperatively to 12.18 ± 1.99 mmHg postoperatively; the average reduction in pressure was 1.77 ± 2.44 mmHg. In the left eyes, the IOP of 14.45 ± 3.16 mmHg preoperatively decreased to 12.05 ± 2.21 mmHg postoperatively. The average reduction in pressure was 2.41 ± 3.53 mmHg. The PSA level decreased from 18.70 ± 21.66 ng/ml preoperatively (median: 11.3 ng/ml) to 2.21 ± 3.13 ng/ml postoperatively (median: 1.25 ng/ml). The decline in IOP and the difference in PSA are highly statistically significant (Wilcoxon test for paired samples, n = 22, p < 0.01). There was no linear relationship between the reductions in IOP and PSA (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.137, p = 0.542 for right eyes, r = 0.062, p = 0.784 for left eyes).  Conclusion:   Our case series shows that there is a statistically significant decrease in IOP following RPE, and to a clinically relevant extent. The changes in PSA and IOP might be linked by changes in prostaglandin metabolism in the prostate and/or the seminal vesicles. This theory remains to be confirmed by further studies. The increase in IOP during the development of prostate cancer might also be linked to changes in prostaglandin metabolism and composition.

Design, setting, and participants:   A microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality was created. A simulated contemporary cohort of US men beginning at 40 years of age underwent 18 strategies for PSA screening. Treatment strategies included (1) contemporary treatment practices based on age and cancer stage and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) selective treatment practices whereby cases with a Gleason score lower than 7 and clinical T2a stage cancer or lower are treated only after clinical progression, and all other cases undergo contemporary treatment practices. National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence of prostate cancer, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct medical expenditure were analyzed. Data were collected from March 18, 2009, to August 15, 2014, and analyzed from November 20, 2012, to December 11, 2015.  Interventions:   Eighteen screening strategies that vary by start and stop age, screening interval, and criteria for biopsy referral and contemporary or selective treatment practices.  Main outcomes and measures:   Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), direct medical expenditure, and cost per LY and QALY gained.  Results:   All 18 screening strategies were associated with increased LYs (range, 0.03-0.06) and costs ($263-$1371) compared with no screening, with the cost ranging from $7335 to $21 649 per LY. With contemporary treatment, only strategies with biopsy referral for PSA levels higher than 10.0 ng/mL or age-dependent thresholds were associated with increased QALYs (0.002-0.004), and only quadrennial screening of patients aged 55 to 69 years was potentially cost-effective in terms of cost per QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $92 446). With selective treatment, all strategies were associated with increased QALYs (0.002-0.004), and several strategies were potentially cost-effective in terms of cost per QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $70 831-$136 332).  Conclusions and relevance:   For PSA screening to be cost-effective, it needs to be used conservatively and ideally in combination with a conservative management approach for low-risk disease.""","""['Joshua A Roth', 'Roman Gulati', 'John L Gore', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Does Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Do More Good Than Harm?: Depends on How You Do It.', 'Re: Economic Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Selective Treatment Strategies.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'Estimating the harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening as used in common practice versus recommended good practice: A microsimulation screening analysis.', 'Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen--based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.', 'Economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'The aggregate value of cancer screenings in the United States: full potential value and value considering adherence.', 'Global Burden of Prostate Cancer and Association with Socioeconomic Status, 1990-2019: A Systematic Analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study.', 'What is the cost-effectiveness of menu calorie labelling on reducing obesity-associated cancer burdens?

Previous studies using in vitro stem cell assays have suggested that the CD133-expressing prostate basal cells may serve as the putative prostate stem cells. However, the precise localization of the CD133-expressing cells and their contributions to adult murine prostate homeostasis in vivo remain undetermined. We show that loss of function of CD133 does not impair murine prostate morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, implying a dispensable role for CD133 in prostate stem cell function. Using a CD133-CreER(T2) model in conjunction with a fluorescent report line, we show that CD133 is not only expressed in a fraction of prostate basal cells, but also in some luminal cells and stromal cells. CD133(+) basal cells possess higher in vitro sphere-forming activities than CD133(-) basal cells. However, the in vivo lineage tracing study reveals that the two cell populations possess the same regenerative capacity and contribute equally to the maintenance of the basal cell lineage. Similarly, CD133(+) and CD133(-) luminal cells are functionally equivalent in maintaining the luminal cell lineage. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD133 does not enrich for the stem cell activity in vivo in adult murine prostate. This study does not contradict previous reports showing CD133(+) cells as prostate stem cells in vitro.

Methods and materials:   Forty-seven consecutive patients between May 2000 and December 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. Each patient underwent a preprocedural MRSI, and MRS-positive voxels suspicious for malignancy were identified. Intraoperative planning was used to determine the optimal seed distribution to deliver a standard prescription dose to the entire prostate, while escalating the dose to MRS-positive voxels to 150% of prescription. Each patient underwent transperineal implantation of radioactive seeds followed by same-day CT for postimplant dosimetry.  Results:   The median prostate D90 (minimum dose received by 90% of the prostate) was 125.7% (interquartile range [IQR], 110.3-136.5%) of prescription. The median value for the MRS-positive mean dose was 229.9% (IQR, 200.0-251.9%). Median urethra D30 and rectal D30 values were 142.2% (137.5-168.2%) and 56.1% (40.1-63.4%), respectively. Median followup was 86.4 months (IQR, 49.8-117.6). The 10-year actuarial prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival was 98% (95% confidence interval, 93-100%). Five patients (11%) experienced late Grade 3 urinary toxicity (e.g., urethral stricture), which improved after operative intervention. Four of these patients had dose-escalated voxels less than 1.0 cm from the urethra.

The interval of time that lapses between first diagnosis and treatment is another disparity that may exist but has not been fully explored.  Methods:   Our study looked at the data of 749 men (353 black and 396 white) who were 40 to 81 years of age when they entered the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry during the years 2007 and 2008. Our dependent variable was the amount of months that had passed between first diagnosis and treatment. Our main independent variable was self-reported race. Covariates included age, income, level of education, insurance status, treatment received, Gleason score, and level of medical mistrust. We used negative binomial regression analysis to determine the association between the amount of time that lapsed between a diagnosis of prostate cancer and treatment by race.  Results:   Compared with white men, black men were more likely to experience a longer wait time between diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.36). Controls for demographical, clinical, and psychosocial variables (IRR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43) did not explain this difference between the races.

To assist with decision making on selecting either AXB-Dm or AXB-Dw for dose reporting, a retrospective study of treated patients for head & neck (H&N), prostate, breast and lung is presented. Ten patients, previously treated using AAA plans, were selected for each site and re-planned with AXB-Dm and AXB-Dw. Re-planning was done with fixed monitor units (MU) as well as non-fixed MUs. Dose volume histograms (DVH) of targets and organs at risk (OAR), were analyzed in conjunction with ICRU-83 recommended dose reporting metrics. Additionally, comparisons of plan homogeneity indices (HI) and MUs were done to further highlight the differences between the algorithms. Results showed that, on average AAA overestimated dose to the target volume and OARs by less than 2.0 %. Comparisons between AXB-Dw and AXB-Dm, for all sites, also showed overall dose differences to be small (<1.5 %). However, in non-water biological media, dose differences between AXB-Dw and AXB-Dm, as large as 4.6 % were observed. AXB-Dw also tended to have unexpectedly high 3D maximum dose values (>135 % of prescription dose) for target volumes with high density materials. Homogeneity indices showed that AAA planning and optimization templates would need to be adjusted only for the H&N and Lung sites. MU comparison showed insignificant differences between AXB-Dw relative to AAA and between AXB-Dw relative to AXB-Dm. However AXB-Dm MUs relative to AAA, showed an average difference of about 1.3 % signifying an underdosage by AAA. In conclusion, when dose is reported as AXB-Dw, the effect that high density structures in the PTV has on the dose distribution should be carefully considered. As the results show overall small dose differences between the algorithms, when transitioning from AAA to AXB, no significant change to existing prescription protocols is expected. As most of the clinical experience is dose-to-water based and calibration protocols and clinical trials are also dose-to-water based and there still exists uncertainties in converting CT number to medium, selecting AXB-Dw is strongly recommended.""","""['Jackson M Zifodya', 'Cameron H C Challens', 'Wen-Long Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Dosimetric comparison of analytical anisotropic algorithm and the two dose reporting modes of Acuros XB dose calculation algorithm\xa0in volumetric modulated arc therapy of carcinoma lung and carcinoma prostate.', 'Difference in dose-volumetric data between the analytical anisotropic algorithm, the dose-to-medium, and the dose-to-water reporting modes of the Acuros XB for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric impact of switching from AAA to Acuros dose-to-water and dose-to-medium for RapidArc plans of nasopharyngeal carcinomas.', 'Evaluation of the effect of field sizes on radiation dose in the presence of metal materials using Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Report dose-to-medium in clinical trials where available; a consensus from the Global Harmonisation Group to maximize consistency.', 'Benchmarking Automated Machine Learning-Enhanced Planning With Ethos Against Manual and Knowledge-Based Planning for Locally Advanced Lung Cancer.', 'Dosimetric Influence of Acuros XB Dose-to-Medium and Dose-to-Water Reporting Modes on Carcinoma Cervix Using Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and Volumetric RapidArc Technique.', 'Dose calculation and reporting with a linear Boltzman transport equation solver in vertebral SABR.', 'Virtual bronchoscopy-guided lung SAbR: dosimetric implications of using AAA versus Acuros XB to calculate dose in airways.', 'Comprehensive nodal breast VMAT: solving the low-dose wash dilemma using an iterative knowledge-based radiotherapy planning solution.']"""

While there is concern that uncured PDMS oligomers may leach into culture medium and/or hydrophobic molecules may be absorbed into PDMS structures, there is no consensus on how or if PDMS influences cell behaviour. We observed that human umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived CD34(+) cells expanded in standard culture medium on PDMS exhibit reduced CD38 surface expression, relative to cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces CD38 expression, and we reasoned that this hydrophobic molecule might be absorbed by PDMS. Through a series of experiments we demonstrated that ATRA-mediated CD38 expression was attenuated when cultures were maintained on PDMS. Medium pre-incubated on PDMS for extended durations resulted in a time-dependant reduction of ATRA in the medium and increasingly attenuated CD38 expression. This indicated a time-dependent absorption of ATRA into the PDMS. To better understand how PDMS might generally influence cell behaviour, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify potential upstream regulators. This analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes in primary cells including CD34(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), and keratinocytes, and cell lines including prostate cancer epithelial cells (LNCaP), breast cancer epithelial cells (MCF-7), and myeloid leukaemia cells (KG1a). IPA predicted that the most likely common upstream regulator of perturbed pathways was ATRA. We demonstrate here that ATRA is absorbed by PDMS in a time-dependent manner and results in the concomitant reduced expression of CD38 on the cell surface of CB-derived CD34(+) cells.""","""['Kathryn Futrega', 'Jianshi Yu', 'Jace W Jones', 'Maureen A Kane', 'William B Lott', 'Kerry Atkinson', 'Michael R Doran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['Requirement of retinoids for the expression of CD38 on human hematopoietic progenitors in vitro.', 'Retinoic acid-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid receptor-alpha.', 'All-trans retinoic acid and a novel synthetic retinoid tamibarotene (Am80) differentially regulate CD38 expression in human leukemia HL-60 cells: possible involvement of protein kinase C-delta.', 'All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) enhances maintenance of primitive human hematopoietic progenitors and skews them towards myeloid differentiation in a stroma-noncontact culture system.', 'Biological implications of polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic cell culture.', 'Partitioning of Small Hydrophobic Molecules into Polydimethylsiloxane in Microfluidic Analytical Devices.', 'Human microphysiological models of airway and alveolar epithelia.', 'Simulating drug concentrations in PDMS microfluidic organ chips.', 'Organosilicon uptake by biological membranes.', 'Spheroid Coculture of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells and Monolayer Expanded Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells in Polydimethylsiloxane Microwells Modestly Improves In Vitro Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell Expansion.']"""

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3-T was performed before and after CIRT. Before and after treatment, ADC values were measured in the tumors and in the benign tissues of the prostate, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were also assessed. We divided the patients into two groups: PSA response (PSA declines ≥50 %) and non-PSA response group (PSA declines <50 %).  Results:   After CIRT treatment, the mean ADC value of the tumors (1.23 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) was significantly increased as compared with the pretreatment value (1.07 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) (p < 0.001), whereas the ADC values of the benign tissues after treatment did not significantly increase compared with the pretreatment values (p = 0.235). The mean PSA level was significantly reduced from 2.027 ng/mL before treatment to 0.822 ng/mL, respectively, after treatment (p = 0.0063).

The expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is generally associated with cytoprotection and was demonstrated to mediate chemoresistance under cytostatic therapy, for instance, docetaxel treatment. In this study, we investigated the impact of AA treatment on HSP27 expression and PC cell growth.  Materials and methods:   HSP27 expression levels in docetaxel and AA-treated PC cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were determined by SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis. Proliferation assays were performed using a CASY Cell Counter and Analyzer Model TT (Roche Applied Science).  Results:   Despite significantly increased HSP27 expression in PC cells incubated with docetaxel, Western blot analysis implicated a significant reduction of the cytoprotective HSP27 in AA-treated PC cells. Notably, HSP27 stably overexpressed in PC-3-HSP27 cells did not appear as an HSP27-mediated proliferation benefit in the presence of AA as shown in docetaxel incubation studies.  Conclusion:   In contrast to repeatedly demonstrated HSP27-driven chemoresistance related to chemotherapeutics, our results may constitute a broader molecular mode of action of AA chemotherapy. AA efficacy may exert an HSP27 suppressive role that goes beyond the primarily assumed inhibition of androgen biosynthesis.""","""['Martin Weiss', 'Hannes Ahrend', 'Hannah Grossebrummel', 'Patrick Ziegler', 'Lars-Ove Brandenburg', 'Reinhard Walther', 'Uwe Zimmermann', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Matthias B Stope']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Heat shock protein 27 confers resistance to androgen ablation and chemotherapy in prostate cancer cells through eIF4E.', 'Heat shock protein expression independently predicts clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Small interference RNA targeting heat-shock protein 27 inhibits the growth of prostatic cell lines and induces apoptosis via caspase-3 activation in vitro.', 'Immediate and transient phosphorylation of the heat shock protein 27 initiates chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'Abiraterone acetate (AA): current guidelines of prescription of abiraterone.', 'Dirty deeds done dirt cheap: sensitization of prostate cancer cells to abiraterone treatment using hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls.', 'Promising Tools in Prostate Cancer Research: Selective Non-Steroidal Cytochrome P450 17A1 Inhibitors.']"""

Inflammatory processes are related to the etiology of various types of tumors, and prostate inflammation, in particular, has been associated with prostate cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with benign and malignant lesions in the anogenital tract of both females and males. The possible role of HPV in prostate carcinogenesis is a subject of great controversy. In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence of HPV infections in prostate carcinomas of patients from northeastern Brazil. This study included 104 tissue samples from primary prostate carcinoma cases. HPV DNA was purified and then amplified using MY09/11 and GP5+/GP6+ degenerate primer sets that detect a wide range of HPV types, and with specific PCR primers sets for E6 and E7 HPV regions to detect HPV 16. None of the samples showed amplification products of HPV DNA for primer sets MY09/11 and GP5+/GP6+, or the specific primer set for the E6 and E7 HPV regions.

Here, we describe a platform technology to prepare antibody binding fragment (Fab)-bearing nanoparticles and an accompanying real-time cell-based assay to determine their cellular uptake compared to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and Fabs. The nanoparticle platform was composed of core-cross-linked polyion complex (PIC) micelles prepared from azide-functionalized PEG-b-poly(amino acids), that is, azido-PEG-b-poly(l-lysine) [N3-PEG-b-PLL] and azido-PEG-b-poly(aspartic acid) [N3-PEG-b-PAsp]. These PIC micelles were 30 nm in size and contained approximately 10 polymers per construct. Fabs were derived from an antibody binding the EphA2 receptor expressed on cancer cells and further engineered to contain a reactive cysteine for site-specific attachment and a cleavable His tag for purification from cell culture expression systems. Azide-functionalized micelles and thiol-containing Fab were linked using a heterobifunctional cross-linker (FPM-PEG4-DBCO) that contained a fluorophenyl-maleimide for stable conjugation to Fabs thiols and a strained alkyne (DBCO) group for coupling to micelle azide groups. Analysis of Fab-PIC micelle conjugates by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and UV-vis absorbance determined that each nanoparticle contained 2-3 Fabs. Evaluation of cellular uptake in receptor positive cancer cells by real-time fluorescence microscopy revealed that targeted Fab-PIC micelles achieved higher cell uptake than mAbs and Fabs, demonstrating the utility of this approach to identify targeted nanoparticle constructs with unique cellular internalization properties.""","""['Stelios Florinas', 'Marc Liu', 'Ryan Fleming', 'Lilian Van Vlerken-Ysla', 'Joanne Ayriss', 'Ryan Gilbreth', 'Nazzareno Dimasi', 'Changshou Gao', 'Herren Wu', 'Ze-Qi Xu', 'Shaoyi Chen', 'Anjaneyulu Dirisala', 'Kazunori Kataoka', 'Horacio Cabral', 'R James Christie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Tuned Density of Anti-Tissue Factor Antibody Fragment onto siRNA-Loaded Polyion Complex Micelles for Optimizing Targetability into Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'siRNA-Loaded Polyion Complex Micelle Decorated with Charge-Conversional Polymer Tuned to Undergo Stepwise Response to Intra-Tumoral and Intra-Endosomal pHs for Exerting Enhanced RNAi Efficacy.', 'Antibody fragment-conjugated polymeric micelles incorporating platinum drugs for targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'pH/sugar dual responsive core-cross-linked PIC micelles for enhanced intracellular protein delivery.', 'Computational studies of micellar and nanoparticle nanomedicines.', 'Ligand Installation to Polymeric Micelles for Pediatric Brain Tumor Targeting.', 'Progress in Polymeric Micelles for Drug Delivery Applications.', 'Nanoparticle Delivery in Prostate Tumors Implanted in Mice Facilitated by Either Local or Whole-Body Heating.', 'Functionalized Particles Designed for Targeted Delivery.', 'Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Antibody-Drug Conjugates Designed for Stable Thiol Conjugation.']"""

Nervous system affection caused by local tumor growth or osseous metastases are the main causes of neurological symptoms in prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer is rarely reported in association with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). We have, therefore, studied clinical and paraclinical findings of a series of patients with prostate cancer and PNS, and reviewed cases reported in the literature. Case histories of 14 patients with definite PNS from the PNS Euronetwork database and from the authors' databases were reviewed. A PubMed literature search identified 23 patients with prostate cancer and PNS. Thus, a total of 37 case histories were reviewed with respect to syndrome type, cancer evolution, paraclinical investigations, antibody status, treatment and outcome. The three most frequent isolated PNS were paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM)/limbic encephalitis and subacute sensory neuronopathy (SSN). Onconeural antibodies were detected in 23 patients, in most cases the Hu antibody (17 patients, 74 % of all antibody-positive cases). Other well-characterized onconeural antibodies (Yo, CV2/CRMP5, amphiphysin, VGCC antibodies) were found in a minority. PNS was diagnosed prior to prostate cancer diagnosis in 50 % of the cases. The association of PNS with prostate cancer is quite infrequent, but clinically important. PNS often heralds prostate cancer diagnosis. Syndromes associated with Hu antibodies predominate. Another tumor more prone to associate with PNS should always be excluded.""","""['A Storstein', 'M Raspotnig', 'R Vitaliani', 'B Giometto', 'F Graus', 'W Grisold', 'J Honnorat', 'C A Vedeler']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Neurol""","""['""Non-classical"" paraneoplastic neurological syndromes associated with well-characterized antineuronal antibodies as compared to ""classical"" syndromes - More frequent than expected.', 'A single center retrospective study of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes with positive onconeural antibodies.', 'SOX1 antibodies in sera from patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.', 'Onconeural antibodies in patients with neurological symptoms: detection and clinical significance.', 'Neuropathy associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome.', 'Antibody Diversity in Cancer: Translational Implications and Beyond.', 'Acute Onset Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy with Prostatic Malignancy.', ""Paraneoplastic Neuropathies: What's New Since the 2004 Recommended Diagnostic Criteria."", 'A 58-Year-Old Man With Episodic Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure.', 'Anti-SOX1 Antibodies in Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome.']"""

The effects of increasing hypofractionation use on departments and staff currently based on fee-for-service models are not well studied.  Methods:   We modeled the effects of moving to hypofractionation for prostate, breast, and lung cancer and palliative treatments in a typical-sized hospital-based radiation oncology department. Year 2015 relative value unit (RVU) data were used to determine changes in reimbursement. The change in number of fractions was used to model the effects on machine volume, staff time, and workforce predictions.  Results:   The per-case marginal reduction in technical revenue was $1,777, $4,297, $9,041, and $9,498 for palliative and breast, prostate, and lung cancer cases, respectively. The physician reduction per case in RVUs was 5.22, 10.44, 43.02, and 43.02 respectively. A department could anticipate an annual reduction in technical revenue of $540,661 and a reduction in workflow of approximately five patients or 1 to 1.5 hours per day from a hypofractionation rate of 40%.  Conclusion:   The move to hypofractionation in the United States will lead to increased pressures on departments to address budget shortfalls resulting from the decrease in per-patient revenue. This may be done through a combination of an increase in patient volume, recognition of the increased skill sets required to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy, delay in capital purchases, and/or reduction in staff. In a value-based environment, these evolutions should improve the value proposition of radiation oncology over a fee-for-service model.""","""['Andre Konski', 'James B Yu', 'Gary Freedman', 'Louis B Harrison', 'Peter A S Johnstone']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Ambulatory patient classifications and the regressive nature of Medicare reform: is the reduction in outpatient health care reimbursement worth the price?', 'Practice evolution of hypofractionation in breast radiation therapy and medical impact.', 'The Pattern of Use of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer in New South Wales, Australia, 2008 to 2012.', 'Comparative effectiveness research in radiation oncology: stereotactic radiosurgery, hypofractionation, and brachytherapy.', 'The come-back of hypofractionation?.', 'Adoption of Ultrahypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer.', 'Has Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Radiation Therapy Become the Standard of Care in the United States?

Objective:   To assess the effects of enzalutamide versus placebo in patients from PREVAIL based on site and extent of baseline disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   One thousand seven hundred and seventeen asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients were randomized to enzalutamide (n=872) or placebo (n=845). Subgroup analyses included nonvisceral (only bone and/or nodal; n=1513), visceral (lung and/or liver; n=204), low-volume bone disease (<4 bone metastases; n=867), high-volume bone disease (≥4 bone metastases; n=850), lymph node only disease (n=195).  Intervention:   Oral enzalutamide (160mg) or placebo once daily while continuing androgen deprivation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Coprimary endpoints (rPFS, OS) were prospectively evaluated in nonvisceral and visceral subgroups. All other efficacy analyses were post hoc.  Results and limitations:   Enzalutamide improved rPFS versus placebo in patients with nonvisceral disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.22), visceral disease (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.49), low- or high-volume bone disease (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11-0.22; HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.16-0.29, respectively), and lymph node only disease (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.19).

Among biomarkers, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) has gained attention as it regulates extracellular pH and induces cytoplasmic alkalization contributing to malignant progression and poor treatment outcome. Works on tissues suggested the potential use of CAIX as a tumor biomarker for urogenital malignancies, but only few studies have been performed on its detection in urine.  Scope:   The aim of the present study is the measurement of CAIX messenger RNA (mRNA) in urine sediments of patients affected by kidney, prostate, and bladder cancers to evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the test.  Procedures:   The quantification of the total CAIX mRNA concentration and of its full-length isoform (CAIX FL) have been performed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on RNA extracted from urine sediments of patients affected by urogenital cancers.  Results:   Urinary total CAIX mRNA expression resulted to be lower in patients with kidney and prostate cancer in comparison with the control group, but no statistically significant difference could be evidenced for bladder cancer. The evaluation of the relative percentage of FL isoform mRNA (FL%) showed a significant increase of FL% in urine from patients with cancer (median = 70.8%) in comparison with the healthy subjects (median = 2.6%) and this finding was confirmed for each cancer type separately. The comparison among receiver operating characteristic curves for total CAIX mRNA, CAIX FL mRNA, and FL% indicated that FL% shows the best diagnostic performance with 90% sensitivity and 72% specificity. Comparison of the results obtained in urine with those found in the corresponding tissues indicated 80% concordance.  Conclusions:   The CAIX mRNA expression in urine sediments can be considered a surrogate marker of CAIX expression in tumor tissues of urogenital origin.

One way to remove the residual error is to perform a couch shift in opposite direction. In principle, such couch shifts could cause secondary displacements of the patient and prostate. Hence it is interesting to investigate if couch shifts might amplify intra-fraction motion.  Findings:   Intra-fraction motion of the prostate and patient couch position were simultaneously recorded during 359 fractions in 15 patients. During this time, a total of 22 couch shifts of up to 31.5 mm along different axes were recorded. Prostate position and couch position were plotted before, during and after each couch shift. There was no visible impact of couch shifts on prostate motion. The standard deviation of prostate position was calculated before, during and after each couch shift. The standard deviation did not significantly increase during couch shifts (by 3 % on average, p = 0.88) and even slightly decreased after a couch shift (by 37 % on average; p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Shifts of the patient couch did not adversely affect the motion of the prostate relative to the patient couch.

This causes destabilization of the existing cellular transmembrane potential leading to cell death, due to the inability to maintain cellular homeostasis. This phase I-II study was designed to evaluate the histopathological outcomes of irreversible electroporation to prostate and surrounding tissue in radical prostatectomy specimens.  Materials and methods:   Sixteen patients with prostate cancer underwent an irreversible electroporation ablation without curative intent, followed by radical prostatectomy scheduled 4 weeks later. For histopathological examination of the prostate, whole mounted tissue slices were examined by dedicated genitourinary pathologists. The borders of the ablation zone and residual tumor were outlined on the slides.  Results:   The irreversible electroporation ablation zones were characterized as areas of fibrosis, necrosis and loss of epithelial tissue in terms of denudation in the glandular structures. The ablation zone was well demarcated, showing trenchant delineations between viable and nonviable tissue. The ablated tissue showed mild to moderate inflammation, with atrophic cells in 1 case. The area was surrounded by hemorrhage at the location of the electrodes. No skip lesions or viable tissue was seen in the ablation zone.

Whether or not chemotherapy can be safely administered following radium-223 treatment is of clinical importance. An exploratory analysis of prospectively collected data, from the ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) patient subgroup who received chemotherapy after radium-223 or placebo treatment, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy following radium-223.  Methods:   In ALSYMPCA, CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases were randomized 2:1 to receive six injections of radium-223 (50 kBq/kg IV) or placebo plus best standard of care, stratified by prior docetaxel, baseline alkaline phosphatase, and current bisphosphonate use. In this exploratory analysis, chemotherapy agents administered following study treatment were identified; timing and duration were calculated. Hematologic safety was reviewed, and overall survival analyzed.  Results:   Overall, 142 radium-223 and 64 placebo patients received subsequent chemotherapy; most common were docetaxel (70% radium-223, 72% placebo) and mitoxantrone (16% radium-223, 20% placebo). The majority of patients (61% radium-223, 58% placebo) had received prior docetaxel. Radium-223 patients started subsequent chemotherapy later than placebo patients; chemotherapy duration was similar between groups. In radium-223 and placebo patients receiving subsequent chemotherapy, median hematologic values (hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets) remained nearly constant up to 18 months following start of chemotherapy, regardless of prior docetaxel treatment. A low percentage of patients in both groups had grades 3-4 hematologic values (<10%). Platelet count decline, from last measurement before chemotherapy, was numerically greater in radium-223 versus placebo patients. Median overall survivals from start of chemotherapy were 16.0 and 15.8 months following radium-223 and placebo, respectively.  Conclusions:   Chemotherapy following radium-223, regardless of prior docetaxel, is feasible and appears to be well tolerated in patients with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases.

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic capabilities of susceptibility-weighted imaging in detecting prostate cancer and prostatic calcifications. A total number of 156 men, including 34 with prostate cancer and 122 with benign prostate were enrolled in this study. Computed tomography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and susceptibility-weighted imaging were performed on all the patients. One hundred and twelve prostatic calcifications were detected in 87 patients. The sensitivities and specificities of the conventional magnetic resonance imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, and susceptibility-filtered phase images in detecting prostate cancer and prostatic calcifications were calculated. McNemar's Chi-square test was used to compare the differences in sensitivities and specificities between the techniques. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of susceptibility-filtered phase images in detecting prostatic cancer were greater than that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (P < 0.05). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of susceptibility-filtered phase images in detecting prostatic calcifications were comparable to that of computed tomography and greater than that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (P < 0.05). Given the high incidence of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) abnormality in prostate cancer, we conclude that susceptibility-weighted imaging is more sensitive and specific than conventional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and computed tomography in detecting prostate cancer. Furthermore, susceptibility-weighted imaging can identify prostatic calcifications similar to computed tomography, and it is much better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging.""","""['Shewei Dou', 'Yan Bai', 'Ankit Shandil', 'Degang Ding', 'Dapeng Shi', 'E Mark Haacke', 'Meiyun Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Susceptibility weighted imaging: a new tool in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and detection of prostatic calcification.', 'Potential of quantitative susceptibility mapping for detection of prostatic calcifications.', 'Detection of prostate cancer with magnetic resonance imaging: optimization of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, dynamic-enhanced T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging apparent diffusion coefficient mapping sequences and MR spectroscopy, correlated with biopsy and histopathological findings.', 'Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Basics, Advantages, Cautions, and Future Prospects.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: problems and capabilities.', 'A novel approach to quantify calcifications of thyroid nodules in US images based on deep learning: predicting the risk of cervical lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer patients.', 'Analysis of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Value and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Parameters of Prostate Cancer Patients after Diagnosis and Treatment with Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Based on biomedical index data: Risk prediction model for prostate cancer.', 'PEG-coated and Gd-loaded fluorescent silica nanoparticles for targeted prostate cancer magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging.', 'Diagnostic performance of susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of calcifications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Tumour markers in CRC are extensively researched, and there's still debate on their diagnostic and prognostic values.  Methods:   In this hospital-based longitudinal study in north India, 51 male diagnosed CRC cases (pre-chemotherapy) were contrasted against 50 age and sex matched controls. Nine biomarkers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prolactin (PRL), alfa feto protein (AFP), total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and ferritin were measured by direct chemiluminescence technique. Further, follow-up was done on 47 cases after treatment with six cycles of 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin.  Results:   Mean serum CEA (case: 5.94±8.27 ng/mL, control: 2.5±0.79 ng/mL, P<0.05), PRL (case: 28.12±13.39 ng/mL, control: 14.24±13.13 ng/mL, P<0.0001), AFP (case: 10.9±6.65 ng/mL, control: 4.02±1.26 ng/mL, P<0.0001) levels were significantly raised in CRC cases compared to controls. On the contrary, mean testosterone level (P<0.05) was lower among the cases. After chemotherapy, the mean serum CEA (P<0.05), AFP (P<0.0001) and CA-125 (P<0.05) levels among the cases decreased significantly compared to their pretreatment levels.

Telomerase activity is primarily regulated at the level of transcription of its catalytic unit- hTERT. Prostate cancer (PCa), akin to other cancers, is characterized by high telomerase activity. Existing data suggest that hTERT expression and telomerase activity are positively regulated by androgenic stimuli in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) cells. A part of the present study reaffirmed this by demonstrating a decline in the hTERT expression and telomerase activity on ""loss of AR"" in ADPC cells. The study further addressed 2 unresolved queries, i) whether AR-mediated signaling is of any relevance to hTERT expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and ii) whether this signaling involves EGR1. Our data suggest that AR-mediated signaling negatively regulates hTERT expression in CRPC cells. Incidental support for the possibility of EGR1 being a regulator of hTERT expression in PCa was provided by i) immunolocalization of hTERT and EGR1 proteins in the same cell type (secretory epithelium) of PCa and BPH tissues; ii) significantly (p< 0.001) higher levels of both these proteins in CRPC (PC3 and DU145), compared with ADPC (LNCaP) cells. A direct evidence for the role of EGR1 in hTERT expression was evident by a significant (p<0.0001) decrease in the hTERT transcript levels in the EGR1-silenced CRPC cells. Further, ""gain of AR"" led to a significant reduction in the levels of hTERT and EGR1 in CRPC cells. However, restoration of EGR1 levels prevented the decline in the hTERT transcript levels in these cells. Taken together, our data indicate that AR regulates the expression of EGR1, which in turn acts as a positive regulator of hTERT expression in CRPC cells. Thus, AR exerts an inhibitory effect on hTERT expression and telomerase activity by modulating EGR1 levels in CRPC cells.""","""['Sheeba Jacob', 'Sumeet Nayak', 'Ruchi Kakar', 'Uddhav K Chaudhari', 'Dolly Joshi', 'Babu R Vundinti', 'Gwendolyn Fernandes', 'Ram S Barai', 'Sanjeeva D Kholkute', 'Geetanjali Sachdeva']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Wild-type but not mutant androgen receptor inhibits expression of the hTERT telomerase subunit: a novel role of AR mutation for prostate cancer development.', 'Telomerase as an important target of androgen signaling blockade for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal regulation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression in steroid-regulated tissues and cancer.', 'MUC1-C Dictates JUN and BAF-Mediated Chromatin Remodeling at Enhancer Signatures in Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Questioning the evidence behind the Saturation Model for testosterone replacement therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Egr-1 mediates leptin-induced PPARγ reduction and proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.']"""

AuNPs functionalized with thioctic-BBN displayed the highest in vitro cellular internalization (≈ 25%, 15 min) in gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor expressing cancer cells. However, these results fail to translate to in vivo tumor uptake. Biodistribution studies following intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration of nanoconjugates in tumor bearing mice indicated that the presence of BBN influences to some degree the biological profile of the nanoconstructs. For IV administration, the receptor-mediated pathway appears to be outweighed by the EPR effect. By contrast, in IP administration, it is reasoned that the GRPr-mediated mechanism plays a role in pancreas uptake.""","""['Francisco Silva', 'Ajit Zambre', 'Maria Paula Cabral Campello', 'Lurdes Gano', 'Isabel Santos', 'Ana Maria Ferraria', 'Maria João Ferreira', 'Amolak Singh', 'Anandhi Upendran', 'António Paulo', 'Raghuraman Kannan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Image-Guided Nanodelivery of Pt(IV) Prodrugs to GRP-Receptor Positive Tumors.', 'Bombesin functionalized gold nanoparticles show in vitro and in vivo cancer receptor specificity.', 'Synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of a high-affinity and metabolically stabilized 18F-labeled bombesin analogue for molecular imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'microPET and autoradiographic imaging of GRP receptor expression with 64Cu-DOTA-Lys3bombesin in human prostate adenocarcinoma xenografts.', 'Water-Soluble Chitosan Conjugated DOTA-Bombesin Peptide Capped Gold Nanoparticles as a Targeted Therapeutic Agent for Prostate Cancer.', 'Image-Guided Nanodelivery of Pt(IV) Prodrugs to GRP-Receptor Positive Tumors.', 'Dose Rate Effects on the Selective Radiosensitization of Prostate Cells by GRPR-Targeted Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Radiolabeled Gold Nanoseeds Decorated with Substance P Peptides: Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Evaluation in Glioblastoma Cellular Models.', 'Modified Gold Nanoparticles to Overcome the Chemoresistance to Gemcitabine in Mutant p53 Cancer Cells.', 'Sono-Biosynthesis and Characterization of AuNPs from Danube Delta Nymphaea alba Root Extracts and Their Biological Properties.']"""

Methods:   Between 2003 and 2010, 174 consecutive patients were treated with ART (median dose 71 Gy) at a single institution. Subsequently, we assigned a score of 1 to the following risk factors (RF): T stage ≥3b, presurgical PSA ≥10 ng/mL, pathologic Gleason score (GS) ≥4 + 3, and positive surgical margin (R1). The scores were then summed to stratify the population into low risk (LR), intermediate risk (IR), and high risk (HR).  Results:   Median follow-up was 61 months (range 4-105). Five-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS), and overall survival (OS) were respectively 93%, 97.1%, and 98.6%. On univariate analyses, GS was the only variable related to bRFS (p = 0.04) and to cRFS (p = 0.05). Any variable was related to OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that HR patients (3-4 RF) had a worse bRFS (p = 0.02) compared to LR patients (0 RF or R1 as single RF); IR patients (1-2 RF) had a lower bRFS compared to LR patients (p = 0.06). Patients with R1 as single RF have the same bRFS as patients with 0 RF (p = 0.6) and are considered as LR patients.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant radiotherapy leads to excellent bRFS and cRFS rates at 5 years (93.3% and 97.1%, respectively) in our population. Patients with multiple RF are at higher risk of bRFS.

The IRVS is designed to perform a complete workflow for pre-treatment range verification and adjustment. It contains specifically designed dosimetry and electronic hardware and a specific software for workflow control with database connection to the treatment and imaging systems. An essential part of the IRVS system is an array of Si-diode detectors, designed to be mounted to the endorectal water balloon routinely used for prostate immobilization. The diodes can measure dose rate as function of time from which the water equivalent path length (WEPL) and the dose received are extracted. The former is used for pre-treatment beam range verification and correction, if necessary, while the latter is to monitor the dose delivered to patient rectum during the treatment and serves as an additional verification. The entire IRVS workflow was tested for anterior and 30 degree inclined proton beam in both solid water and anthropomorphic pelvic phantoms, with the measured WEPL and rectal doses compared to the treatment plan. Gafchromic films were also used for measurement of the rectal dose and compared to IRVS results. The WEPL measurement accuracy was in the order of 1 mm and after beam range correction, the dose received by the rectal wall were 1.6% and 0.4% from treatment planning, respectively, for the anterior and anterior oblique field. We believe the implementation of IRVS would make the treatment of prostate with anterior proton beams more accurate and reliable.""","""['M Hoesl', 'S Deepak', 'M Moteabbed', 'G Jassens', 'J Orban', 'Y K Park', 'K Parodi', 'E H Bentefour', 'H M Lu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Validation of an in-vivo proton beam range check method in an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom using dose measurements.', 'Proton therapy of prostate cancer by anterior-oblique beams: implications of setup and anatomy variations.', 'Using CBCT for pretreatment range check in proton therapy: a phantom study for prostate treatment by anterior-posterior beam.', 'Proton dose calculation on scatter-corrected CBCT image: Feasibility study for adaptive proton therapy.', 'Dosimetry of clinical neutron and proton beams: an overview of recommendations.', 'Dataset for predicting single-spot proton ranges in proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Towards real-time PGS range monitoring in proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Roadmap: proton therapy physics and biology.', 'Online daily adaptive proton therapy.', 'In vivo range verification in particle therapy.']"""

Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a charge-deficient isosteric analogue of the polyamine spermidine (Spd) and a Cu(II)-chelating compound used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, and it has been implicated as a potential anticancer therapeutic drug. In the present study, we studied the effects of TETA in comparison with two other Cu(II)-chelators, D-penicillamine (PA) and tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), on polyamine metabolism in DU145 prostate carcinoma, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. TETA induced antizyme, down-regulated ODC and inhibited [(14)C] Spd uptake. Moreover, it completely prevented α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced increase in [(14)C] Spd uptake, and inhibited [(14)C] putrescine (Put) uptake and ODC activity in vivo Seven-day treatment of DU145 cells with TETA caused growth cessation by reducing intracellular polyamine levels and suppressing the formation of hypusinated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). TETA or its N-acetylated metabolites also inhibited spermine (Spm), diamine and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases and decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, TETA inhibited the utilization of Put as energy source via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as indicated by decreased production of (14)CO2 from [(14)C] Put.

Recently, we reported that breast cancer cells utilize the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to exit the blood circulation and lodge to the skeleton of experimental animals. Now, we show that CX3CR1 is overexpressed in human breast tumors and skeletal metastases. To assess the clinical potential of targeting CX3CR1 in breast cancer, a functional role of CX3CR1 in metastatic seeding and progression was first validated using a neutralizing antibody for this receptor and transcriptional suppression by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). Successively, we synthesized and characterized JMS-17-2, a potent and selective small-molecule antagonist of CX3CR1, which was used in preclinical animal models of seeding and established metastasis. Importantly, counteracting CX3CR1 activation impairs the lodging of circulating tumor cells to the skeleton and soft-tissue organs and also negatively affects further growth of established metastases. Furthermore, nine genes were identified that were similarly altered by JMS-17-2 and CRISPRi and could sustain CX3CR1 prometastatic activity. In conclusion, these data support the drug development of CX3CR1 antagonists, and promoting their clinical use will provide novel and effective tools to prevent or contain the progression of metastatic disease in breast cancer patients.  Implications:   This work conclusively validates the instrumental role of CX3CR1 in the seeding of circulating cancer cells and is expected to pave the way for pairing novel inhibitors of this receptor with current standards of care for the treatment of breast cancer patients.

Despite the excellent anti-tumor effect of docetaxel, its severe adverse effects sometimes distress patients. Therefore, it would be very helpful to predict the efficacy of docetaxel before treatment. The aims of this study were to evaluate the potential value of patient characteristics in predicting overall survival (OS) and to develop a risk classification for CRPC patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.  Methods:   This study included 79 patients with CRPC treated with docetaxel. The variables, including patient characteristics at diagnosis and at the start of chemotherapy, were retrospectively collected. Prognostic factors predicting OS were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Risk stratification for overall survival was determined based on the results of multivariate analysis.  Results:   PSA response ≥50 % was observed in 55 (69.6 %) of all patients, and the median OS was 22.5 months. The multivariate analysis showed that age, serum PSA level at the start of chemotherapy, and Hb were independent prognostic factors for OS. In addition, ECOG performance status (PS) and the CRP-to-albumin ratio were not significant but were considered possible predictors for OS. Risk stratification according to the number of these risk factors could effectively stratify CRPC patients treated with docetaxel in terms of OS.  Conclusions:   Age, serum PSA level at the start of chemotherapy, and Hb were identified as independent prognostic factors of OS. ECOG PS and the CRP-to-albumin ratio were not significant, but were considered possible predictors for OS in Japanese CRPC patients treated with docetaxel.

Objective:   To compare the HRQoL of patients who underwent SRT with that of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) only and to investigate whether SRT timing is associated with HRQoL.  Design, setting, and participants:   All SRT patients (n=241) and all RP-only patients (n=1005) were selected from a prospective database (2004-2015). The database contained HRQoL and prostate problem assessments up to 2 yr after last treatment.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   Mixed effects growth modelling adjusting for significant differences in patient characteristics and baseline HRQoL was used to analyze the association between: (1) ""treatment"" (RP-only vs SRT) and (2) ""timing of SRT"" with changes in HRQoL.  Results and limitations:   SRT patients showed significantly (p<0.05) poorer recovery from urinary, bowel, and erectile function after their last treatment (clinically meaningful difference for urinary and erectile function). Patients with a longer interval (≥ 7 mo) between RP and SRT reported significantly better sexual satisfaction after SRT (p=0.02), and a better urinary function recovery (p=0.03). Limitations of the study include the nonrandom design and the variability in timing of HRQoL measurements.  Conclusions:   Up to 2 yr after treatment, SRT patients reported poorer HRQoL in several HRQoL domains compared with RP-only patients, but not in overall HRQoL. Delaying the start of SRT after RP may limit the incidence and duration of urinary and sexual problems.

Material and method:   An observational cohort study of 982 patients with LPC treated with RP selected from our department's PC registry database. A competing risk analysis was performed, calculating the probability of CSM in the presence of the competing risk of MOC. Cumulative incidence curves were constructed, and point estimates were performed at 5, 10 and 15 years. The analysis was stratified by age (≤65 vs. >65 years) and risk group: low (Gleason score ≤6 and pT2abc); intermediate (Gleason score of 7 and pT2abc) and high (Gleason score of 8-10 or pT3ab).  Results:   With a median follow-up of 60 months, the overall probability of dying from PC was 3.5%, and the probability of dying from other causes was 9%. A competing effect for MOC was observed. The risk of MOC was almost 3 times greater than that of CSM. This effect remained for all risk groups, although its magnitude decreased progressively according to the risk group level. At 10 years, CSM was only 0%, 1% and 2% for the low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively, while the likelihood of MOC was 4%, 4% and 10%, respectively. The mortality risk was shown after 10years of follow-up and was higher for other causes not attributable to PC and for patients older than 65years.  Conclusions:   The benefit of RP might be overestimated, given that the risk of MOC is greater than that of CSM, regardless of the age group and risk group, especially after 10years of follow-up. The only parameter that varied was the magnitude of the CSM/MOC ratio. This information could help in choosing the active treatment for patients with LPC and short life expectancies.""","""['J L Ruiz-Cerdá', 'A Soto-Poveda', 'S Luján-Marco', 'A Loras-Monfort', 'M Trassierra-Villa', 'R Rogel-Bertó', 'F Boronat-Tormo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Very long-term survival patterns of young patients treated with radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'A competing risk analysis of cancer-specific mortality of initial treatment with radical prostatectomy versus radiation therapy in clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Specific Mortality Among Korean Men with Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy: A Multi-Center Study Using Propensity Scoring and Competing Risk Regression Analyses.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'A Competing Risk Model Nomogram to Predict the Long-Term Prognosis of Lung Carcinoid.', 'Risk Factors, Prognosis, and a New Nomogram for Predicting Cancer-Specific Survival Among Lung Cancer Patients with Brain Metastasis: A Retrospective Study Based on SEER.']"""

The present study on troxerutin highlights its abilities to bind DNA and enhance cancer cell killing in response to radiation. Troxerutin showed strong binding with calf thymus DNA in vitro. Troxerutin-DNA interaction was confirmed by CD spectropolarimetry. The mode of binding of troxerutin to DNA was assessed by competing troxerutin with EtBr or DAPI, known DNA intercalator and a minor groove binder, respectively. DAPI fluorescence was drastically reduced with linear increase in troxerutin concentration suggesting possible binding of troxerutin to DNA minor groove. Further, computational studies of docking of troxerutin molecule on mammalian DNA also indicated possible troxerutin-DNA interaction at minor groove of DNA. Troxerutin was found to mainly localize in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells. It induced cytotoxicity in radioresistant (DU145) and sensitive (PC3) prostate cancer cells. When troxerutin pre-treated DU145 and PC3 cells were exposed to γ-radiation, cytotoxicity as estimated by MTT assay, was found to be further enhanced. In addition, the % subG1 population detected by propidium iodide staining also showed similar response when combined with radiation. A similar trend was observed in terms of ROS generation and DNA damage in DU145 cells when troxerutin and radiation were combined. DNA binding at minor groove by troxerutin may have contributed to strand breaks leading to increased radiation induced cell death.""","""['Niranjan A Panat', 'Beena G Singh', 'Dharmendra K Maurya', 'Santosh K Sandur', 'Saroj S Ghaskadbi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Spectroscopic and molecular docking studies on the interaction of troxerutin with DNA.', 'Protection of cellular DNA from gamma-radiation-induced damages and enhancement in DNA repair by troxerutin.', 'Troxerutin induces protective effects against ultraviolet B radiation through the alteration of microRNA expression in human HaCaT keratinocyte cells.', 'Flavonoids and genomic instability induced by ionizing radiation.', 'Chemistry of DNA minor groove binding agents.', 'Pretreatment with troxerutin protects/improves neurological deficits in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.', 'Anticancer potential of phytochemicals from Oroxylum indicum targeting Lactate Dehydrogenase A through bioinformatic approach.', 'Cheminformatics Identification of Phenolics as Modulators of Penicillin-Binding Protein 2a of Staphylococcus aureus: A Structure-Activity-Relationship-Based Study.', 'Biological and Therapeutic Effects of Troxerutin: Molecular Signaling Pathways Come into View.', 'Smart, Naturally-Derived Macromolecules for Controlled Drug Release.']"""

This study sought to determine if MetS is associated with adverse final pathology and risk of overall recurrence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Men undergoing RP (2004-2013) were identified using our prospectively maintained institutional database. MetS was defined by ≥3 of 5 components (obesity, dysglycemia, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high triglycerides). Multivariable logistic regression models were created for prostate cancer grade and stage on final pathology. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to model overall recurrence, defined by biochemical recurrence (postoperative serum prostate-specific antigen ≥0.2 ng/mL) or use of salvage therapies.  Results:   Of 1939 men, 439 (22.6%) had MetS. MetS (≥3 vs. 0 components) was associated with an increased odds of Gleason 8-10 disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-4.67, P = .005) and extraprostatic disease (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02-1.80, P = .04). Decreased use of nerve-sparing in men with MetS was noted. In unadjusted analyses, MetS was associated with a significantly increased risk of receiving salvage therapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.04-1.83, P = .03) and a near-significant increased overall recurrence risk (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.94-1.53, P = .15). These associations were attenuated upon adjusting for disease-specific parameters (salvage therapy: HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.76-1.40, P = .87; overall recurrence: HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.72-1.21, P = .62).  Conclusion:   MetS is associated with an increased odds of extraprostatic and high-grade disease on final RP pathology, which appears to drive an increased risk of needing salvage therapy after RP. However, with more aggressive resection, differences in failure-free outcomes were attenuated, suggesting that men with MetS should not be precluded from RP.""","""['Bimal Bhindi', 'Wen Y Xie', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Michael Nesbitt', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'Andrew Evans', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Neil E Fleshner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Metabolic syndrome is associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy: results from a multicentre prospective study.', 'Impact of metabolic syndrome on oncologic outcomes at radical prostatectomy.', 'Metabolic syndrome and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with adverse pathological features in patients with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Meta-analysis of metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'The association between metabolic syndrome and the risk of prostate cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, advanced prostate cancer, prostate cancer-specific mortality and biochemical recurrence.', 'Metabolically Abnormal Obesity Increases the Risk of Advanced Prostate Cancer in Chinese Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Serum lipids might improve prostate-specific antigen sensitivity in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy for suspected prostate cancer: A pilot study.', 'Influence of serum total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride on prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Diet and lifestyle considerations for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of lipid profiles after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Afterwards, this classification was demonstrated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The classification of BPH is important, as patients with different types of BPH can have different symptoms and treatment options. BPH types on MRI are as follows: type 0, an equal to or less than 25 cm3 prostate showing little or no zonal enlargements; type 1, bilateral transition zone (TZ) enlargement; type 2, retrourethral enlargement; type 3, bilateral TZ and retrourethral enlargement; type 4, pedunculated enlargement; type 5, pedunculated with bilateral TZ and/or retrourethral enlargement; type 6, subtrigonal or ectopic enlargement; type 7, other combinations of enlargements. We retrospectively evaluated MRI images of BPH patients who were histologically diagnosed and presented the different types of BPH on MRI.

The cost of prostate cancer care is expected to reach $15.1 billion by the year 2020, up from $11.9 billion in 2010. Given the high burden of prostate cancer, health care payers are interested in quantifying the potential budget impact of new therapies.  Objective:   To estimate the budget impact of enzalutamide for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) from a U.S. payer perspective.  Methods:   A model was developed to assess the budget impact of enzalutamide for treatment of chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients in a hypothetical 1-million-member U.S. health plan over a 1-year time horizon. Comparators included abiraterone acetate, sipuleucel-T, radium Ra 223 dichloride, and docetaxel. Epidemiologic data, including National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) incidence rates, were used to estimate the number of chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients. Dosing, administration, duration of therapy, and adverse event rates were based on package inserts and pivotal studies. Drug costs were obtained from RED BOOK and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) average sales price pricing files, costs of administration and monitoring from the CMS physician fee schedule, and adverse events from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and published literature. Market shares were estimated for each comparator before and after adoption of enzalutamide. The incremental aggregate budget impact, per patient per year (PPPY), per patient per month (PPPM), and per member per month (PMPM), was calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   In a population of 115 chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients, adopting enzalutamide had an annual incremental budget impact of $510,641 ($4,426 PPPY, $369 PPPM, and $0.04 PMPM). Results were most sensitive to enzalutamide drug cost, size of the chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patient population, and enzalutamide adoption rate.  Conclusions:   Results indicate a modest 1-year budget impact of adopting enzalutamide for chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients, partly because of the cost offset of a moderate incidence of adverse events and lack of additional required monitoring.""","""['Cat N Bui', ""Ken O'Day"", 'Scott Flanders', 'Nina Oestreicher', 'Peter Francis', 'Linda Posta', 'Breanna Popelar', 'Hong Tang', 'Mark Balk']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Manag Care Spec Pharm""","""['Budget Impact of Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Budgetary Impact of Cabazitaxel Use After Docetaxel Treatment for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Is the Scope of Costs Considered in Budget Impact Analyses for Anticancer Drugs Rational?

Although its genetic background is thoroughly investigated, rather little is known about the role of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) in this disease. tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) represent a new class of sncRNAs, which are present in a broad range of species and have been reported to play a role in several cellular processes. Here, we analyzed the expression of tRFs in fresh frozen patient samples derived from normal adjacent prostate and different stages of PCa by RNA-sequencing. We identified 598 unique tRFs, many of which are deregulated in cancer samples when compared to normal adjacent tissue. Most of the identified tRFs are derived from the 5'- and 3'-ends of mature cytosolic tRNAs, but we also found tRFs produced from other parts of tRNAs, including pre-tRNA trailers and leaders, as well as tRFs from mitochondrial tRNAs. The 5'-derived tRFs comprise the most abundant class of tRFs in general and represent the major class among upregulated tRFs. The 3'-derived tRFs types are dominant among downregulated tRFs in PCa. We validated the expression of three tRFs using qPCR. The ratio of tRFs derived from tRNALysCTT and tRNAPheGAA emerged as a good indicator of progression-free survival and a candidate prognostic marker. This study provides a systematic catalogue of tRFs and their dysregulation in PCa and can serve as the basis for further research on the biomarker potential and functional roles of tRFs in this disease.""","""['Michael Olvedy', 'Mauro Scaravilli', 'Youri Hoogstrate', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Guido Jenster', 'Elena S Martens-Uzunova']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['tRF2Cancer: A web server to detect tRNA-derived small RNA fragments (tRFs) and their expression in multiple cancers.', 'tRNA-derived fragments and tRNA halves: The new players in cancers.', 'tRNA-Derived RNA Fragments Are Novel Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Tumor Subtypes in Prostate Cancer.', 'tRNA-derived fragments: Mechanisms underlying their regulation of gene expression and potential applications as therapeutic targets in cancers and virus infections.', 'Extracellular vesicles-associated tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs): biogenesis, biological functions, and their role as potential biomarkers in human diseases.', 'Cytoplasmically localized tRNA-derived fragments inhibit translation in Drosophila S2 cells.', 'METTL1 promotes tumorigenesis through tRNA-derived fragment biogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Role of tRNA-derived small RNAs(tsRNAs) in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumours.', 'Plasma tRF-16-79MP9PD and tRF-28-OB1690PQR304 as potential biomarkers for 4- to 7-year-old children with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome.', 'Systematic and Comprehensive Analysis of tRNA-Derived Small RNAs Reveals Their Potential Regulatory Roles and Clinical Relevance in Sarcoidosis.']"""

Cell viability was significantly reduced upon lycopene treatment at physiologically attainable concentrations. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion did not change upon lycopene treatment. Ovarian cancer spheroids initially showed a decreased proliferation and after 14 days increased cell viability upon lycopene treatment, confirming the potential of lycopene to reduce cancer cell growth in short-term cultures and also indicate enhanced cell viability over prolonged exposure.

The target gene in this study is Dihydro-pyrimidinase-like 3 (DPYSL3, protein name CRMP4), which was identified as a metastatic suppressor in prostate cancers. There are two transcriptional variants of DPYSL3 gene in human genome, of which the variant 2 is the dominant transcript (DPYSL3v2, CRMP4a) but is also significantly down-regulated in primary prostate cancers. A total of 8 saRNAs for DPYSL3v1 and 14 saRNAs for DPYSL3v2 were tested in multiple prostate cancer cell lines. While none of the saRNAs significantly altered DPYSL3v1 expression, 4 saRNAs showed a strong enhancing effect on DPYSL3v2 expression, resulting in reduced cell mobility in vitro. To achieve a prostate cancer-specific delivery for in vivo testing, we conjugated the most potent saV2-9 RNA molecule with the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting aptamer A10-3.2. The conjugates successful increased DPYSL3v2 gene expression in PSMA-positive but not PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells.

We aimed to determine how increasing the PCa biologically equivalent dose (BED) of external radiation therapy (RT) is correlated with FFBF and overall patient outcomes: overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM), and cancer-specific mortality (CSM); as well as genitourinary (GU), and gastrointestinal toxicities.  Materials and methods:   We performed a meta-analysis of 6884 PCa patients from 12 randomized-controlled trials of external beam RT. Mixed effects regression models were used to estimate weighted linear relationships between BED and observed percentages of 5- and 10-year outcomes. For toxicities, a subset analysis of using 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) versus intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) was performed.  Results:   Increasing BED correlated with improved FFBF: 10-year absolute improvement of 9.6% and 7.2% for low-risk and intermediate-risk patients, respectively (P<0.05); but not with improvement of OS, DM, or CSM at either time point. BED escalation was not correlated with increased acute toxicities; it was correlated with increased late gastrointestinal toxicities in patients treated with 3D-CRT (1.5% increase over BED range, P<0.01). IMRT patients had significantly fewer late toxicities, despite being treated at higher BED.  Conclusions:   RT BED escalation has resulted in significantly improved PCa FFBF at up to 10 years; but not with improvement in OS, DM, or CSM. Thus, FFBF is a poor surrogate of overall patient outcomes for trials of RT. Late toxicities were less frequent with IMRT than with 3D-CRT, even at higher BED.""","""['Nicholas G Zaorsky', 'Scott W Keith', 'Talha Shaikh', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Robert B Den']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Late Side Effects After Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Compared to 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results From 2 Prospective Cohorts.', 'What is the ideal radiotherapy dose to treat prostate cancer?

In alternative to PSA, ultrasensitive PSA (uPSA) and [-2]proPSA could be potentially useful in recurrent disease detection. This research focused on [-2]proPSA and uPSA fluctuations over time and their possible clinical and pathological determinants, in the first year after RP.  Methods:   A cohort of 106 consecutive patients, undergoing RP for high-risk prostate cancer (pT3/pT4 and/or positive margins), was enrolled. No patient received either preoperative/postoperative androgen deprivation therapy or immediate adjuvant RT, this latter for patient choice. [-2]proPSA and uPSA were measured at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after RP; their trends over time were estimated by the mixed-effects linear model. The uPSA relapse was defined either as 3 rising uPSA values after nadir or 2 consecutive uPSA >0.2 ng/ml after RP.  Results:   The biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate at 1 year after RP was either 38.6 % (in case of 3 rising uPSA values) or 34.9 % (in case of PSA >0.2 ng/ml after nadir), respectively. The main risk factors for uPSA fluctuations over time were PSA at diagnosis >8 ng/ml (p = 0.014), pT (p = 0.038) and pN staging (p = 0.001). In turn, PSA at diagnosis >8 ng/ml (p = 0.012) and pN (p < 0.001) were the main determinants for [-2]proPSA trend over time. In a 39 patients subgroup, uPSA decreased from month 1 to 3, while [-2]proPSA increased in 90 % of them; subsequently, both uPSA and [-2]proPSA increased in almost all cases. The [-2]proPSA trend over time was independent from BCR status either in the whole cohort as well in the 39 men subgroup.  Conclusions:   Both uPSA and [-2]proPSA had independent significant fluctuations over time. PSA at diagnosis >8 ng/ml and pathological staging significantly modified both these trends over time. Since BCR was not confirmed as determinant of [-2]proPSA fluctuations, its use as marker of early biochemical relapse may not be actually recommended, in an high-risk prostate cancer patients population.""","""['S De Luca', 'R Passera', 'A Sottile', 'C Fiori', 'R M Scarpa', 'F Porpiglia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Parameters derived from the postoperative decline in ultrasensitive PSA improve the prediction of radical prostatectomy outcome.', 'Detectable Prostate-specific antigen value between 0.01 and 0.1\xa0ng/ml following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP): does it correlate with future biochemical recurrence?', 'First Postprostatectomy Ultrasensitive Prostate-specific Antigen Predicts Survival in Patients with High-risk Prostate Cancer Pathology.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Potential inclusion of prostate cancer in the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum is relevant for family classification, risk estimates and surveillance recommendations in mutation carriers.  Methods:   We used the population-based Danish HNPCC-register to identify all prostate cancers that developed in mutation carriers and in their first-degree relatives from 288 Lynch syndrome families. The tumors were evaluated for clinicopathologic features and mismatch-repair status, and the cumulative risk of prostate cancer was determined.  Results:   In total, 28 prostate cancers developed in 16 mutation carriers and in 12 first-degree relatives at a median age of 63 years. The majority of the tumors were high-grade tumors with Gleason scores 8-10. Prostate cancer was associated with mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 with loss of the respective mismatch repair protein in 69 % of the tumors, though a MSI-high phenotype was restricted to 13 % of the tumors. The cumulative risk of prostate cancer at age 70 was 3.7 % (95 % CI: 2.3-4.9).

Subcutaneous transplant models are widely used with both cancer cell lines and human-tumor specimens. Recently, subcutaneous models of patient tumors, termed patient-derived xenographs (PDX) have become highly popular and have acquired such names as ""Avatar"" and ""Xenopatients."" However, such s.c. models rarely metastasize and are therefore not patient-like. In contrast, orthotopic models have the capability to metastasize. If intact fragments of tumor tissue are implanted by surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI), the metastatic potential can match that of the donor patient. The present study images in real time, using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, the very different tumor behavior at the orthotopic and subcutaneous sites of human prostate cancer PC-3 in athymic nude mice. By day-2 after tumor implantation, the orthotopic tumor is already highly vascularized and the cancer cells have begun to migrate out of the tumor. In contrast, the subcutaneous tumor only begins to be vascularized by day-3 and cells do not migrate from the tumor. Angiogenesis is much more extensive in the orthotopic tumor throughout the 2-week observation period. The orthotopic PC-3-GFP tumor progresses very rapidly and distinct metastasis have appeared in lymph nodes by day-3 which rapidly appear in many areas of the abdominal cavity including portal lymph nodes by day-7. At day-14, no invasion or metastasis was observed with the s.c. tumor even when the animal was extensively explored. These results explain why orthotopic tumors mimimc clinical metastatic tumors in nude mice and why subcutaneous tumors do not. J. Cell.

The TMPRSS2-ERG fusion event and the overexpression of the transcription factor ERG are present in approximately 50% of all prostate cancer patients, however, the clinical outcome is still controversial. Prostate tumors produce various soluble factors, including the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6, regulating cellular processes such as proliferation and metastatic segregation. Here, we used prostatectomy samples in a tissue microarray format and analyzed the co-expression and the clinicopathologic data of ERG and IL-6 using immunohistochemical double staining and correlated the read-out with clinicopathologic data. Expression of ERG and IL-6 correlated strongly in prostate tissue samples. Forced expression of ERG in prostate tumor cell lines resulted in significantly increased secretion of IL-6, whereas the down-regulation of ERG decreased IL-6 secretion. By dissecting the underlying mechanism in prostate tumor cell lines we show the ERG-mediated up-regulation of the prostanoid receptors EP2 and EP3. The prostanoid receptor EP2 was overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissue. Furthermore, the proliferation rate and IL-6 secretion in DU145 cells was reduced after treatment with EP2-receptor antagonist.

Our results demonstrated that activated AR induced miR-203 and reduced SRC levels in PCa model systems. miR-203 directly binds to the 3' UTR of SRC and regulates the stability of SRC mRNA upon AR activation.

We have also demonstrated that GAS6 secreted from osteoblasts in the bone marrow environment plays a critical role in establishing prostate tumor cell dormancy. Here we investigated the role that endogenous GAS6 and Mer receptor signaling plays in establishing prostate cancer stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.We first observed that high levels of endogenous GAS6 are expressed by disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow, whereas relatively low levels of endogenous GAS6 are expressed in PCa tumors grown in a s.c.  Setting:   Interestingly, elevated levels of endogenous GAS6 were identified in putative cancer stem cells (CSCs, CD133+/CD44+) compared to non-CSCs (CD133-/CD44-) isolated from PCa/osteoblast cocultures in vitro and in DTCs isolated from the bone marrow 24 hours after intracardiac injection. Moreover, we found that endogenous GAS6 expression is associated with Mer receptor expression in growth arrested (G1) PCa cells, which correlates with the increase of the CSC populations. Importantly, we found that overexpression of GAS6 activates phosphorylation of Mer receptor signaling and subsequent induction of the CSC phenotype in vitro and in vivo.Together these data suggest that endogenous GAS6 and Mer receptor signaling contribute to the establishment of PCa CSCs in the bone marrow microenvironment, which may have important implications for targeting metastatic disease.""","""['Younghun Jung', 'Ann M Decker', 'Jingcheng Wang', 'Eunsohl Lee', 'Lulia A Kana', 'Kenji Yumoto', 'Frank C Cackowski', 'James Rhee', 'Peter Carmeliet', 'Laura Buttitta', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Russell S Taichman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The marrow niche controls the cancer stem cell phenotype of disseminated prostate cancer.', 'Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) Promotes Prostate Cancer Survival by G1 Arrest/S Phase Delay and Inhibition of Apoptosis During Chemotherapy in Bone Marrow.', 'Axl is required for TGF-β2-induced dormancy of prostate cancer cells in the bone marrow.', 'Targeting Gas6/TAM in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment.', 'Molecular insights of Gas6/TAM in cancer development and therapy.', 'Dormancy, stemness, and therapy resistance: interconnected players in cancer evolution.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'Monitoring Spontaneous Quiescence and Asynchronous Proliferation-Quiescence Decisions in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting MERTK and AXL in EGFR Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'The pathogenesis of bone metastasis in solid tumors: a review.']"""

Peripheral zone of the prostate gland possesses a stronger inclination for PCa than transition zone. We previously found a variety of genes that differently expressed among different prostate stromal cells, including LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) which highly expressed in peripheral zone derived stromal cells (PZSCs) and PCa associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compared to transition zone derived stromal cells (TZSCs). Studies on its role in tumors have highlighted LMO2 as an oncogene. Herein, we aim to study the potential mechanisms of stromal LMO2 in promoting PCa progression. The in vitro cells co-culture and in vivo cells recombination revealed that LMO2 over-expressed prostate stromal cells could promote the proliferation and invasiveness of either prostate epithelial or cancer cells. Further protein array screening confirmed that stromal LMO2 stimulated the secretion of Interleukin-11 (IL-11), which could promote proliferation and invasiveness of PCa cells via IL-11 receptor α (IL11Rα) - STAT3 signaling. Moreover, stromal LMO2 over-expression could suppress miR-204-5p which was proven to be a negative regulator of IL-11 expression. Taken together, results of our study demonstrate that prostate stromal LMO2 is capable of stimulating IL-11 secretion and by which activates IL11Rα - STAT3 signaling in PCa cells and then facilitates PCa progression. These results may make stromal LMO2 responsible for zonal characteristic of PCa and as a target for PCa microenvironment-targeted therapy.""","""['Chen-Yi Jiang', 'Jun-Jie Yu', 'Yuan Ruan', 'Xiao-Hai Wang', 'Wei Zhao', 'Xing-Jie Wang', 'Yi-Ping Zhu', 'Yuan Gao', 'Kui-Yuan Hao', 'Lei Chen', 'Bang-Min Han', 'Shu-Jie Xia', 'Fu-Jun Zhao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['LMO2 upregulation due to AR deactivation in cancer-associated fibroblasts induces non-cell-autonomous growth of prostate cancer after androgen deprivation.', 'Effect of prostate peripheral zones stromal cells on the proliferation of prostate cells by overexpression of LMO2 gene.', 'Expression of LMO2 in Prostate Carcinoma and Adjacent Prostatic Parenchyma.', 'Stromal cell interplay in prostate development, physiology, and pathological conditions.', 'LMO2 at 25 years: a paradigm of chromosomal translocation proteins.', 'RNA-binding protein Musashi2 stabilizing androgen receptor drives prostate cancer progression.', '5-ARI induces autophagy of prostate epithelial cells through suppressing IGF-1 expression in prostate fibroblasts.', 'Deregulation of ATG9A by impaired AR signaling induces autophagy in prostate stromal fibroblasts and promotes BPH progression.']"""

Methods and results:   Twenty-three genitourinary pathologists participated in the evaluation of 60 selected high-magnification photographs. The selection included 10 cases of Gleason grade 3, 40 of Gleason grade 4 (10 per growth pattern), and 10 of Gleason grade 5. Participants were asked to select a single predominant Gleason grade per case (3, 4, or 5), and to indicate the predominant Gleason grade 4 growth pattern, if present. 'Consensus' was defined as at least 80% agreement, and 'favoured' as 60-80% agreement. Consensus on Gleason grading was reached in 47 of 60 (78%) cases, 35 of which were assigned to grade 4. In the 13 non-consensus cases, ill-formed (6/13, 46%) and fused (7/13, 54%) patterns were involved in the disagreement. Among the 20 cases where at least one pathologist assigned the ill-formed growth pattern, none (0%, 0/20) reached consensus. Consensus for fused, cribriform and glomeruloid glands was reached in 2%, 23% and 38% of cases, respectively. In nine of 35 (26%) consensus Gleason grade 4 cases, participants disagreed on the growth pattern. Six of these were characterized by large epithelial proliferations with delicate intervening fibrovascular cores, which were alternatively given the designation fused or cribriform growth pattern ('complex fused').  Conclusions:   Consensus on Gleason grade 4 growth pattern was predominantly reached on cribriform and glomeruloid patterns, but rarely on ill-formed and fused glands.

Methods:   The authors randomly assigned 215 men who had localized prostate cancer to receive hypofractionated radiotherapy to a total dose of 70 grays (Gy) in 25 fractions (at 2.8 Gy per fraction) using either IMRT or 3DCRT. Acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were prospectively evaluated according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Biochemical control was defined according to the Phoenix criteria (prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL).  Results:   In total, 215 patients were enrolled in the IMRT group (n = 109) or the 3DCRT group (n = 106). The 3DCRT arm had a 27% rate of grade ≥ 2 acute GU toxicity compared with a 9% rate in the IMRT arm (P = .001) and a 24% rate of grade ≥ 2 acute GI toxicity compared with a 7% rate in the IMRT arm (P = .001). The maximal rate of grade ≥2 late GU toxicity during the entire period of follow-up was 3.7% in the IMRT group versus 12.3% in the 3DCRT group (P = .02). The maximal rate of grade ≥2 late GI toxicity during the entire follow-up was 6.4% in the IMRT group versus 21.7% in the 3DCRT group (P = .001). The 5-year rate of freedom from biochemical failure was 95.4% in the IMRT arm and 94.3% in the 3DCRT arm (P = .678).  Conclusions:   IMRT reduced the delivery of significant radiation doses to the bladder and rectum using a similar target volume. This dosimetric advantage resulted in a lower rate of acute/late grade ≥ 2 GI and GU toxicity for IMRT compared with 3DCRT.

We conducted a retrospective study in 76,733 male veterans with T2D during 2003 to 2012. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for covariates and propensity scores of metformin use and race/ethnic group membership was utilized to compute the HR of prostate cancer incidence associated with race/ethnicity and compare HR associated with metformin use between race/ethnic groups. Mean follow-up was 6.4 ± 2.8 years; 7% were Hispanics; 17% were African Americans (AA); mean age was 67.8 ± 9.8 years; 5.2% developed prostate cancer; and 38.9% used metformin. Among these diabetic men without metformin use, prostate cancer incidence was higher in Hispanics and AA than in non-Hispanic White (NHW). Use of metformin alone or metformin + statins was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics compared with NHW, but not between AA and NHW. Use of metformin + finasteride was associated with a greater prostate cancer incidence reduction in Hispanics and AA compared with NHW. Our results suggested that metformin treatment could be a potential strategy to reduce prostate cancer incidence in the minority populations who are at high risk for fatal prostate cancer.

Unlike previous real-time image guidance methods, KIM uses a standard linear accelerator without any additional equipment needed. The first prospective clinical trial of KIM is underway for prostate cancer radiation therapy. In this paper we report on the measured motion accuracy and precision using real-time KIM-guided gating.  Methods and materials:   Imaging and motion information from the first 200 fractions from 6 patient prostate cancer radiation therapy volumetric modulated arc therapy treatments were analyzed. A 3-mm/5-second action threshold was used to trigger a gating event where the beam is paused and the couch position adjusted to realign the prostate to the treatment isocenter. To quantify the in vivo accuracy and precision, KIM was compared with simultaneously acquired kV/MV triangulation for 187 fractions.  Results:   KIM was successfully used in 197 of 200 fractions. Gating events occurred in 29 fractions (14.5%). In these 29 fractions, the percentage of beam-on time, the prostate displacement was >3 mm from the isocenter position, reduced from 73% without KIM to 24% with KIM-guided gating. Displacements >5 mm were reduced from 16% without KIM to 0% with KIM. The KIM accuracy was measured at <0.3 mm in all 3 dimensions. The KIM precision was <0.6 mm in all 3 dimensions.

Objective:   To compare mortality rates in patients receiving ET alone versus ET + RAD.  Design, settings, and participants:   From 1996 to 2002, 875 Scandinavian patients with high-risk (90%) or intermediate PCa were randomized to ET or ET + RAD (The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7). After 3 mo with total androgen blockade in all patients, all individuals continued lifelong antiandrogen monotherapy. Those randomized to ET + RAD started prostate radiotherapy (70Gy) at 3 mo.  Outcome, measurements and statistical analysis:   PCa-specific 15-yr mortality represented the primary endpoint. Assessment of the combination treatment effect and prognostic factors was performed in competing risk analyses and Cox proportional-hazard models.  Intervention:   RAD added to ET.  Results and limitations:   With a median observation time of 12 yr, the 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates were 34% (95% confidence interval, 29-39%) and 17% (95% confidence interval, 13-22%) in the ET and ET + RAD arms respectively (p<0.001). Compared with the ET arm, the median overall survival in the ET + RAD arm was prolonged by 2.4 yr. Treatment with ET alone, age ≥65 yr and increasing histology grade independently increased the risk of PCa-specific and overall mortality. Limitations include nonformal evaluation of comorbidity, the inability to calculate progression-free survival, and lack of information about salvage therapy and toxicity.  Conclusions:   In patients with nonmetastatic locally advanced or aggressive PCa, ET + RAD reduces the absolute risk of PCa-specific death by 17% at 15 yr compared with ET alone; the comparable 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates being 17% and 34%. The results warrant a phase 3 study comparing ET + RAD with radical prostatectomy in high-risk PCa.

However, the results are conflicting, perhaps because prostate cancer is a very heterogeneous disease. More recent studies have focused on cancer progression and mortality. Vitamin D is closely related to both calcium metabolism and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and all three factors have been implicated in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We examined the associations between pre-diagnostic serum levels of vitamin D (25OHD), PTH, and calcium and mortality among 943 participants within the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, who were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The mean time from diagnosis until the end of followup was 9.1 years (SD 4.5), and the mean time from inclusion until end of follow-up was 16.6 years (SD 4.9). The analytes were divided into quartiles, and the risk of death from prostate cancer was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard analysis, yielding hazards ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals. The models were adjusted for season and year of inclusion, age at baseline, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), and tumor characteristics (TNM and Gleason score).  Results:   We observed a trend toward a lower prostate-specific mortality with 25OHD >85 nmol/L in the unadjusted analysis. This became statistically significantly in the third quartile of 25OHD (85-102 nmol/L) compared to the first (<68 nmol/L), HR 0.54 (0.34-0.85) when adjusting for age, time of inclusion, and BMI. The association was further strengthened when adjusted for age at diagnosis, Gleason score, and TNM classification with a HR in Q3 0.36 (0.22-0.60). p for trend was 0.03. Regarding calcium, there was a significantly lower HR for the second quartile (2.35-2.39 mmol/L) compared to the first (≤2.34 mmol/L) with a HR of 0.54 (0.32-0.86) in the unadjusted analysis. However, this association disappeared when adjusting for tumor characteristics. There were no associations between levels of PTH and prostate cancer mortality.

Apatorsen (OGX-427) is a 2'-methoxyethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits Hsp27 expression. This study evaluated the safety profile and recommended phase II dosing of apatorsen in patients with advanced cancer.  Patients and methods:   Patients with castration-resistant prostate (CRPC), breast, ovary, lung, or bladder cancer were enrolled to this phase I dose-escalation study. Apatorsen was administered i.v. weekly in 21-day cycles following 3 loading doses and over 5 dose levels (200-1000 mg). Apatorsen plasma concentrations, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC Hsp27 expression, and serum Hsp27 levels were evaluated.  Results:   Forty-two patients were accrued, of which 52% had CRPC. Patients were heavily pretreated, with 57% having had ≥3 prior chemotherapy regimens. During the loading dose/cycle 1 and overall study period, 93% and 100% of patients (N = 42) experienced treatment-related adverse events, respectively; most were grade 1-2 and included chills, pruritus, flushing, prolonged aPTT, lymphopenia, and anemia. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity at the 600 mg dose level (intracranial hemorrhage in a previously undiagnosed brain metastasis). A maximum tolerated dose was not defined. Apatorsen Cmax increased proportionally with dose. Decreases in tumor markers and declines in CTCs were observed, with a prostate-specific antigen decline >%50% occurring in 10% of patients with CRPC; 29/39 assessable patients (74%) had reductions from ≥5 CTC/7.5 ml at baseline to <5 CTC/7.5 ml post-treatment. Twelve patients had stable measurable disease as best response.  Conclusions:   Apatorsen was tolerated at the highest dose evaluated (1000 mg).

Straining was rated on a six-point scale (straining score) according to frequency of straining using answers to question 6 of the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after prostatectomy. Straining scores were compared between patients with and without postoperative inguinal hernia. Multivariate analysis was carried out to identify parameters associated with inguinal hernia development after prostatectomy. Associations between inguinal hernia development and frequency of postoperative urinary straining were also estimated.  Results:   Straining score in both groups was significantly increased at 1 month after radical retropubic prostatectomy. This increase was significantly greater in the postoperative inguinal hernia group (P < 0.05). Throughout the observation period, postoperative straining scores were higher in the group with postoperative inguinal hernia than in the group without. On multivariate analysis, postoperative urinary straining and previous hernia repair represented significant risk factors for postoperative inguinal hernia. The proportion of patients without inguinal hernia decreased significantly with increasing frequency of postoperative urinary straining.  Conclusion:   Urinary straining is associated with inguinal hernia development after radical retropubic prostatectomy.""","""['Yasuhiro Kaiho', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Shigeyuki Yamada', 'Hideo Saito', 'Hisanobu Adachi', 'Shinichi Yamashita', 'Hideaki Izumi', 'Akihiro Ito', 'Yoichi Arai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Post-radical retropubic prostatectomy inguinal hernia: an analysis of risk factors with special reference to preoperative inguinal hernia morbidity and pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Inguinal hernia after radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a study of incidence and risk factors in comparison to no operation and lymphadenectomy.', 'Frequency of postoperative inguinal hernia after endoscope-assisted mini-laparotomy and conventional retropubic radical prostatectomies.', 'Risk factors and prevention of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Tips for operation of inguinal hernia after implantation of artificial urinary sphincter following radical prostatectomy: report of two cases.', 'The cumulative incidence and risk factors of postoperative inguinal hernia in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Causative factors for de novo inguinal hernia after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor administered immediately after radical prostatectomy temporarily increases the need for incontinence pads, but improves final continence status.']"""

Methods:   Prostate cancer-specific health states were developed with attributes that varied across five health domains: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, pain, and fear of the future. Men with prostate cancer, men at risk for prostate cancer, and a sample of the general population assigned value to 18 disease-specific health states using standard gamble (SG) methodology. Study participants also completed the Health Utilities Index (HUI) to obtain generic, community-based preference values to capture their current health rating.  Results:   A total of 136 participants were enrolled (n = 43 prostate cancer; n = 40 at risk for prostate cancer; n = 49 general population). Mean HUI mark 3 current health ratings: men with prostate cancer 0.75 ± 0.260; men at risk for prostate cancer 0.77 ± 0.238; general population 0.84 ± 0.178. Mean SG preference values ranged from 0.46 to 0.85 among men with prostate cancer, 0.37 to 0.75 among men at risk for prostate cancer, and 0.32 to 0.81 among the general population group.  Conclusions:   In general, preference values for disease-specific health states using the patient perspective were higher than those for the general population. Generic preference values calculated from the HUI were higher than disease-specific preference values calculated from the SG.

Nevertheless, because the specificity of the PSA test for cancer detection is low, it leads to many negative biopsies. The Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (PHI) testing demonstrates improved specificity compared with the PSA-only screening and therefore may improve the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer detection.  Objective:   To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding PHI testing to improve cancer detection for men with elevated serum PSA.  Methods:   A microsimulation model, based on the results of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer trial, was used to evaluate the effects of PSA screening and PHI reflex testing. We predicted the numbers of prostate cancers, negative biopsies, deaths, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost-effectiveness of both PSA (cutoff 3 ng/mL) and PHI (cutoff 25) testing methods for a European population, screened from age 50 to 75 years at 4-year intervals.  Results:   When the PHI test was added to the PSA screening, for men with a PSA between 3 and 10 ng/mL, the model predicted a 23% reduction in negative biopsies. This would lead to a 17% reduction in costs for diagnostics and 1% reduction in total costs for prostate cancer. The cost-effectiveness (3.5% discounted) was 11% better. Limitations found were the modeling assumptions on the sensitivity and specificity of PHI by tumor stage and cutoff values.

Evidence is increasing that improved protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) participates in therapy resistance of chronically hypoxic cancer cells. We aimed at characterizing the relevance of improved ROS defense for radiation resistance of cancer cells with tolerance to cycling anoxia/re-oxygenation stress (""anoxia-tolerant"") and at designing rational treatment strategies for overcoming the resulting therapy resistance by targeting the underlying mechanisms identified in an in vitro model.  Results:   We demonstrate that chronic exposure of NCH-H460 lung adenocarcinoma, DU145 prostate cancer, and T98G glioblastoma cells to cycling anoxia/re-oxygenation stress induced upregulation of the aspartate-aminotransferase glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT1), particularly in RAS-driven anoxia-tolerant NCI-H460 cells. Altered glutamine utilization of the anoxia-tolerant cancer cells contributed to the observed decrease in cellular ROS levels, the increase in cellular glutathione levels, and improved cell survival on ROS-inducing treatments, including exposure to ionizing radiation. Importantly, targeting glutamine-dependent antioxidant capacity or glutathione metabolism allowed us to hit anoxia-tolerant cancer cells and to overcome their increased resistance to radiation-induced cell death. Targeting glutathione metabolism by Piperlongumine also improved the radiation response of anoxia-tolerant NCI-H460 cells in vivo.  Innovation:   Improved antioxidant capacity downstream of up-regulated GOT1-expression is a characteristic of anoxia-tolerant cancer cells and is predictive for a specific vulnerability to inhibition of glutamine utilization or glutathione metabolism, respectively.  Conclusion:   Unraveling the molecular alterations underlying improved ROS defense of anoxia-tolerant cancer cells allows the design of rational strategies for overcoming radiation resistance caused by tumor cell heterogeneity in hypoxic tumors.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), in particular, is known to be altered in carcinogenesis, leading to an increase in the production of reactive oxidative species and glycolysis, one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Because of this, genetic variation in the mitochondrial genome, which encodes for part of the OXPHOS pathway, has been suggested to play a role in many cancers, including prostate cancer.  Methods:   We comprehensively examined the role of the mitochondrial genome and prostate cancer risk in 4,086 prostate cancer cases and 3,698 controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), testing 350 mitochondrial SNPs (mtSNPs) in five racial/ethnic populations-Africans, Asian Americans, Europeans, Latinos, and Native Hawaiians. Logistic regression was conducted to examine single mitochondrial SNP and haplogroup associations. The sequence kernel association test was conducted for gene and pathway analysis.  Results:   Eleven mtSNPs and haplogroup N were nominally associated with overall prostate cancer risk at P < 0.05. The mitochondrial DNA-encoded OXPHOS pathway, complexes, and genes were not associated with prostate cancer risk. No significant associations were identified after multiple testing corrections (all FDR q > 0.20).  Conclusions:   The mitochondrial genome was not associated with prostate cancer risk in our study of 7,784 subjects from the MEC.

Patients and methods:   Eligible patients had PSA levels assessed at baseline, and monthly during enzalutamide treatment. Early PSA increase was defined as an increased PSA level at 4 weeks ≥20 % (PSA + 20w4) from baseline. Early PSA decline was defined as a PSA response at 4 weeks ≥30 % (PSA30w4) and ≥50 % (PSA50w4) from baseline.

The impact of early PSA increase and decline on PFS and OS was evaluated by Cox regression analyses.  Results:   We assessed 193 patients with median age of 73 years (range 43-91 years).

Challenging herein is the identification of the minimum dose at which the tracer can be detected with a clinical-grade fluorescence camera. Using a hybrid tracer such as indocyanine green (ICG)-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid, it has become possible to determine the accumulation of tracer and correlate this to intraoperative fluorescence-based identification rates. In the current study, we determined the lower detection limit of tracer at which intraoperative fluorescence guidance was still feasible.  Methods:   Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) provided a laboratory set-up to analyze the chemical content and to simulate the migratory behavior of ICG-nanocolloid in tissue. Tracer accumulation and intraoperative fluorescence detection findings were derived from a retrospective analysis of 20 head-and-neck melanoma patients, 40 penile and 20 prostate cancer patients scheduled for sentinel node (SN) biopsy using ICG-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid. In these patients, following tracer injection, single photon emission computed tomography fused with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was used to identify the SN(s). The percentage injected dose (% ID), the amount of ICG (in nmol), and the concentration of ICG in the SNs (in μM) was assessed for SNs detected on SPECT/CT and correlated with the intraoperative fluorescence imaging findings.  Results:   SEC determined that in the hybrid tracer formulation, 41 % (standard deviation: 12 %) of ICG was present in nanocolloid-bound form. In the SNs detected using fluorescence guidance a median of 0.88 % ID was present, compared to a median of 0.25 % ID in the non-fluorescent SNs (p-value < 0.001). The % ID values could be correlated to the amount ICG in a SN (range: 0.003-10.8 nmol) and the concentration of ICG in a SN (range: 0.006-64.6 μM).  Discussion:   The ability to provide intraoperative fluorescence guidance is dependent on the amount and concentration of the fluorescent dye accumulated in the lesion(s) of interest. Our findings indicate that intraoperative fluorescence detection with ICG is possible above a μM concentration.""","""['Gijs H KleinJan', 'Anton Bunschoten', 'Nynke S van den Berg', 'Renato A Valdès Olmos', 'W Martin C Klop', 'Simon Horenblas', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy: A First Step Towards a Fluorescence-based Anatomic Roadmap.', 'Hybrid Indocyanine Green-99mTc-nanocolloid for Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography and Combined Radio- and Fluorescence-guided Sentinel Node Biopsy in Penile Cancer: Results of 740 Inguinal Basins Assessed at a Single Institution.', 'A hybrid radioactive and fluorescent tracer for sentinel node biopsy in penile carcinoma as a potential replacement for blue dye.', 'Sentinel node in melanoma and breast cancer.

The reasons for observed differences in stage at diagnosis between AI/ANs and non-Hispanic whites remain unclear.  Methods:   Medicaid, Indian Health Service Care Systems, and state cancer registry data for California, Oregon, and Washington (2001-2008, analyzed in 2014-2015) were linked to identify AI/ANs and non-Hispanic whites diagnosed with invasive breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for distant disease versus local or regional disease, in AI/ANs compared with non-Hispanic white case patients.  Results:   A similar proportion of AI/AN (31.2%) and non-Hispanic white (35.5%) patients were diagnosed with distant-stage cancer in this population (AOR=1.03, 95% CI=0.88, 1.20). No significant differences in stage at diagnosis were found for any individual cancer site. Among AI/ANs, Indian Health Service Care Systems eligibility was not associated with stage at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In contrast to the general population of the U.S., among Medicaid enrollees, AI/AN race is not associated with later stage at diagnosis. Cancer survival disparities associated with AI/AN race that have been observed in the broader population may be driven by factors associated with income and health insurance that are also associated with race, as income and insurance status are more homogenous within the Medicaid population than within the broader population.""","""['Scott V Adams', 'Andrea N Burnett-Hartman', 'Andrew Karnopp', 'Aasthaa Bansal', 'Stacey A Cohen', 'Victoria Warren-Mears', 'Scott D Ramsey']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Prev Med""","""['Evaluating disparities in inpatient surgical cancer care among American Indian/Alaska Native patients.', 'Cancer-Directed Therapy and Hospice Care for Metastatic Cancer in American Indians and Alaska Natives.', 'Prevalence and Disparities in Tobacco Product Use Among American Indians/Alaska Natives - United States, 2010-2015.', 'Use of endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer among American Indians and Alaska natives.', 'Stroke in American Indians and Alaska Natives: A Systematic Review.', 'Association Between Patient-Level, Clinic-Level, and Geographical-Level Factors and 1-Year Surveillance Colonoscopy Adherence.', 'Racial Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Mortality: the Role of Endoscopy Wait-Time and Stage at Diagnosis.', 'Effect Modification of the Association Between Race and Stage at Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis by Socioeconomic Status.', 'Impact of Health Insurance on Stage at Cancer Diagnosis Among Adolescents and Young Adults.']"""

Methods and materials:   Group 1 (n=20) patients were treated before the trial inception with the standard dose prescription. Each patient had an additional treatment plan generated per the experimental arm. A total of 40 treatment plans were compared (20 plans for each technique). Group 2 (n=15) consists of patients currently accrued to the hypofractionated external beam image guided highly targeted radiation therapy trial. Plans were created as per the treatment arm, with additional plans for 5 of the group 2 experimental arm with a 3-mm expansion in the imaging GTV.  Results:   For all plans in both patient groups, planning target volume coverage ranged from 95% to 100%; GTV coverage of 89.3 Gy for the experimental treatment plans ranged from 95.2% to 99.8%. For both groups 1 and 2, the percent volumes of rectum/anus and bladder receiving 40 Gy, 65 Gy, and 80 Gy were smaller in the experimental plans than in the standard plans. The percent volume at 1 Gy per fraction and 1.625 Gy per fraction were compared between the standard and the experimental arms, and these were found to be equivalent.

Here we show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-γ antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity, in mice.

In the present study, gartanin, an isoprentylated xanthone in the mangosteen fruit, was evaluated for enhancing AR degradation, and inducing the unfolded protein response pathway.  Methods and results:   The interaction of gartanin with the ligand-binding domain was characterized using a fluorescence polarization cell-free assay and cell-based FRET assay. Western blot analysis identified modulation of ER stress markers (BiP, PERK, IRE1, and CHOP) along with androgen receptor degradation. A computation simulation was performed to identify possible orientations of gartanin with the ligand-binding domain. Utilizing a cell-free and cell-based FRET assays gartanin was found to interact with the ligand-binding domain through a solely antagonist interaction. Interestingly, inhibition of CHOP, a critical component of the ER stress pathway, was observed to stabilize AR.

Methods:   Semi-structured interviews conducted from the US by phone and in-person were used to explore and characterize the: 1) experience of cognitive and neurobehavioral functioning in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT (n = 19) compared with patients who had not undergone ADT (n = 20); 2) perceived causes of cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms; 3) impact of these symptoms on quality of life; and 4) strategies used to cope with or compensate for these symptoms. Neuropsychological performance was assessed to characterize the sample.  Results:   Overall, ADT patients experienced marginally more cognitive problems than non-ADT (nADT) patients even though there were no significant differences between groups in neuropsychological performance. ADT patients also experienced more declines in prospective memory and multi-tasking than nADT patients. Significant proportions of participants in both groups also experienced retrospective memory, attention and concentration, and information processing difficulties. With respect to neurobehavioral symptoms, more ADT patients experienced emotional lability and impulsivity (both aspects of disinhibition) than nADT patients. Among the causes to which participants attributed declines, both groups attributed them primarily to aging. A majority of ADT patients also attributed declines to ADT. For both groups, increased cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms negatively impacted quality of life, and most participants developed strategies to ameliorate these problems.  Conclusion:   ADT patients are more vulnerable to experiencing specific cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms than nADT patients. This study highlights the importance of capturing: a) cognitive symptoms not easily detected using neuropsychological tests; b) neurobehavioral symptoms that can be confused with psychological symptoms, and c) causal beliefs that may affect how people cope with these symptoms.

Nevertheless, inhibition of mTOR is ineffective in inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, likely because of the compensatory up-regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway.  Methods:   Patients who were eligible for this study had to have progressive CRPC with serum testosterone levels <50 ng/dL. No prior bicalutamide (except to prevent flare) or everolimus was allowed. Treatment included oral bicalutamide 50 mg and oral everolimus 10 mg, both once daily, with a cycle defined as 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥30% reduction) from baseline. A sample size of 23 patients would have power of 0.8 and an α error of .05 (1-sided) if the combination had a PSA response rate of 50% versus a historic rate of 25% with bicalutamide alone.  Results:   Twenty-four patients were enrolled. The mean age was 71.1 years (range, 53.0-87.0 years), the mean PSA level at study entry was 43.4 ng/dL (range, 2.5-556.9 ng/dL), and the mean length of treatment was 8 cycles (range, 1.0-23.0 cycles). Of 24 patients, 18 had a PSA response (75%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.90), whereas 15 (62.5%; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81) had a PSA decrease ≥50%. The median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI, 14.1-42.7 months). Fourteen patients (54%; 95% CI, 0.37-0.78) developed grade 3 (13 patients) or grade 4 (1 patient with sepsis) adverse events that were attributable to treatment.

For patients with advanced castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) treatment options are limited and overall survival is relatively short. Paired with this, non-invasive diagnostic options are yet to be established. Activins are members of the TGF-β superfamily and have been linked to prostate physiology. For instance, activin A is an inhibitor of growth in the prostate. A novel class of non-coding RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been intrinsically linked to a range of cellular processes and carcinogenesis. No studies have investigated the impact of activin A on miRNA expression in PCa cell lines. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of activin A on miRNA expression and downstream target genes in PCa.  Methods:   Activin-sensitive (LNCaP) and insensitive (PC3) prostate cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of activin A for 72 hr. To examine miRNA expression following treatment, SYBR RT-qPCR miRNA arrays were used in conjunction with TaqMan RT-qPCR. MiRPath-TarBase analysis was conducted using the miRNAs that were significantly altered following activin A treatment of LNCaP cells to highlight enriched target genes within biological pathways. Highlighted target genes were assessed using pathway-focused TGF-β and cell cycle SYBR RT-qPCR arrays.  Results:   Activin A treatment altered nine miRNAs in LNCaP cells: miR-222-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-18a-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly decreased, while miR-30a/30d-5p, let-7c, and miR-196b-5p were significantly increased versus media control. In PC3 cells five miRNAs were altered: miR-130a-3p, miR-7-5p, and miR-140-3p were significantly decreased while miR-191-5p and miR-26a-5p were significantly increased versus media control. MiRPath-TarBase analysis highlighted that the miRNAs significantly altered in LNCaP cells targeted genes contained in activin A-related KEGG pathways. Furthermore, when LNCaP cells were treated with activin A the expression of the targeted genes was the inverse of the expression of activin A-mediated miRNAs.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the ability of activin A to modulate miRNA expression in PCa cell lines and suggests a correlative relationship between miRNA expression and downstream target genes in LNCaP cells.

Detection of those changes can be useful as disease biomarkers. As a result of these modifications, size and/or electrical charge of the glycoprotein can be altered. Migration in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is governed by the size to charge ratio of the analyte and therefore this separation technique can be used to monitor those modifications. At its turn, the alteration of the electrophoretical pattern of a given glycoprotein could be used as disease biomarker. To this aim, high repeatability for separation of a large number of peaks for a given glycoprotein is desirable. For prostate cancer, new markers are needed to decrease the high number of false positive results provided by the biomarkers currently used in clinics. In this sense, CZE methods for analysis of the several prostate specific antigen (PSA) peaks which this glycoprotein exhibit, called isoforms and containing one or more glycoforms, could be useful to study the PSA pattern as prostate cancer marker. In this study two complementary strategies to achieve both lot-to-lot capillary repeatability and high resolution of a large number of PSA isoforms are developed. Better performance and precision have been obtained for capillaries conditioned with HCl than for those conditioned with NaOH. Optimization of the background electrolyte (BGE) pH value to 8.0 and inclusion of 3M urea on its composition were the two factors of highest impact for enhancing resolution of the highest number of PSA peaks. Under the optimized conditions for capillary conditioning and BGE pH and composition, long-term resolution of 10 isoforms of PSA was achieved. Inter-day (n=3) %RSD was 0.55 for the ratio tm/tEOF, 1.15 for μeff, and 5.02 for % Acorr of the PSA peaks.""","""['Noemi Farina-Gomez', 'Angel Puerta', 'Monica Gonzalez', 'Jose Carlos Diez-Masa', 'Mercedes de Frutos']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Chromatogr A""","""['Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).', 'Sample preparation of serum to allow capillary electrophoresis analysis of prostate specific antigen isoforms.', 'On-capillary fluorescent labeling and capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence analysis of glycoforms of intact prostate-specific antigen.', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Isoforms of free prostate-specific antigen.', 'Recent Trends in Electrochemical Sensors for Vital Biomedical Markers Using Hybrid Nanostructured Materials.', 'Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).']"""

Methods:   This was a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled PREVAIL trial. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing on androgen deprivation therapy were randomized one-to-one to 160 mg/day oral enzalutamide or placebo until discontinuation on radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy. Coprimary end-points were centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary end-points were investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to prostate-specific antigen progression, prostate-specific antigen response (≥50% decline) and time to skeletal-related event.  Results:   Of 1717 patients, 61 were enrolled in Japan (enzalutamide, n = 28; placebo, n = 33); hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 0.30 for centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (0.03-2.95), 0.59 for overall survival (0.20-1.8), 0.46 for time to chemotherapy (0.22-0.96) and 0.36 for time to prostate-specific antigen progression (0.17-0.75) showed the treatment benefit of enzalutamide over the placebo. Prostate-specific antigen responses were observed in 60.7% of enzalutamide-treated men versus 21.2% of placebo-treated men. Plasma concentrations of enzalutamide were higher in Japanese patients: the geometric mean ratio of Japanese/non-Japanese patients was 1.126 (90% confidence interval 1.018-1.245) at 13 weeks.

Methods:   Clinicopathologic analysis based on the status of HGPIN was performed in 388 patients who received radical prostatectomy between January 2005 and December 2008 in Severance Hospital. Among them, 10 paired HGPIN and PCa were prepared to perform miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR. Fifty-two prostatectomy specimens were used to further validation of protein expression that was assessed by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in matched non-neoplastic prostatic tissue (NPT), HGPIN, and PCa. Functional analysis was performed using a prostate normal cell line (RWPE-1) and two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3) for comparison of expression of miR-155 and STAT3 mRNA before and after treatment of miR-155 mimetics/antagomir into each cell line.  Results:   Patients with HGPIN had significantly less lymphovascular invasion, less lymph node metastasis, lower tumor volume, lower Gleason score, lower incidence of death, and longer overall survival compared to patients without HGPIN. MiR-155, miR-210, miR-153, and miR-200c were downregulated in HGPIN and PCa in common, compared to NPT. As putative target mRNAs, mRNA expression level of STAT3, ZEB1, and BACH1 was increased in PCa and HGPIN compared to NPT. mRNA expression level of ephrin-A3 was increased in PCa compared to NPT, and FGFRL1 was decreased in PCa compared to HGPIN and NPT. Protein expression assessed by IHC showed correlated results in STAT3, ZEB1, and ephrin-A3. Moreover, STAT3 and ZEB1 increased in a stepwise manner, from NPT to PCa. Treatment of miR-155 antagomir increased STAT3 mRNA expression in RWPE-1 cells, whereas treatment of miR-155 mimetics into PC-3 cells significantly decreased STAT3 expression.  Conclusions:   STAT3 and ZEB1 could be the key molecules altered at the early stages of carcinogenesis, especially in HGPIN.

As a minimally invasive approach performed under TRUS guidance, brachytherapy is an appealing framework for focal therapy. However, the contrast in TRUS images is generally insufficient to distinguish the target lesion from normal prostate tissue. MRI usually offers a much better contrast between the lesion and surrounding tissues. Registration between TRUS and MRI may therefore significantly improve lesion targeting capability in focal prostate brachytherapy. In this paper, we present a deformable registration framework for the accurate fusion of TRUS and MRI prostate volumes under large deformations arising from dissimilarities in diameter, shape and orientation between endorectal coils and TRUS probes.  Methods:   Following pose correction by a RANSAC implementation of the ICP algorithm, TRUS and MRI Prostate contour points are represented by a 3D extension of the shape-context descriptor and matched by the Hungarian algorithm. Eventually, a smooth free-form warping is computed by fitting a 3D B-spline mesh to the set of matched points.  Results:   Quantitative validation of the registration accuracy is provided on a retrospective set of ten real cases, using as landmarks either brachytherapy seeds (six cases) or external beam radiotherapy fiducials (four cases) implanted and visible in both modalities. The average registration error between the landmarks was 2.49 and 3.20 mm, for the brachytherapy and external beam sets, respectively, that is less than the MRI voxels' long axis length ([Formula: see text]). The overall average registration error (for brachytherapy and external beam datasets together) was 2.56 mm.

We aimed to evaluate associations between glucose, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and survival among individuals with diabetes and diabetes associated cancers.  Methods:   Five retrospective cohort studies were conducted in a large population-representative database. The study population included all patients with diabetes and an incident diagnosis of colorectal, breast, bladder, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Exposure of interest was serum glucose or HbA1C levels within 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis. Cox regression model was used to calculate hazard-ratio (HR) and 95% confidence-interval (CI) for overall survival. Analyses were adjusted for cancer-specific confounders. A subgroup analysis was performed among insulin-treated patients.  Results:   Study cohorts included 7916 individuals with incident cancers and concurrent diabetes. There was no association between HbA1C levels and overall survival in colorectal (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.06), breast (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95-1.11), bladder (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.01), pancreatic (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.02), or prostate (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.08) cancers. Among diabetes patients treated with insulin, there was increased survival with increasing serum glucose, most prominent for bladder cancer (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99, per 1 mmol/l increase).
