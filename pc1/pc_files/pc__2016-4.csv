This study examined the interdependent relationships between their appraisals of illness and QOL and if their perceived dyadic communication mediated these relationships.  Methods:   We used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model (APIMeM) approach to conduct a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from 124 prostate cancer patient-spouse dyads. We examined actor effects (each person's influence on his/her own outcomes) and partner effects (each person's influence on his/her partner's outcomes). Appraisals of illness, perceived dyadic communication, and QOL were measured using Appraisal of Illness Scale, Lewis Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity Scale, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy General Scale, respectively. Analyses controlled for effects of prostate cancer symptoms and demographic factors.  Results:   Among actor effects, spouses with more negative appraisals at baseline perceived worse dyadic communication 4 months later (p < .05) and worse QOL 8 months later (p < .001). Patients and spouses who perceived more dyadic communication at 4 months had better QOL at 8 months (p < .01). Among partner effects, there was only weak evidence for an association between patient perceived dyadic communication at 4 months and better spouse QOL at 8 months of follow-up (p = .05). No mediation effects were found.  Conclusions:   Patients' and spouses' appraisals of the illness and their dyadic communication were associated with their long-term QOL. Interventions that reduce negative appraisals of illness and promote dyadic communication may improve QOL for both patients with prostate cancer and their spouses.""","""['Lixin Song', 'Christine Rini', 'Katrina R Ellis', 'Laurel L Northouse']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Illness uncertainty, partner support, and quality of life: A dyadic longitudinal investigation of couples facing prostate cancer.', 'The effect of depression on quality of life in infertile couples: an actor-partner interdependence model approach.', 'The effects of depressive symptoms and anxiety on quality of life in patients with heart failure and their spouses: testing dyadic dynamics using Actor-Partner Interdependence Model.', 'A literature review of the relationship between dyadic coping and dyadic outcomes in cancer couples.', 'Dyadic coping and relationship functioning in couples coping with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Perceived financial burden is indirectly linked to sexual well-being via quality of life among couples seeking medically assisted reproduction.', 'Patient-caregiver communication concordance in cancer-refinement of the Cancer Communication Assessment Tool in an Australian sample.', 'Emotional distress in neuro-ICU survivor-caregiver dyads: The recovering together randomized clinical trial.', 'Relationship communication and the course of psychological outcomes among couples coping with localised prostate cancer.', 'Illness Uncertainty and Its Antecedents for Patients With Prostate Cancer and Their Partners.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients presenting for prostate biopsy with regions of interest on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging underwent magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy. For each region of interest 2 visually targeted cores were obtained, followed by 2 cores using a magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion device. Our primary end point was the difference in the detection of high grade (Gleason 7 or greater) and any grade cancer between visually targeted and magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion, investigated using McNemar's method. Secondary end points were the difference in detection rate by biopsy location using a logistic regression model and the difference in median cancer length using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   We identified 396 regions of interest in 286 men. The difference in the detection of high grade cancer between magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy and visually targeted biopsy was -1.4% (95% CI -6.4 to 3.6, p=0.6) and for any grade cancer the difference was 3.5% (95% CI -1.9 to 8.9, p=0.2). Median cancer length detected by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion and visually targeted biopsy was 5.5 vs 5.8 mm, respectively (p=0.8). Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy detected 15% more cancers in the transition zone (p=0.046) and visually targeted biopsy detected 11% more high grade cancer at the prostate base (p=0.005). Only 52% of all high grade cancers were detected by both techniques.  Conclusions:   We found no evidence of a significant difference in the detection of high grade or any grade cancer between visually targeted and magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy. However, the performance of each technique varied in specific biopsy locations and the outcomes of both techniques were complementary. Combining visually targeted biopsy and magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy may optimize the detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Daniel J Lee', 'Pedro Recabal', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Alan Thong', 'Justin K Lee', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas', 'Jonathan Coleman', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostatakarzinom: 2 Techniken zur Biopsieentnahme im Vergleich.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy Improves but Does Not Replace Standard Template Biopsy for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'MR Imaging-Targeted Prostate Biopsies.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Impact of Ultrasonographic Findings on Cancer Detection Rate during Magnetic Resonance Image/Ultrasonography Fusion-Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'Selecting patients for magnetic resonance imaging cognitive versus ultrasound fusion biopsy of the prostate: A within-patient comparison.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Paradigm Shift in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Pre-Biopsy Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Targeted Biopsy.']"""

Methods:   A decision tree model (TreeAge Pro) was used to compare the strategy of pretherapy placement of a spacing hydrogel before RT to RT alone. The model compared costs associated with rectal complications because of rectal toxicity over a 10-year period across 3 different RT modalities. Rectal toxicity rates were estimated from studies on conformal RT dose escalation, high-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and low-dose SBRT. Rectal toxicity reduction rates (baseline reduction 70%) were estimated from recently published 15 month data using a rectal spacer. Direct and indirect cost estimates for established grades of rectal toxicity were based on national and institutional costs. Reduction in short-term complications were assumed to carry forward to a reduction in long-term toxicity. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   The overall standard management cost for conformal RT was $3,428 vs. $3,946 with rectal spacer for an incremental cost of $518 over 10 years. A 1-way sensitivity analyses showed the breakeven cost of spacer at $2,332 or a breakeven overall risk reduction of 86% at a cost of $2,850. For high-dose SBRT, spacer was immediately cost effective with a savings of $2,640 and breakeven risk reduction at 36%. However, 2-way spacer cost to risk reduction sensitivity analyses were performed.  Conclusion:   The use of a rectal spacer for conformal RT results in a marginal cost increase with a significant reduction in rectal toxicity assuming recently published 15 month rectal toxicity reduction is maintained over 10 years. For high-dose SBRT it was cost effective. Further studies would be necessary to validate the long-term benefits of rectal spacers.""","""['Ryan C Hutchinson', 'Varun Sundaram', 'Michael Folkert', 'Yair Lotan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Hydrogel Rectal Spacer in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'SpaceOAR hydrogel spacer injection prior to stereotactic body radiation therapy for men with localized prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy with periprostatic hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer: toxicity profile and early oncologic outcomes.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'MRI findings of absorbable hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer therapy: a pictorial review.', 'The case of the missing spacer!', 'Hyaluronic acid spacer in prostate cancer radiotherapy: dosimetric effects, spacer stability and long-term toxicity and PRO in a phase II study.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Delphi study to identify consensus on patient selection for hydrogel rectal spacer use during radiation therapy for prostate cancer in the UK.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Additionally, we aimed to determine a cut-off uptake value for differentiation of primary tumours from normal prostate tissue.  Procedures:   Overall, [(68)Ga]PSMA positron emission tomography/x-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) of 101 patients (mean age 69.1 years) with PCA was analysed retrospectively. For assessment of tracer biodistribution, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were calculated for various normal organs, as well as for primary tumours (PT) and/or metastases. Results are presented as median, interquartile range (IQR; 25th quantil-75th quantil) and range (minimum-maximum).  Results:   [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT was performed 50 min (range 30-126) after injection of 109 MBq (range 84-158). Regarding biodistribution, highest uptake (median/IQR/range) of the tracer was found in the kidneys (49.6/40.7-57.6/2.7-97.0) followed by the submandibular glands (17.3/13.7-21.2/7.5-30.4), parotid glands (16.1/12.2-19.8/5.5-30.9) and duodenum (13.8/10.5-17.2/5.8-26.9). The best cut-off value for differentiating physiological uptake in the primary tumour from that in the prostate was found to be an SUVmax of 3.2. The median SUVmax in the PT (n = 35), locally recurrent PCA (n = 8), lymph node (n = 166), bone (n = 157) and other metastases (n = 3) were 10.2, 5.9, 6.2, 7.4 and 3.8, respectively. The best cut-off values for differentiating non-pathological uptake in lymph nodes and bones from tumour uptake were found to be SUVmax of 3.2 and 1.9, respectively. Patients with PSA <2 had significantly lower SUVmax in bone metastases as compared to patients with PSA ≥2 (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   This biodistribution study provided a broad range of uptake data of [(68)Ga]PSMA-11 for normal organs/tissues, primary prostate tumours and metastatic lesions based on a large patient cohort. Both PT and small metastatic lesions were detectable due to their high tracer uptake. Four-times-higher median uptake in PT in comparison to normal prostate stroma resulted in a high diagnostic accuracy that could potentially be used for multimodal image-guided biopsy with dedicated reconstruction software.""","""['Vikas Prasad', 'Ingo G Steffen', 'Gerd Diederichs', 'Marcus R Makowski', 'Peter Wust', 'Winfried Brenner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in primary staging of prostate cancer: PSA and Gleason score predict the intensity of tracer accumulation in the primary tumour.', 'PSA levels, PSA doubling time, Gleason score and prior therapy cannot predict measured uptake of 68GaPSMA-HBED-CC lesion uptake in recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'PSMA PET imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA Radioligand Uptake as a Biomarker of Neoangiogenesis in Solid Tumours: Diagnostic or Theragnostic Factor?', 'PSMA PET Imaging and Therapy in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma and Other Salivary Gland Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'The Value of Multimodality PET/CT Imaging in Detecting Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Establishment and prospective validation of an SUVmax cutoff value to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer from benign prostate diseases in patients with suspected prostate cancer by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: a real-world study.']"""

Information on antiepileptic drug purchases was obtained from the national prescription reimbursement database. Odds ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis. Compared to never-users of antiepileptic drugs, the overall prostate cancer risk was decreased among users of phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproic acid (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.47, 95 % CI 0.24-0.92; OR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.71-0.94, and OR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.42-0.92, respectively), but not among users of other antiepileptic drugs. Overall prostate cancer risk decreased in a dose-dependent manner by cumulative amount, duration and yearly dosage (intensity) of HDAC inhibitors valproic acid and carbamazepine. The risk of advanced prostate cancer was decreased only among carbamazepine users (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.44-0.96). Our results support possible prostate cancer preventive effects of HDAC inhibitors.

The study aimed to compare prostate-cancer-specific mortality risk estimates for different treatment options assigned by patients managed with active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP) and patients who had discontinued AS (DAS). Patients initially managed with AS or RP (N = 370) were matched according to length of therapy. All patients completed mailed questionnaires assessing their mortality risk estimates (in %) and prostate-cancer-specific anxiety. Differences in risk estimates among the three treatment groups were analyzed using ANOVA, relationships of clinical and psychosocial variables with risk estimates using standard multiple regression. In all treatment groups, the prostate- cancer-specific mortality risk was overestimated. This applied whether it was the patient's own treatment or the alternative treatment option. RP patients assigned a mortality risk to AS that was almost three times higher than that assigned to RP (50.9 ± 25.0 vs. 17.8 ± 19.7, d = 1.48; p < 0.001). Anxiety was significantly associated with risk estimates for AS (p = 0.008) and RP (p = 0.001). Compared with clinical data that suggest that the prostate-cancer-specific mortality risk for AS is low and does not significantly differ from that for RP, patients strongly overestimated the mortality risk. This was most markedly so in RP patients, who drastically overestimated the benefits of RP compared to the risk of AS.

Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) attracted our attention. SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression. However, the roles of SPAG5 in PCa progression remain unknown.  Methods:   SPAG5 expression level in clinical primary PCa, metastatic PCa, castration resistant PCa, neuroendocrine PCa, and normal prostate tissues was investigated. We established multiple in vivo xenografts models using patient-derived tissues and investigated SPAG5 expression trend in these models. We also investigated the functions of SPAG5 in vivo and in vitro studies. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate potential miRNAs that can regulate SPAG5.  Results:   We identified that SPAG5 expression was gradually increased in PCa progression and its level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence. Our results indicated that SPAG5 knockdown can drastically inhibit PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and supress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We identified that miR-539 can directly target SPAG5. Ectopic overexpression of miR-539 can drastically inhibit SPAG5 expression and the restoration of SPAG5 expression can reverse the inhibitory effects of miR-539 on PCa cell proliferation and metastasis.

We investigated the predictors of a better response to AAW and overall survival after acquiring resistance to first-line androgen deprivation therapy inpatients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 87 CRPC patients treated at Keio University Hospital. Sixty-seven of 87 CRPC patients underwent AAW. We analyzed clinicopathologic parameters to identify predictors of survival in CRPC patients and investigated predictors of good response to AAW.  Results:   Younger age, longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy before CRPC development, and better response to AAW were independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival. Although better response to AAW was a favorable prognostic factor in this study, trying AAW was not significantly related to overall survival. Duration of hormone therapy was significantly longer in those whose disease responded to AAW (69.9 ± 11.0 months) than those with no response (45.3 ± 5.2 months).

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on the records of 379 patients who underwent a first prostate biopsy with 12 to 16 cores under transrectal ultrasound guidance between September 2012 and April 2015. For each patient, the core length per cc of the prostate and the percentage of sampled prostate volume were calculated, and these values were compared between the patients with and without prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 348 patients were included in the study. Cancer was determined in 26.4% of patients. The mean core length taken per cc of prostate and the percentage of sampled prostate volume were determined to be 3.40 ± 0.15 mm/cc (0.26%; range, 0.08-0.63 cc) in patients with cancer and 2.75 ± 0.08 mm/cc (0.20%; range, 0.04-0.66 cc) in patients without cancer (P = .000 and P = .000), respectively. Core length taken per cc of prostate of > 3.31 mm/cc was found to be related to an increase in the rates of prostate cancer diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-4.78). The rate of cancer determination for core length taken per cc of prostate of < 3.31 mm/cc was 19.9% and of > 3.31 mm/cc, 41.1%.  Conclusions:   Core length taken per cc of prostate and the percentage of sampled prostate volume are important morphometric parameters in the determination of prostate cancer.

Ultrasound (US) image guided radiotherapy systems are currently available to collect US images at the simulation stage (USsim), coregistered with the simulation computed tomography (CT), and during all treatment fractions. The authors hypothesize that a deformation field derived from US-based deformable image registration can be used to create a daily pseudo-CT (CTps) image that is more representative of the patients' geometry during treatment than the CT acquired at simulation stage (CTsim).  Methods:   The three prostate patients, considered to evaluate this hypothesis, had coregistered CT and US scans on various days. In particular, two patients had two US-CT datasets each and the third one had five US-CT datasets. Deformation fields were computed between pairs of US images of the same patient and then applied to the corresponding USsim scan to yield a new deformed CTps scan. The original treatment plans were used to recalculate dose distributions in the simulation, deformed and ground truth CT (CTgt) images to compare dice similarity coefficients, maximum absolute distance, and mean absolute distance on CT delineations and gamma index (γ) evaluations on both the Hounsfield units (HUs) and the dose.  Results:   In the majority, deformation did improve the results for all three evaluation methods. The change in gamma failure for dose (γDose, 3%, 3 mm) ranged from an improvement of 11.2% in the prostate volume to a deterioration of 1.3% in the prostate and bladder. The change in gamma failure for the CT images (γCT, 50 HU, 3 mm) ranged from an improvement of 20.5% in the anus and rectum to a deterioration of 3.2% in the prostate.

Our previous work demonstrated that increased expression of Nurr1 plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), though the mechanisms for regulation of Nurr1 expression remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a key regulator of Nurr1 expression in PCa.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate levels of NLK and Nurr1 in prostatic tissues and cell lines. The effects of overexpression or knockdown of Nurr1 were evaluated in PCa cells through use of PCR, Western blots and promoter reporter assays. The role of Nurr1 promoter cis element was studied by creation of two mutant Nurr1 promoter luciferase constructs, one with a mutated NF-κB binding site and one with a mutated CREB binding site. In addition, three specific inhibitors were used to investigate the roles of these proteins in transcriptional activation of Nurr1, including BAY 11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor), KG-501 (CREB inhibitor) and ICG-001 (CREB binding protein, CBP, inhibitor). The function of CBP in NLK-mediated regulation of Nurr1 expression was investigated using immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIPs).  Results:   NLK expression was inversely correlated with Nurr1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of NLK suppressed Nurr1 promoter activity, leading to downregulation of Nurr1 expression. In contrast, knockdown of NLK demonstrated opposite results, leading to upregulation of Nurr1. When compared with the wild-type Nurr1 promoter, mutation of NF-κB- and CREB-binding sites of the Nurr1 promoter region significantly reduced the upregulation of Nurr1 induced by knockdown of NLK in LNCaP cells; treatment with inhibitors of CREB, CBP and NF-κB led to similar results. We also found that NLK directly interacts with CBP, that knockdown of NLK significantly increases the recruitment of CBP to both NF-κB- and CREB-binding sites, and that regulation of NLK on Nurr1 expression is abrogated by knockdown of CBP.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that NLK inhibits transcriptional activation of Nurr1 gene by impeding CBP's role as a co-activator of NF-κB and CREB in prostate cancer.""","""['Jian Wang', 'Zhi-Hong Yang', 'Hua Chen', 'Hua-Hui Li', 'Li-Yong Chen', 'Zhu Zhu', 'Ying Zou', 'Cong-Cong Ding', 'Jing Yang', 'Zhi-Wei He']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Nemo-like kinase suppresses a wide range of transcription factors, including nuclear factor-kappaB.', 'VEGF stimulates PKD-mediated CREB-dependent orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 expression: role in VEGF-induced angiogenesis.', 'Activation of thromboxane A(2) receptors induces orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 expression and stimulates cell proliferation in human lung cancer cells.', 'The emerging role of Nemo-like kinase (NLK) in the regulation of cancers.', 'Vitamin D autocrine system and prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Microglial Metabolic Rewiring Synergizes with Immune-Checkpoint Blockade Therapy for Glioblastoma.', 'Metformin-induced suppression of Nemo-like kinase improves erythropoiesis in preclinical models of Diamond-Blackfan anemia through induction of miR-26a.', 'Nurr1 performs its anti-inflammatory function by regulating RasGRP1 expression in neuro-inflammation.']"""

The purpose of this study was to develop and extensively characterize a series of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Four genetically distinct AR-positive and AR-pathway dependent prostate cancer cell lines (CWR-R1, LAPC-4, LNCaP, VCaP) were made resistant to enzalutamide by long-term culture (> 6 months) in enzalutamide. Extensive characterization of these lines documented divergent in vitro growth characteristics and AR pathway modulation. Enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP and CWR-R1 cells, but not LAPC-4 and VCAP cells, demonstrated increased castration-resistant and metastatic growth in vivo. Global gene expression analyses between short-term enzalutamide treated vs. enzalutamide-resistant cells identified both AR pathway and non-AR pathway associated changes that were restored upon acquisition of enzalutamide resistance. Further analyses revealed very few common gene expression changes between the four resistant cell lines.

PCAT‑1 suppression using PCAT‑1 small hairpin RNA in HepG2 and Bel‑7402 cells inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of PCAT‑1 induced synthetic plasmid vectors was demonstrated to increase cell proliferation and migration, and inhibit apoptosis.

Treatment with docetaxel (1‑50 nM) disposed the human LNCaP prostate cancer cells for 24 h.

Docetaxel-induced cell death was analyzed using flow cytometric and caspase-3 assays. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the gene expression of cofilin‑1 and western blots were used to determine the protein expression of paxillin. Treatment with docetaxel inhibited cell growth, promoted cytotoxicity, activated apoptosis and increased caspase‑3 activity in the LNCaP cells. Notably, administration of docetaxel reduced the gene expression of cofilin‑1 and the protein expression of paxillin in the LNCaP cells. Additionally, knockdown of cofilin‑1 advanced the anticancer effect of docetaxel against LNCaP cells through suppression of the paxillin pathway.

FOXA1 is a pioneer transcription factor in organogenesis and cancer progression. Genomewide mapping of FOXA1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing annotates that target genes associated with FOXA1 binding are mostly common to these cancer cells. However, most of the functional FOXA1 target genes are specific to each cancer cell type. Further investigations using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology indicate that cell-specific FOXA1 regulation is attributable to unique FOXA1 binding, genetic variations, and/or potential epigenetic regulation.

At the end of active treatment some cancer survivors report feeling disconnected from their care team. This study explores cancer survivors' experiences of patient-centered cancer follow-up care provided by primary care physicians (PCP) and oncologists (ONC).  Methods:   Three hundred five early stage, breast and prostate cancer survivors at least 2 years post treatment were surveyed from four community hospital oncology programs in New Jersey. Participants reported receipt of patient-centered care measured by care coordination, comprehensiveness of care, and personal relationship with PCPs and ONCs.  Results:   PCPs received higher ratings for coordination of care and comprehensive care than ONCs from all survivors (P < 0.01). However, prostate and breast cancer survivors rated strengths of their personal bonds with the physicians differently. While prostate cancer survivors rated PCPs significantly higher for all items (P < 0.028), breast cancer survivors rated ONCs significantly higher on four out of seven items including having been through a lot together, understanding what is important regarding health, knowing their medical history and taking their beliefs and wishes into account (P < 0.036).  Conclusions:   Prostate and breast cancer survivors report different experiences with their PCPs and oncologists around the comprehensiveness and coordination of their cancer follow-up care in addition to the strength of their relationships with their physicians.

The mechanism responsible for the transformation remains unclear. We studied the effects of an epigenetic modulator, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), on the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. After treatment with PEITC, floating spheres were formed with characteristics of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSC). These spheres were capable of self-renewal in media with and without androgen. They have been maintained in both types of media as long term cultures. Upon androgen deprivation, the adherent spheres differentiated to neuroendocrine cells (NEC) with decreased proliferation, expression of androgen receptor, and PSA. NEC reverse differentiated to spheres when androgen was replenished. The sphere cells expressed surface marker CD44 and had enhanced histone H3K4 acetylation, DNMT1 down-regulation and GSTP1 activation. We hypothesize that PEITC-mediated alteration in epigenomics of LNCaP cells may give rise to sphere cells, whereas reversible androgenomic alterations govern the shuttling between sphere PCSC and progeny NEC. Our findings identify unrecognized properties of prostate cancer sphere cells with multi-potential plasticity.

It is these germline mutations that can lead to cancer family syndromes whereby family members carrying a deleterious germline mutation have an increased susceptibility to certain cancer phenotypes. Common features of hereditary cancer syndromes include early age-of-onset, multiple affected generations, rare tumor types, and/or multiple primary malignancies. Approximately, 5%–10% of all common cancers, including prostate cancer, have a hereditary component and are attributable to highly penetrant germline mutations.

Material and methods:   A total of 364 patients underwent TRPB. All of the patients were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). All patients with a positive result for cancer or with previous erectile dysfunction in the initial assessment were excluded. Ninety-three patients were included and were assessed before the biopsy and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after the TRPB, using the IIEF-5 and assessing erectile function across these time periods.  Results:   We assessed 93 patients. During the first prebiopsy assessment, 100% of the patients scored ≥22 points. In the first postbiopsy evaluation at 4 weeks, 66.6% scored ≥ 22 points, and 33.3% had erectile dysfunction, thereby indicating a statistically significant reduction in the IIEF-5 score (P=.001). In the second postbiopsy evaluation, only 9.1% patients still had mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (P=.04). By the end, 92.48% of the patients scored ≥ 22 points, and 7.52% still had mild erectile dysfunction, without presenting a significant difference (P=.1).

Objective:   To incorporate an additional 10 yr of follow-up into an original analysis and to comprehensively evaluate the association between ejaculation frequency and PCa, accounting for screening, clinically relevant disease subgroups, and the impact of mortality from other causes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective cohort study of participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study utilizing self-reported data on average monthly ejaculation frequency. The study includes 31925 men who answered questions on ejaculation frequency on a 1992 questionnaire and followed through to 2010. The average monthly ejaculation frequency was assessed at three time points: age 20-29 yr, age 40-49 yr, and the year before questionnaire distribution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incidence of total PCa and clinically relevant disease subgroups. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results and limitations:   During 480831 person-years, 3839 men were diagnosed with PCa. Ejaculation frequency at age 40-49 yr was positively associated with age-standardized body mass index, physical activity, divorce, history of sexually transmitted infections, and consumption of total calories and alcohol. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test utilization by 2008, number of PSA tests, and frequency of prostate biopsy were similar across frequency categories. In multivariable analyses, the hazard ratio for PCa incidence for ≥21 compared to 4-7 ejaculations per month was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.92; p<0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 20-29 yr and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.89; p<0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 40-49 yr. Associations were driven by low-risk disease, were similar when restricted to a PSA-screened cohort, and were unlikely to be explained by competing causes of death.  Conclusions:   These findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent ejaculation throughout adult life in the etiology of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease.  Patient summary:   We evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related to prostate cancer risk in a large US-based study. We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.""","""['Jennifer R Rider', 'Kathryn M Wilson', 'Jennifer A Sinnott', 'Rachel S Kelly', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Edward L Giovannucci']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['More Is More: Disentangling the Importance of Ejaculation Frequency.', 'Re: Jennifer R.

PTEN is critical for stem cell maintenance, which contributes to its controlled tumorigenesis. PTEN loss leads the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that share properties with somatic stem cells, including the capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Methods to isolate and functionally test stem cells and CSCs are important for understanding PTEN functions and the development of therapeutic approaches to target CSCs without having adverse effects on normal stem cells.

Inclusion criteria comprised age<65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists score<3, body mass index<35 kg/m2, localized prostate cancer, and primary treatment. Postoperatively, close monitoring was conducted by telephone for the first 24 hours, with routine follow-up subsequently. This outpatient group was prospectively matched 1:1 with a concurrent inpatient RRP group who satisfied inclusion criteria for, but did not undergo, outpatient RRP. Validated questionnaires were administered prospectively to determine patient satisfaction and functional outcomes.  Results:   All outpatient RRP procedures were performed effectively. Twenty-six patients (87%) were discharged the same day of surgery, four stayed overnight for various reasons. On comparing outpatient and inpatient groups, there were no significant demographic or perioperative differences, except for shorter hospital stay (14 hours vs 44 hours, p<0.01). In both groups, 92% of patients were completely continent (no pads) at 2 months follow-up. Time to complete continence in the outpatient and inpatient groups was 32 days vs 43 days (p=0.09). Validated questionnaires revealed both groups were comparable as regards patient/family satisfaction, days of narcotic usage, days to return to work, and days to feeling 100% recovered.

Although he was admitted to be treated with intravenous antibiotics and topical debridement, the ulcer was rapidly increasing. In the laboratory findings, WBC was 12,400/μL, CRP was 16.9 mg/dL, ESR was 105mm in the first hour. Contrast enhanced CT images showed a wide high density area of skin and subcutaneous tissue around the stoma and dillitation of the transverse and descending colon. Colonoscopy showed furred profound ulcers in the rectum. A biopsy from the ulcer floor submitted to histopathology showed necrotic tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrates mainly composed of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the dermis. We suspected pyoderma gangrenosum with an inflammatory bowel disease in the beginning. Although he was started on oral prednisolone 60 mg daily, the ulcer did not respond to treatment. Additional methylprednisolone pulse therapy, intravenous cyclosporine and granulocytapheresis were also ineffective.

There is an unmet clinical need for noninvasive, easy to administer, diagnostic assays to help assess whether a prostate biopsy is warranted.  Objective:   To determine the performance of a novel urine exosome gene expression assay (the ExoDx Prostate IntelliScore urine exosome assay) plus standard of care (SOC) (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, age, race, and family history) vs SOC alone for discriminating between Gleason score (GS)7 and GS6 and benign disease on initial biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   In training, using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared the urine exosome gene expression assay with biopsy outcomes in 499 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 2 to 20 ng/mL. The derived prognostic score was then validated in 1064 patients from 22 community practice and academic urology clinic sites in the United States. Eligible participants included PCA-free men, 50 years or older, scheduled for an initial or repeated prostate needle biopsy due to suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings and/or PSA levels (limit range, 2.0-20.0 ng/mL).  Main outcomes and measures:   Evaluate the assay using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in discrimination of GS7 or greater from GS6 and benign disease on initial biopsy.  Results:   In 255 men in the training target population (median age 62 years and median PSA level 5.0 ng/mL, and initial biopsy), the urine exosome gene expression assay plus SOC was associated with improved discrimination between GS7 or greater and GS6 and benign disease: AUC 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83) vs SOC AUC 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58-0.72) (P < .001). Independent validation in 519 patients' urine exosome gene expression assay plus SOC AUC 0.73 (95% CI, 0.68-0.77) was superior to SOC AUC 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58-0.68) (P < .001). Using a predefined cut point, 138 of 519 (27%) biopsies would have been avoided, missing only 5% of patients with dominant pattern 4 high-risk GS7 disease.  Conclusions and relevance:   This urine exosome gene expression assay is a noninvasive, urinary 3-gene expression assay that discriminates high-grade (≥GS7) from low-grade (GS6) cancer and benign disease. In this study, the urine exosome gene expression assay was associated with improved identification of patients with higher-grade prostate cancer among men with elevated PSA levels and could reduce the total number of unnecessary biopsies.""","""['James McKiernan', 'Michael J Donovan', ""Vince O'Neill"", 'Stefan Bentink', 'Mikkel Noerholm', 'Susan Belzer', 'Johan Skog', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Alan Partin', 'Gerald Andriole', 'Gordon Brown', 'John T Wei', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Peter Carroll']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['A Prospective Adaptive Utility Trial to Validate Performance of a Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen 2-10ng/ml at Initial Biopsy.', 'A molecular signature of PCA3 and ERG exosomal RNA from non-DRE urine is predictive of initial prostate biopsy result.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The role of prostate cancer biomarkers in undiagnosed men.', 'Network approach in liquidomics landscape.', ""Exosome Analysis in Prostate Cancer: How They Can Improve Biomarkers' Performance."", 'Paper-based biosensors as point-of-care diagnostic devices for the detection of cancers: a review of innovative techniques and clinical applications.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes in Bone Regeneration.']"""

Despite its widespread use, there is a paucity of data regarding its safety and efficacy as well as its mechanism of action in human cells. Herein, we demonstrate that DMSO has ex-vivo anti-inflammatory activity using Escherichia coli- (E. coli) and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)-stimulated whole human blood. Specifically, we found that between 0.5%-2%, DMSO significantly suppressed the expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However, a significant reduction in monocyte viability was also observed at 2% DMSO, suggesting a narrow window of efficacy. Anti-inflammatory concentrations of DMSO suppressed E. coli-induced ERK1/2, p38, JNK and Akt phosphorylation, suggesting DMSO acts on these signaling pathways to suppress inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Although DMSO induces the differentiation of B16/F10 melanoma cells in vitro, topical administration of DMSO to mice subcutaneously implanted with B16 melanoma cells was ineffective at reducing tumor growth, DMSO was also found to block mouse macrophages from polarizing to either an M1- or an M2-phenotype, which may contribute to its inability to slow tumor growth. Topical administration of DMSO, however, significantly mitigated K/BxN serum-induced arthritis in mice, and this was associated with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the joints and white blood cell levels in the blood.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the database of 2316 patients at our institution who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)/radical prostatectomy (RP) between July 2005 and November 2012. 87 patients with pN1 PCa and received no neoadjuvant and immediate adjuvant therapy were included in the study. Included pN1 PCa patients were followed up for median of 60 months. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, metastasis-free survival (MFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) rates were determined by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, positive surgical margin, tumor volume, early post-operative PSA(6 weeks), PSA nadir, lymph node yield, and number of pathologically positive lymph nodes on survival.  Results:   The 5-year OS rate of patients was 86.1%, while the CSS rate was 89.6%. The metastasis-free and BCR-free survival rates were 71% and 19.1%, respectively, and each was significantly correlated with the number of positive lymph nodes on log rank tests (p = 0.004 and p = 0.039, respectively). The presence of 2 or more pathologically positive LNs (HR:2.20; 95% CI 1.30-3.72; p = 0.003) and a Gleason score ≥8 (HR: 2.40;95% CI: 1.32-4.38; p = 0.04) were significant negative predictors of BCR free survival on multivariable regression analysis. Furthermore, the presence of 2 or more positive lymph nodes (HR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.11; p = 0.029) were significant negative predictors of metastasis-free survival on multivariable regression analysis. Additionally, in the patients who had no BCR without adjuvant treatment 9 patients out of 10 (90%) had single positive LN and 5 patients out of 10 (50%) had Gleason score 7. Therefore, single positive LN, and Gleason scores ≤7 have significantly low risk of disease progression.  Conclusions:   pN1 PCa patients have heterogenous clinical courses. Patients with single positive LN, and Gleason scores ≤7 have low risk of recurrence. Close observation with delayed adjuvant hormone therapy can be considered in these patients.""","""['Dae Keun Kim', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Ali Abdel Raheem', 'Ki Hong Kim', 'Byung Ha Chung', 'Young Deuk Choi', 'Koon Ho Rha']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Small-volume lymph node involvement and biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Localized prostate carcinoma.

Methods:   Median treatment duration and median OS data from published Phase 3 clinical trials and prescribing information were used to calculate costs per median OS month based on wholesale acquisition costs (WACs) for patients with mCRPC treated with AA + P or enzalutamide. Sensitivity analyses were performed to understand how variations in treatment duration and treatment-related monitoring recommendations influenced cost per median OS month. Cost-effectiveness estimates of other Phase 3 trial outcomes were also explored: cost per month of chemotherapy avoided and per median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) month.  Results:   The results demonstrated that AA + P has a lower cost per median OS month than enzalutamide ($3231 vs 4512; 28% reduction), based on the following assumptions: median treatment duration of 14 months for AA + P and 18 months for enzalutamide, median OS of 34.7 months for AA + P and 35.3 months for enzalutamide, and WAC per 30-day supply of $8007.17 for AA + P vs $8847.98 for enzalutamide. Sensitivity analyses showed that accounting for recommended treatment-related monitoring costs or assuming identical treatment durations for AA + P and enzalutamide (18 months) resulted in costs per median OS month 8-27% lower for AA + P than for enzalutamide. Costs per month of chemotherapy avoided were $4448 for AA + P and $5688 for enzalutamide, while costs per month to achieve median rPFS were $6794 for AA + P and $7963 for enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that costs per median OS month, along with costs of other Phase 3 trial outcomes, were lower for AA + P than for enzalutamide.

Hence, more robust therapeutic/preventive regimes are required to combat this lethal disease. In the current study, we have tested the efficacy of Andrographolide (AG), a bioactive diterpenoid isolated from Andrographis paniculata, against PCa. This natural agent selectively affects PCa cell viability in a dose and time-dependent manner, without affecting primary prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, AG showed differential effect on cell cycle phases in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 cells compared to retinoblastoma protein (RB(-/-)) and CDKN2A lacking DU-145 cells. G2/M transition was blocked in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 after AG treatment whereas DU-145 cells failed to transit G1/S phase. This difference was primarily due to differential activation of cell cycle regulators in these cell lines. Levels of cyclin A2 after AG treatment increased in all PCa cells line. Cyclin B1 levels increased in LNCaP and PC3, decreased in C4-2b and showed no difference in DU-145 cells after AG treatment. AG decreased cyclin E2 levels only in PC3 and DU-145 cells. It also altered Rb, H3, Wee1 and CDC2 phosphorylation in PCa cells. Intriguingly, AG reduced cell viability and the ability of PCa cells to migrate via modulating CXCL11 and CXCR3 and CXCR7 expression. The significant impact of AG on cellular and molecular processes involved in PCa progression suggests its potential use as a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for PCa.""","""['Hina Mir', 'Neeraj Kapur', 'Rajesh Singh', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'James W Lillard Jr', 'Shailesh Singh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['HOXB13 contributes to G1/S and G2/M checkpoint controls in prostate.', 'CXCL11 promotes tumor progression by the biased use of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR7.', 'How can food extracts consumed in the Mediterranean and East Asia suppress prostate cancer proliferation?', 'Molecular mechanisms controlling the cell cycle: fundamental aspects and implications for oncology.', 'Anticancer potential of andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.)

This study explores urologists' perceptions about their conversational practices leading to decision-making by newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients facing treatment. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 community and academic urologists practicing in the St. Louis, MO, region. Data were analyzed using a consensus coding approach. Urologists reported spending 30-60 min with newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients when discussing treatment options. They frequently encouraged family members' involvement in discussions about treatment, especially patients' spouses and children. Participants perceived these conversations to be difficult given the emotional burden associated with a cancer diagnosis, and encouraged patients to postpone their decisions or to get a second opinion before finalizing their treatment of choice. Initial discussions included a presentation of treatment options relevant to the patient's condition, side effects, outcome probabilities, and next steps. Urologists seldom used statistics while talking about treatment outcome probabilities and preferred to explain outcomes in terms of the patient's practical, emotional, and social experiences. Their styles to elicit the patient's preferences ranged from explicitly asking questions to making assumptions based on clinical experience and subtle patient cues. In conclusion, urologists' routine conversations included most elements of shared decision-making. However, shared decision-making required urologists to have nuanced discussions and be skilled in elicitation methods and risk discussions which requires further training.

The acridine orange/propodium iodide staining showed apoptogenic properties of n-hexane and dichloromethane extracts which was consequently confirmed by flow cytometric histogram that exhibited an increase in sub-G1 peak in treated cells as compared with untreated cancer cell lines.

These functions of mTOR are thought to be largely a consequence of its cytoplasmic activity in regulating translation rate, but accumulating data highlight supplementary role(s) for this serine/threonine kinase within the nucleus. Indeed, the nuclear activities of mTOR are currently associated with the control of protein biosynthetic capacity through its ability to regulate the expression of gene products involved in the control of ribosomal biogenesis and proliferation. Using primary murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), we observed that cells with overactive mTOR signaling displayed higher abundance for the growth-associated Npm1 protein, in what represents a novel mechanism of Npm1 gene regulation. We show that Npm1 gene expression is dependent on mTOR as demonstrated by treatment of wild-type and Pten inactivated MEFs cultured with rapamycin or by transient transfections of small interfering RNA directed against mTOR. In accordance, the mTOR kinase localizes to the Npm1 promoter gene in vivo and it enhances the activity of a human NPM1-luciferase reporter gene providing an opportunity for direct control. Interestingly, rapamycin did not dislodge mTOR from the Npm1 promoter but rather strongly destabilized the Npm1 transcript by increasing its turnover. Using a prostate-specific Pten-deleted mouse model of cancer, Npm1 mRNA levels were found up-regulated and sensitive to rapamycin. Finally, we also showed that Npm1 is required to promote mTOR-dependent cell proliferation. We therefore proposed a model whereby mTOR is closely involved in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of Npm1 gene expression with implications in development and diseases including cancer.""","""['Rafik Boudra', 'Rosyne Lagrafeuille', 'Corinne Lours-Calet', 'Cyrille de Joussineau', 'Gaëlle Loubeau-Legros', 'Cédric Chaveroux', 'Jean-Paul Saru', 'Silvère Baron', 'Laurent Morel', 'Claude Beaudoin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['High glucose-induced hypertrophy of mesangial cells is reversed by connexin43 overexpression via PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling.', 'Threonine-120 phosphorylation regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway signaling limits the antitumor activity of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1.', 'AP-1 regulates cyclin D1 and c-MYC transcription in an AKT-dependent manner in response to mTOR inhibition: role of AIP4/Itch-mediated JUNB degradation.', 'Targeting the translational apparatus to improve leukemia therapy: roles of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'The role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes signaling in the immune responses.', 'Microarray analysis and functional prediction of differentially expressed circular RNAs in acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.', 'O-GlcNAc Transferase Inhibition Differentially Affects Breast Cancer Subtypes.', 'Perturbation of RNA Polymerase I transcription machinery by ablation of HEATR1 triggers the RPL5/RPL11-MDM2-p53 ribosome biogenesis stress checkpoint pathway in human cells.']"""

Here, we report unexpected anticancerogenic effects of hydroethanolic Iberis amara extract (IAE), which is known as a widely used phytomedical product for treating gastrointestinal complaints. IAE significantly inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 and T84 colon carcinoma cells with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 and 9 μg/ml, respectively, and further generated inhibitory effects in PC-3 prostate and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Inhibition of proliferation in HT-29 cells was associated with a G2/M phase cell cycle arrest including reduced expression of various regulatory marker proteins. Notably, in HT-29 cells IAE further induced apoptosis by intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistent with predictions derived from our in vitro experiments, bidaily oral gavage of 50 mg/kg of IAE over 4 weeks resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse HT-29 tumor xenograft model. Taken together, Iberis amara extracts could become useful alternatives for preventing and treating the progression of colon cancer.""","""['Christopher Weidner', 'Morten Rousseau', 'Annabell Plauth', 'Sylvia J Wowro', 'Cornelius Fischer', 'Heba Abdel-Aziz', 'Sascha Sauer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Melissa officinalis extract induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in colon cancer cells through formation of reactive oxygen species.', 'Antioxidative properties of Iberis amara extracts in biochemical model reactions.', 'PC-SPES inhibits colon cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Iberis amara L.

Despite some success in transiently controlling clinical symptoms with docetaxel-based therapy, PCa patients become docetaxel-resistant and inevitably progress with no cure. We synthesized an acyl-tyrosine bisphosphonate amide derivative, BKM1644, with the intent of targeting bone metastatic PCa and enhancing docetaxel's efficacy. BKM1644 exhibits potent anti-cancer activity in the NCI-60 panel and effectively inhibits the proliferation of metastatic, castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) cells, with IC50 ranging between 2.1 μM and 6.3 μM. Significantly, BKM1644 sensitizes mCRPC cells to docetaxel treatment. Mice with pre-established C4-2 tumors in the tibia show a marked decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (control: 173.72 ± 37.52 ng/ml, combined treatment: 64.45 ± 22.19 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) and much improved bone architecture after treatment with the combined regimen. Mechanistic studies found that docetaxel temporarily but significantly increases survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein whose overexpression has been correlated with PCa bone metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Intriguingly, BKM1644 effectively inhibits survivin expression, which may antagonize docetaxel-induced survivin in bone metastatic PCa cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) may be involved in the suppression of survivin transcription by BKM1644, as confirmed by a survivin reporter assay. Collectively, these data indicate that BKM1644 could be a promising small-molecule agent to improve docetaxel efficacy and retard the bone metastatic growth of PCa.""","""['Shumin Zhang', 'Lajos Gera', 'Kenza Mamouni', 'Xin Li', 'Zhengjia Chen', 'Omer Kucuk', 'Daqing Wu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Small molecule BKM1972 inhibits human prostate cancer growth and overcomes docetaxel resistance in intraosseous models.', 'BKM1740, an acyl-tyrosine bisphosphonate amide derivative, inhibits the bone metastatic growth of human prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.', 'Mifepristone Has Limited Activity to Enhance the In Vivo Efficacy of Docetaxel and Enzalutamide Against Bone Metastatic and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'Prostate cancer and bone: clinical presentation and molecular mechanisms.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of noncanonical EED-EZH2 signaling overcomes chemoresistance in prostate cancer.', 'Distinct roles for the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 in prostate cancer.', 'Small molecule BKM1972 inhibits human prostate cancer growth and overcomes docetaxel resistance in intraosseous models.', 'Repositioning Dopamine D2 Receptor Agonist Bromocriptine to Enhance Docetaxel Chemotherapy and Treat Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of two novel highly lipophilic anticancer drug candidates in rat plasma and tissues.']"""

This study investigates a MCO algorithm for VMAT planning (VMAT-MCO) for prostate cancer treatments including pelvic lymph nodes and uses standard inverse VMAT optimization (sVMAT) and Tomotherapy planning as benchmarks.  Methods:   For each of ten prostate cancer patients, a two stage plan was generated, consisting of a stage 1 plan delivering 22Gy to the prostate, and a stage 2 plan delivering 50.4Gy to the lymph nodes and 56Gy to the prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost. The single plans were generated by three planning techniques (VMAT-MCO, sVMAT, Tomotherapy) and subsequently compared with respect to plan quality and planning time efficiency.  Results:   Plan quality was similar for all techniques, but sVMAT showed slightly better rectum (on average Dmean -7%) and bowel sparing (Dmean -17%) compared to VMAT-MCO in the whole pelvic treatments. Tomotherapy plans exhibited higher bladder dose (Dmean +42%) in stage 1 and lower rectum dose (Dmean -6%) in stage 2 than VMAT-MCO. Compared to manual planning, the planning time with MCO was reduced up to 12 and 38min for stage 1 and 2 plans, respectively.  Conclusion:   MCO can generate highly conformal prostate VMAT plans with minimal workload in the settings of prostate-only treatments and prostate plus lymph nodes irradiation. In the whole pelvic plan manual VMAT optimization led to slightly improved OAR sparing over VMAT-MCO, whereas for the primary prostate treatment plan quality was equal.""","""['Martin Buschmann', 'Yvette Seppenwoolde', 'Tilo Wiezorek', 'Kirsten Weibert', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'A dosimetric comparison of tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with pelvic nodal radiation therapy.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy using multicriteria optimization for body and extremity sarcoma.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Monaco treatment planning system tools and optimization processes.', 'Automatic Planning for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Based on Progressive Optimization in RayStation Treatment Planning System.', 'Normal tissue sparing using different techniques for prostate irradiation.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automation of radiation treatment planning : Evaluation of head and neck cancer patient plans created by the Pinnacle3 scripting and Auto-Planning functions.']"""

A key question is whether ""personalising"" choice within decisions aids leads to better decision quality.  Objective:   To assess the effect of personalising the content of a decision aid for prostate cancer screening using the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test.  Design:   Randomized controlled trial.  Setting:   Australia.  Participants:   1,970 men aged 40-69 years were approached to participate in the trial.  Intervention:   1,447 men were randomly allocated to either a standard decision aid with a fixed set of five attributes or a personalised decision aid with choice over the inclusion of up to 10 attributes.  Outcome measures:   To determine whether there was a difference between the two groups in terms of: 1) the emergent opinion (generated by the decision aid) to have a PSA test or not; 2) self-rated decision quality after completing the online decision aid; 3) their intention to undergo screening in the next 12 months. We also wanted to determine whether men in the personalised choice group made use of the extra decision attributes.  Results:   5% of men in the fixed attribute group scored 'Have a PSA test' as the opinion generated by the aid, as compared to 62% of men in the personalised choice group (χ2 = 569.38, 2df, p< 0001). Those men who used the personalised decision aid had slightly higher decision quality (t = 2.157, df = 1444, p = 0.031). The men in the personalised choice group made extensive use of the additional decision attributes. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of their stated intention to undergo screening in the next 12 months.  Conclusions:   Together, these findings suggest that personalised decision support systems could be an important development in shared decision-making and patient-centered care.

Knocking down TR4 with TR4-siRNA in HCC Huh7 and Hep3B cells increased cisplatin chemotherapy resistance and overexpression of TR4 with TR4-cDNA in HCC LM3 and SNU387 cells increased cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity. Mechanism dissection found that TR4 might function through altering the ATF3 expression at the transcriptional level to enhance the cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity, and interrupting ATF3 expression via ATF3-siRNA reversed TR4-enhanced cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity in HCC cells. The in vivo HCC mouse model using xenografted HCC LM3 cells also confirmed in vitro cell lines data showing TR4 enhanced the cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity.

Materials and methods:   We searched our institutional pathology database between 2004 and 2015 for pathology reports detailing extraprostatic extension on prostate biopsy in untreated patients. Patient characteristics, biopsy features, imaging interpretations and outcomes were examined.  Results:   Of 19,950 patients with prostate cancer on biopsy 112 had extraprostatic extension for a prevalence of 0.6% (95% CI 0.5-0.7). Most of the 112 patients had palpable, high grade (Gleason score 9), high volume disease, which was classified as high risk in 34 (30%), locally advanced in 17 (15%) and metastatic in 39 (35%). Most patients had 1 or 2 cores with extraprostatic extension, typically at the base and with concomitant perineural invasion. Extraprostatic extension was identified by magnetic resonance imaging in 32 of 40 patients (80%). Median followup in those who did not die was 1.3 years (IQR 0.3-4.2). Outcomes in the subgroup of 24 men treated with radical prostatectomy were consistent with high risk disease, including positive margins in 14 (58%), seminal vesicle invasion in 10 (42%) and lymph node invasion in 11 (46%). In the entire cohort the 3-year risks of metastasis and overall mortality were 32% (95% CI 22-44) and 37% (95% CI 27-50), respectively.

Acquisition of resistance to conventional therapy is a major problem for PCa patient management. Several mechanisms have been described to promote therapy resistance in PCa, such as androgen receptor (AR) activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquisition of stem cell properties and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD). Recently, we identified Brachyury as a new biomarker of PCa aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In the present study we aimed to assess the role of Brachyury in PCa therapy resistance. We showed that Brachyury overexpression in prostate cancer cells lines increased resistance to docetaxel and cabazitaxel drugs, whereas Brachyury abrogation induced decrease in therapy resistance. Through ChiP-qPCR assays we further demonstrated that Brachyury is a direct regulator of AR expression as well as of the biomarker AMACR and the mesenchymal markers Snail and Fibronectin. Furthermore, in vitro Brachyury was also able to increase EMT and stem properties. By in silico analysis, clinically human Brachyury-positive PCa samples were associated with biomarkers of PCa aggressiveness and therapy resistance, including PTEN loss, and expression of NEtD markers, ERG and Bcl-2. Taken together, our results indicate that Brachyury contributes to tumor chemotherapy resistance, constituting an attractive target for advanced PCa patients.""","""['Filipe Pinto', 'Nelma Pértega-Gomes', 'José R Vizcaíno', 'Raquel P Andrade', 'Flavio M Cárcano', 'Rui Manuel Reis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Transfection of T-Box Transcription Factor BRACHYURY and SOX2 Synergistically Promote Self-Renewal and Invasive Phenotype in Oral Cancer Cells.', 'Overexpression of brachyury contributes to tumor metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'An autocrine loop between TGF-β1 and the transcription factor brachyury controls the transition of human carcinoma cells into a mesenchymal phenotype.', 'Understanding Molecular Pathways and Targets of Brachyury in Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Human Cancers.', 'Regulation of tumor cell plasticity by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Multiple malignant tumors in a patient with familial chordoma, a case report.', 'The Roles of Embryonic Transcription Factor BRACHYURY in Tumorigenesis and Progression.', 'Suppression of α-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase by miR200c inhibits prostate adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration.', 'Epigenetic changes in fibroblasts drive cancer metabolism and differentiation.', 'Exploration of the diagnostic value and molecular mechanism of miR‑1 in prostate cancer: A study based on meta‑analyses and bioinformatics.']"""

In this study, we investigated the role of AR-V7 in the cross-resistance of enzalutamide and abiraterone and examined if inhibition of AR-V7 can improve abiraterone treatment response. We found that enzalutamide-resistant cells are cross-resistant to abiraterone, and that AR-V7 confers resistance to abiraterone. Knock down of AR-V7 by siRNA in abiraterone resistant CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells restored their sensitivity to abiraterone, indicating that AR-V7 is involved in abiraterone resistance. Abiraterone resistant prostate cancer cells generated by chronic treatment with abiraterone showed enhanced AR-V7 protein expression.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is being increasingly used as an important modality to localize prostate cancer. Therefore, localizing prostate cancer in MRI with automated detection methods has become an active area of research. Many methods have been proposed for this task. However, most of previous methods focused on identifying cancer only in the peripheral zone (PZ), or classifying suspicious cancer ROIs into benign tissue and cancer tissue. Few works have been done on developing a fully automatic method for cancer localization in the entire prostate region, including central gland (CG) and transition zone (TZ). In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based multi-source integration framework to directly localize prostate cancer regions from in vivo MRI. We employ random forests to effectively integrate features from multi-source images together for cancer localization. Here, multi-source images include initially the multi-parametric MRIs (i.e., T2, DWI, and dADC) and later also the iteratively-estimated and refined tissue probability map of prostate cancer. Experimental results on 26 real patient data show that our method can accurately localize cancerous sections. The higher section-based evaluation (SBE), combined with the ROC analysis result of individual patients, shows that the proposed method is promising for in vivo MRI based prostate cancer localization, which can be used for guiding prostate biopsy, targeting the tumor in focal therapy planning, triage and follow-up of patients with active surveillance, as well as the decision making in treatment selection. The common ROC analysis with the AUC value of 0.832 and also the ROI-based ROC analysis with the AUC value of 0.883 both illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.""","""['Chunjun Qian', 'Li Wang', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Ambereen Yousuf', 'Xiaoping Yang', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Multicenter validation of prostate tumor localization using multiparametric MRI and prior knowledge.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection using T2-weighted and high-b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Automated prostate cancer localization without the need for peripheral zone extraction using multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MRI of the prostate.', 'Deep Multi-Objective Learning from Low-Dose CT for Automatic Lung-RADS Report Generation.', 'Can machine learning-based analysis of multiparameter MRI and clinical parameters improve the performance of clinically significant prostate cancer diagnosis?', 'Boundary Coding Representation for Organ Segmentation in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Prediction of postoperative complications of pediatric cataract patients using data mining.', 'Fully automatic segmentation of paraspinal muscles from 3D torso CT images via multi-scale iterative random forest classifications.']"""

However, the mechanism underlying its clinical efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we found that β-lap provoked the cleavage of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in  Nad(p)h:   quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1)-expressing lung and prostate cancer cells as well as in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These actions of β-lap were different from that of the conventional Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. As a consequence of Hsp90 cleavage, Hsp90-associated oncoproteins, such as receptor-interacting protein, Raf-1, AKT, and CDK4, were degraded in treated cancer cells, and key receptor tyrosine kinases such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 and Her-2 were degraded in treated HUVECs through a proteasomal system. Further results revealed that specific inhibitors of NQO1 and reactive oxygen species could dramatically reduce β-lap-mediated Hsp90 cleavage. In addition to its cytotoxicity, β-lap effectively inhibited angiogenesis by suppressing tube formation and the invasion of HUVECs in vitro, rat aortic microvascular sprouts ex vivo, and mouse corneal neovascularization in vivo. Furthermore, β-lap markedly suppressed the growth and angiogenesis of human lung cancer xenografts in nude mice and decreased the levels of receptor-interacting protein, AKT, CDK4, and CD31 in the solid tumors. Unlike other NQO1-dependent cytotoxic quinones, such as streptonigrin, menadione, mitomycin, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, β-lap was the only agent that could cause Hsp90 cleavage.

EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) gene played an important role in many tumors, including lung cancer, hepatic carcinoma, and prostate cancer. In addition, it was importantly downexpressed in breast cancer. The present research aimed to assess the association between genetic variations of EFEMP1 and breast cancer risk.  Materials and methods:   The authors genotyped 11 common tagging SNPs with an array platform including 960 cases and 972 cancer-free controls of Chinese women, according to the HapMap database based on the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) r² threshold of 0.8, minor allele frequency of 0.05.  Results:   Three SNPs were significant associated with breast cancer (rs3791679, p = 0.016, OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.04-1.41; rs1346786, p = 0.005, OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.08 -1.59; rs727878, p = 0.002, OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.10-1.51). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared with wild-type carriers in a dominant model, a significantly increased breast cancer risk was associated with the three identified risk SNPs. Among the selected tagging SNPs, three haplotype blocks were identified, and the results of haplotype analysis were consistent with the single-locus analysis. The haplotype 'GG' in block 1 and haplotype 'AG' in block 2 were significantly associated with breast cancer, and had a 54% and 28% increased breast cancer risk respectively, compared with their corresponding noncarriers.  Conclusions:   The present results suggested that the polymorphisms of EFEMP1 gene were associated with breast cancer and might contribute to the susceptibility of the progression of breast cancer in Chinese Han women.

Co-targeting alternate resistance pathways are of significant interest to treat CRPC and delay the onset of resistance. Both the AKT and MEK signaling pathways become activated as prostate cancer develops resistance to AR-targeted therapies. This pre-clinical study explores co-targeting these pathways in AR-positive prostate cancer models. Using various in vitro models of prostate cancer disease states including androgen dependent (LNCaP), CRPC (V16D and 22RV1) and ENZ-resistant prostate cancer (MR49C and MR49F), we evaluate the relevance of targeting both AKT and MEK pathways. Our data reveal that AKT inhibition induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in PTEN null cell lines independently of their sensitivity to hormone therapy; however, AKT inhibition had no effect on the PTEN positive 22RV1 cell line. Interestingly, we found that MEK inhibition had greater effect on 22RV1 cells compared to LNCaP, V16D or ENZ-resistant cells MR49C and MR49F cells. In vitro, combination AKT and MEK blockade had evidence of synergy observed in some cell lines and assays, but this was not consistent across all results. In vivo, the combination of AKT and MEK inhibition resulted in more consistent tumor growth inhibition of MR49F xenografts and longer disease specific survival compared to AKT inhibitor monotherapy. As in our in vitro study, 22RV1 xenografts were more resistant to AKT inhibition while they were more sensitive to MEK inhibition. Our results suggest that targeting AKT and MEK in combination may be a valuable strategy in prostate cancer when both pathways are activated and further support the importance of characterizing the dominant oncogenic pathway in each patient's tumor in order to select optimal therapy.""","""['Paul Toren', 'Soojin Kim', 'Fraser Johnson', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Reciprocal feedback inhibition of the androgen receptor and PI3K as a novel therapy for castrate-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of sorafenib and enzalutamide as a potential new approach for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'New Compounds Targeting the Androgen Receptor for Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Co-Targeting ErbB Receptors and the PI3K/AKT Axis in Androgen-Independent Taxane-Sensitive and Taxane-Resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting the Lnc-OPHN1-5/androgen receptor/hnRNPA1 complex increases Enzalutamide sensitivity to better suppress prostate cancer progression.', 'Identification of Somatic Gene Signatures in Circulating Cell-Free DNA Associated with Disease Progression in Metastatic Prostate Cancer by a Novel Machine Learning Platform.', 'miR-5089-5p suppresses castration-resistant prostate cancer resistance to enzalutamide and metastasis via miR-5089-5p/SPINK1/ MAPK/MMP9 signaling.']"""

Patients and methods In total, 106 patients with CaP had evaluations of GI symptoms (modified LENT-SOMA questionnaires) before EBRT and at one month, one, two and three years after its completion. Other variables measured before EBRT were: 1) plasma concentrations of homocysteine and micronutrients including caroteinoids and selenium; 2) chromosome damage/DNA misrepair (micronuclei/nucleoplasmic bridge) indices; and 3) mean anal and rectal wall doses and volumes of anal and rectal walls receiving ≥40 Gy and ≥60 Gy. Univariate and multivariate analyzes examined the relationships among: 1) plasma levels of homocysteine and micronutrients; 2) indices of chromosome damage/DNA misrepair; and 3) mean anal and rectal wall doses and volumes of anal and rectal walls receiving ≥40 Gy and ≥60 Gy and total GI symptom scores from one month to three years after EBRT. Results Increased frequency and urgency of defecation, rectal mucous discharge and bleeding after EBRT resulted in sustained rises in total GI symptom scores above baseline at three years. On univariate analysis, total GI symptom scores were significantly associated with: 1) plasma selenium and α tocopherol; 2) micronuclei indices of DNA damage; 3) mean anal and rectal wall doses; and 4) volumes of anal and rectal wall receiving ≥40 Gy and ≥60 Gy (p = 0.08-<0.001). On multivariate analysis, only volume of anal wall receiving ≥40 Gy was significant for increased GI symptoms after EBRT (p < 0.001).

Several studies have demonstrated that hormones are somehow related to the growth of meningiomas.  Case description:   A 72-year-old man with benign meningioma underwent tumor resection and had no recurrence for 18 years. He was found to have prostate cancer, and he received hormonal therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. Two years later, he developed severe cognitive dysfunction and gait disturbance. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large recurrent mass and obstructive hydrocephalus. Staged resection was performed and stereotactic radiation therapy was administered against the residual tumor. His symptoms improved after endoscopic third ventriculostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus and his residual tumor remains stable.  Conclusions:   This is the first report of a case in which an LHRH agonist promoted the growth of a pre-existing meningioma.

Patients and methods:   From April 2012 to August 2015, 3 surgeons performed RALP on 355 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. Among these cases, 184 were by surgeon A with prior open experiences, 92 by surgeon B with both open and laparoscopic experiences, and 79 by surgeon C with laparoscopic experiences only. Perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes were evaluated and compared between surgeons. Learning curve patterns were evaluated to determine the number of cases to reach plateau.  Results:   Marked difference was observed in operative time among the 3 groups (all P <.05). Length of hospital stay was also statistically significant (all P <.001), except for that between Group B and Group C (P = .739). Continence at 1-year and 6-month postoperatively was better in Groups B and C compared with Group A (P <.001). Intraoperative blood loss, pathologic stage, positive surgical margin, biochemical recurrence-free rate, and other pathological findings showed no statistical significance between the groups. The number of cases required to reach plateau may vary for surgeons with different surgical experiences.

Here, we report descriptive post-hoc analyses, using the more strict definition for EF-recovery of returning back to the pre-surgery IIEF-EF-level (""back-to-baseline analysis"").  Methods:   REACTT included 422 men <68 years with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and preoperative IIEF-EF ≥22 who underwent nsRP at 50 centers from 9 European countries and Canada. Patients were randomized post-nsRP 1:1:1 to 9-month double-blind treatment (DBT) with tadalafil 5 mg OaD (n = 139), tadalafil 20 mg on-demand (pro-re-nata, PRN; n = 142), or placebo (n = 141), followed by 6-week drug-free washout (DFW) and 3-month open-label tadalafil OaD treatment (OLT).  Main outcome measures:   Proportion of patients returning to their preoperative IIEF-EF category (22-25 or ≥26) at the end of DBT, DFW, and OLT.  Results:   Overall, 92.4% of patients had pre-surgery (baseline) IIEF-EF scores ≥26 (tadalafil OaD 94.2%, PRN 91.6%, placebo 91.5%), 7.4% had IIEF-EF 22-25. At the end of DBT, 22.3% of patients on tadalafil OaD had achieved ""back-to-baseline"" IIEF-EF, compared with 11.3% on tadalafil PRN and 7.8% on placebo. Of all 58 patients ""back-to-baseline"" at the end of DBT, only 1 PRN-group patient had started from a baseline IIEF-EF <26. The treatment-group difference at the end of DBT was not maintained after DFW. After 3 months of OLT with tadalafil OaD, the proportion of patients with ""back-to-baseline"" IIEF-EF had almost doubled in all 3 groups.  Conclusion:   Changing the definition for EF-recovery from IIEF-EF ≥22 to the more strict definition of ""returning back-to-baseline IIEF-EF"" had no major impact.

Aim:   We aimed at evaluating overall satisfaction (OS) after BNSRP according to the ability to achieve the pretreatment EF.  Methods:   We evaluated data of 652 patients treated with BNSRP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Erectile dysfunction (ED) was classified according to the IIEF-EF domain score. Return to baseline EF was defined as patients who reached the same preoperative ED category during the 3-year follow-up. Cox regression analyses were fitted to predict return to baseline IIEF-EF and to predict OS defined according to the IIEF-OS in the overall population. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze OS in men who reached the back to baseline status.  Main outcome measures:   The outcome of the study was to evaluate back to baseline EF status and to correlate it with postoperative OS.  Results:   Preoperative satisfaction was reported by 218 (33.4%) patients. Postoperative satisfaction was achieved by 103 patients. Overall, 383 patients were able to achieve the preoperative IIEF-EF score. However, only 26.9% reported being satisfied. Age and preoperative IIEF-EF score were significantly associated with baseline IIEF-EF recovery (all P ≤ .02). Patients who were able to return to baseline IIEF-EF were more likely to be satisfied (P < .001). Time elapsed between surgery and achievement of baseline IIEF-EF was significantly associated with OS (P < .001). Among patients who were able to achieve the baseline IIEF-EF score, a preoperative IIEF-EF of 22-25 and 26-30 was significantly associated with postoperative satisfaction (all P < .001).  Conclusion:   After BNSRP, reaching the baseline IIEF-EF score is not always sufficient to obtain patient satisfaction. Only patients with a preoperative IIEF-EF ≥22 who reached the baseline score after surgery considered themselves satisfied.

The mp-MRI was performed to define the likelihood of malignancy according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score (1-5). Patients were divided in 2 groups: non-visible cancer lesion on MRI (PIRADS 2-3) and visible cancer (PIRADS 4-5). Preoperative clinical data (age, body mass index, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, positive core biopsy, PSA density (PSAD)) and definitive pathological findings (staging, upgrading, unfavorable disease) were compared between groups. PIRADS score was correlated with pathological data to evaluate the prognostic role of mp-MRI; and preoperative variables and definitive pathology (upgrading, upstaging and unfavorable disease) were also assessed.  Results:   PSAD (p = 0.04) and pathological stage (p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the presence of visible disease. Visible disease was significantly associated with upstaging (p = 0.03). Correlation between PIRADS 5 and unfavorable disease was statistically significant (p = 0.02).

Negative predictive value was higher for upstaging than for upgrading or unfavorable disease (96 vs. 68% and 64%). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that PIRADS 5 was a significant predictor of upstaging (p = 0.05, OR 16.12) and unfavorable disease (p = 0.01, OR 6.53).

Preclinical and clinical research suggest that hypofractionation-fewer treatments but at a higher dose per treatment-may produce similar outcomes. This trial was designed to assess whether the efficacy of a hypofractionated radiotherapy (H-RT) treatment schedule is no worse than a C-RT schedule in men with low-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   A total of 1,115 men with low-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to C-RT (73.8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8.2 weeks) or to H-RT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks). This trial was designed to establish (with 90% power and an α of .05) that treatment with H-RT results in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) that is not worse than C-RT by more than 7.65% (H-RT/C-RT hazard ratio [HR] < 1.52).  Results:   A total of 1,092 men were protocol eligible and had follow-up information; 542 patients were assigned to C-RT and 550 to H-RT. Median follow-up was 5.8 years.

The purpose of this randomized phase II trial was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of short-course ADT with or without bevacizumab in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients had an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of ≤ 50 ng/mL and PSA doubling time of less than 18 months. Patients had either no metastases or low burden, asymptomatic metastases (lymph nodes < 3 cm and five or fewer bone metastases). Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, bicalutamide and bevacizumab or ADT alone, for 6 months. The primary end point was PSA relapse-free survival (RFS). Relapse was defined as a PSA of more than 0.2 ng/mL for prostatectomy patients or PSA of more than 2.0 ng/mL for primary radiation therapy patients.  Results:   Sixty-six patients received ADT + bevacizumab and 36 received ADT alone. Patients receiving ADT + bevacizumab had a statistically significant improvement in RFS compared with patients treated with ADT alone (13.3 months for ADT + bevacizumab v 10.2 months for ADT alone; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77; log-rank P = .002). Hypertension was the most common adverse event in patients receiving ADT + bevacizumab (36%).

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on clinical prostate cancer samples. Silencing SATB1 inhibited the growth of DU-145 cells subcutaneous tumor in nude mice, while SATB1 overexpression promoted the growth of LNCaP cells subcutaneous tumor in nude mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of the xenografts showed that silencing SATB1 led to decreased expression of vimentin and MMP2 and increased expression of E-cadherin, while SATB1 overexpression led to increased expression of vimentin and MMP2 and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, SATB1, vimentin and MMP2 expression was increased significantly while E-cadherin expression was reduced significantly in clinical samples of prostate carcinoma with metastasis compared to prostate carcinoma without metastasis and benign prostate hyperplasia.

A reassessment of diverse ILs fine-structure micrographs obtained out of previous studies encompassing the human prostate carcinoma (DU145) cell line and xenotransplanted carcinomas enabled us to propose aspects of ILs development in cancer cells: a combination of altered expressions in intercellular contacts and their cytoskeletal components would favor a disarray of self-apical polarity orientation; those defects, associated with a local, entwined enriched membranous structures growing as microvilli-like formations out of a disrupted endoplasm and trans-Golgi sorting, create ILs in cells' perikarya. These misplaced intracytoplasmic domains can become enlarged through spaces made between the finger-like structures by accruing membranes of coalescent intracytoplasmic vesicles then adding microvilli and glycocalyx to constitute ILs. Cationic mucins added with or without a progressive or total loss of microvilli and content generate signet or ring cell, while ILs enlarge. Variable build-ups of these cells' populations in carcinomas result in architectural mix-up of adjacent cells around these voids, misconstrued as new lumen, and establish a ""cribriform"" tumor pattern that often implies a poor cancer prognosis.

Rate advancement periods (RAPs) may enhance communication of smoking related risk to the general population. Thus, we estimated RAPs for the association of smoking exposure (smoking status, time since smoking cessation, smoking intensity, and duration) with total and site-specific (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and pancreatic) cancer incidence and mortality.  Methods:   This is a meta-analysis of 19 population-based prospective cohort studies with individual participant data for 897,021 European and American adults. For each cohort we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for the association of smoking exposure with cancer outcomes using Cox regression adjusted for a common set of the most important potential confounding variables. RAPs (in years) were calculated as the ratio of the logarithms of the HRs for a given smoking exposure variable and age. Meta-analyses were employed to summarize cohort-specific HRs and RAPs.  Results:   Overall, 140,205 subjects had a first incident cancer, and 53,164 died from cancer, during an average follow-up of 12 years. Current smoking advanced the overall risk of developing and dying from cancer by eight and ten years, respectively, compared with never smokers. The greatest advancements in cancer risk and mortality were seen for lung cancer and the least for breast cancer. Smoking cessation was statistically significantly associated with delays in the risk of cancer development and mortality compared with continued smoking.  Conclusions:   This investigation shows that smoking, even among older adults, considerably advances, and cessation delays, the risk of developing and dying from cancer.

To obtain causal estimates, we examined the role of pubertal development in prostate cancer using genetic polymorphisms associated with Tanner stage in adolescent boys in a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.  Methods:   We derived a weighted genetic risk score for pubertal development, combining 13 SNPs associated with male Tanner stage. A higher score indicated a later puberty onset. We examined the association of this score with prostate cancer risk, stage and grade in the UK-based ProtecT case-control study (n = 2,927), and used the PRACTICAL consortium (n = 43,737) as a replication sample.  Results:   In ProtecT, the puberty genetic score was inversely associated with prostate cancer grade (odds ratio (OR) of high- vs. low-grade cancer, per tertile of the score: 0.76; 95 % CI, 0.64-0.89). In an instrumental variable estimation of the causal OR, later physical development in adolescence (equivalent to a difference of one Tanner stage between pubertal boys of the same age) was associated with a 77 % (95 % CI, 43-91 %) reduced odds of high Gleason prostate cancer. In PRACTICAL, the puberty genetic score was associated with prostate cancer stage (OR of advanced vs. localized cancer, per tertile: 0.95; 95 % CI, 0.91-1.00) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio amongst cases, per tertile: 0.94; 95 % CI, 0.90-0.98), but not with disease grade.

Sulfasalazine (SSZ), a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits glutamate-cystine transport, and suppressed CD44v-dependent tumor growth and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs in an in vivo study. Here, we present two cases of CD44v9-positive urogenital cancer with concomitant treatment with SSZ for RA. Patient 1 was a 62-year-old man who had received SSZ for RA beginning 2 months before the diagnosis of urinary bladder cancer. Although he had multiple metastases to the bladder, abdominal, left cervical and left axillary lymph nodes, and brain, complete response with multidisciplinary therapy was maintained for more than 2 years. Patient 2 was a 74-year-old man with castration-resistant prostate cancer who was diagnosed with RA during chemotherapy and a gradual increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When SSZ was added, his PSA value (ng/mL) decreased from 12.93 to 5.58 in only 2 weeks and then quickly rebounded, whereas levels of neuron-specific enolase, a neuroendocrine differentiator and CSC marker, remained almost unchanged.

Genetically engineered mouse models have demonstrated that both basal and luminal cells can serve as cells of origin for prostate cancer. Using a human prostate regeneration and transformation assay, our group previously demonstrated that basal cells can serve as efficient targets for transformation. Recently, a subpopulation of multipotent human luminal cells defined by CD26 expression that retains progenitor activity in a defined organoid culture was identified. We transduced primary human prostate basal and luminal cells with lentiviruses expressing c-Myc and activated AKT1 (myristoylated AKT1 or myrAKT1) to mimic theMYCamplification andPTENloss commonly detected in human prostate cancer. These cells were propagated in organoid culture before being transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We found that c-Myc/myrAKT1-transduced luminal xenografts exhibited histological features of well-differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma, with strong androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression. In contrast, c-Myc/myrAKT1-transduced basal xenografts were histologically more aggressive, with a loss of acinar structures and low/absent AR and PSA expression. Our findings imply that distinct subtypes of prostate cancer may arise from luminal and basal epithelial cell types subjected to the same oncogenic insults. This study provides a platform for the functional evaluation of oncogenes in basal and luminal epithelial populations of the human prostate. Tumors derived in this fashion with defined genetics can be used in the preclinical development of targeted therapeutics.""","""['Jung Wook Park', 'John K Lee', 'John W Phillips', 'Patrick Huang', 'Donghui Cheng', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Owen N Witte']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Identification of a cell of origin for human prostate cancer.', 'Developing a Novel Two-Dimensional Culture System to Enrich Human Prostate Luminal Progenitors that Can Function as a Cell of Origin for Prostate Cancer.', 'Conditionally ablated Pten in prostate basal cells promotes basal-to-luminal differentiation and causes invasive prostate cancer in mice.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'The molecular and cellular origin of human prostate cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'Overview of Trop-2 in Cancer: From Pre-Clinical Studies to Future Directions in Clinical Settings.', 'Novel Paired Normal Prostate and Prostate Cancer Model Cell Systems Derived from African American Patients.', 'Novel Insights into the Role of the Antioxidants in Prostate Pathology.']"""

Objective:   To identify clinician characteristics associated with PSA screening rates in older veterans stratified by life expectancy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cross-sectional study of 826 286 veterans 65 years or older eligible for PSA screening who had VA laboratory tests performed in 2011 in the VA health care system.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the percentage of men with a screening PSA test in 2011. Limited life expectancy was defined as age of at least 85 years with Charlson comorbidity score of 1 or greater or age of at least 65 years with Charlson comorbidity score of 4 or greater. Primary predictors were clinician characteristics including degree-training level, specialty, age, and sex. We performed log-linear Poisson regression models for the association between each clinician characteristic and PSA screening stratified by patient life expectancy and adjusted for patient demographics and clinician clustering.  Results:   In 2011, 466 017 (56%) of older veterans received PSA screening, including 39% of the 203 717 men with limited life expectancy. After adjusting for patient demographics, higher PSA screening rates in patients with limited life expectancy was associated with having a clinician who was an older man and was no longer in training. The PSA screening rates ranged from 27% for men with a physician trainee to 42% for men with an attending physician (P < .001); 22% for men with a geriatrician to 82% for men with a urologist as their clinician (P < .001); 29% for men with a clinician 35 years or younger to 41% for those with a clinician 56 years or older (P < .001); and 38% for men with a female clinician older than 55 years vs 43% for men with a male clinician older than 55 years (P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   More than one-third of men with limited life expectancy received PSA screening. Men whose clinician was a physician trainee had substantially lower PSA screening rates than those with an attending physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.

Oxidative stress is a conceivable link between diet and diseases, thus food antioxidants, counteracting the damage caused by oxidation, are potential tools for fight age-related diseases and cancer. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic antioxidant from grapes, has gained enormous attention particularly because of its ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, and it has been proposed as both chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for cancer and other diseases. Even though the effects of RSV have been studied in prostate cancer cells and animal models, little is known about its effects on normal cells and tissues. To address this issue, we have investigated the effects of RSV on EPN cells, a human non-transformed prostate cell line, focusing on the relationship between RSV and p66Shc, a redox enzyme whose activities strikingly intersect those of RSV. p66Shc activity is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 36 (Ser36) and has been related to mitochondrial oxidative stress, apoptosis induction, regulation of cell proliferation and migration. Here we show that RSV inhibits adhesion, proliferation and migration of EPN cells, and that these effects are associated to induction of dose- and time-dependent p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 de-phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that RSV is able to activate also p52Shc, another member of the Shc protein family. These data show that RSV affects non-transformed prostate epithelial cells and suggest that Shc proteins may be key contributors of RSV effects on prostate cells.""","""['A Conte', 'C Procaccini', 'P Iannelli', 'A Kisslinger', 'F De Amicis', 'G M Pierantoni', 'F P Mancini', 'G Matarese', 'D Tramontano']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Transl Med UniSa""","""['Resveratrol regulates p66Shc activation in HaCaT cells.', 'Convergent Effects of Resveratrol and PYK2 on Prostate Cells.', 'The p66Shc protein controls redox signaling and oxidation-dependent DNA damage in human liver cells.', 'p66Shc as a switch in bringing about contrasting responses in cell growth: implications on cell proliferation and apoptosis.', 'Synergistic effect of resveratrol and radiotherapy in control of cancers.', 'A Notch inhibitor plus Resveratrol induced blockade of autophagy drives glioblastoma cell death by promoting a switch to apoptosis.', 'Grape Powder Supplementation Attenuates Prostate Neoplasia Associated with Pten Haploinsufficiency in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet.', 'Natural products and phytochemical nanoformulations targeting mitochondria in oncotherapy: an updated review on resveratrol.', 'Double knock-out of Hmga1 and Hipk2 genes causes perinatal death associated to respiratory distress and thyroid abnormalities in mice.', 'Steroid Receptor Signallings as Targets for Resveratrol Actions in Breast and Prostate Cancer.']"""

Lipid biosynthesis has been predicted to be an essential process in cancer cells. However, it is unclear which enzymes within this pathway offer the best selectivity for cancer cells and could be suitable therapeutic targets.  Results:   Using functional genomics, we identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that controls synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, as essential in breast and prostate cancer cells. SCD inhibition altered cellular lipid composition and impeded cell viability in the absence of exogenous lipids. SCD inhibition also altered cardiolipin composition, leading to the release of cytochrome C and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, SCD was required for the generation of poly-unsaturated lipids in cancer cells grown in spheroid cultures, which resemble those found in tumour tissue. We also found that SCD mRNA and protein expression is elevated in human breast cancers and predicts poor survival in high-grade tumours. Finally, silencing of SCD in prostate orthografts efficiently blocked tumour growth and significantly increased animal survival.  Conclusions:   Our data implicate lipid desaturation as an essential process for cancer cell survival and suggest that targeting SCD could efficiently limit tumour expansion, especially under the metabolically compromised conditions of the tumour microenvironment.""","""['Barrie Peck#', 'Zachary T Schug#', 'Qifeng Zhang', 'Beatrice Dankworth', 'Dylan T Jones', 'Elizabeth Smethurst', 'Rachana Patel', 'Susan Mason', 'Ming Jiang', 'Rebecca Saunders', 'Michael Howell', 'Richard Mitter', 'Bradley Spencer-Dene', 'Gordon Stamp', 'Lynn McGarry', 'Daniel James', 'Emma Shanks', 'Eric O Aboagye', 'Susan E Critchlow', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Adrian L Harris', 'Michael J O Wakelam', 'Eyal Gottlieb', 'Almut Schulze']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Metab""","""['Cancer cell dependence on unsaturated fatty acids implicates stearoyl-CoA desaturase as a target for cancer therapy.', '17β-estradiol induces stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.', 'PDGF-induced fibroblast growth requires monounsaturated fatty acid production by stearoyl-CoA desaturase.', 'Lipid desaturation - the next step in targeting lipogenesis in cancer?', 'Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and adaptive stress signaling.', 'Exploring breast tissue microbial composition and the association with breast cancer risk factors.', 'Tumor metabolism rewiring in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 as a Therapeutic Biomarker: Focusing on Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Free ferrous ions sustain activity of mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1.', 'Preliminary Analysis of the Glycolipid Profile in Secondary Brain Tumors.']"""

The secondary objective was to determine the impact the potential changes would have on a patient's treatment.  Materials and methods:   Dedicated genitourinary pathologists reviewed 1191 transurethral biopsies of the bladder and/or prostatic urethra from 2008 to 2013. Major and minor treatment changes were defined as altering recommendations for cystectomy, systemic chemotherapy, or primary cancer diagnosis, and alterations in intravesical regimens, respectively.  Results:   There were 326/1191 patients (27.4%) with a pathologic change on second opinion: grade (62/1191, 5.2%), stage (115/1191, 9.7%), muscle in the specimen (29/1191, 2.4%), presence or absence of carcinoma in situ (34/1191, 2.9%). Outside pathology did not address the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion in 620/759 (81.7%) of invasive cases (≥cT1), of which 35/620 (5.6%) had lymphovascular invasion. There were 212 mixed, variant, or nonurothelial histologies detected in 199/1191 (16.7%) patients, with 114/212 (53.7%) resulting in reclassification by our pathologists. Potential treatment alterations accounted for 182/1191 (15.3%) of cases, with 141/1191 (11.8%) imparting major changes. There were 82/1191 (6.8%) changes in recommendation for a radical cystectomy, 38/1191 (3.2%) had a complete change in primary tumor type, and 21/1191 (1.8%) for change in chemotherapy regimen.  Conclusion:   The amount and degree of pathologic changes and its potential impact on treatment emphasize the importance of bladder cancer patients having their histology reviewed by genitourinary-dedicated pathologists.

Methods:   Patients with advanced cancer of the bladder, brain, breast, colon/rectum, head/neck, hepatobiliary tract/pancreas, kidney, lung, lymphoma, ovary, or prostate completed the EQ-5D and FACT-G. HRQL domains and summary scores were compared across types of cancer, using regression models to adjust for age and sex.  Findings:   Approximately 50 patients with each type of cancer were recruited (total, 534 patients). According to EQ-5D dimensions, the highest proportion of problems was associated with prostate (mobility); prostate and kidney (self-care); head/neck, bladder, and lung (usual activities); breast, head/neck, and lung (pain/discomfort); and lymphoma and lung (anxiety/depression) cancers. EQ-5D visual analogue scale scores were lowest for breast and head/neck cancers; US index-based scores were lowest for breast and lung cancers and highest for brain cancer. For the FACT-G, physical well-being scores were lowest for head/neck, hepatobiliary, and kidney cancers; emotional well-being scores were lowest for hepatobiliary cancer, and functional well-being scores were lowest for head/neck, hepatobiliary, and bladder cancers.

Expression level of active p-Akt in PC3 cells was upregulated by transient expression with constitutively active plasmid CA-Akt or, alternatively, suppressed by dominant negative construct DN-Akt. NF-κB activity was determined by luciferase reporter assays. mRNA and protein expressions of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) were evaluated using RT-PCR and Western blotting. The effect of cross-talk between PC3 and SaOS2 cells on cell proliferation was analyzed using a co-culture system. Stimulation of p-Akt promoted NF-κB activity, and led to an increase in mRNA and protein expressions of RANKL, PTHrP, and BMP-2 in PC3 PCa cells through NF-κB. Co-culturing PC3 and SaOS2 cells significantly increased the expression of p-Akt and the activity of NF-κB, and promoted proliferation of both PC3 and SaOS2 cells. Increasing expression levels of p-Akt by transfection with CA-Akt led to further increase in cells proliferation, whereas NF-κB inhibitor PDTC partially blocked this effect. PI3K/Akt pathway stimulates the expressions of RANKL, PTHrP, and BMP-2 partly through NF-κB, suggesting its importance for bone metastasis of prostate carcinoma.

Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge of pre-treatment prognostic factors for response to ADT. Recently, microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been reported to play an important role in development of castration resistance of CaP. However, little is known about the expression of miR-21 in advanced PCa biopsy tissues, and data on its potential predictive value in advanced PCa are completely lacking.  Methods:   In this study, paraffin-embedded prostate carcinoma tissues obtained by needle biopsy from 85 advanced PCa patients were evaluated for the expression levels of miR-21 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis was performed to further confirm the qRT-PCR results. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the correlation between miR-21 expression and time to progression of advanced PCa patients.  Results:   Compared with adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues, the expression level of miR-21 was significantly increased in PCa tissues (PCa vs. non-cancerous prostate: 1.3273 ± 0.3207 vs. 0.9970 ± 0.2054, P < 0.001). By and large, in ISH analysis miR-21 was expressed at a higher level in tumor areas than in adjacent non-cancerous areas. Additionally, PCa patients with higher expression of miR-21 were significantly more likely to be of high Gleason score and high clinical stage (P < 0.05). There was no significant association between miR-21 expression and the initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or age at diagnosis. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis found that PCa patients with high miR-21 expression have shorter progression-free survival than those with low miR-21 expression. Furthermore, Multivariate Cox analysis revealed both miR-21 expression status (P = 0.040) and clinical stage (P = 0.042) were all independent predictive factor for progression-free survival for advanced PCa.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest for the first time that the up-regulation of miR-21 may serve as an independent predictor of progress-free survival in patients with advanced PCa.

We examined the magnitude of prostatic bleeding and frequency after biopsies and the relationship with oncological outcomes.  Materials and methods:   A total of 285 patients were selected for the final analyses. Inclusion criteria were as follows: receiving MRI three weeks after biopsiesand laparoscopic radical prostatectomy within 300 days after biopsy. We divided the patients into two groups with (group A) or without (group B) prostatic bleeding. We examined the magnitude of prostatic bleeding after biopsies and the relationship with operation time (OT), positive surgical margin (PSM), biochemical recurrence (BCR) and other factors. Furthermore, we created a logistic-regression model to derive a propensity score for prostatic bleeding after biopsies, which included all patient and hospital characteristics as well as selected interaction terms, and we examined the relationship with PSM and BCR.  Results:   In all patients, the OT in the group B was shorter than the group A (p < 0.001). Prostatic bleeding was associated with PSM (p=0.000) and BCR (p=0.036). In this propensity-matched cohort, 11 of 116 patients in the group B had PSM as compared with 36 of 116 patients from group A (match-adjusted odds ratio, 4.30; 95%CI confidence interval, 2.06 to 8.96; P=0.000).

In this study, we determined antiproliferative properties of a seed extract of PG (PSE) from Iran in different human cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   A methanolic extract of pomegranate seeds was prepared. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were assessed by colorimetric assays. Antioxidant activity was determined with reference to DPPH radical scavenging activity. The cytotoxicity of different doses of PSE (0, 5, 20, 100, 250, 500, 1000 μg/ml) was evaluated by MTT assays with A549 (lung non small cell carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), SKOV3 (ovarian cancer cells), and PC-3 (prostate adenocarcinoma) cells.  Results:   Significant (P<0.01) or very significant (P<0.0001) differences were observed in comparison to negative controls at all tested doses (5-1000 μg/ml). In all studied cancer cells, PSE reduced the cell viability to values below 23%, even at the lowest doses. In all cases, IC50 was determined at doses below 5 μg/ml. In this regard, SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells were the most responsive to antiproliferative effects of PSE with a maximum mean growth inhibition of 86.8% vs. 82.8%, 81.4% and 80.0% in MCF-7, PC-3 and A549 cells, respectively.  Conclusions:   Low doses of PSE exert potent antiproliferative effects on different human cancer cells SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells as most and A549 cells ar least responsive regarding cytotoxic effects.

We used data from the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) to further examine this association.  Methods:   Patients with a first-time diagnosis of IBD were randomly matched to an equally sized IBD-free comparison group. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for cancer risk were estimated using Cox's proportional hazard regression. A nested case-control analysis comprising IBD patients only was then conducted using conditional logistic regression to estimate the risk of cancer development according to IBD severity, disease duration and IBD therapy.  Results:   We identified 1077 cancers among 39,294 IBD or IBD-free patients followed between 1995 and 2012. There was no association between IBD and overall risk of cancer [AHR 1.11, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.25], but a borderline increase in the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancies was observed in patients with IBD (AHR 1.49, 95 % CI 1.00-2.23).

Conclusions:   There was no increased risk of cancer overall in individuals with IBD compared to IBD-free individuals. Consistent with previous findings, a reduction in cancer risk was observed in IBD patients using aminosalicylates, with a substantial reduction in prostate cancer risk.

Cell lines are frequently used as models to study mitochondrial (dys)function, but little is known about their mitochondrial respiration and metabolic properties in comparison to the primary tissue of origin. We have developed a method for assessment of oxidative phosphorylation in prostate tissue samples of only 2 mg wet weight using high-resolution respirometry. Reliable protocols were established to investigate the respiratory activity of different segments of the mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) in mechanically permeabilized tissue biopsies. Additionally, the widely used immortalized prostate epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, RWPE1 and NAF, representing the major cell types in prostate tissue, were analyzed and compared to the tissue of origin. Our results show that mechanical treatment without chemical permeabilization agents or sample processing constitutes a reliable preparation method for OXPHOS analysis in small amounts of prostatic tissue typically obtained by prostate biopsy. The cell lines represented the bioenergetic properties of fresh tissue to a limited extent only. Particularly, tissue showed a higher oxidative capacity with succinate and glutamate, whereas pyruvate was a substrate supporting significantly higher respiratory activities in cell lines. Several fold higher zinc levels measured in tissue compared to cells confirmed the role of aconitase for prostate-specific metabolism in agreement with observed respiratory properties. In conclusion, combining the flexibility of cell culture models and tissue samples for respirometric analysis are powerful tools for investigation of mitochondrial function and tissue-specific metabolism.""","""['Bernd Schöpf', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Anja Weber', 'Heribert Talasz', 'Iris E Eder', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Erich Gnaiger']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['High-Resolution FluoRespirometry and OXPHOS Protocols for Human Cells, Permeabilized Fibers from Small Biopsies of Muscle, and Isolated Mitochondria.', 'High-resolution respirometry: OXPHOS protocols for human cells and permeabilized fibers from small biopsies of human muscle.', 'Capacity of oxidative phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle: new perspectives of mitochondrial physiology.', 'High-throughput assay to measure oxygen consumption in digitonin-permeabilized cells of patients with mitochondrial disorders.', 'Energy metabolism in muscle approaching maximal rates of oxygen utilization.', 'Mitochondrial impairment but not peripheral inflammation predicts greater Gulf War illness severity.', 'Caffeine improves mitochondrial function in PINK1B9-null mutant Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Enhanced Succinate Oxidation with Mitochondrial Complex II Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Physiological Cell Culture Media Tune Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Cell Models.', 'Multiple metabolic pathways fuel the truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle of the prostate to sustain constant citrate production and secretion.']"""

The goal of the current project is to further characterize the biologic properties of TM(+) prostate cancer cell population, particularly in the context of initiating and propagating castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Experimental design:   The in vivo CSC activities were measured by limiting-dilution serial tumor transplantation assays in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer xenograft models. In vitro clonal, clonogenic, and sphere-formation assays were conducted in cells purified from xenograft and patient tumors. qPCR, Western blot, lentiviral-mediated gene knockdown, and human microRNA arrays were performed for mechanistic studies.  Results:   By focusing on the LAPC9 model, we show that the TM(+) cells are CSCs with both tumor-initiating and tumor-propagating abilities for CRPC. Moreover, primary patient samples have TM(+) cells, which possess CSC activities in ""castrated"" culture conditions. Mechanistically, we find that (i) the phenotypic markers are causally involved in CRPC development; (ii) the TM(+) cells preferentially express castration resistance and stem cell-associated molecules that regulate their CSC characteristics; and (iii) the TM(+) cells possess distinct microRNA expression profiles and miR-499-5p functions as an oncomir.  Conclusions:   Our results define the TM(+) prostate cancer cells as a population of preexistent stem-like cancer cells that can both mediate and propagate CRPC and highlight the TM(+) cell population as a therapeutic target.

Only a few studies have explored the link between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use and prostate cancer. We tested the association between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor and prostate cancer risk in the REDUCE (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) trial.  Materials and methods:   REDUCE was a 4-year multicenter study testing the effect of daily dutasteride on prostate cancer risk in men with prostate specific antigen 2.5 to 10.0 ng/ml and negative biopsy who underwent study mandated biopsies at 2 and 4 years. The association of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor with overall prostate cancer risk and disease grade (Gleason 2-6 and 7-10) was examined using adjusted logistic and multinomial regression analysis. Secondary analysis was performed to explore the association between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor and prostate cancer risk in North American men, given the significantly higher use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in these subjects.  Results:   Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor was not associated with prostate cancer diagnosis (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.20, p = 0.476), low grade disease (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67-1.27, p = 0.632) or high grade disease (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51-1.39, p = 0.508). An inverse trend was seen between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor and prostate cancer diagnosis in North American men but this was not statistically significant (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42-1.07, p = 0.091).  Conclusions:   Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use was not associated with decreased prostate cancer diagnoses on post-hoc analysis of REDUCE.

Recent studies have shown a national decline in prostate specific antigen testing following the USPSTF (United States Preventive Services Task Force) recommendation against routine prostate specific antigen screening. However, to our knowledge the effect of this recommendation on digital rectal examination utilization remains unknown.  Materials and methods:   We used NAMCS (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) to characterize trends in the rate of digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen testing by primary care physicians in men older than 40 years presenting for preventive care. From 2005 to 2012 NAMCS contained 3,368 such visits (unweighted) for the study of digital rectal examination trends and 4,035 unweighted visits from 2002 to 2012 for the study of prostate specific antigen trends.  Results:   Following the USPSTF recommendation the proportion of visits where digital rectal examination was performed decreased from 16.0% (95% CI 13.1-19.5) to 5.8% (95% CI 4.0-8.3, p <0.001). Similarly, the proportion of visits where prostate specific antigen testing was performed decreased from 27.3% (95% CI 24.5-30.3) to 16.7% (95% CI 12.9-21.2, p <0.001). This represents a relative 64% decrease in digital rectal examination and a 39% decrease in prostate specific antigen testing. Among men 55 to 69 years old the number of visits where digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen testing were performed decreased 65% and 39%, respectively (p <0.001).  Conclusions:   Utilization of digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen has declined significantly following the release of the USPSTF recommendation against prostate specific antigen screening.

The prostate consists of cellular tissue surrounding fluid filled ducts. Here, the diffusion properties of the ductal fluid alone were studied. Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate ductal residence times to determine whether ducts can be regarded as forming a separate compartment and whether ductal radius could determine the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) of the ductal fluid.  Methods:   Random walks were simulated in cavities. Average residence times were estimated for permeable cavities. Signal reductions resulting from application of a Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence were calculated in impermeable cavities. Simulations were repeated for cavities of different radii and different diffusion times.  Results:   Residence times are at least comparable with diffusion times even in relatively high grade tumors. ADCs asymptotically approach theoretical limiting values. At large radii and short diffusion times, ADCs are similar to free diffusion. At small radii and long diffusion times, ADCs are reduced toward zero, and kurtosis approaches a value of -1.2.  Conclusions:   Restricted diffusion in cavities of similar sizes to prostate ducts may reduce ductal ADCs. This may contribute to reductions in total ADC seen in prostate cancer.

Postoperative parameters reviewed included length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative ileus, fistulas, urinary retention and hematoma formation. Surgical outcomes reviewed included pathological stage and combined Gleason score. Patient age, BMI, mean combined Gleason score and pathological stage were similar in both groups. Mean OT for the LPP group was 105.49 (66-166) and for the standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (SPP) group 111.31 (61-231) min. The length of stay in both groups was similar, averaging 1.53 (1-6) days for the LPP group and 1.57 (1-6) days for the SPP group. The LPP group had a lower postop ileus rate of 4 vs 8 % in the SPP group, but they were not statistically different. Likewise, the positive margin rate, readmission rate, hematoma rate, retention rate and urinary fistula rate were similar and not statistically different for both groups. Pneumoperitoneum of 12 mmHg is noninferior to 15 mmHg during RARP and does not alter the clinical outcomes.""","""['Cody R Christensen', 'Thomas K Maatman', 'Thomas J Maatman', 'Tony T Tran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Reduction in postoperative ileus rates utilizing lower pressure pneumoperitoneum in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Feasibility of robot-assisted prostatectomy performed at ultra-low pneumoperitoneum pressure of 6\xa0mmHg and comparison of clinical outcomes vs standard pressure of 15\xa0mmHg.', 'The impact of low pressure pneumoperitoneum in robotic assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective, randomized, double blinded trial.', 'Lower vs standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'The Impact of intra-abdominal Pressure on Perioperative Outcomes in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'The effect of different levels of pneumoperitoneum pressures on regional cerebral oxygenation during robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted perineal versus transperitoneal radical prostatectomy: A matched-pair analysis.', 'Reduction in postoperative ileus rates utilizing lower pressure pneumoperitoneum in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   This study defined the patterns of palliative care delivery using a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced cancer within the SEER-Medicare linked database. We identified 83,022 patients with metastatic breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. We studied trends between 2000 through 2009, and determined patient-level and regional-level predictors of palliative care delivery.  Results:   Palliative care consultation rates increased from 3.0% in 2000 to 12.9% in 2009, with most consultations occurring in the last 4 weeks of life (77%) in the inpatient hospital setting. The rates of palliative care delivery were highest in the West (7.6%) and lowest in the South (3.2%). The likelihood of palliative care consultation increased with decreasing numbers of regional acute care hospital beds per capita. The use of palliative care consultation increased with increasing numbers of regional physicians. The use of palliative care decreased with increasing regional Medicare expenditure with a $1,387 difference per beneficiary between the first and fourth quartiles of palliative care use.

We determined whether the use of long-term ADT varied by the recently defined subcategories of high-risk disease (favorable, other, and very high) versus unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.  Methods:   We identified 5,524 patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2007 and managed with EBRT using the SEER-Medicare linked database. Patients were stratified by risk group: unfavorable intermediate-risk, favorable high-risk (previously defined and validated as clinical stage T1c, Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level <10 ng/mL, or clinical stage T1c, Gleason score of 6, and PSA level >20 ng/mL), very-high-risk (clinical stage T3b-T4 or primary Gleason pattern 5), or other high risk (ie, neither favorable nor very high). We used multivariable competing risks regression to estimate the rates of long-term (≥2 years) ADT by group.  Results:   Men with favorable high-risk prostate cancer were significantly less likely to receive long-term ADT than those with other high-risk disease (15.4% vs 24.6%, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60-0.76;P<.001), and similarly likely as those with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease (AHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.99-1.23;P=.087). Other high-risk disease was less likely to receive long-term ADT than very high-risk cancer (24.6% vs 30.8%; AHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93;P=.002).  Conclusions:   Despite current guidelines, patients with EBRT-managed high-risk prostate cancer received significantly different rates of long-course ADT based on subclassification.

Methods:   We use deep learning to analyze temporal ultrasound data obtained from 255 cancer foci identified in mp-MRI. Each target is sampled in axial and sagittal planes. A deep belief network is trained to automatically learn the high-level latent features of temporal ultrasound data. A support vector machine classifier is then applied to differentiate cancerous versus benign tissue, verified by histopathology. Data from 32 targets are used for the training, while the remaining 223 targets are used for testing.  Results:   Our results indicate that the distance between the biopsy target and the prostate boundary, and the agreement between axial and sagittal histopathology of each target impact the classification accuracy. In 84 test cores that are 5 mm or farther to the prostate boundary, and have consistent pathology outcomes in axial and sagittal biopsy planes, we achieve an area under the curve of 0.80. In contrast, all of these targets were labeled as moderately suspicious in mp-MR.  Conclusion:   Using temporal ultrasound data in a fusion prostate biopsy study, we achieved a high classification accuracy specifically for moderately scored mp-MRI targets. These targets are clinically common and contribute to the high false-positive rates associated with mp-MRI for prostate cancer detection.

Through secretion of growth factors, extracellular matrix deposition, and contractile mechanotransduction, myofibroblasts, or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), support angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The differentiation of fibroblasts to CAFs is primarily induced by TGF-β from cancer cells. To discover agents capable of blocking CAF differentiation, we developed a high content immunofluorescence-based assay to screen repurposed chemical libraries utilizing fibronectin expression as an initial CAF marker. Screening of the Prestwick chemical library and NIH Clinical Collection repurposed drug library, totaling over 1700 compounds, identified cardiac glycosides as particularly potent CAF blocking agents. Cardiac glycosides are traditionally used to regulate intracellular calcium by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase to control cardiac contractility. Herein, we report that multiple cardiac glycoside compounds, including digoxin, are able to inhibit TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression at low nanomolar concentrations without undesirable cell toxicity. We found this inhibition to hold true for multiple fibroblast cell lines. Using real-time qPCR, we determined that digoxin prevented induction of multiple CAF markers. Furthermore, we report that digoxin is able to prevent TGF-β-induced fibroblast contraction of extracellular matrix, a major phenotypic consequence of CAF differentiation. Assessing the mechanism of inhibition, we found digoxin reduced SMAD promoter activity downstream of TGF-β, and we provide data that the effect is through inhibition of its known target, the Na+/K+ ATPase. These findings support a critical role for calcium signaling during CAF differentiation and highlight a novel, repurposable modality for cancer therapy.""","""['David T Coleman', 'Alana L Gray', 'Charles A Stephens', 'Matthew L Scott', 'James A Cardelli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Regulation of myofibroblast differentiation by cardiac glycosides.', 'Targeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Human cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance glutathione levels and antagonize drug-induced prostate cancer cell death.', 'The transformation of cancer-associated fibroblasts: Current perspectives on the role of TGF-β in CAF mediated tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.', 'Versatility of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts: Commendable Targets for Anti-tumor Therapy.', 'Na+/K+‑ATPase subunit α3 expression is associated with the efficacy of digitoxin treatment in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.', 'Altered Calcium Influx Pathways in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.', 'The Nax (SCN7A) channel: an atypical regulator of tissue homeostasis and disease.', 'Antiviral drug screen identifies DNA-damage response inhibitor as potent blocker of SARS-CoV-2 replication.']"""

However, little is known about the patterns of αvβ3-expression in metastasized prostate cancer lesions in-vivo. Thus we evaluated the uptake of the αvβ3-specific PET tracer [18F]Galacto-RGD for assessment of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.  Results:   [18F]Galacto-RGD PET identified 58/74 bone-lesions (detection rate of 78.4%) and lymph node metastases in 2/5 patients. The SUVmean was 2.12+/-0.94 (range 0.70-4.38; tumor/blood 1.36+/-0.53; tumor/muscle 2.82+/-1.31) in bone-lesions and 2.21+/-1.18 (range 0.75-3.56) in lymph node metastases. Good visualization and detection of bone metastases was feasible due to a low background activity of the surrounding normal bone tissue.  Methods:   12 patients with known metastasized prostate cancer according to conventional staging (including bone-scintigraphy and contrast-enhanced CT; median PSA 68.63 ng/ml, range 3.72-1935) were examined with PET after i.v.-injection of [18F]Galacto-RGD. Two blinded nuclear-medicine physicians evaluated the PET-scans in consensus concerning lesion detectability. Volumes-of-interest were drawn in the PET-scans over all metastases defined by conventional staging (maximum of 11 lesions/patient), over the left ventricle, liver and muscle and standardized-uptake-values (SUVs) were calculated.  Conclusions:   Our data show generally elevated uptake of [18F]Galacto-RGD in bone metastases from prostate cancer with a marked inter- and intrapatient variability. While [18F]Galacto-RGD PET is inferior to bone scintigraphy for detection of osseous metastases, it might be valuable in patient screening and monitoring of αvβ3-targeted therapies due to the high variability of αvβ3-expression.""","""['Ambros J Beer', 'Sarah M Schwarzenböck', 'Niko Zantl', 'Michael Souvatzoglou', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Petra Watzlowik', 'Horst Kessler', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Bernd Joachim Krause']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Comparison of integrin alphaVbeta3 expression and glucose metabolism in primary and metastatic lesions in cancer patients: a PET study using 18F-galacto-RGD and 18F-FDG.', '18Fgalacto-RGD positron emission tomography for imaging of alphavbeta3 expression on the neovasculature in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.', 'Patterns of alphavbeta3 expression in primary and metastatic human breast cancer as shown by 18F-Galacto-RGD PET.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases with 18F-NaF and 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT.', 'Nuclear medicine studies of the prostate, testes, and bladder.', 'Targeted Molecular Imaging as a Biomarker in Urologic Oncology.', 'Preliminary Clinical Application of RGD-Containing Peptides as PET Radiotracers for Imaging Tumors.', ""It's Time to Shift the Paradigm: Translation and Clinical Application of Non-αvβ3 Integrin Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals."", 'Potential Targets Other Than PSMA for Prostate Cancer Theranostics: A Systematic Review.', 'Role of αVβ3 in Prostate Cancer: Metastasis Initiator and Important Therapeutic Target.']"""

This report examines cancer incidence and mortality based on residence in Contract Health Service Delivery Areas (CHSDA) to assess disparities between AIs/ANs and other racial populations in Wisconsin.  Methods:   To improve identification of the AI/AN race, incidence data were linked with Indian Health Service (IHS) patient records. Analysis further focused on residents of IHS CHSDA counties. Age-adjusted cancer incidence and mortality rates (2007-2011) were calculated by sex and major cancer sites. AI/AN rates were.analyzed for both statewide and CHSDA residency in comparison to statewide white rates and comparable national rates.  Results:   In comparison with whites, AI/ANs in CHSDA counties had higher incidence rates of cervical (3.5 times), liver (3.2), lung (2.3), and kidney cancers (2.1), and higher mortality rates for liver (2.7), kidney (2.2) and lung (1.9) cancers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to and tolerability of a single dose of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   The data of 82 consecutive patients (median age, 73 y; range, 43-87 y) with mCRPC who received a single dose of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 (mean, 5.9 ± 0.5 GBq) were retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected at baseline and 8 wk after therapy. (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was performed on all patients to verify sufficient PSMA expression. Bone, lymph node, liver, and lung metastases were present in 99%, 65%, 17%, and 11% of the patients, respectively. Tolerability and response were evaluated using hematologic parameters, renal scintigraphy, clinical data, and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at baseline and 8 wk after therapy application.  Results:   Six patients died, and 2 patients dropped out because they were not willing to continue therapy and follow-up. The complete dataset of 74 patients was available for analysis. Forty-seven patients (64%) showed a PSA decline, including 23 (31%) with a decline by more than 50%. Thirty-five patients (47%) had stable disease: the change in their PSA level ranged from less than a 50% decline to less than a 25% rise. Seventeen patients (23%) had progressive disease: their PSA level rose by more than 25%. There were no significant changes in hemoglobin, white blood cells, creatinine, or tubular extraction rates indicative of toxicity. There was a significant but mild decrease in platelets, but the median value was still within the reference range.  Conclusion:   This retrospective multicenter analysis suggests that radioligand therapy with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 is safe and well tolerated and has a considerable effect on PSA level. Therefore, it offers an additional therapeutic option for patients with mCRPC. These data may justify further prospective randomized studies to evaluate and prove the clinical benefit in terms of survival and quality of life.""","""['Kambiz Rahbar', 'Matthias Schmidt', 'Alexander Heinzel', 'Elisabeth Eppard', 'Axel Bode', 'Anna Yordanova', 'Michael Claesener', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Radioliganden-Therapie des metastasierten Prostatakarzinoms mit 177Lu-PSMA-617.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'German Multicenter Study Investigating 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients.', '177Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (LuPSMA trial): a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using Molecular-Targeted Therapy: Radioligand Lutetium-177 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Predictive and prognostic potential of pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA PET tumor heterogeneity index in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with 177Lu-PSMA.']"""

Whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can provide more information than TRUS-guided biopsy should be confirmed. Purpose To retrospectively assess the utility of ADC values in predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness, compared to the TRUS-guided prostate biopsy Gleason score (GS). Material and Methods The DW images of 54 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were obtained using 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR). The mean ADC values of cancerous areas and biopsy GS were correlated with prostatectomy GS and D'Amico clinical risk scores, respectively. Meanwhile, the utility of ADC values in identifying high-grade prostate cancer (with Gleason 4 and/or 5 components in prostatectomy) in patients with a biopsy GS ≤ 3 + 3 = 6 was also evaluated. Results A significant negative correlation was found between mean ADC values of cancerous areas and the prostatectomy GS ( P < 0.001) and D'Amico clinical risk scores ( P < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between biopsy GS and prostatectomy GS ( P = 0.140) and D'Amico clinical risk scores ( P = 0.342). Patients harboring Gleason 4 and/or 5 components in prostatectomy had significantly lower ADC values than those harboring no Gleason 4 and/or 5 components ( P = 0.004).

In particular, the data multitude in the Electronic Health Records poses interoperability issues and requires novel inference strategies. A problem, though apparently a paradox, is that highly specific treatments and a variety of outcomes may hardly match with consistent observations (i.e., large samples). Why is it the case? Owing to the heterogeneity of Electronic Health Records, models for the evaluation of treatment effects need to be selected, and in some cases, the use of instrumental variables might be necessary. We studied the recently defined person-centered treatment effects in cancer and C-section contexts from Electronic Health Record sources and identified as an instrument the distance of patients from hospitals. We present first the rationale for using such instrument and then its model implementation. While for cancer patients consideration of distance turns out to be a penalty, implying a negative effect on the probability of receiving surgery, a positive effect is instead found in C-section due to higher propensity of scheduling delivery. Overall, the estimated person-centered treatment effects reveal a high degree of heterogeneity, whose interpretation remains context-dependent. With regard to the use of instruments in light of our two case studies, our suggestion is that this process requires ad hoc variable selection for both covariates and instruments and additional testing to ensure validity.""","""['Luca Salmasi', 'Enrico Capobianco']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Stat Methods Med Res""","""['Assessment and statistical modeling of the relationship between remotely sensed aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 in the eastern United States.', 'Instrumental variables and inverse probability weighting for causal inference from longitudinal observational studies.', 'Some methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high dimensions.', 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.', 'Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Imprecise Data and Their Impact on Translational Research in Medicine.', 'The emerging landscape of health research based on biobanks linked to electronic health records: Existing resources, statistical challenges, and potential opportunities.', 'Predictive Assessment of Cancer Center Catchment Area from Electronic Health Records.']"""

It is hypothesized that this same in vivo phage selection technique can be used to functionally select for molecules that not only bind to cancer cells but also kill them. Here we analyzed two different in vivo phage display selected phage clones, G1 and H5, retrieved from PC-3 human prostate carcinoma xenografted tumors. First, cell de-attachment as an endpoint criterion for apoptosis and cell cycle was examined. After 2.5 hours incubation with G1 phage, PC-3 cell attachment was reduced by 23.8% and the percent of cell population in M phase reduced by 32.1%. In comparison, PC-3 cells incubated with H5 phage had a reduction of 25.0% cell attachment and 33.6% of cell population in M phase. These changes in combination with elevated caspase activation within cells in M phase, and no significant changes to G1/G0 or S phase cell populations suggest that the cytotoxic phages are targeting actively dividing PC-3 cells. Microscopic studies were also performed to further analyze the nature of cytotoxicity of these two phage clones. It was found that G1 phage induced and co- localized with tubulin based projections within apoptotic cells, while H5 phage did not.

Whether this had an impact on late toxicity levels compared to previously applied three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) is currently unknown. We analyzed late side effects after treatment with IG-IMRT or 3D-CRT, evaluating 2 prospective cohorts of men treated for localized prostate cancer to investigate the hypothesized reductions in toxicity.  Methods and materials:   Patients treated with 3D-CRT (n=189) or IG-IMRT (n=242) to 78 Gy in 39 fractions were recruited from 2 Dutch randomized trials with identical toxicity scoring protocols. Late toxicity (>90 days after treatment) was derived from self-assessment questionnaires and case report forms, according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG-EORTC) scoring criteria. Grade ≥2 endpoints included gastrointestinal (GI) rectal bleeding, increased stool frequency, discomfort, rectal incontinence, proctitis, and genitourinary (GU) obstruction, increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, and dysuria. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare grade ≥2 toxicities between both techniques, adjusting for other modifying factors.  Results:   The 5-year cumulative incidence of grade ≥2 GI toxicity was 24.9% for IG-IMRT and 37.6% following 3D-CRT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59, P=.005), with significant reductions in proctitis (HR: 0.37, P=.047) and increased stool frequency (HR: 0.23, P<.001). GU grade ≥2 toxicity levels at 5 years were comparable with 46.2% and 36.4% following IG-IMRT and 3D-CRT, respectively (adjusted HR: 1.19, P=.33). Other strong predictors (P<.01) of grade ≥2 late toxicity were baseline complaints, acute toxicity, and age.  Conclusions:   Treatment with IG-IMRT reduced the risk of late grade ≥2 complications, whereas GU toxicities remained comparable. This clinically relevant observation demonstrates that IMRT and image-guidance should therefore be the preferred treatment option, provided that margin reduction is implemented with caution.""","""['Ruud C Wortel', 'Luca Incrocci', 'Floris J Pos', 'Uulke A van der Heide', 'Joos V Lebesque', 'Shafak Aluwini', 'Marnix G Witte', 'Wilma D Heemsbergen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Comparison of combined IMRT and IGRT with conventional 3D-CRT in the irradiation of prostate cancer : Studying the advantages strongly depends on the conditions.', 'Acute toxicity after image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy compared to 3D conformal radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Incidence of late rectal and urinary toxicities after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Acute toxicity with intensity modulated radiotherapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy during preoperative chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.', 'Effects of gold fiducial marker implantation on tumor control and toxicity in external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'The role of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy and Toxicity of Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy Versus Prostate-Only Radiotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Salvage hypofractionated accelerated versus standard radiotherapy for the treatment of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (SHARE): the protocol of a prospective, randomized, open-label, superiority, multi-institutional trial.']"""

However, it is less clear how the relative risk varies by cause of death. The exact impact of changes in smoking habits throughout life on different mortality risks is less studied.  Methods:   We studied the impact of baseline and lifetime smoking habits, and duration of smoking on the risk of all-cause mortality, mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), any cancer and of the four most common types of cancer (lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer) in a cohort study (Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen 1965-1990, with a follow-up on mortality status until 2009, n = 8,645). We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, BMI, sex, and place of residence. Since previous studies suggested a potential effect modification of sex, we additionally stratified by sex and tested for interactions. In addition, to determine which cause of death carried the highest risk we performed competing-risk analyses on mortality due to CVD, cancer, COPD and other causes.  Results:   Current smoking (light, moderate, and heavy cigarette smoking) and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, and lung cancer mortality. Higher numbers of pack years at baseline were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer mortality. Males who were lifetime persistent pipe/cigar smokers had a higher risk of lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 7.72 (1.72-34.75)] as well as all-cause and any cancer mortality. A longer duration of smoking was associated with a higher risk of COPD, any and lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 1.06 (1.00-1.12), 1.03 (1.00-1.06) and 1.10 (1.03-1.17) respectively], but not with other mortality causes. The competing risk analyses showed that ex- and current smokers had a higher risk of cancer, CVD, and COPD mortality compared to all other mortality causes. In addition, heavy smokers had a higher risk for COPD mortality compared to cancer, and CVD mortality.  Conclusion:   Our study indicates that lifetime numbers of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking have different impacts for different causes of mortality. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of smoking-related competing risks when studying the smoking-related cancer mortality in a general population and that smoking cessation immediately effectively reduces the risk of all-cause and any cancer mortality.""","""['Niloofar Taghizadeh', 'Judith M Vonk', 'H Marike Boezen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Association of Cigarette, Cigar, and Pipe Use With Mortality Risk in the US Population.', 'Association between exclusive pipe smoking and mortality from cancer and other diseases.', 'Mortality and life expectancy in relation to long-term cigarette, cigar and pipe smoking: the Zutphen Study.', 'The effect of reducing the number of cigarettes smoked on risk of lung cancer, COPD, cardiovascular disease and FEV(1)--a review.', 'Improved patient outcome with smoking cessation: when is it too late?', 'Shared Lifestyle-Related Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer: Evidence for Joint Prevention.', 'Mortality was predicted by depression and functional dependence in a cohort of elderly adults of Italian descent from southern Brazil.', 'Health effects associated with smoking: a Burden of Proof study.', 'Validation of the PAM-13 instrument in the Hungarian general population 40\xa0years old and above.', 'Factors that Predict Smoking Cessation among Older Koreans: Based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016-2018.']"""

Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is an IL6-induced negative feedback regulator of the IL6/Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 pathway. This study reveals that the SOCS3 promoter is hypermethylated in cancerous regions compared with adjacent benign tissue in prostate cancer using methylation-specific qPCR. A series of in vitro experiments was performed to assess the functional impact of low SOCS3 expression during anti-androgen treatment. Using lentivirus-mediated knockdown, it was demonstrated for the first time that SOCS3 regulates IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP cells. In addition, SOCS3 mRNA is upregulated by the anti-androgens bicalutamide and enzalutamide. This effect is caused by androgen receptor-mediated suppression of IL6ST and JAK1 expression, which leads to altered STAT3 signaling. Functionally, knockdown of SOCS3 led to enhanced androgen receptor activity after 3 weeks of enzalutamide treatment in an inflammatory setting. Furthermore, the stemness/self-renewal associated genes SOX2 and NANOG were strongly upregulated by the long-term treatment, and modulation of SOCS3 expression was sufficient to counteract this effect. These findings prove that SOCS3 plays an important role during anti-androgen treatment in an inflammatory environment.  Implications:   SOCS3 is frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer, which disrupts the feedback regulation of IL6 signaling and leads to reduced efficacy of enzalutamide in the presence of inflammatory cytokines.

Our aims were to investigate the incidence and risk of BR in men on ACEIs/ARBs after radical radiotherapy with adjuvant∖neoadjuvant hormone treatment.  Material and methods:   A propensity score analysis of 558 men was conducted. Men were stratified into 3 groups: hypertensive men on ACEIs/ARBs (as a study group), non-hypertensive men not on ACEIs/ARBs, and hypertensive men not on ACEIs/ARBs (both as a control group). The multivariate analysis of variance, chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, analysis of variance, risk ratio, confidence interval, Kaplan-Meier plots, and log-rank tests were used.  Results:   The mean age and follow-up were 68.51 and 3.33 years, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of BR among the treatment groups (P < .001). The incidence of BR was significantly lower in hypertensive men taking ACEIs/ARBs than in non-hypertensive men not taking ACEIs/ARBs (P < .001) or in hypertensive men not taking ACEIs/ARBs (P < .009). The incidence of BR was significantly lower in hypertensive men not taking ACEIs/ARBs than in non-hypertensive men not taking ACEIs/ARBs (P < .013).

The dimensions and location of the TTMB core with the index lesion were placed within the 3-D ultrasound planning volume.

Varian has recently implemented an option for mARC-planning into the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) and so far mARC-planning with this TPS has not been evaluated systematically. Therefore, for prostate treatment with Eclipse we compare mARC with IMRT using flat (6MV) and flattening-filter-free (FFF, 7MV) beam energies.  Methods:   For ten prostate cancer patients standardized re-contouring and re-planning was performed with a prescription of 76Gy to the complete planning-target-volume (PTV). IMRT and mARC plans (6MV vs. FFF 7MV) were compared pairwise considering indices for plan quality. All plans were delivered on an anthromorphic phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters to measure out-of-field dose and treatment times.  Results:   Regarding PTV coverage, there was no marked preference for either technique or energy. The evaluation of organs at risk showed improved bladder sparing of the mARC plans up to about 75Gy; above this dose the IMRT plans achieved significant better sparing. The use of the FFF-beam-energy and mARC-technique resulted in a significant decrease in out-of-field dose. This combination also led to a drastic reduction of treatment time by factor of three in comparison with 6MV IMRT.  Conclusion:   While highly conformal treatment plans could be created by the use of all modalities, the combination of the high dose rate with mARC appears to be the preferable option as it benefits from a marked decrease in treatment time and out-of-field dose.""","""['Katharina Bell', 'Yvonne Dzierma', 'Jan Palm', 'Frank Nuesken', 'Norbert Licht', 'Christian Rübe']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['mARC vs. IMRT radiotherapy of the prostate with flat and flattening-filter-free beam energies.', 'mARC Treatment of Hypopharynx Carcinoma with Flat and Flattening-Filter-Free Beam Energies - A Planning Study.', 'Comparison of VMAT-SABR treatment plans with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) beam for localized prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of flattening-filter-free beam in stereotactic body radiation therapy planning and treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'External beam planning module of Eclipse for external beam radiation therapy.', 'Measuring out-of-field dose to the hippocampus in common radiotherapy indications.', 'Secondary malignancy risk for patients with localized prostate cancer after intensity-modulated radiotherapy with and without flattening filter.', 'The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma.', 'mARC preoperative rectal cancer treatments vs. 3D conformal radiotherapy.

Bladder contours were delineated on co-registered daily Megavoltage CT (MVCT) by a single observer and copied on the planning CT to generate dose-volume/surface histograms (DVH/DSH) and bladder DSMs. Discrepancies between planned and daily absorbed doses were analyzed through the average of individual systematic errors, the population systematic errors and the population random errors for the DVH/DSHs and DSMs. In total, 477 DVH/DSH and 472 DSM were available. DSH and DVH showed small population systematic errors of absolute surfaces (<3.4cm(2)) and volumes (<8.4cm(3)) at the highest doses. The dose to the posterior bladder base assessed on DSMs showed a mean systematic error below 1Gy, with population systematic and random errors within 4 and 3Gy, respectively. The region surrounding this area shows higher mean systematic errors (1-3Gy), population systematic (8-11Gy) and random (5-7Gy) errors. In conclusion, DVH/DSH and DSMs are quite stable with respect to inter-fraction variations in the high-dose region, within about 2cm from bladder base.

Bony metastases most often arise from breast, prostate and kidney cancer as well as myeloma, in which patient survival is relatively long. Large lytic defects within the pelvis, and especially the acetabular area, necessitate surgical treatment with specially designed prostheses, which significantly improves the patients' quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the indications and early outcomes and describe the surgical technique of implantation of the Lumic prosthesis.  Material and methods:   Over the period 2011-2015, six patients underwent resection of periacetabular area metastases followed by implantation of a Lumic prosthesis in the Orthopedic Department in Brzozów. The surgical procedures and their outcomes were assessed with special regard to pain intensity, physical functioning and mobility of patients. The surgeries were performed from an inverted 'S'-shaped approach with a margin of healthy tissue and acetabula were implanted without cement (in 2 patients) and using bone cement (in 4 patients).  Results:   Post-operative pain intensity was significantly lower (3.4 in a VAS scale) and the patients' physical function improved (65 in Karnofsky scale). There were no intra- or post-operative complications. Deterioration in muscular function associated with the surgical technique was acceptable as the surgery enabled the patients to walk.  Conclusions:   1. Surgical intervention in patients with periacetabular metastases often requires the use of modular or custom-made implants. 2. Radiotherapy is a complementary treatment or is reserved for use in patients in poor general health. 3.

Here, we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate how three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the context of copy-number variation, long-range epigenetic remodeling, and atypical gene expression programs in prostate cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the ability to segment their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs); however, these domains are generally smaller due to establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly, a large proportion of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries occur at regions that display copy-number variation. Notably, a common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer spanning the TP53 tumor suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is also accompanied by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions within the TADs that are enriched at regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators, and associated with alterations in gene expression.

Large-scale explorative genomic projects have identified several genes as potential targets for therapy, including fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).  Aims:   The aim of this study was to investigate the biological significance of wild-type and mutated FGFR3 to evaluate its potential as a novel therapeutic target in HNSCC.  Methods:   FGFR3 protein expression was analysed in a large HNSCC tissue cohort (n = 536) and FGFR3 mRNA expression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 520). Moreover, FGFR3 wild-type and mutant versions were overexpressed in vitro, and both proliferation and migration was assessed with and without BGJ398 (a specific FGFR1-3 inhibitor) treatment.  Results:   Although FGFR3 expression for both cohorts decreased during tumour progression, high FGFR3 expression levels were observed in a small subset of patients. In vitro, FGFR3 overexpression led to increased proliferation, whereas migration was not altered. Moreover, FGFR3-overexpressing cells were more sensitive to BGJ398. Cells overexpressing FGFR3 mutant versions showed increased proliferation compared to wild-type FGFR3 under serum-reduced conditions and were largely as sensitive as the wild-type protein to BGJ398.  Conclusions:   Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that although FGFR3 expression decreases during HNSSC progression, it plays an important role in tumour cell proliferation and thus may be a potential target for therapy in selected patients suffering from this dismal tumour entity.""","""['Anne von Mässenhausen', 'Mario Deng', 'Hannah Billig', 'Angela Queisser', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Andreas Schröck', 'Friedrich Bootz', 'Friederike Göke', 'Alina Franzen', 'Lynn Heasley', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Johannes Brägelmann', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Target Oncol""","""['Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein is overexpressed in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins act as naturally occurring drivers of tumor resistance by functionally substituting for EGFR/ERK signaling.', 'FGFR1 Expression Levels Predict BGJ398 Sensitivity of FGFR1-Dependent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancers.', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family Members as Prognostic Biomarkers in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'FGFR3 overexpression is a\xa0relevant alteration in colorectal cancer.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of FGFR Signaling in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Co-expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 with mutant p53, and its association with worse outcome in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Association Between Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 Gene Amplification and Human Papillomavirus Prevalence in Tonsillar Squamous Cell Carcinoma With Clinicopathologic Analysis.', 'Inhibition of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway: the current landscape and barriers to clinical application.']"""

The goal of the present pre-clinical study was to explore the immunogenic properties and protective efficacy of a novel prostate cancer immunotherapy based on the heterologous prime-boost viral-vectored vaccination platform. The simian adenovirus, ChAdOx1, and modified vaccinia Ankara virus, MVA, encoding a prostate cancer-associated antigen, the six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1), induced strong sustained antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c male mice.

A combination of the vaccine with PD-1 blocking antibody significantly improved survival of the animals, with 80 % of mice remaining tumour-free.

Methods:   The study included 1560 prostate cancer patients from four radiotherapy cohorts: RAPPER (n=533), RADIOGEN (n=597), GenePARE (n=290) and CCI (n=150). Data from genome-wide association studies were imputed with the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Individuals were genetically similar with a European ancestry based on principal component analysis. Genetic risks were quantified using polygenic risk scores. Regression models tested associations between risk scores and 2-year toxicity (overall, urinary frequency, decreased stream, rectal bleeding). Results were combined across studies using standard inverse-variance fixed effects meta-analysis methods.  Results:   A total of 75 variants were genotyped/imputed successfully.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all patients age 18 and over with a diagnosis of colorectal (275 985 patients), breast (359 771), prostate (286 426) and lung cancer (283 940) in England between 2001 and 2010. Incidence costs, prevalence costs, and phase of care costs were estimated separately for patients age 18-64 and ⩾65. Costs of care were compared by patients staging, before and after diagnosis, and with a comparison population without cancer.  Results:   Incidence costs in the first year of diagnosis are noticeably higher in patients age 18-64 than age ⩾65 across all examined cancers. A lower stage diagnosis is associated with larger cost savings for colorectal and breast cancer in both age groups. The additional costs of care because of the main four cancers amounts to £1.5 billion in 2010, namely 3.0% of the total cost of hospital care.

Pharmacological and siRNA-based HDAC inhibition both revealed the involvement of HDAC2 and HDAC3 in KC a3.1 transcription through the same mechanism.

Patients and methods:   Complication rates were prospectively assessed in a series of 1,000 consecutive patients who underwent RALP (group I, cases 1-200; IIa, 201-400; IIb, 401-600; IIIa, 601-800; and IIIb, 801-1000). Preoperative evaluation focused on patients' history of gout, use of drugs that can influence clotting time, and cardiopulmonary problems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was routinely performed. Operative difficulty was assessed based on the following variables: neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT), obesity [body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m(2)], prostate volume >70 g, presence of a large median lobe with intravesical protrusion >1 cm, previous transurethral resection of the prostate, previous pelvic surgery, previous extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND), and salvage robotic radical prostatectomy (SRP).  Results:   Operative difficulty tended to increase significantly with greater age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists' anesthetic/surgical risk class scores, increased BMI, and more advanced clinical stage. The number of cases with NHT, obesity, previous pelvic surgery, EPLND, and SRP significantly increased from early to later groups of patients. Conversely, significantly less blood loss occurred in later groups of patients (group I, 179 ml to 97 ml in group IIIb; p<0.001). The need for blood transfusions gradually reduced from 3.5% to 0.5% in groups I and IIIb, respectively (p=0.022). The total complication rate was 6.4% (64/1,000; surgical/medical=5%/1.4%). Complication rates decreased significantly: 12%, 6%, 6%, 4%, and 4% in groups I, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb, respectively (p=0.003). The most common complications were blood transfusion and bowel problems (11/1,000=1.1%).  Conclusion:   Assessed in terms of groups of 200 cases, the surgeon's learning curve for RALP showed significantly fewer complications even as the operative difficulty of cases increased. The keys to preventing complications were meticulous preoperative evaluation of patients, MRI planning, and a dedicated robotic team for performing RALP. Early diagnosis and management of complications are paramount in patients who present any deviation from the normal postoperative course and clinical care pathway.""","""['Yen-Chuan Ou', 'Chun-Kuang Yang', 'Kuangh-Si Chang', 'John Wang', 'Siu-Wan Hung', 'Min-Che Tung', 'Ashutosh K Tewari', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['The learning curve for reducing complications of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon.', 'Radical prostatectomy after previous transurethral resection of the prostate: robot-assisted laparoscopic versus open radical prostatectomy in a matched-pair analysis.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open: comparison of the learning curve of a single surgeon.', 'Downsides of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: limitations and complications.', 'Current role of salvage robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Incorporating VR-RENDER Fusion Software in Robot-Assisted Partial Prostatectomy: The First Case Report.', 'Examination of Necessity for Pelvic Drain Placement After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Robotic Incisional Hernia Repair After Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP): A 3-port Approach.', 'Neuropathic painful complications due to endopelvic nerve lesions after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: Three case reports.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy may induce inguinal hernia within the first 2 years: An 11-year single-surgeon experience of >400 cases.']"""

Derivatives of 17β-estradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, as well as selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as fulvestrant, are novel potentially active anticancer agents. In particular, 2-methoxyestradiol is effective in treatment of numerous malignancies, including breast and prostate cancer, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Herein, we treated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with physiologically and pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 2-methoxyestradiol. We used flow cytometry in order to determine cell viability, cell death, level of nitric oxide and mitochondrial membrane potential. We demonstrated that at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, 2-methoxyestradiol results in induction of apoptosis of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via nitric oxide generation and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. Based on the obtained data, we propose that 2-methoxyestradiol may be a natural modulator of cancer cell death and survival through nitro-oxidative stress-dependent mechanisms.

We aimed to determine whether receipt of any ADT or longer duration of ADT for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with an increased risk of depression.  Methods:   We identified 78,552 men older than age 65 years with stage I to III PCa using the SEER-Medicare-linked database from 1992 to 2006, excluding patients with psychiatric diagnoses within the prior year. Our primary analysis was the association between pharmacologic ADT and the diagnosis of depression or receipt of inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment using Cox proportional hazards regression. Drug data for treatment of depression were not available. Our secondary analysis investigated the association between duration of ADT and each end point.  Results:   Overall, 43% of patients (n = 33,882) who received ADT, compared with patients who did not receive ADT, had higher 3-year cumulative incidences of depression (7.1% v 5.2%, respectively), inpatient psychiatric treatment (2.8% v 1.9%, respectively), and outpatient psychiatric treatment (3.4% v 2.5%, respectively; all P < .001). Adjusted Cox analyses demonstrated that patients with ADT had a 23% increased risk of depression (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.31), 29% increased risk of inpatient psychiatric treatment (AHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.41), and a nonsignificant 7% increased risk of outpatient psychiatric treatment (AHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.17) compared with patients without ADT. The risk of depression increased with duration of ADT, from 12% with ≤ 6 months of treatment, 26% with 7 to 11 months of treatment, to 37% with ≥ 12 months of treatment (P trend < .001). A similar duration effect was seen for inpatient (P trend < .001) and outpatient psychiatric treatment (P trend < .001).

Patients and methods:   Tracker-based MR-TRUS fusion was applied using local reference augmentation. In contrast to conventional whole gland fusion, local reference augmentation focuses the highest registration accuracy to the region surrounding the lesion to be biopsied. Pre-acquired multi-parametric MR images (mpMRI) were evaluated using PIRADS classification. T2-weighted MR images were imported on an ultrasound machine to allow for MR-TRUS fusion. Biopsies were targeted to the most suspicious lesion area identified on mpMRI. Each target was biopsied 1-5 times. For each biopsied lesion the diameter, PIRADS and Gleason scores, visibility during fusion, and representativeness were recorded.  Results:   Included were 23 consecutive patients with 25 MR suspicious lesions, of which 11 patients had a previous negative TRUS-guided biopsy and 12 were biopsy naïve. The cancer detection rate was 64 % (Gleason score ≥6). Biopsy was negative (i.e., no Gleason score) in seven patients confirmed by follow-up in all of them (up to 18 months). After MR-TRUS fusion, 88 % of the lesions could be visualized on TRUS. The cancer detection rate increases with increasing lesion size, being 73 % for lesions larger than 10 mm.

Activation of TRPM2 channels, however, caused intracellular release of not only Ca(2+) but also of Zn(2+) Intriguingly, elevation of intracellular Zn(2+) faithfully reproduced all of the effects of H2O2, whereas Ca(2+) showed opposite effects. Interestingly, H2O2 caused increased trafficking of Zn(2+)-enriched lysosomes to the leading edge of migrating cells, presumably to impart polarisation of Zn(2+) location. Thus, our results indicate that a reciprocal interplay between Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) regulates actin remodelling and cell migration; they call for a revision of the current notion that implicates an exclusive role for Ca(2+) in cell migration.""","""['Fangfang Li', 'Nada Abuarab', 'Asipu Sivaprasadarao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Signalling mechanisms mediating Zn2+-induced TRPM2 channel activation and cell death in microglial cells.', 'A critical role of the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 channel in a positive feedback mechanism for reactive oxygen species-induced delayed cell death.', 'Facilitation of H2O2-induced A172 human glioblastoma cell death by insertion of oxidative stress-sensitive TRPM2 channels.', 'Roles of NAD+ and Its Metabolites Regulated Calcium Channels in Cancer.', 'TRPM2: a calcium influx pathway regulated by oxidative stress and the novel second messenger ADP-ribose.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Silencing TRPM2 enhanced erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells through destabilizing HIF-1α and Nrf2 proteins.', 'The interplay between physical cues and mechanosensitive ion channels in cancer metastasis.', 'Protein interactions with metallothionein-3 promote vectorial active transport in human proximal tubular cells.', 'The Pan-Cancer Landscape of Crosstalk Between TRP Family and Tumour Microenvironment Relevant to Prognosis and Immunotherapy Response.']"""

Prostatic stromal tumors of unknown malignant potential (STUMP) and SFT have overlapping features. NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions that were recently identified in various SFTs lead to nuclear translocalization of STAT6. Nuclear STAT6 immunostaining is now considered an adjunct for SFT diagnosis. We evaluated STAT6 and an emerging stemness marker, ALDH1, in the differential diagnosis of SFT versus prostatic stromal lesions. Sixteen STUMPs, 12 SFTs, and 4 prostatic stromal sarcomas (12 needle biopsies, 13 radical prostatectomies, 7 transurethral resections) were retrieved (1995-2015). Sections were stained with polyclonal STAT6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; S20, 1:100) and monoclonal ALDH1 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; clone 44, 1:250). In STAT6 cases, only unequivocal nuclear staining (with/without cytoplasmic staining) was considered positive. Cytoplasmic ALDH1 staining was counted positive. Ten of 11 evaluable SFTs demonstrated strong and diffuse nuclear STAT6 positivity; 4 of 16 STUMPs had nuclear staining that was weak (1/4) or focal (1/4). ALDH1 positivity was seen in 10 of 12 evaluable SFTs and 3 of 15 STUMPs. Prostatic stromal sarcomas were STAT6 negative (4/4); 2 of 4 were ALDH1 positive. The sensitivity and specificity for STAT6 for the diagnosis of SFT were 91% and 75%, respectively. Coexpression of STAT6 and ALDH1 yielded the same sensitivity but improved the specificity (100%) for the diagnosis of SFT. STAT6 is a useful marker in the differential diagnosis of SFT versus STUMP. Using STAT6 and ALDH1 together increases specificity. STUMPs can show STAT6 positivity, and when they do, it is likely to be weak or focal.""","""['Gunes Guner', 'Justin A Bishop', 'Stephania M Bezerra', 'Diana Taheri', 'David J Zahavi', 'Maria Angelica Mendoza Rodriguez', 'Rajni Sharma', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'George J Netto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['The many faces of solitary fibrous tumor; diversity of histological features, differential diagnosis and role of molecular studies and surrogate markers in avoiding misdiagnosis and predicting the behavior.', 'Differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumors: A study of 454 soft tissue tumors indicating the diagnostic value of nuclear STAT6 relocation and ALDH1 expression combined with in situ proximity ligation assay.', 'Differential Diagnosis of Meningeal SFT-HPC and Meningioma: Which Immunohistochemical Markers Should Be Used?', 'Immunohistochemical evaluation of stem cell markers and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in solitary fibrous tumors.', 'Primary solitary fibrous tumour of the prostate: A case report and literature review.', 'Malignant Solitary Fibrous Tumours of the Pleura Are Not All the Same: Analysis of Long-Term Outcomes and Evaluation of Risk Stratification Models in a Large Single-Centre Series.', 'Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the Prostate: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Characteristics of Solitary Fibrous Tumor and Its Mimics: A Single-Center Experience.', 'Re-evaluating tumors of purported specialized prostatic stromal origin reveals molecular heterogeneity, including non-recurring gene fusions characteristic of uterine and soft tissue sarcoma subtypes.', 'The many faces of solitary fibrous tumor; diversity of histological features, differential diagnosis and role of molecular studies and surrogate markers in avoiding misdiagnosis and predicting the behavior.']"""

Misspecification of this association can lead to reduced power, and potentially incorrect conclusions regarding treatment efficacy.  Methods:   We compared several methods of adjustment to determine which is best when the association between covariate and outcome is unknown. We assessed (a) dichotomisation or categorisation; (b) assuming a linear association with outcome; (c) using fractional polynomials with one (FP1) or two (FP2) polynomial terms; and (d) using restricted cubic splines with 3 or 5 knots. We evaluated each method using simulation and through a re-analysis of trial datasets.  Results:   Methods which kept covariates as continuous typically had higher power than methods which used categorisation.

Multivariable models compared RP pathology, use of salvage radiotherapy and prostate cancer mortality based on timing of RP (< 1, 1-2 or >2 years after diagnosis). Median follow-up was 8.1 years.  Results:   Men undergoing RP more than 2 years after diagnosis had a higher risk of Gleason upgrading [odds ratio 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.34-3.68] and an increased risk of salvage radiotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 1.90, 95% CI 1.41-2.55], but no significant increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.85, 95% CI 0.57-5.99). In competing risk analysis, 7 year prostate cancer-specific cumulative mortality was similar, at less than 1%, for immediate RP and active surveillance regardless of later intervention. Limitations of this study include the lack of data on follow-up biopsies and the limited follow-up time.  Conclusion:   Men undergoing RP more than 2 years after diagnosis had more adverse pathological features and second line therapy, highlighting the trade-off in deferring immediate curative therapy.

Stromal nuclear β-catenin abundance was greater in HGPIN and PCa compared with BPT (P < .05 for both), and epithelial nuclear β-catenin abundance was lower in metastatic PCa than in BPT (P < .05 for both). Epithelial and stromal nuclear LEF1 abundance was greater in HGPIN compared with BPT, whereas epithelial nuclear LEF1 was also greater in metastases. The proportion of epithelial and stromal nuclear double-positive β-catenin(+)/LEF1(+) cells was greater in HGPIN compared with BPT.

A significant amount of stromal cells were positive for LEF1 but not β-catenin. β-Catenin and LEF1 abundance were negatively correlated in the epithelium (P < .0001) but not the stroma (P > .05). We conclude that β-catenin and LEF1 colocalization is increased in HGPIN and metastasis relative to BPT, suggesting a role for β-catenin/LEF1-mediated transcription in both malignant transformation and metastasis of PCa.

Using a planning approach typical for these treatments, a linear-quadratic-based model for TCP was used to compare mean TCP values for a population of patients who experiences a geometric miss (i.e., systematic and random shifts of the clinical target volume within the planning target dose distribution). A Monte Carlo approach was used to account for the different biological sensitivities of a population of patients. Interestingly, for errors consisting of coplanar systematic target volume offsets and three-dimensional random offsets, static gantry IMRT appears to offer an advantage over VMAT in that larger shift errors are tolerated for the same mean TCP. For example, under the conditions simulated, erroneous systematic shifts of 15mm directly between or directly into static gantry IMRT fields result in mean TCP values between 96% and 98%, whereas the same errors on VMAT plans result in mean TCP values between 45% and 74%. Random geometric shifts of the target volume were characterized using normal distributions in each Cartesian dimension. When the standard deviations were doubled from those values assumed in the derivation of the treatment margins, our model showed a 7% drop in mean TCP for the static gantry IMRT plans but a 20% drop in TCP for the VMAT plans. Although adding a margin for error to a clinical target volume is perhaps the best approach to account for expected geometric misses, this work suggests that static gantry IMRT may offer a treatment that is more tolerant to geometric miss errors than VMAT.""","""['Michael Balderson', 'Derek Brown', 'Patricia Johnson', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Feasibility of a unified approach to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volume-modulated arc therapy optimization and delivery.', 'Dose comparisons for conformal, IMRT and VMAT prostate plans.', 'Volumetric modulated Arc therapy and conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy for simultaneous maximal intraprostatic boost: a planning comparison study.', 'Online adaptation and verification of VMAT.', 'Dosimetric effect of body contour changes for prostate and head and neck volumetric modulated arc therapy plans.']"""

Methylation of MEKK2 by SMYD3 is important for regulation of the MEK/ERK pathway, suggesting the possibility of selectively targeting SMYD3 in RAS-driven cancers. Structural and kinetic characterization of SMYD3 was undertaken leading to a co-crystal structure of SMYD3 with a MEKK2-peptide substrate bound, and the observation that SMYD3 follows a partially processive mechanism. These insights allowed for the design of GSK2807, a potent and selective, SAM-competitive inhibitor of SMYD3 (Ki = 14 nM). A high-resolution crystal structure reveals that GSK2807 bridges the gap between the SAM-binding pocket and the substrate lysine tunnel of SMYD3.

A midpoint dose was employed as a patient dose index. First, a reference dose (RD) and low-dose (LD)-CBCT images were acquired with a reference dose and various low doses. Second, an automated rigid registration was performed for three axis translations to estimate patient setup errors between a planning CT image and the LD-CBCT images processed by six noise suppression filters (averaging filter, median filter, Gaussian filter, edge-preserving smoothing filter, bilateral filter, and adaptive partial median filter (AMF)). Third, residual errors representing the patient positioning accuracy were calculated as Euclidean distances between the setup error vectors estimated using the LD-CBCT and RD-CBCT images. Finally, the residual errors as a function of the patient dose index were estimated for LD-CBCT images processed by six noise suppression filters, and then the patient dose indices for the filtered LD-CBCT images were obtained at the same residual error as the RD-CBCT image. This approach was applied to an anthropomorphic phantom and four cancer patients. The patient dose for the LD-CBCT images was reduced to 19% of that for the RD-CBCT image for the phantom by using AMF, while keeping a same residual error of 0.47 mm as the RD-CBCT image by applying the noise suppression filters to the LD-CBCT images. The average patient dose was reduced to 31.1% for prostate cancer patients, and it was reduced to 82.5% for a lung cancer patient by applying the AMF.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the involvement of lncRNA HOTTIP in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and further investigate the role of HOXA13 in this process. Here, we showed that HOTTIP silencing inhibited cell survival pathway in vitro and in vivo by reducing the protein expression of Bcl-2 and enhancing Bax. We further demonstrated that knockdown of HOTTIP inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein Cyclin D1 and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Additionally, depletion of HOXA13 by RNA interference (si-HOXA13) revealed that HOTTIP silencing suppressed cell growth at least partly through regulating HOXA13.

In the present study the cytotoxic effects of Urtica dioica extract were assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan blue viability dye. Then, DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were exploited to measure cell death and apoptosis stage. The expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 9 and Bcl-2 genes were quantified by Real-Time PCR. Finally, Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. MTT assay showed that dichloromethanolic extract of Urtica dioica significantly inhibited the cell growth. According to the DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assay results, the herbal extract was able to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Our findings also demonstrated that the plant extract substantially increases the caspase 3 and 9 mRNA expression, while decreases Bcl-2. Cell cycle arrest was occurred in G2 stage, due to the results of flow cytometry.

Materials and methods:   One hundred fifty-eight consecutive subjects underwent 3-T multiparametric MRI with endorectal coil before RP between November 2010 and November 2013. Data were randomly split 60% and 40% into derivation (n = 95) and validation (n = 62) datasets. Multiparametric MRI was used to assess the radiologic stage, and logistic regression models were created using the derivation dataset and were fit on the independent validation dataset using multiparametric MRI staging alone and with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level as the covariate. The probability of each patient to harbor OC disease was calculated using an updated version of Partin tables, using either clinical staging from digital rectal examination (DRE) or radiologic staging (multiparametric MRI). The AUC was calculated to evaluate accuracy of these predictive methods.  Results:   The accuracy of multiparametric MRI to predict OC disease on pathologic analysis was greater (AUC, 0.88) than that of Partin tables (AUC, 0.70) and improved when multiparametric MRI was combined with PSA level (AUC, 0.91). The accuracy of Partin nomograms to predict OC disease decreased (AUC, 0.63) when staging was based on multiparametric MRI versus DRE.  Conclusion:   The superior predictive accuracy of multiparametric MRI compared with Partin tables to predict OC disease validates the results of smaller previously published studies. Although there is no added benefit of substituting multiparametric MRI stage for clinical stage when using Partin tables, multiparametric MRI staging information is valuable as a stand-alone test.""","""['Rajan T Gupta', 'Alison Flanagan Brown', 'Rachel Kloss Silverman', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'John F Madden', 'Daniel J George', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Re: Can Radiologic Staging with Multiparametric MRI Enhance the Accuracy of the Partin Tables in Predicting Organ-Confined Prostate Cancer?', 'Comparing 3-T multiparametric MRI and the Partin tables to predict organ-confined prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adding multiparametric MRI to the MSKCC and Partin nomograms for primary prostate cancer: Improving local tumor staging?', 'Are Partin tables suitable for Chinese patients with prostate cancer?', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison between Briganti, Partin and MSKCC tools in predicting positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prediction of Pathologic Findings with MRI-Based Clinical Staging Using the Bayesian Network Modeling in Prostate Cancer: A Radiation Oncologist Perspective.', 'Development of an Indian nomogram for predicting extracapsular extension in prostate cancer.', 'Biparametric MRI prior to Radical Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in a Caribbean Population: Implications for Risk Group Stratification and Treatment.', 'Defining prostate cancer size and treatment margin for focal therapy: does intralesional heterogeneity impact the performance of multiparametric MRI?', 'Prostate MRI added to CAPRA, MSKCC and Partin cancer nomograms significantly enhances the prediction of adverse findings and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Androgen receptor reactivation during the androgen-independent stage of prostate cancer is mediated by numerous mechanisms including expression of AR mutants and splice variants that become non-responsive to conventional anti-androgenic agents. Resveratrol and its natural analogs exhibit varying degrees of anti-androgenic effects on tumor growth suppression in prostate cancer. However, the structural basis for the observed differential activity remains unknown. Here, anti-androgenic activities of resveratrol and its natural analogs, namely, pterostilbene, piceatannol and trimethoxy-resveratrol were studied in LNCaP cells expressing T877A mutant AR and atomistic simulations were employed to establish the structure activity relationship. Interestingly, essential hydrogen bonding contacts and the binding energies of resveratrol analogs with AR ligand binding domain (LBD), emerge as key differentiating factors for varying anti-androgenic action. Among all the analogs, pterostilbene exhibited strongest anti-androgenic activity and its binding energy and hydrogen bonding interactions pattern closely resembled pure anti-androgen, flutamide. Principal component analysis of our simulation studies revealed that androgenic compounds bind more strongly to AR LBD compared to anti-androgenic compounds and provide conformational stabilization of the receptor in essential subspace.

Therefore, pre-operatively available prognostic biomarkers are needed to help therapy decisions. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is a promising prognostic tissue marker in several cancers including PC but serum levels of shedded SDC1-ectodomain (sSDC1) have not been assessed in PC.  Methods:   A total of 150 patients with PC were included in this study (n = 99 serum samples, n = 103 paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE), n = 52 overlap). SDC1 protein expression and cellular localization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while sSDC1 serum concentrations were measured by ELISA. Serum sSDC1 levels were compared to those of MMP7, which is known to be a protease involved in SDC1 ectodomain-shedding. Clinico-pathological and follow-up data were collected and correlated with SDC1 tissue and serum levels. Disease (PC)-specific (DSS) and overall-survival (OS) were primary endpoints.  Results:   Median follow-up was 167 months in the serum- and 146 months in the FFPE-group. SDC1-reactivity was higher in non-neoplastic prostate glands compared to PC. In addition, cytoplasmatic, but not membranous SDC1 expression was enhanced in PC patients with higher Gleason-score >6 PC (P = 0.016). Soluble SDC1-levels were higher in patients with Gleason-score >6 (P = 0.043) and metastatic disease (P = 0.022) as well as in patients with progressed disease treated with palliative transurethral resection (P = 0.002). In addition, sSDC1 levels were associated with higher MMP7 serum concentration (P = 0.005). In univariable analyses, only sSDC1-levels exhibited a trend to unfavorable DSS (P = 0.077). In a multivariable pre-operative model, high pre-operative sSDC1-level (>123 ng/ml) proved to be an independent marker of adverse OS (P = 0.048) and DSS (P = 0.020).  Conclusions:   The present study does not confirm the prognostic relevance of SDC1-IHC. The significant higher sSDC1 serum levels in advanced cases of PC, suggest that SDC1 shedding might be involved in PC progression. Additionally, high sSDC1-level proved to be an independent factor of adverse OS and DSS in a multivariable pre-operative model, making evaluation of sSDC1-levels a promising tool for pre-operative risk-stratification and/or therapy monitoring.

Elevated CENP-A expression has been associated with cancer development. This study aimed to establish whether elevated CENP-A expression can be used as a prognostic and predictive cancer biomarker. Molecular profiling of CENP-A in human cancers was investigated using genomic, transcriptomic and patient information from databases, including COSMIC, Oncomine, Kaplan-Meier plotter and cBioPortal. A network of CENP-A co-expressed genes was derived from cBioPortal and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Oncomine protocols to explore the function of CENP-A and its predictive potential. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CENP-A expression was analyzed in silico. It was found that CENP-A expression was elevated in 20 types of solid cancer compared with normal counterparts. Elevated CENP-A expression highly correlated with cancer progression and poor patient outcome. Genomic analysis indicated that the elevated CENP-A expression was not due to alterations in the sequence or copy number of the CENP-A gene. Furthermore, CENP-A can be regulated by key oncogenic proteins and tumor-suppressive microRNAs. CENP-A co-expression network analysis indicated that CENP-A function is associated with cell cycle progression. Oncomine analysis showed a strong correlation between elevated CENP-A expression and oncolytic response of breast cancer patients to taxane-based chemotherapy.

Objective:   To investigate the associations between circulating folate and vitamin B12 concentrations and risk of PCa overall and by disease stage and grade.  Design, setting, and participants:   A study was performed with a nested case-control design based on individual participant data from six cohort studies including 6875 cases and 8104 controls; blood collection from 1981 to 2008, and an average follow-up of 8.9 yr (standard deviation 7.3). Odds ratios (ORs) of incident PCa by study-specific fifths of circulating folate and vitamin B12 were calculated using multivariable adjusted conditional logistic regression.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incident PCa and subtype by stage and grade.  Results and limitations:   Higher folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were associated with a small increase in risk of PCa (ORs for the top vs bottom fifths were 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.26], ptrend=0.018, for folate and 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01-1.25], ptrend=0.017, for vitamin B12), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies. The association with folate varied by tumour grade (pheterogeneity<0.001); higher folate concentration was associated with an elevated risk of high-grade disease (OR for the top vs bottom fifth: 2.30 [95% CI, 1.28-4.12]; ptrend=0.001), with no association for low-grade disease. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the association of folate with risk by stage or of vitamin B12 with risk by stage or grade of disease (pheterogeneity>0.05). Use of single blood-sample measurements of folate and B12 concentrations is a limitation.  Conclusions:   The association between higher folate concentration and risk of high-grade disease, not evident for low-grade disease, suggests a possible role for folate in the progression of clinically relevant PCa and warrants further investigation.  Patient summary:   Folate, a vitamin obtained from foods and supplements, is important for maintaining cell health. In this study, however, men with higher blood folate levels were at greater risk of high-grade (more aggressive) prostate cancer compared with men with lower folate levels. Further research is needed to investigate the possible role of folate in the progression of this disease.""","""['Alison J Price', 'Ruth C Travis', 'Paul N Appleby', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Aurelio Barricarte Gurrea', 'Tone Bjørge', 'H Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Chu Chen', 'Jenny Donovan', 'Randi Gislefoss', 'Gary Goodman', 'Marc Gunter', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Mattias Johansson', 'Irena B King', 'Tilman Kühn', 'Satu Männistö', 'Richard M Martin', 'Klaus Meyer', 'David E Neal', 'Marian L Neuhouser', 'Ottar Nygård', 'Par Stattin', 'Grethe S Tell', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Rosario Tumino', 'Per Magne Ueland', 'Arve Ulvik', 'Stefan de Vogel', 'Stein Emil Vollset', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Timothy J Key', 'Naomi E Allen;Endogenous Hormones', ' Nutritional Biomarkers', ' and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Alison J.

The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is the main cause of local and distant tumour recurrence and is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that prostate tumour overexpressed-1 (PTOV1) enhances the CSC population and augments the tumourigenicity of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PTOV1 suppresses transcription of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) by recruiting histone deacetylases and subsequently reducing DKK1 promoter histone acetylation, followed by activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Restoration of DKK1 expression in PTOV1-overexpressing cells counteracts the effects of PTOV1 on Wnt/β-catenin activation and the CSC population. Collectively, these results suggest that PTOV1 positively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and enhances tumourigenicity in breast cancer; this novel mechanism may represent a therapeutic target for breast cancer.

Abnormal expression of Bcl-2 is commonly found in cancer cells, which increases their anti-apoptotic potency and chemoresistance. We investigated the effects of Bcl-2 expression status on the susceptibility of DU145 cells, an androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line, to docetaxel and other anticancer agents. A panel of Bcl-2-expressing DU145 cell lines was established. Bcl-2 expression levels were unrelated to the susceptibility of DU145 cells to docetaxel. The sensitivity of DU145 cells to cisplatin fluctuated, and the sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was decreased by Bcl-2 overexpression. In a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of Bcl-2 drastically decreased the sensitivity of DU145 cells to cisplatin and TNF-α; however, there was no change in the response to docetaxel. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that Bcl-2-overexpression had no effect on the docetaxel-induced death of DU145 cells, but significantly decreased DU145 cell death induced by cisplatin or TNF-α. Interestingly, docetaxel hardly induced caspase-3/7 activation in control or Bcl-2-overexpressing DU145 cells, but did at a low level in LNCaP cells, another prostate cancer cell line. Moreover, in contrast to LNCaP cells, the reduced viabilities of docetaxel-treated control and Bcl-2-overexpressing DU145 cells were not restored by the addition of either a Bid inhibitor or a panel of pro-apoptotic caspase inhibitors.

RSK2 was found to be essential for osteosarcoma formation. To investigate whether RSK2 is expressed at high levels in human osteosarcome tissues and whether its expression is correlated with the aggressive biological behavior of osteosarcoma cell line (OCLs), we assessed the association between RSK2 expression and OS cell progression, as well as the effects of RSK2 inhibition on the biological activities of osteosarcoma cells. We performed immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of RSK2 in specimens from 30 humans with osteosarcoma, and 15 normal tissues. RSK2 gene expression levels in 30 specimens with osteosarcoma were significantly higher than those of normal tissues. We performed RNA interference on three OCLs to evaluate cell apoptosis, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, chemosensitivity and oncogenicity. After transfection with RSK2 shRNA, increased cell apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, cell cycle progression, weaker cell proliferation, cell migration and weaker tumor formation were observed in all OCLs. These results suggested that RSK2 expression may mediate the biological activities of OS cells and RSK2 may be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of osteosarcomas.

Certain microRNAs (miRs) have been proven to be useful biomarkers, several of which are detectable in bodily fluids. The present study identified and validated a urinary miR‑based signature to enhance the specificity of PCa diagnosis and to reduce the number of patients with benign conditions undergoing biopsy. Seventy‑three urine samples from Mexican patients with diagnosis of PCa with a Gleason score ≥7 and 70 patients diagnosed with BPH were collected after digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate. miR expression profiles were determined using TaqMan Low Density Array experiments, and normalized Ct values for the miRs were compared between PCa and BPH groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether miR detection in urine is suitable for distinguishing patients with PCa from those with BPH. The identified miR‑100/200b signature was significantly correlated with PCa. Using a multivariable logistic regression approach, a base model including the clinical variables age, prostate‑specific antigen (PSA), the percentage of free PSA and DRE was generated, and a second base model additionally contained the miR‑100/200b signature. ROC analysis demonstrated that the combined model significantly outperformed the capacity of PSA (P<0.001) and the base model (P=0.01) to discriminate between PCa and BPH patients. In terms of evaluation of the sub‑group of patients in the gray zone of PSA levels, the performance of the combined model for predicting PCa cases was significantly superior to PSA level determination (P<0.001) and the base model (P=0.009). In addition, decision curve analysis demonstrated that the use of the combined model increased the clinical benefit for patients and produced a substantial reduction in unnecessary biopsies across a range of reasonable threshold probabilities (10‑50%). Detection of the urinary miR signature identified in the present study as part of clinical diagnostic procedures will enhance the accuracy of PCa diagnosis and provide a clinical benefit for patients with BPH by sparing them from undergoing invasive biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to describe the profiling of urinary miR100 and miR-200b levels for the clinical diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Alberto Ivan Salido-Guadarrama', 'Jorge Gustavo Morales-Montor', 'Claudia Rangel-Escareño', 'Elizabeth Langley', 'Oscar Peralta-Zaragoza', 'Jose Luis Cruz Colin', 'Mauricio Rodriguez-Dorantes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['A novel urinary long non-coding RNA transcript improves diagnostic accuracy in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'MiR-145 detection in urinary extracellular vesicles increase diagnostic efficiency of prostate cancer based on hydrostatic filtration dialysis method.', 'MicroRNA-21 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a novel biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.', 'Novel Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Urine Cell-Free MicroRNAs in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Urinary hsv2-miR-H9 to hsa-miR-3659 ratio is an effective marker for discriminating prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia in patients within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

The transcription factor ΔNp63α promotes basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) migration by inducing the expression of the mesenchymal genes Slug and Axl, which confers cells with a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state. However, the extent of the ΔNp63α regulated genes that support invasive behavior is not known. Here, using gene expression analysis, ChIP-seq, and functional testing, we find that ΔNp63α promotes BLBC motility by inducing the expression of the atypical cadherin FAT2, the vesicular binding protein SNCA, the carbonic anhydrase CA12, the lipid binding protein CPNE8 and the kinase NEK1, along with Slug and Axl. Notably, lung squamous cell carcinoma migration also required ΔNp63α dependent FAT2 and Slug expression, demonstrating that ΔNp63α promotes migration in multiple tumor types by inducing mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal genes. ΔNp63α activation of FAT2 and Slug influenced E-cadherin localization to cell-cell contacts, which can restrict spontaneous cell movement. Moreover, live-imaging of spheroids in organotypic culture demonstrated that ΔNp63α, FAT2 and Slug were essential for the extension of cellular protrusions that initiate collective invasion. Importantly, ΔNp63α is co-expressed with FAT2 and Slug in patient tumors and the elevated expression of ΔNp63α, FAT2 and Slug correlated with poor patient outcome. Together, these results reveal how ΔNp63α promotes cell migration by directly inducing the expression of a cohort of genes with distinct cellular functions and suggest that FAT2 is a new regulator of collective invasion that may influence patient outcome.""","""['Tuyen T Dang', 'Jill M Westcott', 'Erin A Maine', 'Mohammed Kanchwala', 'Chao Xing', 'Gray W Pearson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['ΔNp63α Promotes Breast Cancer Cell Motility through the Selective Activation of Components of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Program.', 'Loss of DeltaNp63alpha promotes invasion of urothelial carcinomas via N-cadherin/Src homology and collagen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.', 'Slug contributes to cadherin switch and malignant progression in muscle-invasive bladder cancer development.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of p63-Mediated Squamous Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'TP63 links chromatin remodeling and enhancer reprogramming to epidermal differentiation and squamous cell carcinoma development.', 'FAT2 mutation is associated with better prognosis and responsiveness to immunotherapy in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.', 'A Systemic and Integrated Analysis of p63-Driven Regulatory Networks in Mouse Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', '""In medio stat virtus"": Insights into hybrid E/M phenotype attitudes.', 'ΔNp63α in cancer: importance and therapeutic opportunities.', 'CPNE8 Promotes Gastric Cancer Metastasis by Modulating Focal Adhesion Pathway and Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Cores sampled only from areas of G3 were evaluated for PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry, and PTEN deletion, LPL/8p loss and MYC/8q gain by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

The clinical validity of various PCa risk assessment methods utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been established; however, these SNP-based methods have not been compared. The objective of this study was to compare the three most commonly used SNP-based methods for PCa risk assessment. Participants were men (n = 1654) enrolled in a prospective study of PCa development. Genotypes of 59 PCa risk-associated SNPs were available in this cohort. Three methods of calculating SNP-based genetic risk scores (GRSs) were used for the evaluation of individual disease risk such as risk allele count (GRS-RAC), weighted risk allele count (GRS-wRAC), and population-standardized genetic risk score (GRS-PS). Mean GRSs were calculated, and performances were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and positive predictive value (PPV). All SNP-based methods were found to be independently associated with PCa (all P < 0.05; hence their clinical validity). The mean GRSs in men with or without PCa using GRS-RAC were 55.15 and 53.46, respectively, using GRS-wRAC were 7.42 and 6.97, respectively, and using GRS-PS were 1.12 and 0.84, respectively (all P < 0.05 for differences between patients with or without PCa). All three SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa based on AUC and in predicting PCa risk based on PPV (all P > 0.05 for comparisons between the three methods), and all three SNP-based methods had a significantly higher AUC than family history (all P < 0.05). Results from this study suggest that while the three most commonly used SNP-based methods performed similarly in discriminating PCa from non-PCa at the population level, GRS-PS is the method of choice for risk assessment at the individual level because its value (where 1.0 represents average population risk) can be easily interpreted regardless of the number of risk-associated SNPs used in the calculation.""","""['Carly A Conran', 'Rong Na', 'Haitao Chen', 'Deke Jiang', 'Xiaoling Lin', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Charles B Brendler', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism-Based Genetic Risk Score and Patient Age at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Reclassification of prostate cancer risk using sequentially identified SNPs: Results from the REDUCE trial.', 'Race-specific genetic risk score is more accurate than nonrace-specific genetic risk score for predicting prostate cancer and high-grade diseases.', 'Clinical validity and utility of genetic risk scores in prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of genetic risk score with family history for estimating prostate cancer risk.', ""Antioxidant enzyme and DNA base repair genetic risk scores' associations with systemic oxidative stress biomarker in pooled cross-sectional studies."", 'Determining the role of genetic risk scores in symptomatic cancer detection.', 'A combined clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of ovarian cancer.', 'Novel clinical, molecular and bioinformatics insights into the genetic background of autism.', 'Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?']"""

Recently, epidemiologic evidence has indicated that history of diabetes mellitus (DM) is inversely associated with risk of PCa. However, epidemiological investigations have yielded inconsistent results. Hence, the exact mechanism of DM-induced reduction in the incidence of PCa has yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DM factors, including glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), on the proliferation of PCa cell lines in vitro. Cell proliferation and expression of hormone receptors was examined in MTT assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that DM factors did not affect the viability of androgen receptor (AR)-expressing PCa cell lines. However, cell proliferation increased after treatment with DM factors in androgen-independent PCa cell lines. On PCa tissue arrays, intensities of total AR and nuclear IGF-1R were higher in malignant tissues than in normal prostate glands. In terms of hormonal receptors, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells treated with insulin and IGF-1 in a low-serum medium showed decreased expression of insulin receptor beta (IRβ) and elevated expression of IGF-1 receptor beta (IGF-1Rβ). Moreover, expression of AR was upregulated after insulin and IGF-1 treatment in LNCaP cells, but not in the other PCa cell lines. Most of the studied antidiabetic drugs promoted the viability of PCa cells. However, metformin decreased the viability of AR-expressing PCa cells. These results suggest that diabetic factors modify the expression of AR, IR and IGF-1R to increase cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, the growth suppressing effects of metformin on PCa may be via the regulation of the AR signaling pathway.""","""['Shiaw-Wen Chien', 'Dong-Yih Kuo', 'Jiuan-Miaw Liao', 'Paulus S Wang', 'Ching-Han Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['The anticancer potential of metformin on prostate cancer.', 'Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression and signaling are components of androgen-independent progression in a lineage-derived prostate cancer progression model.', 'Comparative effects of DHEA vs. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol on proliferation and gene expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Bioactive Ingredients in K. pinnata Extract and Synergistic Effects of Combined K. pinnata and Metformin Preparations on Antioxidant Activities in Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Skeletal Muscle Cells.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin alters H2A.Z dynamics and regulates androgen dependent prostate cancer progression.', 'The anticancer potential of metformin on prostate cancer.', 'Metformin: A Bridge between Diabetes and Prostate Cancer.']"""

We evaluated the utility of a novel second-generation low molecular weight radiofluorinated prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [(18)F]DCFPyL, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Procedures:   Nine patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence, eight with CIM evidence of metastatic prostate cancer and one with biochemical recurrence, were imaged with [(18)F]DCFPyL PET/CT. Eight of the patients had contemporaneous CIM for comparison. A lesion-by-lesion comparison of the detection of suspected sites of metastatic prostate cancer was carried out between PET and CIM. Statistical analysis for estimated proportions of inter-modality agreement for detection of metastatic disease was calculated accounting for intra-patient correlation using general estimating equation (GEE) intercept-only regression models.  Results:   One hundred thirty-nine sites of PET positive [(18)F]DCFPyL uptake (138 definite, 1 equivocal) for metastatic disease were detected in the eight patients with available comparison CIM. By contrast, only 45 lesions were identified on CIM (30 definite, 15 equivocal). When lesions were negative or equivocal on CIM, it was estimated that a large portion of these lesions or 0.72 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.84) would be positive on [(18)F]DCFPyL PET. Conversely, of those lesions negative or equivocal on [(18)F]DCFPyL PET, it was estimated that only a very small proportion or 0.03 (95 % CI 0.01-0.07) would be positive on CIM. Delayed 2-h-post-injection time point PET yielded higher tumor radiotracer uptake and higher tumor-to-background ratios than an earlier 1-h-post-injection time point.  Conclusions:   A novel PSMA-targeted PET radiotracer, [(18)F]DCFPyL, was able to a large number of suspected sites of prostate cancer, many of which were occult or equivocal by CIM. This study provides strong preliminary evidence for the use of this second-generation PSMA-targeted PET radiotracer for detection of metastatic prostate cancer and lends further support for the importance of PSMA-targeted PET imaging in prostate cancer.""","""['Steven P Rowe', 'Katarzyna J Macura', 'Esther Mena', 'Amanda L Blackford', 'Rosa Nadal', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Michael Carducci', 'Hong Fan', 'Robert F Dannals', 'Ying Chen', 'Ronnie C Mease', 'Zsolt Szabo', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Steve Y Cho']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Inconsistent Detection of Sites of Metastatic Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma with PSMA-Targeted 18FDCFPyL PET/CT.', 'Comparison of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Based 18F-DCFBC PET/CT to Conventional Imaging Modalities for Detection of Hormone-Naïve and Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'The use of PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT versus 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer (PYTHON): a prospective, open label, cross-over, comparative study.', 'Future trends in incidence and long-term survival of metastatic cancer in the United States.', 'Assessment of 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT and PET/MR quantitative parameters for reference standard organs: Inter-reader, inter-modality, and inter-patient variability.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'The diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET in patients with suspected prostate cancer: A systemic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   In a multi-centric prospective study, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire-based potency of 91 hormone-naïve and potent patients (IIEF1-5 > 11 before radiotherapy) was assessed. At the time of this analysis, information on potency 1 year after treatment was available for 62 of 91 patients (42 treated with hypofractionation: 2.35-2.65 Gy/fr, 70-74.2 Gy; 20 with conventional fractionation: 74-78 Gy). Prospectively collected individual information and Dmax/Dmean to the penile bulb were available; the corresponding 2 Gy-equivalent values (EQD2_max/EQD2_mean) were also considered. Predictors of 1‑year impotency were assessed through uni- and multi-variable backward logistic regression: The best cut-off values discriminating between potent and impotent patients were assessed by ROC analyses. The discriminative power of the models and goodness-of-fit were measured by AUC analysis and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H&L) test.  Results:   At 1‑year follow-up, 26 of 62 patients (42 %) became impotent. The only predictive variables were baseline IIEF1-5 values (best cut-off baseline IIEF1-5 ≥ 19), Dmax ≥ 68.5 Gy and EQD2_max ≥ 74.2 Gy. The risk of 1‑year impotence may be predicted by a two-variable model including baseline IIEF1-5 (OR: 0.80, p = 0.003) and EQD2_max ≥ 74.2 Gy (OR: 4.1, p = 0.022). The AUC of the model was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64-0.87, p = 0.0007, H&L: p = 0.62). The 1‑year risk of impotency after high-dose radiotherapy in potent men depends on the EQD2_max to the penile bulb and on baseline IIEF1-5 values.

Cigarette smoking, a risk factor for prostate cancer death, has also declined. It is unknown whether declines in smoking prevalence produced detectable declines in prostate cancer mortality. We examined state prostate cancer mortality rates in relation to changes in cigarette smoking.  Methods:   We studied men aged 35 years or older from California, Kentucky, Maryland, and Utah. Data on state smoking prevalence were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Mortality rates for prostate cancer and external causes (control condition) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. The average annual percentage change from 1999 through 2010 was estimated using joinpoint analysis.  Results:   From 1999 through 2010, smoking in California declined by 3.5% per year (-4.4% to -2.5%), and prostate cancer mortality rates declined by 2.5% per year (-2.9% to -2.2%). In Kentucky, smoking declined by 3.0% per year (-4.0% to -1.9%) and prostate cancer mortality rates declined by 3.5% per year (-4.3% to -2.7%). In Maryland, smoking declined by 3.0% per year (-7.0% to 1.2%), and prostate cancer mortality rates declined by 3.5% per year (-4.1% to -3.0%).In Utah, smoking declined by 3.5% per year (-5.6% to -1.3%) and prostate cancer mortality rates declined by 2.1% per year (-3.8% to -0.4%). No corresponding patterns were observed for external causes of death.  Conclusion:   Declines in prostate cancer mortality rates appear to parallel declines in smoking prevalence at the population level. This study suggests that declines in prostate cancer mortality rates may be a beneficial effect of reduced smoking in the population.""","""['Miranda R Jones', 'Corinne E Joshu', 'Norma Kanarek', 'Ana Navas-Acien', 'Kelly A Richardson', 'Elizabeth A Platz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prev Chronic Dis""","""['CDC National Health Report: leading causes of morbidity and mortality and associated behavioral risk and protective factors--United States, 2005-2013.', 'Surveillance for certain health behaviors among selected local areas--United States, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2002.', 'State-Level Cancer Mortality Attributable to Cigarette Smoking in the United States.', 'Disease and injury in California with projections to the year 2007.

The targeted biopsy only strategy using magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image registration is gaining in popularity. We assessed the noninferiority of targeted vs systematic biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Between June and October 2014 a total of 108 biopsy naïve patients with prostate specific antigen between 4 and 20 ng/ml, normal rectal examination and a single suspicious image on magnetic resonance imaging were included in study at 7 centers. Patients underwent systematic biopsy by a first operator blinded to magnetic resonance imaging, immediately followed by 3 targeted biopsies within the suspicious image by a second operator. The primary end point was the cancer detection rate. The noninferiority margin was set at -5%. The secondary end points were the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (maximum cancer core length 5 mm or greater for Gleason 6 or any Gleason 7 or greater disease) and procedure duration.  Results:   Systematic and targeted biopsies detected cancer in 66 (61.1%) and 61 patients (56.5%), respectively. The mean difference was -4.5% with a 95% CI lower bound of -11.8%. A total of 13 patients with protocol violations were excluded from the per protocol analysis, which showed a mean difference of -5.2% with a 95% CI lower bound of -13.1%. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 50 (46.2%) and 52 patients (48.1%) with systematic and targeted biopsies, respectively (p = 0.69). The mean ± SD duration of image fusion plus targeted biopsy was 16.7 ± 7 minutes vs 7.4 ± 3 for systematic biopsy (p <0.001).

The diabetic drug, metformin, has been shown to have antineoplastic properties and demonstrated better treatment outcomes when used as adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. The hormonally-sensitive cancer analogous to breast cancer in men is prostate cancer. We investigated improved survival, lower risks of recurrences, and lower, more stable levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients with DM2 along with prostate cancer on metformin.  Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer along with DM2 who remained on metformin were compared with controls who were not on metformin matched by age, weight, race and Gleason score cancer staging. The endpoints of our study included final PSA values, number of recurrences, metastases and number living for each group.  Results:   There were significantly fewer deaths (23% versus 10%), fewer recurrences (15% versus 8%), fewer metastases (5% versus 0%) and fewer secondary cancers (17% versus 6%) in the metformin group (P < 0.004). The final PSA value was lower in the metformin-treated group with a result approaching significance (P = 0.067). The primary treatments for prostate cancer (ie, surgery, radiation and androgen depletion) were found to be comparable in both the groups.  Conclusions:   Our retrospective study shows that adjuvant metformin therapy leads to a better prognosis in prostate cancer. Not only are PSA levels controlled for several years but also there are significantly fewer cancer recurrences in metformin-treated patients. Overall, these results are promising and should be followed up with a prospective study to assess long-term survival.""","""['R William Chong', 'Vijaya Vasudevan', 'Jeffrey Zuber', 'Solomon S Solomon']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Med Sci""","""['Metformin Has Positive Therapeutic Effects in Colon Cancer and Lung Cancer.', 'Metformin Use is Associated with Improved Survival for Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'A review for clinicians: Prostate cancer and the antineoplastic properties of metformin.', 'Metformin, an antidiabetic molecule with anti-cancer properties.', 'Diabetes, metformin use, and survival in esophageal cancer: a population-based cohort study.', ""Drug repurposing: Metformin's effect against liver tissue damage in diabetes and prostate cancer model."", 'Metformin exerts an antitumoral effect on papillary thyroid cancer cells through altered cell energy metabolism and sensitized by BACH1 depletion.', 'The Effect of Metformin on Male Reproductive Function and Prostate: An Updated Review.', 'Metformin: Possible Use of a Diabetes Drug in Treatment of Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We sampled 44,521 men older than 65 with cT1-2, poorly differentiated prostate cancer diagnosed in 1991-2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. We used propensity-adjusted, competing-risks regression to calculate 5- and 10-year cancer mortality among those treated aggressively and nonaggressively across comorbidity subgroups. We determined 5- and 10-year absolute risk reduction in cancer mortality and numbers needed to treat to prevent one cancer death at 10 years.  Results:   In propensity-adjusted, competing-risks regression analysis, aggressive treatment was associated with significantly lower risk of cancer mortality for those with Charlson scores of 0 (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.47), 1 (SHR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.58), and 2 (SHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.62) but not 3+ (SHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44-1.07). Absolute reductions in cancer mortality between those treated aggressively and nonaggressively were 7%, 5.5%, 6.9%, and 2.5% at 5 years, and 11.3%, 7.9%, 8.6%, and 2.8% at 10 years for men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3+ , respectively; numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 cancer death at 10 years were 9, 13, 12, and 36 men.

This includes the Nuclear-factor-kappa-B (NFκB) pathway, which is central to the inflammatory response and cell proliferation in prostate cancer development and progression. Despite close scrutiny and a deep understanding of many of its members' biomolecular activities, the current list of pathway members and a systems-level understanding of their interactions remains incomplete. Here, we provide the first steps toward computational reconstruction of interaction mechanisms of the NFκB pathway in prostate cancer. We identified novel roles for ATF3, CXCL2, DUSP5, JUNB, NEDD9, SELE, TRIB1, and ZFP36 in this pathway, in addition to new mechanistic interactions between these genes and 10 known NFκB pathway members. A newly predicted interaction between NEDD9 and ZFP36 in particular was validated by co-immunoprecipitation, as was NEDD9's potential biological role in prostate cancer cell growth regulation. We combined 651 gene expression datasets with 1.4M gene product interactions to predict the inclusion of 40 additional genes in the pathway. Molecular mechanisms of interaction among pathway members were inferred using recent advances in Bayesian data integration to simultaneously provide information specific to biological contexts and individual biomolecular activities, resulting in a total of 112 interactions in the fully reconstructed NFκB pathway: 13 (11%) previously known, 29 (26%) supported by existing literature, and 70 (63%) novel.

Materials and methods:   One hundred sixty-five patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI followed by radical prostatectomy. ADC and ADC ratios were calculated using the peripheral zone, transition zone, same zone as the tumor, and urinary bladder as references. ADC and ADC ratios were correlated with Gleason score using the Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and were compared between low-grade (Gleason score = 6) and high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 7) prostate cancer using the unpaired t test. ROC curves were used to compare diagnostic accuracies of ADC and ADC ratios in determining high-grade prostate cancer.  Results:   Fifty-six (33.9%) and 109 (66.1%) patients had low- and high-grade prostate cancer, respectively. ADC (ρ = -0.476) and all ADC ratios (ρ = -0.397, -0.412, -0.381, and -0.474, respectively) correlated significantly with Gleason score (p < 0.001) and were significantly lower in patients with high-grade prostate cancer (p < 0.001). For predicting high-grade prostate cancer, tumor ADC and tumor-to-urinary bladder ADC ratio showed the highest AUC (0.794 and 0.790, respectively) but without statistically significant difference (p = 0.803). AUC of tumor ADC (0.794) was statistically significantly higher than those of the tumor-to-peripheral zone and tumor-to-transition zone ADC ratios (0.746, p = 0.039; 0.751, p = 0.027; respectively). AUC of tumor ADC was not statistically significantly higher than that of the tumor-to-tumor zone ADC ratio (0.763, p = 0.193). AUC calculated using the tumor-to-urinary bladder ADC ratio was statistically significantly higher than that using the tumor-to-transition zone ADC ratio (p = 0.028) and marginally higher than that from tumor-to-peripheral zone ADC ratio (p = 0.080). Otherwise, no significant differences were seen in the AUCs (p = 0.193-0.828).  Conclusion:   Both ADC and various ADC ratios correlated significantly with Gleason score and were significant predictors of high-grade prostate cancer.

The efficacy of current interventions, principal treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors, is not satisfactory and this condition presents an unmet medical need. Preclinical studies using adipose-derived stem cells to treat ED have shown promising results. Herein, we report the results of a human phase 1 trial with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) freshly isolated after a liposuction.  Methods:   Seventeen men suffering from post RP ED, with no recovery using conventional therapy, were enrolled in a prospective phase 1 open-label and single-arm study. All subjects had RP performed 5-18 months before enrolment, and were followed for 6 months after intracavernosal transplantation. ADRCs were analyzed for the presence of stem cell surface markers, viability and ability to differentiate. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerance of the cell therapy while the secondary outcome was improvement of erectile function. Any adverse events were reported and erectile function was assessed by IIEF-5 scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02240823.  Findings:   Intracavernous injection of ADRCs was well-tolerated and only minor events related to the liposuction and cell injections were reported at the one-month evaluation, but none at later time points. Overall during the study period, 8 of 17 men recovered their erectile function and were able to accomplish sexual intercourse. Post-hoc stratification according to urinary continence status was performed. Accordingly, for continent men (median IIEFinclusion = 7 (95% CI 5-12), 8 out of 11 men recovered erectile function (IIEF6months = 17 (6-23)), corresponding to a mean difference of 0.57 (0.38-0.85; p = 0.0069), versus inclusion. In contrast, incontinent men did not regain erectile function (median IIEF1/3/6 months = 5 (95% CI 5-6); mean difference 1 (95% CI 0.85-1.18), p > 0.9999).  Interpretation:   In this phase I trial a single intracavernosal injection of freshly isolated autologous ADRCs was a safe procedure. A potential efficacy is suggested by a significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores and erectile function. We suggest that ADRCs represent a promising interventional therapy of ED following prostatectomy.

Moreover, it has been in the spotlight in the recent years as a promising new target for therapy of breast cancer.  Objective:   Since virtual screening has become an integral part of the drug discovery process, it is of great significant to identify novel HER2 inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening.  Materials and methods:   In this study, we carried out a series of elegant bioinformatics approaches, such as virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify HER2 inhibitors from Food and Drug Administration-approved small molecule drug as potential ""new use"" drugs.  Results:   Molecular docking identified top 10 potential drugs which showed spectrum affinity to HER2. Moreover, MD simulations suggested that ZINC08214629 (Nonoxynol-9) and ZINC03830276 (Benzonatate) might exert potential inhibitory effects against HER2-targeted anti-breast cancer therapeutics.  Conclusion:   Together, our findings may provide successful application of virtual screening studies in the lead discovery process, and suggest that our discovered small molecules could be effective HER2 inhibitor candidates for further study.

Methods:   Data for the descriptive qualitative study were collected in interviews. The author applied a phenomenological-hermeneutic frame of understanding.  Results:   Four themes appeared in the analysis of the interviews: lack of control, sense of self, intimate relations and redefining sexuality.  Conclusion:   Men experience erectile dysfunction as a negative influence on their sexuality with respect to their sex life, sense of self and intimate relations. The dysfunction is thus shown not only to affect sexual life but also to have repercussions for a range of aspects in male intimate life.

Methods:   We reviewed the medical records of 1905 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2007 and 2015. All ADC images were graded using the five-grade Likert scale; the positive hypointense lesions were graded 4-5. We analyzed 256 patients with low-risk classifications according to D'Amico criteria. Patients were classified into two groups according to the pathologic upgrading in the surgical specimens. The predictive factors for pathologic upgrading were evaluated using a multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   In 256 patients with low-risk PCa, the percentage of positive cores [odds ratio (OR) 1.09; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.16], the percentage of cancer in the positive cores (OR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.03-1.12), and the presence of hypointensity on an ADC map (OR 2.28; 95 % CI 1.23-4.22) were independent predictors of pathologic upgrading.

However, recent studies have brought to light the complexity of TRPM8 isoforms in PCa. Consequently, the respective role of each TRPM8 isoform needs to be deciphered prior to considering TRPM8 as an attractive therapeutic target. Full-length (6 transmembrane (TM)-domain) TRPM8 channel is overexpressed in early PCa and repressed in advanced prostate tumors whereas the localization of the truncated, 4TM-TRPM8 channel (4 transmembrane (TM)-domain), in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is independent of the pathogenic status of epithelial cells. In the same line, expression of non-channel cytoplasmic small TRPM8 isoforms (namely sM8) is conserved in cancer cells. In this study, we identify sM8s as putative regulator of PCa cell death. Indeed, suppression of sM8 isoforms was found to induce concomitantly ER stress, oxidative stress, p21 expression and apoptosis in human epithelial prostate cancer cells. We furthermore demonstrate that induction of such mechanisms required the activity of 4TM-TRPM8 channels at the ER-mitochondria junction.

Short-arc digital tomosynthesis (SA-DTS) is used to improve the quality of the MV images that are then combined with orthogonally acquired kV images to assess 3D motion. An anthropomorphic phantom with implanted gold seeds was used to assess accuracy of the method under static, typical prostatic, and respiratory motion scenarios. Automatic registra-tion of kV images and single MV frames or MV SA-DTS reconstructed with arc lengths from 2° to 7° with the appropriate reference fiducial template images was performed using special purpose-built software. Clinical feasibility was evaluated by retrospectively analyzing images acquired over four or five sessions for each of three patients undergoing hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy. The standard deviation of the registration error in phantom using MV SA-DTS was similar to single MV images for the static and prostate motion scenarios (σ = 0.25 mm). Under respiratory motion conditions, the standard deviation of the registration error increased to 0.7mm and 1.7 mm for single MV and MV SA-DTS, respectively. Registration failures were observed with the respiratory scenario only and were due to motion-induced fiducial blurring. For the three patients studied, the mean and standard deviation of the difference between automatic registration using 4° MV SA-DTS and manual registration using single MV images results was 0.07±0.52mm. The MV SA-DTS results in patients were, on average, superior to single-frame MV by nearly 1 mm - significantly more than what was observed in phantom. The best MV SA-DTS results were observed with arc lengths of 3° to 4°. Registration failures in patients using MV SA-DTS were primarily due to blockage of the gold seeds by the MLC.

The lack of correlations between usual 2D pretreatment QA results and the clinical impact of possible mistakes has allowed the development of 3D verification systems. Dose determination on patient anatomy has provided clinical predictive capability to patient-specific QA process. Dose-volume metrics, as evaluation criteria, should be replaced or complemented by radiobiological indices. These metrics can be incorporated into individualized QA extracting the information for response parameters (gEUD, TCP, NTCP) from DVHs. The aim of this study is to assess the role of two 3D verification systems dealing with radiobiological metrics applied to a prostate VMAT QA program. Radiobiological calculations were performed for AAPM TG-166 test cases. Maximum differences were 9.3% for gEUD, -1.3% for TCP, and 5.3% for NTCP calculations. Gamma tests and DVH-based comparisons were carried out for both systems in order to assess their performance in 3D dose determination for prostate treatments (high-, intermediate-, and low-risk, as well as prostate bed patients). Mean gamma passing rates for all structures were bet-ter than 92.0% and 99.1% for both 2%/2 mm and 3%/3 mm criteria. Maximum discrepancies were (2.4% ± 0.8%) and (6.2% ± 1.3%) for targets and normal tis-sues, respectively. Values for gEUD, TCP, and NTCP were extracted from TPS and compared to the results obtained with the two systems. Three models were used for TCP calculations (Poisson, sigmoidal, and Niemierko) and two models for NTCP determinations (LKB and Niemierko). The maximum mean difference for gEUD calculations was (4.7% ± 1.3%); for TCP, the maximum discrepancy was (-2.4% ± 1.1%); and NTCP comparisons led to a maximum deviation of (1.5% ± 0.5%). The potential usefulness of biological metrics in patient-specific QA has been explored. Both systems have been successfully assessed as potential tools for evaluating the clinical outcome of a radiotherapy treatment in the scope of pretreatment QA.""","""['Francisco Clemente-Gutiérrez', 'Consuelo Pérez-Vara', 'María H Clavo-Herranz', 'Concepción López-Carrizosa', 'José Pérez-Regadera', 'Carmen Ibáñez-Villoslada']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Novel Radiobiological Gamma Index for Evaluation of 3-Dimensional Predicted Dose Distribution.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison of prostate VMAT plans optimized using the photon and progressive resolution algorithm.', 'Dosimetric validation and clinical implementation of two 3D dose verification systems for quality assurance in volumetric-modulated arc therapy techniques.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'Modeling clinical outcomes in radiotherapy: NTCP, TCP and the ""TECs"".', 'Incorporating biological modeling into patient-specific plan verification.', 'Simulation analysis for tumor radiotherapy based on three-component mathematical models.', 'Comparison of Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Whole Brain Hippocampal Sparing Treatment Plans Based on Radiobiological Modeling.', 'Assessing the shift of radiobiological metrics in lung radiotherapy plans using 2D gamma index.']"""

Three clinical examples (prostate, head and neck (HN), and cranial spinal irradiation (CSI) with L-spine boost) were evaluated in this study. Firstly, computerized deformed CT images were generated using simulation QA software with virtual deformations of bladder filling (prostate), neck flexion/bite-block repositioning/tumor shrinkage (HN), and vertebral body rotation (CSI). The corresponding transformation matrices served as a ""reference"" for the following comparisons. Three commercialized DIR algorithms: the free-form deformation from MIMVista 5.5 and the RegRefine from MIMMaestro 6.0, the multipass B-spline from VelocityAI v3.0.1, and the adap-tive demons from OnQ rts 2.1.15, were applied between the initial images and the deformed CT sets. The generated adaptive contours and dose distributions were compared with the ""reference"" and among each other. The performance in transfer-ring contours was comparable among all three tools with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.81 for all the organs. However, the dose warping accuracy appeared to rely on the evaluation end points and methodologies. Point-dose differences could show a difference of up to 23.3 Gy inside the PTVs and to overestimate up to 13.2 Gy for OARs, which was substantial for a 72 Gy prescription dose. Dose-volume histogram-based evaluation might not be sensitive enough to illustrate all the detailed variations, while isodose assessment on a slice-by-slice basis could be tedious. We further explored the possibility of using 3D gamma index analysis for warping dose variation assessment, and observed differences in dose warping using different DIR tools. Overall, our results demonstrated that evaluation based only on the performance of contour transformation could not guarantee the accuracy in dose warping, while dose-transferring validation strongly relied on the evaluation endpoint. As dose-transferring errors could cause misinterpretations when attempting to accumulate dose for adaptive radiation therapy and more DIR tools are available for clinical use, a standard and clinically meaningful quality assurance criterion should be established for DIR QA in the near future.""","""['Ke Nie', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Eric Smith', 'Cynthia Chuang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comprehensive evaluation of ten deformable image registration algorithms for contour propagation between CT and cone-beam CT images in adaptive head & neck radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Evaluation of the accuracy of deformable image registration on MRI with a physical phantom.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Roles of Deformable Image Registration in adaptive RT: From contour propagation to dose monitoring.', 'Assessing cumulative dose distributions in combined external beam radiotherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer by treatment planning based on deformable image registration.', 'Assessment of CT to CBCT contour mapping for radiomic feature analysis in prostate cancer.', 'Dose Summation Strategies for External Beam Radiation Therapy and Brachytherapy in Gynecologic Malignancy: A Review from the NRG Oncology and NCTN Medical Physics Subcommittees.', 'Validation of accuracy deformable image registration contour propagation using a benchmark virtual HN phantom dataset.', 'Clinical use, challenges, and barriers to implementation of deformable image registration in radiotherapy - the need for guidance and QA tools.']"""

This study aimed to inves-tigate the accuracy and repeatability of the MLC leaf positioning via the DAVID invivo dosimetric system for dynamic and static MLC systems. The DAVID system was designed as multiwire transmission ionization chamber which is placed in accessory holder of linear accelerators. Each wire of DAVID system corresponds to a MLC leaf-pair to verify the leaf positioning accuracy during IMRT treatment and QA. In this study, verifications of IMRT plans of five head and neck (H&N) and five prostate patients treated in a Varian DHX linear accelerator with 80-leaf MLC were performed using DAVID system. Before DAVID-based dosimetry, Electronics Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and PTW 2D ARRAY dosimetry system were used for 2D verification of each plan. The measurements taken by DAVID system in the first day of the treatments were used as reference for the following measurements taken over the next four weeks. The deviations in leaf positioning were evaluated by ""Total Deviation (TD)"" parameter calculated by DAVID software. The delivered IMRT plans were originally prepared using dynamic MLC method. The same plans were subsequently calculated based on static MLC method with three different intensity levels of five (IL5), 10 (IL10) and 20 (IL20) in order to compare the performances of MLC leaf positioning repeatability for dynamic and static IMRT plans. The leaf positioning accuracy is also evaluated by analyzing DynaLog files based on error histograms and root mean square (RMS) errors of leaf pairs' positions. Moreover, a correlation analysis between simultaneously taken DAVID and EPID measurements and DynaLog file recordings was subsequently performed. In the analysis of DAVID outputs, the overall deviations of dynamic MLC-based IMRT calculated from the deviations of the four weeks were found as 0.55% ± 0.57% and 1.48% ± 0.57% for prostate and H&N patients, respectively. The prostate IMRT plans based on static MLC method had the overall deviations of 1.23% ± 0.69%, 3.07% ± 1.07%, and 3.13% ± 1.29% for intensity levels of IL5, IL10, and IL20, respectively. Moreover, the overall deviations for H&N patients were found as 1.87% ± 0.86%, 3.11% ± 1.24%, and 2.78% ± 1.31% for the static MLC-based IMRT plans with intensity levels of IL5, IL10 and IL20, respectively. Similar with the DAVID results, the error rates in DynaLog files showed upward movement comparing the dynamic IMRT with static IMRT with high intensity levels. In respect to positioning errors higher than 0.005 cm, static prostate IMRT plans with intensity levels of IL10 and IL20 had 1.5 and 2.6 times higher error ratios than dynamic prostate IMRT plans, respectively, while these values stepped up to 8.4 and 12.0 for H&N cases. On the other hand, according to the leaf pair readings, reconstructed dose values from DynaLog files had significant correlation (r = 0.80) with DAVID and EPID readings while a stronger relationship (r = 0.98) was found between the two dosimetric systems. The correlation coefficients for deviations from reference plan readings were found in the interval of -0.21-0.16 for all three systems. The dynamic MLC method showed higher performance in repeatability of leaf positioning than static MLC methods with higher intensity levels even though the deviations in the MLC leaf positioning were found to be under the acceptance threshold for all MLC methods. The high intensity levels increased the position-ing deviations along with the delivery complexity of the static MLC-based IMRT plans. Moreover, DAVID and EPID readings and DynaLog recordings showed mutually strong correlation, while no significant relationship was found between deviations from reference values.""","""['Gulay Karagoz', 'Faruk Zorlu', 'Mete Yeginer', 'Demet Yildiz', 'Gokhan Ozyigit']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'A Varian DynaLog file-based procedure for patient dose-volume histogram-based IMRT QA.', 'Comparison of MLC positioning deviations using log files and establishment of specific assessment parameters for different accelerators with IMRT and VMAT.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Effect of Multileaf Collimator Leaf Position Error Determined by Picket Fence Test on Gamma Index Value in Patient-Specific Quality Assurance of Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy Plans.']"""

We narrowed down the minimally amplified area and assessed the frequency of the 9p13.3 amplification. Of the clinical samples from untreated PCs that were examined (n = 134), 9.7% showed high-level amplification, and 32.1% showed low-level amplification.

It has been suggested that polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism are risk factors for prostate cancer. However, few studies have been performed on populations of African ancestry, which are known to have a high risk of prostate cancer.  Objective:   We investigated whether functional polymorphisms of CYP17, CYP19, CYP1B1, COMT and UGT1A1 affected the risk of prostate cancer in two different populations of African ancestry.  Methods:   In Guadeloupe (French West Indies), we compared 498 prostate cancer patients and 565 control subjects. In Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo), 162 prostate cancer patients were compared with 144 controls. Gene polymorphisms were determined by the SNaPshot technique or short tandem repeat PCR analysis. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   The AA genotype and the A allele of rs4680 (COMT) appeared to be inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer in adjusted models for both Afro-Caribbean and native African men. For the A allele, a significant inverse association was observed among cases with low-grade Gleason scores and localized clinical stage, in both populations.

In contrast to previous reports of PMSA-targeting (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl complexes that are cationic or lack a charge, no anionic (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl complexes have been reported. Notably, the hydrophilicity conferred by both cationic and anionic charges leads to rapid hepatobiliary clearance, whereas an anionic charge might better enhance renal clearance relative to a cationic charge. Therefore, an improvement in rapid clearance would be expected with either cationic or anionic charges, particularly anionic charges. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel anionic (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl complex ([(99m)Tc]TMCE) and evaluated its use as a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging probe for PSMA detection. Direct synthesis of [(99m)Tc]TMCE from dimethyl iminodiacetate, which contains both the asymmetric urea and succinimidyl moiety important for PSMA binding, was performed using our microwave-assisted one-pot procedure. The chelate formation was successfully achieved even though the precursor included a complicated bioactive moiety. The radiochemical yield of [(99m)Tc]TMCE was 12-17%, with a radiochemical purity greater than 98% after HPLC purification. [(99m)Tc]TMCE showed high affinity in vitro, with high accumulation in LNCaP tumors and low hepatic retention in biodistribution and SPECT/CT studies.

This research reconstructed bladder dose using both hollow and solid organ models, to determine if dose/volume differences exist.  Materials and methods:   35 prostate IMRT patients were selected, who had received 78Gy in 39 fractions and full bladder instructions. Biomechanical modelling and finite element analysis were used to reconstruct bladder dose (solid and hollow organ model) using every third CBCT throughout the treatment course.  Results:   Reconstructed dose (ReconDose) was 11.3Gy greater than planned dose (planDose) with a hollow bladder model (p<0.001) and 12.3Gy greater with a solid bladder model (p<0.0001). Median reconstructed volumes within the 30Gy, 65Gy and 78Gy isodoses were 3-4 times larger with the solid organ model (p<0.0001). The difference between planning bladder volume and median treatment volume was associated with the difference between the planDose and reconDose below 78Gy (R(2)>0.61).  Conclusions:   Substantial differences exist between planned and reconstructed bladder dose, associated with the differences in bladder filling between planning and treatment. Dose reconstructed using a solid bladder model over-reports the volume of bladder within key isodose levels and overestimates the differences between planned and reconstructed dose.

This study describes CaP characteristics and outcomes in Australian young men.  Methods:   The South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative database was used to identify men diagnosed with CaP 1998-2012. Men were stratified by age at diagnosis into groups ≤50, 50-70 and ≥70 years. Primary outcomes of cumulative biochemical recurrence (BCR) and cumulative prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were assessed at 5 and 10 years.  Results:   In total, 7018 men were included. At time of diagnosis, 182 (2.6 %) were aged ≤50 years. Median follow-up exceeded 4 years. Younger men had a greater proportion of T stage <2 disease, lower median PSA and higher rates of Gleason score <7 (all p < 0.001). They were more likely to experience active surveillance (AS) (4.9, 3.1, 1.5 %) or radical prostatectomy (RP) (70, 55, 8 %) and less likely radiotherapy (13, 24, 29 %) as their principal modality (all p < 0.001). Although only 4.9 % underwent AS, 48 % of men ≤50 years were eligible for AS. Men ≤50 years had both the lowest unadjusted cumulative BCR and PCSM at 10 years. After multivariate analysis, BCR was not significantly different. Sample size limited multivariate analysis of PCSM.  Conclusions:   In our cohort, men ≤50 years with CaP had less aggressive clinical characteristics, but were more likely to undergo RP. They appear to experience lower unadjusted PCSM, but similar rates of adjusted BCR. Further studies are needed to assess whether AS is appropriately utilised in these men.""","""['N J Kinnear', 'G Kichenadasse', 'S Plagakis', ""M E O'Callaghan"", 'T Kopsaftis', 'S Walsh', 'D Foreman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Positive surgical margins in radical prostatectomy patients do not predict long-term oncological outcomes: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) cohort.', 'Initial management of prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death from prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Prostate cancer in young men: an important clinical entity.', 'Width of spared neurovascular bundle after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer: is it a reliable factor for predicting postoperative sexual outcome?', 'Prostate cancer in young men represents a distinct clinical phenotype: gene expression signature to predict early metastases.', 'Impact of Grade Groups on Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality: Competing Risk Analysis from a Large Single Institution Series.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer in younger men aged\xa0≤\xa050\xa0years treated with radical prostatectomy in the PSA era: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Age and aggressiveness of prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and pathological characteristics after radical prostatectomy for men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Thirteen patients undergoing prostate cancer radiotherapy were consecutively selected for this study. All patients were treated with IMRT to a dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions. Three different rectum volumes: (i) planned rectum (plan-rectum) (ii) Boolean sum of rectum volume based on the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for first five fractions (planning organ at risk volumes [PRV]-CBCT-5), (iii) Boolean sum of rectum volume from all the CBCTs (PRV-CBCT-All) in addition to an average rectal complication (PRV-CBCT-AV) were used for computing the probabilities of rectal complications. To assess the rectal complications with 3D-CRT, a five-field plan was generated for comparison with IMRT. The Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was used to assess the rectal complications for all of the defined rectal volumes.  Results:   The NTCPs for rectum as assessed from plan-rectum, PRV-CBCT-5, PRV-CBCT-All, and PRV-CBCT-AV with IMRT were 9.71% ±4.69%, 16.34% ±9.51%, 19.39% ±9.71%, and 12.81% ±7.22%, respectively. Similarly, with 3D-CRT, the NTCPs were 17.41% ±10.44%, 19.61% ±11.08%, 21.03% ±11.06%, and 17.72% ±10.29%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our results showed that the rectal complications are reduced significantly with IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT. As such, the analyses of NTCP with various defined composite rectum volumes indicate that IMRT requires image-guided adaptive radiotherapy as opposed to 3D-CRT.""","""['Ramachandran Prabhakar', 'Richard Oates', 'Jones Daryl', 'Joe Chang', 'Moshi Geso', 'Jim Cramb']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['A study on planning organ at risk volume for the rectum using cone beam computed tomography in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetry and radiobiologic model comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy in treatment of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'The Usefulness of Adaptative Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: How, When, and Who?']"""

The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the androgen receptor (AR) expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and prostatic adenocarcinoma. A relationship between the Gleason score and AR expression was also determined in cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Materials and methods:   A total of 25 cases were collected which included 10 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of BPH, and five cases of PIN. Histopathological evaluation was done to determine the type of lesion including Gleason scoring. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for AR using monoclonal anti-AR antibody.  Results:   Specific AR immunostaining was present in all 25 cases in varying intensity. The staining was more intense in cases of adenocarcinoma and PIN as compared BPH. There was no significant statistical difference in the intensity of staining of AR. The Gleason score was inversely related to the intensity of AR staining in adenocarcinoma. There was no significant statistical association between the AR expression and tumor, necrosis, metastasis (TNM) stage.  Discussion:   AR nuclear expression is present in benign and malignant prostatic epithelium. In this study, cases of prostate cancer demonstrated a higher staining intensity for AR when compared with BPH. The intensity of AR staining in prostate cancer significantly reduces as the Gleason grade of the tumor increases. The staining intensity for AR was heterogeneous specifically in cases of prostate cancer. Our results indicate that AR maybe considered as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer.""","""['Irma Husain', 'Saumya Shukla', 'Priyanka Soni', 'Nuzhat Husain']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Androgen receptor expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.', 'Amphiregulin expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma: a study of 93 cases.', 'Transforming growth factor beta 1 and androgen receptors in prostate neoplasia.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Molecular biology of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Androgen and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Different Types of Perianal Gland Tumors in Male Dogs.', 'Development and prevalence of castration-resistant prostate cancer subtypes.', 'The Effect of Zinc, Selenium, and Their Combined Supplementation on Androgen Receptor Protein Expression in the Prostate Lobes and Serum Steroid Hormone Concentrations of Wistar Rats.', 'Milk disrupts p53 and DNMT1, the guardians of the genome: implications for acne vulgaris and prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   After excluding criteria, the records of 220 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) were retrospectively reviewed. Serum samples of PSA, total testosterone (TT) and FT were collected at 8.00 A.M., one month after biopsies and before RP. The PSA/FT ratio was computed in the population of patients who were clustered in groups according to ranking intervals of the PSA/FT ratio which identified at least 4 clusters which were coded as A, B, C, and D. The independent associations of the PSA/FT index ratio were assessed by statistical methods and a two-sided P &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.  Results:   TT correlated to FT which was a significant predictor of PSA in the population of patients who were subsequently clustered, according to increasing interval values of the PSA/FT index ratio, in groups that showed a stronger linear association of FT with PSA. The PSA/FT index ratio significantly associated with pathology features of prostate cancer such as pathology Gleason score (pGS), invasion of the seminal vesicles (pT3b), proportion of positive cores (P+) and proportion of cancer involving the volume of the prostate. In the population of patients, TT, PSA/FT index ratio and P+ independently associated with pGS ≥ 7 and pT3b; moreover, the odds ratio (OR) of the PSA/FT index ratio resulted 9.11 which was stronger than TT (OR = 1.11) and P+ (OR = 8.84). In the PCA population, TT, PSA/FT index ratio and P+ also independently associated with pT3b PCA; interestingly, the OR of PSA/FT index resulted 54.91 which was stronger than TT (OR = 1.31) and P+ (26.43).  Conclusions:   Preoperative PSA/FT index ratio is an independent strong factor which directly associates with aggressive features of pathology PCA; moreover, it might express prognostic potential for clustering the patient population in risk classes.

Methods:   Thirty-one consecutive male patients were screened to be enrolled in a single center prospective observational study. All eligible patients underwent multi-parametric MRI and TRUS (Trans Rectal Ultra Sound) guided prostate biopsies. A register, approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee, included patients enrolled in this study. All patients who decided to undergo the MRI examination signed an explicit informed consensus. MRI data were aligned on a common spatial grid and several functional parameters (perfusion, diffusion and metabolic parameters) were computed. Statistical analysis was conducted in order to compare mpMRI with biopsy-based analysis.  Results:   Statistically significant differences between median values in high Gleason score (≥5) and low Gleason score (<5) to Wilcox on rank sum test were obtained for MRSI parameters and for plasma fraction (Tofts model) of DCE-MRI. The area under curve obtained with ROC analysis showed that the best-performing single-parameter was vp (plasma fraction of Tofts model), while the best parameters combination to discriminate the area with high Gleason score were (Cho+Cr)/Cit and Cho+Cr. Linear Discrimination Analysis showed that the best results were obtained considering the linear combination of all MRSI parameters and the linear combination of all features (perfusion, diffusion and metabolic parameters).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, our findings showed that by combining morphological MRI, DWI, DCE-MRI and MRSI, an increase in sensitivity and specificity correlated to biopsy Gleason grade could be obtained.

Our aim is study the dosimetric impact of uniform relative electron density assignment on IMRT treatment planning with additional consideration given to the effect of a 1.5 T transverse magnetic field (TMF) in MR-Linac. A series of intensity modulated RT (IMRT) plans were generated for two representative tumor sites, pancreas and prostate, using CT and MRI datasets. Representative CT-based IMRT plans were generated to assess the impact of different electron density (ED) assignment on plan quality using CT without the presence of a 1.5 T TMF. The relative ED (rED) values used were taken from the ICRU report 46. Four types of rED assignment in the organs at risk (OARs), the planning target volumes (PTV) and in the non-specified tissue (NST) were considered. Dose was recalculated (no optimization) using a Monaco 5.09.07a research planning system employing Monte Carlo calculations with an option to include TMF. To investigate the dosimetric effect of different rED assignment, the dose-volume parameters (DVPs) obtained from these specific rED plans were compared to those obtained from the original plans based on CT. Overall, we found that uniform rED assignment results in differences in DVPs within 3% for the PTV and 5% for OAR. The presence of 1.5 T TMF on IMRT DVPs resulted in differences that were generally within 3% of the Gold St for both the pancreas and prostate. The combination of uniform rED assignment and TMF produced differences in DVPs that were within 4-5% of the Gold St. Larger differences in DVPs were observed for OARs on T2-based plans. The effects of using different rED assignments and the presence of 1.5 T TMF for pancreas and prostate IMRT plans are generally within 3% and 5% of PTV and OAR Gold St values. There are noticeable dosimetric differences between the CT- and MRI-based IMRT plans caused by a combination of anatomical changes between the two image acquisition times, uniform rED assignment and 1.5 T TMF.""","""['Phil Prior', 'Xinfeng Chen', 'Maikel Botros', 'Eric S Paulson', 'Colleen Lawton', 'Beth Erickson', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Technical Note: Is bulk electron density assignment appropriate for MRI-only based treatment planning for lung cancer?', 'Dosimetric comparison of MR-linac-based IMRT and conventional VMAT treatment plans for prostate cancer.', 'MRI-based treatment planning for radiotherapy: dosimetric verification for prostate IMRT.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Imaging for Target Delineation and Treatment Planning in Radiation Oncology: Current and Emerging Techniques.', 'Dosimetric Accuracy of MR-Guided Online Adaptive Planning for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy on 1.5 T MR-Linac.', 'Magnetic resonance linear accelerator technology and adaptive radiation therapy: An overview for clinicians.', 'A preferred patient decubitus positioning for magnetic resonance image guided online adaptive radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'Planning feasibility of extremely hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy on a 1.5\u202fT magnetic resonance imaging guided linear accelerator.', 'On the accuracy of bulk synthetic CT for MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy.']"""

Although the inhibition of androgen receptor signaling has been supposed as one mechanism underlying their effects, the precise mechanism of androgen receptor inhibition remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to clarify their mechanism. Among soy isoflavones, equol suppressed androgen receptor as well as prostate-specific antigen expression most potently in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. However, the inhibitory effect on androgen receptor expression and activity was less prominent in castration-resistant CxR and 22Rv1 cells. Consistently, cell proliferation was suppressed and cellular apoptosis was induced by equol in LNCaP cells, but less so in CxR and 22Rv1 cells. We revealed that the proteasome pathway through S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) was responsible for androgen receptor suppression. Taken together, soy isoflavones, especially equol, appear to be promising as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents for prostate cancer based on the fact that equol augments Skp2-mediated androgen receptor degradation.

In the microenvironment of HCC, GP73 expression levels are significantly elevated. It is this elevation that may prove more specific and sensitive for HCC detection than that of the traditional biomarker, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This may be especially true if it can be measured and identified earlier in the diagnostic process. We sought to develop a testing platform to measure GP73 levels for the purposes of earlier diagnostic screening of at risk patients. We expressed recombinant GP73 protein to use as an immunogen in order to develop several monoclonal anti-GP73 antibodies. Three clones, 1D7, 2B2, and 5B4, were identified with all three having a higher than 1:5,000,000 titer. These clones were then isotyped and validated to bind the immunogen protein. Different combinations of antibody pairs were then tested in order to create a functional sandwich antibody pair. Using this pair on liver disease patient serum samples, we found that GP73 was significantly elevated when compared to healthy control patient serum (P < 0.0001). Average GP73 levels in HCC patients was 284.0 ng/mL, slightly higher than liver disease patients (265.6 ng/mL), and significantly elevated over normal serum levels is (74.86 ng/mL). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) for GP73 to detect liver cancer was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.00; P < 0.0001), and GP73 levels had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 87% for detecting liver cancer. By contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of liver disease detection was 76% and 97%, respectively. We then tested detection of 74 serum samples (n control = 46, n liver disease = 7, n liver cancer = 21) by our ELISA testing methodology and commercial kit simultaneously. The results found that our kit and the commercial kit had a good linear correlation coefficient, r(2) = 0.932. Together these clones and our ELISA pair may prove extremely useful in the detection and monitoring of GP73 in HCC and other at risk patients.""","""['Yuming Zhang', 'Yun Xi', 'Jianmin Fang', 'Shuhong Luo', 'Jarad J Wilson', 'Ruo-Pan Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Immunoassay Immunochem""","""['Development and potential application of a simultaneous multiplex assay of Golgi protein 73 and alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis.', 'Preparation and characterization of anti-GP73 monoclonal antibodies and development of double-antibody sandwich ELISA.', 'A study of diagnostic value of golgi protein GP73 and its genetic assay in primary hepatic carcinoma.', 'Golgi protein 73 versus alpha-fetoprotein as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma: a diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of Golgi protein 73 in primary hepatic carcinoma using ELISA: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Golgi protein 73 and its diagnostic value in liver diseases.', 'Discovery of a Potential Plasma Protein Biomarker Panel for Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Induced by Hepatitis B Virus.']"""

Heat is absorbed, causing thermal necrosis of the target region. It combines the aggressive benefits of radiation treatment (destroying cancer cells) without the harmful side effects (due to its precise localization). MRI is typically used pre-treatment to determine the targeted area, and post-treatment to determine efficacy by detecting necrotic tissue, or tumor recurrence. However, no system exists to quantitatively evaluate the post-treatment effects on the morphology and structure via MRI. To quantify these changes, the pre- and post-treatment MR images must first be spatially aligned. The goal is to quantify (a) laser-induced shape-based changes, and (b) changes in MRI parameters post-treatment. The shape-based changes may be correlated with treatment efficacy, and the quantitative effects of laser treatment over time is currently poorly understood. This work attempts to model changes in gland morphology following laser treatment due to (1) patient alignment, (2) changes due to surrounding organs such as the bladder and rectum, and (3) changes due to the treatment itself. To isolate the treatment-induced shape-based changes, the changes from (1) and (2) are first modeled and removed using a finite element model (FEM). A FEM models the physical properties of tissue. The use of a physical biomechanical model is important since a stated goal of this work is to determine the physical shape-based changes to the prostate from the treatment, and therefore only physical real deformations are to be allowed. A second FEM is then used to isolate the physical, shape-based, treatment-induced changes. We applied and evaluated our model in capturing the laser induced changes to the prostate morphology on eight patients with 3.0 Tesla, T2-weighted MRI, acquired approximately six months following treatment. Our results suggest the laser treatment causes a decrease in prostate volume, which appears to manifest predominantly at the site of ablation. After spatially aligning the images, changes to MRI intensity values are clearly visible at the site of ablation. Our results suggest that our new methodology is able to capture and quantify the degree of laser-induced changes to the prostate. The quantitative measurements reflecting of the deformation changes can be used to track treatment response over time.""","""['Robert Toth', 'Dan Sperling', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Endoscopic laser ablation of the prostate: MR appearances during and after treatment and their relation to clinical outcome.', 'Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Quantitative Evaluation of Treatment Related Changes on Multi-Parametric MRI after Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Thermal Therapy for Localized and Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', '3D Registration of mpMRI for Assessment of Prostate Cancer Focal Therapy.', 'Impact of manual control point selection accuracy on automated surface matching of digital dental models.', 'Theoretical model for laser ablation outcome predictions in brain: calibration and validation on clinical MR thermometry images.']"""

Inflammation is damaging to tissues, but it is unclear how the inflammatory microenvironment protects specialized epithelial cells that function to proliferate and repair the tissue. The objective of this study is to characterize the cell death and cell survival response of the prostatic epithelium in response to inflammation.  Methods:   We assessed induction of cell death (TNF, TRAIL, TWEAK, FasL) and cell survival factors (IGFs, hedgehogs, IL-6, FGFs, and TGFs) in inflamed and control mouse prostates by ELISA. Cell death mechanisms were determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for cleavage of caspases and TUNEL. Survival pathway activation was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and survivin. Autophagy was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for free and membrane associated light chain 3 (LC-3).  Results:   Cleavage of all four caspases was significantly increased during the first 2 days of inflammation, and survival protein expression was substantially increased subsequently, maximizing at 3 days. By 5 days of inflammation, 50% of prostatic epithelial cells expressed survivin. Autophagy was also evident during the recovery phase (3 days). Finally, immunofluorescent staining of human specimens indicates strong activation of survival proteins juxtaposed to inflammation in inflamed prostate specimens.  Conclusions:   The prostate responds to deleterious inflammation with induction of cell survival mechanisms, most notably survivin and autophagy, demonstrating a coordinated induction of survival factors that protects and expands a specialized set of prostatic epithelial cells as part of the repair and recovery process during inflammation.""","""['David W McIlwain', 'Marloes Zoetemelk', 'Jason D Myers', 'Marshé T Edwards', 'Brandy M Snider', 'Travis J Jerde']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-alpha transduction pathway in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma.', 'Apoptosis induction in prostate cancer cells and xenografts by combined treatment with Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and CPT-11.', 'A human prostatic bacterial isolate alters the prostatic microenvironment and accelerates prostate cancer progression.', 'Death receptor-induced cell death in prostate cancer.', 'Tumour necrosis factor superfamily members in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Antitumor Activity and Mechanistic Characterization of APE1/Ref-1 Inhibitors in Bladder Cancer.', 'APE1/Ref-1 redox-specific inhibition decreases survivin protein levels and induces cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Recently theranostic concepts using radiolabeled ligands of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been developed for diagnostics and therapy of patients with advanced mCRPC. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor response, adverse effects, and survival in patients undergoing radioligand therapy with Lu-PSMA-617.  Methods:   Fifty therapies using Lu-PSMA-617 were performed in 28 consecutive patients with mCRPC and exhausted conventional therapeutic options (median age, 73.4 years; range, 45-87 years). Data were retrospectively analyzed with focus on response, safety, and survival. The median overall survival was compared with that of a recent historical patient cohort treated with best supportive care prior to availability of Lu-PSMA-617.  Results:   Any PSA decline occurred in 59% and 75% of patients after 1 and 2 therapies. Moreover, a PSA decline of 50% or greater occurred in 32% and 50%. Therapies were well tolerated. Hematologic and renal parameters changed insignificantly; permanent xerostomia or other safety-related toxicity did not occur.

Although PEGylation of nanoparticles has been successfully demonstrated as a strategy to enhance colloidal stability, its success in improving delivery efficiency has been limited, largely due to reduced cell binding and uptake, leading to poor transfection efficiency. Here we identified an optimized PEGylation scheme for DNA micellar nanoparticles that delivers balanced colloidal stability and transfection activity. Using linear polyethylenimine (lPEI)-g-PEG as a carrier, we characterized the effect of graft length and density of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on nanoparticle assembly, micelle stability, and gene delivery efficiency. Through variation of PEG grafting degree, lPEI with short PEG grafts (molecular weight, MW 500-700 Da) generated micellar nanoparticles with various shapes including spherical, rodlike, and wormlike nanoparticles. DNA micellar nanoparticles prepared with short PEG grafts showed comparable colloidal stability in salt and serum-containing media to those prepared with longer PEG grafts (MW 2 kDa). Corresponding to this trend, nanoparticles prepared with short PEG grafts displayed significantly higher in vitro transfection efficiency compared to those with longer PEG grafts. More importantly, short PEG grafts permitted marked increase in transfection efficiency following ligand conjugation to the PEG terminal in metastatic prostate cancer-bearing mice. This study identifies that lPEI-g-PEG with short PEG grafts (MW 500-700 Da) is the most effective to ensure shape control and deliver high colloidal stability, transfection activity, and ligand effect for DNA nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo following intravenous administration.""","""['John-Michael Williford', 'Maani M Archang', 'Il Minn', 'Yong Ren', 'Mark Wo', 'John Vandermark', 'Paul B Fisher', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Hai-Quan Mao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""ACS Biomater Sci Eng""","""['Subtle changes in surface-tethered groups on PEGylated DNA nanoparticles significantly influence gene transfection and cellular uptake.', 'Synergistic effect of low cytotoxic linear polyethylenimine and multiarm polyethylene glycol: study of physicochemical properties and in vitro gene transfection.', 'Polyethylenimine-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers: influence of copolymer block structure on DNA complexation and biological activities as gene delivery system.', 'String-like micellar nanoparticles formed by complexation of PEG-b-PPA and plasmid DNA and their transfection efficiency.', 'PEGylation as a strategy for improving nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery.', 'Non-spherical Polymeric Nanocarriers for Therapeutics: The Effect of Shape on Biological Systems and Drug Delivery Properties.', 'Design of Nanoparticles in Cancer Therapy Based on Tumor Microenvironment Properties.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Inhalation Therapy for Pulmonary Diseases.', 'Polydopamine-based nanoparticles with excellent biocompatibility for photothermally enhanced gene delivery.', 'Synthesis and Characterization of Diosgenin Encapsulated Poly-ε-Caprolactone-Pluronic Nanoparticles and Its Effect on Brain Cancer Cells.']"""

In our discovery set of ten tumor/normal subject pairs with Gleason scores of 8-10 at diagnosis, coordinated analysis of germline and somatic variants, including single-nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants, revealed biallelic BRCA2 disruptions in a subset of samples. Compared to the other samples, the PCa BRCA2-deficient tumors exhibited a complex and highly specific mutation signature, featuring a 2.88-fold increased somatic mutation rate, depletion of context-specific C>T substitutions, and an enrichment for deletions, especially those longer than 10 bp. We next performed a BRCA2 deficiency-targeted reanalysis of 150 metastatic PCa tumors, and each of the 18 BRCA2-mutated samples recapitulated the BRCA2 deficiency-associated mutation signature, underscoring the potent influence of these lesions on somatic mutagenesis and tumor evolution. Among all 21 individuals with BRCA2-deficient tumors, only about half carried deleterious germline alleles. Importantly, the somatic mutation signature in tumors with one germline and one somatic risk allele was indistinguishable from those with purely somatic mutations. Our observations clearly demonstrate that BRCA2-disrupted tumors represent a unique and clinically relevant molecular subtype of aggressive PCa, highlighting both the promise and utility of this mutation signature as a prognostic and treatment-selection biomarker. Further, any test designed to leverage BRCA2 status as a biomarker for PCa must consider both germline and somatic mutations and all types of deleterious mutations.""","""['Brennan Decker', 'Danielle M Karyadi', 'Brian W Davis', 'Eric Karlins', 'Lori S Tillmans', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Elaine A Ostrander']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['A first Japanese case of neuroendocrine prostate cancer accompanied by lung and brain metastasis with somatic and germline BRCA2 mutation.', 'Patient-derived xenografts reveal that intraductal carcinoma of the prostate is a prominent pathology in BRCA2 mutation carriers with prostate cancer and correlates with poor prognosis.', 'High burden of copy number alterations and c-MYC amplification in prostate cancer from BRCA2 germline mutation carriers.', 'The influence of BRCA2 mutation on localized prostate cancer.', 'Overall Survival and Clinical Characteristics of BRCA-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Phosphorylation status of MUS81 is a modifier of Olaparib sensitivity in BRCA2-deficient cells.', 'The tumor mutational landscape of BRCA2-deficient primary and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Profiling of Prostate Cancer: An Updated Review.', 'A subset of lung cancer cases shows robust signs of homologous recombination deficiency associated genomic mutational signatures.', 'A unified haplotype-based method for accurate and comprehensive variant calling.']"""

HVS was distinguished for its remarkable potency against wild-type c-Met and its oncogenic variant in cell-free assays and confirmed by in silico docking studies. Furthermore, HVS substantially impaired the c-Met-mediated growth across a broad spectrum of breast cancer cells, while similar treatment doses had no effect on the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell growth. In addition, HVS caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced, cell scattering in addition to HGF-mediated migration, invasion, and 3-dimensional (3D) proliferation of tumor cell spheroids. HVS treatment effects were mediated via inhibition of ligand-mediated c-Met activation and its downstream mitogenic signaling and blocking molecular mediators involved in cellular motility across different cellular contexts. An interesting feature of HVS is its good selectivity for c-Met and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) when profiled against a panel of kinases. Docking studies revealed interactions likely to impart high dual affinity for both ABL1 and c-Met kinases. HVS markedly reduced tumor growth, showed excellent pharmacodynamics, and suppressed cell proliferation and microvessel density in an orthotopic model of triple negative breast cancer. Collectively, the present findings suggested that the oleocanthal-based HVS is a promising c-Met inhibitor lead entity with excellent therapeutic potential to control malignancies with aberrant c-Met activity.""","""['Mohamed M Mohyeldin', 'Mohamed R Akl', 'Hassan Y Ebrahim', 'Ana Maria Dragoi', 'Samantha Dykes', 'James A Cardelli', 'Khalid A El Sayed']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Olive phenolics as c-Met inhibitors: (-)-Oleocanthal attenuates cell proliferation, invasiveness, and tumor growth in breast cancer models.', 'Novel c-Met inhibitory olive secoiridoid semisynthetic analogs for the control of invasive breast cancer.', 'The indole alkaloid meleagrin, from the olive tree endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, as a novel lead for the control of c-Met-dependent breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion.', 'Targeting the MET gene for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'The scatter factor signaling pathways as therapeutic associated target in cancer treatment.', 'Triple-negative breast cancer suppressive activities, antioxidants and pharmacophore model of new acylated rhamnopyranoses from Premna odorata.', 'Comparative Gene Signature of (-)-Oleocanthal Formulation Treatments in Heterogeneous Triple Negative Breast Tumor Models: Oncological Therapeutic Target Insights.', 'Potential Uses of Olive Oil Secoiridoids for the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer: A Narrative Review of Preclinical Studies.', 'Targeting Multiple Signaling Pathways in Cancer: The Rutin Therapeutic Approach.', '(-)-Oleocanthal as a Dual c-MET-COX2 Inhibitor for the Control of Lung Cancer.']"""

For a group of 11 patients (35Gy-in-five-fractions VMAT prostate SBRT) a set of 4 plans were generated, namely two VMAT plans, with D2%⩽37.5Gy (Hom) and with D2%⩽40.2Gy (Het), were created for each of two CT scans taken before (NoSpc) and after (Spc) transperineal spacer insertion. Consequently the methodology for parameter invariant TCP (tumor control probability) plan ranking was applied for comparison of the plans in terms of tumor control. NTCPs (normal tissue complication probabilities) were calculated for rectum and bladder using Lyman's model. For all 11 patients the TCP plan ranking has shown that the Het plans would perform considerably better in TCP terms than the Hom ones. The plans without rectal spacer were ranked worse compared to those with rectal spacer except for one set of Hom plans. The calculated NTCPs for rectum produced by the Het plans were quite similar to the NTCPs of the Hom ones. The rectal NTCPs of the Hom Spc plans were always lower than the NTCPs of the Hom NoSpc plans. The NTCP values for bladder were extremely low in all cases. The use of rectal spacer leads in general to lower risk of rectal complications, as expected, and even to better tumor control.

We describe patterns of sADT use and investigate clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of insured men who received sADT versus surveillance in managed care settings.  Methods:   Using comprehensive electronic health records and cancer registry data from three integrated health plans, we identified all men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer between 1995 and 2009 who received either prostatectomy (n = 16,445) or radiotherapy (n = 19,531) as their primary therapy.

Considering Alternative Beam Angles and Relative Biological Effectiveness Variations When Comparing Against Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy""","""Purpose:   For prostate treatments, robust evidence regarding the superiority of either intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton therapy is currently lacking. In this study we investigated the circumstances under which proton therapy should be expected to outperform IMRT, particularly the proton beam orientations and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) assumptions.  Methods and materials:   For 8 patients, 4 treatment planning strategies were considered: (A) IMRT; (B) passively scattered standard bilateral (SB) proton beams; (C) passively scattered anterior oblique (AO) proton beams, and (D) AO intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). For modalities (B)-(D) the dose and linear energy transfer (LET) distributions were simulated using the TOPAS Monte Carlo platform and RBE was calculated according to 3 different models.  Results:   Assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1, our implementation of IMRT outperformed SB proton therapy across most normal tissue metrics. For the scattered AO proton plans, application of the variable RBE models resulted in substantial hotspots in rectal RBE weighted dose. For AO IMPT, it was typically not possible to find a plan that simultaneously met the tumor and rectal constraints for both fixed and variable RBE models.  Conclusion:   If either a fixed RBE of 1.1 or a variable RBE model could be validated in vivo, then it would always be possible to use AO IMPT to dose-boost the prostate and improve normal tissue sparing relative to IMRT. For a cohort without rectum spacer gels, this study (1) underlines the importance of resolving the question of proton RBE within the framework of an IMRT versus proton debate for the prostate and (2) highlights that without further LET/RBE model validation, great care must be taken if AO proton fields are to be considered for prostate treatments.""","""['Tracy Underwood', 'Drosoula Giantsoudi', 'Maryam Moteabbed', 'Anthony Zietman', 'Jason Efstathiou', 'Harald Paganetti', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Hydrogel rectum-prostate spacers mitigate the uncertainties in proton relative biological effectiveness associated with anterior-oblique beams.', 'Biological dose and complication probabilities for the rectum and bladder based on linear energy transfer distributions in spot scanning proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) - The future of IMRT for head and neck cancer.', 'Proton linear energy transfer and variable relative biological effectiveness for adolescent patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Dosimetric Effects of the Supine and Prone Positions in Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Consensus Statement on Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Critical Review of LET-Based Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy Plan Evaluation and Optimization for Head and Neck Cancer Management.']"""

Methods and materials:   In this trial, 92 patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either proton therapy (arm A) or carbon ion therapy (arm B) and treated with a total dose of 66 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) administered in 20 fractions (single dose of 3.3 Gy[RBE]). Patients were stratified by the use of antihormone therapy. Primary endpoint was the combined assessment of safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints were specific toxicities, prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL).  Results:   Ninety-one patients completed therapy and have had a median follow-up of 22.3 months. Among acute genitourinary toxicities, grade 1 cystitis rates were 34.1% (39.1% in A; 28.9% in B) and 17.6% grade 2 (21.7% in A; 13.3% in B). Seven patients (8%) required urinary catheterization during treatment due to urinary retention, 5 of whom were in arm A. Regarding acute gastrointestinal toxicities, 2 patients treated with protons developed grade 3 rectal fistulas. Grade 1 radiation proctitis occurred in 12.1% (13.0% in A; 11.1% in B) and grade 2 in 5.5% (8.7% in A; 2.2% in B). No statistically significant differences in toxicity profiles between arms were found. Reduced QoL was evident mainly in fatigue, pain, and urinary symptoms during therapy and 6 weeks thereafter. All European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and -PR25 scores improved during follow-up.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated irradiation using either carbon ions or protons results in comparable acute toxicities and QoL parameters. We found that hypofractionated particle irradiation is feasible and may be safe.

Methods and materials:   The medical records of 1327 men were reviewed. Each man was enrolled on an outcomes tracking study. Dual enrollment on a prospective clinical trial was allowed. Each patient was treated for localized prostate cancer with PT at our institution between 2006 and 2010. Ninety-eight percent of patients received 78 Gy (radiobiological equivalent [RBE]) or higher; 18% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The 5-year freedom from biochemical progression (FFBP), distant metastasis-free survival, and cause-specific survival rates are reported for each risk group. Data on patient-reported quality of life and high-grade toxicities were prospectively collected and reported. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify clinical predictors of biochemical failure and urologic toxicity.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 5.5 years. The 5-year FFBP rates were 99%, 94%, and 74% in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively. The actuarial 5-year rates of late grade 3+ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between grade 3+ GU toxicity and pretreatment prostate reductive procedures (P<.0001), prostate volume (P=.0085), pretreatment α-blockers (P=.0067), diabetes (P=.0195), and dose-volume histogram parameters (P=.0208). The median International Prostate Symptom Scores pretreatment scores and scores at 5 years after treatment were 7 and 7, respectively. The mean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores significantly declined for sexual summary for patients not receiving ADT (from 67 to 53) between baseline and 5 years.  Conclusions:   Image guided PT provided excellent biochemical control rates for patients with localized prostate cancer. The actuarial rates of high-grade toxicity were low after PT. From pretreatment to 5 years of follow-up, a significant decline was found only in mean EPIC sexual summary scores.

Methods and materials:   A total of 103 phantoms were irradiated by proton therapy centers participating in clinical trials. The anthropomorphic phantoms simulated heterogeneous anatomy of a head, liver, lung, prostate, and spine. Treatment plans included those for scattered, uniform scanning, and pencil beam scanning beam delivery modalities using 5 different treatment planning systems. For every phantom irradiation, point doses and planar doses were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) and film, respectively. Differences between measured and planned doses were studied as a function of phantom, beam delivery modality, motion, repeat attempt, treatment planning system, and date of irradiation.  Results:   The phantom pass rate (overall, 79%) was high for simple phantoms and lower for phantoms that introduced higher levels of difficulty, such as motion, multiple targets, or increased heterogeneity. All treatment planning systems overestimated dose to the target, compared to TLD measurements. Errors in range calculation resulted in several failed phantoms. There was no correlation between treatment planning system and pass rate. The pass rates for each individual phantom are not improving over time, but when individual institutions received feedback about failed phantom irradiations, pass rates did improve.  Conclusions:   The proton phantom pass rates are not as high as desired and emphasize potential deficiencies in proton therapy planning and/or delivery.

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening versus zero screening, starting at age 50-54 yr, on prostate cancer mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a population-based cohort study comparing 3479 men aged 50 yr through 54 yr randomized to PSA-screening in the Göteborg population-based prostate cancer screening trial, initiated in 1995, versus 4060 unscreened men aged 51-55 yr providing cryopreserved blood in the population-based Malmö Preventive Project in the pre-PSA era, during 1982-1985.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cumulative incidence and incidence rate ratios of prostate cancer diagnosis, metastasis, and prostate cancer death.  Results and limitations:   At 17 yr, regular PSA-screening in Göteborg of men in their early 50s carried a more than two-fold higher risk of prostate cancer diagnosis compared with the unscreened men in Malmö (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.18, 3.02), but resulted in a substantial decrease in the risk of metastases (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22, 0.79) and prostate cancer death (IRR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11, 0.67). There were 57 fewer prostate cancer deaths per 10000 men (95% CI 22, 92) in the screened group. At 17 yr, the number needed to invite to PSA-screening and the number needed to diagnose to prevent one prostate cancer death was 176 and 16, respectively. The study is limited by lack of treatment information and the comparison of the two different birth cohorts.  Conclusions:   PSA screening for prostate cancer can decrease prostate cancer mortality among men aged 50-54 yr, with the number needed to invite and number needed to detect to prevent one prostate cancer death comparable to those previously reported from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer for men aged 55-69 yr, at a similar follow-up.

Baseline patient characteristics were collected, including Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Discharge criteria were identical for all patients and included: return of bowel function, pain controlled with oral medications, and ambulation without assistance.

Baseline patient and tumor characteristics, including age, race, body-mass index (BMI), pathologic stage, and Gleason score, were not significantly different. Mean operative time was shorter for patients with LOS > 1 day (155 vs. 173 min, p < 0.01) on univariate analysis. Patients with LOS > 1 day were more likely to have had a complication: 8/49 (17 %) vs. 14/225 (6 %), p < 0.01. However, multivariate logistic regression found baseline CCI > 2 as the only independent predictor of LOS > 1 day (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), controlling for age, race, BMI, Gleason score, tumor stage, blood loss, operative time, and occurrence of complication. In our experience, baseline patient comorbidity, quantified by CCI, was the only independent predictor of hospital LOS greater than 1 day following RARP.

As such, inhibition of CYP17A1 is a target for inhibiting the growth of hormone-dependent cancers including prostate and breast cancer. Abiraterone, is a first in class potent and selective CYP17A1 inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Given that, androgens are the precursors for estrogen production, it has been proposed that abiraterone could be an effective form of treatment for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, though its utility in this context has yet to be established. Abiraterone has a core steroid-like chemical structure, and so we hypothesized that it may bind to nuclear steroid receptors including ER and have estrogenic activity. We tested this hypothesis by investigating abiraterone's ability to directly modulate ER signaling in breast cancer cell line models. We show that abiraterone directly activates ER, induces ER-target gene expression, and elicits estrogen-response-element reporter activity in the ER-positive cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. Abiraterone also induced cell proliferation by ~2.5-fold over vehicle in both MCF-7 and T47D cells. Importantly, abiraterone-induced cell proliferation and ER-activity was blocked by the selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant, confirming that abiraterone directly acts at the ER. These data suggest that abiraterone should be combined with other ER antagonists when used for the clinical management of ER-positive breast cancer.""","""['Cameron P Capper', 'José M Larios', 'Matthew J Sikora', 'Michael D Johnson', 'James M Rae']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Abiraterone shows alternate activity in models of endocrine resistant and sensitive disease.', 'Novel estrogenic action of the pesticide residue beta-hexachlorocyclohexane in human breast cancer cells.', 'Models of estrogen receptor regulation by estrogens and antiestrogens in breast cancer cell lines.', 'The use of selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor down-regulators in breast cancer.', 'The therapeutic role of fulvestrant in the management of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.', 'Precocious Puberty in a Boy With Bilateral Leydig Cell Tumors due to a Somatic Gain-of-Function LHCGR Variant.', 'Gene Expression Signature Predictive of Neuroendocrine Transformation in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Abiraterone shows alternate activity in models of endocrine resistant and sensitive disease.', 'Family Matters: Collaboration and Conflict Among the Steroid Receptors Raises a Need for Group Therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 335 men with high-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen ≥20ng/ml or biopsy Gleason score 8 to 10 or≥cT2c) received radical treatment between 2007 and 2014. Men were identified from comprehensive clinical databases hosted at a tertiary cancer center in the UK.

The secondary purpose was to determine whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) modified responses to exercise training.  Methods:   Secondary analysis was undertaken on data from a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial in which 15 clinicians were randomly assigned to refer eligible patients to an exercise training intervention (n = 8) or to provide usual care (n = 7). Data from 119 patients (intervention n = 53, control n = 66) were available for this analysis. Outcome measures included fitness and physical function, anthropometrics, resting heart rate, and blood pressure.  Results:   Compared to the control condition, men in the intervention significantly improved their 6-min walk distance (M diff = 49.98 m, p adj = 0.001), leg strength (M diff = 21.82 kg, p adj = 0.001), chest strength (M diff = 6.91 kg, p adj = 0.001), 30-s sit-to-stand result (M diff = 3.38 reps, p adj = 0.001), and reach distance (M diff = 4.8 cm, p adj = 0.024). A significant difference (unadjusted for multiplicity) in favour of men in the intervention was also found for resting heart rate (M diff = -3.76 beats/min, p = 0.034). ADT did not modify responses to exercise training.  Conclusions:   Men with prostate cancer who act upon clinician referrals to community-based exercise training programs can improve their strength, physical functioning, and, potentially, cardiovascular health, irrespective of whether or not they are treated with ADT.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Clinicians should inform men with prostate cancer about the benefits of exercise and refer them to appropriately qualified exercise practitioners and suitable community-based programs.

The research goal of many laboratories is to elucidate the signaling pathways and effectors that are responsible for cancer cell invasion, but many of these experiments rely on in vitro methods that do not specifically simulate individual steps of the metastatic cascade. Cancer cell extravasation is arguably the most important example of invasion in the metastatic cascade, whereby a single cancer cell undergoes transendothelial migration, forming invasive processes known as invadopodia to mediate translocation of the tumor cell from the vessel lumen into tissue in vivo. We have developed a rapid, reproducible and economical technique to evaluate cancer cell invasiveness by quantifying in vivo rates of cancer cell extravasation in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos. This technique enables the investigator to perform well-powered loss-of-function studies of cancer cell extravasation within 24 h, and it can be used to identify and validate drugs with potential antimetastatic effects that specifically target cancer cell extravasation. A key advantage of this technique over similar assays is that intravascular cancer cells within the capillary bed of the CAM are clearly distinct from extravasated cells, which makes cancer cell extravasation easy to detect. An intermediate level of experience in injections of the chorioallantoic membrane of avian embryos and cell culture techniques is required to carry out the protocol.""","""['Yohan Kim', 'Karla C Williams', 'Carson T Gavin', 'Emily Jardine', 'Ann F Chambers', 'Hon S Leong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nat Protoc""","""['Quantitative Analysis of Human Cancer Cell Extravasation Using Intravital Imaging.', 'The Chicken Egg Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Model as an In Vivo Method for the Investigation of the Invasion and Metastasis Cascade of Malignant Tumor Cells.', 'Evaluation of Tumor Cell Invasiveness In Vivo: The Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay.', 'Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model systems to study and visualize human tumor cell metastasis.', 'Preclinical assessment of anti-cancer therapeutic strategies using in vivo videomicroscopy.', 'Endothelium and Subendothelial Matrix Mechanics Modulate Cancer Cell Transendothelial Migration.', 'Development of an in\xa0vivo system to model breast cancer metastatic organotropism and evaluate treatment response using the chick embryo.', 'In Vitro Tumor Models on Chip and Integrated Microphysiological Analysis Platform (MAP) for Life Sciences and High-Throughput Drug Screening.', 'Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay for the evaluation of the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of platinum-based drugs in association with the impact on the amino acid metabolism.', 'UBE2O promotes lipid metabolic reprogramming and liver cancer progression by mediating HADHA ubiquitination.']"""

This applies particularly to studies of tumor metabolism. The challenge is, however, the complex mixture of various tissue types within each sample, such as benign epithelium, stroma and cancer tissue, which can introduce systematic biases when cancers are compared to normal samples. In this study we apply a simple strategy to remove such biases using sample selections where the average content of stroma tissue is balanced between the sample groups. The strategy is applied to a prostate cancer patient cohort where data from MR spectroscopy and gene expression have been collected from and integrated on the exact same tissue samples. We reveal in vivo changes in cancer-relevant metabolic pathways which are otherwise hidden in the data due to tissue confounding. In particular, lowered levels of putrescine are connected to increased expression of SRM, reduced levels of citrate are attributed to upregulation of genes promoting fatty acid synthesis, and increased succinate levels coincide with reduced expression of SUCLA2 and SDHD. In addition, the strategy also highlights important metabolic differences between the stroma, epithelium and prostate cancer. These results show that important in vivo metabolic features of cancer can be revealed from patient data only if the heterogeneous tissue composition is properly accounted for in the analysis.""","""['May-Britt Tessem', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'Anders Angelsen', 'Tone F Bathen', 'Finn Drabløs', 'Morten Beck Rye']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cholesterol synthesis pathway genes in prostate cancer are transcriptionally downregulated when tissue confounding is minimized.', 'Integrative metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of prostate cancer tissue containing reactive stroma.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Citrate transport and metabolism in mammalian cells: prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer.', 'The clinical relevance of the metabolism of prostate cancer; zinc and tumor suppression: connecting the dots.', 'Succinate at the Crossroad of Metabolism and Angiogenesis: Roles of SDH, HIF1α and SUCNR1.', 'FunHoP analysis reveals upregulation of mitochondrial genes in prostate cancer.', 'The genes controlling normal function of citrate and spermine secretion are lost in aggressive prostate cancer and prostate model systems.', 'Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cells Reprogram Their Metabolic Signature upon GLUT1 Upregulation by Manganese Superoxide Dismutase.', 'Metabolic Phenotyping in Prostate Cancer Using Multi-Omics Approaches.']"""

We found that the co-expressed genes observed in single cells and bulk tumors have little overlap and show distinct characteristics. The co-expressed genes identified in bulk tumors tend to have similar biological functions, and are enriched for intrachromosomal interactions with synchronized promoter activity. In contrast, single-cell co-expressed genes are enriched for known protein-protein interactions, and are regulated through interchromosomal interactions. Moreover, gene members of some protein complexes are co-expressed only at the bulk level, while those of other complexes are co-expressed at both single-cell and bulk levels. Finally, we identified a set of co-expressed genes that can predict the survival of glioblastoma patients.

Enrolled patients underwent cystography 7 days after retropubic RP; in case of UL, the catheter was left in situ and cystography repeated at 7 days intervals until demonstrating absence of UL. Leakage was classified as grade I = extraperitoneal leak <6 cm, grade II = extraperitoneal leak >6 cm, grade III = leak freely extending in the small pelvis. Voiding was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months after RP using the 24-hour pad test and uroflowmetry; in cases of maximum flow rate <10 mL/s, urethrocystoscopy was carried out to determine presence and location of an AS. The first postoperative cystogram showed UL in 52.6% of patients (grade I in 48.1%, grade II in 21.5%, and grade III in 30.4% of the cases). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with UL had significantly greater prostate volume (64.5 vs 34.8 cc, P < 0.001), loss of serum hemoglobin (4.77 vs 4.19 g/dL, P < 0.001), lower postoperative serum total proteins (4.85 vs 5.4 g/dL, P < 0.001), and higher rate of AS (20.6% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001) than those without UL. Continence rate at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively was 34.2%, 76%, and 90%, respectively, in patients with UL compared with 77.5%, 80.3%, and 93% in patients without UL; such difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) only at 3 months follow-up. ROC curve analysis showed that prostate volume and postoperative serum total proteins had the best AUC (0.821 and 0.822, respectively) and when combined, their positive and negative predictive values for UL were 90% and 93%, respectively. In conclusion, half of the patients undergoing open retropubic RP may present, 7 days postoperatively, some degree of cystographically detected UL; prostate volume, loss of serum hemoglobin, and postoperative serum total proteins could be used to predict it.

There are unresolved tensions and disagreements amongst experts, and clinical guidelines conflict. This both reflects and generates significant uncertainty about the appropriateness of screening. Little is known about general practitioners' (GPs') perspectives and experiences in relation to PSA testing of asymptomatic men. In this paper we asked the following questions: (1) What are the primary sources of uncertainty as described by GPs in the context of PSA testing? (2) How do GPs experience and respond to different sources of uncertainty?  Methods:   This was a qualitative study that explored general practitioners' current approaches to, and reasoning about, PSA testing of asymptomatic men. We draw on accounts generated from interviews with 69 general practitioners located in Australia (n = 40) and the United Kingdom (n = 29). The interviews were conducted in 2013-2014. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Uncertainty in PSA testing was identified as a core issue.  Findings:   Australian GPs reported experiencing substantially more uncertainty than UK GPs. This seemed partly explainable by notable differences in conditions of practice between the two countries. Using Han et al's taxonomy of uncertainty as an initial framework, we first outline the different sources of uncertainty GPs (mostly Australian) described encountering in relation to prostate cancer screening and what the uncertainty was about. We then suggest an extension to Han et al's taxonomy based on our analysis of data relating to the varied ways that GPs manage uncertainties in the context of PSA testing. We outline three broad strategies: (1) taking charge of uncertainty; (2) engaging others in managing uncertainty; and (3) transferring the responsibility for reducing or managing some uncertainties to other parties.  Conclusion:   Our analysis suggests some GPs experienced uncertainties associated with ambiguous guidance and the complexities of their situation as professionals with responsibilities to patients as considerably burdensome. This raises important questions about responsibility for uncertainty. In Australia in particular they feel insufficiently supported by the health care system to practice in ways that are recognisably consistent with 'evidence based' professional standards and appropriate for patients. More work is needed to clarify under what circumstances and how uncertainty should be communicated. Closer attention to different types and aspects of the uncertainty construct could be useful.""","""['Kristen Pickles', 'Stacy M Carter', 'Lucie Rychetnik', 'Kirsten McCaffery', 'Vikki A Entwistle']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[""Primary goals, information-giving and men's understanding: a qualitative study of Australian and UK doctors' varied communication about PSA screening."", ""Doctors' perspectives on PSA testing illuminate established differences in prostate cancer screening rates between Australia and the UK: a qualitative study."", ""Doctors' approaches to PSA testing and overdiagnosis in primary healthcare: a qualitative study."", 'Prostate specific antigen testing policy worldwide varies greatly and seems not to be in accordance with guidelines: a systematic review.', ""Gut feelings as a third track in general practitioners' diagnostic reasoning."", 'American Indian/Alaska Native men are less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal exams from primary care providers than White men: a secondary analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2018.', 'Strategies used in managing conversations about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing among family physicians (FPs): a qualitative study.', 'Prostate cancer screening: Continued controversies and novel biomarker advancements.', ""General practitioners' reflections on using PSA for diagnosis of prostate cancer.

To make progress, the following steps are necessary: (i) identification of intermediate biomarkers predictive of fatal/lethal disease; (ii) development of a rational approach to identification of candidate agents, including high-throughput screening and generation of information on mechanism and biology of candidate agents and potential molecular targets; and (iii) systematic evaluation of the predictive value of preclinical models, phase II trials, and intermediate biomarkers for the outcome of phase III trials.

However, it is undetermined how tertiary GP5 is handled in the new Gleason grade grouping starting in 2016, and its prognostic value in patients undergoing salvage treatment for postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR) remains unclear.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 116 patients with pT2-3N0M0 prostate cancer (PC) who received salvage treatment for BCR after radical prostatectomy between 2003 and 2014. The primary endpoint was failure of salvage treatment, defined as a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value ≥0.2 ng/ml after PSA nadir following salvage treatment. Associations of various clinicopathological factors, including GP5, with failure-free survival were assessed. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis.  Results:   Patients received salvage treatment with either radiotherapy (n = 48), androgen-deprivation therapy (n = 61), or both (n = 7) for BCR. Twenty-three patients (19.8 %) experienced failure of salvage treatment, with a median follow-up period of 79 months. Univariate analysis associated GP5, Gleason score-based parameters, lymphovascular invasion, and PSA doubling time <6 months with poorer failure-free survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified the area under the curve for GP5 (0.654) as the largest among those parameters (P = 0.0060). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that GP5 was the only independent predictor of poor outcome.  Conclusions:   The presence of GP5 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with pT2-3N0M0 PC undergoing salvage treatment for BCR after radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   During structured interviews, we explored how 70 participants evaluated and completed four discrete choice tasks aloud.

Recent understanding of the mechanisms underlying castration resistance in prostate cancer led to the development of new agents targeting the androgen receptor pathway; however, their effectiveness is limited. Hence, there is a need for experimental systems that are able to better reproduce the biological diversity of prostate cancer in preclinical settings. In this study, we established a unique patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify biomarkers for treatment efficacy and resistance and better understand prostate cancer biology.  Methods:   A prostate cancer tissue sample from a Japanese patient was transplanted subcutaneously into male, severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice and this PDX mouse model was named KUCaP3. Sequential tumor volume changes were observed before and after castration. Androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and other molecular markers were examined immunohistochemically. Sequence analysis of AR was also performed to detect mutations. Proteomic analysis of cyst fluid and sera samples of KUCaP3 mice were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS).  Results:   KUCaP3 cell line, derived from human tissue, was successfully and serially passaged in vivo with approximately 60% take rate. KUCaP3 exhibited cyst formation, showed androgen-dependent growth initially, and developed castration-resistant growth several months after castration of the mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that KUCaP3 was positive for AR, PSA, CK18, and α-methyl acyl-coenzyme A racemase, but negative for CK5/6 and ERG. The AR gene in KUCaP3 cells contained a substitution from CAT (histidine) to TAT (tyrosine) at the nucleotide positions corresponding to codon 875 (H875Y) in the ligand-binding domain. Chemiluminescent immunoassay revealed higher levels of PSA in cystic fluid and the serum of KUCaP3-bearing mice. MS analysis detected 23 proteins of human origin in cystic fluids of KUCaP3.  Conclusions:   We developed KUCaP3, an androgen-dependent PDX model with cyst formation. Several proteins including PSA were detected in the cystic fluid and sera of tumor-bearing mice. This original PDX model has the potential to be used as a clinically relevant model to evaluate molecular markers for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Prostate cancer is androgen dependent in the beginning, but as time progresses, it becomes refractory to androgen deprivation treatment. At this stage, docetaxel has been used as standard treatment for years. Cabazitaxel has become the first chemotherapeutic agent which has been shown to increase survival for patients with metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) that progresses after docetaxel. Phase 3 TROPIC study demonstrated that cabazitaxel prolongs survival.  Patients and methods:   In this study, we evaluated a total of 103 patients who took cabazitaxel chemotherapy for mCRPC diagnosis in 21 centers of Turkey, retrospectively. This study included patients who progressed despite docetaxel treatments, had ECOG performance score between 0-2, and used cabazitaxel treatment. Patients received cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 at every 3 weeks, and prednisolone 5 mg twice a day.  Results:   Median number of cabazitaxel cures was 5.03 (range: 1-17). Cabazitaxel response evaluation detected that 34% of the patients had a partial response, 22.3% had stable disease and 32% had a progressive disease. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were neutropenia (28.2%), neutropenic fever (14.5%), anemia (6.7%), and thrombocytopenia (3.8%). In our study, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months and overall survival (OS) was 10.6 months.  Conclusions:   This study reflects toxicity profile of Turkish patients as a Caucasian race.

Prostate, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinomas exhibit consistent marked zinc decrease in situ in the malignant cells, and other cancers (such as kidney, lung, and thyroid) also exhibit decreased tissue zinc levels. However, zinc levels are increased in breast cancer tissue compared to breast normal tissue, and the contemporary dominant view is that zinc is increased in invasive ductal carcinoma. This has important implications regarding the role and effects of zinc in breast malignancy compared to other cancers, which caused us to initiate this study to either confirm or challenge the contemporary view of an increased zinc level in the invasive ductal malignant cells.  Methods:   We employed dithizone staining of breast tissue sections and tissue cores to determine the relative in situ cellular zinc levels specifically in the invasive ductal malignant cells as compared to normal ductal epithelium. This approach had not been employed in any of the reported breast studies.  Results:   The results revealed that the zinc levels are consistently and markedly decreased in the ductal malignant cells as compared with higher prominent zinc levels in the normal ductal epithelium. Decreased zinc is evident in Grade 1 well-differentiated malignancy and in Grade 2 and Grade 3 carcinomas. Among the twenty-five cancer cases in this study, none exhibited increased zinc in the invasive ductal carcinoma compared to the zinc level in the normal ductal epithelium.  Conclusions:   The decreased zinc levels in breast invasive ductal carcinoma is consistent with prostate, pancreatic, and liver carcinomas in which the decrease in zinc is a required event in the development of malignancy to prevent cytotoxicity that would result from the higher zinc levels in the normal cells. This new understanding requires a redirection in elucidating the mechanisms and factors regarding the regulation of zinc in breast cancer, its potential translational applications as possible biomarkers, and for treatment of breast invasive ductal carcinoma.""","""['Leslie C Costello', 'Jing Zou', 'Renty B Franklin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Metallothionein expression and zinc levels in invasive ductal breast carcinoma.', 'LKB1 protein expression in human breast cancer.', 'Differential expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) in a spectrum of normal to malignant breast tissues: implications for in situ and invasive carcinoma.', 'Decreased zinc in the development and progression of malignancy: an important common relationship and potential for prevention and treatment of carcinomas.', 'Cellular mechanisms of zinc dysregulation: a perspective on zinc homeostasis as an etiological factor in the development and progression of breast cancer.', 'Induced Zinc Loss Produces Heterogenous Biological Responses in Melanoma Cells.', 'p53 and Zinc: A Malleable Relationship.', 'Acute Increases in Intracellular Zinc Lead to an Increased Lysosomal and Mitochondrial Autophagy and Subsequent Cell Demise in Malignant Melanoma.', 'Micronutrients and Breast Cancer Progression: A Systematic Review.', 'Zinc distribution within breast cancer tissue of different intrinsic subtypes.']"""

Of the known etiologies, internal malignancies, either known or occult, are well described. Even though malignancies are known to present with internal jugular vein thrombosis, it rarely occurs due to prostate carcinoma. Many cases of jugular vein and superior vena cava thrombosis secondary to malignancies are due to metastatic compression of veins. Recurrent and unusual vascular thrombosis due to hypercoagulability associated with malignancies is also known as Trousseau's syndrome. Here we report a rare case of a patient with internal jugular vein thrombosis as a presenting feature of metastatic prostate carcinoma, which is a case of Trousseau's syndrome.  Case presentation:   A 75-year-old Sri Lankan man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and past history of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage presented with a short history of painless swelling in his left supraclavicular fossa. An examination revealed the swelling was due to a thickened left external jugular vein. A duplex ultrasound scan revealed left-sided internal jugular, external jugular, and brachiocephalic venous thrombosis. Surveillance into underlying malignancies showed an irregular, hard prostate gland suspicious of prostate carcinoma, which was proven with histology, and biochemically. A computed tomography scan found extensive vertebral, pelvic bone, intra-abdominal lymph node metastasis, and a single right-sided lower lung metastatic lesion, with no direct involvement of the jugular vein.  Conclusions:   Spontaneous thrombosis of the internal jugular vein due to Trousseau's syndrome is rare and unusual. Clinicians should promptly investigate for malignancies as it can be the first presentation of underlying occult malignancies.

Problems can be circumvented by using fields at oblique angles. To evaluate the influence of setup and range uncertainties accompanying oblique field angles, we calculated rectal dose changes with oblique orthogonal field angles, using a device with fixed fields at 0° and 90° and a rotating patient couch.  Material and methods:   Dose distributions were calculated at the standard angles of 0° and 90°, and then at 30° and 60°. Setup uncertainty was simulated with changes from -2 mm to +2 mm for fields in the anterior-posterior, left-right, and cranial-caudal directions, and dose changes from range uncertainty were calculated with a 1 mm water-equivalent path length added to the target isocenter in each angle. The dose distributions regarding the passive irradiation method were calculated using the K2 dose algorithm.  Results:   The rectal volumes with 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° field angles at 95% of the prescription dose were 3.4±0.9 cm3, 2.8±1.1 cm3, 2.2±0.8 cm3, and 3.8±1.1 cm3, respectively. As compared with 90° fields, 30° and 60° fields had significant advantages regarding setup uncertainty and significant disadvantages regarding range uncertainty, but were not significantly different from the 90° field setup and range uncertainties.

To explain this clinical observation, we studied the expression and prognostic impact of mTOR-S2448 phosphorylation in localized prostate carcinomas. mTOR-S2448 phosphorylation is indicative for an activated mTOR pathway in prostate cancer.

The pivotal position of medical physicists in treatment personalization probably represents the main challenge of current and next years and needs a gradual change of vision and training, without losing the traditional and fundamental role of physicists to guarantee a high quality of the treatment. The current focus issue is intended to cover traditional and new fields of investigation in prostate cancer radiation therapy with the aim to provide up-to-date reference material to medical physicists daily working to cure prostate cancer patients. The papers presented in this focus issue touch upon present and upcoming challenges that need to be met in order to further advance prostate cancer radiation therapy.

In partnership with multivariate analysis and machine learning techniques, it has become widely accepted as a method that can distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue with both high sensitivity and high specificity. While spectral histopathology (SHP) is highly promising for improved clinical diagnosis, several practical barriers currently exist, which need to be addressed before successful implementation in the clinic. Sample throughput and speed of acquisition are key barriers and have been driven by the high volume of samples awaiting histopathological examination. FTIR chemical imaging utilising FPA technology is currently state-of-the-art for infrared chemical imaging, and recent advances in its technology have dramatically reduced acquisition times. Despite this, infrared microscopy measurements on a tissue microarray (TMA), often encompassing several million spectra, takes several hours to acquire. The problem lies with the vast quantities of data that FTIR collects; each pixel in a chemical image is derived from a full infrared spectrum, itself composed of thousands of individual data points. Furthermore, data management is quickly becoming a barrier to clinical translation and poses the question of how to store these incessantly growing data sets. Recently, doubts have been raised as to whether the full spectral range is actually required for accurate disease diagnosis using SHP. These studies suggest that once spectral biomarkers have been predetermined it may be possible to diagnose disease based on a limited number of discrete spectral features. In this current study, we explore the possibility of utilising discrete frequency chemical imaging for acquiring high-throughput, high-resolution chemical images. Utilising a quantum cascade laser imaging microscope with discrete frequency collection at key diagnostic wavelengths, we demonstrate that we can diagnose prostate cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally we extend the study to a large patient dataset utilising tissue microarrays, and show that high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved using high-throughput, rapid data collection, thereby paving the way for practical implementation in the clinic.""","""['Michael J Pilling', 'Alex Henderson', 'Benjamin Bird', 'Mick D Brown', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Peter Gardner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Faraday Discuss""","""['Quantum Cascade Laser Spectral Histopathology: Breast Cancer Diagnostics Using High Throughput Chemical Imaging.', 'Fast infrared chemical imaging with a quantum cascade laser.', 'Large scale infrared imaging of tissue micro arrays (TMAs) using a tunable Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) based microscope.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Infrared micro-spectroscopy coupled with multivariate and machine learning techniques for cancer classification in tissue: a comparison of classification method, performance, and pre-processing technique.', 'Prediction of malignant transformation in oral epithelial dysplasia using infrared absorbance spectra.', 'Colon Cancer Grading Using Infrared Spectroscopic Imaging-Based Deep Learning.', 'Spatially multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization to reveal tumor heterogeneity.', 'A fully automated, faster noise rejection approach to increasing the analytical capability of chemical imaging for digital histopathology.', 'A comparison of mid-infrared spectral regions on accuracy of tissue classification.']"""

Methods:   This was a longitudinal observational pilot study of 34 patients who received choline PET-CT scans with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy. Variables including peak PSA, PSA doubling time (DT), Gleason score, age, initial PSA at diagnosis, use of ADT prior to PET and initial clinical staging were statistically analysed to assess for independent predictive factors for positive PET findings.  Results:   Choline PET-CT was positive in 38.2% of patients (13/34). The only statistically significant predictor for positive PET-CT was the use of ADT prior to PET-CT, with OR 18.7 (95% CI, 2.87-122.45), P < 0.01. Mean peak PSA for patients with positive PET-CT was 5.5 ± 4.8 ng/mL. Patients with positive PET-CT had a mean PSA DT of 5.1 ± 3.8 months and mean total Gleason of 7.6 ± 0.8. Although these variables were not statistically significant, they showed a tendency towards significance. At Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis, a peak PSA value of 1.65 ng/mL and PSA DT of 4.4 months were determined to be the optimal cut-off values predicting positive PET-CT.  Conclusion:   Choline PET-CT has its potential as a diagnostic modality enabling the detection of occult prostate cancer recurrence and to differentiate localised disease from systemic disease thus guiding management. Use of ADT prior to PET-CT is a significant predictor of positive PET-CT.

Our tests show significant differences in trust in physicians among men who do and do not experience uncertainty about the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test during doctor-patient communication. The analysis also indicates that individuals with experiences of uncertainty about the PSA test are more likely than those without such experiences of uncertainty to place their trust in doctors. However, no apparent difference or association exists when there are uncertainties relating to treatment choices regarding slow-growing cancer or treatment side effects. Nevertheless, as hypothesized, individuals who positively evaluate their cancer-related information-seeking experiences are less likely to have fatalistic beliefs about cancer. Furthermore, patients' positive assessments are highly predictive of their levels of trust in their physicians. Additionally, tests of interaction effects show that individuals' levels of education moderate the association between uncertainty experiences about the PSA test and both cancer fatalism and trust in physicians.

NonHispanic black men were marginally more likely to begin active treatment than nonHispanic white men independent of baseline and followup clinical measures (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7). Among men who remained on observation nonHispanic black men were rebiopsied within 24 months of diagnosis at a slightly lower rate than nonHispanic white men (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.6-1.0). Gleason grade progression (HR 3.3, 95% CI 2.7-4.1) and PSA doubling time less than 48 months (HR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3-3.7) were associated with initiation of active treatment independent of race.  Conclusions:   Sociodemographic factors such as ethnicity and education may independently influence the patient decision to pursue active treatment and serial biopsies during active surveillance.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether insurance status predicts for more advanced disease in these four currently screened cancers.  Study design:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for breast, prostate, colorectal and cervix in patients aged 18-64 years. The database was queried from 2007 to 2011, with 425,614 patients with known insurance status included.  Methods:   Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate insurance status and cancer presentation.  Results:   Under multivariate analysis for breast cancer, uninsured patients more often had invasive disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55), T- (OR: 2.00), N- (OR: 1.59) stage, and metastatic disease (OR: 3.48), and were more often high-grade (OR: 1.21). For prostate cancer, uninsured patients again presented more commonly with higher T-stage (OR: 1.45), nodal (OR: 2.90) and metastatic (OR: 4.98) disease, in addition to higher prostate-specific antigen (OR: 2.85) and Gleason score (OR: 1.65). Colorectal cancer had similar findings with uninsured individuals presenting with more invasive disease (OR: 1.78), higher T (OR: 1.86), N (OR: 1.22), and M (OR: 1.58) stage, in addition to higher carcinoembryonic antigen levels (OR: 1.66). Similar results were seen for cervical cancer with uninsured having higher T (OR: 2.03), N (OR: 1.21), and M (OR: 1.45) stage.

Background:   Prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling is implicated in breast and prostate cancer. LFA102, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and inhibits the PRLR, has exhibited promising preclinical antitumor activity.  Methods:   Patients with PRLR-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) received doses of LFA102 at 3-60 mg/kg intravenously once every 4 weeks. Objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) to investigate the safety/tolerability of LFA102 and to assess pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and antitumor activity.  Results:   A total of 73 patients were enrolled at 5 dose levels. The MTD was not reached because of lack of dose-limiting toxicities. The RDE was established at 60 mg/kg based on PK and PD analysis and safety data. The most common all-cause adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (44%) and nausea (33%) regardless of relationship. Grade 3/4 AEs reported to be related to LFA102 occurred in 4% of patients. LFA102 exposure increased approximately dose proportionally across the doses tested. Serum prolactin levels increased in response to LFA102 administration, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for PRLR inhibition. No antitumor activity was detected.

Material and method:   A retrospective study was conducted on 686 patients who underwent prostate biopsy. We analysed the demographic variables, clinical data and biopsy results. To diagnose metabolic syndrome, we employed the criteria of the American Heart Association. For the diagnosis of LOH syndrome, we employed the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male questionnaire and testosterone levels (TT). We evaluated the relationship between free testosterone (FT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) on one hand and PC and its aggressiveness on the other, as well as the usefulness of the TT to prostate specific antigen (TT/PSA) ratio in the PC diagnosis.  Results:   The patient's median age was 65 years. Metabolic syndrome is not associated with PC (39.4% vs. 35%; P=.1) but is associated with a PC Gleason score >7 (50.4% vs. 29.44%; P=.002).

Objective:   To assess the long-term safety of AS for men with screen-detected prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   All men with screen-detected PCa who had very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk PCa and were managed with AS (January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2014) in the Göteborg screening trial.  Intervention:   Prostate-specific antigen tests every 3-12 mo, rebiopsies in cases of clinical progression, and every 2-3 yr in men with stable disease. Triggers for intervention were disease progression (prostate-specific antigen, grade, and/or stage) or patient initiative.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   Treatment-free, failure-free, PCa-specific, and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used.  Results and limitations:   Four-hundred and seventy-four men were managed with AS (median age at diagnosis 66.0 yr, median follow-up 8.0 yr). Two-hundred and two men discontinued AS and initiated treatment. The 10-yr and 15-yr treatment-free survival was 47% and 34%, respectively. The hazard ratio for the treatment for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with very low risk, was 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.94) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.13-2.25). Fifty-four men failed AS. The 10-yr and 15-year failure-free survival was 87% and 72%, respectively. These estimates were 94% and 88% for the very low-risk group, 85% and 77% for the low-risk group, and 73% and 40% for the intermediate-risk group. The hazard ratio for failure for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with very low-risk, was 2.2 (95% CI 1.05-4.47) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.44-9.33). Six men died from PCa and none had very low-risk PCa. The 10-yr and 15-yr PCa-specific survival was 99.5% and 96%, respectively. These estimates were 100% for the very low-risk group, 100% and 94% for the low-risk group, and 98% and 90% for the intermediate-risk group. No predefined protocol was used.  Conclusions:   AS is safe for men with very low-risk PCa, but for men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, AS carries a risk of missing the possibility of being able to cure the cancer. It is questionable whether men who are not in the lowest tumor risk group and who have a long remaining life expectancy are suitable candidates for this strategy.  Patient summary:   Long-term results from this study indicate that some men will miss their chance of cure with active surveillance and it is questionable whether active surveillance is a suitable strategy for men who are not in the lowest tumor risk group and who have a very long remaining life expectancy.""","""['Rebecka Arnsrud Godtman', 'Erik Holmberg', 'Ali Khatami', 'Carl-Gustaf Pihl', 'Johan Stranne', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Expectant Management for Prostate Cancer: Lessons from the Past, Challenges for the Future.', 'Prostate cancer: Caveat Emptor - long-term outcomes in the Göteborg active surveillance cohort.', 'Reply from Authors re: Roderick C.N. van den Bergh, Declan G.

Objectives:   The aim of the study was to translate and linguistically validate a Danish language version of PRO-CTCAE.  Methods:   The U.S. English language PRO-CTCAE was translated into Danish using forward and backward procedures with reconciliation. The linguistic validity of the PRO-CTCAE Danish was examined in two successive rounds of semistructured cognitive interviews in a sample of 56 patients equally distributed by gender and cancer type (prostate, head and neck, lung, breast, gynecological, gastrointestinal, and hematological cancer), and who were currently undergoing cancer treatment.  Results:   In the first round of linguistic validation (n = 42), the phrasing of five symptomatic toxicities was adjusted, and the refined phrasing was retested in a second round of interviews (n = 14). Agreement about phrasing that was both culturally acceptable and semantically comprehensible was achieved in the second round. Statements from participants describing the meaning of the PRO-CTCAE symptomatic toxicities support conceptual equivalence to the U.S. English language version.  Conclusion:   Availability of the NCI PRO-CTCAE in languages beyond English will support international congruence in self-reporting of side effects of cancer treatment.

In prostate cancer for example, these models permit to account for the link between longitudinal measures of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and time of clinical recurrence when studying the risk of relapse. In practice, multiple types of relapse may occur successively. Distinguishing these transitions between health states would allow to evaluate, for example, how PSA trajectory and classical covariates impact the risk of dying after a distant recurrence post-radiotherapy, or to predict the risk of one specific type of clinical recurrence post-radiotherapy, from the PSA history. In this context, we present a joint model for a longitudinal process and a multi-state process, which is divided into two sub-models: a linear mixed sub-model for longitudinal data and a multi-state sub-model with proportional hazards for transition times, both linked by a function of shared random effects. Parameters of this joint multi-state model are estimated within the maximum likelihood framework using an EM algorithm coupled with a quasi-Newton algorithm in case of slow convergence. It is implemented under R, by combining and extending mstate and JM packages. The estimation program is validated by simulations and applied on pooled data from two cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer. Thanks to the classical covariates available at baseline and the repeated PSA measurements, we are able to assess the biomarker's trajectory, define the risks of transitions between health states and quantify the impact of the PSA dynamics on each transition intensity.

In this study, we modulated the surface charge/composition of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) to sustain their blood circulation time and made them small enough to extravasate through the openings of the bone's sinusoidal capillaries and thus localize into marrow. NPs with a neutral surface charge, achieved by modulating the NP surface-associated emulsifier composition, were more effective at localizing to bone marrow than NPs with a cationic or anionic surface charge. These small neutral NPs (~150nm vs. the more usual ~320nm) were also ~7-fold more effective in localizing in bone marrow than large NPs. We hypothesized that NPs that effectively localize to marrow could improve NP-mediated anticancer drug delivery to sites of bone metastasis, thereby inhibiting cancer progression and preventing bone loss. In a PC-3M-luc cell-induced osteolytic intraosseous model of prostate cancer, these small neutral NPs demonstrated greater accumulation in bone within metastatic sites than in normal contralateral bone as well as co-localization with the tumor mass in marrow. Significantly, a single-dose intravenous administration of these small neutral NPs loaded with paclitaxel (PTX-NPs), but not anionic PTX-NPs, slowed the progression of bone metastasis. In addition, neutral PTX-NPs prevented bone loss, whereas animals treated with the rapid-release drug formulation Cremophor EL (PTX-CrEL) or saline (control) showed >50% bone loss. Neutral PTX-NPs did not cause acute toxicity, whereas animals treated with PTX-CrEL experienced weight loss. These results indicate that NPs with appropriate physical and sustained drug-release characteristics could be explored to treat bone metastasis, a significant clinical issue in prostate and other cancers.""","""['Isaac M Adjei', 'Blanka Sharma', 'Chiranjeevi Peetla', 'Vinod Labhasetwar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Reconstituted high density lipoprotein mediated targeted co-delivery of HZ08 and paclitaxel enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in multidrug-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Development and evaluation of a novel TPGS-mediated paclitaxel-loaded PLGA-mPEG nanoparticle for the treatment of ovarian cancer.', 'Synergistic combination treatment to break cross talk between cancer cells and bone cells to inhibit progression of bone metastasis.', 'Paclitaxel drug delivery systems.', 'Current development in the formulations of non-injection administration of paclitaxel.', 'Nanoparticle-mediated synergistic drug combination for treating bone metastasis.', 'Nanoparticle STING Agonist Reprograms the Bone Marrow to an Antitumor Phenotype and Protects Against Bone Destruction.', 'Bone marrow-targetable Green Tea Catechin-Based Micellar Nanocomplex for synergistic therapy of Acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Bone metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma: facts and hopes from clinical and translational perspectives.', 'Biomimetic doxorubicin/ginsenoside co-loading nanosystem for chemoimmunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia.']"""

Methods:   62 patients who underwent MRI before prostatectomy were evaluated. Two readers independently scored the probabilities of tumours in 12 regions of the prostate on T2(*) and ADC images. The data were divided into two groups, i.e. low- vs intermediate- and high-grade PCa, and correlated with the histopathological results. The diagnostic performance parameters, areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves and interreader agreements were calculated.  Results:   For Reader 2, ADC mapping exhibited a greater accuracy for intermediate-grade PCas than for high-grade PCas (0.77 vs 0.83, p < 0.05). For both readers, T2(*) mapping exhibited a greater accuracy for intermediate-grade PCas than for high-grade PCas (Reader 1, 0.86 vs 0.81; Reader 2, 0.83 vs 0.78; p < 0.05).

We assessed MI-219, a small molecule inhibitor of MDM2 with improved pharmacokinetics over nutlin-3, for sensitization of prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, a standard treatment option for men with high-risk prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   The effect of MDM2 inhibition by MI-219 was assessed in vitro and in vivo with mouse xenograft models across multiple prostate cancer cell lines containing varying p53 functional status.  Results:   MDM2 inhibition by MI-219 resulted in dose- and time-dependent p53 activation and decreased clonogenic cell survival after radiation in a p53-dependent manner. Mechanistically, radiosensitization following inhibition of MDM2 was largely the result of p53-dependent increases in apoptosis and DNA damage as evidenced by Annexin V flow cytometry and γ-H2AX foci immunofluorescence. Similarly, treatment with MI-219 enhanced response to antiandrogen therapy via a p53-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death. Lastly, triple therapy with radiation, androgen deprivation therapy, and MI-219 decreased xenograft tumor growth compared with any single- or double-agent treatment.  Conclusion:   MDM2 inhibition with MI-219 results in p53-dependent sensitization of prostate cancer cells to radiation, antiandrogen therapy, and the combination. These findings support MDM2 small molecule inhibitor therapy as a therapy intensification strategy to improve clinical outcomes in high-risk localized prostate cancer.  Translational relevance:   The combination of radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy is a standard treatment option for men with high-risk prostate cancer. Despite improvements in outcomes when androgen deprivation therapy is added to radiation, men with high-risk prostate cancer have significant risk for disease recurrence, progression, and even death within the first 10 years following treatment. We demonstrate that treatment with MI-219 (an inhibitor of MDM2) results in prostate cancer cell sensitization to radiation and androgen deprivation therapy in vitro and in vivo. Triple therapy with MI-219, radiation, and androgen deprivation therapy dramatically decreased tumor growth compared with any single- or double-agent therapy. These findings provide evidence that inhibition of MDM2 is a viable means by which to enhance the efficacy of both radiation and androgen deprivation therapy and thereby improve outcomes in the treatment of prostate cancer. As such, further investigation is warranted to translate these findings to the clinical setting.""","""['Felix Y Feng', 'Yu Zhang', 'Vishal Kothari', 'Joseph R Evans', 'William C Jackson', 'Wei Chen', 'Skyler B Johnson', 'Connor Luczak', 'Shaomeng Wang', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Antisense MDM2 enhances the response of androgen insensitive human prostate cancer cells to androgen deprivation in vitro and in vivo.', 'MDM2 antagonists boost antitumor effect of androgen withdrawal: implications for therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Synergistic roles of p53 and HIF1α in human renal cell carcinoma-cell apoptosis responding to the inhibition of mTOR and MDM2 signaling pathways.', 'Nutlins and ionizing radiation in cancer therapy.', 'The E2F1/Rb and p53/MDM2 pathways in DNA repair and apoptosis: understanding the crosstalk to develop novel strategies for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'MDM2- an indispensable player in tumorigenesis.', 'Identification of Critical Molecular Factors and Side Effects Underlying the Response to Thalicthuberine in Prostate Cancer: A Systems Biology Approach.', 'Replication Stress: A Review of Novel Targets to Enhance Radiosensitivity-From Bench to Clinic.', 'Functional roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary evaluation of a small interfering RNA molecular probe targeting murine double minute 2 in breast cancer.']"""

We investigated whether this stage migration has persisted in a contemporary analysis of a population-based statewide cancer registry.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, a statewide registry of all newly diagnosed cancers. Data were collected on prostate cancers diagnosed between 1992 and 2012. We determined age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, as well as the distribution of tumor stage (localized, regional, or metastatic) at diagnosis, and assessed for changes in these variables over time using joinpoint analysis.  Results:   Between 1992 and 2012, 210,831 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in Pennsylvania, and 33,948 men died of disease. Age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates, and specifically the incidence of localized disease, have decreased dramatically since 2007 to 2008. Due to the decreased diagnosis of localized disease, regional and metastatic tumors have made up a greater percentage of all prostate cancer diagnoses in recent years, despite a relatively stable incidence of these advanced stage tumors.  Conclusions:   Over the past 2 decades, age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates in Pennsylvania have decreased, primarily because of the decreased detection of early-stage disease. There has been a corresponding shift toward more advanced disease at diagnosis. These findings may be explained by the decreased use of prostate-specific antigen-based screening, among other factors. The 2012 United States Preventative Services Task Force recommendations against prostate cancer screening may exacerbate this concerning trend, potentially resulting in an increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality.""","""['Adam C Reese', 'Sean R Wessel', 'Susan G Fisher', 'Jack H Mydlo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates and Prevalence of Prostate Specific Antigen Screening by Socioeconomic Status and Regions in the United States, 2004 to 2013.', 'Increase in the Annual Rate of Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Database.', 'Prostate cancer incidence across stage, NCCN risk groups, and age before and after USPSTF Grade D recommendations against prostate-specific antigen screening in 2012.', 'Impact of screening on prostate cancer rates and trends.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'Changes in Prostate Cancer Presentation Following the 2012 USPSTF Screening Statement: Observational Study in a Multispecialty Group Practice.', 'The increase of stage, grading, and metastases in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy during the last decade.', 'Spatial-temporal analysis of prostate cancer incidence from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, 2000-2011.', 'Past, Current, and Future Incidence Rates and Burden of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the United States.', 'Use of Digital Rectal Examination as an Adjunct to Prostate Specific Antigen in the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.']"""

In addition to supporting the survival of healthy cells, AIF also plays a contributory role to the development of cancer through its enzymatic activity, and we have previously shown that AIF preferentially supports advanced-stage prostate cancer cells. Here we further evaluated the role of AIF in tumorigenesis by exploring its function in pancreatic cancer, a disease setting that most often presents at an advanced stage by the time of diagnosis.  Methods:   A bioinformatics approach was first employed to investigate AIF mRNA transcript levels in pancreatic tumor specimens vs. normal tissues. AIF-deficient pancreatic cancer cell lines were then established via lentiviral infection. Immunoblot analysis was used to determine relative protein quantities within cells. Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry; in vitro and Matrigel™ growth/survival using Coulter™ counting and phase contrast microscopy; and glucose consumption in the absence and presence of Matrigel™ using spectrophotometric methods.  Results:   Archival gene expression data revealed a modest elevation of AIF transcript levels in subsets of pancreatic tumor specimens, suggesting a possible role in disease progression. AIF expression was then suppressed in a panel of five pancreatic cancer cell lines that display diverse metabolic phenotypes. AIF ablation selectively crippled the growth of cells in vitro in a manner that directly correlated with the loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits and altered glucose metabolism, and these effects were exacerbated in the presence of Matrigel™ substrate. This suggests a critical metabolic role for AIF to pancreatic tumorigenesis, while the spectrum of sensitivities to AIF ablation depends on basal cellular metabolic phenotypes.  Conclusions:   Altogether these data indicate that AIF supports the growth and survival of metabolically defined pancreatic cancer cells and that this metabolic function may derive from a novel mechanism so far undocumented in other cancer types.""","""['Andrew J Scott', 'Amanda S Wilkinson', 'John C Wilkinson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The enzymatic activity of apoptosis-inducing factor supports energy metabolism benefiting the growth and invasiveness of advanced prostate cancer cells.', 'Apoptosis-inducing factor is involved in gentamicin-induced vestibular hair cell death.', 'The roles of AIF and Endo G in the apoptotic effects of benzyl isothiocyanate on DU 145 human prostate cancer cells via the mitochondrial signaling pathway.', 'The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in tumor cells.', 'Apoptosis-inducing factor: structure, function, and redox regulation.', 'Apoptosis-inducing factor: a mitochondrial protein associated with metabolic diseases-a narrative review.', 'Allograft inflammatory factor 1 is a potential diagnostic, immunological, and prognostic biomarker in pan-cancer.', 'Novel mutation in hexokinase 2 confers resistance to 2-deoxyglucose by altering protein dynamics.', 'Prognostic Value of Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF) in Germ Cell Tumors.', 'Functionally significant metabolic differences between B and T lymphocyte lineages.']"""

Objective:   To develop a multimodal model, incorporating previously identified messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers and traditional risk factors that could be used to identify patients with high-grade PCa (Gleason score ≥7) on prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   In two prospective multicenter studies, urine was collected for mRNA profiling after digital rectal examination (DRE) and prior to prostate biopsy. The multimodal risk score was developed on a first cohort (n=519) and subsequently validated clinically in an independent cohort (n=386).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The mRNA levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to model patient risk and combine risk factors. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, and clinical utility was evaluated with a decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results and limitations:   HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels were shown to be good predictors for the detection of high-grade PCa. The multimodal approach reached an overall AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95) in the validation cohort (AUC 0.86 in the training cohort), with the mRNA signature, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, and previous cancer-negative prostate biopsies as the strongest, most significant components, in addition to nonsignificant model contributions of PSA, age, and family history. For another model, which included DRE as an additional risk factor, an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.92) was obtained (AUC 0.90 in the training cohort). Both models were successfully validated, with no significant change in AUC in the validation cohort, and DCA indicated a strong net benefit and the best reduction in unnecessary biopsies compared with other clinical decision-making tools, such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator and the PCA3 assay.  Conclusions:   The risk score based on the mRNA liquid biopsy assay combined with traditional clinical risk factors identified men at risk of harboring high-grade PCa and resulted in a better patient risk stratification compared with current methods in clinical practice. Therefore, the risk score could reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.  Patient summary:   This study evaluated a novel urine-based assay that could be used as a noninvasive diagnostic aid for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa).

The aim of the present report was to suggest, using a trial-level analysis, what might be the most appropriate EPs for trials of new drugs for patients with mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   A literature search of randomized trials of medical treatments in patients with mCRPC was undertaken. The response-related and time-to-event EPs were evaluated. For each trial, the differences in OS and the examined EPs between the experimental and control arms and a correlation coefficient for every relationship were calculated. An additional regression analysis was performed to determine the proportion of variability explained (R2trial) on OS for the most frequently reported EPs in the selected trials.  Results:   A total of 28 studies were included in the present analysis. Correlation analyses documented a significant relationship between the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-related response rate and OS. Although not significant, a strong correlation coefficient was found for the relationship of radiologic progression-free survival (PFS) and OS and of PSA-related PFS and OS.

Conclusion:   The PSA response rate and radiologic PFS reported greater rates of correlation with OS among trials of medical treatments of mCRPC, in particular, in studies published in the past 10 years.

In addition, upregulation of Cyclin D2 and incorporation of [methyl-(3)H]thymidine induced by 17β-estradiol and DPN were blocked by the ERβ-selective antagonist PHTPP in PC-3 cells. Upregulation of Cyclin D2 and incorporation of [methyl-(3)H]thymidine induced by DPN were also blocked by PKF118-310, a compound that disrupts β-catenin-TCF (T-cell-specific transcription factor) complex, suggesting the involvement of β-catenin in the estradiol effects in PC-3 cells. A diffuse immunostaining for non-phosphorylated β-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm of PC-3 cells. Low levels of non-phosphorylated β-catenin immunostaining were also detected near the plasma membrane and in nuclei. Treatment of PC-3 cells with 17β-estradiol or DPN markedly increased non-phosphorylated β-catenin expression. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with the ERβ-selective antagonist PHTPP, PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin or AKT inhibitor MK-2206, indicating that ERβ-PI3K/AKT mediates non-phosphorylated β-catenin expression. Cycloheximide blocked the DPN-induced upregulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin, suggesting de novo synthesis of this protein.

Because acute bacterial infection in human prostate tissues is relatively rare, the disease relevance of the bacterial infection-induced basal-to-luminal differentiation is uncertain. Herein we employ a high fat diet-induced sterile prostate inflammation model to determine whether basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by inflammation irrespective of the underlying etiologies. A K14-CreER model and a fluorescent report line are utilized to specifically label basal cells with the green fluorescent protein. We show that high fat diet promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate tissues and basal-to-luminal differentiation. Increased cell proliferation accompanies basal-to-luminal differentiation, suggesting a concurrent regulation of basal cell proliferation and differentiation. This study demonstrates that basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by different types of prostate inflammation evolved with distinct etiologies. Finally, high fat diet also accelerates initiation and progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are originated from basal cells with loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor Pten.

Androgens play an essential role in the development, growth, and maintenance of male sex organs, as well as the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems. Yet with advancing age, androgens can drive the onset of prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in males within the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by pharmacologic and/or surgical castration induces apoptosis of prostate cells and subsequent shrinkage of the prostate and prostate tumors. However, ADT is associated with significant musculoskeletal and behavioral adverse effects. The unique pharmacological activity of selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) MK-4541 recently has been reported as an AR antagonist with 5α-reductase inhibitor function. The molecule inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in AR positive, androgen dependent prostate cancer cells. Importantly, MK-4541 inhibited androgen-dependent prostate growth in male rats yet maintained lean body mass and bone formation following ovariectomy in female rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SARM MK-4541 in the androgen-dependent Dunning R3327-G prostate carcinoma xenograft mouse model as well as on skeletal muscle mass and function, and AR-regulated behavior in mice. MK-4541 significantly inhibited the growth of R3327-G prostate tumors, exhibited anti-androgen effects on the seminal vesicles, reduced plasma testosterone concentrations in intact males, and inhibited Ki67 expression. MK-4541 treated xenografts appeared similar to xenografts in castrated mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that MK-4541 exhibited anabolic activity in androgen deficient conditions, increasing lean body mass and muscle function in adult castrated mice. Moreover, MK-4541 treatment restored general activity levels in castrated mice. Thus, MK-4541 exhibits an optimum profile as an adjuvant therapy to ADT which may provide potent anti-androgenic activity at the prostate yet protective activity on skeletal muscle and behavior in patients.""","""['Michael J Chisamore', 'Michael A Gentile', 'Gregory Michael Dillon', 'Matthew Baran', 'Carlo Gambone', 'Sean Riley', 'Azriel Schmidt', 'Osvaldo Flores', 'Hilary Wilkinson', 'Stephen E Alves']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulator treatment improves muscle strength and body composition and prevents bone loss in orchidectomized rats.', 'Comparison of the pharmacological effects of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide in intact rats: new approach for benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Combined Effects of Exercise and Phytoanabolic Extracts in Castrated Male and Female Mice.', 'Growth Hormone/Insulin Growth Factor Axis in Sex Steroid Associated Disorders and Related Cancers.', 'Muscle Wasting and Sarcopenia in Heart Failure-The Current State of Science.', 'Androgen receptor co-regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators: the future of androgen therapy?']"""

Methods:   Between January 1989 and July 2010, 3647 patients underwent surgery at our institution for a renal cortical neoplasm and were followed through 2012. Occurrence of other malignancies was classified as antecedent, synchronous, or subsequent. All patients with antecedent malignancies (n = 498) and a randomly selected half of those with synchronous malignancies (n = 83) were excluded. The expected number of second primaries was calculated by multiplying Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program incidence rates of renal cortical neoplasms by person-years at risk within categories of age, sex, and year of diagnosis. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as observed cancers divided by expected incidence of the cancer, with approximation to the exact Poisson test used to obtain confidence intervals (CI) and p values.  Results:   Of 3066 patients with renal cortical neoplasms, 267 had a second primary cancer; the five most common in men were prostate, colorectal, bladder, lung, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the five most common in women were breast, colorectal, lung, endometrium, and thyroid. Men demonstrated higher than expected thyroid cancer rate (SIR 5.0; 95 % CI 1.83-10.88, p = 0.002), and women had higher than expected rates of stomach cancer (SIR 5.0; 95 % CI 1.61-11.67, p = 0.004) and thyroid cancer (SIR 4.62; 95 % CI 1.69-10.05, p = 0.003).

TXL-induced responses were modulated in the presence of TG with increased accumulation of cells at G1-phase, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, and changes in cytokine release. Cytoskeletal rearrangement was associated with modulation of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial unfolded protein response leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and release of proapoptotic proteins from mitochondria. TXL in combination with APC or TG enhanced caspase activation. Importantly, TXL in combination with TG induced caspase activation and apoptosis in X-ray resistant LNCaP cells. Increased release of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) was observed while phosphorylated β-catenin level was suppressed with TXL combination treatments. This was accompanied by a decrease in the CD44(+)CD133(+) cancer stem cell-like population, suggesting treatment affects cancer stem cell properties.

A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis""","""Introduction:   The present study evaluated the incidence and prognostic value of second primary cancers in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   From 2003 to 2013, 1915 patients who had undergone RP were included in the present analysis. We calculated the propensity scores of various clinicopathologic factors and matched 298 patients with and without second primary cancers in a 1:1 ratio. To assess the baseline variables, we compared the descriptive statistics between the 2 groups. The postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors of BCR after RP.  Results:   Overall, 159 patients with PCa (8.3%) who had undergone RP were diagnosed with second primary cancers. After adjusting the patient characteristics in the propensity score-matched analysis, no variables were significantly different between the 2 groups with 149 with and 149 without other primary cancers. Moreover, the BCR-free survival rates were not significantly associated with the incidence of a second primary malignancy or the time to diagnosis. In the multivariate Cox regression model, serum prostate-specific antigen (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04), extraprostatic extension (HR, 3.29), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI; HR, 2.85), and surgical margin positivity (HR, 4.11) remained as independent predictors for BCR. However, the presence of a second primary malignancy was not predictive for BCR. In patients with a second primary cancer, multivariate analysis identified SVI (HR, 10.38) and positive surgical margin (HR, 3.48) as significant predictors for BCR.

Arl8b is a lysosome localized Arf-like GTPase that controls the spatial distribution of lysosomes via recruitment of kinesin motors. Common features of the tumor microenvironment such as acidic extracellular pH and various growth factors stimulate lysosome trafficking to the cell periphery (anterograde), which is critical for tumor invasion by facilitating the release of lysosomal proteases to promote matrix remodeling. Herein we report for the first time that Arl8b regulates anterograde lysosome trafficking in response to hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and acidic extracellular pH. Depletion of Arl8b results in juxtanuclear lysosome aggregation, and this effect corresponds with both diminished invasive growth and proteolytic extracellular matrix degradation in a three-dimensional model of prostate cancer. Strikingly, we found that depletion of Arl8b abolishes the ability of prostate cancer cells to establish subcutaneous xenografts in mice. We present evidence that Arl8b facilitates lipid hydrolysis to maintain efficient metabolism for a proliferative capacity in low nutrient environments, suggesting a likely explanation for the complete inability of Arl8b-depleted tumor cells to grow in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified two mechanisms by which Arl8b regulates cancer progression: 1) through lysosome positioning and protease release leading to an invasive phenotype and 2) through control of lipid metabolism to support cellular proliferation. These novel roles highlight that Arl8b is a potential target for the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics.""","""['Samantha S Dykes', 'Alana L Gray', 'David T Coleman', 'Madhurima Saxena', 'Charles A Stephens', 'Jennifer L Carroll', 'Kevin Pruitt', 'James A Cardelli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['RUFY3 links Arl8b and JIP4-Dynein complex to regulate lysosome size and positioning.', 'Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox-1 (Zeb1) drives anterograde lysosome trafficking and tumor cell invasion via upregulation of Na+/H+ Exchanger-1 (NHE1).', 'Hepatitis C virus infection increases autophagosome stability by suppressing lysosomal fusion through an Arl8b-dependent mechanism.', 'Arf-like GTPase Arl8: Moving from the periphery to the center of lysosomal biology.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'BORC complex specific components and Kinesin-1 mediate autophagy evasion by the autophagy-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strain.', 'Transcription factor EB regulates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate levels that control lysosome positioning in the bladder cancer model.', 'Oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of JIP4 regulates lysosomal positioning in coordination with TRPML1 and ALG2.', 'ARL11 correlates with the immunosuppression and poor prognosis in breast cancer: A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of ARL family members.', 'RUFY3 links Arl8b and JIP4-Dynein complex to regulate lysosome size and positioning.']"""

Analysis of MET protein expression and genetic alterations might contribute to therapeutic stratification of prostate cancer patients. Our objective was to investigate MET on protein, DNA and RNA level in clinical prostate cancer at various stages of progression. Expression of MET was analyzed in hormone-naive primary prostate cancers (N=481), lymph node (N=40) and bone (N=8) metastases, as well as HRPC (N=54) and bone metastases (N=15). MET protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (D1C2 C-terminal antibody). MET mRNA levels and MET DNA copy numbers were determined by in situ hybridization. None of the hormone-naive primary prostate cancer or lymph node metastases demonstrated MET protein or mRNA expression. In contrast, MET protein was expressed in 12/52 (23%) evaluable HRPC resections. RNA in situ demonstrated cytoplasmic signals in 14/54 (26%) of the HRPC patients, and was associated with MET protein expression (p=0.025, χ2), in absence of MET amplification or polysomy.

Ccnd1 activates the transcription of a large set of genes involved in cell cycle progress and proliferation. However, Ccnd1 also targets cytoplasmic proteins involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion. In this work, we have analyzed by immunohistochemistry the localization of Ccnd1 in endometrial, breast, prostate and colon carcinomas with different types of invasion. The number of cells displaying membranous or cytoplasmic Ccnd1 was significantly higher in peripheral cells than in inner cells in both collective and pushing invasion patterns of endometrial carcinoma, and in collective invasion pattern of colon carcinoma. Also, the cytoplasmic localization of Ccnd1 was higher when tumors infiltrated as single cells, budding or small clusters of cells. To evaluate cytoplasmic function of cyclin D1, we have built a variant (Ccnd1-CAAX) that remains attached to the cell membrane therefore sequestering this cyclin in the cytoplasm. Tumor cells harboring Ccnd1-CAAX showed high levels of invasiveness and metastatic potential compared to those containing the wild type allele of Ccnd1. However, Ccnd1-CAAX expression did not alter proliferative rates of tumor cells. We hypothesize that the role of Ccnd1 in the cytoplasm is mainly associated with the invasive capability of tumor cells.

It is overexpressed in certain cancers and is viewed as a promising therapeutic target. However, the prognostic role of STEAP1 is still controversial, and no role for STEAP1 has yet been indicated in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association of STEAP1 expression with colorectal cancer prognosis. STEAP1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue array of 165 cancer specimens from primary colorectal cancer patients. The mean and medium follow-up times after surgery were 5.1 and 3.9 years, respectively. A total of 139 patients died during the 13 years of follow-up in the survey period. The prognostic value of STEAP1 with respect to overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. In total, 164 samples displayed detectable STEAP1 expression in the cytoplasm and membrane. Low STEAP1 expression was correlated with poor overall survival (five-year survival: 33.7% vs. 57.0%, low expression vs. high expression, p = 0.020). Accordingly, multivariate analysis identified low STEAP1 expression as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio = 1.500, p = 0.018), especially in elderly patients or those with late stage cancers, late T values, and early N values. We suggest that analysis of STEAP1 expression by immunohistochemical staining could serve as an independent prognostic marker for colorectal patients.

There are no studies comparing surgical and pharmacological castration with regards to their metabolic side effects. The aim of this study was to compare both modalities.  Methods:   A prospective observational study was conducted in men with PCa and with indications of any ADT. The participants were divided into two groups: (1) bilateral orchiectomy and (2) LHRH analogs. The metabolic profile was assessed before and during the period of ADT. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and bone mineral density were measured before and after 6 months of treatment. The data were analyzed using the Chi-squared test, Student's t test, Bonferroni's test, and ANOVA.  Results:   We enrolled 102 men for analysis, of whom 46 (54.9 %) had been subjected to bilateral orchiectomy and 56 (54.9 %) had been subjected to treatment with LHRH analogs. The basal metabolic profile, body mass index, and BIA were similar between the two groups. The oncologic control (PSA and testosterone) was also similar in both groups. In the intergroup comparison, insulin resistance (p = 0.044) and hemoglobin (p = 0.001) were worse in the group that used LHRH analogs, which was mainly diabetic patients (p = 0.007).

In this study, we characterize the expression of lncRNAs in several prostate cancer exosomes and their parental cell lines. We show that certain lncRNAs are enriched in cancer exosomes with the overall expression signatures varying across cell lines. These exosomal lncRNAs are themselves enriched for miRNA seeds with a preference for let-7 family members as well as miR-17, miR-18a, miR-20a, miR-93 and miR-106b. The enrichment of miRNA seed regions in exosomal lncRNAs is matched with a concomitant high expression of the same miRNA. In addition, the exosomal lncRNAs also showed an over representation of RNA binding protein binding motifs. The two most common motifs belonged to ELAVL1 and RBMX. Given the enrichment of miRNA and RBP sites on exosomal lncRNAs, their interplay may suggest a possible function in prostate cancer carcinogenesis.""","""['Alireza Ahadi', 'Samuel Brennan', 'Paul J Kennedy', 'Gyorgy Hutvagner', 'Nham Tran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Exosomal lncRNAs and cancer: connecting the missing links.', 'Analysis of the miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA networks in ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines.', 'The functional roles of exosomal long non-coding RNAs in cancer.', 'Transcriptome and long noncoding RNA sequencing of three extracellular vesicle subtypes released from the human colon cancer LIM1863 cell line.', 'Mechanism of Tumor-Platelet Communications in Cancer.', 'Using Small Non-Coding RNAs in Extracellular Vesicles of Semen as Biomarkers of Male Reproductive System Health: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Exploiting the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles for bioengineering and therapeutic cargo loading.', 'Exosomal noncoding RNAs in central nervous system diseases: biological functions and potential clinical applications.', 'LncRNA GAS5 Suppresses Colorectal Cancer Progress by Target miR-21/LIFR Axis.']"""

It has recently been used as a chemopreventive agent. It may also have some beneficial effects to treat prostate cancer by inhibiting androgen production. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of apigenin on the steroidogenesis of rat immature Leydig cells and some human testosterone biosynthetic enzyme activities. Rat immature Leydig cells were incubated for 3h with 100μM apigenin without (basal) or with 1ng/ml luteinizing hormone (LH), 10mM 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8BR), and 20μM of the following steroid substrates: 22R-hydroxychloesterol (22R), pregnenolone (P5), progesterone (P4), and androstenedione (D4). The medium levels of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol (DIOL), the primary androgen produced by rat immature Leydig cells, were measured. Apigenin significantly inhibited basal, 8BR, 22R, PREG, P4, and D4 stimulated DIOL production in rat immature Leydig cells. Further study showed that apigenin inhibited rat 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17α-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 with IC50 values of 11.41±0.7, 8.98±0.10, and 9.37±0.07μM, respectively. Apigenin inhibited human 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 with IC50 values of 2.17±0.04 and 1.31±0.09μM, respectively. Apigenin is a potent inhibitor of rat and human steroidogenic enzymes, being possible use for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xiudi Wang', 'Guimin Wang', 'Xiaoheng Li', 'Jianpeng Liu', 'Tingting Hong', 'Qiqi Zhu', 'Ping Huang', 'Ren-Shan Ge']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Fitoterapia""","""['Taxifolin suppresses rat and human testicular androgen biosynthetic enzymes.', 'Effects of Etomidate on the Steroidogenesis of Rat Immature Leydig Cells.', 'Effects of dexmedetomidine on the steroidogenesis of rat immature Leydig cells.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Androgen biosynthetic pathways in the human prostate.', 'Improvement of Testicular Steroidogenesis Using Flavonoids and Isoflavonoids for Prevention of Late-Onset Male Hypogonadism.']"""

This study examined the meaning and consequences of erectile dysfunction (ED) and other sexual changes in 124 GB men with PCa and 21 male partners, through an on-line survey. A sub-sample of 46 men with PCa and seven partners also took part in a one-to-one interview. ED was reported by 72 % of survey respondents, associated with reports of emotional distress, negative impact on gay identities, and feelings of sexual disqualification. Other sexual concerns included loss of libido, climacturia, loss of sensitivity or pain during anal sex, non-ejaculatory orgasms, and reduced penis size. Many of these changes have particular significance in the context of gay sex and gay identities, and can result in feelings of exclusion from a sexual community central to GB men's lives. However, a number of men were reconciled to sexual changes, did not experience a challenge to identity, and engaged in sexual re-negotiation. The nature of GB relationships, wherein many men are single, engage in casual sex, or have concurrent partners, influenced experiences of distress, identity, and renegotiation. It is concluded that researchers and clinicians need to be aware of the meaning and consequences of sexual changes for GB men when designing studies to examine the impact of PCa on men's sexuality, advising GB men of the sexual consequences of PCa, and providing information and support to ameliorate sexual changes.""","""['Jane M Ussher', 'Janette Perz', 'Duncan Rose', 'Gary W Dowsett', 'Suzanne Chambers', 'Scott Williams', 'Ian Davis', 'David Latini']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Arch Sex Behav""","""[""Let's talk about gay sex: gay and bisexual men's sexual communication with healthcare professionals after prostate cancer."", 'Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', ""Australian gay and bisexual men's use of erectile dysfunction medications during recent sexual encounters."", 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.', 'Sexual problems in homo- and bisexual men - the context of the issue.', 'Editorial: Cancer prevention, treatment and survivorship in the LGBTQIA community.', 'Precarious Manhood Beliefs Are Positively Associated with Erectile Dysfunction in Cisgender Men.', '""Ultimately, You Realize You\'re on Your Own"": The Impact of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men Couples.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Development of a Training to Address Needs of Sexual and Gender Minority Prostate Cancer Survivors: Results of Formative Research.']"""

Patients and methods:   Medical records from 421 consecutive patients treated with first-line docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) and low-dose prednisolone from 2007 to 2013 at Herlev University Hospital were reviewed. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 guidelines were used to evaluate treatment-related toxicity and efficacy. Logistic and Cox regression models were used to predict toxicity and survival.  Results:   Age ≥ 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.33), baseline levels of hemoglobin (OR, 0.89), and previous metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC; OR, 1.70) were predictive of grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Previous MESCC was associated with a greater risk of febrile neutropenia (OR, 2.74). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.4 and 15.4 months, respectively. Survival was similar in the older (age ≥ 75 years) and younger patients (PPFS = .66, POS = .90; log-rank) and when comparing patients undergoing dose reductions with patients treated with standard docetaxel throughout their treatment course (PPFS = .51 and POS = 0.52; log-rank). A longer interval from the primary diagnosis to the initiation of docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00), baseline hemoglobin levels (HR, 0.85), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status > 0 to 1 (HR, 1.44), lactate dehydrogenase greater than the upper limit of normal (HR, 1.64), and prostate-specific antigen levels (HR, 1.00) were predictors of OS.

To achieve these goals, we generated tissue specific conditional PKCε knockout mice (PKCε-CKO) using cre-lox technology. Homozygous PKCε(LoxP/LoxP) mice have normal body weight and phenotype. To determine what effect loss of PKCε would have on the prostate, the PKCε(LoxP/LoxP) mice were bred to probasin cre (PB-Cre4+) mice which express cre specifically in the prostate epithelium of postnatal mice. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced levels of PKCε specifically in the prostate of PKCε-CKO mice. Histopathological analyses of prostate from both PKCε(LoxP/LoxP) and prostate PKCε-CKO mice showed normal pathology. To determine the functional impact of prostate specific deletion of PKCε on prostate tumor growth, we performed an orthotopic xenograft study. Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) cells (TRAMPC1, 2×106) were implanted in the prostate of PKCε-CKO mice. Mice were sacrificed at 6th week post-implantation. Results demonstrated a significant (P<0.05) decrease in the growth of TRAMPC1 cells-derived xenograft tumors in PKCε-CKO mice compared to wild type. To determine a link of PKCε to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure-induced epidermal Stat3 phosphorylation, PKCε(LoxP/LoxP) mice were bred to tamoxifen-inducible K14 Cre mice.

Methods:   Data was obtained from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer trial, a randomized multi-center trial conducted to determine if screening could reduce mortality in these cancers. The trial enrolled 78,216 women, randomized into either a screening arm with annual serum cancer antigen 125 and pelvic ultrasounds, or usual care arm. This study identified a subgroup that reported a first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer. Analysis was performed to compare overall mortality and disease specific mortality in the screening versus usual care arm. In patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage distribution, and survival were analyzed as a secondary endpoint.  Results:   There was no significant difference in overall mortality or disease specific mortality between the two arms. Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 48 patients in the screening arm and 44 patients in the usual care arm. Screened patients were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage than usual care patients. Patients in the screening arm diagnosed with ovarian cancer experienced a significantly improved survival compared to patients in the usual care arm; relative risk 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93).  Conclusion:   Screening did not appear to decrease ovarian cancer mortality in participants with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.

We prospectively evaluated the cancer detection rate at each overall PI-RADSv2 score.  Materials and methods:   This prospective study included 62 consecutive patients with 116 lesions who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging at 3T with PI-RADSv2 evaluation and subsequent targeted magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy and concurrent 12-core systematic prostate biopsy between May and September 2015. Median patient age and prostate specific antigen values were 65.5 years (range 50.3 to 76.6) and 7.10 ng/ml (range 0.47 to 863.0), respectively. Mean lesion size was 12.7 mm overall. Lesion based cancer detection rates for all tumors and for Gleason 3+4 or greater tumors at each PI-RADSv2 score were calculated. Univariate analysis was performed to assess differences in the cancer detection rate among PI-RADSv2 scores.  Results:   A total of 116 lesions in 62 patients were evaluated prospectively (0 PI-RADS 1, 18 PI-RADS 2, 19 PI-RADS 3, 47 PI-RADS 4, 32 PI-RADS 5), and the patients underwent magnetic resonance/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy and systematic biopsy. Histopathology revealed 55 of 116 (47.4%) cancers (17 Gleason 3+3, 16 Gleason 3+4, 6 Gleason 4+3, 12 Gleason 4+4, 3 Gleason 4+5 and 1 Gleason 5+4). Based on targeted biopsy on a per lesion basis, the overall cancer detection rates of PI-RADS 2, 3, 4 and 5 scores for all tumors was 22.2%, 15.8%, 29.8% and 78.1%, respectively. The cancer detection rate of PI-RADS 2, 3, 4 and 5 scores for Gleason 3+4 or greater tumors was 5.6%, 0%, 21.3% and 75%, respectively. Differences in the cancer detection rate between overall PI-RADS 4 and 5 scores were significant (p <0.001 for Gleason greater than 3+3 and Gleason 3+4 or greater cancers).  Conclusions:   A PI-RADS score of 5 had the highest prospective cancer detection rate (78%). A PI-RADS score of 4 had only a 30% cancer detection rate, which is lower than expected. Surprisingly, no or few significant cancers were detected at a PI-RADS score of 3 (16%). These early prospective data suggest that current criteria result in a high false-positive rate that lowers the cancer detection rate. Therefore, stricter criteria may be needed in the future to decrease false-positives and increase the cancer detection rate for PI-RADS scores of 3, 4 and 5.""","""['Francesca V Mertan', 'Matthew D Greer', 'Joanna H Shih', 'Arvin K George', 'Michael Kongnyuy', 'Akhil Muthigi', 'Maria J Merino', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Risk Stratification of Equivocal Lesions on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for Prostate Cancer Detection with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Diagnostic Meta-analysis.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Prostate imaging-reporting and data system version 2 in combination with clinical parameters for prostate cancer detection: a single center experience.', 'Clinical value of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Radiomics-based machine-learning method to diagnose prostate cancer using mp-MRI: a comparison between conventional and fused models.', 'Magnetic Resonance Image Compilation Was Used in Conjunction with Prostate PI-RADS v2.1 Score Has Diagnostic Relevance for Benign and Malignant Prostate Lesions.']"""

However, the rarity of these sorted cells limits the investigation of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies targeting PrTICs. For PrTIC enrichment, we induced cancer stem cell (CSC) properties in PrCa cells by transducing three defined factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, and KLF4), followed by culture with conventional serum-containing medium. The CSC properties in the transduced cells were evaluated by proliferation, cell cycle, SP assay, drug sensitivity technology, in vivo tumorigenicity, and molecular marker analysis of PrCSCs compared with parental cells and spheroids. After culture with serum-containing medium for 8 days, the PrCa cells transduced with the three factors showed significantly enhanced CSC properties in terms of marker gene expression, sphere formation, chemoresistance to docetaxel, and tumorigenicity.

Patients and methods:   In all, 282 patients who underwent TBx after previous negative SBx and a PCA3 urine assay, were enrolled. The associations between PCA3 score/PI-RADS and PCA3 score/Gleason score were investigated by K-means clustering, a receiver operating characteristic analysis and binary logistic regression.  Results:   The PCA3 score difference for the negative vs positive TBx cohorts was highly statistically significant. A 1-unit increase in the PCA3 score was associated to a 2.4% increased risk of having a positive TBx result. A PCA3 score of >80 and a PI-RADS grade of ≥4 were independent predictors of a positive TBx. The association between the PCA3 score and PI-RADS grade was statistically significant (the median PCA3 score for PI-RADS grade groups 3, 4, and 5 was 58, 104, and 146, respectively; P = 0.006). A similar pattern was detected for the relationship between the PCA3 score and Gleason score; an increasing PCA3 score was associated with a worsening Gleason score (median PCA3 score equal to 62, 105, 132, 153, 203, and 322 for Gleason Score 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, 4+5, 5+4, and 5+5, respectively; P < 0.001).

Methodology:   Morbidity and mortality data were collected from official documents and from Health Information Systems. In parallel, the diseases reported in the two major newspapers of Espírito Santo in 2011-2012 were identified from 10,771 news articles. Concomitantly, eight interviews were conducted with reporters from the two newspapers to understand the journalists' reasons for the coverage or neglect of certain health/disease topics.  Principal findings:   Quantitatively, the DNMs identified diseases associated with poverty, including tuberculosis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and trachoma. Apart from these, diseases with outbreaks in the period evaluated, including whooping cough and meningitis, some cancers, respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke, were also seldom addressed by the media. In contrast, dengue fever, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, tracheal cancer, and bronchial and lung cancers were broadly covered in the period analysed, corroborating the tradition of media disclosure of these diseases. Qualitatively, the DNMs included rare diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), leishmaniasis, Down syndrome, and verminoses. The reasons for the neglect of these topics by the media included the political and economic interests of the newspapers, their editorial line, and the organizational routine of the newsrooms.

Methods:   Cell death, cell cycle, and mitochondrial function/stress were analysed by flow cytometry or by Seahorse XF24 analyzer. Expression of cellular proteins was determined using immunoblotting and real-time PCR analyses. Cell survival/motility was evaluated by clonogenic, cell migration, and gelatin zymography assays.  Results:   Glycolytic pathway inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibited cell proliferation in both AA PCa cells (AA cells) and CA PCa cells (CA cells). AA cells possess reduced endogenous reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (mtMP), and mitochondrial mass compared with CA cells. DCA upregulated mtMP in both cell types, whereas mitochondrial mass was significantly increased in CA cells. DCA enhanced taxol-induced cell death in CA cells while sensitising AA cells to doxorubicin. Reduced expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was observed in AA cells, whereas DCA induced expression of CHOP, C/EBP, HSP60, and HSP90 in CA cells.

WFDC1/ps20 expression is frequently downregulated or lost in prostate cancer (PCa) and ps20 has demonstrated growth-suppressive functions in numerous tumour model systems, although the mechanisms of this phenomenon are not understood.  Methods:   Ps20 was cloned and overexpressed in DU145, PC3, LNCaP and WPMY-1 cells. Cellular growth, cell cycle and apoptosis were characterised. WPMY-1 stromal cells expressing ps20 were characterised by transcriptome microarray and the function of WPMY-1 conditioned media on growth of PCa cell lines was assessed.  Results:   Prostrate stromal 20 expression enhanced the proliferation of LNCaP cells, whereas stromal WPMY-1 cells were inhibited and underwent increased apoptosis. Prostrate stromal 20-expressing WPMY-1 cells secrete a potently proapoptotic conditioned media. Prostrate stromal 20 overexpression upregulates expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LNCaP and WPMY-1 cells, and induces expression of a growth-suppressive phenotype, which inhibits proliferation of PCa cells by ps20-expressing WPMY-1 conditioned media. This growth suppression was subsequently shown to be dependent on COX-2 function.  Conclusions:   This work posits that expression of ps20 in the prostate stroma can regulate growth of epithelial and other tissues through the prostaglandin synthase pathway, and thereby restricts development and progression of neoplasms. This provides a rational for selective pressure against ps20 expression in tumour- associated stroma.""","""['Oliver J Hickman', 'Richard A Smith', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Sudha Narayana Rao', 'Soumya Nayak', 'Shubha Sreenivasan', 'Annapurna Vyakarnam', 'Christine Galustian']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Kallikrein-related peptidase-4 initiates tumor-stroma interactions in prostate cancer through protease-activated receptor-1.', 'Promotion of angiogenesis by ps20 in the differential reactive stroma prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Molecular analysis of WFDC1/ps20 gene in prostate cancer.', 'The WFDC1 gene: role in wound response and tissue homoeostasis.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'WFDC3 inhibits tumor metastasis by promoting the ERβ-mediated transcriptional repression of TGFBR1 in colorectal cancer.', 'WFDC Protein: A Promising Diagnosis Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Cathepsin-L and transglutaminase dependent processing of ps20: A novel mechanism for ps20 regulation via ECM cross-linking.', 'Downregulated microRNA-26a modulates prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting COX-2.']"""

Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived CXCL14 enhances tumour growth in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer. However, the prognostic significance of compartment-specific expression of CXCL14 has not been studied.  Methods:   CXCL14 mRNA expression was analysed in a breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours by the RNAscope 2.0 Assay. Epithelial and stromal expression was analysed separately and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival.  Results:   CXCL14 was variably and independently expressed in malignant and stromal cells of breast cancer. Total and stromal expression of CXCL14 did not associate with clinicopathological parameters. Epithelial CXCL14 expression was significantly associated with oestrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive tumours and lower proliferation status. Total CXCL14 expression correlated significantly with shorter breast cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival. High stromal, but not epithelial, CXCL14 expression was significantly associated with shorter survival in univariable and multivariable analyses. Moreover, the correlation between stromal CXCL14 expression and survival was more prominent in ER negative, triple negative and basal-like breast cancers.  Conclusions:   The identification of prognostic significance of stromal CXCL14 in breast cancer demonstrates novel clinical relevance of a stroma-derived secreted factor and illustrates the importance of tumour compartment-specific analyses.

Design:   A validated CaSR immunohistochemistry assay was performed on tumor tissue microarrays. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression and phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor status were previously assessed in a subset of cases by immunohistochemistry. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age and body mass index at diagnosis, Gleason grade, and pathological tumor node metastasis stage were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of CaSR expression with lethal prostate cancer.

Irreversible electroporation can ablate localized soft tissues. We describe 30 and 90-day complications and intermediate term functional outcomes in men undergoing prostate gland ablation using irreversible electroporation.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the charts of 25 patients with prostate cancer who underwent prostate gland ablation using irreversible electroporation as a primary procedure and who were followed for at least 6 months.  Results:   Median followup was 10.9 months. Grade 3 complications occurred in 2 patients including epididymitis (1) and urinary tract infection (1). Fourteen patients experienced grade 2 or lower complications, mainly transient urinary symptoms, hematuria and urinary tract infections. Of 25 patients 4 (16%) had cancer in the zone of ablation on routine followup biopsy at 6 months. Of those with normal urinary function at baseline 88% and 94% reported normal urinary function at 6 and 12 months after prostate gland ablation, respectively. By 12 months only 1 patient with normal erectile function at baseline reported new difficulty with potency and only 2 patients (8%) required a pad for urinary incontinence.  Conclusions:   Prostate gland ablation with irreversible electroporation is feasible and safe in selected men with localized prostate cancer. Intermediate term urinary and erectile function outcomes appear reasonable.

Here, the cis-effect of the SNPs on gene expression using expression quantitative trait loci analysis was investigated. The regulatory potential was screened in prostate tumors (n = 41) and in whole blood (n = 99). The results were validated in a second tumor set (n = 41), in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (n = 38), and using the GTEx Portal. The effects of haplotypes were analyzed in the whole blood. The high LD SNPs (rs143975731, rs12277366, rs2155225, and rs2155222) were associated with DGAT2 expression in both tumors sets (screening P = 0.035-0.043; validation P = 0.005-0.018). The PrCa death-associated alleles decreased the expression by two-fold. rs200331695 decreased DGAT2 expression in LCLs (P = 0.006).

Methods:   The study included 902 patients treated at the outpatient's department of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. A questionnaire included demographic-type questions and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (CSQ) designed to assess patient use of strategies of coping with pain.  Results:   The best results in six of the seven CSQ subscales were observed in the colorectal patient group. The lowest scores in all CSQ subscales were recorded in patients with prostate as the primary site. Results in individual patient groups were further juxtaposed with a chemotherapy variable. The only differences were found in the colorectal primary site patient group.  Conclusions:   A strategy the patient selects in order to cope with disease considerably mediates both pain sensation and the quality of patient life.

Objective:   To assess the use of prostate biopsy in men with limited life expectancy (LE) within the practices comprising the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC).  Design, setting, and participants:   MUSIC is a consortium of 42 practices and nearly 85% of the urologists in Michigan. From July 2013 to October 2014, clinical data were collected prospectively for all men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated comorbidity-adjusted LE in men aged ≥66 yr and identified men with <10 yr LE (limited LE) undergoing a first biopsy. Our LE calculator was not designed for men aged <66 yr; thus these men were excluded. Multivariable models estimated the proportion of all biopsies performed for men with limited LE in each MUSIC practice, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics. We also evaluated what treatments, if any, these patients received.  Results and limitations:   Among 3035 men aged ≥66 yr undergoing initial prostate biopsy, 60% had none of the measured comorbidities. Overall, 547 men (18%) had limited LE. Compared with men with a longer LE, these men had significantly higher prostate-specific antigen levels and abnormal digital rectal examination findings. The adjusted proportion of biopsies performed for men with limited LE ranged from 3.8% to 39% across MUSIC practices (p < 0.001). PCa was diagnosed in 69% of men with limited LE; among this group, 74% received any active treatment. Of these men, 46% had high-grade cancer (Gleason score 8-10).  Conclusions:   Among a large and diverse group of urology practices, nearly 20% of prostate biopsies are performed in men with limited LE. These data provide useful context for quality improvement efforts aimed at optimizing patient selection for prostate biopsy.  Patient summary:   In this report, nearly 2 of every 10 men undergoing prostate biopsy had a life expectancy (LE) <10 yr. Implementing LE calculators in clinical practice may help refine patient selection for prostate biopsy.""","""['Firas Abdollah', 'Zaojun Ye', 'David C Miller', 'Susan M Linsell', 'James E Montie', 'James O Peabody', 'Khurshid R Ghani;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Understanding the Use of Prostate Biopsy among Men with Limited Life Expectancy in a Statewide Quality Improvement Collaborative.', 'Predicting Biopsy Outcomes During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Risk Calculators in Five Large Active Surveillance Cohorts.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators for Shared Decision Making Across Diverse Urology Practices in Michigan.', 'Variation in prostate cancer detection rates in a statewide quality improvement collaborative.', 'Predicting Life Expectancy in Men Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Exploring Variation in the Receipt of Recommended Active Surveillance for Men with Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Using an Automated Electronic Health Record Score To Estimate Life Expectancy In Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer In The Veterans Health Administration.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of Raman spectroscopy for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Improving quality through clinical registries in urology.']"""

However, radium-223 decays to form α-particles with very short path lengths that may not reach the epidural space. Herein, we investigate the impact of baseline spinal epidural disease on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated with radium-223.  Methods:   Between October 2013 to December 2014, 41 consecutive mCRPC patients at a large tertiary cancer center were prescribed radium-223 as part of standard of care. 29% of patients had pre-treatment epidural disease (posMRI), 27% had no epidural disease (negMRI), and 44% did not have a baseline MRI (noMRI). All patients had post-treatment spinal imaging. Actuarial survival times were calculated for overall survival (OS), spinal axis radiographic progression-free survival (spinePFS) and epidural progression-free survival (epiPFS) from time of first radium-223 treatment.  Results:   For patients with posMRI (n=12), noMRI (n=18) and negMRI (n=11) cumulative rates of development or worsening of epidural disease and/or high-grade cord compression at time of last follow-up were 83%, 44% and 9%, respectively (P=0.001). For the posMRI, noMRI and negMRI groups the median OS was 6.3 months, 12.6 months and not reached (P=0.01), the median spinePFS was 3.2 months, 4.8 months and not reached (P=0.01), and the median epiPFS was 3.2 months, 10.4 months and not reached (P=0.001). Completing less than six cycles of radium-223 was significantly associated with worse OS (P<0.0001), spinePFS (P=0.007) and epiPFS (P=0.01). Greater than or equal to twenty osseous lesions pre-treatment was significantly associated with worse spinePFS (P=0.001) and epiPFS (P=0.03).  Conclusions:   In a heavily pre-treated small cohort, patients with baseline epidural disease frequently progressed to spinal cord compression and early cessation of radium-223 therapy.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) could prevent or delay the development of skeleton-related events (SREs). The present study aimed to identify the clinical features of and treatment strategies for Chinese patients with bone metastases.  Methods:   Consecutive cancer patients who had bone metastases and received BP treatment were enrolled. A questionnaire was developed to collect the patients' clinical data, as well as information on the diagnosis and management of bone metastases. Physicians' awareness of the guidelines and knowledge of the application of BP were also assessed.  Results:   A total of 3223 patients with lung cancer (36.5%), breast cancer (30.9%), prostate cancer (8.5%), and gastrointestinal cancer (5.7%) were included in this study. The sites of bone metastases were the thoracic spine (56.0 %), lumbar spine (47.1%), ribs (32.6%), and pelvis (23.2%). The SRE frequency was the highest in patients with multiple myeloma (36.6%), followed by those with lung cancer (25.9%), breast cancer (20.2%), prostate cancer (18.2%), and gastrointestinal cancer (17.3%). Irradiation to the bone was the most frequent SRE (58% in lung cancer patients, 45% in breast cancer patients, and 48% in prostate cancer patients). Our survey also showed that 45.5% of patients received BP within 3 months after their diagnosis of bone metastases, whereas the remaining 54.5% of patients did not receive BP treatment until at least 3 months after their diagnosis of bone metastases. The SRE frequency in the former group was significantly lower than that in the latter group (4.0% vs. 42.3%, P < 0.05). In patients with more than 6 months of continuous BP treatment, the mean time to the first SRE was significantly longer than that in patients with less than 6 months of continuous BP treatment (7.2 vs. 3.4 months, P < 0.05). In addition, 12.2% of the physicians were not aware of the efficacy of BP in preventing and delaying SRE. Only half (52.3%) of the physicians agreed that the BP treatment should persist for at least 6 months unless it was intolerable.  Conclusions:   Our study suggested that prompt and persistent BP treatment was associated with a reduced risk of SREs. However, our survey also revealed that the proper application of BP was not as common as expected in China.""","""['Yunpeng Yang', 'Yuxiang Ma', 'Jin Sheng', 'Yan Huang', 'Yuanyuan Zhao', 'Wenfeng Fang', 'Shaodong Hong', 'Ying Tian', 'Cong Xue', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chin J Cancer""","""['Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Clinical features and prognosis in 104 colorectal cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Retrospective database analysis of the effect of zoledronic acid on skeletal-related events and mortality in women with breast cancer and bone metastasis in a managed care plan.', 'Optimal management of metastatic bone disease.', 'Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when?', 'N6-Methyladenosine Modification of ANLN Enhances Hepatocellular Carcinoma Bone Metastasis.', 'Risk factors associated with skeletal-related events following discontinuation of denosumab treatment among patients with bone metastases from solid tumors: A real-world machine learning approach.', 'CT-guided cryoablation for management of bone metastases: a single center experience and review of the literature.', 'Prognostic factors and survival prediction in HER2-positive breast cancer with bone metastases: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Clinical features and outcomes of metastatic bone tumors of the pelvis.']"""

In this study, we investigated a role of cell-cell contact-related molecules (protein ECM components, proteoglycans (PGs) and junction-related molecules) in intercellular communications between the human TERT immortalized fibroblasts (BjTERT fibroblasts) and normal (PNT2) or cancer (LNCaP, PC3, DU145) prostate epithelial cells. It was shown that BjTERT-PNT2 cell coculture resulted in significant decrease of both BjTERT and PNT2 proliferation rates and reorganization of transcriptional activity of cell-cell contact-related genes in both cell types. Immunocytochemical staining revealed redistribution of DCN and LUM in PNT2 cells and significant increase of SDC1 at the intercellular contact zones between BjTERT and PNT2 cells, suggesting active involvement of the PGs in cell-cell contacts and contact inhibition of cell proliferation. Unlike to PNT2 cells, PC3 cells did not respond to BjTERT in terms of PGs expression, moderately increased transcriptional activity of junctions-related genes (especially tight junction) and failed to establish PC3-BjTERT contacts. At the same time, PC3 cells significantly down-regulated junctions-related genes (especially focal adhesions and adherens junctions) in BjTERT fibroblasts resulting in visible preference for homotypic PC3-PC3 over heterotypic PC3-BjTERT contacts and autonomous growth of PC3 clones. Taken together, the results demonstrate that an instructing role of fibroblasts to normal prostate epithelial cells is revoked by cancer cells through deregulation of proteoglycans and junction molecules expression and overall disorganization of fibroblast-cancer cell communication.""","""['Anastasia V Suhovskih', 'Vladimir I Kashuba', 'George Klein', 'Elvira V Grigorieva']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Adh Migr""","""['Fibroblast and prostate tumor cell cross-talk: fibroblast differentiation, TGF-β, and extracellular matrix down-regulation.', 'Tissue-specificity of heparan sulfate biosynthetic machinery in cancer.', 'Mineralized human primary osteoblast matrices as a model system to analyse interactions of prostate cancer cells with the bone microenvironment.', 'Fibroblasts are critical determinants in prostatic cancer growth and dissemination.', 'Proteoglycans: master modulators of paracrine fibroblast-carcinoma cell interactions.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Biological and Clinical Aspects of Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'Patterns of indolence in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Inhibition of glypican-1 expression induces an activated fibroblast phenotype in a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell-line.', 'Proteoglycans in the Pathogenesis of Hormone-Dependent Cancers: Mediators and Effectors.']"""

A cross-sectional survey of 331 patients from a population-based sample who were in the first year after diagnosis (M = 9.6, SD = 1.9) was conducted to assess sources of support, unmet supportive care needs, domain-specific quality of life and psychological distress. Overall, 82% of men reported unmet supportive care needs. The top five needs were sexuality (58%); prostate cancer-specific (57%); psychological (47%); physical and daily living (41%); and health system and information (31%). Professional support was most often sought from doctors (51%). Across most domains, men who were older (Ps ≤ 0.03), less well educated (Ps ≤ 0.04) and more depressed (Ps ≤ 0.05) were less likely to seek help for unmet needs. Greater sexual help-seeking was related to better sexual function (P = 0.03), higher education (P ≤ 0.03) and less depression (P = 0.05). Unmet supportive care needs are highly prevalent after localised prostate cancer diagnosis with older age, lower education and higher depression apparent barriers to help-seeking.

Here, we investigate the frequency and clinical significance of extraskeletal findings among 130 consecutive patients undergoing F-NaF PET/CT for osseous metastatic disease.  Methods:   F-NaF PET/CT performed on 130 patients (101 men and 29 women; mean age: 61.4 years) with biopsy-proven malignancies were reviewed independently. Incidental soft tissue findings detected on unenhanced low-dose CT portions of the scans were compiled and categorized by clinical significance.  Results:   A total of 275 incidental extraskeletal CT findings were observed in 114 out of 130 patients (87.7%). Seven patients (5.4%) showed clinically significant findings. One patient developed new lung nodules that were resected and proven to be metastases. Two patients showed new hypodense hepatic lesions that were highly suspicious for liver metastases. One patient with prostate cancer was found to have previously unknown retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Three patients showed indeterminate renal and adrenal lesions that necessitated further correlative imaging.  Conclusion:   Although CT indicated a large number of incidental extraskeletal lesions in the majority of patients undergoing F-NaF PET/CT, clinically significant incidental findings requiring further evaluation were relatively infrequently observed in 5.4% of patients. Thus, the low-dose unenhanced CT in F-NaF PET/CT performed for oncologic evaluation may indicate unexpected soft tissue lesions that can impact patient management and therefore should be interpreted by physicians skilled in CT reading, with correlation to available imaging, and familiar with established guidelines for work-up of incidental findings.""","""['H Henry Guo', 'Farshad Moradi', 'Andrei Iagaru']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['A Prospective Comparison of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A Prospective Study Comparing 99mTc-Hydroxyethylene-Diphosphonate Planar Bone Scintigraphy and Whole-Body SPECT/CT with 18F-Fluoride PET/CT and 18F-Fluoride PET/MRI for Diagnosing Bone Metastases.', 'Prospective Comparison of 99mTc-MDP Scintigraphy, Combined 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG PET/CT, and Whole-Body MRI in Patients with Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases with 18F-NaF and 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT.', 'The Role of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Bone Scans in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Bone Disease from Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Incidental Findings on 18 F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for Parathyroid Imaging.', 'Incidental extra-cardiac findings on 13NH3 myocardial perfusion PET/CT.']"""

Methods:   Male participants in the Veterans Affairs RA registry were followed up from the time of enrollment until death or December 2013. Cytokines and chemokines were measured in banked serum obtained at the time of enrollment, using a bead-based multiplex assay, and a previously developed cytokine score was calculated. Vital status and cause of death were determined through the National Death Index. Associations of cytokines with cancer mortality were examined using multivariable competing-risks regression.  Results:   Among 1,190 men with RA, 60 cancer deaths (30 of which were attributable to lung cancer) occurred over 5,307 patient-years of follow-up. The patients had a mean age of 64.5 years, had established disease (median duration 8.7 years), were seropositive for rheumatoid factor (81%) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (77%), and frequently had a history of smoking (82% current or former). Seven of 17 analytes examined were individually associated with cancer mortality. The cytokine score was associated with overall cancer (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.08-1.85) and lung cancer (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.57-2.19) mortality in multivariable analyses. Those in the highest quartile of cytokine scores had a >2-fold increased risk of overall cancer mortality (P = 0.039) and a 6-fold increased risk of lung cancer mortality (P = 0.028) relative to the lowest quartile.

To test the hypothesis that the potentially injurious effect of pelvic irradiation can be counterbalanced by reduced irradiated normal tissue volume using IG-IMRT.  Methods:   Between February 2010 and February 2012, 208 patients with prostate cancer were treated with adjuvant or salvage IG-IMRT to the PB (102 patients, Group PB) or the pelvis and prostate bed (P) (106 patients, Group P). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria were used to evaluate toxicity.  Results:   Median follow-up was 27 months. Toxicity G ≥ 2 in Group PB: in the bowel acute and late toxicities were 11.8% and 10%, respectively; urinary acute and late toxicities were 10.8% and 15%, respectively. Toxicity G ≥ 2 in Group P: in the bowel acute and late toxicities were both 13.2%; urinary acute and late toxicities were 13.2% and 15.1%, respectively. No statistical difference in acute or late toxicity between the groups was found (bowel: p = 0.23 and p = 0.89 for acute and late toxicity, respectively; urinary: p = 0.39 and p = 0.66 for acute and late toxicity, respectively). Of the clinical variables, only previous abdominal surgery was correlated with acute bowel toxicity. Dosimetric parameters that correlated with bowel toxicity were identified.  Conclusion:   The toxicity rates were low and similar in both groups, suggesting that IG-IMRT allows for a safe post-operative irradiation of larger volumes.

In this study, we compared miRNA expression patterns in 65 pairs of prostate cancer and para-cancer tissues by RNA sequencing and found that miR-182-5p was the most up-regulated miRNA in prostate cancer tissues. The result was validated using realtime PCR in 18 pairs of prostate cancer and para-cancer tissues. In in vitro analysis, it was confirmed that miR-182-5p promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration and inhibit apoptosis. In addition, the androgen receptor directly regulated the transcription of miR-182-5p, which could target to the 3'UTR of ARRDC3 mRNA and affect the expression of ARRDC3 and its downstream gene ITGB4. For the in vivo experiment, miR-182-5p overexpression also promoted the growth and progression of prostate cancer tumors.

Overexpression of the ERG transcription factor is observed in half of all prostate tumors and is an underlying cause of this disease. However, the mechanisms involved in the functions of ERG are still not fully understood. In the present study, we showed that ERG can directly bind to KDM4A (also known as JMJD2A), a histone demethylase that particularly demethylates lysine 9 on histone H3. ERG and KDM4A cooperated in upregulating the promoter of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a downstream effector in the Hippo signaling pathway and crucial growth regulator. Multiple ERG binding sites within the human YAP1 gene promoter were identified and their impact on transcription was determined through mutational analysis. Furthermore, we found that ERG expression reduced histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at the YAP1 gene promoter, consistent with its epigenetic regulation through the ERG interaction partner, KDM4A. Finally, downregulation of YAP1 phenocopied the growth-retarding effect of ERG or KDM4A depletion in human VCaP prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these results elucidated a novel mechanism - ERG promotes prostate tumorigenesis together with KDM4A through the upregulation of YAP1.

These micro-RNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate cell invasion and inhibit the expression of FOXM1 and CENPF, two master regulators of metastasis in PCa. Interestingly, the repression of FOXM1 and CENPF by these miRNAs occurs through COUP-TFII, a member of the orphan nuclear receptors family. Loss of miR-101 positively correlates with the increase of COUP-TFII-FOXM1-CENPF activity in clinical PCa data sets, implicating clinical relevance of such regulation. Further studies show that COUP-TFII is a critical factor controlling metastatic gene networks to promote PCa metastasis.

However, the function of RHOC in cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), a highly recurrent and metastatic carcinoma with poor prognosis, remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of RHOC in CCC tumor progression. RHOC expression levels were examined in CCC tissues and cells, and adjacent nontumorous bile duct tissues. The effects and molecular mechanisms of RHOC expression on cell migration and invasion were also investigated. The current study demonstrated that RHOC protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCC specimens and CCC cell lines.

In the present study, immune-fluorescent staining, siRNAs, qRT-PC, immunoblotting, cell migration and invasion assays were carried out to test typical epithelial to mesenchymal transition under hypoxia and the key regulators of this process in PC3, a human prostate cancer cell line.

Prostate cancer (PCa) cells express moderately higher level of cytoplasmic TBLR1 compared to benign prostate cells. When comparing androgen-dependent (AD) to androgen-independent (AI) PCa, AI cells contain very high levels of TBLR1 cytoplasmic expression and low levels of nuclear expression. Overexpression of cytoplasmic TBLR1 in AD cells inhibits apoptosis induced by androgen deprivation therapy, either in an androgen free condition or in the presence of bicalutamide.

As molecules of highly lipidic character found in the circulatory system, cPAs are bound and transported by the main extracellular lipid binding protein-serum albumin. Here, we present the detailed interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and equine serum albumin (ESA) with a derivative of cPA, 1-O-myristoyl-sn-glycerol-2,3-cyclic phosphorodithioate (Myr-2S-cPA). Initial selection of the ligand used for the structural study was made by the analysis of the therapeutically promising properties of the sulfur containing analogues of cPA in respect to the unmodified lysophospholipids (LPLs). Substitution of one or two non-bridging oxygen atoms in the phosphate group with one or two sulfur atoms increases the cytotoxic effect of cPAs up to 60% on the human prostate cancer (PC) cells. Myr-2S-cPA reduces cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 value of 29.0 μM after 24 h incubation, which is almost 30% lower than IC50 of single substituted phosphorothioate cPA. Although, the structural homology between HSA and ESA is big, their crystal complexes with Myr-2S-cPA demonstrate significantly different mode of binding of this LPL analogue. HSA binds three molecules of Myr-2S-cPA, whereas ESA only one.

Transducin β-like protein (TBL1) and Transducin β-like 1X-linked receptor 1 (TBLR1) have been identified recently as a coactivator for NF-κB-mediated transcription; however, the underlying mechanism by which TBL1 and TBLR1 activate NF-κB function during inflammation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that cytokine production is significantly elevated in androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells compared with androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Elevated cytokine production positively correlates with the TBL1 and TBLR1 SUMOylation level in PC-3 cells. We show that both TBL1 and TBLR1 are SUMOylated in response to TNF-α treatment, and this increases formation of the TBL1-TBLR1-NF-κB complex, which leads to NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation of cytokine gene expression. Conversely, SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation of TBL1 and TBLR1 inhibits NF-κB-target gene expression by dissociating TBL1 and TBLR1 from the nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex. TBL1 knockdown substantially suppresses inflammatory signaling and PC-3 cell proliferation.

We conducted a case-control study comprising 116 patients with gastric cancer as well as 102 sex- and age-matched controls and confirmed that the SNPs MUC1 (mucin 1) rs9841504 and ZBTB20 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 20) rs4072037 were associated with an increased gastric cancer risk. Of the 116 patients diagnosed with cancer, 65 had at least 1 direct lineal relative with carcinoma of the digestive system or breast/ovarian cancer. These 65 had another 4 SNPs associated with gastric cancer susceptibility: PSCA (prostate stem cell antigen) rs2294008, PLCE1 (phospholipase C epsilon 1) rs2274223, PTGER4/PRKAA1 (prostaglandin E receptor 4/ protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1) rs13361707, and TYMS (thymidylate synthetase) rs2790. However, each of these low-penetrance susceptibility polymorphisms alone is not considered influential enough to predict the absolute risk of early-onset gastric cancer. Thus we decided to study different combinations of polygenes as they affected for our population. Those subjects with both the risk alleles MUC1 rs9841504 and ZBTB20 rs4072037 had a greater than 3-fold increased risk of gastric cancer. Also those with a hereditary background including the risk alleles PLCE1 rs2274223 and PTGER4/PRKAA1 rs13361707 were 3 times more susceptible to cardia cancer than those without. These findings show that the study of combined polymorphisms, instead of single low-penetrance variations in susceptibility, may lead to a high-risk classification for a specific population.""","""['Jiajia Yuan', 'Yanyan Li', 'Tiantian Tian', 'Na Li', 'Yan Zhu', 'Jianling Zou', 'Jing Gao', 'Lin Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Genetic variations in the PRKAA1 and ZBTB20 genes and gastric cancer susceptibility in a Korean population.', 'Associations of genetic variants in the PSCA, MUC1 and PLCE1 genes with stomach cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.', 'PSCA and MUC1 gene polymorphisms are associated with gastric cancer and pre-malignant gastric conditions corrected.', 'Genetic variation and gastric cancer risk: a field synopsis and meta-analysis.', 'Association between PRKAA1 rs13361707 T>C polymorphism and gastric cancer risk: Evidence based on a meta-analysis.', 'Lifestyles, genetics, and future perspectives on gastric cancer in east Asian populations.', 'Gastric Cancer Risk Prediction Using an Epidemiological Risk Assessment Model and Polygenic Risk Score.', 'Clinicopathologic Characteristics and Risk Factors of Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Early Gastric Cancer in the Wannan Region.', 'PLCE1 Polymorphisms and Risk of Esophageal and Gastric Cancer in a Northwestern Chinese Population.', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in PLCE1 for Cancer Risk of Different Types: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is upregulated in various malignancies and promotes apoptotic resistance. We evaluated the efficacy and mechanisms of the first described synthetic cell-penetrating inhibitor of ATF5 function, CP-d/n-ATF5-S1.  Experimental design:   Preclinical drug testing was performed in various treatment-resistant cancer cells and in vivo xenograft models.  Results:   CP-d/n-ATF5-S1 reduced the transcript levels of several known direct ATF5 targets. It depleted endogenous ATF5 and induced apoptosis across a broad panel of treatment-refractory cancer cell lines, sparing non-neoplastic cells. CP-d/n-ATF5-S1 promoted tumor cell apoptotic susceptibility in part by reducing expression of the deubiquitinase Usp9X and led to diminished levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. In line with this, CP-d/n-ATF5-S1 synergistically enhanced tumor cell apoptosis induced by the BH3-mimetic ABT263 and the death ligand TRAIL. In vivo, CP-d/n-ATF5-S1 attenuated tumor growth as a single compound in glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, and triple receptor-negative breast cancer xenograft models. Finally, the combination treatment of CP-d/n-ATF5-S1 and ABT263 significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo more efficiently than each reagent on its own.  Conclusions:   Our data support the idea that CP-d/n-ATF5-S1, administered as a single reagent or in combination with other drugs, holds promise as an innovative, safe, and efficient antineoplastic agent against treatment-resistant cancers.

We show that the polypeptide-based K60L20 gold nanoshells have low toxicity in the absence of laser exposure, significant heat generation upon exposure to near-infrared light, and, as a result, localized cytotoxicity within the region of laser irradiation in vitro. To gain a better understanding of our gold nanoshells in the context of photothermal therapy, we developed a comprehensive mathematical model for heat transfer and experimentally validated this model by predicting the temperature as a function of time and position in our experimental setup. This model can be used to predict which parameters of our gold nanoshells can be manipulated to improve heat generation for tumor destruction.

Here, we investigated the molecular association between AKT activation and the function of death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) in CaP. An inverse correlation of pAKT and DAPK3 expression was seen in a panel of CaP cell lines. Inhibition of AKT by wortmannin/LY294002 or overexpression of DAPK3 reverts the proliferative function of AKT in CaP cells. On the other hand, ectopic expression of AKT inhibited DAPK3 function and induced proliferation of CaP cells. In addition, AKT over-expressed tumors exhibit aggressive growth when compared to control vector in xenograft models. The immunohistochemistry results revealed a down-regulation of DAPK3 expression in AKT over-expressed tumors as compared to control tumors. Finally, we examined the expression pattern of AKT and DAPK3 in human CaP specimens - the expected gradual increase and nuclear localization of pAKT was seen in higher Gleason score samples versus benign hyperplasia (BPH). On the contrary, reduced expression of DAPK3 was seen in higher Gleason stages versus BPH. This suggests that inhibition of DAPK3 may be a contributing factor to the carcinogenesis of the prostate. Understanding the mechanism by which AKT negatively regulates DAPK3 function may suggest whether DAPK3 can be a therapeutic target for CaP.""","""['Trinath P Das', 'Suman Suman', 'A M Sashi Papu John', 'Deeksha Pal', 'Angelena Edwards', 'Houda Alatassi', 'Murali K Ankem', 'Chendil Damodaran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Death-associated protein kinase 3 controls the tumor progression of A549 cells through ERK MAPK/c-Myc signaling.', 'Anacardic acid induces cell apoptosis of prostatic cancer through autophagy by ER stress/DAPK3/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition of AKT promotes FOXO3a-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) family modulators: Current and future therapeutic outcomes.', 'Orange is the new black: Kinases are the new master regulators of tumor suppression.', 'How the Innate Immune DNA Sensing cGAS-STING Pathway Is Involved in Apoptosis.', 'Regulatory Non-coding RNAs for Death Associated Protein Kinase Family.', 'ZIPK activates the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway and promotes cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells.', 'Network analysis identifies DAPK3 as a potential biomarker for lymphatic invasion and colon adenocarcinoma prognosis.', 'DAPK3 inhibits gastric cancer progression via activation of ULK1-dependent autophagy.']"""

Methods:   Ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiogram, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positive emission tomography, CSF analysis, serologies, tissue pathology with immunohistochemistry, and examination of relevant literature.  Results:   A 76-year-old man with a history of prostate adenocarcinoma was referred for 2 months of unilateral blurry vision. Fundus examination revealed elevated deep orange choroidal lesions in the macula with overlying retinal pigment epithelium mottling and subretinal fluid. Fluorescein angiogram demonstrated alternating areas of hypofluorescence and hyperfluorescence (staining) without leakage. Optical coherence tomography revealed dome-shaped and lumpy choroidal lesions with surrounding undulating ""lumpy bumpy"" and ""rippled/seasick"" patterns. Workup for a primary or additional metastatic lesion including computerized tomography of head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging brain, and whole-body positive emission tomography scan was negative. Full-thickness excisional chorioretinal biopsy was obtained through pars plana vitrectomy with diathermy and vertical scissors. Histologic examination revealed adenocarcinoma with weak positive staining for prostate specific antigen, moderate positive staining for P501S (prostein), and strong positive staining for prostatic acid phosphatase, consistent with metastasis from a prostate primary. Treatment consisted of local radiation with regression of the metastatic tumor. The patient is also on concomitant androgen deprivation treatment because there is a very high incidence of systemic recurrence due to hematogenous involvement. The patient's vision has continued to improve 6 months past treatment.  Conclusion:   The authors present a unique case to highlight the multimodal imaging and histology of a rare presentation of biopsy-proven, isolated metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma to the choroid. Systemic workup is required, and if unrevealing of a primary or metastatic lesion, full-thickness chorioretinal biopsy and histopathology can provide a definitive diagnosis, allowing optimal treatment.

Patients and methods:   We compared 70 patients who underwent RRP with the urethral-fixation technique with a contemporary control group of 51 patients who received RRP with a standard urethrovesical anastomosis. In the urethral-fixation group, the urethrovesical anastomosis was made using eight single sutures. Specifically, to avoid retraction and/or deviations, we fixed the urethral stump laterally to the medial portion of levator ani muscle. Also, to maintain the normal position in the context of the pelvic floor, we fixed the urethral sphincter deeper to the medial dorsal raphe using a 3-0 polydioxanone suture at the 6 o'clock position before completing the incision of the urethral wall. Urinary continence recovery was evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after catheter removal. Patients self-reporting no urine leak were considered continent. Uni- and multivariable analyses were used to identify predictors of urinary incontinence at the different follow-up time-points.  Results:   The evaluated groups had comparable preoperative variables. At 1 week after catheter removal, 32 (45.7%) patients in the urethral-fixation group and 10 (19.6%) in the control group were continent (P = 0.01). At 4 weeks after catheter removal, 46 (65.7%) patients in the urethral-fixation group and 16 (31.4%) in the control group were continent (P = 0.001). At 8 weeks after catheter removal, 59 (84.3%) patients in the urethral-fixation group and 21 (41.2%) in the control group were continent (P < 0.001). Finally, at 12 weeks after catheter removal, 63 (90%) patients in the urethral-fixation group and 32 (62.7%) in the control group were continent (P = 0.001). The urethral-fixation technique was an independent predictor of urinary continence recovery at 1 week [odds ratio (OR) 4.305; P = 0.002); 4 weeks (OR 4.784; P < 0.001); 8 weeks (OR 7.678; P < 0.001) and 12 weeks (OR 5.152; P = 0.001) after catheter removal.

The difficulty in organizing and mining this unprecedented amount of information has stimulated the development of computational methods designed to infer the underlying structure of regulatory networks from observational data. These important developments had a profound impact in biological sciences since they triggered the development of a novel data-driven investigative approach. In cancer research, this strategy has been particularly successful. It has contributed to the identification of novel biomarkers, to a better characterization of disease heterogeneity and to a more in depth understanding of cancer pathophysiology. However, so far these approaches have not explicitly addressed the challenge of identifying networks representing the interaction of different cell types in a complex tissue. Since these interactions represent an essential part of the biology of both diseased and healthy tissues, it is of paramount importance that this challenge is addressed. Here we report the definition of a network reverse engineering strategy designed to infer directional signals linking adjacent cell types within a complex tissue. The application of this inference strategy to prostate cancer genome-wide expression profiling data validated the approach and revealed that normal epithelial cells exert an anti-tumour activity on prostate carcinoma cells. Moreover, by using a Bayesian hierarchical model integrating genetics and gene expression data and combining this with survival analysis, we show that the expression of putative cell communication genes related to focal adhesion and secretion is affected by epistatic gene copy number variation and it is predictive of patient survival. Ultimately, this study represents a generalizable approach to the challenge of deciphering cell communication networks in a wide spectrum of biological systems.""","""['Victor Trevino', 'Alberto Cassese', 'Zsuzsanna Nagy', 'Xiaodong Zhuang', 'John Herbert', 'Philipp Antczak', 'Kim Clarke', 'Nicholas Davies', 'Ayesha Rahman', 'Moray J Campbell', 'Michele Guindani', 'Roy Bicknell', 'Marina Vannucci', 'Francesco Falciani']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Correction: A Network Biology Approach Identifies Molecular Cross-Talk between Normal Prostate Epithelial and Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Analysis of normal-tumour tissue interaction in tumours: prediction of prostate cancer features from the molecular profile of adjacent normal cells.', 'Computational Reconstruction of NFκB Pathway Interaction Mechanisms during Prostate Cancer.', 'Constructing Bayesian networks by integrating gene expression and copy number data identifies NLGN4Y as a novel regulator of prostate cancer progression.', 'Integrating biomedical knowledge to model pathways of prostate cancer progression.', 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'Module-detection approaches for the integration of multilevel omics data highlight the comprehensive response of Aspergillus fumigatus to caspofungin.', 'High miR-205 expression in normal epithelium is associated with biochemical failure - an argument for epithelial crosstalk in prostate cancer?', 'Omics Approaches to Identify Potential Biomarkers of Inflammatory Diseases in the Focal Adhesion Complex.', 'Correction: A Network Biology Approach Identifies Molecular Cross-Talk between Normal Prostate Epithelial and Prostate Carcinoma Cells.']"""

These risk assessments should be supported and supplemented by objective methods for identifying patients at increased risk of recurrence. Markers of epigenetic aberrations have shown promising results in several cancer types and can be assessed by automatic analysis of chromatin organisation in tumour cell nuclei.  Methods:   A consecutive series of 317 prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy at a national hospital between 1987 and 2005 were followed for a median of 10 years (interquartile range, 7-14). On average three tumour block samples from each patient were included to account for tumour heterogeneity. We developed a novel marker, termed Nucleotyping, based on automatic assessment of disordered chromatin organisation, and validated its ability to predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Nucleotyping predicted recurrence with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1-5.1). With adjustment for clinical and pathological characteristics, the HR was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5-4.1). An updated stratification into three risk groups significantly improved the concordance with patient outcome compared with a state-of-the-art risk-stratification tool (P<0.001).

The method enables whole-body estimates of global Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (gADC) and total Diffusion Volume (tDV), both of which have demonstrated considerable utility for assessing treatment response in patients with bone metastases from primary prostate and breast cancers. Here we investigate the agreement (inter-observer repeatability) between two radiologists in their definition of Volumes Of Interest (VOIs) and subsequent assessment of tDV and gADC on an exploratory patient cohort of nine. Furthermore, each radiologist was asked to repeat his or her measurements on the same patient data sets one month later to identify the intra-observer repeatability of the technique. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method provided full posterior probabilities of repeatability measures along with maximum a-posteriori values and 95% confidence intervals. Our estimates of the inter-observer Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICCinter) for log-tDV and median gADC were 1.00 (0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (0.89-0.99) respectively, indicating excellent observer agreement for these metrics. Mean gADC values were found to have ICCinter = 0.97 (0.81-0.99) indicating a slight sensitivity to outliers in the derived distributions of gADC. Of the higher order gADC statistics, skewness was demonstrated to have good inter-user agreement with ICCinter = 0.99 (0.86-1.00), whereas gADC variance and kurtosis performed relatively poorly: 0.89 (0.39-0.97) and 0.96 (0.69-0.99) respectively. Estimates of intra-observer repeatability (ICCintra) demonstrated similar results: 0.99 (0.95-1.00) for log-tDV, 0.98 (0.89-0.99) and 0.97 (0.83-0.99) for median and mean gADC respectively, 0.64 (0.25-0.88) for gADC variance, 0.85 (0.57-0.95) for gADC skewness and 0.85 (0.57-0.95) for gADC kurtosis. Further investigation of two anomalous patient cases revealed that a very small proportion of voxels with outlying gADC values lead to instability in higher order gADC statistics. We therefore conclude that estimates of median/mean gADC and tumour volume demonstrate excellent inter- and intra-observer repeatability whilst higher order statistics of gADC should be used with caution when ascribing significance to clinical changes.""","""['Matthew D Blackledge', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Matthew R Orton', 'Anwar R Padhani', 'David J Collins', 'Martin O Leach', 'Dow-Mu Koh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Whole-body MRI: detecting bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in lymphoma-comparison of global apparent diffusion coefficient histogram parameters for differentiation of diseased nodes of lymphoma patients from normal lymph nodes of healthy individuals.', 'Assessment of treatment response by total tumor volume and global apparent diffusion coefficient using diffusion-weighted MRI in patients with metastatic bone disease: a feasibility study.', 'Assessment and quantification of sources of variability in breast apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements at diffusion weighted imaging.', 'Quantitative Whole-Body Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging.', 'Early Response to Chemotherapy in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Evaluated Using Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Initial Observations.', 'Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI of normal lymph nodes: prospective apparent diffusion coefficient histogram and nodal distribution analysis in a healthy cohort.', 'Whole-body MRI: detecting bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'Imaging of treatment response and minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma: state of the art WB-MRI and PET/CT.', 'Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI in lymphoma-comparison of global apparent diffusion coefficient histogram parameters for differentiation of diseased nodes of lymphoma patients from normal lymph nodes of healthy individuals.']"""

The mechanisms underlying these epidemiological observations are poorly understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical initial step and a hallmark for cancer metastasis. In the present study, the relationship between simvastatin and EMT in PCa and the mechanism involved was investigated. It was demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited the EMT as assessed by reduced expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, and increased E-cadherin in TGF-β1 treated DU145 PCa cells. Furthermore, simvastatin inhibited TGF-β1-induced migration and invasion of DU145 cells. The TGF-β1/Smad pathway and non-Smad pathway were investigated in simvastatin-treated DU145 cells. Simvastatin had no effect on TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. In the non-Smad pathway, simvastatin reduced TGF-β1-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but had no effect on TGF-β1-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Simvastatin attenuated TGF-β1-induced EMT, cell migration and invasion in DU145 cells. These effects may have been mediated by the inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, not through the canonical Smad pathway.

The PC-3 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with various doses of bortezomib, irinotecan, etoposide or their combinations. The growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects were determined by water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or iCELLigence system. The combination index values were determined by the Chou-Talalay method. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of bortezomib on the PC-3 cell line was determined to be 53.4 nM by WST-1 assay, whereas the IC50 values of irinotecan and etoposide were determined to be 2.1 and 26.5 µM, respectively. These results suggest that the 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is more potent, compared with irinotecan and etoposide, in the androgen-insensitive and tumor protein p53-null cell line PC-3. The combined effects of bortezomib+irinotecan and bortezomib+etoposide were also tested on PC-3 cells. The effect of bortezomib+irinotecan combination was not significantly different than that produced by either monotherapy, according to the results of iCELLigence system and MTT assay.

In this study, we manually carried out the mining of the full text of proteomics literature that involved comparisons between PCa and normal or benign tissue and identified 41 differentially expressed proteins verified or reported more than 2 times from different research studies. We regarded these proteins as seed proteins to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The extended network included one giant network, which consisted of 1,264 nodes connected via 1,744 edges, and 3 small separate components. The backbone network was then constructed, which was derived from key nodes and the subnetwork consisting of the shortest path between seed proteins. Topological analyses of these networks were conducted to identify proteins essential for the genesis of PCa. Solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 4 (SLC2A4) had the highest closeness centrality located in the center of each network, and the highest betweenness centrality and largest degree in the backbone network. Tubulin, beta 2C (TUBB2C) had the largest degree in the giant network and subnetwork. In addition, using module analysis of the whole PPI network, we obtained a densely connected region. Functional annotation indicated that the Ras protein signal transduction biological process, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), neurotrophin and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway may play an important role in the genesis and development of PCa.

The presence or absence of epigenetic aberrations, more specifically DNA-methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC in histopathologically negative prostate core biopsies has resulted in an increased negative predictive value (NPV) of ∼90% and thus could lead to a reduction of unnecessary repeat biopsies. Here, it is investigated whether, in methylation-positive men, DNA-methylation intensities could help to identify those men harboring high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) PCa, resulting in an improved positive predictive value.  Methods:   Two cohorts, consisting of men with histopathologically negative index biopsies, followed by a positive or negative repeat biopsy, were combined. EpiScore, a methylation intensity algorithm was developed in methylation-positive men, using area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic as metric for performance. Next, a risk score was developed combining EpiScore with traditional clinical risk factors to further improve the identification of high-grade (Gleason Score ≥7) cancer.  Results:   Compared to other risk factors, detection of DNA-methylation in histopathologically negative biopsies was the most significant and important predictor of high-grade cancer, resulting in a NPV of 96%. In methylation-positive men, EpiScore was significantly higher for those with high-grade cancer detected upon repeat biopsy, compared to those with either no or low-grade cancer. The risk score resulted in further improvement of patient risk stratification and was a significantly better predictor compared to currently used metrics as PSA and the prostate cancer prevention trial (PCPT) risk calculator (RC). A decision curve analysis indicated strong clinical utility for the risk score as decision-making tool for repeat biopsy.  Conclusions:   Low DNA-methylation levels in PCa-negative biopsies led to a NPV of 96% for high-grade cancer. The risk score, comprising DNA-methylation intensity and traditional clinical risk factors, improved the identification of men with high-grade cancer, with a maximum avoidance of unnecessary repeat biopsies. This risk score resulted in better patient risk stratification and significantly outperformed current risk prediction models such as PCPTRC and PSA. The risk score could help to identify patients with histopathologically negative biopsies harboring high-grade PCa. Prostate 76:1078-1087, 2016. © 2016 The Authors.

Previous research has revealed that DDX20 may act as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and as a tumor promoter in breast cancer. These conflicting reports prompted us to explore the role of DDX20 in prostate cancer (PCa). To gain insight into the functions of DDX20 in PCa, we examined DDX20 expression patterns in a PCa tissue microarray with 99 PCa tissue samples. The results of immunohistochemical staining revealed that DDX20 expression is frequently upregulated in PCa tissues compared with that in the adjacent tissues and further clinicopathological analysis showed that the expression level of DDX20 closely correlates with tumor size, TNM stage (positive correlation) and patient prognosis (negative correlation). Both gain‑of- and loss‑of‑function assays were performed in vitro; the overexpression of DDX20 enhanced the proliferation and metastatic potential of cancer cells and this was examined by performing a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay. Furthermore, we found that there is a positive correlation between the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and DDX20 expression. These findings led us to examine whether DDX20 may exert effects through the NF‑κB pathway. Luciferase reporter assays suggested that DDX20 altered the activity of NF-κB.

The aim of this work is to design a tool that automates the extraction of disease-related mutations from biomedical text to advance database curation for the support of precision medicine.  Materials and methods:   We developed a machine-learning (ML) based method to automatically identify the mutations mentioned in the biomedical literature related to a particular disease. In order to predict a relationship between the mutation and the target disease, several features, such as statistical features, distance features, and sentiment features, were constructed. Our ML model was trained with a pre-labeled dataset consisting of manually curated information about mutation-disease associations. The model was subsequently used to extract disease-related mutations from larger biomedical literature corpora.  Results:   The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using a benchmarking dataset. Results show that our proposed approach gains significant improvement over the previous state of the art and obtains F-measures of 0.880 and 0.845 for prostate and breast cancer mutations, respectively.  Discussion:   To demonstrate its utility, we applied our approach to all abstracts in PubMed for 3 diseases (including a non-cancer disease). The mutations extracted were then manually validated against human-curated databases. The validation results show that the proposed approach is useful in a real-world setting to extract uncurated disease mutations from the biomedical literature.

Constitutive activation of the canonical NF-κB subunit is a critical event in prostate carcinogenesis.

Here, we investigated systemically the functional roles of RelB in prostate cancer and examine its significance as a therapeutic target. Targeting RelB using short hairpin RNA approach in androgen-independent DU145 prostate cancer cells interfered with various biological behaviors of cells. We observed that RelB knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion, and enhanced proteasome inhibitor sensitivity. The altered expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 played critical roles in regulating both spontaneous and radiation-induced apoptosis in the presence of RelB knockdown. For the first time, we showed that RelB knockdown significantly attenuated the migration and invasion of DU145 prostate cancer cells, due to the reduction of integrin β-1.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression are still unclear. Here we use a pair of prostate cell lines P69/M12, which have the same genetic background and the highly metastatic cell line M12 is a subline derived from P69, to identify the pathogenesis of PCa. We find that a key miRNA--miR186 is significantly reduced in M12 compared to that in P69. Further, we validate that miR186 is also downregulated in human PCa specimens, most significantly in the metastatic patient specimens. The low miR186 expression is correlated with poor patient survival. Through knockdown or overexpression of miR186 in PCa cell lines, we discover that miR186 strongly inhibits cell motility, invasive, soft-agar colony formation, 3D culture growth and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation capacity, as well as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by downregulation of its target Twist1. Moreover, the inverse relationship between the expression levels of miR186 and Twist1 is confirmed in vivo tumor metastasis experiment and clinical specimens. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an important role of miR186/Twist1 axis in the regulation of PCa progression, suggesting a potential application of miR186/Twist1 in PCa treatment.""","""['Xian Zhao', 'Yanli Wang', 'Rong Deng', 'Hailong Zhang', 'Jinzhuo Dou', 'Haihua Yuan', 'Guofang Hou', 'Yuzhang Du', 'Qin Chen', 'Jianxiu Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Sox5 contributes to prostate cancer metastasis and is a master regulator of TGF-β-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition through controlling Twist1 expression.', 'Comprehensive study of gene and microRNA expression related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Derived Ets Factor (PDEF) Inhibits Metastasis by Inducing Epithelial/Luminal Phenotype in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'The interplay between microRNAs and Twist1 transcription factor: a systematic review.', 'Super Carbonate Apatite-miR-497a-5p Complex Is a Promising Therapeutic Option against Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Targeting HIC1/TGF-β axis-shaped prostate cancer microenvironment restrains its progression.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'SUMOylation of YTHDF2 promotes mRNA degradation and cancer progression by increasing its binding affinity with m6A-modified mRNAs.', 'BAP1 suppresses prostate cancer progression by deubiquitinating and stabilizing PTEN.']"""

However, patients 50 years and older are entitled to a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, if informed on the advantages and disadvantages of testing and their risk of cancer. The Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme (PCRMP) provides this guidance.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to access GPs' views and understanding of PSA testing, prostate cancer screening and early detection.  Method:   A total of 708 questionnaires were returned by GPs across two English regions in 2013 and the GP questionnaire responses were quantitatively analysed.  Results:   In the 699 completed questionnaires, the majority of GPs were well informed about PSA testing, screening and early detection. Only 32% used guidelines for referral, 14% knew all age-specific PSA referral levels, 71% that Black men have a higher prostate cancer risk than White men (22% correctly answered threefold increase) and 82% that family history is a risk factor. A further 78% thought electronic prompts during consultation would encourage PCRMP guideline usage and 75% had never been offered a PSA test and prostate cancer educational course, of which 73% would like to attend a course. Only 23% were aware of the latest PSA screening evidence and 94% would like an update.  Conclusions:   Participating GPs seem to be well informed but need more information and tools to help follow recommended guidance. In particular, increased awareness of PCRMP guidelines especially by automated methods, further educational courses and evidence updates would be beneficial.""","""['J Sutton', 'J Melia', 'M Kirby', 'J Graffy', 'S Moss']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Clin Pract""","""['PSA testing for prostate cancer: an online survey of the views and reported practice of General Practitioners in the UK.', ""The PSA testing dilemma: GPs' reports of consultations with asymptomatic men: a qualitative study."", 'Early detection of prostate cancer by PSA testing: the results of a qualitative study on barriers caused by physicians in Austria implementing informed decision making.', 'Guidance on patient consultation.

Objective:   To explore changes in the normal AR transcriptome in localised prostate cancer, and its relation to adverse pathological features and disease recurrence.  Design:   Publically accessible human prostate cancer expression arrays as well as RNA sequencing data from the prostate TCGA. Tumour associated PSA and PSAD were calculated for a large cohort of men (n=1108) undergoing prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We performed a meta-analysis of the expression of an androgen-regulated gene set across datasets using Oncomine. Differential expression of selected genes in the prostate TCGA database was probed using the edgeR Bioconductor package. Changes in tumour PSA density with stage and grade were assessed by Student's t-test, and its association with biochemical recurrence explored by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression.  Results:   Meta-analysis revealed a systematic decline in the expression of a previously identified benign prostate androgen-regulated gene set with increasing tumour grade, reaching significance in nine of 25 genes tested despite increasing AR expression. These results were confirmed in a large independent dataset from the TCGA. At the protein level, when serum PSA was corrected for tumour volume, significantly lower levels were observed with increasing tumour grade and stage, and predicted disease recurrence.

The present study analyzes the effect of both these peptide hormones at concentration 10(-8)M on viability, proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion of normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT1A). Improved survival in two- and three-dimensional cell cultures was noted as well as visual changes in colony size and structure in Geltrex™. Stimulatory influence on cell viability of each peptide applied single was lower than in combination. Enhanced survival of PNT1A cells appears to be associated with increased BCL2/BAX messenger RNA (mRNA) expression ratio. Modulation of cell spreading and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion dynamics were also altered as an influence of tested hormone application. However, long-term Ang II and RLN2 effects may lead to an increase of normal prostate cell migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, gelatin zymography revealed that both gelatinases A and B were augmented by Ang II treatment, whereas RLN2 significantly stimulated only MMP-9 secretion. These results support the hypothesis that deregulation of locally secreted peptide hormones such as Ang II and RLN2 may take part in the development of certain cancers, including prostate cancer. Moreover, the observed ability of relaxin 2 to act as a regulator of mRNA expression levels not only LGR7 but also classic angiotensin receptors suggested that renin-angiotensin system and relaxin family peptide system are functionally linked.""","""['Kamila Domińska', 'Tomasz Ochędalski', 'Karolina Kowalska', 'Zuzanna E Matysiak-Burzyńska', 'Elżbieta Płuciennik', 'Agnieszka W Piastowska-Ciesielska']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Physiol Biochem""","""['Regulation of mRNA gene expression of members of the NF-κB transcription factor gene family by angiotensin II and relaxin 2 in normal and cancer prostate cell lines.', 'Interaction between angiotensin II and relaxin 2 in the progress of growth and spread of prostate cancer cells.', 'Relaxin family peptide receptors Rxfp1 and Rxfp2: mapping of the mRNA and protein distribution in the reproductive tract of the male rat.', 'Receptors for relaxin family peptides.', 'Relaxin-family peptide and receptor systems in brain: insights from recent anatomical and functional studies.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'Angiotensin II and Angiotensin Receptors 1 and 2-Multifunctional System in Cells Biology, What Do We Know?', 'Antihypertensive drug use and prostate cancer-specific mortality in Finnish men.', 'Relaxin and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 in Angiotensin II-Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.']"""

Here, we show that anoikis of luminal cells in the prostate epithelium is followed by a program of tissue repair that is mediated in part by differentiation of basal epithelial cells to luminal cells. We describe a mouse model in which inducible deletion of E-cadherin in prostate luminal cells results in their apoptotic cell death by anoikis, in the absence of phenotypic effects in the surrounding stroma. Quantitative assessments of proliferation and cell death in the luminal and basal compartments indicate that basal cells can rapidly generate luminal cells. Thus, our findings identify a role for basal-to-luminal differentiation in prostate epithelial repair, and provide a normal context to analogous processes that may occur during prostate cancer initiation.""","""['Roxanne Toivanen', 'Adithi Mohan', 'Michael M Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Stem Cell Reports""","""['Increased Notch signalling inhibits anoikis and stimulates proliferation of prostate luminal epithelial cells.', 'Klf5 acetylation regulates luminal differentiation of basal progenitors in prostate development and regeneration.', 'Notch signaling is required for normal prostatic epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells in Development and Cancer.', 'Cancer cell plasticity during tumor progression, metastasis and response to therapy.', 'Modulation of the canonical Wnt activity by androgen signaling in prostate epithelial basal stem cells.', 'Immune mechanisms shape the clonal landscape during early progression of prostate cancer.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Objective:   To develop a validated assay for detection of AR-V7 protein in tumour tissue and determine its expression and clinical significance as patients progress from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Following monoclonal antibody generation and validation, we retrospectively identified patients who had HSPC and CRPC tissue available for AR-V7 immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Nuclear AR-V7 expression was determined using IHC H score (HS) data. The change in nuclear AR-V7 expression from HSPC to CRPC and the association between nuclear AR-V7 expression and overall survival (OS) was determined.  Results and limitations:   Nuclear AR-V7 expression was significantly lower in HSPC (median HS 50, interquartile range [IQR] 17.5-90) compared to CRPC (HS 135, IQR 80-157.5; p<0.0001), and in biopsy tissue taken before (HS 80, IQR 30-136.3) compared to after (HS 140, IQR 105-167.5; p=0.007) abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment. Lower nuclear AR-V7 expression at CRPC biopsy was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio 1.012, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.020; p=0.003). While this monoclonal antibody primarily binds to AR-V7 in PC biopsy tissue, it may also bind to other proteins.  Conclusions:   We provide the first evidence that nuclear AR-V7 expression increases with emerging CRPC and is prognostic for OS, unlike antibody staining for the AR N-terminal domain. These data indicate that AR-V7 is important in CRPC disease biology; agents targeting AR splice variants are needed to test this hypothesis and further improve patient outcome from CRPC.  Patient summary:   In this study we found that levels of the protein AR-V7 were higher in patients with advanced prostate cancer. A higher level of AR-V7 identifies a group of patients who respond less well to certain prostate cancer treatments and live for a shorter period of time.""","""['Jonathan Welti', 'Daniel Nava Rodrigues', 'Adam Sharp', 'Shihua Sun', 'David Lorente', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Zafeiris Zafeiriou', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Johann S de Bono', 'Stephen R Plymate']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Making Predictive Biomarkers Readily Available.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Plasma-derived Exosomal RNA Strongly Predicts Resistance to Hormonal Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial Differences in Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR Splice Variants (AR-SVs) Expression in Treatment-Naïve Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer.', 'Urolithin A analog inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting the androgen receptor and its variant, androgen receptor-variant 7.', 'The positive relationship between androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression and the risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A cumulative analysis.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor and androgen receptor-targeting therapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.']"""

Late effects resulting from cancer and cancer therapy are being characterized, but little information exists on sexual health for men who have survived childhood cancer.  Aim:   To assess erectile dysfunction (ED) in men who survived childhood and adolescent cancers and to identify potential risk factors for ED.  Methods:   In total, 1,622 men and 271 eligible brothers in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort completed the Male Health Questionnaire, which provided information on sexual practices and sexual function. Combined with demographic, cancer, and treatment information from medical record abstraction, results of the Male Health Questionnaire were analyzed using multivariable modeling. The International Index of Erectile Function was used to identify ED in subjects.  Main outcome measure:   International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   Survivors (mean age = 37.4 years, SD = 7.3 years) reported significantly lower sexual activity in the year before the survey than the brothers (mean age = 38.8 years, SD = 8.5 years) without cancer. ED was reported by 12.3% (95% CI = 10.4-14.3) of survivors and 4.2% (95% CI = 2.0-7.9) of brothers. Survivors showed significantly higher relative risk (RR) for ED (RR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.40-4.97). In addition to older age, survivors who were exposed to higher-dose (≥10 Gy) testicular radiation (RR = 3.55, 95% CI = 1.53-8.24), had surgery on the spinal cord or nerves (RR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.36-6.05), prostate surgery (RR = 6.56, 95% CI = 3.84-11.20), or pelvic surgery (RR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.04-4.98) were at higher risk for ED.  Conclusion:   Men who have survived childhood cancer have a greater than 2.6-fold increased risk for ED and certain cancer-specific treatments are associated with increased risk. Attention to sexual health, with its physical and emotional implications, and opportunities for early detection and intervention in these individuals could be important.""","""['Chad W M Ritenour', 'Kristy D Seidel', 'Wendy Leisenring', 'Ann C Mertens', 'Karen Wasilewski-Masker', 'Margarett Shnorhavorian', 'Charles A Sklar', 'John A Whitton', 'Marilyn Stovall', 'Louis S Constine', 'Gregory T Armstrong', 'Leslie L Robison', 'Lillian R Meacham']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction in Pediatric Cancer Survivors.', 'The use of treatments for erectile dysfunction among survivors of prostate carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of erectile dysfunction risk factors in young male survivors of colorectal cancer.', 'Urological Survivorship Issues Among Adolescent Boys and Young Men Who Are Cancer Survivors.', 'Sexual rehabilitation and cancer survivorship: a state of art review of current literature and management strategies in male sexual dysfunction among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Fertility and sexual dysfunction in young male cancer survivors.', 'Adverse experiences of social adaptation in children with leukaemia: a qualitative study from China.', 'Psychosexual functioning in cancer survivorship: What the pediatric oncologist needs to know.', 'Psychosexual Care of Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancer Survivors.', 'Active Surveillance in RET Gene Carriers Belonging to Families with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia.']"""

We evaluated the incidence, growth dynamics and clinical significance of changes in prostate lesions on serial transrectal ultrasound among a large cohort of men with prostate cancer managed by active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included men with prostate cancer treated with active surveillance at UCSF (University of California-San Francisco) from 2000 to 2014 who underwent a minimum of 2 transrectal ultrasound studies. Study inclusion criteria were prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or less, clinical stage T2 or less and biopsy Gleason grade 3 + 4 or less. Progression end points included an increase in imaging stage, a 50% or greater increase in volume and an increase in the number of sites (sextants) with apparent lesions. The relationship between transrectal ultrasound progression and biopsy Gleason upgrade was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.  Results:   The 875 identified patients underwent a median of 5 transrectal ultrasound studies (IQR 3-8). Median followup was 49 months (IQR 27-81). Of the patients 345 (39%) progressed on serial transrectal ultrasound, including 51 by size, 265 by the number of lesion sites and 279 by stage. Median time to progression was 14 months. Transrectal ultrasound progression was independently associated with biopsy upgrade (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5, p <0.01).  Conclusions:   Local progression on transrectal ultrasound was associated with Gleason upgrade at biopsy. These results suggest that stable imaging findings on transrectal ultrasound may allow for increased intervals between biopsies among men on active surveillance. A prospective study is required to evaluate the usefulness of such a practice.""","""['Mohamed M Eltemamy', 'Michael S Leapman', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Antonio Westphalen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Reply by Authors.', 'Impact of Lesion Visibility on Transrectal Ultrasound on the Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 3 + 4 or Greater) with Transrectal Ultrasound-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Biopsy.', 'Prospective evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore prostate biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in biopsy naïve men with elevated prostate specific antigen.', 'Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Incremental Value.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Transrectal Ultrasound in Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of diagnostic ultrasound imaging for patients with known prostate cancer within an active surveillance pathway: A systematic review.', 'Indications for and transitioning to secondary treatment while on active surveillance for prostate cancer.']"""

Radiotherapy is recognized for its effect on local control of bone metastases, but whether it could prolong overall survival is still controversial.  Methods:   A total of 113 prostate cancer patients (<70y) with bone metastases were retrospectively analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis with log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed to find the prognostic factors with the COX regression model.  Results:   The 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-year survival rates were 97.14, 82.86, 62.61, 38.76, 25.83 and 13.84 % respectively in the radiotherapy group, and 92.75, 73.91, 54.66, 36.63, 26.03 and 17.85 % respectively in the non-radiotherapy group, which showed no significant difference. Multivariate COX regression showed the overall survival was associated with alkaline phosphatase when bone metastases occurred and the number of bone metastases.
