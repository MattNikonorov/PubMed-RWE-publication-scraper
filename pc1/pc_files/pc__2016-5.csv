Photodynamic therapy (PDT), in which low incident levels of laser energy are used to activate a photosensitizer taken up by tumor cells, is expected as a novel therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer because of the minimal invasive nature of PDT. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of a novel vector approach combined with a conventional porphyrin-based photosensitizer.  Materials and methods:   Our group focused on a non-viral vector (hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope; HVJ-E) combined with protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) lipid, termed the porphyrus envelope (PE). It has been previously confirmed that HVJ-E has drug-delivering properties and can induce cancer-specific cell death. The PE (HVJ-E contained in PpIX lipid) was developed as a novel photosensitizer. In this study, the antitumor and PDT efficacy of the PE against hormone-antagonistic human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) were evaluated.  Results and conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that, under specific circumstances, PDT using the PE was very effective against PC-3 cells. A novel therapy for drug-resistant prostate cancer based on this vector approach is eagerly anticipated.""","""['Masaya Yamauchi', 'Norihiro Honda', 'Hisanao Hazama', 'Shoji Tachikawa', 'Hiroyuki Nakamura', 'Yasufumi Kaneda', 'Kunio Awazu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Laser Ther""","""['Photodynamic therapy using a cytotoxic photosensitizer porphyrus envelope that targets the cell membrane.', 'A novel photodynamic therapy for drug-resistant prostate cancer cells using porphyrus envelope as a novel photosensitizer.', 'In vitro investigation of efficient photodynamic therapy using a nonviral vector; hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope.', 'Applications of Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan in therapeutic delivery systems.', 'Development of HVJ envelope vector and its application to gene therapy.']"""

However, a precarious understanding of how resistance emerges and a lack of tractable experimental systems hinder progress. We evaluated the potential of primary RCC cultures (derived from tumors and tumor grafts) to signal to endothelial cells (EC) and fibroblasts in vitro and to stimulate angiogenesis ex vivo in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. From 65 patients, 27 primary cultures, including several from patients with sunitinib-resistant RCC, were established. RCC cells supported EC survival in coculture assays and induced angiogenesis in CAM assays. RCC-induced EC survival was sensitive to sunitinib in half of the tumors and was refractory in tumors from resistant patients. Sunitinib sensitivity correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. RCC induced paracrine extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in EC which was inhibited by sunitinib in sensitive but not in resistant tumors. As determined by fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) phosphorylation in fibroblasts, RCC broadly induced low-level fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling. Whereas ERK activation in EC was uniformly inhibited by combined VEGF/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/FGF receptor inhibitors, paracrine ERK activation in fibroblasts was blocked in only a fraction of tumors. Our data show that RCC activates EC through VEGF-dependent and -independent pathways, that sunitinib sensitivity correlates with VEGF-mediated ERK activation, and that combined inhibition of VEGF/PDGF/FGF receptors is sufficient to inhibit mitogenic signaling in EC but not in fibroblasts.""","""['Tram Anh Tran', 'Hon Sing Leong', 'Andrea Pavia-Jimenez', 'Slavic Fedyshyn', 'Juan Yang', 'Blanka Kucejova', 'Sharanya Sivanand', 'Patrick Spence', 'Xian-Jin Xie', 'Samuel Peña-Llopis', 'Nicholas Power', 'James Brugarolas']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Adrenomedullin blockade suppresses sunitinib-resistant renal cell carcinoma growth by targeting the ERK/MAPK pathway.', 'Cellular Adaptation to VEGF-Targeted Antiangiogenic Therapy Induces Evasive Resistance by Overproduction of Alternative Endothelial Cell Growth Factors in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid signaling axis mediates tumorigenesis and development of acquired resistance to sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Importance of fibroblast growth factor receptor in neovascularization and tumor escape from antiangiogenic therapy.', 'Sunitinib, sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors in renal cancer.', 'Curcumin Inhibits Proliferation of Renal Cell Carcinoma in vitro and in vivo by Regulating miR-148/ADAMTS18 through Suppressing Autophagy.', 'Advances in Renal Cell Carcinoma Drug Resistance Models.', 'Multi-Omics Investigations Revealed Underlying Molecular Mechanisms Associated With Tumor Stiffness and Identified Sunitinib as a Potential Therapy for Reducing Stiffness in Pituitary Adenomas.', 'Microphysiological model of renal cell carcinoma to inform anti-angiogenic therapy.', 'Curcumin reverses the sunitinib resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) through the induction of ferroptosis via the ADAMTS18 gene.']"""

Therefore, AR remains as a viable therapeutic target for CRPC. All current hormonal therapies target the C-terminus ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR. By using EPI to target AR activation function-1 (AF-1), in the N-terminal domain that is essential for AR transactivation, we evaluate the ability of EPI to overcome several clinically relevant AR-related mechanisms of resistance.  Experimental design:   To study the effect of EPI on AR transcriptional activity against overexpressed coactivators, such as SRC1-3 and p300, luciferase reporter assays were performed using LNCaP cells. AR-negative COS-1 cells were employed for reporter assays to examine whether the length of polyglutamine tract affects inhibition by EPI. The effect of EPI on constitutively active AR splice variants was studied in LNCaP95 cells, which express AR-V7 variant. To evaluate the effect of EPI on the proliferation of LNCaP95 cells, we performed in vitro BrdUrd incorporation assay and in vivo studies using xenografts in mice.  Results:   EPI effectively overcame several molecular alterations underlying aberrant AR activity, including overexpressed coactivators, AR gain-of-function mutations, and constitutively active AR-V7. EPI inhibited AR transcriptional activity regardless of the length of polyglutamine tract. Importantly, EPI significantly inhibited the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of LNCaP95 prostate cancer cells, which are androgen independent and enzalutamide resistant.  Conclusions:   These findings support EPI as a promising therapeutic agent to treat CRPC, particularly against tumors driven by constitutively active AR splice variants that are resistant to LBD-targeting drugs.

In a typical sandwich-type immunosensing system, the captured spherical antibody-conjugated iron oxide NPs were transformed into cubic PB NPs, which exhibited a highly visible blue color with high molar extinction coefficients. Hence, a new colorimetric immunosensing strategy was developed as a result of this low cost and simple transformation process. Without the aid of any complex nanoparticle stabilizing ligands and signal amplification processes, prostate-specific antigen as a model analyte can be detected at a concentration as low as 1.0 ng mL(-1) by the naked eye with good reliability for detection of real human serum samples.

The main aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between HuR expression and malignant aggressiveness, outcome, and expression of cancer-related molecules in PCa. In vitro proliferation, colony formation, and migration assays were performed on LNCaP and PC-3 cells. HuR expression was knocked down (KD) using small interfering RNA. The relationships between HuR expression and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 were investigated in PCa cell lines using Western blotting. On KD of HuR, cell proliferation and migration were suppressed in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, whereas expression of VEGF-A to -D and COX-2 was suppressed in PC-3 but not in LNCaP cells. In addition, expression of these cancer-related factors was analyzed in 182 hormone-naïve PCa and 23 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) human tissues in vivo. Cytoplasmic (C)-HuR expression was significantly higher in CRPC > hormone-naïve PCa > nontumoral cells. C-HuR expression was positively associated with Gleason score, T stage, and metastasis, and it was considered to be a useful predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. C-HuR expression was correlated with COX-2 expression in hormone-naïve PCa, and with the expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and COX-2 in CRPC tissues. Our results demonstrated that HuR plays important roles in determining malignant aggressiveness and outcome in PCa, especially in androgen-independent PCa cells, via the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and expression of VEGF-A, -C, and COX-2.""","""['Kensuke Mitsunari', 'Yasuyoshi Miyata', 'Akihiro Asai', 'Tomohiro Matsuo', 'Yohei Shida', 'Tomoaki Hakariya', 'Hideki Sakai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Transl Res""","""['Upregulation of RASGRP3 expression in prostate cancer correlates with aggressive capabilities and predicts biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'PPM1D as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Overexpression of ELAV-like protein HuR is associated with increased COX-2 expression in atrophy, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and incidental prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies.', 'Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Significance and Biological Role of HuR in Head and Neck Carcinomas.', 'Infectivity-Enhanced, Conditionally Replicative Adenovirus for COX-2-Expressing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Deletion of the mRNA stability factor ELAVL1 (HuR) in pancreatic cancer cells disrupts the tumor microenvironment integrity.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'SOCS7/HuR/FOXM1 signaling axis inhibited high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma progression.', 'Roles of Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision-Like RNA Binding Proteins in Cancer and Beyond.']"""

The objective of this study is to compare the performance of race-specific GRS and nonrace-specific GRS for predicting prostate cancer (PCa) among 1338 patients underwent prostate biopsy in Shanghai, China. A race-specific GRS was calculated with seven PCa risk-associated SNPs implicated in East Asians (GRS7), and a nonrace-specific GRS was calculated based on 76 PCa risk-associated SNPs implicated in at least one racial group (GRS76). The means of GRS7 and GRS76 were 1.19 and 1.85, respectively, in the study population. Higher GRS7 and GRS76 were independent predictors for PCa and high-grade PCa in univariate and multivariate analyses. GRS7 had a better area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) than GRS76 for discriminating PCa (0.602 vs 0.573) and high-grade PCa (0.603 vs 0.575) but did not reach statistical significance. GRS7 had a better (up to 13% at different cutoffs) positive predictive value (PPV) than GRS76.

Methods:   The expression of reporter genes under the control of these promoters demonstrated selectivity in cancer cell lines of breast, prostate and ovarian origins versus a panel of normal cell types. The (P) ran was next used to regulate the expression of a bioactive exon (a constitutively active form of human caspase 3) to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Further evaluation was performed in an orthotopic model of murine bladder cancer.  Results:   The average strengths of reporter expression had relative intensities of 99.8% ((P) ran), 87.7% ((P) brms1) and 55.8% ((P) mcm5) versus the strong (P) cmv-driven positive control. Comparisons of expression-targeted reporter gene expression for these three promoters versus the clinically interesting promoter for the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ((P) hTERT) yielded an improvement of two- to 15-fold. Following transfection, cell death was evident from morphologic observations and viability assays performed on the cancer cells lines, with little (if any) effects seen when the same genes were delivered to normal cells. Cell viability was reduced by up to 60% after one treatment, with cell death via apoptosis implied by caspase 3 detection. During the in vivo preclinical study, reduced tumor burden, lack of mineralization and decreased inflammation were demonstrated after only three treatments.  Conclusions:   The ran, brms1, and mcm5 promoters have the specificity and strength needed for cancer-specific expression-targeted gene therapy.

Given the current landscape in which magnetic resonance imaging criteria and biomarker cutoffs are validated for disparate adverse pathology definitions, we sought to identify which of these is most closely tied to biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP.  Materials and methods:   A total of 2,837 patients who underwent RP at a single institution for localized prostate cancer (PCa) were included. We evaluated the following existing definitions of adverse pathology at RP: (1) Gleason score ≥7, (2) primary Gleason pattern ≥4, (3) Gleason score ≥7 or pathologic stage T3-4, (4) pathologic stage T3-4, (5) primary Gleason pattern ≥4 or pathologic stage T3-4. The primary outcome measure was BCR. Multiple statistical techniques were used to assess BCR prediction.  Results:   Of the 5 definitions assessed, 1 (primary Gleason pattern ≥4 or pathologic stage T3-4, 540 patients [19% of cohort]) consistently outperformed the other definitions across all statistical measures. Additionally, a total of only 13 (6.6%) and 34 (10.3%) men with very-low-risk and low-risk cancer per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline, respectively, met this definition of adverse pathology at the time of RP.  Conclusions:   Varying definitions of adverse pathology differ in their prognostic performance. The criteria defined by either primary Gleason pattern ≥4 or pT3-4 disease appears to most accurately predict BCR in this subset of patients with lower risk PCa at the time of diagnosis. Additionally, men with very-low-risk or low-risk PCa per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are relatively unlikely to have adverse pathology at the time of surgical resection.

Methods:   A total of 391 patients treated with HT between June 2006 and December 2013 were included in this retrospective study. All patients received neoadjuvant ADT for a median duration of 10 months followed by HT at a median dose of 78 Gy [interquartile range (IQR) 78-78]. The times of median adjuvant and total ADT were 19 and 27 months (IQR 20-31), respectively. The risk stratification followed the 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) followed the Phoenix definition. Toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity grading scale.  Results:   Median follow-up from HT start was 60 months (IQR 42-81). Five-year bDFS rates for low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk groups were 100, 98.2, 97.7, and 87.9 %, respectively. We observed clinical relapse in nine very-high-risk patients and one high-risk patient, resulting in a 5-year clinical relapse-free survival of 100, 100, 99.4, and 91.7 %, respectively, for each risk group. Three patients died of prostate cancer, resulting in a 5-year prostate cancer-specific survival of 99.6 %. The late grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were 9.7 and 10.7 %. No cardiovascular fatal events were observed.

We conducted a retrospective, comparative study of post-operative radiation following radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with pT3 disease or positive margins (adverse pathological features, APF).  Methods:   422 PCa men treated at four institutions with RP and having APF were analyzed with a primary end point of metastasis. Adjuvant radiation treatment (ART, n=111), minimal residual disease (MRD) SRT (n=70) and SRT (n=83) were defined by PSA levels of <0.2, 0.2-0.49 and ⩾0.5 ng ml(-1), respectively, before radiation therapy (RT) initiation. Remaining 157 men who did not receive additional therapy before metastasis formed the no RT arm. Clinical-genomic risk was assessed by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical (CAPRA-S) and Decipher. Cox regression was used to evaluate the impact of treatment on outcome.  Results:   During the study follow-up, 37 men developed metastasis with a median follow-up of 8 years. Both CAPRA-S and Decipher had independent predictive value on multivariable analysis for metastasis (P<0.05). Adjusting for clinical-genomic risk, SRT and no RT had hazard ratios of 4.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-15.47) and 5.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.59-18.44) for metastasis compared with ART, respectively. No significant difference was observed between MRD-SRT and ART (P=0.28). Men with low-to-intermediate CAPRA-S and low Decipher value have a low rate of metastatic events regardless of treatment selection. In contrast, men with high CAPRA-S and Decipher benefit from ART, however the cumulative incidence of metastasis remains high.  Conclusions:   The decision as to the timing and need for additional local therapy following RP is nuanced and requires providers and patients to balance risks of morbidity with improved oncological outcomes. Post-RP treatment can be safely avoided for men who are low risk by clinical-genomic risk, whereas those at high risk should favor enrollment in clinical trials.""","""['A E Ross', 'R B Den', 'K Yousefi', 'B J Trock', 'J Tosoian', 'E Davicioni', 'D J S Thompson', 'V Choeurng', 'Z Haddad', 'P T Tran', 'E J Trabulsi', 'L G Gomella', 'C D Lallas', 'F Abdollah', 'F Y Feng', 'E A Klein', 'A P Dicker', 'S J Freedland', 'R J Karnes', 'E M Schaeffer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'Genomic classifier identifies men with adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy who benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy for Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Early salvage radiation therapy of the prostate bed appears to be equally effective compared to adjuvant radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline Amendment 2018-2019.', 'Are localized prostate cancer biomarkers useful in the clinical practice?', 'Molecular correlates of intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Using a multi-institutional tissue microarray resource including over 1000 radical prostatectomy samples, we sought to correlate Ki67 expression captured by an automated image analysis system with clinicopathological features and validate its utility as a clinical grade test in predicting cancer-specific outcomes.  Methods:   After immunostaining, the Ki67 proliferation index (PI) of tumor areas of each core (three cancer cores/case) was analyzed using a nuclear quantification algorithm (Aperio). We assessed whether Ki67 PI was associated with clinicopathological factors and recurrence-free survival (RFS) including biochemical recurrence, metastasis or PC death (7-year median follow-up).  Results:   In 1004 PCs (∼4000 tissue cores) Ki67 PI showed significantly higher inter-tumor (0.68) than intra-tumor variation (0.39). Ki67 PI was associated with stage (P<0.0001), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI, P=0.02), extracapsular extension (ECE, P<0.0001) and Gleason score (GS, P<0.0001).

Methods:   Three geometrical-models (GMs) were implemented in the TPS to represent the three different regions of the couch (thick, medium and thin). The materials and densities of each GM component were tuned to maximize the agreement between measured and calculated attenuations. Moreover, a couch computed-tomography (CT) scan was acquired and dosimetrically compared with the GMs. For validation, plan-specific quality assurance (QA) of VMAT plans (TG-119 cases, 5 prostate and 5 H&N clinical cases) was performed by comparing measured dose distributions with doses computed with and without including the GMs in the TPS.  Results:   Couch attenuations up to 4.3% were measured (energy: 6MV). Compared to couch CT, GMs could be modified to optimize the agreement with measurements and reduce dependence on the dose grid resolution. For both couch CT and GM, absolute deviations between measured and calculated attenuations were within 1.0%. When including the GMs in plan-specific QA, global 2%/2mm γ-pass rates showed an average improvement of 4.8% (p-value<0.001, max +18.6%). The couch reduced the mean dose to targets by up to 2.4% of the prescribed dose for prostate cases and up to 1.4% for H&N cases.

One of the major sources of exposure to arsenic is through naturally contaminated drinking water. While positive associations have been observed between arsenic in drinking water and prostate cancer, few studies have explored this association in the United States.  Objectives:   To evaluate the association between inorganic arsenic concentrations in community water systems and prostate cancer incidence in Illinois using an ecologic study design.  Methods:   Illinois Environmental Protection Agency data on arsenic concentrations in drinking water from community water systems throughout the state were linked with county-level prostate cancer incidence data from 2007 to 2011 from the Illinois State Cancer Registry. Incidence rates were indirectly standardized by age to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each county. A Poisson regression model was used to model the association between county-level SIRs and mean arsenic tertile (0.33-0.72, 0.73-1.60, and 1.61-16.23ppb), adjusting for potential confounders.  Results:   For counties with mean arsenic levels in the second tertile, the SIR was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.96-1.16). For counties with mean arsenic levels in the third tertile, the SIR was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03-1.19). There was a significant linear dose-response relationship observed between mean arsenic levels and prostate cancer incidence (p for trend=0.003).  Conclusions:   In this ecologic study, counties with higher mean arsenic levels in community water systems had significantly higher prostate cancer incidence.

However, there are no consensuses regarding the impact of previous laparoscopic experience on the learning curve of RALP. We report on a functional and perioperative outcome comparison between our initial 60 cases of RALP and last 60 cases of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), performed by three experienced laparoscopic surgeons with a 200+LRP cases experience.  Materials and methods:   Between January 2010 and September 2013, a total of 60 consecutive patients who have undergone RALP were prospectively evaluated and compared to the last 60 cases of LRP. Data included demographic data, operative duration, blood loss, transfusion rate, positive surgical margins, hospital stay, complications and potency and continence rates.  Results:   The mean operative time and blood loss were higher in RALP (236 versus 153 minutes, p<0.001 and 245.6 versus 202ml p<0.001). Potency rates at 6 months were higher in RALP (70% versus 50% p=0.02). Positive surgical margins were also higher in RALP (31.6% versus 12.5%, p=0.01). Continence rates at 6 months were similar (93.3% versus 89.3% p=0.43). Patient's age, complication rates and length of hospital stay were similar for both groups.

Despite the technological and pharmacological improvements, the problem of bacterial urosepsis after prostate biopsy remains. A strategy for preventing urosepsis following TRUS prostate biopsy in áreas with high prevalence of resistant strains or patients presenting risk factors is lacking.  Objectives:   The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of urosepsis, as well its predictors, following TRUS guided needle biopsy of the prostate in a tertiary care medical center in Lebanon.  Materials and methods:   We carried out a retrospective study on all patients who underwent TRUS prostate biopsy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between January 1, 2011 and June 31, 2013. Patients' hospital charts were reviewed. Data collected included demographic information, pre-procedure disease specific information, as well as post-procedure information. Predictors of urosepsis following TRUS were assessed.  Results:   In total, 265 patients were included in this study, where the prevalence of urosepsis following TRUS prostate biopsy was found to be 9.4%. The significant independente predictors of urosepsis were found to be: age with an OR=0.93 (95% CI: 0.88-1.00, p-value=0.03), and hypertension comorbidity with an OR=3.25 (95% CI: 1.19-8.85, p-value=0.02).

Three dimensional flowers like hierarchical carbon/gold nanoparticles/bilirubin oxidase (3D FCM/AuNPs/BOD) bioconjugate served as biocatalyst for O2 reduction at the biocathode. With an increase in the concentration of PSA, the amount of BOD labels on biocathode increases, thus leading to the higher current output of the as-proposed visible light driven BFC. Based on this, this sensing platform provide great performance in sensitivity and specificity, increasing linear detection range from 0.3pgmL(-1) to 7μgmL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.1pgmL(-1).

Materials and methods:   PCa patients with ≤3 lymph nodes (N1/M1a) at the time of recurrence were treated with SBRT. SBRT was defined as a radiotherapy dose of at least 5 Gy per fraction to a biological effective dose of at least 80 Gy to all metastatic sites. Distant progression-free survival was defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and appearance of new metastatic lesions, outside the high-dose region. Relapses after SBRT were recorded and compared with the initially treated site. Secondary end points were local control, time to palliative androgen deprivation therapy and toxicity scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.  Results:   Overall, 89 metastases were treated in 72 patients. The median distant progression-free survival was 21 months (95% confidence interval 16-25 months) with 88% of patients having ≤3 metastases at the time of progression. The median time from first SBRT to the start of palliative androgen deprivation therapy was 44 months (95% confidence interval 17-70 months). Most relapses (68%) occurred in nodal regions. Relapses after pelvic nodal SBRT (n = 36) were located in the pelvis (n = 14), retroperitoneum (n = 1), pelvis and retroperitoneum (n = 8) or in non-nodal regions (n = 13). Relapses after SBRT for extrapelvic nodes (n = 5) were located in the pelvis (n = 1) or the pelvis and retroperitoneum (n = 4).

Recent studies have shown promise of radiolabeled analogues of choline for positron emission tomography (PET) scans in patients of biochemical recurrence and that sequentially incremental Fluorocholine (FCH) uptake is associated with malignancy, whereas decreasing tracer activity suggests a benign aetiology. However, this pattern of tracer uptake has not been fully validated, and no standardized (18)F-Fluorocholine ((18)F-FCH) scan protocol is in place yet. This study aimed to better define the role of dual-phase (18)F-FCH PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging using retrospective masked reading focusing on detection of locoregional recurrence/metastasis in patients with biochemical failure after definitive local primary treatment.  Methods:   A total of 32 subjects were enrolled during the period 04/2010 to 05/2014 with histologically proven prostate cancer that was treated with curative intent and had biochemical recurrence. Early scans and delayed imaging of the pelvis were graded separately by blinded readers. Final evaluation using the combination of information from dual-phase studies as a ""summation scan"" was also performed. Maximum standardized uptake value was computed using regions of interest constructed over focal hyperactivity. Calculations were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions, Version 20 for Windows. A composite reference consisting of histopathology, correlation with other imaging, or serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) trend with clinical follow-up of at least 6months was used to determine the true disease status of the patient.  Results:   Early-phase pelvis imaging sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 73.1% and 90.9%, respectively. Late-phase pelvis imaging sensitivity and specificity were 80.8% and 100%, respectively. Summation scan sensitivity and specificity were 76.9% and 100%, respectively. The odds ratio of having recurrent disease with an uptrend of SUVmax on dual-phase imaging was 33.3. The optimal cutoff value of PSA was 1.85ng/mL with 80% sensitivity and 62.5% specificity.  Conclusions:   Single late-phase FCH PET/CT imaging is a reliable scan modality which can detect sites of disease at low levels of PSA which still fulfil the criteria of biochemical recurrence.

Mitochondrial damage was examined by transmission electron microscopy. DNA damage was detected with comet assay. Apoptotic, DNA damage- and cell cycle-related proteins were analyzed using Western blotting. The expression of DNA repair genes was measured with qRT-PCR.  Results:   Both JA and JB exerted potent anti-proliferative action against the 9 cancer cell lines, and PC3 cells were more sensitive with IC50 values of 1.34±0.09 and 4.93±0.20 μmol/L, respectively. JA (1.5 μmol/L) and JB (5 μmol/L) induced PC3 cell apoptosis, which was attenuated by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Furthermore, both JA and JB caused mitochondrial damage and ROS accumulation in PC3 cells, whereas vitamin C blocked the ROS accumulation and attenuated the cytotoxicity of JA and JB. Moreover, both JA and JB induced DNA damage, accompanied by downregulated DNA repair proteins Ku70/Ku80 and RDA51. JA induced marked cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, which was related to c-Myc suppression, whereas JB enforced the cell cycle blockade in the G2/M phase, which associated with activation of the JNK signaling.  Conclusion:   Both JA and JB induce prostate cancer apoptosis via ROS accumulation and induction of cell cycle arrest.""","""['Yan-Xia Guo', 'Zhao-Min Lin', 'Mei-Juan Wang', 'Yi-Wen Dong', 'Huan-Min Niu', 'Charles Yf Young', 'Hong-Xiang Lou', 'Hui-Qing Yuan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Pharmacol Sin""","""['Mechanistic Pathways and Molecular Targets of Plant-Derived Anticancer ent-Kaurane Diterpenes.', 'Induction of apoptosis by new ent-kaurene-type diterpenoids isolated from the New Zealand liverwort Jungermannia species.', 'Dryopteris crassirhizoma has anti-cancer effects through both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and G0/G1 phase arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Adenosine induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines, LNcap-FGC-10, DU-145, and PC3.', '2-Chloroadenosine and human prostate cancer cells.', 'Helenalin Facilitates Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest by Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase-1 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Marine alkaloid monanchoxymycalin C: a new specific activator of JNK1/2 kinase with anticancer properties.', 'Mechanistic Pathways and Molecular Targets of Plant-Derived Anticancer ent-Kaurane Diterpenes.', 'Dietary Compounds for Targeting Prostate Cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.']"""

Hence, the goal of the study is to identify a biomarker that could distinguish malignant cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) during the early diagnosis of the disease.  Materials and methods:   A total of 75 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) with matching controls, 4 paired metastatic tumors, 6 fresh tumor tissues and BPH (13 cases) with their clinical diagnosis were selected for this study. Prostate cancer cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cell lines were obtained from ATCC and subjected to phenotypic analysis.  Results:   We observed significant differential expression of miR-301a in CaP samples in comparison to BPH and adjacent benign samples. The overexpression of miR-301a activates the invasion/migration of CaP cells. In contrast, silencing miR-301a expression inhibited the colony-forming ability, adhesion, invasion and migration of CaP cells. Similarly, the overexpression of miR-301a increased cell motility in normal RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. Our results suggest that miR-301a is differentially expressed between BPH and CaP specimens and that the expression of miR-301a correlates with biochemical recurrence and/or metastasis in CaP patients.  Conclusions:   The expression of miR-301a could be a potential marker for metastasis in CaP patients.

To demonstrate the efficacy of our Ptl@FNP we performed in vitro and in vivo studies using a human prostate tumor model.

In recent years, although a lot of research in the mechanism of osteosarcoma development and metastasis had been done, the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. MicroRNAs (miRs), as small noncoding RNA sequences, are dysregulated in various diseases, including cancer, negatively modulating the target genes expression by posttranscriptional repression. MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) has been reported to be reduced in cancers, including pituitary, colorectal, prostate cancer and cervical. We were aimed to detect the effects of miR-143 on osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration as well as to indicate the potential molecular mechanisms by which miR-143 regulated osteosarcoma. After miR-143 transfection, the cancer cells migration and invasion were examined. And Western blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunochemistry assays were performed to analyze the role of miR-143 in osteosarcoma progression. The results suggested that miR-143 expressed lessly in osteosarcoma cell lines and could suppress cell migration and invasion in U2-OS and MG-63 cells. To our knowledge, it was the first time to target Bcl-2 directly to explore the underlying mechanism by which miR-143 performed its role to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, thus improving osteosarcoma progression. The present study indicated that miR-143 could inhibit Bcl-2 expression, causing Caspas3 activation, thus inducing apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. MiR-143 may therefore sreve as a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma, and the regulation of its expression might be a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma treatment.""","""['Wei-Hua Li', 'Hao-Jie Wu', 'Yu-Xia Li', 'Hua-Gang Pan', 'Tao Meng', 'Xiao Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['MicroRNA-744 inhibited cervical cancer growth and progression through apoptosis induction by regulating Bcl-2.', 'MicroRNA-34a inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis in osteosarcoma partly by effecting C-IAP2 and Bcl-2.', 'LncRNA TUG1 promotes cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in osteosarcoma by regulating miR-212-3p/FOXA1 axis.', 'Role of microRNA-1 in human cancer and its therapeutic potentials.', 'Role of miR-181a in the process of apoptosis of multiple malignant tumors: A literature review.', 'The biological function of m6A methyltransferase KIAA1429 and its role in human disease.', 'Role of extracellular vesicles in osteosarcoma.', 'Injectable, Anti-Cancer Drug-Eluted Chitosan Microspheres against Osteosarcoma.', 'Restoration of miRNA-143 Expression Inhibits Growth and Migration of MKN-45 Gastric Cancer Cell Line.', 'Molecular mechanism of microRNAs regulating apoptosis in osteosarcoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Young men (<40 years old) with the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma undergoing RARC with orthotopic neobaldder formation were eligible for our technique of nerve-sparing cystoprostatectomy with prostatic apex preservation at the time of orthotopic ileal conduit urinary diversion. During the apical prostatic dissection step of the RARC, the plane of dissection is directed under the dorsal vein complex and through anterior prostatic fibromuscular stroma. This plane is further carried through the prostatic urethra, transecting the most caudal aspect of prostatic peripheral zone posteriorly, to create a long urethra and a posterior urethral plate formed by peripheral zone of the prostate, which serves as a robust, long stump for the subsequent vesicourethral anastomosis.  Results:   From January 2013 to January 2014, 3 men were treated with RARC and intracorporeal neobladder urinary diversion based on the described technique. There were no intraoperative complications. Two patients experienced grade II complications postoperatively. Pathologic assessment demonstrated negative surgical margins in all 3 cases.

However, because of the relationship between prostate cancer and androgen receptor activation, testosterone therapy among patients with known prostate cancer has been approached with caution.  Materials and methods:   We identified a cohort of 82 hypogonadal men with prostate cancer who were treated with testosterone therapy. They included 50 men treated with radiation therapy, 22 treated with radical prostatectomy, 8 on active surveillance, 1 treated with cryotherapy and 1 who underwent high intensity focused ultrasound. We monitored prostate specific antigen, testosterone, hemoglobin, biochemical recurrence and prostate specific antigen velocity.  Results:   Median patient age was 75.5 years and median followup was 41 months. We found an increase in testosterone (p <0.001) and prostate specific antigen (p = 0.001) in the entire cohort. Prostate specific antigen increased in patients on active surveillance. However, no patients were upgraded to higher Gleason score on subsequent biopsies and none have yet gone on to definitive treatment. We did not note any biochemical recurrence among patients treated with radical prostatectomy but 3 (6%) treated with radiation therapy experienced biochemical recurrence. It is unclear whether these cases were related to testosterone therapy or reflected the natural biology of the disease. We calculated mean prostate specific antigen velocity as 0.001, 0.12 and 1.1 μg/l per year in the radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and active surveillance groups, respectively.

All four tools agreed in their placement of participants into limited or not-limited long-term life expectancy in 77.1% of participants (<25% chance of surviving 9 or 10 years). Rates of cancer screening were similarly high in individuals with limited long-term life expectancy regardless of the tool used: greater than 31% for mammographic screening in women and greater than 69% for prostate cancer screening.  Conclusion:   There is substantial agreement among different prognostic tools for short- and long-term survival in Medicare beneficiaries. The high rates of cancer screening of individuals with limited life expectancy suggest the importance of incorporating tools into clinical decision-making.""","""['Craig Evan Pollack', 'Amanda L Blackford', 'Nancy L Schoenborn', 'Cynthia M Boyd', 'Kimberly S Peairs', 'Eva H DuGoff']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Am Geriatr Soc""","""['Comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy: a new tool to inform recommendations for optimal screening strategies.', 'Influence of Age, Health, and Function on Cancer Screening in Older Adults with Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Assessment of Clinician Decision-making on Cancer Screening Cessation in Older Adults With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Predicting Life Expectancy for Older Adults with Cancer in Clinical Practice: Implications for Shared Decision-making.', 'Cancer-screening for older patients.', 'Estimating life expectancy adjusted by self-rated health status in the United States: national health interview survey linked to the mortality.', 'National profile of the growing population of older adults who access community health centers.', 'Unrelated Death After Colorectal Cancer Screening: Implications for Improving Colonoscopy Referrals.', 'Predicting 7-year mortality for use with evidence-based guidelines for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) testing: findings from a large prospective study of 123\u2009697 Australian men.', 'Cancer Screening of Older Adults in Israel According to Life Expectancy: Cross Sectional Study.']"""

Methods and materials:   This analysis pertains to 125 patients (70 from a pilot study and 55 from an observational protocol) for whom 1 baseline and at least 3 subsequent blood samples (median 6), obtained at irradiation midpoint and end, and thereafter at 3, 6, and 12 months, were available. Patients were treated with adjuvant (n=73) or salvage intent; static-field IMRT (n=19); volumetric modulated arc therapy (n=60) or helical Tomotherapy (n=46); and conventional (n=39) or moderately hypofractionated (median 2.35 Gy per fraction, n=86) regimens. The median 2-Gy equivalent dose (EQD2) to the prostatic bed was 70.4 Gy with a lymph-nodal planning target volume of 50.2 Gy. Clinical and dosimetric data were collected.  Results:   Both leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were significant (median nadir count 65% and 67% of baseline, respectively), with leukopenia also persisting (1-year median count 75% of baseline). Lymphopenia was the major contributor to the severity and 1-year persistence of leukopenia; all patients developed acute grade ≥1 lymphopenia (61% and 26% grade 2 and ≥3, respectively), whereas 1-year grade ≥2 lymphopenia was still present in 16%. In addition to an independent predictive role of corresponding baseline values, multivariable analyses highlighted that higher EQD2 doses to lymph nodal planning target volume increased risk of acute neutropenia and hypofractionation for acute thrombocytopenia. Of note, patients of older age were at higher risk for acute grade 2 lymphopenia, and interestingly, increased risk of grade >2 lymphopenia for those who smoked at least one year. No role for different IMRT techniques indicated.  Conclusions:   Leukopenia and lymphopenia after postprostatectomy WPRT were found to be less negligible and more prolonged than expected. A number of radiation-related and clinical factors favoring hematologic toxicity, whose awareness may be crucial when prescribing WPRT, in particular if concomitant to chemotherapy, were identified.""","""['Cesare Cozzarini', 'Barbara Noris Chiorda', 'Carla Sini', 'Claudio Fiorino', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Nadia Di Muzio']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Higher-than-expected severe (Grade 3-4) late urinary toxicity after postprostatectomy hypofractionated radiotherapy: a single-institution analysis of 1176 patients.', 'Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Dose-volume effects for pelvic bone marrow in predicting hematological toxicity in prostate cancer radiotherapy with pelvic node irradiation.', 'Whole-pelvic nodal radiation therapy in the context of hypofractionation for high-risk prostate cancer patients: a step forward.', 'The Impact of Pelvic Nodal Radiotherapy on Hematologic Toxicity: A Systematic Review with Focus on Leukopenia, Lymphopenia and Future Perspectives in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Dosimetric and Hematologic Implications of Prostate-Only Versus Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy: Results of the Multicentric Phase 3 PROPER Study.', 'Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life in a Post-Prostatectomy Ablative Radiation Therapy (POPART) Multicentric Trial.', 'Modulation of Peripheral Immune Cell Subpopulations After RapidArc/Moderate Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Findings and Comparison With 3D Conformal/Conventional Fractionation Treatment.', 'Radiotherapy planning parameters correlate with changes in the peripheral immune status of patients undergoing curative radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of Patient-Reported Incontinence at Adjuvant/Salvage Radiotherapy after Prostatectomy: Impact of Time between Surgery and Radiotherapy.']"""

Among the current treatments, (R)-bicalutamide and enzalutamide are non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist drugs approved also in the case of castration-resistant forms. Both these drugs present a moderate antiproliferative activity and their use is limited due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological target. Insertion of fluorinated and perfluorinated groups in biologically active compounds is a current trend in medicinal chemistry, applied to improve their efficacy and stability profiles. As a means to obtain such effects, different modifications with perfluoro groups were rationally designed on the bicalutamide and enzalutamide structures, leading to the synthesis of a series of new antiproliferative compounds. Several new analogues displayed improved in vitro activity towards four different prostate cancer cell lines, while maintaining full AR antagonism and therefore representing promising leads for further development.

The aim of this study was to assess the biopsy efficiency of MR/ultrasound (MR/US) fusion-guided (""targeted"") biopsies vs extended-sextant 12-core (""standard"") biopsies for overall and high-grade prostate cancer detection.  Methods:   From August 2007 to February 2014, 1003 men were enrolled in a prospective trial comparing the diagnostic yield of targeted and standard prostate biopsies performed during the same session. A total of 17 619 biopsy cores were reviewed. Biopsy efficiency was determined by dividing the total number of cores by the number of positive cores obtained. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   A mean of 12.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.2 to 12.3) standard and 5.3 (95% CI = 5.1 to 5.5) targeted biopsy cores were obtained from each patient.

The percentage of biopsy cores positive for prostate cancer, irrespective of grade, was statistically significantly higher for targeted than for standard biopsies (27.9% vs 13.5%, respectively, P < .001), with 11.5 targeted cores vs 26.2 standard cores utilized per diagnosis of prostate cancer. For detection of high-grade cancer, 30.7 targeted vs 100.8 standard cores were utilized per diagnosis.

Methods and materials:   In the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 7 trial, 880 men with locally advanced prostate cancer were randomized to hormonal therapy alone versus hormonal therapy plus radiation therapy to 70 Gy. A subcohort from this trial being randomized at our center (n=178) was invited to a study on late anorectal side effects during 2003-2005, approximately 5 years after treatment, including measuring health-reported quality of life and physician-assessed toxicity score by the Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT/SOMA) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group score. Sixty-seven patients had a rectal mucosa biopsy. Sixty-four biopsies were included in the final analysis, of which 33 patients were randomized to hormonal treatment and 31 to hormonal treatment plus radiation therapy. The presence of fibrosis, number of capillaries, and lymphocyte infiltration was then evaluated by light microscopy.  Results:   The group receiving radiation therapy had significantly higher LENT/SOMA and function/bother scale scores than the group that only received hormonal treatment, but there was no significant difference in the presence of fibrosis, ectasia, number of capillaries in the lamina propria, or lymphocyte infiltration between the groups.  Conclusion:   Radiation therapy to 70 Gy to the prostate does not induce long-term microscopic mucosal changes in the rectum 5 years after treatment. This is in contrast to the general assumption that structural changes, including fibrosis, seen after radiation therapy include the mucosa. We speculate that the main late effects of radiation therapy on the structure of the rectum are located in the deeper layers of the rectal wall than the mucosa.""","""['Jens Erik Slagsvold', 'Trond Viset', 'Arne Wibe', 'Stein Kaasa', 'Anders Widmark', 'Jo-Åsmund Lund']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Late radiation effects to the rectum and anus after treatment for prostate cancer; validity of the LENT/SOMA score.', 'Grading-system-dependent volume effects for late radiation-induced rectal toxicity after curative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Rectal wall sparing by dosimetric effect of rectal balloon used during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Comparison of late rectal toxicity from conventional versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors.', 'Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy in the Setting of a Rectal Vascular Malformation.', 'High-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer: genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicity and outcomes, a single-institution experience.']"""

The purpose of this study was to verify the delivery accuracy of DWA approach and to evaluate the potential dosimetric benefits.  Methods:   DWA is an extended form of VMAT with a continuous varying ring position. The main difference in the optimization modules of VMAT and DWA is during the angular spacing, where the DWA algorithm does not consider the gantry spacing, but only the Euclidian norm of the ring and gantry angle. A preclinical version of RayStation v4.6 (RaySearch Laboratories, Sweden) was used to create patient specific wave arc trajectories for 31 patients with various anatomical tumor regions (prostate, oligometatstatic cases, centrally-located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer-LAPC). DWA was benchmarked against the current clinical approaches and coplanar VMAT. Each plan was evaluated with regards to dose distribution, modulation complexity (MCS), monitor units and treatment time efficiency. The delivery accuracy was evaluated using a 2D diode array that takes in consideration the multi-dimensionality of DWA during dose reconstruction.  Results:   In centrally-located NSCLC cases, DWA improved the low dose spillage with 20 %, while the target coverage was increased with 17 % compared to 3D CRT. The structures that significantly benefited from using DWA were proximal bronchus and esophagus, with the maximal dose being reduced by 17 % and 24 %, respectively. For prostate and LAPC, neither technique seemed clearly superior to the other; however, DWA reduced with more than 65 % of the delivery time over IMRT. A steeper dose gradient outside the target was observed for all treatment sites (p < 0.01) with DWA. Except the oligometastatic cases, where the DWA-MCSs indicate a higher modulation, both DWA and VMAT modalities provide plans of similar complexity. The average ɣ (3 % /3 mm) passing rate for DWA plans was 99.2 ± 1 % (range from 96.8 to 100 %).  Conclusions:   DWA proven to be a fully functional treatment technique, allowing additional flexibility in dose shaping, while preserving dosimetrically robust delivery and treatment times comparable with coplanar VMAT.""","""['Manuela Burghelea', 'Dirk Verellen', 'Kenneth Poels', 'Cecilia Hung', 'Mitsuhiro Nakamura', 'Jennifer Dhont', 'Thierry Gevaert', 'Robbe Van den Begin', 'Christine Collen', 'Yukinori Matsuo', 'Takahiro Kishi', 'Viorica Simon', 'Masahiro Hiraoka', 'Mark de Ridder']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Treating patients with Dynamic Wave Arc: First clinical experience.', 'Evaluation of volumetric modulated arc therapy for cranial radiosurgery using multiple noncoplanar arcs.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy for stereotactic body radiotherapy of lung tumors: a comparison with intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques.', 'The gimbaled-head radiotherapy system: Rise and downfall of a dedicated system for dynamic tumor tracking with real-time monitoring and dynamic WaveArc.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'An Investigation of Non-Coplanar Volumetric Modulated Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Using a Trajectory Optimization Method.', 'Cognition: development of a cognitive testing battery on the iPad for the evaluation of patients with brain Mets.', 'Complementing Prostate SBRT VMAT With a Two-Beam Non-Coplanar IMRT Class Solution to Enhance Rectum and Bladder Sparing With Minimum Increase in Treatment Time.', 'Single-isocenter volumetric-modulated Dynamic WaveArc therapy for two brain metastases.', 'Quality assurance of non-coplanar, volumetric-modulated arc therapy employing a C-arm linear accelerator, featuring continuous patient couch rotation.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study included 314 AS patients who had at least 1 repeat biopsy. We used logistic regression to analyze the association between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its derivatives, including PSA density, PSA velocity (PSAV) and doubling time (PSADT); presence of bilateral disease and number of previous successive negative surveillance biopsies; and the risk of progression on the surveillance biopsies first through fourth.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years, patients had a mean of 2.4 biopsies. The median time from diagnosis to the last biopsy was 2.3 years. The biopsies were performed at fairly equal intervals. For surveillance biopsies 1 through 3, none of the studied factors was adding significant prognostic information to the baseline characteristics. PSAV and PSADT were associated with the risk of progression on the fourth biopsy; this association was independent of baseline characteristics.

Methods:   Forty-six consecutive patients underwent office-based transperineal prostate biopsy for an elevated prostate-specific antigen and a normal digital rectal examination without prior prostate biopsy. Prior to biopsy, a repeat prostate-specific antigen was obtained to ensure persistent elevation. Silodosin (8 mg daily) was initiated the day prior to biopsy and continued for 1 week. A total of 18-20 biopsy cores were obtained per patient. All patients responded to a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10 immediately following the completion of both the local anesthesia and the biopsy procedure. In addition, an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Rectal Function Assessment Score, International Index of Erectile Function, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and postvoid residual were obtained at baseline and 30 days following biopsy, except IPSS which was also obtained at day 7.  Results:   The mean patient age was 63.3 years with a mean prostate volume of 41.8 cm(3). The mean visual analog scale was 4.2 for the local anesthesia and 3.0 for the biopsy. Thirty-one patients (67.4%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with 18 having a Gleason score ≥ 7. Compared to baseline, no adverse changes in IPSS, Rectal Function Assessment Score, International Index of Erectile Function, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, or postvoid residual were detected at day 30.

Growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), plays a role in tumor progression by regulating growth in many cancers. Here, we explored how GAS6 regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis of PCa cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that GAS6 is sufficient to significantly increase the fraction of cells in G1 and the duration of phase in PCa cells. Importantly, the effect of GAS6 on G1 is potentiated during docetaxel chemotherapy. GAS6 altered the levels of several key cell cycle regulators, including the downregulation of Cyclin B1 (G2 /M phase), CDC25A, Cyclin E1, and CDK2 (S phase entry), while the upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21, Cyclin D1, and CDK4. Importantly, these changes became further accentuated during docetaxel treatment in the presence of GAS6. Moreover, GAS6 alters the apoptotic response of PCa cells during docetaxel chemotherapy. Docetaxel induced PCa cell apoptosis is efficiently suppressed in PCa cell culture in the presence of GAS6 or GAS6 secreted from co-cultured osteoblasts. Similarly, the GAS6-expressing bone environment protects PCa cells from apoptosis within primary tumors in vivo studies. Docetaxel induced significant levels of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in PCa cells, while GAS6 protected PCa cells from docetaxel-induced apoptotic signaling. Together, these data suggest that GAS6, expressed by osteoblasts in the bone marrow, plays a significant role in the regulation of PCa cell survival during chemotherapy, which will have important implications for targeting metastatic disease.

Experimental identification of disease-related miRNAs is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Hence, there is a stressing need to propose efficient computational methods to detect more potential miRNA-disease associations. Currently, several computational approaches for identifying disease-related miRNAs on the miRNA-disease network have gained much attention by means of integrating miRNA functional similarities and disease semantic similarities. However, these methods rarely consider the network topological similarity of the miRNA-disease association network. Here, in this paper we develop an improved computational method named NTSMDA that is based on known miRNA-disease network topological similarity to exploit more potential disease-related miRNAs. We achieve an AUC of 89.4% by using the leave-one-out cross-validation experiment, demonstrating the excellent predictive performance of NTSMDA. Furthermore, predicted highly ranked miRNA-disease associations of breast neoplasms, lung neoplasms and prostatic neoplasms are manually confirmed by different related databases and literature, providing evidence for the good performance and potential value of the NTSMDA method in inferring miRNA-disease associations.

However, the role of exosomes and membrane-associated receptors, particularly epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as mediators of cell proliferation and invasion in PCa progression remains unexplored. EGFR is frequently overexpressed and has been associated with aggressive forms of PCa. While PCa cells and tissues express EGFR, it is unknown whether exosomes derived from PCa cells or PCa patient serum contains EGFR. The aim of this study was to detect and characterize EGFR in exosomes derived from PCa cells, LNCaP xenograft and PCa patient serum. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media of different PCa cell lines; LNCaP xenograft serum as well as patient plasma/serum by differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation on a sucrose density gradient. Exosomes were confirmed by electron microscopy, expression of exosomal markers and NanoSight™ analysis. EGFR expression was determined by western blot analysis and ELISA. This study demonstrates that exosomes may easily be derived from PCa cell lines, serum obtained from PCa xenograft bearing mice and clinical samples derived from PCa patients. Presence of exosomal EGFR in PCa patient exosomes may present a novel approach for measuring of the disease state.

The use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for screening in the general population has limitations and is not currently advocated. Approximately 100 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified that are associated with the risk of developing PrCa. The PROFILE pilot study explored the feasibility of using SNP profiling in men with a family history (FH) of PrCa to investigate the probability of detecting PrCa at prostate biopsy (PB). The primary aim of this pilot study was to determine the safety and feasibility of PrCa screening using transrectal ultrasound-guided PB with or without diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in men with a FH. A secondary aim was to evaluate the potential use of SNP profiling as a screening tool in this population.  Patients and methods:   A total of 100 men aged 40-69 years with a FH of PrCa underwent PB, regardless of their baseline PSA level. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated for each participant using 71 common PrCa susceptibility alleles. We treated the disease outcome at PB as the outcome variable and evaluated its associations with the PRS, PSA level, and DW-MRI findings using univariate logistic regression.  Results:   Of the 100 men, 25 were diagnosed with PrCa, of whom 12 (48%) had clinically significant disease. Four adverse events occurred and no deaths. The PSA level and age at study entry were associated with PrCa at PB (p = .00037 and p = .00004, respectively).  Conclusion:   The results of the present pilot study have demonstrated that PB is a feasible and safe method of PrCa screening in men with a FH, with a high proportion of PrCa identified requiring radical treatment. It is feasible to collect data on PrCa-risk SNPs to evaluate their combined effect as a potential screening tool. A larger prospective study powered to detect statistical associations is in progress.  Implications for practice:   Prostate biopsy is a feasible and safe approach to prostate cancer screening in men with a family history and detects a high proportion of prostate cancer that needs radical treatment. Calculating a polygenic risk score using prostate cancer risk single nucleotide polymorphisms could be a potential future screening tool for prostate cancer.""","""['Elena Castro', 'Christos Mikropoulos', 'Elizabeth K Bancroft', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Chee Goh', 'Natalie Taylor', 'Edward Saunders', 'Nigel Borley', 'Diana Keating', 'Elizabeth C Page', 'Sibel Saya', 'Stephen Hazell', 'Naomi Livni', 'Nandita deSouza', 'David Neal', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Pardeep Kumar', 'Antonis C Antoniou', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai;PROFILE Study Steering Committee;Rosalind A Eeles']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['The BARCODE1 Pilot: a feasibility study of using germline single nucleotide polymorphisms to target prostate cancer screening.', 'Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'Prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E germline mutation in British men and correlation with prostate cancer risk, tumour characteristics and clinical outcomes.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Prostate cancer risk in men of differing genetic ancestry and approaches to disease screening and management in these groups.', 'Updates in Prostate Cancer Research and Screening in Men at Genetically Higher Risk.', 'Breast and Prostate Cancer Risks for Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Variant Carriers Using Polygenic Risk Scores.', 'The BARCODE1 Pilot: a feasibility study of using germline single nucleotide polymorphisms to target prostate cancer screening.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer: an update.']"""

We sought to define CAM use by cancer patients and investigate factors that might influence changes in CAM use in relation to cancer diagnoses.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer between 2010 and 2012 at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Questionnaires were sent to 1794 patients. Phone calls were made to nonrespondents. Log binomial/Poisson regressions were used to investigate the association between cancer-related changes in CAM use and conversations about CAM use with oncology providers.  Results:   We received 603 (33.6 %) completed questionnaires. The mean age (SD) was 64 (11) years; 62% were female; 79% were white; and 98% were non-Hispanic. Respondents reported the following cancer types: breast (47%), prostate (27%), colorectal (14%), lung (11%). Eighty-nine percent reported lifetime CAM use. Eighty-five percent reported CAM use during or after initial cancer treatment, with category-specific use as follows: mind-body medicine 39%, dietary supplements 73%, body-based therapies 30%, and energy medicine 49%. During treatment CAM use decreased for all categories except energy medicine. After treatment CAM use returned to pretreatment levels for most CAMs except chiropractic. Initiation of CAM use after cancer diagnosis was positively associated with a patient having a conversation about CAM use with their oncology provider, mainly driven by patient-initiated conversations.  Conclusions:   Consistent with previous studies, CAM use was common among our study population.

Paraffin sections from xenograft tumor specimens were used in the TUNEL (terminal deocynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assay and an immunohistochemistry assay to detect cell proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA. Lavender essential oil, linalool, and linalyl acetate showed stronger inhibitory effect on PC-3 cells than on DU145 cells. The apoptotic cell populations observed in PC-3 cells treated with lavender essential oil, linalool, and linalyl acetate were 74.76%, 67.11%, and 56.14%, respectively. The PC-3 cells were mainly arrested in the G2/M phase. In the xenograft model with PC-3 cell transplantation, essential oil and linalool significantly suppressed tumor growth. The immunosignals of Ki67 and PCNA in the essential oil, linalool, and linalyl acetate treatment groups were significantly lower than that of the control group in xenograft tumor sections. The TUNEL assay indicated that each of the 3 phytochemicals significantly induced apoptosis compared to the control group.

We aimed to determine the clinical significance of early PSA response (EPR) during therapy with enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate (AA) and orteronel in mCRPC.  Methods:   Data from patients recruited in clinical trials were studied. PSA values were obtained at baseline and 28 d after treatment initiation. EPR defined as a decline >50% from baseline was calculated according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria. The effects of clinical characteristics on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using the Cox model.  Results:   EPR was assessed in 118 patients treated in clinical trials and was found to be associated with longer rPFS and OS (P < 0.0001 for both). Median rPFS was 13.9 and 5.6 months (hazard ratio [HR]:0.38, P < 0.001) for patients with and without an EPR, respectively. Median OS was 32.2 months in patients with an EPR and 15.9 months in patients without an EPR (HR: 0.4, P < 0.01). EPR remained prognostic for OS in multivariate analyses (HR: 0.5, p=0.009) that included validated pre-therapeutic prognostic factors for mCRPC. Prognostic values of EPR for rPFS and OS were confirmed in an independent cohort of 95 AA-treated non-trial patients.

This study investigated whether natural products green tea (GT) and quercetin (Q) enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Doc in CRPC in mouse models.  Methods:   Male severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (n = 10 per group) were inoculated with androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells subcutaneously. When tumors were established the intervention started. Mice were administered with GT + Q, Doc 5 mg/kg (LD), GT + Q + LD Doc, Doc 10 mg/kg (HD) or control. The concentration of GT polyphenols in brewed tea administered as drinking water was 0.07% and Q was supplemented in diet at 0.4%. Doc was intravenously injected weekly for 4 weeks, GT and Q given throughout the study.  Results:   GT + Q or LD Doc slightly inhibited tumor growth compared to control. However, the combination of GT and Q with LD Doc significantly enhanced the potency of Doc 2-fold and reduced tumor growth by 62% compared to LD Doc in 7-weeks intervention. A decrease of Ki67 and increase of cleaved caspase 7 were observed in tumors by the mixture, along with lowered blood concentrations of growth factors like VEGF and EGF.

The variations may serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to allow for more individualized therapy.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 832 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the OmniExpress genotyping platform (Illumina®) in the boundaries of 61 candidate genes reported to be involved in the androgen metabolic pathway. The purpose was to investigate them for an association with time to treatment failure in 68 white men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer undergoing treatment with abiraterone acetate. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used with Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation as covariates. Each single nucleotide polymorphism was assessed using an allele carriage genetic model in which carriage of 1 or more minor alleles contributes to increased risk. Subset analyses were done to determine whether metastasis site, or prior treatment with ketoconazole or docetaxel would interact with the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated.  Results:   Six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the estrogen sulfotransferase gene SULT1E1 were associated with time to treatment failure on abiraterone acetate therapy after false discovery rate (q value) correction for multiple testing while controlling for Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation (q <0.05).

These side effects are due to procedure related effects on adjacent structures including blood vessels, bowel, urethra and/or neurovascular bundle. Ablation with irreversible electroporation (IRE) has shown to be effective and safe in destroying PCa cells and also has the potential advantage of sparing surrounding tissue and vital structures, resulting in less impaired functional outcomes and maintaining men's quality of life.  Methods/design:   In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) on IRE in localized PCa, 200 patients with organ-confined, unilateral (T1c-T2b) low- to intermediate-risk PCa (Gleason sum score 6 and 7) on transperineal template-mapping biopsies (TTMB) will be included. Patients will be randomized into focal or extended ablation of cancer foci with IRE. Oncological efficacy will be determined by multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound imaging if available, TTMP and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) follow-up. Patients will be evaluated up to 5 years on functional outcomes and quality of life with the use of standardized questionnaires.  Discussion:   There is critical need of larger, standardized RCTs evaluating long-term oncological and functional outcomes before introducing IRE and other focal therapy modalities as an accepted and safe therapeutic option for PCa. This RCT will provide important short- and long-term data and elucidates the differences between focal or extended ablation of localized, unilateral low- to intermediate-risk PCa with IRE.

Data from the Oncomine database showed that PTGR1 is commonly upregulated in PC tissue in comparison to corresponding normal controls. Two PTGR1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences were used to block the expression of PTGR1 via a lentivirus-mediated system in the androgen-independent PC cell lines DU145 and PC 3. Functional analysis revealed that knockdown of PTGR1 significantly inhibited proliferation and colony formation by PC cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation was related to arrest of the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and increased apoptosis in response to PTGR1 knockdown as indicated by flow cytometry.

We describe 4 patients with paraneoplastic scleroderma who were treated at the I. Department of Dermatovenereology, St. Anna Hospital, during the period between 2004 and 2014. The patients were diagnosed with cholangiogenic carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma, and adenoma of the suprarenal gland. In the case of concurrent scleroderma and tumor, four situations may occur: they can develop independently of each other; scleroderma may be induced by the tumor; the tumor can develop in the scleroderma; or the tumor can be induced by immunosuppressive therapy. Sclerotization of the skin was described in association with lung cancer, carcinoid, plasma cell dyscrasia, cancer of the ovary, cervix, breast, esophagus, stomach, nasopharynx, melanoma, and sarcoma (1,2,5,7,10). Symptoms may be induced by substances secreted by the tumor (hormones, cytokines, etc.) (9). Tumorous cells further induce cytotoxic and autoantibody response. Scleroderma is characterized by immunological dysregulation, vasculopathy, and hyperproduction of the extracellular matrix by activated fibroblasts. Endothelial, inflammatory, and mesenchymal cells produce cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors e.g. Interleukin-1 (IL1), Interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α), collagen alpha 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (3), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). This factor is also produced by lung cancer cells (4). The clinical picture of scleroderma and paraneoplastic scleroderma is similar. Diffuse thickening of the skin and/or sclerodermatous plaques can be seen. The histological picture is consistent with scleroderma. Capillaroscopy changes, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), sclerodactyly, and Raynaud phenomenon suggest the diagnosis of systemic scleroderma (SS) (4). Our patients did not fulfill enough of the criteria for SS. Both diffuse and localized scleroderma was seen in 3 patients and generalized localized scleroderma in one case. All patients had a histological picture consistent with scleroderma, negative ANA and ENA antibodies (Table 1, Figure 1). A 66-year-old woman presented with a 10 months history of sclerodermatous plaques on her neck, trunk, and upper and lower extremities. The skin on her breasts and cheeks was diffusely indurated. Examination showed thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, Cancer antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, dysmotility of the lower part of esophagus, hepatosplenomegaly, cholecystolithiasis, and benign polyps of colon. She was given prednisone 40 mg/day but did not return for follow up. After 6 months she was diagnosed with cholangiogenic carcinoma with metastatic disease and died shortly afterwards. A 74-year-old woman had localized scleroderma on the trunk for three years. She was treated with procaine penicillin for positive borrelia Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Her condition worsened suddenly with confluent scleroderma plaques on her trunk, extremities, and genital region, and vasoneurosis on her lower extremities; she was started on prednisone 35 mg/day. Examination revealed endometrial cancer. The patient underwent a hysterectomy, adnexectomy, and radiotherapy with curative effect. Scleroderma patches softened with residual hyperpigmentation, and prednisone was stopped two years later. A 80-year-old man had a month-long history of diffuse thickening and toughening of the skin on the forearms and lower legs and scleroderma patches on the thighs and shins. Examination revealed prostate adenocarcinoma, and therapy with antiandrogen bicalutamide and prednisone 15 mg/day was started. Two years after the diagnosis he continues with bicalutamide treatment, prednisone 5 mg q.a.d. and has residual toughening of the skin on his lower legs. A 62-year-old woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with diffusely tough skin on her extremities and trunk, present for 2 months. Examination revealed cervicitis with a benign endometric polyp, cholecystolithiasis, borderline pulmonary hypertension, and a hormonally inactive suprarenal adenoma. She was given prednisone 40 mg/day and penicillamine with effect. In the 3rd year of therapy she has residual induration of her lower legs and a scleroderma plaque in the lumbar region. She is monitored for her suprarenal adenoma. Two patients had scleroderma at the same time as a malignant tumor; in one patient the localized scleroderma worsened rapidly at the time of the tumor diagnosis, and in one patient a clinically silent adenoma was found. Adrenal tissue can secrete molecules such as serotonine or bFGF involved in fibroplasia (3,6). One patient died of a metastatic disease, two patients after the successful treatment of the tumor, and the patient with suprarenal adenoma experienced softening of the skin and regression of scleroderma. Although paraneoplastic scleroderma is often classified as a pseudoscleroderma, we regard neoplasia as a distinct triggering impulse for scleroderma. Recently, an association between RNA polymerase I/III antibodies in systemic scleroderma and cancer was suggested (8). Such studies may confirm the true link between scleroderma and malignancy. These patients are characterized by older age, sudden onset, diffuse thickening of the skin, and/or generalized morphea with a concurrent neoplastic process. In the case of a successful tumor treatment, skin changes regress.""","""['Hana Jedlickova', 'Veronika Durčanská', 'Vladimír Vašků']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Dermatovenerol Croat""","""['Trichotillomania: Bizzare Patern of Hair Loss at 11-Year-old Girl.', 'Generalized Pyoderma Gangrenosum Associated with Ulcerative Colitis: Successful Treatment with Infliximab and Azathioprine.', 'Folliculotropic Cutaneous Metastases and Lymphangitis Carcinomatosa: When Cutaneous Metastases of Breast Carcinoma Are Mistaken for Cutaneous Infections.', 'Paraneoplastic Encephalopathy in a Patient With Metastatic Lung Cancer: A Case Study.', 'Paraneoplastic systemic sclerosis: About 3 cases and review of literature.', 'A case of nivolumab-induced scleroderma-like syndrome successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.', 'CAN SKIN BE A MARKER FOR INTERNAL MALIGNANCY?

We herein identified 11 novel resveratrol-binding proteins, including the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box helicase 5 (DDX5, also known as p68), using resveratrol-immobilized beads.

However, it is not clear how interactions between cancer cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), especially within hypoxic microenvironments, affect the invasion of cancer cells. Here, using an MR compatible cell perfusion assay, we investigated the role of LEC-prostate cancer (PCa) cell interaction in the invasion and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by two human PCa cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, under normoxia and hypoxia, and determined the metabolic changes that occurred under these conditions. We observed a significant increase in the invasion of ECM by invasive PC-3 cells, but not poorly invasive DU-145 cells when human dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dlys) were present. Enhanced degradation of ECM by PC-3 cells in the presence of HMVEC-dlys identified interactions between HMVEC-dlys and PCa cells influencing cancer cell invasion. The enhanced ECM degradation was partly attributed to increased MMP-9 enzymatic activity in PC-3 cells when HMVEC-dlys were in close proximity. Significantly higher uPAR and MMP-9 expression levels observed in PC-3 cells compared to DU-145 cells may be one mechanism for increased invasion and degradation of matrigel by these cells irrespective of the presence of HMVEC-dlys. Hypoxia significantly decreased invasion by PC-3 cells, but this decrease was significantly attenuated when HMVEC-dlys were present. Significantly higher phosphocholine was observed in invasive PC-3 cells, while higher glycerophosphocholine was observed in DU-145 cells. These metabolites were not altered in the presence of HMVEC-dlys. Significantly increased lipid levels and lipid droplets were observed in PC-3 and DU-145 cells under hypoxia reflecting an adaptive survival response to oxidative stress. These results suggest that in vivo, invasive cells in or near lymphatic endothelial cells are likely to be more invasive and degrade the ECM to influence the metastatic cascade.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the optimal exposure timing and mechanism of action remain unclear. In the current study, the authors investigated associations between prediagnostic aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality in a US population.  Methods:   Postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer (1993-2009) were identified (2925 women with a total of 18,073 person-years) from the National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Prediagnostic aspirin use (1274 women) was identified from study questionnaires. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality. Effect modification by lymph node status was evaluated.  Results:   Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68-1.31 [P = .74]). In analyses stratified by lymph node status, aspirin use was found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality among women with lymph node-negative tumors (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93 [P = 0.02]), but not those with lymph node-positive tumors (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92-2.16 [P = 0.11]). Tests for interaction were found to be statistically significant (P for interaction =.006). No association was noted between aspirin use and lymph node status.  Conclusions:   Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality overall. However, effect modification by lymph node status was observed and mortality was found to be reduced by approximately one-half among aspirin users with lymph node-negative disease. This represents a clinically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. These findings contribute to the understanding of aspirin's mechanism of action in breast cancer. However, further etiologic research to understand this association is warranted.

The use of a mechanistic model predicts that biological quantities that cannot be observed, such as treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cells, may have a larger impact than PSA value on survival.

In this report, we show that the N-terminus of CSR1 interacts with splicing factor 3A, subunit 3 (SF3A3). The SF3A3 binding motif was identified in the region of amino acids 62-91 of CSR1 through cell-free binding analyses. The interaction between CSR1 and SF3A3 led to migration of SF3A3 from nucleus to cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic redistribution of SF3A3 significantly reduced the splicing efficiency of epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Induction of CSR1 or down-regulation of SF3A3 also significantly reduced the splicing activity of oxytocin reporter gene both in vivo and in vitro. Mutant CSR1 that lacks the SF3A3 binding motif contained no RNA splicing regulatory activity, while the peptide corresponding to the SF3A3 binding motif in CSR1 interfered with the wild-type CSR1 mediated inhibition of RNA splicing.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for practical biomarkers to guide therapy selection and elucidate resistance. Although tissue biopsies are impractical to perform routinely in the majority of patients with mCRPC, the analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has recently emerged as a minimally invasive method to explore tumor characteristics.  Objective:   To reveal genomic characteristics from cfDNA associated with clinical outcomes during enzalutamide treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   Plasma samples were obtained from August 4, 2013, to July 31, 2015, at a single academic institution (British Columbia Cancer Agency) from 65 patients with mCRPC. We collected temporal plasma samples (at baseline, 12 weeks, end of treatment) for circulating cfDNA and performed array comparative genomic hybridization copy number profiling and deep AR gene sequencing. Samples collected at end of treatment were also subjected to targeted sequencing of 19 prostate cancer-associated genes.  Exposure:   Enzalutamide, 160 mg, daily orally.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate-specific antigen response rate (decline ≥50% from baseline confirmed ≥3 weeks later). Radiographic (as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 Criteria) and/or clinical progression (defined as worsening disease-related symptoms necessitating a change in anticancer therapy and/or deterioration in Eastern Cooperative Group performance status ≥2 levels).  Results:   The 65 patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 74 (68-79) years. Prostate-specific antigen response rate to enzalutamide treatment was 38% (25 of 65), while median clinical/radiographic progression-free survival was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.1-5.0) months. Cell-free DNA was isolated from 122 of 125 plasma samples, and targeted sequencing was successful in 119 of 122. AR mutations and/or copy number alterations were robustly detected in 48% (31 of 65) and 60% (18 of 30) of baseline and progression samples, respectively. Detection of AR amplification, heavily mutated AR (≥2 mutations), and RB1 loss were associated with worse progression-free survival, with hazard ratios of 2.92 (95% CI, 1.59-5.37), 3.94 (95% CI, 1.46-10.64), and 4.46 (95% CI, 2.28-8.74), respectively. AR mutations exhibited clonal selection during treatment, including an increase in glucocorticoid-sensitive AR L702H and promiscuous AR T878A in patients with prior abiraterone treatment.

Methods:   Data came from patients with advanced cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate) and their family caregivers (N = 484 dyads). Study hypotheses were examined with structural equation modeling using the actor-partner interdependence mediation model. Bootstrapping and model constraints were used to test indirect effects suggested by the mediation models. An interaction term was added to the standard actor-partner interdependence model to test for moderation effects.  Results:   More patient comorbidities were associated with lower patient QOL. More caregiver chronic conditions were associated with lower patient and caregiver QOL. Patient comorbidities and caregiver chronic conditions had a negative influence on caregiver meaning-based coping but no significant influence on patient meaning based coping. Caregiver meaning-based coping mediated relationships between patient comorbidities and caregiver health conditions and patient and caregiver QOL. No significant moderating effects were observed.  Conclusions:   Despite the severity of advanced cancer for patients and caregivers, the co-existing health problems of one member of the dyad have the potential to directly or indirectly affect the wellbeing of the other.

Methods:   The proposed MAR algorithm followed a four-step procedure. The first step involved applying a weighted blend of both DECT scans (I H/L) to generate a new image (I Mix). This action minimized Hounsfield unit (HU) variations surrounding the brachytherapy seeds. In the second step, the mean HU of the prostate in I Mix was calculated and shifted toward the mean HU of the two original DECT images (I H/L). The third step involved smoothing the newly shifted I Mix and the two original I H/L, followed by a subtraction of both, generating an image that represented the metallic artifact (I A,(H/L)) of reduced noise levels. The final step consisted of subtracting the original I H/L from the newly generated I A,(H/L) and obtaining a final image corrected for metallic artifacts. Following the completion of the algorithm, a DECT stoichiometric method was used to extract the relative electronic density (ρe) and effective atomic number (Z eff) at each voxel of the corrected scans. Tissue assignment could then be determined with these two newly acquired physical parameters. Each voxel was assigned the tissue bearing the closest resemblance in terms of ρe and Z eff, comparing with values from the ICRU 42 database. A MC study was then performed to compare the dosimetric impacts of alternative MAR algorithms.  Results:   An improvement in tissue assignment was observed with the DECT MAR algorithm, compared to the single-energy computed tomography (SECT) approach. In a phantom study, tissue misassignment was found to reach 0.05% of voxels using the DECT approach, compared with 0.40% using the SECT method. Comparison of the DECT and SECT D 90 dose parameter (volume receiving 90% of the dose) indicated that D 90 could be underestimated by up to 2.3% using the SECT method.  Conclusions:   The DECT MAR approach is a simple alternative to reduce metallic artifacts found in LDRB patient scans. Images can be processed quickly and do not require the determination of x-ray spectra. Substantial information on density and atomic number can also be obtained. Furthermore, calcifications within the prostate are detected by the tissue assignment algorithm.

Methods:   The authors implemented both stereoscopic and monoscopic fiducial localizations using a room-mounted dual oblique x-ray system. Recently developed monoscopic 3D position estimation techniques potentially overcome the issue of treatment head interference with stereoscopic imaging at certain gantry angles. To demonstrate continuous position monitoring, a gold fiducial marker was placed in an anthropomorphic phantom and placed on the Linac couch. The couch was used as a programmable translation stage. The couch was programmed with a series of patient prostate motion trajectories exemplifying five distinct categories: stable prostate, slow drift, persistent excursion, transient excursion, and high frequency excursions. The phantom and fiducial were imaged using 140 kVp, 0.63 mAs per image at 1 Hz for a 60 s monitoring period. Both stereoscopic and monoscopic 3D localization accuracies were assessed by comparison to the ground-truth obtained from the Linac log file. Imaging dose was also assessed, using optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter inserts in the phantom.  Results:   Stereoscopic localization accuracy varied between 0.13 ± 0.05 and 0.33 ± 0.30 mm, depending on the motion trajectory. Monoscopic localization accuracy varied from 0.2 ± 0.1 to 1.1 ± 0.7 mm. The largest localization errors were typically observed in the left-right direction. There were significant differences in accuracy between the two monoscopic views, but which view was better varied from trajectory to trajectory. The imaging dose was measured to be between 2 and 15 μGy/mAs, depending on location in the phantom.  Conclusions:   The authors have demonstrated the first use of monoscopic localization for a room-mounted dual x-ray system. Three-dimensional position estimation from monoscopic imaging permits continuous, uninterrupted intrafraction motion monitoring even in the presence of gantry rotation, which may block kV sources or imagers.

A technique is required to monitor the treatment as it is delivered, allowing comparison with the treatment plan and error detection. In this work, we demonstrate a method for monitoring the treatment as it is delivered and directly comparing the delivered treatment with the treatment plan in the clinical workspace. This treatment verification system is based on a flat panel detector (FPD) used for both pre-treatment imaging and source tracking.  Methods:   A phantom study was conducted to establish the resolution and precision of the system. A pretreatment radiograph of a phantom containing brachytherapy catheters is acquired and registration between the measurement and treatment planning system (TPS) is performed using implanted fiducial markers. The measured catheter paths immediately prior to treatment were then compared with the plan. During treatment delivery, the position of the (192)Ir source is determined at each dwell position by measuring the exit radiation with the FPD and directly compared to the planned source dwell positions.  Results:   The registration between the two corresponding sets of fiducial markers in the TPS and radiograph yielded a registration error (residual) of 1.0 mm. The measured catheter paths agreed with the planned catheter paths on average to within 0.5 mm. The source positions measured with the FPD matched the planned source positions for all dwells on average within 0.6 mm (s.d. 0.3, min. 0.1, max. 1.4 mm).  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated a method for directly comparing the treatment plan with the delivered treatment that can be easily implemented in the clinical workspace. Pretreatment imaging was performed, enabling visualization of the implant before treatment delivery and identification of possible catheter displacement. Treatment delivery verification was performed by measuring the source position as each dwell was delivered.

So far, couch and MLC tracking experiments have mainly been performed by different research groups, and no direct comparison of couch and MLC tracking of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans has been published. The Varian TrueBeam 2.0 accelerator includes a prototype tracking system with selectable couch or MLC compensation. This study provides a direct comparison of the two tracking types with an otherwise identical setup.  Methods:   Several experiments were performed to characterize the geometric and dosimetric performance of electromagnetic guided couch and MLC tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator equipped with a Millennium MLC. The tracking system latency was determined without motion prediction as the time lag between sinusoidal target motion and the compensating motion of the couch or MLC as recorded by continuous MV portal imaging. The geometric and dosimetric tracking accuracies were measured in tracking experiments with motion phantoms that reproduced four prostate and four lung tumor trajectories. The geometric tracking error in beam's eye view was determined as the distance between an embedded gold marker and a circular MLC aperture in continuous MV images. The dosimetric tracking error was quantified as the measured 2%/2 mm gamma failure rate of a low and a high modulation VMAT plan delivered with the eight motion trajectories using a static dose distribution as reference.  Results:   The MLC tracking latency was approximately 146 ms for all sinusoidal period lengths while the couch tracking latency increased from 187 to 246 ms with decreasing period length due to limitations in the couch acceleration. The mean root-mean-square geometric error was 0.80 mm (couch tracking), 0.52 mm (MLC tracking), and 2.75 mm (no tracking) parallel to the MLC leaves and 0.66 mm (couch), 1.14 mm (MLC), and 2.41 mm (no tracking) perpendicular to the leaves. The motion-induced gamma failure rate was in mean 0.1% (couch tracking), 8.1% (MLC tracking), and 30.4% (no tracking) for prostate motion and 2.9% (couch), 2.4% (MLC), and 41.2% (no tracking) for lung tumor motion. The residual tracking errors were mainly caused by inadequate adaptation to fast lung tumor motion for couch tracking and to prostate motion perpendicular to the MLC leaves for MLC tracking.  Conclusions:   Couch and MLC tracking markedly improved the geometric and dosimetric accuracies of VMAT delivery. However, the two tracking types have different strengths and weaknesses. While couch tracking can correct perfectly for slowly moving targets such as the prostate, MLC tracking may have considerably larger dose errors for persistent target shift perpendicular to the MLC leaves. Advantages of MLC tracking include faster dynamics with better adaptation to fast moving targets, the avoidance of moving the patient, and the potential to track target rotations and deformations.""","""['Rune Hansen', 'Thomas Ravkilde', 'Esben Schjødt Worm', 'Jakob Toftegaard', 'Cai Grau', 'Kristijan Macek', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Couch and multileaf collimator tracking: A clinical feasibility study for pancreas and liver treatment.', 'An experimentally validated couch and MLC tracking simulator used to investigate hybrid couch-MLC tracking.', 'Time-resolved dose distributions to moving targets during volumetric modulated arc therapy with and without dynamic MLC tracking.', 'A review of progress of real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy technology based on dynamic multi-leaf collimator.', 'Motion compensation in radiotherapy.', 'Ultrasound Imaging with Flexible Array Transducer for Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Real-Time Respiratory Tumor Motion Prediction Based on a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network: Prediction Model Development Study.', 'The potential of Gantry beamline large momentum acceptance for real time tumour tracking in pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Couch and multileaf collimator tracking: A clinical feasibility study for pancreas and liver treatment.']"""

One challenge with an MRI-alone workflow is the accurate identification of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers, which are frequently used for prostate localization prior to each dose delivery fraction. This paper investigates a template-matching approach for the detection of these seeds in MRI.  Methods:   Two different gradient echo T1 and T2* weighted MRI sequences were acquired from fifteen prostate cancer patients and evaluated for seed detection. For training, seed templates from manual contours were selected in a spectral clustering manifold learning framework. This aids in clustering ""similar"" gold fiducial markers together. The marker with the minimum distance to a cluster centroid was selected as the representative template of that cluster during training. During testing, Gaussian mixture modeling followed by a Markovian model was used in automatic detection of the probable candidates. The probable candidates were rigidly registered to the templates identified from spectral clustering, and a similarity metric is computed for ranking and detection.  Results:   A fiducial detection accuracy of 95% was obtained compared to manual observations. Expert radiation therapist observers were able to correctly identify all three implanted seeds on 11 of the 15 scans (the proposed method correctly identified all seeds on 10 of the 15).  Conclusions:   An novel automatic framework for gold fiducial marker detection in MRI is proposed and evaluated with detection accuracies comparable to manual detection. When radiation therapists are unable to determine the seed location in MRI, they refer back to the planning CT (only available in the existing clinical framework); similarly, an automatic quality control is built into the automatic software to ensure that all gold seeds are either correctly detected or a warning is raised for further manual intervention.""","""['Soumya Ghose', 'Jhimli Mitra', 'David Rivest-Hénault', 'Amir Fazlollahi', 'Peter Stanwell', 'Peter Pichler', 'Jidi Sun', 'Jurgen Fripp', 'Peter B Greer', 'Jason A Dowling']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'A generative adversarial network-based (GAN-based) architecture for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI-only radiotherapy simulation images.', 'Registration free automatic identification of gold fiducial markers in MRI target delineation images for prostate radiotherapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', '3D reconstruction of skin and spatial mapping of immune cell density, vascular distance and effects of sun exposure and aging.', 'Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'MR-PROTECT: Clinical feasibility of a prostate MRI-only radiotherapy treatment workflow and investigation of acceptance criteria.', 'A Multi-center Prospective Study for Implementation of an MRI-Only Prostate Treatment Planning Workflow.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.']"""

For these plans geometric tracking and dosimetric tracking were evaluated by ionization chamber (IC) point dose measurements (zero-D) and measurements using a stack of EBT3 films (3D). The geometric tracking applied translations, rotations, and scaling of the MLC aperture in response to realistic prostate motions. The dosimetric tracking additionally corrected the monitor units to resolve variations due to difference in depth, tissue heterogeneity, and MLC-aperture. The tracking was based on the positions of four fiducial points only. The film measurements were compared to the gold standard (i.e., IC measurements) and the planned dose distribution. Additionally, the 3D measurements were converted to dose volume histograms, tumor control probability, and normal tissue complication probability parameters (DVH/TCP/NTCP) as a direct estimate of clinical relevance of the proposed tracking.  Results:   Compared to the planned dose distribution, measurements without prostate motion and tracking showed already a reduced homogeneity of the dose distribution. Adding prostate motion further blurs the DVHs for all treatment approaches. The clinical practice (no tracking) delivered the dose distribution inside the PTV but off target (CTV), resulting in boost dose errors up to 10%. The geometric and dosimetric tracking corrected the dose distribution's position. Moreover, the dosimetric tracking could achieve the planned boost DVH, but not the DVH of the more homogeneously irradiated prostate. A drawback of both the geometric and dosimetric tracking was a reduced MLC blocking caused by the rotational component of the MLC aperture corrections. Because of the used CTV to PTV margins and the high doses in the considered fractionation schemes, the TCP differed less than 0.02 from the planned value for all targets and all correction methods. The rectal NTCP constraints, however, could not be realized using any of these methods.  Conclusions:   The geometric and dosimetric tracking use only a limited input, but they deposit the dose distribution with higher geometric accuracy than the clinical practice. The latter case has boost dose errors up to 10%. The increased accuracy has a modest impact [Δ(NT)CP < 0.02] because of the applied margins and the high dose levels used. To allow further margin reduction tracking methods are vital. The proposed methodology could further be improved by implementing a rotational correction using collimator rotations.""","""['Wouter Crijns', 'Gilles Defraene', 'Hans Van Herck', 'Tom Depuydt', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Frederik Maes', 'Frank Van den Heuvel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Dosimetric adaptive IMRT driven by fiducial points.', 'Online adaptation and verification of VMAT.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Pre-treatment 2D and 3D dosimetric verification of volumetric arc therapy.

This work explores multiple statistical-learning strategies for prediction of urinary symptoms following external beam radiotherapy of the prostate.  Methods:   The performance of logistic regression, elastic-net, support-vector machine, random forest, neural network, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to predict urinary symptoms was analyzed using data from 754 participants accrued by TROG03.04-RADAR. Predictive features included dose-surface data, comorbidities, and medication-intake. Four symptoms were analyzed: dysuria, haematuria, incontinence, and frequency, each with three definitions (grade ≥ 1, grade ≥ 2 and longitudinal) with event rate between 2.3% and 76.1%. Repeated cross-validations producing matched models were implemented. A synthetic minority oversampling technique was utilized in endpoints with rare events. Parameter optimization was performed on the training data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to compare performance using sample size to detect differences of ≥0.05 at the 95% confidence level.  Results:   Logistic regression, elastic-net, random forest, MARS, and support-vector machine were the highest-performing statistical-learning strategies in 3, 3, 3, 2, and 1 endpoints, respectively. Logistic regression, MARS, elastic-net, random forest, neural network, and support-vector machine were the best, or were not significantly worse than the best, in 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, and 1 endpoints. The best-performing statistical model was for dysuria grade ≥ 1 with AUROC ± standard deviation of 0.649 ± 0.074 using MARS. For longitudinal frequency and dysuria grade ≥ 1, all strategies produced AUROC>0.6 while all haematuria endpoints and longitudinal incontinence models produced AUROC<0.6.  Conclusions:   Logistic regression and MARS were most likely to be the best-performing strategy for the prediction of urinary symptoms with elastic-net and random forest producing competitive results. The predictive power of the models was modest and endpoint-dependent. New features, including spatial dose maps, may be necessary to achieve better models.""","""['Noorazrul Yahya', 'Martin A Ebert', 'Max Bulsara', 'Michael J House', 'Angel Kennedy', 'David J Joseph', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Urinary symptoms following external beam radiotherapy of the prostate: Dose-symptom correlates with multiple-event and event-count models.', 'Comparison of statistical machine learning models for rectal protocol compliance in prostate external beam radiation therapy.', 'Late fecal incontinence after high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer: better prediction using longitudinal definitions.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'An extensive experimental survey of regression methods.', 'Derivation and Validation of a Simplified Clinical Prediction\xa0Rule\xa0for\xa0Identifying Children at Increased Risk\xa0for\xa0Clinically\xa0Important\xa0Traumatic\xa0Brain Injuries Following Minor\xa0Blunt\xa0Head Trauma.', 'Relative Performance of Machine Learning and Linear Regression in Predicting Quality of Life and Academic Performance of School Children in Norway: Data Analysis of a Quasi-Experimental Study.', 'Harnessing repeated measurements of predictor variables for clinical risk prediction: a review of existing methods.', 'Machine Learning-Based Models for Prediction of Toxicity Outcomes in Radiotherapy.', 'Machine Learning Models of Survival Prediction in Trauma Patients.']"""

The authors developed a plan optimization strategy to ensure clear visibility of implanted fiducials and facilitate 3D localization during volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).  Methods:   Periodic kilovoltage (kV) images were acquired at 20° gantry intervals and paired with simultaneously acquired 4.4° short arc megavoltage digital tomosynthesis (MV-DTS) to localize three fiducials during VMAT delivery for hypofractionated prostate cancer treatment. Beginning with the original optimized plan, control point segments where fiducials were consistently blocked by multileaf collimator (MLC) within each 4.4° MV-DTS interval were first identified. For each segment, MLC apertures were edited to expose the fiducial that led to the least increase in the cost function. Subsequently, MLC apertures of all control points not involved with fiducial visualization were reoptimized to compensate for plan quality losses and match the original dose-volume histogram. MV dose for each MV-DTS was also kept above 0.4 MU to ensure acceptable image quality. Different imaging (gantry) intervals and visibility margins around fiducials were also evaluated.  Results:   Fiducials were consistently blocked by the MLC for, on average, 36% of the imaging control points for five hypofractionated prostate VMAT plans but properly exposed after reoptimization. Reoptimization resulted in negligible dosimetric differences compared with original plans and outperformed simple aperture editing: on average, PTV D98 recovered from 87% to 94% of prescription, and PTV dose homogeneity improved from 9% to 7%. Without violating plan objectives and compromising delivery efficiency, the highest imaging frequency and largest margin that can be achieved are a 10° gantry interval, and 15 mm, respectively.  Conclusions:   VMAT plans can be made to accommodate MV-kV imaging of fiducials. Fiducial visualization rate and workflow efficiency are significantly improved with an automatic modification and reoptimization approach.""","""['Pengpeng Zhang', 'Laura Happersett', 'Bosky Ravindranath', 'Michael Zelefsky', 'Gig Mageras', 'Margie Hunt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous MV-kV imaging for intrafractional motion management during volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery.', 'Developing a MLC modifier program to improve fiducial detection for MV/kV imaging during hypofractionated prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Current modulated volume-of-interest imaging for kilovoltage intrafaction monitoring of the prostate.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: image guidance and adaptive therapy.', 'Markerless motion tracking with simultaneous MV and kV imaging in spine SBRT treatment-a feasibility study.', 'Retrospective analysis of MV-kV imaging-based fiducial tracking in prostate SBRT treatment.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Simultaneous MV-kV imaging for intrafractional motion management during volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery.']"""

Radiation oncology personnel's (ROP) opinion toward SBRT in the developing countries like India is unknown.  Subjects and methods:   A 30 question survey evaluating ROP's profile, technological details, and SBRT's perceptive were seeked. Tata Memorial Center - ROP's email database was used.  Results:   Survey questionnaire was emailed to 500 ROP's and 224 ROP's were contactable. Majority of the responders were from corporate hospitals and half of responders had experience of 5 or more years of experience in radiation oncology. SBRT was practiced by 70% of responders and the majority had adopted SBRT in 2010 or later. Quick turn around time, high dose delivery and competitive market forces were major factors to adopt SBRT. Lung was the most common site practiced followed by prostate, spine, and liver. All SBRT users were keen to increase SBRT in practice and the majority of non-responders were planning to adapt SBRT in the recent future. Almost half of SBRT users were willing to share data and expertise for training others. Lack of infrastructure was the prime reason for not practicing SBRT. ROP's perceived physics, radiobiology as the biggest challenge in SBRT. International collaboration may be helpful.  Conclusion:   Use of SBRT is expected to increase in India. Limited experience with lack of infrastructure in public funded centers is a major limitation. Unmet need of infrastructure, training and guidelines is enormous and formulation of Indian SBRT consortium will help reforming at all levels.""","""['S Rathod', 'A Munshi', 'J P Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Indian J Cancer""","""['A survey of the practice of stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular and pancreatic malignancies in India.', 'Definitive Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Extracranial Oligometastases: An International Survey of >1000 Radiation Oncologists.', 'The Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology scope of practice guidelines for lung, liver and spine stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Normal tissue toxicity after small field hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for genitourinary malignancies.', 'Practice Patterns and Perspectives on Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for the Metastatic Spine From Lower- and Middle-Income Countries.']"""

Patients with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (n = 325) or insufficient pathologic or follow-up data (n = 87) were excluded. The primary endpoint was the oncologic importance of LVI, and the secondary endpoint was the hierarchical relationships for estimating BCR between the evaluated variables. LVI was noted in 260 patients (21.5%) and was significantly associated with other adverse clinicopathologic features. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, LVI was significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR after adjusting for known prognostic factors. In the Bayesian belief network analysis, LVI and pathologic Gleason score were found to be first-degree associates of BCR, whereas prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, seminal vesicle invasion, perineural invasion, and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were considered second-degree associates. In the random survival forest, pathologic Gleason score, LVI, and PSA level were three most important variables in determining BCR of patients with pT3 N0 prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether digoxin use after diagnosis of prostate cancer was associated with decreased prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Methods:   A cohort of 13 134 patients with prostate cancer newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2009 was identified from English cancer registries and linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (to provide digoxin and other prescription records) and to the Office of National Statistics mortality data (to identify 2010 prostate cancer-specific deaths). Using time-dependent Cox regression models, unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the association between post-diagnostic exposure to digoxin and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Overall, 701 (5%) patients with prostate cancer used digoxin after diagnosis. Digoxin use was associated with an increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality before adjustment (HR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.32-1.91), but after adjustment for confounders, the association was attenuated (adjusted HR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.37) and there was no evidence of a dose response.

However, few studies have tested the diagnostic potential of EV analysis in humans.  Experimental design:   The ability of EV analysis to accurately reflect prostate tissue mRNA expression was examined by comparing urinary EV TMPRSS2:ERG exoRNA from pre-radical prostatectomy (RP) patients versus corresponding RP tissue in 21 patients. To examine the differential expression of TMPRSS2:ERG across patient groups a random urine sample was taken without prostate massage from a cohort of 207 men including prostate biopsy negative (Bx Neg, n = 39), prostate biopsy positive (Bx Pos, n = 47), post-radical prostatectomy (post-RP, n = 37), un-biopsied healthy age-matched men (No Bx, n = 44), and young male controls (Cont, n = 40). The use of EVs was also examined as a potential platform to non-invasively differentiate Bx Pos versus Bx Neg patients via the detection of known prostate cancer genes TMPRSS2:ERG, BIRC5, ERG, PCA3 and TMPRSS2.  Results:   In this technical pilot study urinary EVs had a sensitivity: 81% (13/16), specificity: 80% (4/5) and an overall accuracy: 81% (17/21) for non-invasive detection of TMPRSS2:ERG versus RP tissue. The rate of TMPRSS2:ERG exoRNA detection was found to increase with age and the expression level correlated with Bx Pos status. Receiver operator characteristic analyses demonstrated that various cancer-related genes could differentiate Bx Pos from Bx Neg patients using exoRNA isolated from urinary EVs: BIRC5 (AUC 0.674 (CI:0.560-0.788), ERG (AUC 0.785 (CI:0.680-0.890), PCA3 (AUC 0.681 (CI:0.567-0.795), TMPRSS2:ERG (AUC 0.744 (CI:0.600-0.888), and TMPRSS2 (AUC 0.637 (CI:0.519-0.754).

Specific signals for the expression of PSMA could be seen for different prostate cancer cell line cells (PC3, LaPC4, 22Rv1, and LNCaP) by Western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunocytochemistry (ICC), and FACS. PSMA expression was found to be significantly increased in patients with higher Gleason grade (p = 0.0011) and metastases in lymph nodes (p = 0.0000085) or bone (p = 0.0020) (cohort one). In cohort two, CTCs were detectable in 20 out of 29 samples (69 %, range from 1 - 1000 cells). Twelve out of 20 CTC-positive patients showed PSMA-positive CTCs (67 %, score 1+ to 3+). We found intra-patient heterogeneity regarding the PSMA status between CTCs and the corresponding primary tumors. The results of our study could help to address the question whether treatment decisions based on CTC PSMA profiling will lead to a measurable benefit in clinical outcome for prostate cancer patients in the near future.""","""['Tobias M Gorges', 'Sabine Riethdorf', 'Oliver von Ahsen', 'Paulina Nastał Y', 'Katharina Röck', 'Marcel Boede', 'Sven Peine', 'Andra Kuske', 'Elke Schmid', 'Christoph Kneip', 'Frank König', 'Marion Rudolph', 'Klaus Pantel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression as a predictor of prostate cancer progression.', 'The Use of a New CellCollector to Isolate Circulating Tumor Cells from the Blood of Patients with Different Stages of Prostate Cancer and Clinical Outcomes - A Proof-of-Concept Study.', 'Optimization and Evaluation of a Novel Size Based Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation System.', 'Clinical indications for, and the future of, circulating tumor cells.', 'The current role of circulating tumor cells in the diagnosis and management of bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Status of PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer: current data and future trials.', 'Multivalent effect of peptide functionalized polymeric nanoparticles towards selective prostate cancer targeting.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.', 'Circulating Exosome Cargoes Contain Functionally Diverse Cancer Biomarkers: From Biogenesis and Function to Purification and Potential Translational Utility.']"""

Methods:   Men were randomized to either mindfulness (n = 24) or an attention control arm (n = 19) and completed self-reported measures of prostate cancer anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, global quality of life, mindfulness and posttraumatic growth at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.  Results:   Participants in the mindfulness arm demonstrated significant decreases in prostate cancer anxiety and uncertainty intolerance, and significant increases in mindfulness, global mental health and posttraumatic growth. Participants in the control condition also demonstrated significant increases in mindfulness over time. Longitudinal increases in posttraumatic growth were significantly larger in the mindfulness arm than they were in the control arm.  Conclusions:   While mindfulness training was found to be generally feasible and acceptable among participants who enrolled in the 8-week intervention as determined by completion rates and open-ended survey responses, the response rate between initial enrollment and the total number of men approached was lower than desired (47%). While larger sample sizes are necessary to examine the efficacy of mindfulness training on important psychological outcomes, in this pilot study posttraumatic growth was shown to significantly increase over time for men in the treatment group. Mindfulness training has the potential to help men cope more effectively with some of the stressors and uncertainties associated with active surveillance.

Material and methods:   We enrolled 10 patients receiving PPRT in a prospective imaging study. All patients underwent combined computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulation with endorectal balloon (ERB) and received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) per institutional standards. Study patients underwent weekly MRI verification scans in the treatment position. Three radiation oncologists contoured clinical target volumes (CTV) on initial and verification scans using two consensus guidelines (RTOG and EORTC). We generated IMRT, double scattering (DS), and pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton plans and examined the dosimetric impact of contour variations, inter-fraction motion, and patient alignment techniques.  Results:   Inter-observer variations in contouring reduced median CTV coverage (D100) by 0.9% for IMRT plans, 2.8% for DS proton plans, 3.4-4.9% for PBS Proton Plans. Inter-fraction changes in target volumes due to internal organ motion resulted in a median loss of target dose coverage (D98) of 0% with IMRT, 3.5% with DS, and 8.1-8.3% with PBS. Median bladder V65Gy increased during the treatment course with all techniques (6.0-7.5%). Changes in the median rectal V60Gy remained small regardless of the treatment technique (0.5-3.1% increase). Alignment to the ERB after cranio-caudal bony alignment reduced CTV displacement compared to bony alignment alone, and as a result CTV coverage (D98) changed <2% with IMRT, DS, and PBS.  Conclusion:   Proton-based treatments are more sensitive to changes in inter-fraction organ motion during PPRT compared to IMRT, and therefore motion management and patient alignment methods are critical. Patient alignment using bony anatomy as well as the ERB minimizes displacement of the CTV, and reduces variation in target dose coverage particularly for PBS proton therapy.""","""['Samuel Swisher-McClure', 'Lingshu Yin', 'Mark Rosen', 'Sonny Batra', 'Abigail T Berman', 'Stefan Both', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Bag and loop small bowel contouring strategies differentially estimate small bowel dose for post-hysterectomy women receiving pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Impact of intrafraction and residual interfraction effect on prostate proton pencil beam scanning.', 'Degradation of target coverage due to inter-fraction motion during intensity-modulated proton therapy of prostate and elective targets.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care.']"""

The objectives of this analysis were to discover SNPs associated with docetaxel-induced neuropathy and mechanistically validate these associations in preclinical models of drug-induced neuropathy.  Experimental design:   A genome-wide association study was conducted in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone and randomized to bevacizumab or placebo on CALGB 90401. SNPs were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap610-Quad platform followed by rigorous quality control. The inference was conducted on the cumulative dose at occurrence of grade 3+ sensory neuropathy using a cause-specific hazard model that accounted for early treatment discontinuation. Genes with SNPs significantly associated with neuropathy were knocked down in cellular and mouse models of drug-induced neuropathy.  Results:   A total of 498,081 SNPs were analyzed in 623 Caucasian patients, 50 (8%) of whom experienced grade 3+ neuropathy. The 1,000 SNPs most associated with neuropathy clustered in relevant pathways including neuropathic pain and axonal guidance. An SNP in VAC14 (rs875858) surpassed genome-wide significance (P = 2.12 × 10-8, adjusted P = 5.88 × 10-7). siRNA knockdown of VAC14 in stem cell-derived peripheral neuronal cells increased docetaxel sensitivity as measured by decreased neurite processes (P = 0.0015) and branches (P < 0.0001). Prior to docetaxel treatment, VAC14 heterozygous mice had greater nociceptive sensitivity than wild-type litter mate controls (P = 0.001).  Conclusions:   VAC14 should be prioritized for further validation of its potential role as a predictor of docetaxel-induced neuropathy and biomarker for treatment individualization.

Herein, we illustrate a novel, yet simple, approach to produce SERS nanoprobes through control of co-solvent composition. AuNP multimers were produced by mixing AuNP monomers in water : ethanol co-solvent for variable periods of time. By varying the water : ethanol ratio and the amount of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) present, the aggregation rate can be systematically controlled. Thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) was then added to halt the aggregation process and provide steric stability. This approach was used to produce pH nanoprobes with excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and in complex samples. The pH probe exhibits broad pH sensitivity over the range 6-11 and we calculate that a single AuNP dimer in a 35 fL volume is sufficient to generate a detectable SERS signal. As a proof-of-concept, the probes were used to detect the intracellular pH of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3). The internalized probes exhibit a strong 4-MBA signal without any interfering bands from either the cells or the culture media and produce exceptionally detailed pH maps. pH maps obtained from 19 xy surface scans and 14 yz depth scans exhibit highly consistent intracellular pH in the range of 5 to 7, thus indicating the greater reliability and reproducibility of our pH probes compared with other probes previously reported in the literature. Our water : ethanol co-solvent production process is fast, simple, and efficient. Adjustment of solvent composition may become a powerful way to produce SERS tags or nanoprobes in the future.""","""['Haoran Wei', 'Marjorie R Willner', 'Linsey C Marr', 'Peter J Vikesland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['A Highly Sensitive SERS and RRS Coupled Di-Mode Method for CO Detection Using Nanogolds as Catalysts and Bifunctional Probes.', 'pH-Triggered Molecular Alignment for Reproducible SERS Detection via an AuNP/Nanocellulose Platform.', 'Synthesis and characterization of a disulfide reporter molecule for enhancing pH measurements based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering.', 'A Dual-Modal SERS/Fluorescence Gold Nanoparticle Probe for Mitochondrial Imaging.', 'Silicon nanohybrid-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensors.', 'High Recognition of Isomer-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles through Matrix Imprinting.', 'Design and Detection of Cyanide Raman Tag pH-Responsive SERS Probes.', 'Highly porous gold supraparticles as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates for sensitive detection of environmental contaminants.', 'Bimetallic Gold Nanostars Having High Aspect Ratio Spikes for Sensitive Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensing.', 'Recent advances in plasmonic Prussian blue-based SERS nanotags for biological application.']"""

The present study examined changes in fatigue among prostate cancer patients receiving ADT compared to controls and predictors of heightened fatigue in ADT patients.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients treated with ADT (ADT+ group, n = 60) completed assessments of fatigue prior to or just after ADT initiation (baseline) and 6 and 12 months later. Prostate cancer patients treated with prostatectomy only (ADT- group, n = 85) and men without cancer (CA- group, n = 86) matched on age and education completed assessments at similar intervals.  Results:   Group-by-time interactions for fatigue severity, interference, and duration were observed when comparing the ADT+ group to the controls. Groups did not differ at baseline; however, the ADT+ group reported worse fatigue at 6 and 12 months. The same pattern was observed for changes in the prevalence of clinically meaningful fatigue and the extent of clinically meaningful change in fatigue. Within the ADT+ group, higher baseline comorbidity scores were associated with greater increases in fatigue interference, and higher baseline Gleason scores were associated with greater increases in fatigue duration.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer patients receiving ADT demonstrate a trajectory of worsened fatigue during the first 12 months following treatment initiation relative to the controls. Greater comorbidities and higher Gleason scores at baseline appear to be risk factors for heightened fatigue during the first year following ADT initiation.

This study was aimed at assessing whether smoking is associated with prostate tumor DNA methylation and whether these alterations may explain in part the association of smoking with PCa recurrence and mortality.  Methods:   A total of 523 men had radical prostatectomy as their primary treatment, detailed smoking history data, long-term follow-up for PCa outcomes, and tumor tissue profiled for DNA methylation. Ninety percent of the men also had matched tumor gene expression data. A methylome-wide analysis was conducted to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by smoking status. To select potential functionally relevant DMRs, their correlation with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of corresponding genes was evaluated. Finally, a smoking-related methylation score based on the top-ranked DMRs was created to assess its association with PCa outcomes.  Results:   Forty DMRs were associated with smoking status, and 10 of these were strongly correlated with mRNA expression (aldehyde oxidase 1 [AOX1], claudin 5 [CLDN5], early B-cell factor 1 [EBF1], homeobox A7 [HOXA7], lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 [LGALS3], microtubule-associated protein τ [MAPT], protocadherin γ A [PCDHGA]/protocadherin γ B [PCDHGB], paraoxonase 3 [PON3], synaptonemal complex protein 2 like [SYCP2L], and zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 12 [ZSCAN12]). Men who were in the highest tertile for the smoking-methylation score derived from these DMRs had a higher risk of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-3.72) and lethal disease (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.65-11.78) in comparison with men in the lower 2 tertiles.  Conclusions:   This integrative molecular epidemiology study supports the hypothesis that smoking-associated tumor DNA methylation changes may explain at least part of the association between smoking and adverse PCa outcomes.

The prescribed dose of LDR-ISBT, HDR-ISBT, and IMRT was 115 Gy, 20 Gy in 2 fractions, and 46 Gy in 23 fractions, respectively. Obstructive and irritative urinary symptoms were assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) examined before and after treatments. After ISBT, IPSS was evaluated in the 1st and 4th weeks, then every 2-3 months for the 1st year, and every 6 months thereafter.  Results:   The median follow-up of the patients treated with LDR-ISBT + IMRT and HDR-ISBT + IMRT was 1070.5 days and 1048.5 days, respectively (p = 0.321). The IPSS-increment in the LDR-ISBT + IMRT group was greater than that in the HDR-ISBT + IMRT between 91 and 180 days after ISBT (p = 0.015). In the LDR-ISBT + IMRT group, the IPSS took longer time to return to the initial level than in the HDR-ISBT + IMRT group (in LDR-ISBT + IMRT group, the recovery time was 90 days later). The dose to urethra showed a statistically significant association with the IPSS-increment in the irritative urinary symptoms (p = 0.011). Clinical outcomes were comparable between both the groups.  Conclusions:   Both therapeutic modalities are safe and well suited for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer; however, it took patients longer to recover from LDR-ISBT + IMRT than from HDR-ISBT + IMRT. It is possible that fast dose delivery induced early symptoms and early recovery, while gradual dose delivery induced late symptoms and late recovery.

The current prospective study examined the short-term impact of cancer on the functioning, development of, and worsening of age-related health conditions among older adults who develop cancer compared with age-matched controls.  Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data were linked with Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data. A total of 921 eligible cases were Medicare beneficiaries with diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer made between their baseline and follow-up MHOS. Using propensity score matching, 4605 controls without cancer were matched from the MHOS. Analysis of covariance and logistic regression were used to examine changes in physical functioning, activities of daily living, age-related conditions, and exacerbation of preexisting conditions for cases compared with controls.  Results:   Cancer groups demonstrated greater declines in activities of daily living and physical function compared with controls (mean, -1.53 [standard error, 0.14]), with the greatest change noted for patients with lung cancer (mean, -6.72 [standard error, 0.94]). Having a cancer diagnosis increased the risk of depression but did not increase the odds of developing arthritis in the hand and/or hip, urinary incontinence (except for prostate cancer), or vision and/or hearing problems. Having a cancer diagnosis also did not exacerbate the severity of arthritis or foot neuropathy.  Conclusions:   The findings of the current study suggest that cancer is a stronger driver for declines in physical functioning and an increased risk of depression in older adults. Interventions are needed to decrease these risks. Clinicians need to prepare patients and families for changes in functioning levels and interventions that limit the declines for older patients with cancer are needed.

The nuclear transcription factor MYC is also frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer and may play a role in tumor initiation and/or progression. The relationship between nuclear ERG and MYC protein overexpression in prostate cancer, as well as the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of ERG-positive/MYC high tumors, is not well understood.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ERG and MYC was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs), and nuclear staining was scored semi-quantitatively (IHC product score range = 0-300). Correlation between nuclear ERG and MYC protein expression and association with clinicopathologic parameters and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy was assessed.  Results:   29.1% of all tumor nodules showed concurrent nuclear ERG and MYC protein overexpression (i.e., ERG-positive/MYC high), including 35.0% of secondary nodules. Overall, there was weak positive correlation between ERG and MYC expression across all tumor nodules (rpb = 0.149, P = 0.045), although this correlation was strongest in secondary nodules (rpb = 0.520, P = 0.019). In radical prostatectomy specimens, ERG-positive/MYC high tumors were positively associated with the presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE), relative to all other ERG/MYC expression subgroups, however, there was no significant association between concurrent nuclear ERG and MYC protein overexpression and time to biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Concurrent nuclear ERG and MYC protein overexpression is common in prostate cancer and defines a subset of locally advanced tumors. Recent data indicates that BET bromodomain proteins regulate ERG gene fusion and MYC gene expression in prostate cancer, suggesting possible synergistic targeted therapeutics in ERG-positive/MYC high tumors.

Methods:   Total of 155 biopsy specimens from initially diagnosed bone metastatic PCa were obtained between 2009.1 and 2012.12. SPINK1 and ERG were detected by using immunohistochemical staining. Factors included age, ECOG score, clinical T stage, Gleason scores (GS), expression of SPINK1 and ERG, baseline PSA, baseline ALP, baseline HGB and PSA normalization, and the association of SPINK1 and ERG with clinical outcomes (CRPC-free survival and overall survival) were analyzed.  Results:   Totally, SPINK1 and ERG were mutually independently expressed in the primary tissues of those patients, and their positivity were only 13.5% (21/155) and 10.9% (17/155), respectively. Positive expression of SPINK1 was completely detected in cases with primary Gleason score 4 or 5; on the contrary, the frequency of ERG was much lower. Correlative analysis only found that SPINK1 was linked with PSA response to androgen deprivation therapy (χ(2) = 11.101, P = 0.001). Survival analysis showed that, ERG was not associated with clinical outcomes in all cases, especially in cases with higher GS (8-10) (n = 90); but SPINK1 was an independent prognostic factor which was associated with adverse CFS of patients with GS 8-10 (CFS: HR = 5.141, 95%CI: 1.108-25.552, P = 0.017).  Conclusions:   It is the first time to simultaneously detect SPINK1 and ERG expression in initially diagnosed bone metastatic PCa. The over-expression of SPINK1 was not only related to poor PSA response, but also significantly associated with the occurrence of CRPC, especially in those with much more aggressive phenotype (GS 8-10). So, SPINK1 could be considered as a useful prognostic predictor for bone metastatic PCa at the time of diagnosis, and further prospective studies are needed to verify the conclusions.

We aimed to evaluate whether perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) affects biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) following radical prostatectomy (RP) for patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 2,713 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1993 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. We performed a comparative analysis based on receipt of transfusion (PBT group vs. no-PBT group) and transfusion type (autologous PBT vs. allogeneic PBT). Univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis were performed to evaluate variables associated with BRFS, CSS, and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival estimates for BRFS, CSS, and OS, and log-rank test was used to conduct comparisons between the groups.  Results:   The number of patients who received PBT was 440 (16.5%). Among these patients, 350 (79.5%) received allogeneic transfusion and the other 90 (20.5%) received autologous transfusion. In a multivariate analysis, allogeneic PBT was found to be statistically significant predictors of BRFS, CSS, and OS; conversely, autologous PBT was not. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly decreased 5-year BRFS (79.2% vs. 70.1%, log-rank, p = 0.001), CSS (98.5% vs. 96.7%, log-rank, p = 0.012), and OS (95.5% vs. 90.6%, log-rank, p < 0.001) in the allogeneic PBT group compared to the no-allogeneic PBT group. In the autologous PBT group, however, none of these were statistically significant compared to the no-autologous PBT group.

Herein, we first analyzed such outcomes in White Hispanic men. We studied 70 men with nonpalpable Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group [GG] 1) prostate cancer (PCa) with ≤2 positive cores on biopsy who underwent RP. In 18 men, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) was >0.15 ng/mL/g. Three of these had insignificant and 15 had significant PCa. The remaining 52 men qualified for EASC. One patient had no PCa identified at RP. Nineteen (37%) had significant PCa defined by volume (n=7), grade (n=7), and volume and grade (n=5). Nine cases were 3+4=7 (GG 2) (5/9 [56%] with pattern 4 <5%), 2 were 3+5=8 (GG 4), and 1 was 4+5=9 (GG 5). Patients with significant PCa more commonly had anterior dominant disease (11/19, 58%) versus patients with insignificant cancer (7/33, 21%) (P=0.01). In 12 cases with higher grade at RP, the dominant tumor nodule was anterior in 6 (50%) and posterior in 6 (median volumes: 1.1 vs. 0.17 cm, respectively; P=0.01). PSA correlated poorly with tumor volume (r=0.28, P=0.049). Gland weight significantly correlated with PSA (r=0.54, P<0.001). While PSAD and PSA mass density correlated with tumor volume, only PSA mass density distinguished cases with significant disease (median, 0.008 vs. 0.012 μg/g; P=0.03). In summary, a PSAD threshold of 0.15 works well in predicting significant tumor volume in Hispanic men. EASC appear to perform better in White Hispanic men than previously reported outcomes for Black non-Hispanic and worse than in White non-Hispanic men.

We aimed to evaluate whether the magnitude of quantitative risk change may serve as a refined end point. We identified 735 men managed with AS at our institution who received a minimum of two biopsies and who were followed for a median of 52 mo. We described the relative changes in the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score from diagnosis to last follow-up and evaluated the proportion of patients experiencing changes in constituent clinical variables. Among patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), the association between change in CAPRA score and the occurrence of adverse pathology (pT3a or higher and/or primary Gleason pattern ≥4) was assessed using logistic regression models. Among patients ultimately treated with RP (n=196), unit increases in CAPRA score from diagnosis were associated with the occurrence of adverse pathology (odds ratio: 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.04; p<0.01). On this basis, disease reclassification should be regarded from the vantage of multiple parameters.  Patient summary:   In this study of men with favorable-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, we evaluated the change in risk status from initial diagnosis to last biopsy using a readily tabulated clinical instrument. Unit change in the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score was associated with increasing risk of adverse pathologic findings at delayed prostatectomy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are generally recognized as promoting tumor progression. As universal regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) are functionally involved in numerous critical cellular processes including macrophage polarization. Let-7b, a miRNA, has differential expression patterns in inflamed tissues compared with healthy controls. However, whether and how miRNA let-7b regulates macrophage phenotype and function is unclear. In this report, we find that up-regulation of let-7b is characteristic of prostatic TAMs, and down-regulation of let-7b in TAMs leads to changes in expression profiles of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-23, IL-10 and TNF-α. As a result, TAMs treated with let-7b inhibitors reduce angiogenesis and prostate carcinoma (PCa) cell mobility.

The factors that predict abiraterone and enzalutamide response are lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the outcomes from primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could predict the outcomes with subsequent novel AR-targeting therapies.  Materials and methods:   We identified 80 consecutive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationships between the primary ADT response and the primary outcome of progression-free survival (PFS) after initiating novel hormonal therapy. The secondary outcomes included prostate-specific antigen decline and overall survival. The survival probabilities were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences assessed with the log-rank test.  Results:   The time to castration resistance with primary ADT showed a significant association with both PFS and overall survival after initiating novel hormone therapy (P = .032 and P = .028, respectively). Patients with progression during primary ADT before 1 year had a median PFS of 3.4 months compared with a median PFS of 7.6 and 8.1 months for patients whose time to castration resistance was ≥ 1 and ≤ 5 years (P = .008) and > 5 years (P = .026), respectively. However, the time to castration resistance was not an independent predictor of survival or the PSA response with novel AR-targeting therapy on multivariate analysis.

We evaluated 90-day direct hospital costs (2014 USD) in the Premier Hospital Database. High costs per robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were those above the 90th percentile and low costs were those below the 10th percentile.  Results:   Mean hospital cost per robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was $11,878 (95% CI $11,804-$11,952). Mean cost was $2,837 (95% CI $2,805-$2,869) in the low cost group vs $25,906 (95% CI $24,702-$25,490) in the high cost group. Nearly a third of the variation in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cost was attributable to hospital characteristics and more than a fifth was attributable to surgeon characteristics (R-squared 30.43% and 21.25%, respectively). High volume surgeons and hospitals (90th percentile or greater) had decreased odds of high cost surgery (surgeons: OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.54; hospitals: OR 0.105, 95% CI 0.02-0.46).

We compared the outcomes of 2 active surveillance regimens that differ in whether a scheduled biopsy was performed in the absence of clinical progression.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 313 consecutive patients with prostate cancer at a NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) institution who were assigned prospectively to 1 of 2 active surveillance biopsy regimens. A total of 149 patients underwent biopsy only for clinical concern (for-cause only) while 164 underwent for-cause biopsy plus scheduled annual or biannual biopsy. Times to biopsy, clinical progression, pathological reclassification and treatment were compared using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  Results:   The for-cause only and scheduled plus for-cause biopsy groups were similar in NCCN risk category at active surveillance initiation. Median followup was 48 and 38 months, respectively. No significant difference was observed in prostate specific antigen dynamics or clinical progression rates. However, patients in the scheduled plus for-cause group underwent significantly more frequent biopsies (p <0.001) and experienced more biopsy related complications (p = 0.04), pathological reclassification (p = 0.02) and treatment conversion (p = 0.001).

This study offers unique insights into the interplay between cancer stem cells and osteocytes/osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells using a three-dimensional (3D) live cancer-bone interactive model. We provide extraordinary cryptic details of the biological events that occur as a result of alendronate (ALN) treatment using 3D live cancer-bone model systems under specific bone remodeling stages. While cancer cells are susceptible to BP treatment in the absence of bone, they are totally unaffected in the presence of bone. Cancer cells colonize live bone irrespective of whether the bone is committed to bone resorption or formation and hence, cancer-bone metastasis/interactions are though to be ""independent of bone remodeling stages"". In our 3D live bone model systems, ALN inhibited bone resorption at the osteoclast differentiation level through effects of mineral-bound ALN on osteocytes and osteoblasts. The mineral-bound ALN rendered bone incapable of osteoblast differentiation, while cancer cells colonize the bone with striking morphological adaptations which led to a conclusion that a direct anti-cancer effect of BPs in a ""live or in vivo"" bone microenvironment is implausible. The above studies were complemented with mass spectrometric analysis of the media from cancer-bone organ cultures in the absence and presence of ALN. The mineral-bound ALN impacts the bone organs by limiting transformation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and leads to diminished endosteal cell population and degenerated osteocytes within the mineralized bone matrix.""","""['Abeer Alasmari', 'Shih-Chun Lin', 'Serge Dibart', 'Erdjan Salih']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Effects of drug discontinuation after short-term daily alendronate administration on osteoblasts and osteocytes in mice.', 'Visualizing mineral binding and uptake of bisphosphonate by osteoclasts and non-resorbing cells.', 'Three-dimensional cancer-bone metastasis model using ex-vivo co-cultures of live calvarial bones and cancer cells.', 'Bone targeting agents: bisphosphonates.', 'Therapeutic implications of suppressing osteoclast formation versus function.', 'Functionalization of Titanium Dioxide by In Situ Surface Crystallization of Bisphosphonate-Based Coordination Complexes.', 'High affinity zoledronate-based metal complex nanocrystals to potentially treat osteolytic metastases.', 'Ex vivo Bone Models and Their Potential in Preclinical Evaluation.', 'Potentiating bisphosphonate-based coordination complexes to treat osteolytic metastases.']"""

The committee created the ACPM Choosing Wisely Task Force to lead the development of ACPM's recommendations with the intention of facilitating wise decisions about the appropriate use of preventive care. After utilizing an iterative process that involved reviewing evidence-based literature, the ACPM Choosing Wisely Task Force developed five recommendations targeted toward overused services within the field of preventive medicine. These include: (1) don't take a multivitamin, vitamin E, or beta carotene to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer; (2) don't routinely perform prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer; (3) don't use whole-body scans for early tumor detection in asymptomatic patients; (4) don't use expensive medications when an equally effective and lower-cost medication is available; and (5) don't perform screening for cervical cancer in low-risk women aged 65 years or older and in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease.

Currently only a few chemotherapeutics are available for CRPC. Therefore, it is critical for identifying a new drug. In this study, we will explore a new agent, Saikosaponin-d (SSd), for CRPC therapy based on its mechanism of action. DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells representing CRPC were employed in this study. A series of cell, biochemical, and molecular biologic assays such as Immunofluorescence, Zymography, Sphere formation, Colony formation, and MTT were used. Finally, we find SSd can significantly inhibit the growth of PCa cells in both dose- and time-dependent and suppress the colony formation during a long-term drug administration, it also can inhibit their migration and invasion abilities, which was accompanied by reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppress MMP2/9 expression as well as activities. Furthermore, SSd can suppress cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes such as self-renewal ability. Mechanistically, SSd blocks Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by decreasing GSK3β phosphorylation to affect EMT and CSC. These findings demonstrate the mechanism of anti-cancer activity of SSd in targeting EMT and CSC, suggesting SSd can be a potent agent for CRPC therapy.""","""['Di Zhong', 'Hui-Jian Zhang', 'Yao-Dong Jiang', 'Peng Wu', 'Huan Qi', 'Chao Cai', 'Shao-Bin Zheng', 'Qiang Dang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Chemotherapeutic Potential of Saikosaponin D: Experimental Evidence.', 'Pao Pereira Extract Suppresses Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Growth, Survival, and Invasion Through Inhibition of NFκB Signaling.', 'Saikosaponin D from Radix Bupleuri suppresses triple-negative breast cancer cell growth by targeting β-catenin signaling.', 'Targeting Cancer Stem Cells in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The regulatory pathways leading to stem-like cells underlie prostate cancer progression.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'The function of natural compounds in important anticancer mechanisms.', 'Chemotherapeutic Potential of Saikosaponin D: Experimental Evidence.', 'Countering Triple Negative Breast Cancer via Impeding Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling, a Phytotherapeutic Approach.', 'Saikosaponin D: review on the antitumour effects, toxicity and pharmacokinetics.']"""

We calculated DALYs for cancer in middle-aged and older adults participating in the Consortium on Health and Ageing Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES) consortium.  Methods:   A total of 90 199 participants from five European cohorts with 10 455 incident cancers and 4399 deaths were included in this study. DALYs were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost because of premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lost because of disability (YLDs). Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) were also estimated for five cancer risk factors, ie, smoking, adiposity, physical inactivity, alcohol intake, and type II diabetes.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 12 years, the total number of DALYs lost from cancer was 34 474 (382 per 1000 individuals) with a similar distribution by sex. Lung cancer was responsible for the largest number of lost DALYs (22.9%), followed by colorectal (15.3%), prostate (10.2%), and breast cancer (8.7%). Mortality (81.6% of DALYs) predominated over disability. Ever cigarette smoking was the risk factor responsible for the greatest total cancer burden (24.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.2% to 26.0%), followed by physical inactivity (4.9%, 95% CI = 0.8% to 8.1%) and adiposity (1.8%, 95% CI = 0.2% to 2.8%).  Conclusions:   DALYs lost from cancer were substantial in this large European sample of middle-aged and older adults. Even if the burden of disease because of cancer is predominantly caused by mortality, some cancers have sizeable consequences for disability.

Whether they are at a higher risk for cancer of other types remains debatable, especially for Asians. We studied the risk of incident cancer in COPD patients using a nationwide representative database, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.  Methods:   From 1995 to 2008, 50,875 COPD patients who were free of antecedent malignancy were identified and followed up to development of malignancy, death or end of 2008, whichever came first. The risk of cancer was determined with the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), which is based on comparison to the national cancer incidence among the general population.  Results:   During a median follow-up period of 5.61 years, 3623 (7.02 %) patients developed cancer and the SIR was 1.2 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.24, p < 0.001]. The risk remained higher at <1, 1-5, and even ≥5 years after the diagnosis of COPD (SIR 1.83, 1.07, and 1.11, respectively).

Materials and methods:   There were 2813 patients treated with RP and postoperatively followed with clinical and prostate-specific antigen assessments. Estimation of conditional survival (CS) probabilities used the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to calculate proportional hazard ratios for prediction of DFS after stratification by prognostics characteristics.  Results:   The 5-year DFS rate was 71.2%. The DFS rate 5 years after RP increased to 77.4% (+8.7%), 82.1% (+15.3%), 88.0% (+23.6%), and 94.0% (+32.0%) for patients surviving without recurrence 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after RP, respectively. This represented a relatively stable survival gain per survived year ranging from 5.6% to 8.7%. The conditional 5-year DFS improves mainly for disease-free surviving patients with adverse pathologic factors. Among patients with pT3b-4 disease, the probability of surviving without recurrence to year 5 increased from 20.7% at the time of presentation to 78.9% for patients surviving 4 years without recurrence (+281%) as compared to +12.5% in pT2 disease. The impact of Gleason score and pT stage on CS estimates remained stable over time. Findings were confirmed upon multivariable analyses.

Patients and methods:   Between 2001 and 2015, 5841 patients underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution, out of which 28 were MISP. Indications for MISP were prostate-specific antigen nadir +2 ng/dL in radio-recurrent patients and biopsy-proven prostate cancer (PCa) in other ablative treatments. We analyzed primary cancer characteristics, surgical data, perioperative complications, oncologic and functional outcomes of MISP, and further compared results between MISP after primary whole-gland treatment (WT) and focal treatment (FT).  Results:   Median age at salvage treatment was 65 (interquartile range [IQR] 61-68). Compared with WT, MISP after FT had significantly lower operative time (133 vs 176 min, P = .001) and fewer upstaging (≥pT3a) (28% vs 79%, P = .008) at final pathology. Overall, positive surgical margin (PSM) were noted in 4 patients (14%). Perioperative complications were observed in 9 patients with no difference between groups. At 12-months follow-up, 57% were continent and 33% had moderate to severe urinary leak. Potency was preserved in 6 out of 10 preoperatively potent patients. Over a median follow-up of 62 months (IQR 43-110), 11 patients relapsed with a median time to biochemical recurrence of 16 months (IQR 7-25). Recurrences were managed with salvage radiotherapy in 6 patients, 4 with hormone therapy and 1 castration-resistant prostate cancer. Overall, 24 patients are alive at last follow-up and 18 (72%) remain disease free.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of all men (n = 201) who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between July 2012 and July 2014. Patients were divided into a study group (n = 63) who had undergone pre-biopsy 3-Tesla MRI, followed by visual targeted and systematic prostate biopsy, and a control group (n = 138) who had undergone systematic biopsy alone. The two groups were well matched regarding patient and cancer characteristics. The primary study objective was to assess the accuracy of pre-biopsy MRI for localizing the index tumour. Secondary study objectives were to assess the accuracy of MRI in assessing the maximum tumour diameter (MTD) of the index tumour focus and accuracy of the targeted biopsy in determining the Gleason score and primary Gleason grade of the index tumour focus and whether PSMs were improved after RARP. The reference standard was whole-gland pathology of the resected prostate gland. Continuous variables and proportions were compared using the t-test and Mann-Whitney test or contingency tables, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare measurement of MTD.  Results:   The MRI accurately located the index tumour focus in 73% of patients. Accuracies, stratified according to use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) categories 5, 4 and 3, were 94, 75 and 60% respectively. Accuracies stratified according to MTD of ≤0.7, ≤1 and >1 cm were 50, 57 and 79%, respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between MRI and histological MTD (r = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.63; P = 0.002), but MRI generally underestimated the MTD: the mean MRI-measured MTD was 1.51 cm (95% CI 1.29-1.72) vs a mean pathological MTD of 2.15 cm (95% CI 1.86-2.43). Targeted biopsy identified 37% more cancer per core than non-targeted biopsy. The mean maximum core length was 8.9 mm (95% CI 7.8-10) vs 6.5 mm (95% CI 5.8-7.2) for the study vs the control group (P = 0.0002; non-paired t-test). Gleason scoring was significantly more predictive after targeted biopsies, with unchanged scores in 40/63 men (63%) vs 62/138 men (45%) in the study and control groups, respectively (P = 0.001; Fisher's test). The odds of Gleason upgrading were 2.5 times greater (P = 0.028) in the control group. The primary Gleason grade was not significantly different in the two groups [45/63 men (71%) vs 91/138 men (66%); study vs control group respectively (P = 0.51, Fisher's test)]. Overall PSMs were nonsignificantly lower in the study group (15.8 vs 18.8%; P = 0.84, Fisher's test); and the MRI location of the index tumour focus correlated with the site of PSM in 70% of men in the study group.  Conclusions:   Pre-biopsy MRI can accurately identify the index prostate tumour, especially in those with higher PI-RADS grades and tumour diameter. Targeted biopsy of this focus retrieves significantly more cancerous tissue per core, and is more accurate regarding Gleason scores, but not primary Gleason grade.

Subjects and methods:   Data of 147 NAfs, who underwent radical prostatectomy for low risk PCa diagnosed via a 12-core biopsy in 2 academic centers between 2011 and 2015, were reviewed retrospectively to assess rates of worse pathological outcomes defined as: Gleason score upgrade to at least 3+4, upstage to pT3a or higher or pN1, and positive surgical margins.  Results:   Overall significant upstage and/or upgrade occurred in 20.2% and positive surgical margins occured in18.3%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent variables that predicted for upstage and/or upgrade or positive surgical margins in the entire cohort were: NCCN risk group (low risk>very low risk), advanced age>60 years, PSA>6ng/ml, PSA density≥0.15, more than 2 positive cores in biopsy, more than 50% cancer involvement in positive cores, clinical stage (T2a>T1c) and UCSF-CAPRA-S score>3.  Conclusions:   Our study found that, at least pathologically, NAf men do not have more aggressive disease than Caucasians and African Americans in both low and very low risk PCa.

However, the molecular mechanisms of PC progression are still to be uncovered. MicroRNA (miRNA) has been shown to be associated with the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Among the identified tumor-promoting miRNAs, miR-96 has been well established to contribute to PC by reducing FOXO1 expression. This study is aimed to study if miR-96 can promote the progression of PC through other pathways. Our data reinforced the finding that the level of miR-96 was higher in PC samples and cell lines than in non-cancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cells. In addition, serum miR-96 abundance was also found to be elevated in PC patients. Decreasing miR-96 expression was able to suppress the proliferation, clonogenicity, and invasion of PC cells. Overexpressing miR-96 led to increased proliferation and colony formation of normal prostate epithelial cells. miR-96 level was found to be inversely associated with the abundance of metastasis suppressor protein 1 (MTSS1) messenger RNA (mRNA), which has been proved to be a tumor suppressor for PC. Predictive analysis indicated that there was a potential miRNA response elements (MREs) located within 3'UTR of MTSS1 mRNA. The changes in miR-96 expression can affect the levels of MTSS1 both at mRNA and protein levels. miR-96 also suppressed the activity of luciferase reporter under the regulation of 3'UTR of MTSS1. Further studies showed that MTSS1 restoration accounted for the effect of miR-96 reduction on PC cells. The overexpression of a recombinant MTSS1 resistant against miRNA regulation was also demonstrated to abolish the transforming effect of miR-96 on prostate epithelial cells. Taken together, we found that miR-96 has a higher abundance in serum samples of PC patients than healthy controls, implying that it may be used as a prognostic marker. MTSS1 is a new authentic target of miR-96 in PC. The above findings suggested that targeting miR-96 may be a promising strategy for PC treatment.""","""['Libo Xu', 'Jiateng Zhong', 'Baofeng Guo', 'Qi Zhu', 'Hang Liang', 'Naiyan Wen', 'Wenjing Yun', 'Ling Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['MicroRNA-182-5p promotes cell invasion and proliferation by down regulating FOXF2, RECK and MTSS1 genes in human prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-411 promoted the osteosarcoma progression by suppressing MTSS1 expression.', 'MTSS1 hypermethylation is associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'MTSS1: a multifunctional protein and its role in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'MicroRNA-96: A therapeutic and diagnostic tumor marker.', 'miR-96-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-181b-5p and miR-200b-3p heterogenous expression in sites of prostate cancer versus benign prostate hyperplasia-archival samples study.', 'Genomic and Functional Regulation of TRIB1 Contributes to Prostate Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'Regulation of cell-cell adhesion in prostate cancer cells by microRNA-96 through upregulation of E-Cadherin and EpCAM.', 'miR-96-5p promotes the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells by suppressing Caveolae1.']"""

There are limited data regarding the impact of TRT on prostate androgen concentrations.  Objective:   Determine the dose-dependent effects of exogenous T administration on intraprostatic androgen concentrations.  Design:   Twelve-week, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  Setting:   Academic medical center.  Participants:   Sixty-two healthy eugonadal men, aged 25-55 years.  Interventions:   Subjects were randomly assigned to receive injections of acyline, a GnRH antagonist (used to achieve medical castration), every 2 weeks plus transdermal T gel (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5.0 g, 10 g, or 15 g daily), or placebo injections and transdermal gel for 12 weeks.  Main outcomes:   Serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured at baseline and every 2 weeks during treatment. Intraprostatic T and DHT concentrations were assessed from tissue obtained through ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsies at week 12. Androgens were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   51 men completed the study and were included in the analysis. There were no significant adverse events. Exogenous T resulted in a dose-dependent increase in serum T and DHT concentrations (190-770 and 60-180 ng/dL, respectively). Although intraprostatic T differed among dose groups (P = .01), intraprostatic DHT was comparable regardless of T dose (P = .11) and was 10- to 20-fold greater than intraprostatic T.  Conclusions:   In healthy, medically castrate men receiving exogenous T, the total intraprostatic androgen concentration (predominantly DHT) remained stable across serum T concentrations within the physiological range.

The rates of diffusion of this technology across the United States are unknown. The goal of the current study was to describe the use of SBRT among patients with prostate cancer based on different risk groups (low, intermediate, or high risk) and by type of facility (community cancer program, comprehensive community cancer program, or academic program) in which patients were treated.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Data Base, a national registry that contains approximately 70% of patients with cancer in the United States, the authors identified 274,466 men between the ages of 40 to 80 years who were diagnosed from 2004 to 2012 with localized prostate cancer and received radiation therapy (RT) as their initial treatment. The authors described the prevalence of SBRT use each year, and multivariable analysis was used to examine factors associated with the receipt of SBRT.  Results:   In 2004, SBRT use was low (<1% in all patient groups), and was observed to increase steadily each year. By 2012, 8.8% of low-risk patients treated at academic centers with RT received SBRT. Uptake of SBRT was highest in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that year of diagnosis, type of center, risk group, and race were all significantly associated with the use of SBRT.  Conclusions:   To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first report of the adoption of SBRT for localized prostate cancer across the United States. Diffusion was noted to be slowest at community cancer programs, reflecting potential barriers of cost or expertise for this new technology. Adoption of SBRT was found to be highest among patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease, in accordance with the bulk of patients included in published SBRT studies.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess whether IMRT can provide better clinical outcomes in comparison with 3DCRT in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a meta-analysis of 23 studies (n = 9556) comparing the clinical outcomes, including gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, genitourinary (GU) toxicity, biochemical controland overall survival (OS).

In order to improve preclinical testing for TNBC that relies primarily on using human xenografts in immunodeficient mice, we have developed a novel immunocompetent syngeneic murine tumor transplant model for basal-like triple-negative breast cancer. The C3(1)/SV40-T/t-antigen (C3(1)/Tag) mouse mammary tumor model in the FVB/N background shares important similarities with human basal-like TNBC. However, these tumors or derived cell lines are rejected when transplanted into wt FVB/N mice, likely due to the expression of SV40 T-antigen. We have developed a sub-line of mice (designated REAR mice) that carry only one copy of the C3(1)/Tag-antigen transgene resulting from a spontaneous transgene rearrangement in the original founder line. Unlike the original C3(1)/Tag mice, REAR mice do not develop mammary tumors or other phenotypes observed in the original C3(1)/Tag transgenic mice. REAR mice are more immunologically tolerant to SV40 T-antigen driven tumors and cell lines in an FVB/N background (including prostate tumors from TRAMP mice), but are otherwise immunologically intact. This transplant model system offers the ability to synchronously implant the C3(1)/Tag tumor-derived M6 cell line or individual C3(1)/Tag tumors from various stages of tumor development into the mammary fat pads or tail veins of REAR mice. C3(1)/Tag tumors or M6 cells implanted into the mammary fat pads spontaneously metastasize at a high frequency to the lung and liver. M6 cells injected by tail vein can form brain metastases. We demonstrate that irradiated M6 tumor cells or the same cells expressing GM-CSF can act as a vaccine to retard tumor growth of implanted tumor cells in the REAR model.

When computationally derived from sequence information alone, the identification should be verified by integrated analyses of mRNA and miRNA expression. The drawback of this strategy is the vast number of identified interactions, which prevents an experimental or detailed investigation of each pair. In this paper, we overcome this difficulty by the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE), which reduces the number of identified miRNA-mRNA interactions that properly discriminate between patients and healthy controls without losing biological feasibility. The approach is applied to six cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal/colon cancer and breast cancer. In PCA-based unsupervised FE, the significance does not depend on the number of samples (as in the standard case) but on the number of features, which approximates the number of miRNAs/mRNAs.

Here we report novel observations on the role of IRX5 in adult vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies using primary human endothelial cells, VSMCs, and intact carotid arteries to determine relative expression of Irx5 in the peripheral vasculature demonstrate significantly higher expression in VSMCs. Sprague-Dawley rat carotid arteries were subjected to balloon catherization, and the presence of IRX5 was examined by immunohistochemistry after 2 wk. Results indicate markedly elevated IRX5 signal at 14 days compared with uninjured controls. Total RNA was isolated from injured and uninjured arteries, and Irx5 expression was measured by RT-PCR. Results demonstrate a significant increase in Irx5 expression at 3-14 days postinjury compared with controls. Irx5 genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies using thymidine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays resulted in modulation of DNA synthesis in primary rat aortic VSMCs. Quantitative RT-PCR results revealed modulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27(kip1)), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2f1), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) expression in Irx5-transduced VSMCs compared with controls. Subsequently, apoptosis was observed and confirmed by morphological observation, caspase-3 cleavage, and enzymatic activation compared with control conditions.

Expression of various transcripts, including miRNAs, is markedly deregulated in cancerous prostate tissue. This study aimed at identifying a PCa-specific expression profile of miRNAs for subsequent use in noninvasive diagnostics.  Materials and methods:   MiRNA expression was profiled in 13 PCa tissues using human miRNA microarrays. Highly expressed miRNAs were selected for the analysis in urine of patients with PCa (N=143) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; N=23) by means of real time PCR, while miRNAs showing the expression differences in relation to clinical variables were further analyzed in 52 PCa and 12 noncancerous prostate tissues (NPT) on TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDA).  Results:   Analysis of miRNA expression in prostate tissue linked miR-95 to aggressive form of PCa. This miRNA was up-regulated in high grade (P=0.041), the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive tumors (P=0.026), and in patients with subsequently developed biochemical recurrence (BCR; P=0.054) after radical prostatectomy. MiRNAs highly expressed in PCa tissues were also detectable in urine from PCa patients. Moreover, the urinary levels of miR-21 had significant discriminatory power (P=0.010) to separate PCa patients from BPH, while the combined analysis of urinary miR-19a and miR-19b was prognostic for BCR. In PCa, the diagnostic potential of urinary miRNA panel (miR-21, miR-19a, and miR-19b) was higher than that of the PSA test (AUC=0.738 vs. AUC=0.514).

Multiple lines of evidence now indicate, however, that defects in key regulators of DNA repair pathways are highly enriched in human metastasis specimens and hence may be a key step in the acquisition of metastasis and the ability of localized disease to disseminate. Some of the key regulators of checkpoints in the DNA damage response are the TP53 protein and the PARP enzyme family.

The optimal biopsy method after mpMRI is under discussion.  Objective:   Prospective, PIRADS- and START-conform analysis of the relevance of mpMRI and MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy in patients with prior negative TRUS biopsy and comparison of the detection rates of fusion-targeted biopsies (tB) and systematic transperineal saturation biopsies (sB).  Materials and methods:   Between 10/2012 and 09/2015, 287 patients with prior negative TRUS biopsy underwent mpMRI and software-assisted, rigid MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy. In addition to and strictly separated from sB (median cores n = 24), tB (median cores per patient n = 4, per lesion n = 3) were performed in case of suspicious MRI lesions (PIRADS ≥ 2). Both biopsy methods were compared by using McNemar's test.  Results:   Of the 287 patients, 148 (52 %) had positive biopsies. Of these, 108/287 (38 %) had significant PCa (Gleason Score [GS] = 3 + 3 and PSA ≥ 10 ng/ml or GS ≥ 3 + 4) and again 43/287 (15 %) had a GS ≥ 4 + 3 PCa. sB failed to diagnose 8/148 PCa (5.4 %) and 6/108 significant PCa (5.5 %), whereas tB failed to diagnose 48 (32.4 %) PCa (p < 0.0001) and 22 (20.4 %) significant PCa (p = 0.0046). Of the PCa missed by tB, 11 had a GS ≥ 3 + 4 and 5 of these a GS = 4 + 3.

The hydrophobic docetaxel (DTX) was attached to the grafts by pH-sensitive hydrazone bonds and also encapsulated into the POSS core (SP-DTX). Thus, the final amphiphilic star-shaped conjugates could self-assemble into nanoparticles and exhibited conspicuous drug-loading capacity (20.1 wt %) based on the covalently conjugated accompanied by physically encapsulated DTX. The stimuli-responsive DTX release under acidic lysosomal and reducing cytoplasmic environments was verified, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity against PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells. To evaluate the in vivo therapeutic effects of the DTX-loaded nanovehicles objectively, a stroma-rich, prostate xenograft tumor model was generated. SP-DTX displayed uniform tumor distribution and suppressed tumor growth to a more pronounced level (tumor inhibition of 78.9%) than nonredox-sensitive SP-DTX-A (67.4%), SP-DTX-C contained DTX only in the core (65.5%) or linear P-DTX (60.7%) through enhanced depletion of cancer-associated fibroblasts and induction of apoptosis.

Measured uncertainties were combined to examine planning margin adequacy for contours propagated for adaptive therapy and to assess the trade-off of DIR and interobserver uncertainty in atlas-based automatic segmentation. Two experi-enced dosimetrists retrospectively contoured brainstem, spinal cord, anterior oral cavity, larynx, right and left parotids, optic nerves, and eyes on the planning CT (CT1) and attenuation-correction CT of diagnostic PET/CT (CT2) for 30 patients who received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Two senior radiation oncology residents retrospectively contoured prostate, bladder, and rectum on the postseed-implant CT (CT1) and planning CT (CT2) for 20 patients who received radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Interobserver variation was measured by calculating mean Hausdorff distances between the two observers' contours. CT2 was deformably registered to CT1 via commercially available multipass B-spline DIR. CT2 contours were propagated and compared with CT1 contours via mean Hausdorff distances. These values were summed in quadrature with interobserver variation for margin analysis and compared with interobserver variation for sta-tistical significance using two-tailed t-tests for independent samples (α = 0.05). Combined uncertainty ranged from 1.5-5.8 mm for head and neck structures and 3.1-3.7 mm for pelvic structures. Conventional 5 mm margins may not be adequate to cover this additional uncertainty. DIR uncertainty was significantly less than interobserver variation for four head and neck and one pelvic ROI. DIR uncertainty was not significantly different than interobserver variation for four head and neck and one pelvic ROI.

Ten patients treated with a simultaneous integrated intraprostatic boost (SIIB) were retrospectively selected and replanned with incremental 1 mm margins from 0-5 mm around the IPL to determine if there were any significant differences in dosimetric parameters. Sensitivity analysis was then performed accounting for random and systematic uncertainties in both prostate motion and deformation to ensure adequate dose was delivered to the IPL. Prostate deformation was assessed using daily CBCT imaging and implanted fiducial markers. The average IPL volume without margin was 2.3% of the PTV volume and increased to 11.8% with a 5 mm margin. Despite these changes in vol-ume, the only statistically significant dosimetric difference was found for the PTV maximum dose, which increased with increasing margin.

An analysis of the measurements per linac and energy over a two-year period was performed, which included a more detailed examination per technique and treat-ment site over a six-month period. A comparison of the treatment planning system doses and the doses estimated by EPIgray shows a mean of the differences of 1.9% (± 5.2%) for the two-year period. The 3D conformal treatment plans had a mean dose difference of 2.0% (± 4.9%), while for intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy treatments the mean dose difference was -3.0 (± 5.3%) and -2.5 (± 5.2%), respectively. In addition, root cause analyses were conducted on the in vivo dosimetry measurements of two breast cancer treatment techniques, as well as prostate treatments with intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy. During the breast study, the dose differences of breast treatments in supine position were correlated to patient setup and EPID positioning errors. Based on these observations, an automatic image shift correc-tion algorithm is developed by DOSIsoft S.A. The prostate study revealed that beams and arcs with out-of-tolerance in vivo dosimetry results tend to have more complex modulation and a lower exposure of the points of interest. The statistical studies indicate that in vivo dosimetry with EPIgray has been successfully imple-mented for classical and complex techniques in clinical routine at our institution. The additional breast and prostate studies exhibit the prospects of EPIgray as an easy supplementary quality assurance tool.

Using the corresponding displacement vector field (atlas-DVF), the CT image was deformed to the MR image to create an atlas MR-CT pair. Regions of interest (ROI) on the atlas MR-CT pair were delineated and used to create atlas-ROI masks. 'Leave-one-out' test (one pair of MR and CT was used as subject-MR and subject-CT for evaluation, and the remaining 9 pairs were in the atlas library) was performed. For a subject-MR, autosegmentation and DVFs were generated using DIR between the subject-MR and the 9 atlas-MRs. An S-CT was then generated using the corresponding 9 paired atlas-CTs, the 9 atlas-DVFs and the corresponding atlas-ROI masks.

Accumulating evidence supports a central role for the miR-21 guide strand (miR-21-5p) in ovarian cancer initiation, progression, and chemoresistance. However, there is limited information regarding the biological role of the miR-21 passenger strand (miR-21-3p) in ovarian cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-21-3p and its target genes in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Expression profiling of miR-21-5p and miR-21-3p was performed in a panel of cancer cells by qPCR. Colony formation and invasion assays were carried out on ovarian and prostate cancer cells transfected with miR-21-5p and miR-21-3p inhibitors. Dual luciferase reporter assays were used to identify the miR-21-3p target genes in ovarian cancer cells. Our results show that miR-21-5p had higher expression levels compared to miR-21-3p on a panel of cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of miR-21-5p or miR-21-3p resulted in a significant decrease in ovarian and prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Luciferase reporter assays identify RNA Binding Protein with Multiple Splicing (RBPMS), Regulator of Chromosome Condensation and POZ Domain Containing Protein 1 (RCBTB1), and Zinc Finger protein 608 (ZNF608) as miR-21-3p target genes. SiRNA-induced RBPMS silencing reduced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Immunohistochemical analyses of serous ovarian cancer patient samples suggest a significant decrease of RBMPS levels when compared to normal ovarian epithelium. Taken together, the data generated in this study suggests a functional role for miR-21-3p in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors.""","""['Perla M Báez-Vega', 'Ileabett M Echevarría Vargas', 'Fatma Valiyeva', 'Joel Encarnación-Rosado', 'Adriana Roman', 'Josean Flores', 'María J Marcos-Martínez', 'Pablo E Vivas-Mejía']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-133b targets glutathione S-transferase π expression to increase ovarian cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs.', 'Long non-coding RNA ZFAS1 interacts with miR-150-5p to regulate Sp1 expression and ovarian cancer cell malignancy.', 'RhoC is a major target of microRNA-93-5P in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tumorigenesis and progression.', 'MicroRNA-490-3p and -490-5p in carcinogenesis: Separate or the same goal?', 'Ascites in ovarian cancer: MicroRNA deregulations and their potential roles in ovarian carcinogenesis.', 'miRNAs: Potential as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'Photosensitized co-generation of nitric oxide and singlet oxygen Enhanced toxicity against ovarian cancer cells.', 'CircCSDE1 Regulates Proliferation and Differentiation of C2C12 Myoblasts by Sponging miR-21-3p.', 'Exploring prognostic value and regulation network of PPP1R1A in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Upregulation of the Long Noncoding RNA CASC10 Promotes Cisplatin Resistance in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.']"""

We analytically validated an RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) assay for total AR and AR-V7 for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate tumors.  Experimental design:   We used prostate cell lines and xenografts to validate chromogenic RISH to detect RNA containing AR exon 1 (AR-E1, surrogate for total AR RNA species) and cryptic exon 3 (AR-CE3, surrogate for AR-V7 expression). RISH signals were quantified in FFPE primary tumors and CRPC specimens, comparing to known AR and AR-V7 status by IHC and RT-PCR.  Results:   The quantified RISH results correlated significantly with total AR and AR-V7 levels by RT-PCR in cell lines, xenografts, and autopsy metastases. Both AR-E1 and AR-CE3 RISH signals were localized in nuclear punctae in addition to the expected cytoplasmic speckles. Compared with admixed benign glands, AR-E1 expression was significantly higher in primary tumor cells with a median fold increase of 3.0 and 1.4 in two independent cohorts (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.04, respectively). While AR-CE3 expression was detectable in primary prostatic tumors, levels were substantially higher in a subset of CRPC metastases and cell lines, and were correlated with AR-E1 expression.  Conclusions:   RISH for AR-E1 and AR-CE3 is an analytically valid method to examine total AR and AR-V7 RNA levels in FFPE tissues.

Methods:   All OSA diagnoses included in an employee-sponsored health insurance database spanning the years 2003-2012 were identified and 1:1 matched demographically based on age, gender, and state of residence, or alternatively matched by comorbidities. The incidence of 12 types of cancer was assessed. In addition, another cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer was retrieved, and the risk of metastatic disease or cancer mortality was determined as a function of the presence or absence of OSA. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to assess the independent associations between OSA and outcomes of interest.  Results:   Based on a cohort of ∼5.6 million individuals, the incidence of all cancer diagnoses combined was similar in OSA and retrospectively matched cases. However, the adjusted risk of pancreatic and kidney cancer and melanoma were significantly higher in patients with OSA, while the risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers appeared to be lower. Among individuals with a diagnosis of cancer, the presence of OSA was not associated with an increased risk for metastasis or death.

Methods:   MUC1 expression was evaluated in tissue microarrays constructed from 119 nodal positive prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy.

Results:   MUC1 expression was significantly different between primary tumors, lymph node metastases and non-neoplastic glands (scores 53.7 vs 30.1 vs 16.6; P<0.0001). High MUC1 expression in primary tumors was positively correlated with tumor volume (mean 24.4 cm(3) vs 14.5 cm(3); P=0.005) and T-stage (P=0.009); in lymph node metastases, high expression corresponded with a greater total size of metastases (mean 35.8 mm vs 12.7 mm; P<0.001) and a higher ratio of positive to examined lymph nodes (mean 0.22 vs 0.12; P=0.014). High MUC1 expression in lymph node metastases predicted unfavorable outcomes compared with low MUC1 expression (bRFS P=0.023, DSS and OS P⩽0.001), whereas in primary tumors, the same tendency was non-significant. In multivariate analyses, high MUC1 expression in primary tumors and lymph node metastases independently predicted early biochemical failure (P=0.046) and tumor-related death (P=0.0038), respectively.

The role of FOXF1 in cancer is conflicting; its loss in some cancers suggests a tumor suppressive function, but its abundance in others is associated with protumorigenic and metastatic traits. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) is associated with advanced-stage prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) in patients. We detected a population of FOXF1-positive tumor cells in aggressive mouse and human PCa. Using two murine orthotopic models of PCa, we found that overexpression of FOXF1 in Myc-CaP and TRAMP prostate tumor cells induced tumor growth in the prostate and progression to peritoneal metastasis. Increased growth of FOXF1-positive prostate tumors was associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK5, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. FOXF1 transcriptionally induced and directly bound to promoter regions of genes encoding the kinases MAP3K2 and WNK1, which promoted the phosphorylation and activation of ERK5. Knockdown of ERK5 or both MAP3K2 and WNK1 in FOXF1-overexpressing PCa cells reduced cell proliferation in culture and suppressed tumor growth and tumor metastasis when implanted into mice. In human tumors, FOXF1 expression correlated positively with that of MAP3K2 and WNK1 Thus, in contrast to some tumors where FOXF1 may function as a tumor suppressor, FOXF1 promotes prostate tumor growth and progression by activating ERK5 signaling.

The US Food and Drug Administration recently cautioned that testosterone replacement therapy might increase risk of heart attack and stroke, based on evidence from studies with short treatment duration and follow-up. No previous study has assessed the effect of duration of testosterone treatment on these outcomes. We aimed to assess the association between long-term use of testosterone replacement therapy and mortality, cardiovascular events, and prostate cancer diagnoses, using a time-varying exposure analysis.  Methods:   We did a population-based matched cohort study of men aged 66 years or older newly treated with testosterone replacement therapy and controls matched for age, region of residence, comorbidity, diabetes status, and index year from 2007-12 in Ontario, Canada, using data from the Ontario Drug Benefit database, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database, the CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database, the Ontario Myocardial Infarction Database, the Ontario Diabetes Database, the Ontario Cancer Registry, and the Registered Persons database. We assessed the association between cumulative testosterone replacement therapy exposure and mortality, cardiovascular events, and prostate cancer using marginal models with a time-varying testosterone exposure.  Findings:   We included 10 311 men treated with testosterone replacement therapy and 28 029 controls between Jan 1, 2007, and June 30, 2012. Over a median follow-up of 5·3 years (IQR 3·6-7·5) in the testosterone replacement therapy group and 5·1 years (3·4-7·4) in the control group, patients treated with testosterone replacement therapy had lower mortality than did controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·84-0·93). Patients in the lowest tertile of testosterone exposure had increased risk of mortality (HR 1·11, 95% CI 1·03-1·20) and cardiovascular events (HR 1·26, 95% CI 1·09-1·46) compared with controls. By contrast, those in the highest tertile of testosterone exposure had decreased risk of mortality (HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·62-0·73) and cardiovascular events (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·72-0·98), with a significant trend across tertiles (p<0·0001). Risk of prostate cancer diagnosis was decreased for those with the highest tertile of exposure (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·45-0·80) compared with controls, but not for those with the shortest exposure.  Interpretation:   Long-term exposure to testosterone replacement therapy was associated with reduced risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, and prostate cancer. However, testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events with short durations of therapy. In view of the limitations of observational data and the potential for selection bias, these results warrant confirmation in a randomised trial.

Methods:   Using the SEER-Medicare-linked database, we identified survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers who were diagnosed in 2004, enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service for at least 12 months before diagnosis, and survived ≥ 3 years. Quality of care was assessed using nine process indicators for chronic conditions, and a composite indicator representing seven avoidable outcomes. Total costs on the basis of Medicare amount paid were grouped as inpatient and outpatient. We examined the association between care quality and costs for cancer survivors, and compared this association among 2:1 frequency-matched noncancer controls, using comparisons of means and generalized linear regressions.  Results:   Our sample included 8,661 cancer survivors and 17,332 matched noncancer controls. Receipt of recommended care was associated with higher outpatient costs for eight indicators, and higher inpatient and total costs for five indicators. For three measures (visit every 6 months for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, and glycosylated hemoglobin or fructosamine every 6 months for patients with diabetes), costs for cancer survivors who received recommended care increased less than for noncancer controls. The absence of avoidable events was associated with lower costs of each type. An annual eye examination for patients with diabetes was associated with lower inpatient costs.  Conclusion:   Higher-quality processes of care may not reduce short-term costs, but the prevention of avoidable outcomes reduces costs. The association between quality and cost was similar for cancer survivors and noncancer controls.""","""['Kevin D Frick', 'Claire F Snyder', 'Robert J Herbert', 'Amanda L Blackford', 'Bridget A Neville', 'Antonio C Wolff', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Craig C Earle']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Quality of care for comorbid conditions during the transition to survivorship: differences between cancer survivors and noncancer controls.', 'Evaluation of trends in the cost of initial cancer treatment.', 'Estimating Costs of Care Attributable to Cancer: Does the Choice of Comparison Group Matter?', 'Cost of care for elderly cancer patients in the United States.', 'Prostate cancer management costs vary by disease stage at presentation.']"""

Here the cytotoxic and apoptogenic activity of methanol extracts, n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and acqueous extracts and the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of the plant were evaluated with PC3, DU-145 and MCF-7 cell lines. Cell viability, histograms of PI stained fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells and Western blot analysis of proteins involved in the cascade of apoptosis were compared in all samples. Thirty components were identified as volatile, representing 99.7% of essential oil composition after GC-MS analysis of the oil obtained from aerial parts of the N. cataria by hydro-distillation. The major oil components of the essential oil were nepetalactone stereoisomers. Comparing IC50 values showed estrogen receptor positive PC3 cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of N. cataria in comparison with low hormone-receptor presenting DU-145 cells. Among multiple extracts and essential oils of the plant, only the ethyl acetate extract could significantly decrease cell viability in PC3 cells, in a concentration dependent manner. Ethyl acetate extract of N. cataria treated cells showed a sub-G1 peak in PC3 cells in a concentration dependent manner that indicates the involvement of an apoptotic process in ethyl acetate extract-induced cell death. Western blotting analysis showed that in PC3 cells treated with ethyl acetate (48 h) caspase 3 and PARP were cleaved to active forms. Overall, the results suggest that further analytical elucidation of N. cataria in respect to finding new cytotoxic chemicals with anti-tumor activity is warranted.""","""['Seyed Ahmad Emami', 'Javad Asili', 'Shima Hossein Nia', 'Rezvan Yazdian-Robati', 'Mehrdad Sahranavard', 'Zahra Tayarani-Najaran']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Analysis of the essential oil composition of three cultivated Nepeta species from Iran.', 'Essential oil composition of five Nepeta species cultivated in Lithuania and evaluation of their bioactivities, toxicity and antioxidant potential of hydrodistillation residues.', 'Fast gas chromatography characterisation of purified semiochemicals from essential oils of Matricaria chamomilla L.

To study the relationship between urbanization and cancer morbidity, we here applied quantile regression. This cross-sectional study was conducted for 9 cancers in 345 cities in 2007 in Iran. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the relationship between urbanization and cancer morbidity was investigated using quantile regression and least square regression. Fitting models were compared using AIC criteria. R (3.0.1) software and the Quantreg package were used for statistical analysis. With the quantile regression model all percentiles for breast, colorectal, prostate, lung and pancreas cancers demonstrated increasing incidence rate with urbanization. The maximum increase for breast cancer was in the 90th percentile (β=0.13, p-value<0.001), for colorectal cancer was in the 75th percentile (β=0.048, p-value<0.001), for prostate cancer the 95th percentile (β=0.55, p-value<0.001), for lung cancer was in 95th percentile (β=0.52, p-value=0.006), for pancreas cancer was in 10th percentile (β=0.011, p-value<0.001). For gastric, esophageal and skin cancers, with increasing urbanization, the incidence rate was decreased. The maximum decrease for gastric cancer was in the 90th percentile(β=0.003, p-value<0.001), for esophageal cancer the 95th (β=0.04, p-value=0.4) and for skin cancer also the 95th (β=0.145, p-value=0.071). The AIC showed that for upper percentiles, the fitting of quantile regression was better than least square regression. According to the results of this study, the significant impact of urbanization on cancer morbidity requirs more effort and planning by policymakers and administrators in order to reduce risk factors such as pollution in urban areas and ensure proper nutrition recommendations are made.""","""['Somayeh Momenyan', 'Majid Sadeghifar', 'Fatemeh Sarvi', 'Mahmoud Khodadost', 'Alireza Mosavi-Jarrahi', 'Mohammad Ebrahim Ghaffari', 'Eghbal Sekhavati']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The examination of relationship between socioeconomic factors and number of tuberculosis using quantile regression model for count data in Iran 2010-2011.', 'Incidence Trend and Epidemiology of Common Cancers in the Center of Iran.', 'The relationship between population density and cancer mortality in Taiwan.', 'Cancer burden with ageing population in urban regions in China: projection on cancer registry data from World Health Organization.', 'Quantile regression for survival data in modern cancer research: expanding statistical tools for precision medicine.', 'Pancreatic Cancer in Iran - Result of the Iranian National Cancer Registry Program.', 'Corrected and Republished from: Socioeconomic Predictors of Trends in Cancer Mortality Among Municipalities in Japan, 2010-2019.', 'Predictors of survival rate in patients with pancreatic cancer: A multi-center analytical study in Iran.', 'National and Subnational Cancer Incidence for 22 Cancer Groups, 2000 to 2016: A Study Based on Cancer Registration Data of Iran.', 'Socioeconomic Predictors of Trends in Cancer Mortality among Municipalities in Japan, 2010-2019.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate trends in incidence of ten common cancers in Iran, based on the national cancer registry reports from 2004 to 2009. This epidemiological study was carried out based on existing age-standardized estimate cancer data from the national report on cancer registry/Ministry of Health in Iran. The obtained data were analyzed by test for linear trend and P ≥ 0.05 was taken as the significant level. Totals of 41,169 and 32,898 cases of cancer were registered in men and females, respectively, during these years. Overall age-standard incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population according to primary site weres 125.6 and 113.4 in males and females, respectively. Between 2004 and 2009, the ten most common cancers (excluding skin cancer) were stomach (16.2), bladder (12.6), prostate (11), colon-rectum (10.14), hematopoeitic system (7.1), lung (6.1), esophagus (6.4), brain (3.2), lymph node (3.8) and larynx (3.4) in males; and in females were breast (27.4), colon-rectum (9.3), stomach (7.6), esophagus (6.4), hematopoeitic system (4.9), thyroid (3.9), ovary (3.6), corpus uteri (2.9), bladder (3.2) and lung (2.6). Moreover, results showed that skin cancer was estimated as the most common cancer in both sexes. The lowest and the highest incidence in females and males were reported respectively in 2004 and 2009. Over this period, the incidence of cancer in both sexes has been significantly increasing (p<0.01). Like other less developed and epidemiologically transitioning countries, the trend of age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in Iran is rising. Due to the increasing trends, the future burden of cancer in the Iran is going to be acute with the expected increases in aging populations.

Is it possible to reduce the percentage of unexpected LNI patients (nomogram false negative)? We used the isotopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique systematically associated with laparoscopic ePLND to assess the potential value of isotopic SLN method to adress this point.  Methods:   Two hundred and two consecutive patients had procedures with isotopic SLN detection associated with laparoscopic ePLND for high or intermediate risk of PC. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to quantify the accuracy of different models as: the updated Briganti nomogram, the percentage of positive cores, and an equation of the best predictors of LNI. We tested the model cutoffs associated with an optimal negative predictive value (NPV) and the best cutoff associated with avoiding false negative SLN detection, in order to assist the clinician's decision of when to spare ePLND.  Results:   LNI was detected in 35 patients (17.2 %). Based on preoperative primary Gleason grade and percentage of positive cores, a bivariate model was built to calculate a combined score reflecting the risk of LNI. For the Briganti nomogram, the 5 % probability cutoff avoided ePLND in 53 % (108/202) of patients, missing three LNI patients (8.6 %), but all were detected by the SLN technique. For our bivariate model, the best cutoff was <10, leaving no patient with LNI due to positive SLN detection (four patients = 11.4 %), and avoiding ePLND in 52 % (105/202) of patients.  Conclusion:   For patients with a low risk of LNI determined using the updated Briganti nomogram or bivariate model, SLN technique could be used alone for lymph node staging in intermediate- or high-risk PC patients.""","""['Caroline Rousseau', 'Thierry Rousseau', 'Cédric Mathieu', 'Jacques Lacoste', 'Eric Potiron', 'Geneviève Aillet', 'Pierre Nevoux', 'Georges Le Coguic', 'Loïc Campion', 'Françoise Kraeber-Bodéré']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['External validation of the updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection: the essential importance of percentage of positive cores.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

The authors investigated whether genetic polymorphisms along the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism pathways are associated with androgen concentrations or with the risk of prostate cancer or high-grade disease from finasteride treatment.  Methods:   A nested case-control study from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial using data from men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer (cases) and a group of biopsy-negative, frequency-matched controls was conducted to investigate the association of 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes of the androgen pathway with overall (total), low-grade, and high-grade prostate cancer incidence and serum hormone concentrations.  Results:   There were significant associations of genetic polymorphisms in steroid 5α-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) (reference SNPs: rs3736316, rs3822430, rs1560149, rs248797, and rs472402) and SRD5A2 (rs2300700) with the risk of high-grade prostate cancer in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial; 2 SNPs were significantly associated with an increased risk (SRD5A1 rs472402 [odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.75; Ptrend = .03] and SRD5A2 rs2300700 [odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.18; Ptrend = .01]). Eleven SNPs in SRD5A1, SRD5A2, cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1), and CYP3A4 were associated with modifying the mean concentrations of serum androgen and sex hormone-binding globulin; and 2 SNPs (SRD5A1 rs824811 and CYP1B1 rs10012; Ptrend < .05) consistently and significantly altered all androgen concentrations. Several SNPs (SRD5A1 rs3822430, SRD5A2 rs2300700, CYP3A43 rs800672, and CYP19 rs700519; Ptrend < .05) were significantly associated with both circulating hormone levels and prostate cancer risk.

The present study aimed to investigate the possible origin of prostate CAFs and the effects of estrogen receptors, G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) and estrogen receptor (ER)-α, on stromal cell activation. High expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CD44, and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain B (SMemb) accompanied by low expression of smooth muscle differentiation markers was found in the stromal cells of PCa tissues and in cultured human prostate CAFs. Additionally, SMemb expression, which is coupled to cell phenotype switching and proliferation, was coexpressed with FAP, a marker of activated stromal cells, and with the stem cell marker CD44 in the stromal cells of PCa tissue. Prostate CAFs showed high GPR30 and low ERα expression. Moreover, GPR30 was coexpressed with FAP, CD44, and SMemb. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the overexpression of GPR30 or the knockdown of ERα in prostate stromal cells induced the up-regulation of FAP, CD44, Smemb, and the down-regulation of smooth muscle markers. The conditioned medium from these cells promoted the proliferation and migration of LNCaP and PC3 PCa cells. GPR30 knockdown or ERα overexpression showed opposite effects. Finally, we present a novel mechanism whereby GPR30 limits ERα expression via inhibition of the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway. These results suggest that stem-like cells within the stroma are a possible source of prostate CAFs and that the negative regulation of ERα expression by GPR30 is centrally involved in prostate stromal cell activation.""","""['Bona Jia', 'Yu Gao', 'Mingming Li', 'Jiandang Shi', 'Yanfei Peng', 'Xiaoling Du', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Natalie Sampson', 'Yongmei Shen', 'Mengyang Liu', 'Ju Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) mediates gene expression changes and growth response to 17beta-estradiol and selective GPR30 ligand G-1 in ovarian cancer cells.', 'The G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 inhibits proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.', 'GPR30-mediated HMGB1 upregulation in CAFs induces autophagy and tamoxifen resistance in ERα-positive breast cancer cells.', 'Estrogen receptor signaling in prostate cancer: Implications for carcinogenesis and tumor progression.', 'Non-genomic oestrogen receptor signal in B lymphocytes: An approach towards therapeutic interventions for infection, autoimmunity and cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.', 'Identifying Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A As a Potential Biomarker for the Carcinogenesis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'The ERα-NRF2 signalling axis promotes bicalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.', 'ELOVL gene family plays a virtual role in response to breeding selection and lipid deposition in different tissues in chicken (Gallus gallus).', 'The Impact of Estrogen and Estrogen-Like Molecules in Neurogenesis and Neurodegeneration: Beneficial or Harmful?']"""

Here, we present the preclinical application of PSMA I&T, a DOTAGA-chelated urea-based PSMA inhibitor, for SPECT/CT imaging and radionuclide therapy of PCa.

SPECT/CT clearly visualized subcutaneous tumors and sub-millimeter intraperitoneal metastases; however, high renal and spleen uptake in control mice (no 2-PMPA) interfered with visualization of metastases in the vicinity of those organs. Coadministration of 2-PMPA increased the tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio during (177)Lu-PSMA I&T radionuclide therapy. Hence, at equivalent absorbed dose to the tumor (36 Gy), coinjection of 2-PMPA decreased absorbed dose to the kidneys from 30 Gy to 12 Gy. Mice injected with (177)Lu-PSMA I&T only, showed signs of nephrotoxicity at 3 months after therapy, whereas mice injected with (177)Lu-PSMA I&T + 2-PMPA did not.

The probe positioning at the perineum could lead to a compression and shift of the penile bulb (PB) toward the high-dose region. Dose to the PB has been reported to be associated with the risk of posttreatment erectile dysfunction. This planning study reports on PB translations and changes in volume and dose when applying the transperineal ultrasound probe.  Methods and materials:   For 10 patients treated with external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer between 2013 and 2014, a planning computed tomography scan with and without the ultrasound probe in place was acquired. The planning target volume and organs at risk including the PB were contoured in the computed tomography scan with and without the probe. Radiation therapy plans for both scenarios were calculated. In a second step, for planning with the probe in position, an additional objective for improved sparing of the PB was introduced.  Results:   The median PB volume was 5.5 mL (range, 3.8-7.1 mL) without the probe and 3.5 mL (range, 2.0-5.8 mL) with the probe. The median shift of the PB was 1 mm in the posterior (range, 3 mm posterior-2 mm anterior) and 6 mm in the superior direction (range, 0-14 mm superior), with no relevant shift of the prostate. The median mean dose in 95% of the PB was 34.1 Gy (range, 6.0-50.4 Gy), 48.3 Gy (range, 7.2-56.8 Gy), and 39.4 Gy (range, 5.6-51.3 Gy) for plans without probe, with probe, and with probe and additional planning objective, respectively.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of cell cycle stage on cancer freeze response as well as investigate the potential cellular kinetic effect of calcitriol, the active metabolic of vitamin D3, when used as a cryosensitizing adjuvant in order to maximize prostate cancer cell death.  Methods:   Cell cycle distribution of PC-3 cells was analyzed via flow cytometry to compare gap 1, synthesis, and gap 2/mitosis phase subpopulations pre- and postfreeze as well as changes elicited by calcitriol pretreatment. Distinct gap 1, synthesis, and gap 2/mitosis phase populations were obtained through fluorescence-activated cell sorting and synthesis phase thymidine synchronization. Posttreatment viability was assessed using alamarBlue and fluorescence microscopy to assess live, apoptotic, and necrotic subpopulations.  Results:   A small but statistically significant increase in synthesis phase and decrease in gap 2/mitosis phase populations was noted at 6 hours postfreeze in asynchronous samples. Synchronization in synthesis phase yielded an increase in cell death when combined with freezing to both -15°C and -20°C. Calcitriol pretreatment increased the gap 1 phase population by 20% and a synergistic decrease in viability following freezing. However, gap 1-sorted populations combined with calcitriol treatment did not exhibit this synergistic effect. Fluorescence microscopy of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted cells revealed necrosis as the predominant form of cell death in all phases, though apoptosis did play a role.  Conclusion:   Although initial results suggested a potential sensitivity, PC-3 cells exposed to freezing as sorted populations did not reveal significant differences in cell death.

Plasmin can also degrade IgG thereby exposing C-terminal lysine residues. Previously, we have found IgG specifically bounded to Pg in the plasma of patients with malignant tumors.  Aim:   To identify IgG degraded by plasmin in the plasma of cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   Methods of ELISA were used for comparative research of levels of IgG bound to Pg in plasma of patients with the prostate cancer (PC, n=25) and lung cancer (LC, n=17). Plasma of healthy donors (n=29) was used as control. All patients signed informed consent for participation in this study. Affinity chromatography on Pg-sepharose was used for the quantification of IgG. Carboxypeptidase was used for remove of C-terminal lysine residues of the IgG. The program ATTESTAT was used for nonparametric analysis.  Results:   The frequency of occurence of elevated levels of IgG to Pg in plasma was detected in 68% of patients with PC, 59% of patients with LC and only 12% of healthy women and 10% of healthy men. The quantification of antibodies in plasma samples showed that the quantity of IgG to Pg in patients with PC was 27% from the total amount of IgG and in healthy men - 9%. Treatment of diluted plasma samples with carboxypeptidase B abolished the elevated levels of IgG to Pg, as well as the specific activity of the purified IgG to Pg-sepharose.  Conclusions:   C-terminal lysine residues which are formed as a result of degradation of native IgG with plasmin can bind to lysine binding sites on the kringle domains of Pg.

Objective:   To evaluate the activity and safety of apalutamide in patients with high-risk nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a multicenter phase 2 study of nmCRPC patients with a high risk for progression (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥8 ng/ml or PSA doubling time [PSA DT] ≤10 mo).  Intervention:   Patients received 240mg/d apalutamide while continuing on androgen-deprivation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary end point was 12-wk PSA response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria). Secondary end points included safety, time to PSA progression (TTPP), and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results and limitations:   A total of 51 patients were enrolled; four patients with metastatic disease were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Patient characteristics included median age, 71 yr; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 (76%); Gleason score ≤7 (57%); median PSA 10.7 ng/ml; and PSA DT ≤10 mo (45%). At median follow-up of 28.0 mo, 18 patients (35%) remained in the study. Overall, 89% of patients had ≥50% PSA decline at 12 wk. Median TTPP was 24.0 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.3 mo-not reached [NR]); median MFS was NR (95% CI, 33.4 mo-NR).

Objective:   We established and characterized patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) to assess their biological properties and to apply these to test the efficacies of drugs.  Design, setting, and participants:   CRCs were established from seven patient samples with disease ranging from primary PCa to advanced castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). The CRCs were characterized by genomic, transcriptomic, protein expression, and drug profiling.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The phenotypic quantification of the CRCs was done based on immunostaining followed by image analysis with Advanced Cell Classifier using Random Forest supervised machine learning. Copy number aberrations (CNAs) were called from whole-exome sequencing and transcriptomics using in-house pipelines. Dose-response measurements were used to generate multiparameter drug sensitivity scores using R-statistical language.  Results and limitations:   We generated six benign CRC cultures which all had an androgen receptor-negative, basal/transit-amplifying phenotype with few CNAs. In three-dimensional cell culture, these cells could re-express the androgen receptor. The CRCs from a CRPC patient (HUB.5) displayed multiple CNAs, many of which were shared with the parental tumor. We carried out high-throughput drug-response studies with 306 emerging and clinical cancer drugs. Using the benign CRCs as controls, we identified the Bcl-2 family inhibitor navitoclax as the most potent cancer-specific drug for the CRCs from a CRPC patient. Other drug efficacies included taxanes, mepacrine, and retinoids.  Conclusions:   Comprehensive cancer pharmacopeia-wide drug testing of CRCs from a CRPC patient highlighted both known and novel drug sensitivities in PCa, including navitoclax, which is currently being tested in clinical trials of CRPC.

We performed an analysis of a database of patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed by two urologists from 2011 to 2013. Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) activation and strength were graded by a trained pelvic floor physiotherapist. Patients were given an exercise program, grouped according to the strength of their pelvic floor as graded by assessment, to complete before and after surgery. PFM strength was recorded preoperatively, 4 days post-catheter removal and 4 weeks post-catheter removal. Continence was recorded at 4 weeks postop and was defined as the requirement of no continence aids. A total of 98 patients had RARP and a preoperative physiotherapy assessment plus postoperative appointments at around 1 and 4 weeks post-RARP. The majority of men improved their PFM strength regardless of preoperative strength with no significant predictors of postoperative strength found.

Salvage radiotherapy delays the need for more aggressive treatment such as long-term androgen suppression, but fewer than half of patients benefit from it. We aimed to establish the effect of adding short-term androgen suppression at the time of salvage radiotherapy on biochemical outcome and overall survival in men with rising PSA following radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   This open-label, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, was done in 43 French study centres. We enrolled men (aged ≥18 years) who had received previous treatment for a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (but no previous androgen deprivation therapy or pelvic radiotherapy), and who had stage pT2, pT3, or pT4a (bladder neck involvement only) in patients who had rising PSA of 0·2 to less than 2·0 μg/L following radical prostatectomy, without evidence of clinical disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally via an interactive web response system to standard salvage radiotherapy (three-dimensional [3D] conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, of 66 Gy in 33 fractions 5 days a week for 7 weeks) or radiotherapy plus short-term androgen suppression using 10·8 mg goserelin by subcutaneous injection on the first day of irradiation and 3 months later. Randomisation was stratified using a permuted block method according to investigational site, radiotherapy modality, and prognosis. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00423475.  Findings:   Between Oct 19, 2006, and March 30, 2010, 743 patients were randomly assigned, 374 to radiotherapy alone and 369 to radiotherapy plus goserelin. Patients assigned to radiotherapy plus goserelin were significantly more likely than patients in the radiotherapy alone group to be free of biochemical progression or clinical progression at 5 years (80% [95% CI 75-84] vs 62% [57-67]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·50, 95% CI 0·38-0·66; p<0·0001). No additional late adverse events occurred in patients receiving short-term androgen suppression compared with those who received radiotherapy alone. The most frequently occuring acute adverse events related to goserelin were hot flushes, sweating, or both (30 [8%] of 366 patients had a grade 2 or worse event; 30 patients [8%] had hot flushes and five patients [1%] had sweating in the radiotherapy plus goserelin group vs none of 372 patients in the radiotherapy alone group). Three (8%) of 366 patients had grade 3 or worse hot flushes and one patient had grade 3 or worse sweating in the radiotherapy plus goserelin group versus none of 372 patients in the radiotherapy alone group. The most common late adverse events of grade 3 or worse were genitourinary events (29 [8%] in the radiotherapy alone group vs 26 [7%] in the radiotherapy plus goserelin group) and sexual disorders (20 [5%] vs 30 [8%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred.  Interpretation:   Adding short-term androgen suppression to salvage radiotherapy benefits men who have had radical prostatectomy and whose PSA rises after a postsurgical period when it is undetectable. Radiotherapy combined with short-term androgen suppression could be considered as a reasonable option in this population.

In this patient group, the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or other local therapies against all active sites of disease revealed by 18F-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) could achieve sufficient prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control. However, a clear benefit of this procedure in terms of significant endpoints is yet to be demonstrated.

Materials and methods:   Relaxation times were calculated by fitting the pixel-wise intensities of acquired T 1- and T 2-weighted images from eight men with inversion-recovery and multi-echo multi-slice spin-echo sequences. A decision binary tree based on relaxation times was implemented to segment and classify fat, muscle, prostate, and air (within the body).

Results:   Relaxation times at 3 T are reported for fat (T 1 = 385 ms, T 2 = 121 ms), muscle (T 1 = 1295 ms, T 2 = 40 ms), and prostate (T 1 = 1700 ms, T 2 = 80 ms). The relaxation times allowed the segmentation-classification of fat, prostate, muscle, and air, and combined with anatomical knowledge, they allowed classification of bone. The good segmentation-classification of prostate [mean Dice similarity score (mDSC) = 0.70] suggests a viable implementation in oncology and that of fat (mDSC = 0.99), muscle (mDSC = 0.99), and bone (mDSCs = 0.78) advocates for its implementation in PET/MR attenuation correction.

However, how they are downregulated in prostate cancer is still not clear. In this study, we firstly investigated the association between miR-30a and miR-205 downregulation and hypoxia in prostate cancer. Then, we further investigated the regulative effect of miR-30a on TP53INP1 and autophagy-related radiosensitivity of process cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   The expression change of miR-30a, miR-205 and Dicer after hypoxic treatment were measured in DU145 and LNCaP cells. The effect of miR-30a and miR-205 on irradiation-induced autophagy and radiosensitivity of the cancer cells were also explored. The regulative effect of miR-30a on TP53INP1 expression and the effect of miR-30a/miR-205/TP53INP1 axis on autophagy and radiosensitivity regulation were further studied.  Results:   MiR-30a and miR-205 were downregulated under hypoxia as a result of impaired Dicer expression in DU145 and LNCaP cells. Enforced miR-30a and miR-205 expression attenuated irradiation-induced autophagy and also sensitized the cells to irradiation. Dual luciferase assay and following Western blot analysis showed that miR-30a directly targets 3'UTR of TP53INP1 and decreases its expression at protein level. Both miR-30a and miR-205 modulate radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells at least via TP53INP1.  Conclusions:   This study revealed that miR-30a and miR-205 are two hypoxia responsive miRNAs, which simultaneously target TP53INP1 and suppress its expression. The miR-30a/miR-205/TP53INP1 axis is involved in autophagy and radiosensitivity regulation, which represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['C-G Xu', 'M-F Yang', 'J-X Fan', 'W Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['MiR-205 suppresses autophagy and enhances radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells by targeting TP53INP1.', 'Hypoxia-responsive miR-124 and miR-144 reduce hypoxia-induced autophagy and enhance radiosensitivity of\xa0prostate\xa0cancer cells via suppressing PIM1.', 'Hypoxia-Responsive Mir-301a and Mir-301b Promote Radioresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells via Downregulating NDRG2.', 'MicroRNA-21 is a novel promising target in cancer radiation therapy.', 'Autophagy in cancers including brain tumors: role of MicroRNAs.', 'Improving the prediction for the response to radiotherapy of clinical tumor samples by using combinatorial model of MicroRNA expression.', 'The expression of apoptosis related genes in HK-2 cells overexpressing PPM1K was determined by RNA-seq analysis.', 'Prediction of Response to Radiotherapy by Characterizing the Transcriptomic Features in Clinical Tumor Samples across 15 Cancer Types.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'The Influence of miRNAs on Radiotherapy Treatment in Prostate Cancer - A Systematic Review.']"""

Docetaxel monotherapy offers promising results with a tolerable toxicity profile. However, enhancing the clinical index of Docetaxel-based therapy remains the ultimate goal. Methods We conducted a phase II, open label, multinational prospective trial to evaluate the efficacy of weekly Docetaxel combined with Zoledronic acid and Celecoxib. Eligible patients received 25 mg/m(2) Docetaxel weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 4 weeks, 4 mg Zoledronic acid every 4 weeks, and 200 mg oral Celecoxib twice daily. Enrollment was terminated prematurely upon the publication of reports of cardiac toxicity associated with cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitors. Results Our study enrolled 22 patients with a median of 4.7 cycles per patient. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months (range 0.7 to 24.1 months) with 36 % and 4.5 % survival rates at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Our patients had a biologic response in 40.1 % of cases and a palliative response in 72.7 %. Among the eight patients with measurable disease, three had partial responses, two had stable disease, and three had progressive disease, leading to a response rate (RR) of 62.5 %. The observed toxicities were mild and limited to grade 3 events. Nine patients had anemia (40.1 %), 5 had sensory neuropathy (22.7 %) and 2 had stomatitis (9.1 %).

We assessed the influence of surgeon gender on patient gender demographics by exploring the surgical case logs of American urologists.  Materials and methods:   Six-month case logs of certifying urologists from 2003 to 2012 were obtained from the ABU (American Board of Urology). We reviewed case logs based on CPT codes of common urological procedures, focusing on 6 index gender neutral and gender specific procedure groups, including treatment of nephrolithiasis, nephrectomy, resection of bladder tumors, treatment of stress urinary incontinence, elective sterilization and treatment of prostate cancer.  Results:   Among a cohort of 6,166 urologists 1,011,800 cases were logged. Female surgeons operated on a significantly higher percent of female patients than their male peers (54.4% vs 32.5%, p <0.01). Female surgeons performed significantly more female specific procedures, such as slings, than their male counterparts (18 vs 10 per year, p <0.001). Male urologists performed significantly more male specific procedures than their female colleagues, including 3 times as many vasectomies (32 vs 12 per year, p <0.001) and more than twice as many prostatectomies (15 vs 6 per year, p <0.001). These trends were consistent across all subspecialties and geographic regions (p <0.01).

TRPV1 overstimulation selectively ablates capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons in animal models in vivo. The cytotoxic mechanisms are based on strong Na(+) and Ca(2+) influx via TRPV1 channels, which leads to mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation and necrotic cell swelling. Increased TRPV1 expression levels are also observed in breast and prostate cancer and derived cell lines. Here, we examined whether potent agonist-induced overstimulation mediated by TRPV1 might represent a means for the eradication of prostate carcinoma (PC-3, Du 145, LNCaP) and breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT-474) cells in vitro. While rat sensory neurons were highly vanilloid-sensitive, normal rat prostate epithelial cells were resistant in vivo. We found TRPV1 to be expressed in all cancer cell lines at mRNA and protein levels, yet protein expression levels were significantly lower compared to sensory neurons. Treatment of all human carcinoma cell lines with capsaicin didn't lead to overstimulation cytotoxicity in vitro. We assume that the low vanilloid-sensitivity of prostate and breast cancer cells is associated with low expression levels of TRPV1, since ectopic TRPV1 expression rendered them susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of vanilloids evidenced by plateau-type Ca(2+) signals, mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation and Na(+)- and Ca(2+)-dependent membrane disorganization. Moreover, long-term monitoring revealed that merely the ectopic expression of TRPV1 stopped cell proliferation and often induced apoptotic processes via strong activation of caspase-3 activity.

The images were fused, radioactive seeds and US probe locations were determined on the CT, and prostate, bladder, and rectal contours were drawn on the US. Dose rates (cGy/h) were calculated for the portion of the US probe spanning the prostate for several dose-volume histogram parameters.  Results:   Twenty patients were treated with (125)I and 82 patients with (103)Pd. Average dose rates at Day 0 to the portion of the US probe spanning the prostate were 2.1 ± 1.3 cGy/h and 2.5 ± 0.8 cGy/h for patients treated with (125)I and (103)Pd, respectively.

Conclusions:   During the immediate weeks after prostate seed implant, the estimated intrarectal dose rates are higher in (103)Pd compared to (125)I. As (103)Pd decays faster than (125)I, 2 months after the implant, radiation exposure from (103)Pd becomes lower than (125)I.

Objective:   To understand how NEPC develops and to identify driver genes to inform therapy for NEPC prevention.  Design, setting, and participants:   Whole-transcriptome sequencing data were extracted from prostate tumors from two independent cohorts: The Beltran cohort contained 27 adenocarcinoma and five NEPC patient samples, and the Vancouver Prostate Centre cohort contained three patient samples and nine patient-derived xenografts.  Intervention:   A novel bioinformatics tool, comparative alternative splicing detection (COMPAS), was invented to analyze alternative RNA splicing on RNA-sequencing data.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   COMPAS identified potential driver genes for NEPC development. Biochemical and biological validations were performed in both prostate cell and tumor models.  Results and limitation:   More than 66% of the splice events were predicted to be regulated by the RNA splicing factor serine/arginine repetitive matrix 4 (SRRM4). In vitro and in vivo evidence confirmed that one SRRM4 target gene was the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a master regulator of neurogenesis. Moreover, SRRM4 strongly stimulated adenocarcinoma cells to express NEPC biomarkers, and this effect was exacerbated by ARPI. ARPI combined with a gain of SRRM4-induced adenocarcinoma cells to assume multicellular spheroid morphology and was essential in establishing progressive NEPC xenografts.

However, selecting ever-smokers for screening using individualized lung cancer risk calculations may be more effective and efficient than current USPSTF recommendations.  Objective:   Comparison of modeled outcomes from risk-based CT lung-screening strategies vs USPSTF recommendations.  Design, setting, and participants:   Empirical risk models for lung cancer incidence and death in the absence of CT screening using data on ever-smokers from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO; 1993-2009) control group. Covariates included age; education; sex; race; smoking intensity, duration, and quit-years; body mass index; family history of lung cancer; and self-reported emphysema. Model validation in the chest radiography groups of the PLCO and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST; 2002-2009), with additional validation of the death model in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 1997-2001), a representative sample of the United States. Models were applied to US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years (NHIS 2010-2012) to estimate outcomes of risk-based selection for CT lung screening, assuming screening for all ever-smokers, yield the percent changes in lung cancer detection and death observed in the NLST.  Exposures:   Annual CT lung screening for 3 years beginning at age 50 years.  Main outcomes and measures:   For model validity: calibration (number of model-predicted cases divided by number of observed cases [estimated/observed]) and discrimination (area under curve [AUC]). For modeled screening outcomes: estimated number of screen-avertable lung cancer deaths and estimated screening effectiveness (number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent 1 lung cancer death).  Results:   Lung cancer incidence and death risk models were well calibrated in PLCO and NLST. The lung cancer death model calibrated and discriminated well for US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years (NHIS 1997-2001: estimated/observed = 0.94 [95%CI, 0.84-1.05]; AUC, 0.78 [95%CI, 0.76-0.80]). Under USPSTF recommendations, the models estimated 9.0 million US ever-smokers would qualify for lung cancer screening and 46,488 (95% CI, 43,924-49,053) lung cancer deaths were estimated as screen-avertable over 5 years (estimated NNS, 194 [95% CI, 187-201]). In contrast, risk-based selection screening of the same number of ever-smokers (9.0 million) at highest 5-year lung cancer risk (≥1.9%) was estimated to avert 20% more deaths (55,717 [95% CI, 53,033-58,400]) and was estimated to reduce the estimated NNS by 17% (NNS, 162 [95% CI, 157-166]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Among a cohort of US ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years, application of a risk-based model for CT screening for lung cancer compared with a model based on USPSTF recommendations was estimated to be associated with a greater number of lung cancer deaths prevented over 5 years, along with a lower NNS to prevent 1 lung cancer death.""","""['Hormuzd A Katki', 'Stephanie A Kovalchik', 'Christine D Berg', 'Li C Cheung', 'Anil K Chaturvedi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA""","""['Who Should Be Screened for Lung Cancer?

APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET)) is the first clinical-stage compound that reactivates mutant p53 protein by refolding it to wild type conformation, thus inducing apoptosis. APR-246 has been tested as monotherapy in a Phase I/IIa clinical study in hematological malignancies and prostate cancer with promising results, and a Phase Ib/II study in combination with platinum-based therapy in ovarian cancer is ongoing. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of APR-246 in combination with conventional chemotherapy in primary cancer cells isolated from ascitic fluid from 10 ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients, 8 of which had HGS cancer.  Methods:   Cell viability was assessed with fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and Combination Index was calculated using the Additive model. p53 status was determined by Sanger sequencing and single strand conformation analysis, and p53 protein expression by western blotting.  Results:   We observed strong synergy with APR-246 and cisplatin in all tumor samples carrying a TP53 missense mutation, while synergistic or additive effects were found in cells with wild type or TP53 nonsense mutations. Strong synergy was also observed with carboplatin or doxorubicin. Moreover, APR-246 sensitized TP53 mutant primary ovarian cancer cells, isolated from a clinically platinum-resistant patient, to cisplatin; the IC50 value of cisplatin decreased 3.6 fold from 6.5 to 1.8 μM in the presence of clinically relevant concentration of APR-246.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that combination treatment with APR-246 and DNA-damaging drugs could significantly improve the treatment of patients with TP53 mutant HGS cancer, and thus provide strong support for the ongoing clinical study with APR-246 in combination with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent HGS cancer.""","""['Åsa Fransson', 'Daria Glaessgen', 'Jessica Alfredsson', 'Klas G Wiman', 'Svetlana Bajalica-Lagercrantz', 'Nina Mohell']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Ovarian Res""","""['APR-246 overcomes resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Assessment of TP53 mutation using purified tissue samples of ovarian serous carcinomas reveals a higher mutation rate than previously reported and does not correlate with drug resistance.', 'TP53 oncomorphic mutations predict resistance to platinum‑ and taxane‑based standard chemotherapy in patients diagnosed with advanced serous ovarian carcinoma.', 'Mutant p53 as a target for cancer treatment.', 'Targeting of Mutant p53 and the Cellular Redox Balance by APR-246 as a Strategy for Efficient Cancer Therapy.', 'TP53-Mutated Myelodysplasia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'APR-246 Enhances Colorectal Cancer Sensitivity to Radiotherapy.', 'DNA Damage Response Alterations in Ovarian Cancer: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Drugs Targeting p53 Mutations with FDA Approval and in Clinical Trials.', 'The potential effects and mechanisms of Gegen Qinlian Decoction in oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer based on network pharmacology.']"""

Herein, we have investigated the roles of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) in stemness of prostate cancer cells. Both PDE5 and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein-1 (TAZ), a core effector of Hippo pathway, are highly expressed in the PC3-derived cancer stem cells (PCSC). Either TAZ knockdown or inhibition of PDE5 activity attenuated colony formation, altered expression patterns of stem cell markers, and enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity, resulting in attenuation of stemness in PCSC. In addition, inhibition of PDE5 activity by its specific inhibitors activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), which in turn induces MST/LATS kinases, resulting in cytosolic degradation of TAZ and activation of Hippo pathway. Accordingly, knockdown of TAZ almost completely abolished PDE5 inhibitor-induced attenuation in stemness in cultured PCSC, whereas knockdown of TAZ not only abolished PDE5 inhibitor-induced attenuation in stemness but also facilitated PDE5 inhibitor-induced trans-differentiation in PCSC xenografts. Together, the present study has uncovered that PDE/cGMP/PKG signal targets to Hippo/TAZ pathway in maintaining stemness of PCSC, and suggested that PDE5 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents could effectively prevent initiation, metastasis, and relapse of prostate cancer.""","""['Naihua Liu', 'Liu Mei', 'Xueying Fan', 'Chao Tang', 'Xing Ji', 'Xinhua Hu', 'Wei Shi', 'Yu Qian', 'Musaddique Hussain', 'Junsong Wu', 'Chaojun Wang', 'Shaoqiang Lin', 'Ximei Wu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Activation of cGMP/PKG/p65 signaling associated with PDE5-Is downregulates CCL5 secretion by CD8 + T cells in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Sulindac selectively inhibits colon tumor cell growth by activating the cGMP/PKG pathway to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Essential role of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway in regulating the proliferation and survival of human renal carcinoma cells.', ""Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors as novel agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."", 'The Hippo Pathway as Drug Targets in Cancer Therapy and Regenerative Medicine.', 'SUMOylation of Rho-associated protein kinase 2 induces goblet cell metaplasia in allergic airways.', 'Once upon a Testis: The Tale of Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase in Testicular Cancers.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'In Vitro Drug Repurposing: Focus on Vasodilators.', 'Hippo signaling activates hedgehog signaling by Taz-driven Gli3 processing.']"""

Evidence is derived from androgen-induced colony formation in the absence of cell-secreted factors or from studies involving forced AR overexpression in hormone-dependent cells. On the other hand, standard cell line models established from CRPC patient tumors (e.g., LNCaP and VCaP) are hormone-dependent and require selection pressure in castrated mice to re-emerge as CRPC cells and the resulting tumors then tend to be insensitive to the androgen antagonist enzalutamide. Therefore, we examined established CRPC model cells produced by castration of mice bearing hormone-dependent cell line xenografts including CRPC cells overexpressing full-length AR (C4-2) or co-expressing wtAR and splice-variant AR-V7 that is incapable of ligand binding (22Rv1). In standard colony formation assays, C4-2 cells were shown to be androgen-dependent and sensitive to enzalutamide whereas 22Rv1 cells were incapable of colony formation under identical conditions. However, both C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells formed colonies in conditioned media derived from the same cells or from HEK293 fibroblasts that were proven to lack androgenic activity. This effect was (i) not enhanced by androgen, (ii) insensitive to enzalutamide, (iii) dependent on AR (in C4-2) and on AR-V7 and wtAR (in 22Rv1) and (iv) sensitive to inhibitors of several signaling pathways, similar to androgen-stimulation. Therefore, during progression to CRPC in vivo, coordinate cellular changes accompanying overexpression of AR may enable cooperation between hormone-independent activity of AR and actions of cellular secretory factors to completely override androgen-dependence and sensitivity to drugs targeting hormonal factors.""","""['Mugdha Patki', 'Yanfang Huang', 'Manohar Ratnam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Effect of Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) inhibitors on androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Multimodal actions of the phytochemical sulforaphane suppress both AR and AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells: Advocating a potent pharmaceutical combination against castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The prognosis of lipid reprogramming with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in castrated Egyptian prostate cancer patients: Randomized trial.', 'Identification of ELK1 interacting peptide segments in the androgen receptor.', 'Strategy for Tumor-Selective Disruption of Androgen Receptor Function in the Spectrum of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hybrid Enzalutamide Derivatives with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity Decrease Heat Shock Protein 90 and Androgen Receptor Levels and Inhibit Viability in Enzalutamide-Resistant C4-2 Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

We tested the hypothesis that these markers could assist clinicians in the biopsy decision path of patients with tPSA>10ng/ml.  Methods:   The primary endpoint was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of PHI in determining the presence of PCa at biopsy in comparison to tPSA, free PSA, and % of free to total PSA. We calculated the number of prostate biopsies that could have been spared by using this marker to decide whether or not to perform a biopsy. A secondary endpoint was to determine the relationship between PHI and PCa characteristics.  Results:   The PCa was diagnosed in 136 of 262 patients (51.9%). Total PSA and PHI values were significantly higher (P<0.005) and % of free to total PSA values significantly lower (P<0.0001) in patients with PCa relative to those with a negative biopsy. In multivariable logistic regression models, PHI achieved the independent predictor status and significantly increased the accuracy of the base multivariable model by an extent of 8.2% (P = 0.0005).

However, efficient homing of the anti-tumoral T cells to the tumor or metastatic site still remains a substantial hurdle. Yet the tumor site itself attracts both tumor-promoting and anti-tumoral immune cell populations through the secretion of chemokines. We attempted to identify these chemokines in a model of spontaneous metastasis, in order to ""hijack"" their function by expressing matching chemokine receptors on the cytotoxic T cells used in ACT, thus allowing us to enhance the recruitment of these therapeutic cells. Here we show that this enabled the modified T cells to preferentially home into spontaneous lymph node metastases in the TRAMP model, as well as in an inducible tumor model, E.G7-OVA. Due to the improved homing, the modified CD8+ T cells displayed an enhanced in vivo protective effect, as seen by a significant delay in E.G7-OVA tumor growth. These results offer a proof of principle for the tailored application of chemokine receptor modification as a means of improving T cell homing to the target tumor, thus enhancing ACT efficacy. Surprisingly, we also uncover that the formation of the peri-tumoral fibrotic capsule, which has been shown to impede T cell access to tumor, is partially dependent on host T cell presence.

To further explore the association between DAB2IP and ionizing radiation (IR), PCa cells were fractionally irradiated 12 times with 2 Gy of γ‑rays and the change in DAB2IP mRNA expression was monitored. Notably, along with a continuous reduction of DAB2IP expression levels, increased expression levels of ataxia‑telangiectasia mutated (ATM) was observed in IR‑treated cells. In order to improve the sensitivity of DAB2IP‑deficient cells to IR, α‑particles, a type of high linear energy transfer radiation and KU55933, an ATM inhibitor, were used in the current study.

Patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer are often treated with paclitaxel, but most of them eventually develop drug resistance. S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box) type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. In the present study, we investigated the role of Skp2 in paclitaxel-resistant DU145-TxR or PC-3-TxR cells by Skp2 silencing or using Skp2 inhibitors. We first confirmed that Skp2 expression is up-regulated in DU145-TxR or PC-3-TxR cells compared with their parental cells DU145 or PC-3, respectively. Knockdown of Skp2 or Skp2 inhibitor treatment in DU145-TxR or PC-3-TxR cells restored paclitaxel sensitivity. E-cadherin was decreased while Vimentin was increased in PC-3-TxR or DU145-TxR cells.

Studies on potentially influencing variables, like time since diagnosis, cancer type, and sex, have yielded heterogeneous results. Also social support has rarely been examined as an influencing factor. This study aims to increase knowledge on these factors.  Method:   Analyses are based on cross-sectional data of long-term survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer (5-16 years postdiagnosis), recruited by 6 German population-based cancer registries. Six thousand fifty-seven women and men were included in the analyses. FoR was assessed using the short form of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire (FoP-Q-SF). The associations of cancer type, age, sex, time since diagnosis, and social support with moderate/high FoR were identified via multiple logistic regression analyses.  Results:   The majority of long-term cancer survivors reported experiencing FoR, mostly in low intensity. Female survivors, survivors ≤54 or 55-59 years of age, 5 to 7 years postdiagnosis, with a lower education, with recurrence/metastases, or being socially isolated were at greater risk to experience moderate/high FoR. Cancer type and stage at diagnosis did not reach statistical significance.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate a potential vulnerability for women to experience FoR in moderate/high severity. Also younger and socially isolated survivors were at greater risk to suffer from moderate/high levels of FoR and should thus be monitored for high levels of FoR and be offered the support needed to manage their fears.

This analysis examines the trends in cancer mortality across this 25-year challenge period from 1990 to 2015. In 2015, cancer death rates were 26% lower than in 1990 (32% lower among men and 22% lower among women). The 50% reduction goal was more fully met for the cancer sites for which there was enactment of effective approaches for prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. Among men, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 45%, for colorectal cancer by 47%, and for prostate cancer by 53%. Among women, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 8%, for colorectal cancer by 44%, and for breast cancer by 39%. Declines in the death rates of all other cancer sites were substantially smaller (13% among men and 17% among women). The major factors that accounted for these favorable trends were progress in tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment. As we embark on new national cancer goals, this recent past experience should teach us that curing the cancer problem will require 2 sets of actions: making new discoveries in cancer therapeutics and more completely applying those discoveries in cancer prevention we have already made.

The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin has been identified as a novel pro-angiogenic factor. Gremlin promotes neovascular responses via a BMP-independent activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR2). BMP antagonists may act as covalent or non-covalent homodimers or in a monomeric form, while VEGFRs ligands are usually dimeric. However, the oligomeric state of gremlin and its role in modulating the biological activity of the protein remain to be elucidated.Here we show that gremlin is expressed in vitro and in vivo both as a monomer and as a covalently linked homodimer. Mutagenesis of amino acid residue Cys141 prevents gremlin dimerization leading to the formation of gremlinC141A monomers. GremlinC141A monomer retains a BMP antagonist activity similar to the wild-type dimer, but is devoid of a significant angiogenic capacity. Notably, we found that gremlinC141A mutant engages VEGFR2 in a non-productive manner, thus acting as receptor antagonist. Accordingly, both gremlinC141A and wild-type monomers inhibit angiogenesis driven by dimeric gremlin or VEGF-A165. Moreover, by acting as a VEGFR2 antagonist, gremlinC141A inhibits the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of murine breast and prostate cancer cells in vivo.In conclusion, our data show that gremlin exists in multiple forms endowed with specific bioactivities and provide new insights into the molecular bases of gremlin dimerization.

MFX is the preferred choice in many developed countries. Evidence shows little difference in how effectively SFX and MFX reduce pain. However, SFX is associated with higher retreatment and (in one meta-analysis) pathological fracture rates. MFX is, however, more time-consuming and expensive. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of SFX versus MFX for metastatic bone pain in breast, prostate and lung cancer in New Zealand.  Methods:   We constructed a Markov microsimulation model to estimate health gain (in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs), health system costs (in real 2011 NZ dollars) and cost-effectiveness. The model was populated using effect estimates from randomized controlled trials and other studies, and New Zealand cancer and cost data. Disability weights from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study were used in estimating QALYs.  Results:   Across all three cancers, QALY gains were similar for SFX compared to MFX, and per patient costs were less for SFX than MFX, with a difference of NZ$1469 (95% uncertainty interval $1112 to $1886) for lung cancer, $1316 ($810 to $1854) for prostate cancer and $1344 ($855 to $1846) for breast cancer. Accordingly, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, SFX was the preferable treatment option. Various sensitivity analyses did not overturn the clear preference for SFX.  Conclusion:   For all three cancers, SFX was clearly more cost-effective than MFX. This adds to the case for desisting from offering MFX to patients with metastatic bone pain, from a cost-effectiveness angle.""","""['Lucie Collinson', 'Giorgi Kvizhinadze', 'Nisha Nair', 'Melissa McLeod', 'Tony Blakely']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis of single fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy compared with single fraction of external beam radiation therapy for palliation of vertebral bone metastases.', 'Single- versus multiple-fraction radiotherapy in patients with painful bone metastases: cost-utility analysis based on a randomized trial.', 'Cost Effectiveness of External Beam Radiation Therapy versus Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation for Palliation of Uncomplicated Bone Metastases.', 'The role of palliative external beam radiation therapy in boney metastases pain management.', 'The INTRABEAM® Photon Radiotherapy System for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Economic Evaluation of Palliative Care for Patients with Cancer Disease: A Systematic Review.', 'Personalized Radiation Therapy in Cancer Pain Management.', 'Palliative radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases at diagnosis: A hospital-based analysis of patterns of care, RT fractionation scheme, and overall survival.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Treatments for the Management of Bone Metastases: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC): A Review of Costing Evidence.']"""

Macrophages are abundant in bone and bone marrow and can influence both osteoblast and osteoclast function in physiology and pathology. Herein, we examined the role of macrophages in prostate cancer bone lesions, particularly the osteoblastic response. First, macrophage and lymphocyte distributions were qualitatively assessed in patient's prostate cancer skeletal lesions by immunohistochemistry. Second, macrophage functional contributions to prostate tumour growth in bone were explored using an immune-competent mouse model combined with two independent approaches to achieve in vivo macrophage depletion: liposome encapsulated clodronate that depletes phagocytic cells (including macrophages and osteoclasts); and targeted depletion of CD169(+) macrophages using a suicide gene knock-in model. Immunohistochemistry and histomorphometric analysis were performed to quantitatively assess cancer-induced bone changes. In human bone metastasis specimens, CD68(+) macrophages were consistently located within the tumour mass. Osteal macrophages (osteomacs) were associated with pathological woven bone within the metastatic lesions. In contrast, lymphocytes were inconsistently present in prostate cancer skeletal lesions and when detected, had varied distributions. In the immune-competent mouse model, CD169(+) macrophage ablation significantly inhibited prostate cancer-induced woven bone formation, suggesting that CD169(+) macrophages within pathological woven bone are integral to tumour-induced bone formation. In contrast, pan-phagocytic cell, but not targeted CD169(+) macrophage depletion resulted in increased tumour mass, indicating that CD169(-) macrophage subset(s) and/or osteoclasts influenced tumour growth. In summary, these observations indicate a prominent role for macrophages in prostate cancer bone metastasis that may be therapeutically targetable to reduce the negative skeletal impacts of this malignancy, including tumour-induced bone modelling.

However, various acquired mutations within the AR sequence often render this receptor resistant to treatment. Ligand-induced interaction between the N- and C-termini of the AR marks the initial step in the AR signaling cascade and can thus serve as an early read-out for analysis of potential antagonists of wt and mutant AR. To measure changes of the N/C interaction in the wt and mutant AR variants upon the addition of inhibitors, we applied our recently developed Fluorescent Two-Hybrid (F2H) assay. The F2H method enables real-time monitoring and quantitative analysis of the interactions between GFP- and RFP-tagged proteins in live mammalian cells, where GFP-tagged proteins are tethered to a specific nuclear location. This anchoring approach provides a local signal enrichment suitable for direct visualization of protein-protein interactions as co-localizations by conventional epifluorescence microscopy. Since the F2H assay is fully reversible, we could monitor dynamics of AR N/C interactions in living cells in real time upon agonistic, as well as antagonistic treatments. In dose-response F2H experiments, we compared the potencies of abiraterone, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, flutamide, and galeterone/TOK-001 to prevent the dihydrotestosterone-induced N/C interaction in wt AR. We further applied the newly developed F2H assay to analyze how the AR N/C interaction is affected by the clinically relevant mutations W741L, F876L, T877A and F876L/T877A. We conclude that F2H is a reliable and technically undemanding approach for straightforward screening of new AR modulators, as well as for monitoring their activity in real time in living cells.""","""['Jacqueline Bogner', 'Kourosh Zolghadr', 'Ian Hickson', 'Tina Romer', 'Larisa Yurlova']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Antiandrogens act as selective androgen receptor modulators at the proteome level in prostate cancer cells.', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Molecular Modeling Study of the Hydroxyflutamide Resistance Mechanism Induced by Androgen Receptor Mutations.']"""

This study presents the outcome for patients treated with LDR-BT at a single institution with focus on the association between dose and biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS).  Methods:   In total 195 patients were treated with LDR-BT between 2004 and 2008. The patients were followed systematically for side effects for at least one year. PSA levels were followed regularly from three months and for at least five years. Outcome was analyzed in relation to clinical variables at baseline and to radiotherapy data.  Results:   Kaplan-Meier estimated BFFS at five years was 95.7%. Dose to the prostate in terms of D90% was significantly associated with BFFS [HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.83-0.96), p = 0.002].  Conclusion:   Out data confirmed that absorbed dose is a predictive factor for BFFS for low-risk patients without androgen deprivation therapy.

Material and method:   We used an observational and retrospective design for the study. For each patient, we recorded clinical variables such as the extent (metastatic or locally advanced), Gleason score, age, date of diagnosis, date of last contact with the health system and the vital status during the last contact. We used univariate and multivariate statistical techniques of survival. The parametric survival methods enabled us to calculate the mean survival using extrapolation. We analysed 219 patients treated in the public health system between 2008 and 2011. The analysis showed statistically significant differences in survival depending on Gleason score, age and stage. The longest survival was in the subgroup younger than 75 years, with a local extent and a low-risk category on the Gleason scale (19.41 years), and the shortest survival (0.97 years) was in the 75 years or older group. The survival of the other subgroups ranged between these outliers.

Objective:   We set to evaluate the potential impact of LT on overall mortality (OM) in men with mPCa, and how this impact is influenced by tumor and patient characteristics.  Design, settings, and participants:   A total of 15 501 patients with mPCa were identified in the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2012) and categorized in LT (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy targeted to prostate) versus nonlocal treatment (NLT; all other patients).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The two arms (LT vs NLT) were matched using propensity scores to minimize selection bias. To evaluate LT impact on OM in relation to baseline characteristics, first multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to predict OM in patients treated with NLT, then interaction between predicted OM risk and LT status was tested.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 9.5% (n=1470) of patients received LT. In the postpropensity matched cohorts, 3-yr OM-free survival was higher in the LT group versus the NLT group (69% vs 54%; p<0.001). In multivariable Cox regression, the NLT group, age, and Charlson comorbidity index were predictors of OM (all p≤0.03). This model was used to predict the 3-yr OM risk. The interaction between predicted OM and LT status was significant (p<0.001). The benefit of LT on OM decreased progressively as predicted OM risk increased. Specifically, the 3-yr absolute improvement in OM-free survival was 15.7%, for patients with predicted OM risk ≤20% versus 0% for those with predicted OM risk ≥72%.  Conclusions:   Men with mPCa at diagnosis benefit from LT in terms of OM. This is largely affected by baseline characteristics. Specifically, patients with a relatively low tumor risk and good general health status appear to benefit the most.

Several clinical differences distinguish this subtype of prostate cancer by the conventional acinar adenocarcinoma: exophytic growth into the prostatic urethra, different clinical presentation, different sites of metastasis and more aggressiveness. The rarity of this tumour forced to base our knowledge on small case series or on individual case reports, and does not help to establish appropriate guidelines. Therefore, the diagnosis of this tumour masks clinical implications that are still not well-understood.We report the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of pure prostate ductal adenocarcinoma that early developed multiple metastases after radical prostatectomy. The patient started hormonal therapy with a fast biochemical and radiologic (positron emission tomography-computed tomography, PET-CT) hormonal escape. Therefore, we took the decision to perform chemotherapy with Taxotere along with prednisolone with a relative stability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, but a new PET-CT scan showed a further progression of the disease. Finally, the patient underwent therapy with Abiraterone acetate that did not stop the cancer progression.No therapeutic options available showed a good control of disease progression. PSA proved to be a poor marker while, on the contrary, PET-CT scan has proved to be particularly useful in the management of the disease progression.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CRP and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and radiological response in CRPC patients treated with docetaxel.  Methods:   115 histologically confirmed CRPC patients who were treated with docetaxel chemotherapy from 2008 to 2013 were selected. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to predict the association of CRP as a dichotomous variable with PFS and OS after chemotherapy initiation.  Results:   None of the clinicopathological features were associated with the CRP. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median PFS (9.8 vs. 7.5 months, p < 0.001) and OS (26.5 vs. 13.5 months, p = 0.002) were higher in patients who did not have an elevated CRP than in those with an elevated CRP. In univariable analysis, the pretreatment CRP was significantly associated with PFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p = 0.003).In multivariable analysis, patients with a CRP > 8 mg/l were at significantly higher risk of tumor progress (hazard ratio (HR) 2.184; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.401-3.403; p = 0.001) and death (HR 2.003; 95% CI 1.285-3.121; p = 0.002) than patients with a CRP ≤ 8 mg/l.

Methods:   The study included all men in Sweden with prostate cancer diagnosed in 1961-2008. Due to treatment standards, patients diagnosed in 1961-1980 were considered more exposed to estrogen, while those diagnosed in 1981-2008 were regarded less exposed. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the risk of biliary tract cancer in cohort members compared to the corresponding Swedish male population.  Results:   After 849 307 person-years of follow-up in 203 131 prostate cancer patients, there were 41 incident gallbladder cancers and 36 cancers of the extra-hepatic bile ducts. In overall, there were no apparent differences in the risk of gallbladder cancer or bile duct cancer between patients diagnosed in 1961-1980 and patients diagnosed in 1981-2008. However, in patients diagnosed in 1961-1980, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of gallbladder cancer (SIR 1.34; 95% CI 0.71-2.29) and extra-hepatic bile duct cancer (SIR 1.20; 95% CI 0.55-2.28) > 5 years of follow-up after the prostate cancer diagnosis. No such association was found for patients diagnosed in 1981-2008. Sensitivity analyses excluding prostate cancer patients exposed to potential confounding factors did not change the SIRs.  Conclusions:   Long exposure to high doses of exogenous estrogen might increase the risk of biliary tract cancer.

Through electrostatic adsorption, mPEG-CS-livin short hairpin RNA (shRNA), mPEG-CS-survivin shRNA, and mPEG-CS-(livin shRNA + survivin shRNA) nanoparticles were then prepared to transfect PC-3M cells. The mRNA and protein expression levels of livin and survivin were measured by reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The inhibitory effects of down-regulated livin and survivin gene expression on the cell proliferation were evaluated by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed visually using Hoechst staining. Livin and survivin expression levels in all shRNA interference groups were effectively down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. Dual silencing of livin and survivin genes markedly inhibited cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis, with better outcomes than those of individual shRNA treatments. mPEG-CS nanoparticle-mediated dual shRNA interference of livin and survivin genes significantly reduced the expression levels in PC-3M cells, inhibited proliferation, and promoted apoptosis.

As the major function of the HSC niche is to maintain stem cell functions, we hypothesized that the niche regulates CSC activities of DTCs. Here we show that DTCs recovered from marrow were significantly enriched for a CSC phenotype. Critically, the conversion of DTCs to CSCs is regulated by niche-derived GAS6 through the Mer/mTOR; molecules previously shown to regulate dormancy. The data demonstrate that the niche plays a significant role in maintaining tumor-initiating prostate cancer in marrow and suggests a functional relationship between CSCs and dormancy.

Metabolic changes in prostate cancer have previously been exploited for imaging, culminating in the recent US FDA approval of [11C]choline for the detection of subclinical recurrent disease after definitive local therapy. Despite this milestone, production of [11C]choline requires an on-site cyclotron, limiting the scope of medical centers at which this scan can be offered. In this pilot study, we tested whether prostate cancer could be imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using [68Ga]citrate, a radiotracer that targets iron metabolism but is produced without a cyclotron.  Procedures:   Eight patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled in this single-center feasibility study. All patients had evidence of metastatic disease by standard of care imaging [X-ray computed tomography (CT), bone scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] prior to PET with [68Ga]citrate. Patients were intravenously injected with increasing doses of [68Ga]citrate (136.9 to a maximum of 259 MBq). Uptake time was steadily increased from 1 h to approximately 3.5 h for the final 4 patients, and all patients were imaged with a PET/MRI. Qualitative and semi-quantitative (maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)) assessment of the metastatic lesions was performed and compared to the standard of care imaging.  Results:   At 1- and 2-h imaging times post injection, there were no detectable lesions with [68Ga]citrate PET. At 3- to 4-h uptake time, there were a total of 71 [68Ga]citrate-positive lesions (67 osseous, 1 liver, and 3 lymph node). Of these, 65 lesions were visible on the standard of care imaging (CT and/or bone scan). One PET-avid osseous vertebral body metastasis was not apparent on either CT or bone scan. Twenty-five lesions were not PET-avid but seen on CT and bone scan (17 bone, 6 lymph node, 1 pleural, and 1 liver). The average of the maximum SUVs for bone or soft tissue metastases for patients treated at higher doses and uptake time was statistically higher than the corresponding parameter in normal liver, muscle, and bone. Visually obvious blood pool activity was observed even 3-4 h post injection, suggesting that further optimization of the [68Ga]citrate imaging protocol is required to maximize signal-to-background ratios.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary results support that PET with [68Ga]citrate may be a novel tool for imaging prostate cancer. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal imaging protocol, the clinical significance of [68Ga]citrate uptake, and its role in therapeutic decisions.""","""['Spencer C Behr', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Youngho Seo', 'Carina M Aparici', 'Emily Chang', 'Kenneth T Gao', 'Dora H Tao', 'Eric J Small', 'Michael J Evans']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Comparison of hybrid (68)Ga-PSMA PET/MRI and (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the evaluation of lymph node and bone metastases of prostate cancer.', 'Biodistribution of (68)GaPSMA-HBED-CC in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Characterization of Uptake in Normal Organs and Tumour Lesions.', '(68)Ga-radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging of infection and inflammation.', 'Rationale for Modernising Imaging in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Elevated labile iron in castration-resistant prostate cancer is targetable with ferrous iron-activatable antiandrogen therapy.', '68Ga-Citrate PET of Healthy Men: Whole-Body Biodistribution Kinetics and Radiation Dose Estimates.', 'Ferrous iron-activatable drug conjugate achieves potent MAPK blockade in KRAS-driven tumors.', 'Manipulating the In Vivo Behaviour of 68Ga with Tris(Hydroxypyridinone) Chelators: Pretargeting and Blood Clearance.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Improvement of Low-Count 68GaCitrate and 90YMicrospheres PET Image Reconstructions Using Block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization Algorithm.']"""

After RNA amplification and RNA sequencing, differentially expressed genes in both GG3 components were identified by a 2log fold change > 1.0 and p-value < 0.05. We applied immunohistochemistry on a tissue micro-array representing 481 radical prostatectomy samples for further validation on protein level.A total of 501 genes were up-regulated and 421 down-regulated in GG3 glands embedded in GS 4 + 3 = 7 as compared to GS 3 + 3 = 6 prostate cancer.

Transwell and wound healing assays demonstrated that CAPE treatment suppressed the migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Gelatin zymography and Western blotting indicated that CAPE treatment reduced the abundance and activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Analysis using Micro-Western Array (MWA), a high-throughput antibody-based proteomics platform with 264 antibodies detecting signaling proteins involved in important pathways indicated that CAPE treatment induced receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway but suppressed abundance of β-catenin, NF-κB activity, PI3K-Akt signaling, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression or knockdown of ROR2 suppressed or enhanced cell migration of PC-3 cells, respectively. TCF-LEF promoter binding assay revealed that CAPE treatment reduced canonical Wnt signaling. Intraperitoneal injection of CAPE reduced the metastasis of PC-3 xenografts in tail vein injection nude mice model. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that CAPE treatment increased abundance of ROR2 and Wnt5a but decreased protein expression of Ki67, Frizzle 4, NF-κB p65, MMP-9, Snail, β-catenin, and phosphorylation of IκBα. Clinical evidences suggested that genes affected by CAPE treatment (CTNNB1, RELA, FZD5, DVL3, MAPK9, SNAl1, ROR2, SMAD4, NFKBIA, DUSP6, and PLCB3) correlate with the aggressiveness of PCa.

Because ERG is a transcriptional activator, we hypothesized that ERG-regulated genes contribute to PCa development. Since microRNA (miRNA) has crucial functions in cancer, we searched for miRNAs regulated by ERG in PCas. We mined published datasets based on the MSKCC Prostate Oncogene Project, in which a comprehensive analysis defined the miRNA transcriptomes in 113 PCas. We retrieved the miRNA expression datasets, and identified miRNAs differentially expressed between ERG-positive and ERG-negative samples. Out of 369 miRNAs, miR-200a, -200b, -429 and -205 are the only miRNAs significantly increased in ERG-positive tumors. Strikingly, miR-200a, -200b and -429 are transcribed as a single polycistronic transcript, suggesting they are regulated at the transcriptional level. With ChIP-qPCR and in vitro binding assay, we identified two functional ETS motifs in the miR-200b/a/429 gene promoter. Knockdown of ERG in PCa cells reduced expression of these three miRNAs. In agreement with the well-established tumor suppressor function, overexpression of the miR-200b/a/429 gene inhibited PCa cell growth and invasion. In summary, our study reveals that miR-200b/a/429 is an ERG target gene, which implicates an important role in TMPRSS2/ERG-dependent PCa development. Although induction of the tumor suppressive miR-200b subfamily by oncogenic ERG appears to be counterintuitive, it is consistent with the observation that the vast majority of primary prostate cancers are slow-growing and indolent.""","""['Zheng Zhang', 'Rainer B Lanz', 'Lijuan Xiao', 'Lei Wang', 'Sean M Hartig', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Qin Feng', 'Bin He']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The Germ Cell Gene TDRD1 as an ERG Target Gene and a Novel Prostate Cancer Biomarker.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions induce prostate tumorigenesis by modulating microRNA miR-200c.', 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNA and TMPRSS2-ERG do not mind their own business in prostate cancer cells.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', ""miR-4482 and miR-3912 aim for 3'UTR of ERG mRNA in prostate cancer."", 'The role of miR-200 family in the regulation of hallmarks of cancer.', 'The miR-200 Family of microRNAs: Fine Tuners of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Circulating Cancer Biomarkers.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

In addition, we further investigated whether DANCR is regulated by the differentiation-promoting androgen-androgen receptor (AR) pathway and found that DANCR expression is repressed by androgen-AR; furthermore, DANCR impedes the upregulation of TIMP2/3 and the suppression of invasion and migration by androgen-AR.

Material and methods:   The risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was modelled in a cohort of 3452 men aged 70 years or younger who were primarily treated with radical prostatectomy after being diagnosed between 2003 and 2006 with localized prostate cancer [clinical stage T1c-T2, Gleason score 5-10, N0/NX, M0/MX, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/ml]. The cohort was split into two: one cohort for model development (n = 3452) and one for validation (n = 1762). BCR was defined as two increasing PSA values of at least 0.2 ng/ml, initiation of secondary therapy, distant metastases or death from prostate cancer. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was applied, predictive performance was assessed using the bootstrap resampling technique to calculate the c index, and calibration of the model was evaluated by comparing predicted and observed Kaplan-Meier 1 year BCR.  Results:   The overall 5 year progression-free survival was 83% after a median follow-up time of 6.8 years in the development cohort and 7.3 years in the validation cohort. The final model included T stage, PSA level, primary and secondary Gleason grade, and number of positive and negative biopsies. The c index for discrimination between high and low risk of recurrence was 0.68.

Methods:   Adults with metastatic cancer were treated on 21-day cycles with alisertib (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg) twice daily on days 1 to 7 or days 1 to 5 and with docetaxel (75 or 60 mg/m(2) ) on day 1. The primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies. Secondary objectives included an efficacy assessment and PK analyses of docetaxel and alisertib.  Results:   Forty-one patients participated. Eight dose levels were explored with various doses of alisertib and docetaxel. The dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenic fever, neutropenia without fever, stomatitis, and urinary tract infection. The RP2D of this combination was 20 mg of alisertib twice daily on days 1 to 7 and intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 in 21-day cycles. Eight of the 28 patients (29%) who were efficacy-evaluable had objective responses. These included 1 complete response in a patient with bladder cancer, 6 partial responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, and 1 partial response in a patient with angiosarcoma. Concomitant administration of alisertib did not produce any clinically meaningful change in docetaxel PK.  Conclusions:   Alisertib at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 7 with intravenous docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 in a 21-day cycle was well tolerated, and the combination demonstrated antitumor activity.

No effective therapeutic is available for NEPC and its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have reported that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3, also called ADRBK2) promotes prostate cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that the ADT-activated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) directly targets and induces GRK3. We show GRK3 expression is higher in NEPC than in PAC cells and mouse models, and it positively correlates with the expression and activity of CREB in human prostate cancers. Notably, overexpression of GRK3 in PAC cells increased the expression of NE markers in a kinase activity dependent manner. Conversely, silencing GRK3 blocked CREB-induced NED in PAC cells, reversed NE phenotypes and inhibited proliferation of NEPC cells.

The benefit of ADT to patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with modern dose-escalated RT is unknown. This study evaluated the effectiveness of ADT on survival of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated RT.  Methods:   This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 in the National Cancer Data Base. Favorable intermediate-risk disease was defined as 1 adverse risk factor (prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL or Gleason score of 7) and clinical T1/T2 prostate cancer. All patients were treated with primary dose-escalated RT (≥75.6 Gy or RT with a brachytherapy boost). Overall survival was analyzed with propensity score adjustment and Cox multivariate modeling.  Results:   The study included 18,598 patients. The use of ADT decreased from 43.5% in 2004 to 39.5% in 2007. The propensity score-adjusted survival analysis demonstrated similar 8-year overall survival for men treated with dose-escalated RT and ADT and men treated with RT alone (77.7% vs 78.4%). ADT was not associated with improved survival in any age or comorbidity subgroup. In a sensitivity analysis using Cox multivariate modeling, the receipt of ADT was not associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.07; P = .768).  Conclusions:   Adding ADT to modern dose-escalated RT was not associated with improved survival for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The applicability of the survival benefit seen in older trials to modern patients is unclear. Because of the morbidity associated with ADT, dose-escalated RT alone for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer may be a reasonable option.

Beside these canonical pathways, the nuclear localization of the ErbB receptors in primary tumours and cancer cell lines led to investigate their role as transcriptional regulators of cancer genes. The nuclear localization of ErbB3 has been reported in various cancer tissues and cell lines but the nuclear functions and the putative correlation with tumour progression and resistance to therapy remain unclear. We first assessed ErbB3 expression in normal and tumour prostate tissues. The nuclear staining was mainly due to an isoform matching the C-terminus domain of the full length ErbB3185kDa receptor. Nuclear staining was also restricted to cancer cells and was increased in advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer when compared to localized tumours, suggesting it could be involved in the progression of prostate cancer up to the terminal castration-resistant stage. ChIP-on-chip experiments were performed on immortalized and tumour cell lines selected upon characterization of endogenous nuclear expression of an ErbB380kDa isoform. Among the 1840 target promoters identified, 26 were selected before ErbB380kDa-dependent gene expression was evaluated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, providing evidence that ErbB380kDa exerted transcriptional control on those genes. Some targets are already known to be involved in prostate cancer progression even though no link was previously established with ErbB3 membrane and/or nuclear signalling. Many others, not yet associated with prostate cancer, could provide new therapeutic possibilities for patients expressing ErbB380kDa. Detecting ErbB380kDa could thus constitute a useful marker of prognosis and response to therapy.""","""['Mahmoud El Maassarani', 'Alice Barbarin', 'Gaëlle Fromont', 'Ouafae Kaissi', 'Margot Lebbe', 'Brigitte Vannier', 'Ahmed Moussa', 'Paule Séité']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['ErbB3(80 kDa), a nuclear variant of the ErbB3 receptor, binds to the Cyclin D1 promoter to activate cell proliferation but is negatively controlled by p14ARF.', 'Expression and nuclear localization of ErbB3 in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor profiling in prostatospheroids and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An update of the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa) -induced changes in the expression and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HER-ligands (Review).', 'Personalization of prostate cancer therapy through phosphoproteomics.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptional activity is required for heregulin-1β-mediated nuclear localization of the HER3/ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'NLRC5 affects diet-induced adiposity in female mice and co-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ target genes.', 'Mechanisms of Receptor Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ErbB-3 (ERBB3) Action in Human Neoplasia.']"""

Design:   Total population-based case-control study.  Setting and subjects:   4562 cancer patients and 17,979 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care unit. Data were collected from the Swedish Cancer Register and the Regional Healthcare Database.  Method:   We identified cancer patients in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden diagnosed in 2011 with prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, gynaecological, and skin cancers including malignant melanoma. We studied the symptoms and diagnoses identified by diagnostic codes during a diagnostic interval of 12 months before the cancer diagnosis.  Main outcome measures:   Consultation frequency, symptom density by cancer type, prevalence and odds ratios (OR) for the diagnostic codes in the cancer population as a whole.  Results:   The diagnostic codes with the highest OR were unspecified lump in breast, neoplasm of uncertain behaviour, and abnormal serum enzyme levels. The codes with the highest prevalence were hyperplasia of prostate, other skin changes and abdominal and pelvic pain. The frequency of diagnostic codes and consultations in primary care rose in tandem 50 days before diagnosis for breast and gynaecological cancer, 60 days for malignant melanoma and skin cancer, 80 days for prostate cancer and 100 days for colorectal and lung cancer.  Conclusion:   Eighty-seven percent of patients with the most common cancers consulted a general practitioner (GP) a year before their diagnosis. An increase in consultation frequency and presentation of any symptom should raise the GP's suspicion of cancer. Key points Knowledge about the prevalence of early symptoms and other clinical signs in cancer patients in primary care remains insufficient. • Eighty-seven percent of the patients with the seven most common cancers consulted a general practitioner 12 months prior to cancer diagnosis. • Both the frequency of consultation and the number of symptoms and diseases expressed in diagnostic codes rose in tandem 50-100 days before the cancer diagnosis. • Unless it is caused by a previously known disease, an increased consultation rate for any symptom should result in a swift investigation or referral from primary care to confirm or exclude cancer.""","""['Marcela Ewing', 'Peter Naredi', 'Szilard Nemes', 'Chenyang Zhang', 'Jörgen Månsson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Scand J Prim Health Care""","""['Diagnostic profile characteristics of cancer patients with frequent consultations in primary care before diagnosis: a case-control study.', 'Identification of patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer in primary care: a case-control study.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Risk factors for emergency presentation with lung and colorectal cancers: a systematic review.', 'Long-term survivors of adult cancers and uptake of primary health services: a systematic review.', 'Use of health services one year before primary colorectal cancer.', 'Does changing healthcare use signal opportunities for earlier detection of cancer?

However, recent molecular studies have suggested that retrograde spread of invasive adenocarcinoma into pre-existing prostatic ducts can morphologically mimic HGPIN. Thus, previous molecular studies characterizing morphologically identified HGPIN occurring in radical prostatectomies or needle biopsies with concurrent invasive carcinoma may be partially confounded by intraductal spread of invasive tumor. To assess ERG and PTEN status in HGPIN foci likely to represent true precursor lesions in the prostate, we studied isolated HGPIN occurring without associated invasive adenocarcinoma in cystoprostatectomies performed at Johns Hopkins between 2009 and 2014. Of 344 cystoprostatectomies, 33% (115/344) contained invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma in the partially submitted prostate (10 blocks/case on average) and were excluded from the study. Of the remaining cases without sampled cancer, 32% (73/229) showed 133 separate foci of HGPIN and were immunostained for ERG and PTEN using genetically validated protocols. Of foci of HGPIN with evaluable staining, 7% (8/107) were positive for ERG. PTEN loss was not seen in any HGPIN lesion (0/88). Because these isolated HGPIN foci at cystoprostatectomy are unlikely to represent retrograde spread of invasive tumor, our study suggests that ERG rearrangement, but not PTEN loss, is present in a minority of potential neoplastic precursor lesions in the prostate.""","""['Carlos L Morais', 'Liana B Guedes', 'Jessica Hicks', 'Alexander S Baras', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Tamara L Lotan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Molecular evidence that invasive adenocarcinoma can mimic prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and intraductal carcinoma through retrograde glandular colonization.', 'Atypical Intraductal Cribriform Proliferations of the Prostate Exhibit Similar Molecular and Clinicopathologic Characteristics as Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'MAGI-2 in prostate cancer: an immunohistochemical study.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Premalignancy in Prostate Cancer: Rethinking What we Know.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'ETS-related gene (ERG) undermines genome stability in mouse prostate progenitors via Gsk3β dependent Nkx3.1 degradation.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic gene fusions in nonneoplastic precursors as evidence that bacterial infection can initiate prostate cancer.', 'Genomic and Clinicopathologic Characterization of ATM-deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

To analyze an extremely small number of cancer cells (less than hundreds of cells), an efficient system is required in order to analyze target cells with minimal sample loss. Here, we present a novel approach utilizing an advanced electroactive double-well array (EdWA) for on-chip analysis of a small number of cancer cells at the single-cell level with minimal loss of target cells. The EdWA consisted of cell-sized trap-wells for deterministic single-cell trapping using dielectrophoresis and high aspect ratio reaction-wells for confining the cell lysates extracted by lysing trapped single cells via electroporation. We demonstrated a highly efficient single-cell arraying (a cell capture efficiency of 96 ± 3%) by trapping diluted human prostate cancer cells (PC3 cells). On-chip single-cell analysis was performed by measuring the intracellular β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity after lysing the trapped single cells inside a tightly enclosed EdWA in the presence of a fluorogenic enzyme substrate. The PC3 cells showed large cell-to-cell variations in β-gal activity although they were cultured under the same conditions in a culture dish.

Single-cell analysis tools such as FACS, FISH-FC and single-cell barcode-based sequencing can investigate cellular heterogeneity; however, they have significant limitations that impede their ability to identify and transcriptionally characterize many rare cell subpopulations.  Results:   PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS) is a novel cytometry method that uses single-cell TaqMan PCR reactions performed in microfluidic droplets to identify and isolate cell subtypes with high-throughput. Here, we extend this method and demonstrate that PACS enables high-dimensional molecular profiling on TaqMan-targeted cells. Using a random priming RNA-Seq strategy, we obtained high-fidelity transcriptome measurements following PACS sorting of prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population. The sequencing data revealed prostate cancer gene expression profiles that were obscured in the unsorted populations. Single-cell expression analysis with PACS was subsequently used to confirm a number of the differentially expressed genes identified with RNA sequencing.  Conclusions:   PACS requires minimal sample processing, uses readily available TaqMan assays and can isolate cell subtypes with high sensitivity. We have now validated a method for performing next-generation sequencing on mRNA obtained from PACS isolated cells. This capability makes PACS well suited for transcriptional profiling of rare cells from complex populations to obtain maximal biological insight into cell states and behaviors.""","""['Maurizio Pellegrino', 'Adam Sciambi', 'Jamie L Yates', 'Joshua D Mast', 'Charles Silver', 'Dennis J Eastburn']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['PCR-activated cell sorting for cultivation-free enrichment and sequencing of rare microbes.', 'Single-Cell mRNA-Seq Using the Fluidigm C1 System and Integrated Fluidics Circuits.', 'Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Human T Cells.', 'Detecting Antigen-Specific T Cell Responses: From Bulk Populations to Single Cells.', 'Nx1-Seq (Well Based Single-Cell Analysis System).', 'RNA cytometry of single-cells using semi-permeable microcapsules.', 'Ranking reprogramming factors for cell differentiation.', 'Latest Contributions of Genomics to T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL).', 'Dual-layered hydrogels allow complete genome recovery with nucleic acid cytometry.', 'High-Dimensional Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Melanoma and Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

We investigated whether lower prostate cancer incidence among men with diabetes is attributable to lower detection due to prostate cancer screening patterns.  Methods:   We studied a population-based historical cohort of 1,034,074 Israeli men aged 21-90 years, without a previous history of cancer. The cohort was followed-up from 2002 to 2012, according to diabetes morbidity, for frequency of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, mean PSA values and detection of prostate cancer, after adjustment for age, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status and PSA testing.  Results:   In January 2002, 74,756 men had prevalent diabetes. During the 11 year follow-up, 765,483 (74%) remained diabetes-free and 193,835 developed diabetes. Approximately 10% more PSA screening was performed in men with than without diabetes, but the rate of PSA positivity (>4 μg/l) was 20% lower in men with diabetes. PSA values were already significantly lower in men who developed diabetes than in those who did not, 3 years before diabetes diagnosis. Reduced prostate cancer risk was observed among men with incident diabetes only for low-moderate grade tumours (Gleason score 2-6: adjusted HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.77, 0.89). No association was observed for high-grade tumours (Gleason score 7-10: HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88, 1.11).  Conclusions/interpretation:   Our findings suggest that diabetes comorbidity is a factor to be considered in prostate cancer screening strategies, and specifically in the interpretation of PSA levels. Furthermore, our demonstration of reduced incidence of low-moderate grade but not high-grade prostate cancer tumours among men with diabetes supports the possibility that low PSA levels, rather than lower tumour risk, explains the observed reduced incidence of prostate cancer in men with diabetes.

Preoperatively, multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) is often used to stage PCa. More recently, the use of mp-MRI has gained wide acceptance in fusion biopsy of the prostate. In this framework, the reported accuracy of mp-MRI has been highly variable, with data often originating from large referral centers with experienced radiologists. We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI for detecting ECE in the community.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed a prospectively maintained database of men with PCa who had undergone RP. We recorded the prevalence of ECE at RP and determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRI for detecting ECE. We assessed these values according to the D'Amico risk groups and compared the predictive value of MRI to that of the Partin tables.  Results:   The prevalence of ECE was 11.5%, 28.1%, and 47.1% in the low-, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 24.1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRI was 12.5%, 93.1%, 36.4%, and 77.0%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The reduction in the sensitivity of preoperative mp-MRI to determine ECE in the community setting is significant. Even with stratification using the D'Amico criteria and Partin tables, the performance of mp-MRI was not significantly improved. Because most cases of PCa are diagnosed and treated in the community, it is questionable whether mp-MRI is a suitable staging modality in the community.""","""['Rachel Davis', 'Amirali Salmasi', 'Christopher Koprowski', 'Sinae Kim', 'Young Suk Kwon', 'Izak Faiena', 'Neal Patel', 'Sammy E Elsamra', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in detecting extracapsular extension in intermediate and high - risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The predictive value of endorectal 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension in patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.', 'Can preoperative prostate MRI before radical prostatectomy predict extracapsular extension and the side of the index lesion?.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for local staging before salvage radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis.', 'Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Current Opinion on the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Staging Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'MRI detected extaprostatic extension (EPE) in prostate cancer: Do all T3a patients have the same outcomes?', 'Local staging of prostate cancer with multiparametric-MRI: accuracy and inter-reader agreement.']"""

However, most patients relapse after several months of therapy and a majority of patients with relapsed CRPC tumors express the AR target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA), suggesting that AR signaling is reactivated and can be targeted again to inhibit the relapsed tumors. Novel small molecules capable of inhibiting AR function may lead to urgently needed therapies for patients resistant to abiraterone, enzalutamide, and/or other previously approved antiandrogen therapies. Here, we describe a high-throughput high-content screening (HCS) campaign to identify small-molecule inhibitors of AR nuclear localization in the C4-2 CRPC cell line stably transfected with GFP-AR-GFP (2GFP-AR). The implementation of this HCS assay to screen a National Institutes of Health library of 219,055 compounds led to the discovery of 3 small molecules capable of inhibiting AR nuclear localization and function in C4-2 cells, demonstrating the feasibility of using this cell-based phenotypic assay to identify small molecules targeting the subcellular localization of AR. Furthermore, the three hit compounds provide opportunities to develop novel AR drugs with potential for therapeutic intervention in CRPC patients who have relapsed after treatment with antiandrogens, such as abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.""","""['Paul A Johnston', 'Minh M Nguyen', 'Javid A Dar', 'Junkui Ai', 'Yujuan Wang', 'Khalid Z Masoodi', 'Tongying Shun', 'Sunita Shinde', 'Daniel P Camarco', 'Yun Hua', 'Donna M Huryn', 'Gabriela Mustata Wilson', 'John S Lazo', 'Joel B Nelson', 'Peter Wipf', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Assay Drug Dev Technol""","""['Regulation and targeting of androgen receptor nuclear localization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reference compounds for characterizing cellular injury in high-content cellular morphology assays.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', '(+)-JJ-74-138 is a Novel Noncompetitive Androgen Receptor Antagonist.', 'Nuisance compounds in cellular assays.', 'Regulation and targeting of androgen receptor nuclear localization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

In the present study, AQP9 was determined in prostate cancer and adjacent cancer tissues; AQP9-siRNA was applied to silencing AQP9 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell PC3 cell line. Western blot and flow cytometry analysis were employed to detect changes in related-function of control and AQP9-siRNA groups. The results showed that AQP9 is significantly induced in cancer tissues than that in adjacent cancer tissues. Moreover, knockdown of AQP9 in PC3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cell prostate cancer cells increased inhibition rates of proliferation. In addition, knockdown of AQP9 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the Bcl-2 and with a notable increase in the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, indicated that AQP9 knockdown promoted apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. From wound healing assay and matrigel invasion, we suggested that AQP9 expression affects the motility and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, In order to explore the pathway may be involved in AQP9-mediated motility and invasion of prostate cancer cells, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was significant suppressed in AQP9 siRNA-transfected cells compared with that in control cells, suggesting that AQP9 is involved in the activation of the ERK pathway in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.""","""['Qiwei Chen', 'Liang Zhu', 'Bo Zheng', 'Jinliang Wang', 'Xishuang Song', 'Wei Zheng', 'Lina Wang', 'Deyong Yang', 'Jianbo Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Wnt-11 promotes neuroendocrine-like differentiation, survival and migration of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of HepaCAM inhibits cell viability and motility through suppressing nucleus translocation of androgen receptor and ERK signaling in prostate cancer.', 'MHY-449, a novel dihydrobenzofuro4,5-b1,8 naphthyridin-6-one derivative, induces apoptotic cell death through modulation of Akt/FoxO1 and ERK signaling in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Apoptosis, tumour invasion and prostate cancer.', 'Aquaporins and Ion Channels as Dual Targets in the Design of Novel Glioblastoma Therapeutics to Limit Invasiveness.', 'Aquaporin-mediated dysregulation of cell migration in disease states.', 'Aquaporins as Prognostic Biomarker in Prostate Cancer.', 'Aquaporins in Cancer Biology.', 'Signaling Mechanisms and Pharmacological Modulators Governing Diverse Aquaporin Functions in Human Health and Disease.']"""

It has been shown that a compound 4-nitro-7-[(1-oxidopyridin-2-yl)sulfanyl]-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NSC), bearing a nitro-benzoxadiazole (NBD) scaffold, enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and triggers downstream signaling pathways.

We showed that both the expression and activity of DNA-PKcs (catalytic subunit of DNA-PK) rapidly decreased upon exposure of cells to the compound. The decline in DNA-PKcs was associated with enhanced protein ubiquitination, indicating the activation of cellular proteasome. However, pretreatment of cells with thioglycerol abolished the action of compound NSC and restored the level of DNA-PKcs. Moreover, the decreased level of DNA-PKcs was associated with the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide by stable dimeric forms of Cu/Zn SOD1 induced by NSC.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the impact of insurance status and comorbidities is unknown.  Methods:   Data from the National Cancer Data Base were used to study nonelderly adults diagnosed with several common cancers from 2003 to 2011. Cancer treatment was defined as chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or any combination during the first course of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations between HIV status and lack of cancer treatment, and identify predictors for lack of treatment among HIV-infected patients.  Results:   A total of 10,265 HIV-infected and 2,219,232 HIV-uninfected cases were included. In multivariate analysis, HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more likely to lack cancer treatment for cancers of the head and neck (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09-2.01), upper gastrointestinal tract (aOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.04-3.37), colorectum (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.48), lung (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.19-2.76), breast (aOR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.98), cervix (aOR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.77-4.45), prostate (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.69-2.76), Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.66-2.22), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.65-2.00). Predictors of a lack of cancer treatment among HIV-infected individuals varied by tumor type (solid tumor vs lymphoma), but black race and a lack of private insurance were found to be predictors for both groups.  Conclusions:   In the United States, HIV-infected patients with cancer appear to be less likely to receive cancer treatment regardless of insurance and comorbidities. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest study of cancer treatment in HIV-infected patients with cancer in the United States and provides evidence of cancer treatment disparities even after controlling for differences with regard to insurance status and comorbidities.

Subjects and methods:   Prostatic RESOLVE DKI (0-1400 s/mm2) was prospectively performed for 12 volunteers. The optimal protocol was then performed in 108 MRI-visible PCAs to determine whether it can compete against a preferred b-value set (0-2000 s/mm(2)) regarding image quality and diagnostic effectiveness. Images were interpreted by two independent radiologists using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS). Readers' concordance and diagnostic effectiveness were tested with the Fleiss kappa and area under the ROC curve (Az) analyses.  Results:   A b value of 1400 s/mm(2) generated a larger apparent diffusion coefficient of gaussian distribution (Dapp) (1.35 ± 0.31 vs 1.30 ± 0.30 mm(2)/s; p < 0.001) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp) (1.11 ± 0.26 vs 1.00 ± 0.21; p < 0.001) in PCA than did a b value of 2000 s/mm(2). Interreader agreement using PI-RADS was relatively low when Dapp and Kapp maps were excluded from image interpretations (κ = 0.39-0.41 vs κ = 0.66-0.68 with Dapp and Kapp maps). Interreader agreement in staging PCA was relatively high (κ > 0.80) and was not influenced by reducing the b value. The power of Dapp and Kapp to differentiate PCA from normal tissue (Az = 0.97-0.98), tissue with a Gleason score less than or equal to 3 + 4 from tissue with a Gleason score greater than 3 + 4 (Az = 0.77-0.82), and PCA stage lower than pT3 from stage pT3 and higher PCA (Az = 0.70-0.75) was not significantly degraded by reducing the b value.

Chemotherapy has been reserved for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led trial E3805: ChemoHormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) showed that the addition of docetaxel to ADT prolonged overall survival compared with ADT alone in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. This finding suggests that there is an interaction between AR signaling activity and docetaxel sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and LAPC4 display markedly different sensitivity to docetaxel with AR activation, and RNA-seq analysis of these cell lines identified KDM5D (lysine-specific demethylase 5D) encoded on the Y chromosome as a potential mediator of this sensitivity. Knocking down KDM5D expression in LNCaP leads to docetaxel resistance in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. KDM5D physically interacts with AR in the nucleus, and regulates its transcriptional activity by demethylating H3K4me3 active transcriptional marks. Attenuating KDM5D expression dysregulates AR signaling, resulting in docetaxel insensitivity. KDM5D deletion was also observed in the LNCaP-derived CRPC cell line 104R2, which displayed docetaxel insensitivity with AR activation, unlike parental LNCaP. Dataset analysis from the Oncomine database revealed significantly decreased KDM5D expression in CRPC and poorer prognosis with low KDM5D expression. Taking these data together, this work indicates that KDM5D modulates the AR axis and that this is associated with altered docetaxel sensitivity.""","""['Kazumasa Komura', 'Seong Ho Jeong', 'Kunihiko Hinohara', 'Fangfang Qu', 'Xiaodong Wang', 'Masayuki Hiraki', 'Haruhito Azuma', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Christopher J Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Re: Resistance to Docetaxel in Prostate Cancer is Associated with Androgen Receptor Activation and Loss of KDM5D Expression.', 'Increased MYBL2 expression in aggressive hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interaction between docetaxel resistance and castration resistance in prostate cancer: implications of Twist1, YB-1, and androgen receptor.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Early serial circulating tumor DNA sequencing predicts the efficacy of chemohormonal therapy in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Unlocking the mystery associated with infertility and prostate cancer: an update.', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.']"""

Most of the citrus species offer large quantities of phytochemicals that have beneficial effects attributed to their chemical components. Our study was carried out to evaluate the anticancer effects of the pericarp of Iyokan ( Citrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka), locally known as yeagam in Korea, through modulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in both tumor cells and a nude mice model. The effect of supercritical extracts of yeagam peel (SEYG) on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases, STAT3-regulated gene products, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis was examined. The in vivo effect of SEYG on the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft tumors in athymic nu/nu male mice was also investigated. We found SEYG exerted substantial inhibitory effect on STAT3 activation in human prostate cancer DU145 cells as compared to other tumor cells analyzed. SEYG inhibited proliferation and downregulated the expression of various STAT3-regulated gene products such as bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1/2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9. This correlated with an increase in apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the expression of p53 and p21 proteins, the sub-G1 arrest, and caspase-3-induced PARP cleavage. When administered intraperitoneally, SEYG reduced the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft tumors through downmodulation of STAT3 activation in athymic nu/nu male mice. Overall, these results suggest that SEYG extract has the potential source of STAT3 inhibitors that may have a potential in chemoprevention of human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Chulwon Kim', 'Il Ho Lee', 'Ho Bong Hyun', 'Jong-Chan Kim', 'Rajendra Gyawali', 'Seok-Geun Lee', 'Junhee Lee', 'Sung-Hoon Kim', 'Bum Sang Shim', 'Somi K Cho', 'Kwang Seok Ahn']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Antiproliferative effects of Dangyuja (Citrus grandis Osbeck) leaves through suppression of constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells.', 'Ginkgetin inhibits the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activity.', 'The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting STAT3 in cancer and autoimmune diseases.', 'Highlighted STAT3 as a potential drug target for cancer therapy.', 'Effects of Eurya japonica extracts on human corneal epithelial cells and experimental dry eye.', 'Citrus Peel Flavonoids as Potential Cancer Prevention Agents.']"""

We investigated the survival expectations of patients who had LPC with and without their chosen treatment.  Methods:   A population-based sample of 260 men (132 black, 128 white) 75 years old or younger with newly diagnosed LPC completed a self-administered survey. How long the patients expected to live with their chosen treatment, how long they would expect to live with no treatment, and factors associated with the difference in perceived life expectancy were assessed using multivariable analysis.  Results:   Without any treatment, 33% of patients expected that they would live less than 5 years, 41% 5 to 10 years, 21% 10 to 20 years, and 5% more than 20 years. With their chosen treatment, 3% of patients expected to live less than 5 years, 9% 5 to 10 years, 33% 10 to 20 years, and 55% more than 20 years. Treatment chosen, age, general health perception, and perceived cancer seriousness predicted the differences in perceived life expectancy, while race and actual tumor risk did not. After adjustment for other covariates, men who choose surgery or radiation expected greater gain in survival than men who chose watchful waiting or active surveillance.  Conclusions:   Most patients with LPC underestimated their life expectancy without treatment and overestimated the gain in life expectancy with surgery or radiation. These unrealistic expectations may compromise patients' ability to make informed treatment decisions and may contribute to overtreatment of LPC. Primary care physicians, when included in the decision process, should focus on helping patients develop realistic expectations and choices that support their treatment goals.""","""['Jinping Xu', 'James Janisse', 'Julie J Ruterbusch', 'Joel Ager', 'Joe Liu', 'Margaret Holmes-Rovner', 'Kendra L Schwartz']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ann Fam Med""","""[""Patients' survival expectations before localized prostate cancer treatment by treatment status."", 'Choosing active surveillance versus curative treatment in a population-based survey of men with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Racial Differences in Treatment Decision-Making for Men with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: a Population-Based Study.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'An analysis of watchful waiting for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Five-year follow-up study of a population-based prospective cohort of men with low-risk prostate cancer: the treatment options in prostate cancer study (TOPCS): study protocol.', 'Determinants for choosing and adhering to active surveillance for localised prostate cancer: a nationwide population-based study.', 'askMUSIC: Leveraging a Clinical Registry to Develop a New Machine Learning Model to Inform Patients of Prostate Cancer Treatments Chosen by Similar Men.', ""Factors Influencing Men's Choice of and Adherence to Active Surveillance for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: A Mixed-method Systematic Review."", ""Racial and Ethnic Differences in Prostate Cancer Survivors' Perceived Engagement in Treatment Decision-Making.""]"""

Doxorubicin is one of the most widely used drugs for tumor treatment, able to kill cancer cells through several mechanisms. However, doxorubicin use is limited by its toxicity and cancer resistance. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies able to reduce doses and to overcome chemo-resistance are needed. A new class of glutathione-responsive cyclodextrin nanosponges (GSH-NS), is able to release anticancer drugs preferentially in cells having high GSH content. Doxorubicin-loaded GSH-NS, in the cancer cells with high GSH content, inhibited clonogenic growth, cell viability, topoisomerase II activity and induced DNA damage with higher effectiveness than free drug. Moreover, GSH-NS reduced the development of human tumor in xenograft models more than free drug.

Materials and methods:   Between September 2009 and September 2013, 225 patients with localised prostate cancer were treated with 3DCRT. Ninety-four patients with an estimated risk of lymph node involvement ≤15%, according to the Roach formula, were evaluated in this study. All patients received a total dose of 72 Gy in 36 fractions. Acute and late genitourinary toxicity were graded according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer radiation morbidity scoring scale. Characteristics such as age, smoking status, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery (PAPS), diabetes mellitus and the use of diuretics were analysed as possible predictive factors of toxicity. The median follow-up was 27 months.  Results:   Grade ≥2 acute toxicity during 3DCRT developed in 25 of 94 patients (26.5%). Predictive factors of acute genitourinary toxicity grade ≥2 in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVA) were current smoking status (P = 0.003), PAPS (P = 0.012) and the use of diuretics (P = 0.017). The 2 and 3 year cumulative risk of late genitourinary toxicity grade ≥1 was 25.3% and 30.2%, respectively. In the MVA, acute genitourinary toxicity was significantly associated with late genitourinary toxicity (P = 0.024).  Conclusion:   Current smoking status, PAPS and the use of diuretics have a significant effect on the occurrence of acute genitourinary toxicity grade ≥2.

We assessed the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-targeted transperineal fusion-biopsies in men under AS.  Methods:   In all, 149 low-risk prostate cancer (PC) patients were included in AS between 2010 and 2015. Forty-five patients were initially diagnosed by combined 24-core systematic transperineal saturation biopsy (SB) and MRI/transurethral ultrasound (TRUS)-fusion targeted lesion biopsy (TB). A total of 104 patients first underwent 12-core TRUS-biopsy. All patients were followed-up by combined SB and TB for restratification after 1 and 2 years. All mpMRI examinations were analyzed using PIRADS. AS was performed according to PRIAS-criteria and a NIH-nomogram for AS-disqualification was investigated. AS-disqualification rates for men initially diagnosed by standard or fusion biopsy were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests. Differences in detection rates of the SB and TB components were evaluated with a paired-sample analysis. Regression analyses were performed to predict AS-disqualification.  Results:   A total of, 48.1% of patients diagnosed by 12-core TRUS-biopsy were disqualified from AS based on the MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy results. In the initial fusion-biopsy cohort, upgrading occurred significantly less frequently during 2-year follow-up (20%, P<0.001). TBs alone were significantly superior compared with SBs alone to detect Gleason-score-upgrading. NPV for Gleason-upgrading was 93.5% for PIRADS⩽2. PSA level, PSA density, NIH-nomogram, initial PIRADS score (P<0.001 each) and PIRADS-progression on consecutive MRI (P=0.007) were significant predictors of AS-disqualification.  Conclusions:   Standard TRUS-biopsies lead to significant underestimation of PC under AS. MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies, and especially the TB component allow more reliable risk classification, leading to a significantly decreased chance of subsequent AS-disqualification. Cancer detection with mpMRI alone is not yet sensitive enough to omit SB on follow-up after initial 12-core TRUS-biopsy. After MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy confirmed AS, it may be appropriate to biopsy only those men with suspected progression on MRI.""","""['J P Radtke', 'T H Kuru', 'D Bonekamp', 'M T Freitag', 'M B Wolf', 'C D Alt', 'G Hatiboglu', 'S Boxler', 'S Pahernik', 'W Roth', 'M C Roethke', 'H P Schlemmer', 'M Hohenfellner', 'B A Hadaschik']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Standardized Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reporting Using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion with Transperineal Saturation Biopsy to Select Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Multiparametric MRI and MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy in patients with prior negative prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of free-hand transperineal mpMRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy with transperineal 12-core systematic biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a single-center prospective study in China.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'The current role of MRI for guiding active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Combining clinical and MRI data to manage PI-RADS 3 lesions and reduce excessive biopsy.', 'Utility of digital rectal examination in a population with prostate cancer treated with active surveillance.', 'Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy versus combined magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion and systematic biopsy for prostate cancer detection in routine clinical practice.']"""

Both may present with bone metastases, and both are known to be CK7/CK20 negative. Thus, diagnosis of less well-differentiated tumors at metastatic sites essentially relies on immunohistochemical confirmation. However, insufficient data exist on the expression status of the main 2 hepatocyte markers hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar-1) and arginase-1 (Arg-1) in prostatic adenocarcinoma. We screened 557 prostate carcinoma cases for expression of these 2 markers using tissue microarrays. Sixty-four of 557 (11.5%) cases showed highly variable expression of HepPar-1 in 1% to 75% of tumor cells with a characteristically strong granular ""mitochondrial"" pattern. Only 13 cases (2.3%) expressed HepPar-1 in greater than 10% of the tumor cells. No correlation was seen with Gleason grade. On the other hand, 19 (3.4%) of 557 cases showed variable nonspecific cytoplasmic expression of Arg-1 distinct from the specific combined nucleocytoplasmic staining seen in normal liver and in HCC. Specifically, this Arg-1 pattern was seen only using one antibody lot and not another suggesting cross-reactivity. Only a single case showed specific nucleocytoplasmic expression of Arg-1 in the tumor cells. In conclusion, specific granular cytoplasmic staining for HepPar-1 is frequent in prostatic adenocarcinomas (11.5%) but usually focal and limited to less than 5% of tumor cells. This should not be misinterpreted as evidence of HCC, particularly in solid-pattern neoplasms. On the other hand, specific Arg-1 expression is very rare (0.18%), highlighting the value of Arg-1 in distinguishing HepPar-1-positive prostatic carcinoma from HCC at metastatic sites or in cases of liver metastasis from prostate carcinoma.""","""['Johannes Giedl', 'Maike Büttner-Herold', 'Sven Wach', 'Bernd Wullich', 'Arndt Hartmann', 'Abbas Agaimy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['The diagnostic value of arginase-1 immunostaining in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from metastatic carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma as compared to HepPar-1.', 'Arginase-1, HepPar-1, and Glypican-3 are the most effective panel of markers in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from metastatic tumor on fine-needle aspiration specimens.', 'Efficacy of expressions of Arg-1, Hep Par-1, and CK19 in the diagnosis of the primary hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes and exclusion of the metastases.', 'Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the lung: report of five cases and review of the literature.', 'Immunohistochemistry as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of ovarian tumors.', 'Large-Scale Tissue Microarray Evaluation Corroborates High Specificity of High-Level Arginase-1 Immunostaining for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Pigs in a blanket: an unusual presentation of malignant ascites in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'A Rare Case of Liver Metastasis from Prostate Cancer Mimicking Hepatocellular Carcinoma on Immunohistochemistry: Role of F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Diagnosis.', 'SMARCA4-deficient pulmonary adenocarcinoma: clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics of a novel aggressive neoplasm with a consistent TTF1neg/CK7pos/HepPar-1pos immunophenotype.']"""

Predictors of outcome in this context remain undetermined. ThE objective was to assess the role of number of positive lymph node on outcome of patients with LNM after sRP and for radio-recurrent prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   We analyzed data from a consecutive cohort of 215 men treated with sRP at a single institution. We used univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastatic outcomes, with prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, time between radiation therapy and sRP, and number of positive nodes as predictors.  Results:   Of the 47 patients with LNM, 37 developed BCR, 11 developed distant metastasis and 4 died with a median follow-up of 2.3 years for survivors. The risk of metastases increased with higher pre-operative PSA levels (HR 1.19 per 1ng/ml; 95% CI: 1.06-1.34; P=.003). The remaining predictors did not reach conventional levels of significance. However, removal of 3 or more positive lymph nodes demonstrated a positive association, as expected, with metastatic disease (HR 3.44; 95% CI: 0.91-13.05; P=.069) compared to one or 2 positive nodes. Similarly, the presence of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and Gleason grade greater than 7 also demonstrated a positive association with higher risk of metástasis, with hazard ratios of 3.97 (95% CI: 0.50, 31.4; P=.2), 3.72 (95% CI: 0.80-17.26; P=.1), and 1.45 (95% CI: 0.44-4.76; P=.5), respectively.  Conclusions:   In patients with LNM after sRP for radio-recurrent prostate cancer, the risk of distant metástasis is likely to be influenced by the number of positive nodes (3 or more), high preoperative PSA, Gleason grade and advanced pathologic stage. These results are consistent with the findings of number of nodes (1 to 2 vs. 3 or more nodes positive) as a prognostic indicator after primary radical prostatectomy and strengthen the plea for a revision of the nodal staging for prostate cancer.""","""['G Gugliemetti', 'R Sukhu', 'M A Conca Baenas', 'J Meeks', 'D D Sjoberg', 'J A Eastham', 'P T Scardino', 'K Touijer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Long-term outcomes of patients with lymph node metastasis treated with radical prostatectomy without adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Lymph node yield during radical prostatectomy does not impact rate of biochemical recurrence in patients with seminal vesicle invasion and node-negative disease.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Objective:   To determine the association of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of common types of cancer and whether associations vary by body size and/or smoking.  Design, setting, and participants:   We pooled data from 12 prospective US and European cohorts with self-reported physical activity (baseline, 1987-2004). We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for associations of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of 26 types of cancer. Leisure-time physical activity levels were modeled as cohort-specific percentiles on a continuous basis and cohort-specific results were synthesized by random-effects meta-analysis. Hazard ratios for high vs low levels of activity are based on a comparison of risk at the 90th vs 10th percentiles of activity. The data analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, to June 1, 2015.  Exposures:   Leisure-time physical activity of a moderate to vigorous intensity.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incident cancer during follow-up.  Results:   A total of 1.44 million participants (median [range] age, 59 [19-98] years; 57% female) and 186 932 cancers were included. High vs low levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with lower risks of 13 cancers: esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.89), liver (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98), lung (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77), kidney (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85), gastric cardia (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), endometrial (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92), myeloid leukemia (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92), myeloma (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95), colon (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91), head and neck (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93), rectal (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95), bladder (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.92), and breast (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Body mass index adjustment modestly attenuated associations for several cancers, but 10 of 13 inverse associations remained statistically significant after this adjustment. Leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher risks of malignant melanoma (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.40) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08). Associations were generally similar between overweight/obese and normal-weight individuals. Smoking status modified the association for lung cancer but not other smoking-related cancers.

From a screen for functionally relevant ERG interactors, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. ERG recruits PRMT5 to AR-target genes, where PRMT5 methylates AR on arginine 761. This attenuates AR recruitment and transcription of genes expressed in differentiated prostate epithelium. The AR-inhibitory function of PRMT5 is restricted to TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer cells. Mutation of this methylation site on AR results in a transcriptionally hyperactive AR, suggesting that the proliferative effects of ERG and PRMT5 are mediated through attenuating AR's ability to induce genes normally involved in lineage differentiation. This provides a rationale for targeting PRMT5 in TMPRSS2:ERG positive prostate cancers.

Methods:   123 consecutive patients underwent T2 weighted, T1 weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI without endorectal coil prior to radical prostatectomy. The accuracy of predicting extracapsular extension (ECE) (T3a) was assessed using direct signs or the combination of direct and indirect signs of extraprostatic extension. The accuracy of predicting seminal vesicle invasion (T3b) was evaluated, taking into account different routes of seminal vesicle involvement. Finally, adjacent organ invasion (T4) was evaluated in this patient population.  Results:   Histopathology showed T3a, T3b and T4 in 61, 28 and 9 cases, respectively. The use of direct signs of extraprostatic extension showed a sensitivity of 57.4% and specificity of 91.9%. The combination of direct signs and indirect signs improved sensitivity (85.2%) at the expense of moderate loss of specificity (83.9%). MR sensitivity for the detection of seminal vesicle invasion was low (53.6%); however, it was dependent on the route of seminal vesicle tumour infiltration. MR sensitivity and specificity for adjacent organ invasion were 88.9% and 99.1%.  Conclusion:   Simplified MRI study at 1.5 T provides a relatively high sensitivity for detecting ECE (T3a) when using the combination of indirect and direct signs. However, this high sensitivity reading is at the cost of a moderate loss of specificity. Invasion of the seminal vesicles (T3b) occurs most often along the ejaculatory duct complex with low MR sensitivity.

Results:   Eight studies were identified with 65,695 ADT users and 91,893 non-ADT users. The pooled incidence of diabetes was 39% higher in ADT groups. A significant association was observed in the overall analysis (risk ratio [RR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.53; P < 0.001).

When the role of SCFSkp2/Cks1-mediated p27 ubiquitination in cancer was specifically tested by p27 Thr187-to-Ala knockin (p27T187A KI), it was found dispensable for KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis but essential for Rb1-deficient pituitary tumorigenesis. Here we identify pRb and p53 doubly deficient (DKO) prostate tumorigenesis as a context in which p27 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2/Cks1 is required for p27 downregulation. p27 protein accumulated in prostate when p27T187A KI mice underwent DKO prostate tumorigenesis. p27T187A KI or Skp2 knockdown (KD) induced similar degrees of p27 protein accumulation in DKO prostate cells, and Skp2 KD did not further increase p27 protein in DKO prostate cells that contained p27T187A KI (AADKO prostate cells). p27T187A KI activated an E2F1-p73-apoptosis axis in DKO prostate tumorigenesis, slowed disease progression and significantly extended survival. Querying co-occurrence relationships among RB1, TP53, PTEN, NKX3-1 and MYC in TCGA of prostate cancer identified co-inactivation of RB1 and TP53 as the only statistically significant co-occurrences in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Trichomonads have been detected in prostatic tissues from prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer. Chronic prostatic inflammation is known as a risk factor for prostate enlargement, benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, and acute urinary retention. Our aim was to investigate whether T. vaginalis could induce inflammatory responses in cells of a benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line (BPH-1). When BPH-1 cells were infected with T. vaginalis, the protein and mRNA of inflammatory cytokines, such as CXCL8, CCL2, IL-1β, and IL-6, were increased. The activities of TLR4, ROS, MAPK, JAK2/STAT3, and NF-κB were also increased, whereas inhibitors of ROS, MAPK, PI3K, NF-κB, and anti-TLR4 antibody decreased the production of the 4 cytokines although the extent of inhibition differed. However, a JAK2 inhibitor inhibited only IL-6 production. Culture supernatants of the BPH-1 cells that had been incubated with live T. vaginalis (trichomonad-conditioned medium, TCM) contained the 4 cytokines and induced the migration of human monocytes (THP-1 cells) and mast cells (HMC-1 cells). TCM conditioned by BPH-1 cells pretreated with NF-κB inhibitor showed decreased levels of cytokines and induced less migration. Therefore, it is suggested that these cytokines are involved in migration of inflammatory cells. These results suggest that T. vaginalis infection of BPH patients may cause inflammation, which may induce lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).""","""['Sang-Su Kim', 'Jung-Hyun Kim', 'Ik-Hwan Han', 'Myoung-Hee Ahn', 'Jae-Sook Ryu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Korean J Parasitol""","""['Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Proliferation of Prostate Stromal Cell Induced by Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Stimulated With Trichomonas vaginalis via Crosstalk With Mast Cell.', 'Inflammatory response of a prostate stromal cell line induced by Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Inflammatory mediators of prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis promote proliferative and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of chronic prostatic inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Efficacy of Buzhong Yiqi decoction on benign prostatic hyperplasia and its possible mechanism.', 'Infinity war: Trichomonas vaginalis and interactions with host immune response.', 'The correlation between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and reproductive system cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between trichomoniasis and prostate and bladder diseases: a population-based case-control study.']"""

Materials and methods:   120 patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled. Ninety two patients underwent RP and 28 patients EBRT exclusively. We measured serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (T), free testosterone, and estradiol at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after treatment completion.  Results:   Patients undergoing RP were younger and presented a higher prostate volume (64.3 vs. 71.1 years, p<0.0001 and 55.1 vs. 36.5 g, p<0.0001; respectively). No differences regarding serum hormonal levels were found at baseline. Luteinizing hormone and FSH levels were significantly higher in those patients treated with EBRT at three months (luteinizing hormone 8,54 vs. 4,76 U/l, FSH 22,96 vs. 8,18 U/l, p<0,0001) while T and free testosterone levels were significantly lower (T 360,3 vs. 414,83ng/dl, p 0,039; free testosterone 5,94 vs. 7,5pg/ml, p 0,018). At 12 months FSH levels remained significantly higher in patients treated with EBRT compared to patients treated with RP (21,01 vs. 8,51 U/l, p<0,001) while T levels remained significantly lower (339,89 vs. 402,39ng/dl, p 0,03).

There, cabazitaxel can overcome docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we tested the effects of cabazitaxel on glioma cells, and non-transformed cells such as neurons and astrocytes. Cabazitaxel operates highly toxic in various human glioma cells at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, primary astrocytes and neurons are not affected by this agent. Cabazitaxel disrupts cytoskeletal F-actin fibers and induces apoptotic cell death in gliomas. Moreover, cabazitaxel displayed highest efficacy in inhibiting glioma cell migration and invasion. Here we demonstrate that cabazitaxel inhibited tumor migration already at 1 nM. We also tested cabazitaxel in the ex vivo VOGiM assay. Cabazitaxel stalled glioma growth and at the same time inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we found that cabazitaxel operates as an apoptosis-inducing gliomatoxic agent with strongest effects on migration and invasive growth. Thus, our report uncovered cabazitaxel actions on gliomas and on the brain tumor microenvironment.

While most Ad gene therapy vectors are derived from species C and infect cells through coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR), CAR expression is downregulated in many cancer cells, resulting inefficient Ad-based therapeutics. Despite a limited knowledge on the expression status of many cancer cells, an increasing number of cancer gene therapy studies include fiber-modified Ad vectors redirected to the more ubiquitously expressed CD46. Since our finding from tumor microarray indicate that CD46 was overexpressed in cancers of the prostate and colon, fiber chimeric Ad5/35 vectors that have infection tropism for CD46 were employed to demonstrate its efficacy in colorectal cancers (CRC). CD46-overexpressed cells showed a significantly higher response to Ad5/35-GFP and to Ad5/35-tk/GCV. While CRC cells express variable levels of CD46, CD46 expression was positively correlated with Ad5/35-mediated GFP fluorescence and accordingly its cell killing. Injection of Ad5/35-tk/GCV caused much greater tumor-suppression in mice bearing CD46-overexpressed cancer xenograft compared to mock group. Analysis of CRC samples revealed that patients with positive CD46 expression had a higher survival rate (p=0.031), carried tumors that were well-differentiated, but less invasive and metastatic, and with a low T stage (all p<0.05).

In this paper, a fully automatic slice-based segmentation method was developed to segment TRUS prostate images. The initial prostate contour was determined using a novel method based on the radial bas-relief (RBR) method, and a false edge removal algorithm proposed here in. 2D slice-based propagation was used in which the contour on each image slice was deformed using a level-set evolution model, which was driven by edge-based and region-based energy fields generated by dyadic wavelet transform. The optimized contour on an image slice propagated to the adjacent slice, and subsequently deformed using the level-set model. The propagation continued until all image slices were segmented. To determine the initial slice where the propagation began, the initial prostate contour was deformed individually on each transverse image. A method was developed to self-assess the accuracy of the deformed contour based on the average image intensity inside and outside of the contour. The transverse image on which highest accuracy was attained was chosen to be the initial slice for the propagation process. Evaluation was performed for 336 transverse images from 15 prostates that include images acquired at mid-gland, base and apex regions of the prostates. The average mean absolute difference (MAD) between algorithm and manual segmentations was 0.79±0.26mm, which is comparable to results produced by previously published semi-automatic segmentation methods. Statistical evaluation shows that accurate segmentation was not only obtained at the mid-gland, but also at the base and apex regions.""","""['Yanyan Yu', 'Yimin Chen', 'Bernard Chiu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Three-dimensional prostate segmentation using level set with shape constraint based on rotational slices for 3D end-firing TRUS guided biopsy.', 'Fast prostate segmentation in 3D TRUS images based on continuity constraint using an autoregressive model.', 'Carotid plaque segmentation from three-dimensional ultrasound images by direct three-dimensional sparse field level-set optimization.', 'Automated breast tumor detection and segmentation with a novel computational framework of whole ultrasound images.', 'Liver segmentation with new supervised method to create initial curve for active contour.', 'Ultrasound prostate segmentation based on multidirectional deeply supervised V-Net.']"""

Patients and methods:   Incidence and mortality rates for Germany and the USA for the period 1999-2010 were obtained from the Centre for Cancer Registry Data at the Robert Koch Institute and the USA Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. For analyses on stage and survival, data from 12 population-based cancer registries in Germany and from the SEER-13 database were analysed. Patients (aged ≥ 15 years) diagnosed with prostate cancer (1997-2010) and mortality follow-up to December 2010 were included. The 5- and 10-year RS and survival trends (2002-2010) were calculated using standard and model-based period analysis.  Results:   Between 1999 and 2010, prostate cancer incidence decreased in the USA but increased in Germany. Nevertheless, incidence remained higher in the USA throughout the study period (99.8 vs 76.0 per 100,000 in 2010). The proportion of localised disease significantly increased from 51.9% (1998-2000) to 69.6% (2007-2010) in Germany and from 80.5% (1998-2000) to 82.6% (2007-2010) in the USA. Mortality slightly decreased in both countries (1999-2010). Overall, 5- and 10-year RS was lower in Germany (93.3%; 90.7%) than in the USA (99.4%; 99.6%) but comparable after adjustment for stage.

However, several molecular events, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulation, in the prostate microenvironment result in the appearance of aggressive, highly proliferative castrate-resistant NEPC. In this study, we examined the mechanistic effects of a natural prenylflavonoid, icaritin (ICT), on neuroendocrine differentiation in IL-6-induced LNCaP cells and NEPC development in the male transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. TRAMP mice received daily intraperitoneal injection of ICT or vehicle. ICT induced apoptosis in prostate tumor, suppressed NEPC development and, accordingly, improved overall survival in TRAMP mice. Expression of neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin) and androgen receptor in TRAMP mice and neuroendocrine-like LNCaP cells were inhibited by ICT. Suppression of neuroendocrine and NEPC development by ICT was associated with dose-dependent inhibitory effects on abnormally elevated IL-6/STAT3 and Aurora kinase A in vitro and in vivo Since ICT demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles with marked enrichment in prostate tissues, our study provides evidence for the development of prenylflavonoid as a multimodal therapeutic agent against NEPC.""","""['Feng Sun', 'Zhi Wei Zhang', 'Ee Min Tan', 'Z L Ryan Lim', 'Yu Li', 'Xiao Chong Wang', 'Seok Eng Chua', 'Jun Li', 'Edwin Cheung', 'Eu-Leong Yong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Repurposing of the Antiepileptic Drug Levetiracetam to Restrain Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer and Inhibit Mast Cell Support to Adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeting RET Kinase in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'A Phase II Trial of the Aurora Kinase A Inhibitor Alisertib for Patients with Castration-resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Efficacy and Biomarkers.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: novel morphological insights and future therapeutic perspectives.', 'Neural Transcription Factors in Disease Progression.', 'Androgen deprivation restores ARHGEF2 to promote neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in neuroendocrine prostate cancer research: From model construction to molecular network analyses.', 'TCF7L1 regulates cytokine response and neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'Icaritin Induces Anti-tumor Immune Responses in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Inhibiting Splenic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Generation.', 'Loss of EHF facilitates the development of treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we investigated the ability of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to promote PCA progression, and silibinin efficacy to target this response. We collected conditioned media from CAFs treated with vehicle or silibinin, and labeled as control conditioned media (CCM) or silibinin-treatment conditioned media (SBCM), respectively. Next, we characterized the effect of CCM and SBCM treatment in several PCA cell lines (RWPE-1, WPE-1 NA-22, WPE-1 NB-14 and PC3). Result showed that compared with SBCM, CCM significantly reduces E-cadherin expression and increases invasiveness and clonogenicity in PCA cells. Further molecular studies identified monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as the key component of CCM that promotes PCA invasiveness, whereas silibinin treatment strongly reduced MCP-1 expression in CAFs by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of MCP-1 transcriptional regulators-nuclear factor-kappaB and AP-1. In vivo, silibinin feeding (200mg/kg body weight) strongly reduced TRAMPC1 allografts growth (by 68%) in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice. TRAMPC1 tumor analysis showed that silibinin reduced MCP-1 and CAFs' biomarkers (fibroblast activation protein, α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta 2, vimentin etc.) and significantly modulated the recruitment of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Similar inhibitory effects of silibinin on MCP-1 and immune cells recruitment were also observed in TRAMP PCA tissues with reported silibinin efficacy. Overall, our data suggest that silibinin can target CAF-mediated invasiveness in PCA by inhibiting MCP-1 secretion.

(68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC constitutes the first (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-inhibitor and has evolved as a promising agent for imaging PSMA expression in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the whole-body distribution and radiation dosimetry of this new probe.  Methods:   Five patients with a history or high suspicion of prostate cancer were injected intravenously with a mean of 139.8 ± 13.7 MBq of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC (range 120-158 MBq). Four static skull to mid-thigh scans using a whole-body fully integrated PET/MR-system were performed 10 min, 60 min, 130 min, and 175 min after the tracer injection. Time-dependent changes of the injected activity per organ were determined. Mean organ-absorbed doses and effective doses (ED) were calculated using OLINDA/EXM.  Results:   Injection of a standard activity of 150 MBq (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC resulted in a median effective dose of 2.37 mSv (Range 1.08E-02 - 2.46E-02 mSv/MBq). The urinary bladder wall (median absorbed dose 1.64E-01 mGv/MBq; range 8.76E-02 - 2.91E-01 mGv/MBq) was the critical organ, followed by the kidneys (median absorbed dose 1.21E-01 mGv/MBq; range 7.16E-02 - 1.75E-01), spleen (median absorbed dose 4.13E-02 mGv/MBq; range 1.57E-02 - 7.32E-02 mGv/MBq) and liver (median absorbed dose 2.07E-02 mGv/MBq; range 1.80E-02 - 2.57E-02 mGv/MBq). No drug-related pharmacological effects occurred.  Conclusion:   The use of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC results in a relatively low radiation exposure, delivering organ doses that are comparable to those of other (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-inhibitors used for PET-imaging.

However, tumor cell lines fail to engage in complete senescence upon PML activation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to PML-induced senescence. Here, we report that activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 are essential and sufficient to impair senescence induced by PML expression. Disrupting CDK function by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibition restored senescence in tumor cells and diminished their tumorigenic potential in mouse xenograft models. Complete senescence correlated with an increase in autophagy, repression of E2F target genes, and an gene expression signature of blocked DNA methylation. Accordingly, treatment of tumor cells with inhibitors of DNA methylation reversed resistance to PML-induced senescence. Further, CDK inhibition with palbociclib promoted autophagy-dependent degradation of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Lastly, we found that CDK4 interacted with and phosphorylated DNMT1 in vitro, suggesting that CDK activity is required for its stabilization. Taken together, our findings highlight a potentially valuable feature of CDK4/6 inhibitors as epigenetic modulators to facilitate activation of senescence programs in tumor cells.

These populations are exposed to chronic low-level ground gas emissions and various pollutants from geothermal water. The aim was to assess whether habitation in geothermal areas and utilisation of geothermal water is associated with risk of cancer according to duration of residence.  Methods:   The cohort obtained from the census 1981 was followed to the end of 2013. Personal identifier was used in record linkage with nation-wide emigration, death, and cancer registries. The exposed population, defined by community codes, was located on young bedrock and had utilised geothermal water supply systems since 1972. Two reference populations were located by community codes on older bedrock or had not utilised geothermal water supply systems for as long a period as had the exposed population. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) non-stratified and stratified on cumulative years of residence were estimated in Cox-model.  Results:   The HR for all cancer was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12-1.30) as compared with the first reference area. The HR for pancreatic cancer was 1.93 (1.22-3.06), breast cancer, 1.48 (1.23-1.80), prostate cancer 1.47 (1.22-1.77), kidney cancer 1.46 (1.03-2.05), lymphoid and haematopoietic tissue 1.54 (1.21-1.97), non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma 2.08 (1.38-3.15) and basal cell carcinoma of the skin 1.62 (1.35-1.94). Positive dose-response relationship was observed between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, and between incidence of cancer and degree of geothermal/volcanic activity in the comparison areas.  Conclusions:   The higher cancer incidence in geothermal areas than in reference areas is consistent with previous findings. As the dose-response relationships were positive between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, it is now more urgent than before to investigate the chemical and physical content of the geothermal water and of the ambient air of the areas to detect recognized or new carcinogens.""","""['Adalbjorg Kristbjornsdottir', 'Thor Aspelund', 'Vilhjalmur Rafnsson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cancer mortality and other causes of death in users of geothermal hot water.', 'Incidence of cancer among residents of high temperature geothermal areas in Iceland: a census based study 1981 to 2010.', 'Cancer incidence among population utilizing geothermal hot water: a census-based cohort study.', 'The health of communities living in proximity of geothermal plants generating heat and electricity: A review.', 'Quantitative assessment of the environmental risks of geothermal energy: A review.', 'Cancer Incidence in Volcanic Areas: A Systematic Review.']"""

Consequently, the quality of treatment plans may not be consistent among patients, planners and institutions. Recently, different plan quality assurance (QA) models have been proposed, that could flag and guide improvement of suboptimal treatment plans. However, the performance of these models was validated using plans that were created using the conventional trail-and-error treatment planning process. Consequently, it is challenging to assess and compare quantitatively the accuracy of different treatment planning QA models. Therefore, we created a golden standard dataset of consistently planned Pareto-optimal IMRT plans for 115 prostate patients. Next, the dataset was used to assess the performance of a treatment planning QA model that uses the overlap volume histogram (OVH). 115 prostate IMRT plans were fully automatically planned using our in-house developed TPS Erasmus-iCycle. An existing OVH model was trained on the plans of 58 of the patients. Next it was applied to predict DVHs of the rectum, bladder and anus of the remaining 57 patients. The predictions were compared with the achieved values of the golden standard plans for the rectum D mean, V 65, and V 75, and D mean of the anus and the bladder. For the rectum, the prediction errors (predicted-achieved) were only -0.2 ± 0.9 Gy (mean ± 1 SD) for D mean,-1.0 ± 1.6% for V 65, and -0.4 ± 1.1% for V 75. For D mean of the anus and the bladder, the prediction error was 0.1 ± 1.6 Gy and 4.8 ± 4.1 Gy, respectively. Increasing the training cohort to 114 patients only led to minor improvements. A dataset of consistently planned Pareto-optimal prostate IMRT plans was generated. This dataset can be used to train new, and validate and compare existing treatment planning QA models, and has been made publicly available. The OVH model was highly accurate in predicting rectum and anus DVHs.

Optimization of transfection efficiency (TE) requires understanding of CL-nucleic acid nanoparticle (NP) interactions with cells, NP endosomal pathways, endosomal escape, and events leading to release of active nucleic acid from the lipid carrier. Here, we studied endosomal pathways and TE of surface-functionalized CL-DNA NPs in PC-3 prostate cancer cells displaying overexpressed integrin and neuropilin-1 receptors. The NPs contained RGD-PEG-lipid or RPARPAR-PEG-lipid, targeting integrin, and neuropilin-1 receptors, respectively, or control PEG-lipid. Fluorescence colocalization using Rab11-GFP and Lysotracker enabled simultaneous colocalization of NPs with recycling endosome (Rab11) and late endosome/lysosome (Rab7/Lysotracker) pathways at increasing mole fractions of pentavalent MVL5 (+5 e) at low (10 mol %), high (50 mol %), and very high (70 mol %) membrane charge density (σM). For these cationic NPs (lipid/DNA molar charge ratio, ρchg = 5), the influence of membrane charge density on pathway selection and transfection efficiency is similar for both peptide-PEG NPs, although, quantitatively, the effect is larger for RGD-PEG compared to RPARPAR-PEG NPs. At low σM, peptide-PEG NPs show preference for the recycling endosome over the late endosome/lysosome pathway. Increases in σM, from low to high, lead to decreases in colocalization with recycling endosomes and simultaneous increases in colocalization with the late endosome/lysosome pathway. Combining colocalization and functional TE data at low and high σM shows that higher TE correlates with a larger fraction of NPs colocalized with the late endosome/lysosome pathway while lower TE correlates with a larger fraction of NPs colocalized with the Rab11 recycling pathway. The findings lead to a hypothesis that increases in σM, leading to enhanced late endosome/lysosome pathway selection and higher TE, result from increased nonspecific electrostatic attractions between NPs and endosome luminal membranes, and conversely, enhanced recycling pathway for NPs and lower TE are due to weaker attractions. Surprisingly, at very high σM, the inverse relation between the two pathways observed at low and high σM breaks down, pointing to a more complex NP pathway behavior.""","""['Ramsey N Majzoub', 'Emily Wonder', 'Kai K Ewert', 'Venkata Ramana Kotamraju', 'Tambet Teesalu', 'Cyrus R Safinya']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Phys Chem B""","""['Fluorescence microscopy colocalization of lipid-nucleic acid nanoparticles with wildtype and mutant Rab5-GFP: A platform for investigating early endosomal events.', 'New multivalent cationic lipids reveal bell curve for transfection efficiency versus membrane charge density: lipid-DNA complexes for gene delivery.', 'Uptake and transfection efficiency of PEGylated cationic liposome-DNA complexes with and without RGD-tagging.', 'Cationic liposome-nucleic acid nanoparticle assemblies with applications in gene delivery and gene silencing.', 'Lipoplex structures and their distinct cellular pathways.', 'Pitfalls in methods to study colocalization of nanoparticles in mouse macrophage lysosomes.', 'In Cellulo and In Vivo Comparison of Cholesterol, Beta-Sitosterol and Dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine for Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation of mRNA.', 'Tumor-Targeting Cholesterol-Decorated DNA Nanoflowers for Intracellular Ratiometric Aptasensing.', 'Chemical Architecture of Block Copolymers Differentially Abrogate Cardiotoxicity and Maintain the Anticancer Efficacy of Doxorubicin.', 'Lipid-Nucleic Acid Complexes: Physicochemical Aspects and Prospects for Cancer Treatment.']"""

In this study, we investigated the expression, methylation status, and functional role of CYP1A1 on prostate cancer cells. Increased expression of CYP1A1 was observed in all cancer lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145) compared to BPH-1 (P < 0.05); and was enhanced further by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment (P < 0.01). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA of the xenobiotic response element (XRE) enhancer site XRE-1383 indicated promoter methylation as a regulator of CYP1A1 expression. In tissue, microarrays showed higher immunostaining of CYP1A1 in prostate cancer than normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; P < 0.001), and methylation analyses in clinical specimens revealed significantly lower methylation levels in cancer compared to BPH at all enhancer sites analyzed (XRE-1383, XRE-983, XRE-895; P < 0.01). Interestingly, smoking affected the XRE-1383 site where the methylation level was much lower in cancer tissues from smokers than non-smokers (P < 0.05). CYP1A1 levels are thus increased in prostate cancer and to determine the functional effect of CYP1A1 on cells, we depleted the gene in LNCaP and DU145 by siRNA. We observe that CYP1A1 knockdown decreased cell proliferation (P < 0.05) and increased apoptosis (P < 0.01) in both cell lines. We analyzed genes affected by CYP1A1 silencing and found that apoptosis-related BCL2 was significantly down-regulated.

The number of different energies requested from the accelerator can thus be reduced, which significantly reduces the treatment time. A new second generation RiFi with 2D groove shapes was developed using rapid prototyping, which optimizes the beam-modulating material and enables RiFi thicknesses of up to 6 mm. Carbon ion treatment plans were calculated using the standard 1D 3 mm thick RiFi and the new 4 and 6 mm 2D RiFis for spherical planning target volumes (PTVs) in water, eight stage I non-small cell lung cancer cases, four skull base chordoma cases and three prostate cancer cases.

Plan homogeneity and conformity of thinner RiFis were slightly superior to thicker RiFis but satisfactory results were obtained for all RiFis investigated. For the 6 mm RiFi, fine structures in the dose distribution caused by the larger energy steps were observed at the PTV edges, in particular for superficial and/or very small PTVs but performances for all RiFis increased with penetration depth due to straggling and scattering effects.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which can be easily calculated from routine complete blood counts of the peripheral blood, has been suggested to serve as a prognostic factor for some solid malignancies. In the present study, we aimed to determine the relationship between NLR in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and their prognosis. Materials and Methods. We assessed NLR in 73 men (patients) who received RP for their prostate cancer. We also performed immunohistochemistry for CD8 and CD66b in a separate set of RP specimens. Results. The median NLR in the 73 patients was 1.85. There were no significant correlations of NLR with tumor grade (p = 0.834), pathological T stage (p = 0.082), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.062), or resection margin status (p = 0.772). Based on the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) to predict biochemical recurrence after RP, potential NLR cut-off point was determined to be 2.88 or 3.88. However, both of these cut-off points did not precisely predict the prognosis. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of CD66b-positive neutrophils or CD8-positive lymphocytes between stromal tissues adjacent to cancer glands and stromal tissues away from cancer glands and between different grades or stages of tumors.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy plans mimic those of high-dose rate brachytherapy, with tight margins and inhomogeneous dose distributions. The impact of interfraction anatomical changes on the dose received by organs at risk under these conditions has not been well documented. To estimate anatomical variation during stereotactic body radiotherapy, 10 patients were identified who received a prostate boost using robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy after completing 25 fractions of pelvic radiotherapy with daily megavoltage computed tomography. Rectal and bladder volumes were delineated on each megavoltage computed tomography, and the stereotactic body radiotherapy boost plan was registered to each megavoltage computed tomography image using a point-based rigid registration with 3 fiducial markers placed in the prostate. The volume of rectum and bladder receiving 75% of the prescription dose (V75%) was measured for each megavoltage computed tomography. The rectal V75% from the daily megavoltage computed tomographies was significantly greater than the planned V75% (median increase of 0.93 cm3, P < .001), whereas the bladder V75% on megavoltage computed tomography was not significantly changed (median decrease of -0.12 cm3, P = .57). Although daily prostate rotation was significantly correlated with bladder V75% (Spearman ρ = .21, P = .023), there was no association between rotation and rectal V75% or between prostate deformation and either rectal or bladder V75%. Planning organ-at-risk volume-based replanning techniques using either a 6-mm isotropic expansion of the plan rectal contour or a 1-cm expansion from the planning target volume in the superior and posterior directions demonstrated significantly improved rectal V75% on daily megavoltage computed tomographies compared to the original stereotactic body radiotherapy plan, without compromising plan quality. Thus, despite tight margins and full translational and rotational corrections provided by robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy, we find that interfraction anatomical variations can lead to a substantial increase in delivered rectal doses during prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy. A planning organ-at-risk volume-based approach to treatment planning may help mitigate the impact of daily organ motion and reduce the risk of rectal toxicity.""","""['Michael Wahl', 'Martina Descovich', 'Erin Shugard', 'Dilini Pinnaduwage', 'Atchar Sudhyadhom', 'Albert Chang', 'Mack Roach', 'Alexander Gottschalk', 'Josephine Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Dosimetric impact of organ at risk daily variation during prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric and deformation effects of image-guided interventions during stereotactic body radiation therapy of the prostate using an endorectal balloon.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Role of the technical aspects of hypofractionated radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.', 'Dosimetric comparison of MR-guided adaptive IMRT versus 3DOF-VMAT for prostate stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy strategies in the treatment of prostate cancer patients using hypofractionated VMAT.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.']"""

In the current study, we evaluated local production of different classes of chemokines in prostate cancer lesions, and the feasibility of their modulation to promote selective entry of CTLs into prostate tumors.  Methods:   Chemokine expression in prostate cancer lesion was analyzed by TaqMan-based quantitative PCR, confocal fluorescence microscopy and ELISA. For ex vivo chemokine modulation analysis, prostate tumor explants from patients undergoing primary prostate cancer resections were cultured for 24 hr, in the absence or presence of the combination of poly-I:C, IFNα, and celecoxib (PAC). The numbers of cells producing defined chemokines in the tissues were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Chemotaxis of effector CD8(+) T cells towards the untreated and PAC-treated tumor explant supernatants were evaluated in a standard in vitro migration assays, using 24 well trans-well plates. The number of effector cells that migrated was enumerated by flow cytometry. Pearson (r) correlation was used for analyzing correlations between chemokines and immune filtrate, while paired two tailed students t-test was used for comparison between treatment groups.  Results:   Prostate tumors showed uniformly low levels of CTL/NK/Th1-recruiting chemokines (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10) but expressed high levels of chemokines implicated in the attraction of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg ): CCL2, CCL22, and CXCL12. Strong positive correlations were observed between CXCL9 and CXCL10 and local CD8 expression. Tumor expression levels of CCL2, CCL22, and CXCL12 were correlated with intratumoral expression of MDSC/Treg markers: FOXP3, CD33, and NCF2. Treatment with PAC suppressed intratumoral production of the Treg -attractant CCL22 and Treg /MDSC-attractant, CXCL12, while increasing the production of the CTL attractant, CXCL10. These changes in local chemokine production were accompanied by the reduced ability of the ex vivo-treated tumors to attract CD4(+) FOXP3(+) Treg cells, and strongly enhanced attraction of the CD8(+) Granzyme B(+) CTLs.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate that the chemokine environment in prostate cancer can be reprogrammed to selectively enhance the attraction of type-1 effector immune cells and reduce local attraction of MDSCs and Tregs .

In an effort to define novel strategies to inhibit PLCγ1-dependent signals we tested here whether a newly identified and highly specific PDK1 inhibitor, 2-O-benzyl-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (2-O-Bn-InsP5), could affect PDK1/PLCγ1 interaction and impair PLCγ1-dependent cellular functions in cancer cells.

Importantly, we report that 2-O-Bn-InsP5 inhibits cancer cell dissemination in zebrafish xenotransplants.

Reading the conventional multiplanar reconstructions was considered to be the reference standard. To simulate clinical practice, the reader was given 10 s to screen for sclerotic rib lesions in each patient applying both approaches. Afterwards, every rib was evaluated individually with both approaches without a time limit.

In addition, CRPC cells adapt to survive via AR-independent pathways to escape next generation therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for drugs that can target these signaling pathways in CRPC. In this study, we sought to determine whether carmustine and selenite in combination could induce apoptosis and inhibit growth of CRPC in-vitro and in-vivo. CRPC (22Rv1, VCaP, and PC-3) cell lines in culture and xenograft mouse were used. Combination of carmustine and selenite treatment significantly increased reactive oxygen species, apoptosis and growth inhibition in CRPC cells with down regulation of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) and proliferative proteins (c-Myc and cyclin-D1). This effect was associated with complete reduction of AR/AR-variants, AR-V7, PSA and significant induction of p27Kip1. Combination treatment substantially abolished phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3β, and anchorage-independent growth in AR-positive and AR-negative cells. Consistent with in-vitro results, combination treatment effectively induced apoptosis and completely inhibited xenograft tumor growth and markedly reduced AR/AR-variants, AR-V7, PSA, and Bcl-2 in xenograft tumors without causing genotoxicity in host mice. Individual agent treatment showed only partial effect. The combination treatment showed a significant synergistic effect. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the combination of carmustine and selenite treatment completely suppressed CRPC tumor growth by reducing AR/AR-variants and Akt signaling. Our findings suggest that the combination of carmustine and selenite could constitute a promising next-generation therapy for successful treatment of patients with CRPC.""","""['Vijayalakshmi Thamilselvan', 'Mani Menon', 'Sivagnanam Thamilselvan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Combination of Carmustine and Selenite Inhibits EGFR Mediated Growth Signaling in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Synergistic targeting of PI3K/AKT pathway and androgen receptor axis significantly delays castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vivo.', 'Combination treatment with docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulates androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of Sodium Selenite in Mice: Toxicological and Tumor Regression Studies after Striatum Implantation of Human Glioblastoma Stem Cells.', 'Akt isoforms differentially provide for chemoresistance in prostate cancer.', 'The Antitumor Activity of Sodium Selenite Alone and in Combination with Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study.', 'A Mini-Review of Reactive Oxygen Species in Urological Cancer: Correlation with NADPH Oxidases, Angiogenesis, and Apoptosis.']"""

While CLU inhibition potentiates activity of taxanes and other anti-cancer therapies in preclinical models, progression to treatment-resistant disease still occurs implicating additional compensatory survival mechanisms. Taxanes are believed to selectively target cells in mitosis, a complex mechanism controlled in part by balancing antagonistic roles of Cdc25C and Wee1 in mitosis progression. Our data indicate that CLU silencing induces a constitutive activation of Cdc25C, which delays mitotic exit and hence sensitizes cancer cells to mitotic-targeting agents such as taxanes. Unchecked Cdc25C activation leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death unless cells up-regulate protective mechanisms mediated through the cell cycle regulators Wee1 and Cdk1. In this study, we show that CLU silencing induces a constitutive activation of Cdc25C via the phosphatase PP2A leading to relief of negative feedback inhibition and activation of Wee1-Cdk1 to promote survival and limit therapeutic efficacy.

Methods:   Six out of twenty-three selected transcripts were identified as specific for detection of metastatic prostate cancer cells in peripheral blood using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Their prognostic value was explored in whole blood samples of a training cohort (n = 22 CRPC patients, New York, USA). A resulting 2-gene panel (2GP) including KLK2 and TMPRSS2 was validated in an independent cohort with pre- and post-treatment blood draws after 9-16 weeks of systemic treament (n = 86 CRPC patients, Munich, Germany). Overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical PFS were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   An unfavorable 2GP (≥1 marker positive) identified patients with poor survival (median OS 10.0 months [95%CI 5.7-14.2] vs. not reached; P = 0.023). This was validated in an independent cohort at pre-treatment (median OS 7.8 [95%CI 6.5-9.2] vs. 17.3 months [95%CI 10.7-23.8]; P = 0.004) and post-treatment blood draw (median OS 5.0 [95%CI 0.0-10.0] vs. 18.0 months [95%CI 9.5-26.6]; P = 0.003). The 2GP independently predicted OS on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 2.1 [95%CI 1.1-4.0]; P = 0.034) and performed better than PSA decline at correlation with OS. Conversion to favorable 2GP during treatment correlated with improved OS (7.8 to 20.9 months), PSA-PFS (2.8 to 12.0 months), and clinical PFS (4.6 to 8.0 months).

Increasing evidence shows that aberrant epigenetic regulation of miRNAs is a contributing factor to their altered expression in cancer. In this study, we investigate whether expression of miR-200c and miR-141 in PCa is related to the DNA methylation status of their promoter.  Methods:   PCR analysis of miR-200c and miR-141, and CpG methylation analysis of their common promoter, was performed in PCa cell-lines and in archived prostate biopsy specimens. The biological significance of miR-200c and miR-141 expression in prostate cancer cells was assessed by a series of in vitro bioassays and the effect on proposed targets DNMT3A and TET1/TET3 was investigated. The effect on promoter methylation status in cells treated with demethylating agents was also examined.  Results:   miR-200c and miR-141 are both highly elevated in LNCaP, 22RV1, and DU145 cells, but significantly reduced in PC3 cells. This correlates inversely with the methylation status of the miR-200c/miR-141 promoter, which is unmethylated in LNCaP, 22RV1, and DU145 cells, but hypermethylated in PC3. In PC3 cells, miR-200c and miR-141 expression is subsequently elevated by treatment with the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) and by knockdown of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), suggesting their expression is regulated by methylation. Expression of miR-200c and miR-141 in prostate biopsy tissue was inversely correlated with methylation in promoter CpG sites closest to the miR-200c/miR-141 loci. In vitro, over-expression of miR-200c in PC3 cells inhibited growth and clonogenic potential, as well as inducing apoptosis. Expression of the genes DNMT3A and TET1/TET3 were down-regulated by miR-200c and miR-141 respectively. Finally, treatment with the soy isoflavone genistein caused demethylation of the promoter CpG sites closest to the miR-200c/miR-141 loci resulting in increased miR-200c expression.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide evidence that miR-200c and miR-141 are under epigenetic regulation in PCa cells. We propose that profiling their expression and methylation status may have potential as a novel biomarker or focus of therapeutic intervention in the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.

Our objective is to assess whether a genetic risk score (GRS) calculated from prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can supplement FH for more effective risk stratification for PCa screening decision-making.  Methods:   A GRS was calculated based on 29 PCa risk-associated SNPs for 4,528 men of European descent in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). At study entry, participants were free of PCa diagnosis. Performance of FH and GRS were measured by observed detection rate of PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score ≥7) during the 7-year study.  Results:   GRS was a significant predictor of PCa in men with or without a positive FH (P = 1.18 × 10(-4) and P = 4.50 × 10(-16) , respectively). Using FH alone, as expected, the 17% of men who were FH+ had a PCa detection rate that was significantly higher (29.02%) than FH- men (23.43%, P = 0.001). When both FH+ or GRS >1.4 are considered, more than twice as many men (36%) can be classified as higher risk, as evidenced by a significantly higher PCa detection rate (30.98%) than in the remaining men (20.61%, P = 5.30 × 10(-15) ). If targeting only FH+ men, four out of five PCa cases would go undetected, as would a similarly large fraction (∼80%) of high-grade PCa cases. In comparison, if targeting FH+ or GRS >1.4 men, almost half of all PCa cases would be detected, including 45% of high-grade PCa cases.

Methods:   The study comprises 210 filtered sera from suspected PC, BPH, and a healthy subjects' cohort (HC). The filtered serum approach delineates to identify and quantify 52 metabolites using (1) H NMR spectroscopy. All subjects had undergone clinical evaluations (DRE, PSA, and TRUS) followed by biopsy for Gleason score, if needed. NMR-measured metabolites and clinical evaluation data were examined separately using linear multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) to probe the signature descriptors for each cohort.  Results:   DFA indicated that glycine, sarcosine, alanine, creatine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine were able to determine abnormal prostate (BPH + PC). DFA-based classification presented high precision (86.2% by NMR and 68.1% by clinical laboratory method) in discriminating HC from BPH + PC. DFA reveals that alanine, sarcosine, creatinine, glycine, and citrate were able to discriminate PC from BPH. DFA-based categorization exhibited high accuracy (88.3% by NMR and 75.2% by clinical laboratory method) to differentiate PC from BPH.  Conclusions:   (1) H NMR-based metabolic profiling of filtered-serum sample appears to be assuring, swift, and least-invasive for probing and prediction of PC and BPH with its signature metabolic profile.

To determine the proportion of patients with nodal disease confined within currently accepted target areas for extended lymph node dissection (eLND) and pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Subjects and methods:   Two radiologists reviewed WB-MRI/DWI studies in 96 consecutive newly diagnosed metastatic PCa patients; 46 patients with newly diagnosed castration naive PCa (mHNPC) and 50 patients with first appearance of metastasis during monitoring for non-metastatic castration resistant PCa (M0 to mCRPC). The distribution of metastatic deposits was assessed and the proportions of patients with oligometastatic disease and with LN metastases located within eLND and EBRT targets were determined.  Results:   Twenty-eight percent of mHNPC and 50% of mCPRC entered the metastatic disease with ≤3 sites. Bone metastases (BM) were identified in 68.8% patients; 71.7% of mHNPC and 66% mCRPC patients. Most commonly involved areas were iliac bones and lumbar spine. Enlarged lymph nodes (LN) were detected in 68.7% of patients; 69.6% of mHNPC and 68.0% of mCRPC. Most commonly involved areas were para-aortic, inter-aortico-cava, and external iliac areas. BM and LN were detected concomitantly in 41% of mHNPC and 34% of mCRPC. Visceral metastases were detected in 6.7%. Metastatic disease was confined to LN located within the accepted boundaries of eLND or pelvic EBRT target areas in only ≤25% and ≤30% of patients, respectively.  Conclusions:   Non-invasive mapping of metastatic landing sites in PCa using WB-MRI/DWI shows that 28% of the mHNPC patients, and 52% of the mCRPC can be classified as oligometastatic, thus challenging the concept of metastatic targeted therapy.

These drugs inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone resulting in apoptosis and prostate shrinkage. Most patients initially respond to 5ARIs; however, failure is common especially in inflamed prostates, and often results in surgery. This communication examines a link between activation of NF-κB and increased expression of SRD5A2 as a potential mechanism by which patients fail 5ARI therapy.  Methods:   Tissue was collected from ""Surgical"" patients, treated specifically for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to advanced BPH; and, cancer free transition zone from ""Incidental"" patients treated for low grade, localized peripheral zone prostate cancer. Clinical, molecular and histopathological profiles were analyzed. Human prostatic stromal and epithelial cell lines were genetically modified to regulate NF-κB activity, androgen receptor (AR) full length (AR-FL), and AR variant 7 (AR-V7) expression.  Results:   SRD5A2 is upregulated in advanced BPH. SRD5A2 was significantly associated with prostate volume determined by Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS), and with more severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) determined by American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS). Synthesis of androgens was seen in cells in which NF-κB was activated. AR-FL and AR-V7 expression increased SRD5A2 expression while forced activation of NF-κB increased all three SRD5A isoforms. Knockdown of SRD5A2 in the epithelial cells resulted in significant reduction in proliferation, AR target gene expression, and response to testosterone (T). In tissue recombinants, canonical NF-κB activation in prostatic epithelium elevated all three SRD5A isoforms and resulted in in vivo growth under castrated conditions.  Conclusion:   Increased BPH severity in patients correlates with SRD5A2 expression. We demonstrate that NF-κB and AR-V7 upregulate SRD5A expression providing a mechanism to explain failure of 5ARI therapy in BPH patients.

Methods:   Records of patients who underwent cystectomy and urinary diversion for the management of a devastated lower urinary tract following prostatic radiotherapy or cryotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. A postoperative, retrospective quality of life (QOL) survey was designed specific to this patient subset and obtained by telephone interview.  Results:   Extirpative surgery with urinary diversion for management of a devastated lower urinary tract was performed on 15 patients with a mean age of 72 years (range 63-82). Toxicities leading to bladder removal included bladder neck contractures, prostatic necrosis, incontinence, osteomyelitis, bladder calculi, fistulae, urethral strictures, abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis, and radiation/hemorrhagic cystitis. The mean number of failed conservative, minimally invasive interventions per patients prior to cystectomy was 3.7 (range 1-12). The average time period from major complication following radiotherapy/cryotherapy to cystectomy was 29.1 months (range 5-65). The QOL survey showed all of the patients who completed the survey (n = 13) would undergo the procedure again and 11 (85%) would have undergone the procedure an average of 13.2 months sooner (range 5-36).

However, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed no benefit of either supplement. Genetic variants involved in selenium or vitamin E metabolism or transport may underlie the complex associations of selenium and vitamin E.  Methods:   We undertook a case-cohort study of SELECT participants randomized to placebo, selenium, or vitamin E. The subcohort included 1,434 men; our primary outcome was high-grade prostate cancer (N = 278 cases, Gleason 7 or higher cancer). We used weighted Cox regression to examine the association between SNPs and high-grade prostate cancer risk. To assess effect modification, we created interaction terms between randomization arm and genotype and calculated log likelihood statistics.  Results:   We noted statistically significant (P < 0.05) interactions between selenium assignment, SNPs in CAT, SOD2, PRDX6, SOD3, and TXNRD2, and high-grade prostate cancer risk. Statistically significant SNPs that modified the association of vitamin E assignment and high-grade prostate cancer included SEC14L2, SOD1, and TTPA In the placebo arm, several SNPs, hypothesized to interact with supplement assignment and risk of high-grade prostate cancer, were also directly associated with outcome.  Conclusion:   Variants in selenium and vitamin E metabolism/transport genes may influence risk of overall and high-grade prostate cancer, and may modify an individual man's response to vitamin E or selenium supplementation with regards to these risks.

While some of the increased risk may be due to mutations in high-penetrance genes (i.e., BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, p16/CDKN2A or DNA mismatch repair genes), common genetic variants may also be involved. In a high-risk population of cases with either a family history of pancreatic cancer or early-onset pancreatic cancer (diagnosis before the age of 50 years), we examined the role of genetic variants previously associated with risk of pancreatic, breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer. We genotyped 985 cases (79 early-onset cases, 906 cases with a family history of pancreatic cancer) and 877 controls for 215,389 SNPs using the iSelect Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (iCOGS) array with custom content. Logistic regression was performed using a log-linear additive model. We replicated several previously reported pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci, including recently identified variants on 2p13.3 and 7p13 (2p13.3, rs1486134: OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.63; P = 9.29 × 10(-4); 7p13, rs17688601: OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93; P = 6.59 × 10(-3)). For the replicated loci, the magnitude of association observed in these high-risk patients was similar to that observed in studies of unselected patients. In addition to the established pancreatic cancer loci, we also found suggestive evidence of association (P < 5 × 10(-5)) to pancreatic cancer for SNPs at HDAC9 (7p21.1) and COL6A2 (21q22.3).

The transcriptional activity of steroid receptors, including AR, is dependent on interactions with the HSP90 chaperone machinery, but it is unclear whether HSP90 modulates the activity or expression of AR variants. Here, we investigated the effects of HSP90 inhibition on AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines endogenously expressing this variant. We demonstrate that AR-V7 and full-length AR (AR-FL) were depleted upon inhibition of HSP90. However, the mechanisms underlying AR-V7 depletion differed from those for AR-FL. Whereas HSP90 inhibition destabilized AR-FL and induced its proteasomal degradation, AR-V7 protein exhibited higher stability than AR-FL and did not require HSP90 chaperone activity. Instead, HSP90 inhibition resulted in the reduction of AR-V7 mRNA levels but did not affect total AR transcript levels, indicating that HSP90 inhibition disrupted AR-V7 splicing. Bioinformatic analyses of transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing data confirmed that the second-generation HSP90 inhibitor onalespib altered the splicing of at least 557 genes in prostate cancer cells, including AR. These findings indicate that the effects of HSP90 inhibition on mRNA splicing may prove beneficial in prostate cancers expressing AR-V7, supporting further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors in malignancies no longer responsive to androgen deprivation.

Precise quantification and characterization of the immune infiltrates in tumors is crucial to improve treatment efficacy. Natural killer (NK) cells, major components of the antitumor immune system, have never been isolated from prostate tumors, despite their suspected role in disease progression. Here, we examined the frequency, phenotype, and functions of NK cells infiltrating control and tumor prostate tissues. NK cell infiltrates in prostate tissues were mainly CD56 (NCAM1)-positive and displayed an unexpected immature, but activated, phenotype with low or no cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, we show that TGFβ1 (TGFB1) is highly secreted into the prostate environment and partly mediates the immunosuppressive effects on NK cells. In addition to this basal level of immunotolerance to NK cells, the prostate environment became further resistant to NK cell-mediated immunity upon cancer cell infiltration. Coculture experiments revealed that prostate cancer cells induced the expression of inhibitory receptor (ILT2/LILRB1) and downregulated the expression of activating receptors NKp46 (NCR1), NKG2D (KLRK1), and CD16 (FCGR3) by NK cells, thus preventing their recognition of tumor cells. Notably, blood levels of NKp46 were also decreased in prostate cancer patients and were inversely correlated with levels of prostate-specific antigen, the main prognostic factor in prostate cancer. Our study shows that a strong immunosuppressive environment impairs NK cell function at multiple levels in prostate cancer and provides a rationale for the design of therapies that restore NK cell efficiency in the prostate tumor microenvironment.

In seeking to understand mechanisms needed to acquire and maintain a CSC phenotype in prostate cancer, we investigated connections between the ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF, the Lin28/let-7 microRNA axis, and the CSC subpopulation in this malignancy. In normal cells, we found that ESE3/EHF bound and repressed promoters for the Lin28A and Lin28B genes while activating transcription and maturation of the let-7 microRNAs. In cancer cells, reduced expression of ESE3/EHF upregulated Lin28A and Lin28B and downregulated the let-7 microRNAs.

However, epidemiological studies in humans have demonstrated inconsistent findings linking dietary PUFAs and PCA risk. We hypothesize that genetic and epigenetic variations within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster produce gene-diet interactions that may explain these disparate findings. This study tested the relationship of the genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs174537, and the methylation status of a CpG site, cg27386326, with PUFA composition, and markers of PUFA biosynthesis in PCA tissue.  Methods:   Sixty PCA specimens from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were genotyped, pyrosequenced and quantitated for fatty acids (FAs).  Results:   Long-chain (LC)-PUFAs, such as arachidonic acid (ARA), were abundant in these specimens, with ARA accounting for 15.8% of total FAs. In addition, there was a positive association of the G allele at rs174537 with concentrations of ARA and adrenic acid and ratios of products to precursors within the n-6 PUFA pathway such that specimens from homozygous G individuals exhibited increasingly higher values as compared to specimens from heterozygous individuals and homozygous T individuals. Finally, the methylation status of cg27386326 was inversely correlated with tissue concentrations of LC-PUFAs and markers of LC-PUFA biosynthesis.  Conclusions:   These data reveal that genetic and epigenetic variations within the FADS cluster are highly associated with LC-PUFA concentrations and LC-PUFA biosynthetic capacity in PCA tissue. They also raise the potential that gene-PUFA interactions play an important role in PCA risk and severity. Prostate 76:1182-1191, 2016. © 2016 The Authors.

Even when ED treatments are effective in restoring men's ability to have an erection sufficient for intercourse, couples continue to struggle sexually. Effective treatments to help couples recover sexually are needed.  Method:   PCa patients and partners (N = 59 couples) attending a one-time couples' intimacy workshop, participated in an evaluation. The workshop, offered eight times over a 2-year period, emphasized a couples-based approach to treatment that enhances direct communication about sexuality and implementation of sexual recovery strategies that are consistent with the couple's values. Couples completed pre and post questionnaires (at baseline and 2 months later) assessing the primary outcome of relationship adjustment (Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale) and secondary outcome of sexual function (Sexual Function Questionnaire). T-tests were employed to examine pre-post changes in scores. A small qualitative sub-study was conducted on the use of a Commitment to Change goal-setting exercise, completed during the workshop.  Results:   Results provide insight into the specific nature of improvements. Patients and partners showed improvements in relationship satisfaction. Improvements with small-to-medium effect sizes were observed for patients and partners sexual function; however, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, these changes were no longer statistically significant. The specific goals set by couples, and their achievement status, are presented.  Conclusions:   The workshop offers a comprehensive, one-session intervention to help couples implement a treatment plan to promote sexual recovery after PCa treatment. Given the observed improvements, progression to a randomized control trial is warranted.

Finally, the molecular mechanisms of ACUPA-M-WOG's effects on human PSMA(+) PCa were investigated, and were mainly the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. The Western blot results suggested that ACUPA-M-WOG could enhance the WOG-induced apoptosis, which was mainly via the intrinsic signaling pathway rather than the extrinsic signaling pathway.

As a result, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies that target hypoxic cells within the tumor microenvironment. The Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases represent a prosurvival pathway that is upregulated in response to hypoxia, in a HIF-1-independent manner. We demonstrate that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PIM kinases is significantly more toxic toward cancer cells in hypoxia as compared with normoxia. Xenograft studies confirm that PIM kinase inhibitors impede tumor growth and selectively kill hypoxic tumor cells in vivo Experiments show that PIM kinases enhance the ability of tumor cells to adapt to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress by increasing the nuclear localization and activity of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which functions to increase the expression of antioxidant genes. Small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors prevent Nrf2 from accumulating in the nucleus, reducing the transcription of cytoprotective genes and leading to the build-up of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to toxic levels in hypoxic tumor cells. This toxic effect of PIM inhibitors can be successfully blocked by ROS scavengers, including N-acetyl cystine and superoxide dismutase. Thus, inhibition of PIM kinases has the potential to oppose hypoxia-mediated therapeutic resistance and induce cell death in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

For the first time we provide physical evidence for IGFBP-3:VN interactions in breast cancer patient tissues; these interactions were predominantly localized to tumor cell clusters and in stroma surrounding tumor cells. We show that disruption of IGF-I:IGFBP:VN complexes with L(27)-IGF-II inhibits IGF-I:IGFBP:VN-stimulated breast cancer cell migration and proliferation in two- and three-dimensional assay systems. Peptide arrays screened to identify regions critical for the IGFBP-3/-5:VN and IGF-II:VN interactions demonstrated IGFBP-3/-5 and IGF-II binds VN through the hemopexin-2 domain, and VN binds IGFBP-3 at residues not involved in the binding of IGF-I to IGFBP-3.

Here, we have shown that IKKβ activity is mediated by multiple kinases including IKKα in human prostate cancer cell lines that express activated IKKβ. IHC analysis (IHC) of human prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) demonstrates that phosphorylation of IKKα/β within its activation loop gradually increases in low to higher stage tumors as compared with normal tissue. The expression of cell proliferation and survival markers (Ki-67, Survivin) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (Slug, Snail), as well as cancer stem cell (CSC)-related transcription factors (Nanog, Sox2, Oct-4), also increase in parallel among the respective TMA samples analyzed. IKKβ, but not NF-κB, is found to regulate Nanog, which, in turn, modulates the levels of Oct4, Sox2, Snail, and Slug, indicating an essential role of IKKβ in regulating CSCs and EMT. The novel IKKβ inhibitor CmpdA inhibits constitutively activated IKKβ/NF-κB signaling, leading to induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, migration, and stemness in these cells. CmpdA also significantly inhibits tumor growth in xenografts without causing apparent in vivo toxicity. Furthermore, CmpdA and docetaxel act synergistically to inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer cells. These results indicate that IKKβ plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer, and targeting IKKβ, including in combination with docetaxel, may be a potentially useful strategy for treating advanced prostate cancer.

Although castration therapy is initially effective, prostate cancers progress to hormone-refractory disease and in this case taxane-based chemotherapy is widely used. Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells often develop resistance to chemotherapy agents and the search for new therapeutic strategies is necessary. In this article, we demonstrate that PKCδ silencing favors mitotic arrest after paclitaxel treatment in PC3 and LNCaP cells; however, this is associated with resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In prostate cancer cells, PKCδ seems to exert a proapoptotic role, acting as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. PKCδ silencing induces activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expression of its target genes, including Aurora kinase A, which is involved in activation of Akt and both factors play a key role in GSK3β inactivation and consequently in the stabilization of β-catenin and antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. We also show that combined treatments with paclitaxel and Wnt/β-catenin or Akt inhibitors improve the apoptotic response to paclitaxel, even in the absence of PKCδ. Finally, we observe that high Gleason score prostate tumors lose PKCδ expression and this correlates with higher activation of β-catenin, inactivation of GSK3β, and higher levels of Aurora kinase A and Mcl-1 proteins. These findings suggest that targeting Wnt/β-catenin or Akt pathways may increase the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy in advanced human prostate cancers that have lost PKCδ expression.

Objective:   To estimate the proportion of cases and deaths of carcinoma (all cancers except skin, brain, lymphatic, hematologic, and nonfatal prostate malignancies) among whites in the United States that can be potentially prevented by lifestyle modification.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective cohort study analyzes cancer and lifestyle data from the Nurses' Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and US national cancer statistics to evaluate associations between lifestyle and cancer incidence and mortality.  Exposures:   A healthy lifestyle pattern was defined as never or past smoking (pack-years <5), no or moderate alcohol drinking (≤1 drink/d for women, ≤2 drinks/d for men), BMI of at least 18.5 but lower than 27.5, and weekly aerobic physical activity of at least 75 vigorous-intensity or 150 moderate-intensity minutes. Participants meeting all 4 of these criteria made up the low-risk group; all others, the high-risk group.  Main outcomes and measures:   We calculated the population-attributable risk (PAR) by comparing incidence and mortality of total and major individual carcinomas between the low- and high-risk groups. We further assessed the PAR at the national scale by comparing the low-risk group with the US population.  Results:   A total of 89 571 women and 46 339 men from 2 cohorts were included in the study: 16 531 women and 11 731 men had a healthy lifestyle pattern (low-risk group), and the remaining 73 040 women and 34 608 men made up the high-risk group. Within the 2 cohorts, the PARs for incidence and mortality of total carcinoma were 25% and 48% in women, and 33% and 44% in men, respectively. For individual cancers, the respective PARs in women and men were 82% and 78% for lung, 29% and 20% for colon and rectum, 30% and 29% for pancreas, and 36% and 44% for bladder. Similar estimates were obtained for mortality. The PARs were 4% and 12% for breast cancer incidence and mortality, and 21% for fatal prostate cancer. Substantially higher PARs were obtained when the low-risk group was compared with the US population. For example, the PARs in women and men were 41% and 63% for incidence of total carcinoma, and 60% and 59% for colorectal cancer, respectively.

Gene expression profiles are routinely applied to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers or novel targets for cancer. However, only few predictive markers identified in silico have also been validated for clinical, functional or mechanistic relevance in disease progression. In this study, we have used a broad, bioinformatics-based approach to identify such biomarkers across a spectrum of progression stages, including normal and tumor-adjacent, premalignant, primary and late stage lesions. Bioinformatics data mining combined with clinical validation of biomarkers by sensitive, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), followed by functional evaluation of candidate genes in disease-relevant processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, motility and invasion. From 300 initial candidates, eight genes were selected for validation by several layers of data mining and filtering. For clinical validation, differential mRNA expression of selected genes was measured by qRT-PCR in 197 clinical prostate tissue samples including normal prostate, compared against histologically benign and cancerous tissues. Based on the qRT-PCR results, significantly different mRNA expression was confirmed in normal prostate versus malignant PCa samples (for all eight genes), but also in cancer-adjacent tissues, even in the absence of detectable cancer cells, thus pointing to the possibility of pronounced field effects in prostate lesions. For the validation of the functional properties of these genes, and to demonstrate their putative relevance for disease-relevant processes, siRNA knock-down studies were performed in both 2D and 3D organotypic cell culture models. Silencing of three genes (DLX1, PLA2G7 and RHOU) in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and VCaP by siRNA resulted in marked growth arrest and cytotoxicity, particularly in 3D organotypic cell culture conditions. In addition, silencing of PLA2G7, RHOU, ACSM1, LAMB1 and CACNA1D also resulted in reduced tumor cell invasion in PC3 organoid cultures.

However, the potential damage due to nontargeted heating of normal tissue is a major hurdle to its widespread application. Fullerene is a potential agent for improving cancer therapy with microwave hyperthermia but is limited by its poor solubility in water for biomedical applications. Here we report a combination therapy for enhanced cancer cell destruction by combining microwave heating with C60-PCNPs consisting of fullerene (C60) encapsulated in Pluronic F127-chitosan nanoparticles (PCNPs) with high water solubility. A cell culture dish integrated with an antenna was fabricated to generate microwave (2.7 GHz) for heating PC-3 human prostate cancer cells either with or without the C60-PCNPs. The cell viability data show that the C60-PCNPs alone have minimal cytotoxicity. The combination of microwave heating and C60-PCNPs is significantly more effective than the microwave heating alone in killing the cancer cells (7.5 versus 42.2% cell survival). Moreover, the combination of microwave heating and C60-PCNPs is significantly more destructive to the cancer cells than the combination of simple water-bath heating (with a similar thermal history to microwave heating) and C60-PCNPs (7.5 versus 32.5% survival) because the C60 in the many nanoparticles taken up by the cells can absorb the microwave energy and convert it into heat to enhance heating inside the cells under microwave irradiation. These data suggest the great potential of targeted heating via fullerene for enhanced cancer treatment by microwave hyperthermia.""","""['Mingrui Sun', 'Asimina Kiourti', 'Hai Wang', 'Shuting Zhao', 'Gang Zhao', 'Xiongbin Lu', 'John L Volakis', 'Xiaoming He']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['The influence of cell and nanoparticle properties on heating and cell death in a radiofrequency field.', 'A facile microwave synthetic route for ferrite nanoparticles with direct impact in magnetic particle hyperthermia.', 'Target visualisation and microwave hyperthermia monitoring using nanoparticle-enhanced transmission ultrasound (NETUS).', 'Development of microwave antennas for thermal therapy.', 'Micro-Nanomaterials for Tumor Microwave Hyperthermia: Design, Preparation, and Application.', 'PLGA Nanoparticles Loaded with Sorafenib Combined with Thermosensitive Hydrogel System and Microwave Hyperthermia for Multiple Sensitized Radiotherapy.', 'Craft of Co-encapsulation in Nanomedicine: A Struggle To Achieve Synergy through Reciprocity.', 'A facile and highly sensitive resonance Rayleigh scattering-energy transfer method for urea using a fullerene probe.', 'Lanthanide europium MOF nanocomposite as the theranostic nanoplatform for microwave thermo-chemotherapy and fluorescence imaging.', 'Nanomaterials responding to microwaves: an emerging field for imaging and therapy.']"""

Cell viability, proliferation and migration of ovarian carcinoma (SKOV-3) and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) were examined following treatment with bupivacaine. Cleaved caspase 3, 8 and 9, and GSK-3β, pGSK-3β(tyr216) and pGSK-3β(ser9) expression were assessed by immunofluorescence. FAS ligand neutralization, caspase and GSK-3 inhibitors and GSK-3β siRNA were applied to further explore underlying mechanisms. Clinically relevant concentrations of bupivacaine reduced cell viability and inhibited cellular proliferation and migration in both cell lines. Caspase 8 and 9 inhibition generated partial cell death reversal in SKOV-3, whilst only caspase 9 was effective in PC-3. Bupivacaine increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β(Tyr216) in SKOV-3 but without measurable effect in PC3. GSK-3β inhibition and siRNA gene knockdown decreased bupivacaine induced cell death in SKOV-3 but not in PC3.

Materials and methods:   Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed on androgen deprivation therapy received 160 mg/d oral enzalutamide or placebo (1:1) until death or discontinuation due to radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent therapy. Coprimary end points were centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included investigator-assessed rPFS, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, PSA response (≥50% decline), and time to skeletal-related event.  Results:   Of 1,717 total patients, 78 patients were enrolled in Korea (enzalutamide, n=40; placebo, n=38).

Using a novel network-based integrative approach, here, we show distinct alterations in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to be critical for CRPC. Expression of HBP enzyme glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1) is found to be significantly decreased in CRPC compared with localized prostate cancer (PCa). Genetic loss-of-function of GNPNAT1 in CRPC-like cells increases proliferation and aggressiveness, in vitro and in vivo. This is mediated by either activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in cells expressing full-length androgen receptor (AR) or by specific protein 1 (SP1)-regulated expression of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in cells containing AR-V7 variant. Strikingly, addition of the HBP metabolite UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to CRPC-like cells significantly decreases cell proliferation, both in-vitro and in animal studies, while also demonstrates additive efficacy when combined with enzalutamide in-vitro.

Mutation status, sex, age and histories of cancer from their 1,903 first- and 3,255 second-degree relatives were analyzed using modified segregation analysis conditioned on the ascertainment criteria. Compared with incidences for the general population, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: urinary bladder cancer 19 (3.7-97) and ovarian cancer 17 (2.4-115).

Relative to c-DTI acquisitions, z-DTI FA maps showed significantly reduced artifact (p = 0.008) and reduced anatomic distortion of the prostate (p = 0.010), while z-DTI tractography showed significantly better overall visual quality (p = 0.011), tract symmetry (p = 0.010), tract coherence (p = 0.011), and subjective similarity to the actual NVB (p = 0.011).

According to Gleason scale and age at diagnosis, cases were classified as high (⩾7) and low grade (<7), as well as early onset (<60 years) or late onset PC (⩾60 years). At diagnosis, 78% of cases were classified as high-grade and 26.6% as early onset. Men with sporadic (no family history of PC) and early-onset PC presented shorter CAG repeat length than controls (18.6±2.2 vs 19.5±2.5; P=0.02). Lower number of CAG repeats (CAG)⩽19 were associated with a greater risk for early-onset PC (odds ratio: 2.31; 95% confidence interval: 1.14-4.69). CAG repeat length could increase the risk for sporadic and early-onset PC. The best cutoff point for identifying at-risk subjects was (CAG)19.

Here we have demonstrated that ARF1 expression is significantly elevated in prostate cancer cells and human tissues and that the expression levels of ARF1 correlate with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2. Furthermore, we have shown that overexpression and knockdown of ARF1 produce opposing effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and that ARF1-mediated cell proliferation can be abolished by the Raf1 inhibitor GW5074 and the MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059. Moreover, inhibition of ARF1 activation achieved by mutating Thr48 abolishes ARF1's abilities to activate the ERK1/2 and to promote cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that the aberrant MAPK signaling in prostate cancer is, at least in part, under the control of ARF1 and that, similar to Ras, ARF1 is a critical regulator in prostate cancer progression.

Ectopic expression of KIBRA enhances cell proliferation, migration and invasion in both immortalized and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Accordingly, knockdown of KIBRA reduces migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth in LNCaP-C4-2/C81 cells. Moreover, KIBRA expression is induced by androgen signaling and KIBRA is partially required for androgen receptor signaling activation in prostate cancer cells.

The authors report the long-term outcome of a phase 3 study of DE-EBRT with or without HT for patients with localized prostate cancer (LPC).  Methods:   From 1999 to 2006, 252 of an intended 338 patients with LPC were randomized to receive DE-EBRT with or without 5 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent bicalutamide 150 mg once daily. The study was closed early because of contemporary concerns surrounding bicalutamide. The primary outcome was biochemical failure (BF) incidence, and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and quality of life. The BF and OS rates were estimated using the cumulative incidence function and Kaplan-Meier methods and were compared using the Gray test and the log-rank test.  Results:   Eleven patients were excluded from analysis. Characteristics were well balanced in each treatment arm. Ninety-five percent of patients had IRPC. The prescribed dose increased from 75.6 grays (Gy) in 42 fractions to 78 Gy in 39 fractions over the period. At a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 98 BFs occurred, with no significant effect of HT versus no HT on the BF rate (40% vs 47%; P = .32), the OS rate (82% vs 86%; P = .37), the LC rate (52% vs 48 %; P = .32) or quality of life, in the patients who completed the questionnaires. Dose escalation to 75.6 Gy versus >75.6 Gy reduced the BF rate by 26% (P = .004).  Conclusions:   For patients who predominantly have IRPC, the addition of HT to DE-EBRT did not significantly affect BF, OS, or LC. Bicalutamide appeared to be well tolerated.

Surprisingly, this death occurs primarily through necroptosis, not apoptosis, due to assembly of the necrosome in association with the autophagy machinery, mediated by p62/SQSTM1 recruitment of RIPK1.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between hospital ACO participation and the outcomes of major surgical oncology procedures.  Methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years who were undergoing a major surgical resection for colorectal, bladder, esophageal, kidney, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, or prostate cancer from 2011 through 2013. A difference-in-differences analysis was implemented to compare the postimplementation period (January 2013 through December 2013) with the baseline period (January 2011 through December 2012) to assess the impact of hospital ACO participation on 30-day mortality, complications, readmissions, and length of stay (LOS).  Results:   Among 384,519 patients undergoing major cancer surgery at 106 ACO hospitals and 2561 control hospitals, this study found a 30-day mortality rate of 3.4%, a readmission rate of 12.5%, a complication rate of 43.8%, and a prolonged LOS rate of 10.0% in control hospitals and similar rates in ACO hospitals. Secular trends were noted, with reductions in perioperative adverse events in control hospitals between the baseline and postimplementation periods: mortality (percentage-point reduction, 0.1%; P = .19), readmissions (percentage-point reduction, 0.4%; P = .001), complications (percentage-point reduction, 1.0%; P < .001), and prolonged LOS (percentage-point reduction, 1.1%; P < .001). After accounting for these secular trends, this study identified no significant effect of hospital participation in an ACO on the frequency of perioperative outcomes (difference-in-differences estimator P values, .24-.72).  Conclusions:   Early hospital participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO program was not associated with greater reductions in adverse perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing major cancer surgery in comparison with control hospitals.

We have developed a facile approach to functionalize CM-NPs by chemically modifying live cell membranes prior to CM-NP fabrication using a bifunctional linker, succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-polyethyleneglycol] ester (NHS-PEG-Maleimide). This method is particularly suitable to conjugate large bioactive molecules such as proteins on cell membranes as it establishes a strong anchorage and enable the control of linker length, a critical parameter for maximizing the function of anchored proteins. As a proof of concept, we show the conjugation of human recombinant hyaluronidase, PH20 (rHuPH20) on red blood cell (RBC) membranes and demonstrate that long linker (MW: 3400) is superior to short linker (MW: 425) for maintaining enzyme activity, while minimizing the changes to cell membranes. When the modified membranes were fabricated into RBC membrane-coated nanoparticles (RBCM-NPs), the conjugated rHuPH20 can assist NP diffusion more efficiently than free rHuPH20 in matrix-mimicking gels and the pericellular hyaluronic acid matrix of PC3 prostate cancer cells. After quenching the unreacted chemical groups with polyethylene glycol, we demonstrated that the rHuPH20 modification does not reduce the ultra-long blood circulation time of RBCM-NPs. Therefore, this surface engineering approach provides a platform to functionlize CM-NPs without sacrificing the natural function of cell membranes.""","""['Hao Zhou', 'Zhiyuan Fan', 'Pelin K Lemons', 'Hao Cheng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Hyaluronidase Embedded in Nanocarrier PEG Shell for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Highly Efficient Antitumor Efficacy.', 'Red blood cell membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles: a novel drug delivery system for antitumor application.', 'Erythrocyte Membrane-Wrapped pH Sensitive Polymeric Nanoparticles for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Therapy.', 'Smart surface coating of drug nanoparticles with cross-linkable polyethylene glycol for bio-responsive and highly efficient drug delivery.', 'ENHANZE® drug delivery technology: a novel approach to subcutaneous administration using recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20.', 'Recent Advances in Cell Membrane Coated-Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Systems for Tackling Urological Diseases.', 'Strategies for targeted gene delivery using lipid nanoparticles and cell-derived nanovesicles.', 'Stem cell-based drug delivery strategy for skin regeneration and wound healing: potential clinical applications.', 'Biomimetic nanotherapeutics for targeted drug delivery to glioblastoma multiforme.', ""Cell Membrane Biomimetic Nanoparticles with Potential in Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.""]"""

Brb not only augments the efficacy of antineoplastic chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also exhibits direct antimitotic and proapoptotic actions, along with distinct antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities in a variety of tumors. Despite its low systemic toxicity, several pharmaceutical challenges limit the application of Brb in cancer therapy (ie, extremely low solubility and permeability, very poor pharmacokinetics (PKs), and oral bioavailability). Among lipid-based nanocarriers investigated recently for Brb, stealth amphiphilic micelles of polymeric phospholipid conjugates were studied here as a promising strategy to improve Brb delivery to tumors.

Our PEG-PE/TPGS-mixed micelles firmly retained the incorporated Brb, displaying extended-release profile in simulated media, with up to 30-fold projected improvement in simulated PKs of Brb. Owing to the markedly better uptake of Brb-containing mixed micelles in vitro, our Brb-mixed micelles nanoformulation significantly amplified apoptosis and overall cytotoxic effectiveness against monolayer and spheroid cultures of human prostate carcinomas (16- to 18-fold lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration values in PC3 and LNPaC, respectively), compared to free Brb.

Methods:   Subject classification by characteristic glaucomatous optic nerve findings and corresponding visual field defects, as defined by enrolling glaucoma specialists, stereo disc photography, phlebotomy, extraction of total DNA from peripheral blood or saliva, DNA quantification and normalization, PCR amplification of whole mitochondrial genomes, Ion Torrent deep semiconductor DNA sequencing on DNA pools (""Pool-seq""), Sanger sequencing of 3,479 individual mitochondrial DNAs, and bioinformatic analysis.  Results:   The distribution of common African haplogroups within the POAAGG study population was broadly similar to prior surveys of African Americans. However, the POAG case population was found to be enriched in L1c2 haplogroups, which are defined in part by missense mutations m.6150G>A (Val83Ile, odds ratio [OR] 1.8, p=0.01), m.6253C>T (Met117Thr, rs200165736, OR 1.6, p=0.04), and m.6480G>A (Val193Ile, rs199476128, OR 4.6, p=0.04) in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (MT-CO1) gene and by a variant, m.2220A>G (OR 2.0, p=0.01), in MT-RNR2, which encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal 16s RNA gene. L2 haplogroups were predicted to be overrepresented in the POAG case population by Pool-seq, and the difference was confirmed to be significant with Sanger sequencing, that targeted the L2-associated variants m.2416T>C (rs28358580, OR 1.2, p=0.02) and m.2332C>T (OR 1.2, p=.02) in MT-RNR2. Another variant within MT-RNR2, m.3010G>A (rs3928306), previously implicated in sensitivity to the optic neuropathy-associated antibiotic linezolid, and arising on D4 and J1 lineages, associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) severity, was confirmed to be common (>5%) but was not significantly enriched in the POAG cases. Two variants linked to the composition of the gut microbiome, m.15784T>C (rs527236194, haplogroup L2a1) and m.16390G>A (rs41378955, L2 haplogroups), were also enriched in the case DNA pools.  Conclusions:   These results implicate African mtDNA haplogroups L1c2, L1c2b, and L2 as risk factors for POAG. Approximately one in four African Americans have these mitochondrial ancestries, which may contribute to their elevated glaucoma risk. These haplogroups are defined in part by ancestral variants in the MT-RNR2 and/or MT-CO1 genes, several of which have prior disease associations, such as MT-CO1 missense variants that have been implicated in prostate cancer.""","""['David W Collins', 'Harini V Gudiseva', 'Benjamin Trachtman', 'Anita S Bowman', 'Anna Sagaser', 'Prithvi Sankar', 'Eydie Miller-Ellis', 'Amanda Lehman', 'Victoria Addis', ""Joan M O'Brien""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Vis""","""['The MT-CO1 V83I Polymorphism is a Risk Factor for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in African American Men.', 'The association of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with POAG in African Americans.', 'Mitochondrial sequence variation in African-American primary open-angle glaucoma patients.', 'DNA diagnosis in the age of individual made-to-order medications.', 'Molecular genetics of primary open-angle glaucoma.', 'Mitochondrial Genome Alterations, Cytochrome C Oxidase Activity, and Oxidative Stress: Implications in Primary Open-angle Glaucoma.', 'Microbiome Dysbiosis: A Pathological Mechanism at the Intersection of Obesity and Glaucoma.', 'Oral administration of a dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist promotes neuroprotection in\xa0a\xa0rodent model of glaucoma.', 'Trabecular Meshwork Mitochondrial Function and Oxidative Stress: Clues to Racial Disparities of Glaucoma.', 'Differential Epigenetic Status and Responses to Stressors between Retinal Cybrids Cells with African versus European Mitochondrial DNA: Insights into Disease Susceptibilities.']"""

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the microbiological profile and data related to patients and infections, and to search for β -lactamase genes in bacterial isolates from hospitalized cancer patients in a hospital in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. A total of 169 isolates were recovered between 2012 and 2014, of which 58 were P. aeruginosa, 36 were Acinetobacter spp. and 75 were Klebsiella spp. A high percentage of carbapenem resistance was observed in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Among the carbapenem-resistant bacteria, the blaSPM-1 gene was detected in P. aeruginosa (35.5 %) and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8 %), while blaKPC was detected in P. aeruginosa (25.8 %) only. Among the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains, in Klebsiella spp. we detected the genes blaTEM (30.6 %), blaCTX-M (58.3 %) and blaKPC (5.6 %), and in Acinetobacter spp. only blaTEM (25.9 %).

In addition, annual changes of case loads for prostatectomy over 4 years from 2010 to 2013 were clearly determined in these areas. The case loads were determined based on the results of a questionnaire survey for the hospitals with robots and on the Diagnostic Procedures Combination data provided by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Wealth for those without such equipment. The concentration of the case loads was principally defined as when hospitals with robots had more predominant proportion of cases than those without them in the comparison between case loads prior to instillation of robots (or in the initial year of the study) and those in the final years. The 11 selected areas included 44 hospitals with robots and 156 without them. Concentration of case loads was found in 5 areas. In 4 areas, installation of robots did not have a specific relation to the distribution pattern s of case loads in hospitals with or without the equipment. The remaining 2 areas tended to have a weak but not definite concentration of case loads. In the areas in which installation did not influence case loads the further analysis revealed that their case loads had already been concentrated in the initial year (2010) of the study. Although the current results were found in a single department of the hospital, robotic installation may result in concentration of prostatectomy case loads for such hospitals in some areas. The current results are intriguing when we consider the future roles of acute care hospitals and beds in our country where the number of aged patients having chronic diseases will increase.

In a recent clinical trial (NCT00715104), we found that neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T increased the number of activated T cells within the tumor microenvironment. The current analysis examined whether sipuleucel-T altered adaptive T-cell responses by expanding pre-existing T cells or by recruiting new T cells to prostate tissue. Next-generation sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes from blood or prostate tissue was used to quantitate and track T-cell clonotypes in these treated subjects with prostate cancer. At baseline, there was a significantly greater diversity of circulating TCR sequences in subjects with prostate cancer compared with healthy donors. Among healthy donors, circulating TCR sequence diversity remained unchanged over the same time interval. In contrast, sipuleucel-T treatment reduced circulating TCR sequence diversity versus baseline as measured by the Shannon index. Interestingly, sipuleucel-T treatment resulted in greater TCR sequence diversity in resected prostate tissue in sipuleucel-T-treated subjects versus tissue of nonsipuleucel-T-treated subjects with prostate cancer. Furthermore, sipuleucel-T increased TCR sequence commonality between blood and resected prostate tissue in treated versus untreated subjects with prostate cancer. The broadening of the TCR repertoire within the prostate tissue supports the hypothesis that sipuleucel-T treatment facilitates the recruitment of T cells into the prostate. Our results highlight the importance of assessing T-cell response to immunotherapy both in the periphery and in tumor tissue.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) alters the epigenetic status of tumor-associated genes, including those for miRNAs (miRNA), and affects the behavior of cancers. Here, we examined the molecular effects of a HDAC inhibitor, OBP-801, on AR expression and tumor cell growth in prostate cancers. Treatment with OBP-801 efficiently suppressed cell growth of three prostate cancer lines (22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP), together with AR downregulation, regardless of their hormone sensitivity. Intriguingly, this effect by OBP-801 was not due to decreased transcriptional activity of the AR gene, but due to posttranscriptional regulation, namely by miRNA-mediated suppression. Among the upregulated miRNAs after OBP-801 treatment in the three prostate cancer cell lines, miR-320a, whose expression was significantly correlated with prognosis of prostate cancers (P = 0.0185), was the most closely associated with AR expression. An miR-320a mimic suppressed AR protein expression together with growth suppression, while anti-miR-320a oligonucleotide significantly abrogated the growth suppression by OBP-801 treatment. FISH analysis revealed that miR-320a was highly expressed in human normal prostate luminal cells, but was rarely expressed in prostate cancer cells. In an AR-dependent prostate tumorigenic rat model, OBP-801 treatment profoundly increased miR-320a expression and repressed prostate tumorigenesis. Our data demonstrated that OBP-801 effectively suppressed AR activity via epigenetic upregulation of miR-320a, which resulted in tumor cell growth suppression of prostate cancers. OBP-801 may be a potent AR-targeting therapeutic reagent in AR-positive prostate cancer regardless of androgen dependency.

The prognostic impact of this has been demonstrated in regards only to biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) with short follow-up (3 years).  Methods:   Between 1990 and 2013, 847 consecutive men were treated with definitive external beam radiation therapy at a single academic center. To validate the new grade grouping system, bRFS, distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) were calculated. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the independent impact of the new grade grouping system. Discriminatory analyses were performed to compare the commonly used three-tier Gleason score system (6, 7 and 8-10) to the new system.  Results:   The median follow-up of our cohort was 88 months. The 5-grade groups independently validated differing risks of bRFS (group 1 as reference; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.35, 2.16, 1.79 and 3.84 for groups 2-5, respectively). Furthermore, a clear stratification was demonstrated for DMFS (aHR 2.03, 3.18, 3.62 and 13.77 for groups 2-5, respectively) and PCSS (aHR 3.00, 5.32, 6.02 and 39.02 for groups 2-5, respectively). The 5-grade group system had improved prognostic discrimination for all end points compared with the commonly used three-tiered system (that is, Gleason score 6, 7 and 8-10).  Conclusions:   In a large independent radiotherapy cohort with long-term follow-up, we have validated the bRFS benefit of the proposed five-tier grade grouping system. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the system is highly prognostic for DMFS and PCSS. Grade group 5 had markedly worse outcomes for all end points, and future work is necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.""","""['D E Spratt', 'W C Jackson', 'A Abugharib', 'S A Tomlins', 'R T Dess', 'P D Soni', 'J Y Lee', 'S G Zhao', 'A I Cole', 'Z S Zumsteg', 'H Sandler', 'D Hamstra', 'J W Hearn', 'G Palapattu', 'R Mehra', 'T M Morgan', 'F Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Independent surgical validation of the new prostate cancer grade-grouping system.', 'Prognostic importance of Gleason 7 disease among patients treated with external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer: results of a detailed biopsy core analysis.', 'Prognostic value of the new Grade Groups in Prostate Cancer: a multi-institutional European validation study.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Prostate cancer: from Gleason scoring to prognostic grade grouping.', 'Histopathological Study of the Prostate Cancer Growth Patterns in Relation with the Grading Systems.', 'Prognostic Utility of the Gleason Grading System Revisions and Histopathological Factors Beyond Gleason Grade.', 'Impact of Grade Groups on Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality: Competing Risk Analysis from a Large Single Institution Series.', 'The 2014 ISUP grade group system: the Holy Grail or yet another hype?', 'Quantification of the individual risk of each Gleason pattern, including tertiary Gleason pattern 5, after radical prostatectomy: development of the modified Gleason grade grouping (mGGG) model.']"""

Also, this is the most common malignancy and the sixth most important cause of death in men worldwide. The most routine diagnostic test for prostate cancer is PSA test which is associated with some limitations like too many false positive results. This study intends to investigate the role of MMP9 and PIWIL2 expression levels as different biomarkers in prostate cancer biopsy specimens. This study is one of the most brilliant studies in the field of prostate cancer research for the first time focusing on the investigation of the role of two different genes in prostate cancer in biopsy specimens and on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue types in order to detect the progression and prognosis of prostate cancer patients in early stages.  Methods:   Seventy formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples (35 normal and 35 cancerous cases) were selected. Expression levels of PIWIL2 and MMP9 genes were evaluated, using real-time PCR.  Results:   MMP9 and PIWIL2 expression levels in cancerous tissues were significantly higher than the adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.05). The survival analysis showed a significant correlation between expression level of PIWIL2 and survival rate (p < 0.05), but such correlation was not observed in case of MMP9 (p > 0.05). Higher levels of MMP9 and PIWIL2 expression were strongly related to the Gleason score and age, using Pearson's correlation co- efficient test; however, this kind of association was not evident between prostate specific antigen (PSA) and expression levels of the genes of interest. The expression level of PIWIL2 had a significant correlation with metastasis rate, but this relationship was not seen in the case of MMP9.

Nitric oxide (NO) is regulated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme which is one of the isoenzymes of NO synthase (NOS). In this study we have tried to come to a conclusion about whether eNOS gene T -786C, G894T and Intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) polymorphisms might be considered as a risk factor causing prostate cancer (PCa) or not. A total of 200 subjects were included in this research. 84 patients with PCa (mean age 70.0 ± 6.4) and 116 healthy controls (mean age 69.9 ± 7.5) were recruited in this case-control study. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Maryland, USA), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The T-786C, G894T and Intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) polymorphisms were amplified using polymerase chain reation (PCR), detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).

A metabolic co-regulator data mining analysis unveiled that PGC1α is downregulated in prostate cancer and associated with disease progression. Using genetically engineered mouse models and xenografts, we demonstrated that PGC1α opposes prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, the use of integrative metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed that PGC1α activates an oestrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα)-dependent transcriptional program to elicit a catabolic state and metastasis suppression.

Cish was rapidly induced in response to IL-15, and deletion of Cish rendered NK cells hypersensitive to IL-15, as evidenced by enhanced proliferation, survival, IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity toward tumors. This was associated with increased JAK-STAT signaling in NK cells in which Cish was deleted. Correspondingly, CIS interacted with the tyrosine kinase JAK1, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and targeting JAK for proteasomal degradation.

Therefore, an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the progression and metastasis of advanced PCa using current genomic approaches is needed. Our miRNA expression signature in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) revealed that microRNA-320a (miR‑320a) was significantly reduced in cancer tissues, suggesting that miR‑320a may be a promising anticancer miRNA. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of miR‑320a in naïve PCa and CRPC cells and to identify miR‑320a-regulated genes involved in PCa metastasis. The expression levels of miR‑320a were significantly reduced in naïve PCa, CRPC specimens, and PCa cell lines. Restoration of mature miR‑320a in PCa cell lines showed that miR‑320a significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, we found that lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) was a direct target of miR‑320a in PCa cells. Silencing of LAMP1 using siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PCa cells. Overexpression of LAMP1 was observed in PCa and CRPC clinical specimens. Moreover, downstream pathways were identified using si-LAMP1-transfected cells. The discovery of tumor-suppressive miR‑320a-mediated pathways may provide important insights into the potential mechanisms of PCa metastasis.""","""['Atsushi Okato', 'Yusuke Goto', 'Akira Kurozumi', 'Mayuko Kato', 'Satoko Kojima', 'Ryosuke Matsushita', 'Masaya Yonemori', 'Kazutaka Miyamoto', 'Tomohiko Ichikawa', 'Naohiko Seki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['MicroRNA expression signature of castration-resistant prostate cancer: the microRNA-221/222 cluster functions as a tumour suppressor and disease progression marker.', 'Regulation of NCAPG by miR-99a-3p (passenger strand) inhibits cancer cell aggressiveness and is involved in CRPC.', 'Dual strands of pre-miR‑150 (miR‑150‑5p and miR‑150‑3p) act as antitumor miRNAs targeting SPOCK1 in naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Microdissecting the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'The roles of microRNAs in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MiR-320a upregulation improves IL-1β-induced osteoarthritis via targeting the DAZAP1 and MAPK pathways.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'The Regulatory Role of Non-coding RNA in Autophagy in Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.', 'Mild hyperthermia induced by gold nanorods acts as a dual-edge blade in the fate of SH-SY5Y cells via autophagy.', 'Androgen Receptor-Related Non-coding RNAs in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We built Huashan risk calculators based on data from 1059 men who underwent initial prostate biopsy from January 2006 to December 2010 in a training cohort. Then, we validated the performance of PSA, PCPT risk calculator, and Huashan risk calculators in an observational validation study from January 2011 to December 2014. All necessary clinical information were collected before the biopsy. The results showed that Huashan risk calculators 1 and 2 outperformed the PCPT risk calculator for predicting PCa in both entire training cohort and stratified population (with PSA from 2.0 ng ml-1 to 20.0 ng m). In the validation study, Huashan risk calculator 1 still outperformed the PCPT risk calculator in the entire validation cohort (0.849 vs 0.779 in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] and stratified population. A considerable reduction of unnecessary biopsies (approximately 30%) was also observed when the Huashan risk calculators were used.

Therefore, diagnostic protocols have to focus equally on efficiency and accuracy. In this paper we introduce 'deep learning' as a technique to improve the objectivity and efficiency of histopathologic slide analysis. Through two examples, prostate cancer identification in biopsy specimens and breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes, we show the potential of this new methodology to reduce the workload for pathologists, while at the same time increasing objectivity of diagnoses. We found that all slides containing prostate cancer and micro- and macro-metastases of breast cancer could be identified automatically while 30-40% of the slides containing benign and normal tissue could be excluded without the use of any additional immunohistochemical markers or human intervention.

Materials and methods:   One hundred sixteen men with prostate specific antigen between 4 and 10ng/ml underwent pre-biopsy MR examinations. Nine of them had HGPIN lesions without concomitant prostate cancer (PCa) on biopsy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and metabolite ratio [Citrate/(Choline+Creatine)] were calculated and these 9 patients were followed to determine the clinical outcomes.  Results:   Mean ADC for HGPIN foci was 1.01±0.16×10(-3)mm(2)/s while for the normal peripheral zone it was 1.69±0.25×10(-3)mm(2)/s (p<0.005). Mean metabolite ratio for voxels in the HGPIN region of initial biopsy was 0.24±0.16 while for the normal peripheral zone the value was 2.66±1.57 (p<0.005). Four of 5 patients who were available for follow-up were detected to have prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. No significant change in metabolite ratio and PSA was observed while ADC showed further reduction on follow-up.  Conclusion:   HGPIN foci have ADC and metabolite ratio values similar to adenocarcinoma prostate, indicating that such patients have a high likelihood of developing cancer.

We examined the relationship between clinical- and treatment-related variables with the onset of UI, defined as leakage requiring pad usage, and further classified as stress (SUI) or urge (UUI) predominant, using univariate and Cox proportional hazards regression models. The changes in International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life domains were assessed from baseline to last follow, and examined by UI status.  Results:   Patients were followed for a median of 6.4 years (interquartile range 4.1-9.3). UI was reported in 108 individuals (4.4%), at a median of 1.8 years (interquartile range 5 months-4.4 years): 30 with SUI and 78 with UUI. Seventy-two men (66.7%) reported using 1, 24 (22.2%) using 2, and 12 (11%) using ≥3 pads per day. On multivariate analysis, post-implantation transurethral resection of the prostate, urinary retention, external beam radiation therapy, and higher pretreatment International Prostate Symptom Score were significantly associated with the development of SUI, although transurethral resection of the prostate was the only significant risk factor associated with SUI. Men experiencing UI reported greater declines in urinary quality of life; however, no significant difference was observed between SUI and UUI.

In the present study, we analyzed the incidence of PC after screening in relation to the number of screening rounds attended in the Finnish section of the trial.  Objective:   To evaluate the possible reduction in PC incidence following completed screening cycles in relation to the number of screening rounds attended.  Design, setting, and participants:   The participants in the screening arm of the Finnish screening trial (29 298 men) were divided into subgroups of men who had participated at one, two, or three screening rounds. A reference group was formed of the 43 151 men in the control arm by selecting age-matched controls for each subgroup of the screening participants. PC cases diagnosed after screening were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry until the end of 2011. Follow-up of the screened men started 12 mo (365 d) after the last screening attendance and a similar date was assigned to the men in the control arm.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1514 new PCs cases (cumulative incidence 5.2%) were diagnosed among the screened men after the last screening attendance. In the reference group formed from the control arm, 2683 cases (6.2%) occurred. The hazard ratio (HR) for PC among nonparticipants in the screening arm was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.99) compared with their controls. Among participants, the HR in those who participated once was 1.39 (95% CI 1.22-1.57), among men who participated twice the HR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.86-1.10), and among men screened three times the HR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.49-0.68). A limitation of the study was that the comparison by attendance is not based on randomization.  Conclusions:   The postscreening PC incidence is reduced after attending three screening rounds, but not after only one or two rounds. Thus, the increased cancer detection at screening is compensated by a subsequent risk reduction only after repeated screening cycles.  Patient summary:   The results of the study indicate that at least three prostate-specific antigen-based screening cycles are needed to reduce subsequent prostate cancer incidence.""","""['Tomi Pakarainen', 'Jani Raitanen', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Paula Kujala', 'Teuvo L Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: Across the Finnish line.', 'The Number of Screening Cycles Needed to Reduce Prostate Cancer Mortality in the Finnish Section of the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.', 'Number of screening rounds attended and incidence of high-risk prostate cancer in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC).', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Risk-stratified multi-round PSA screening for prostate cancer integrating the screening reference level and subgroup-specific progression indicators.', 'Prostate cancer: Across the Finnish line.']"""

A hands-on contouring module was developed to teach delineation of the postoperative prostate clinical target volume (CTV) and improve contouring accuracy.  Methods:   Medical students independently contoured a prostate fossa CTV before and after receiving educational materials and live instruction detailing the RTOG approach to contouring this CTV. Metrics for volume overlap and surface distance (Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance (HD), and mean distance) determined discordance between student and consensus contours. An evaluation assessed perception of session efficacy (1 = ""not at all"" to 5 = ""extremely""; reported as median[interquartile range]). Non-parametric statistical tests were used.  Results:   Twenty-four students at two institutions completed the module, and 21 completed the evaluation (88% response). The content was rated as ""quite"" important (4[3.5-5]). The module improved comfort contouring a prostate fossa (pre 1[1-2] vs. post 4[3-4], p<.01), ability to find references (pre 2[1-3] vs. post 4[3.5-4], p<0.01), knowledge of CT prostate/pelvis anatomy (pre 2[1.5-3] vs. post 3[3-4], p<.01), and ability to use contouring software tools (pre 2[2-3.5] vs. post 3[3-4], p=.01).

There are 3 key issues in ideal EPR-based antitumor drug design: i) stability in blood circulation; ii) tumor-selective accumulation (EPR effect) and efficient release of the active anticancer moiety in tumor tissues; and iii) the active uptake of the active drug into tumor cells. Using these principles, we developed N-(2- hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-conjugated pirarubicin (P-THP), which uses hydrazone bond linkage; it was shown to exhibit prolonged circulation time, thereby resulting in good tumor-selective accumulation. More importantly, the hydrazone bond ensured selective and rapid release of the active drug, pirarubicin (THP), in acidic tumor environments. Further, compared to other anthracycline anticancer drugs (eg, doxorubicin), THP demonstrated more rapid intracellular uptake. Consequently, P-THP showed remarkable antitumor effect with minimal side effects. In a clinical pilot study of a stage IV prostate cancer patient with multiple metastases in the lung and bone, P-THP (50-75 mg administered once every 2-3 weeks) was shown to clear the metastatic nodules in the lung almost completely after 3 treatments where 50-70 mg THP equivalent each was administerd per 70 kg body wt, and bone metastasis disappeared after 6 months. There was no recurrence after 2 years. The patient also retained an excellent quality of life during the treatment without any apparent side effects. Thus, we propose the clinical development of P-THP as an EPR-based tumor-targeted anticancer drug.""","""['Hiroshi Maeda', 'Jun Fang', 'Karel Ulbrich', 'Tomáš Etrych', 'Hideaki Nakamura']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Pronounced Cellular Uptake of Pirarubicin versus That of Other Anthracyclines: Comparison of HPMA Copolymer Conjugates of Pirarubicin and Doxorubicin.', 'Two step mechanisms of tumor selective delivery of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer conjugated with pirarubicin via an acid-cleavable linkage.', 'Synthesis and therapeutic effect of styrene-maleic acid copolymer-conjugated pirarubicin.', 'Development of Tumor-targeting Antitumor Agents Based on Polymer Effect.', 'Polymer-drug conjugates: towards a novel approach for the treatment of endrocine-related cancer.', 'Potential applications and human biosafety of nanomaterials used in nanomedicine.']"""

Objective:   To describe our surgical technique of extrafascial RARP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in locally advanced PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Ninety-four patients with clinical stage ≥T3 undergoing RARP with ePLND at three European centers between 2011 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated.  Surgical procedure:   Surgery was performed using the DaVinci Si system. The anatomically defined ePLND included nodes overlying the external iliac axis, those in the obturator fossa, and around the internal iliac artery up to the ureter. RARP was performed using an extrafascial approach where the Denonvillers' fascia was dissected free and left on the posterior surface of the seminal vesicles.  Measurements:   Perioperative outcomes consisted of operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications occurred within 30 d after surgery. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen values ≥0.2ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed time to BCR and clinical recurrence. Multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed predictors of BCR.  Results and limitations:   Median operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 230min, 200ml, and 6 d. Overall, 12 (12.7%) patients experienced complications and five (5.3%), four (4.3%), and three (3.2%) patients had Clavien I, II, and III/IV complications. Overall, 72 (76.6%), 35 (37.2%), and 30 (32.3%) patients had pT3/4, pN1, and positive margins. The median number of nodes removed was 16. Overall, 19 (20.2%) and 21 (22.3%) patients received adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. The median follow-up was 23.5 mo. At 3-yr follow-up, the BCR- and clinical recurrence-free survival rates were 63.3% and 95.8%. Pathologic stage, Gleason score, and positive margins represented predictors of BCR (all p≤0.03). Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and by the follow-up duration.  Conclusions:   RARP represents a well-standardized, safe, and oncological effective option in patients with locally advanced PCa. Pathologic stage, Gleason score, and positive margins should be considered to select patients for multimodal approaches.  Patient summary:   Robot-assisted surgery represents a well-standardized, safe, and oncological effective option in men with locally advanced prostate cancer. Two out of three patients treated with this approach are free from recurrence at 3-yr follow-up.

Methods and materials:   This was a cohort study of 7399 men in whom comorbidity (including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or myocardial infarction) was assessed and recorded with T1-3NxM0 PC treated with brachytherapy with or without neoadjuvant RT, October 1997 to May 2013 at a single providing institution. Cox and competing risks regression analyses were used to assess whether men with unfavorable-intermediate/high-risk versus favorable-intermediate/low-risk PC were at increased risk of PC-specific, all-cause, or other-cause mortality (PCSM, ACM, OCM), adjusting for number of comorbidities, age at and year of brachytherapy, RT use, and an RT treatment propensity score.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 935 men died: 80 of PC and 855 of other causes. Among men with no comorbidity, PCSM risk (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 2.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-5.06], P=.001) and ACM risk (AHR 1.30 [95% CI 1.07-1.58], P=.007) were significantly increased in men with unfavorable-intermediate/high-risk PC versus favorable-intermediate/low-risk PC, with no difference in OCM (P=.07). Although PCSM risk was increased in men with 1 comorbidity (AHR 2.87 [95% CI 1.11-7.40], P=.029), ACM risk was not (AHR 1.03 [95% CI 0.78-1.36], P=.84). Neither PCSM risk (AHR 4.39 [95% CI 0.37-51.98], P=.24) or ACM risk (AHR 1.43 [95% CI 0.83-2.45], P=.20) was increased in men with 2 comorbidities.

Here, we performed in vitro biopanning of the PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell line to select prostate cancer-specific peptides by phage display. We successfully identified specific peptides targeting prostate cancer cells, and their specificity was confirmed by cellular ELISA and flow cytometry. Moreover, we found that the phage clones also recognize other prostate cancer cell lines and surgical specimens from prostate cancer patients. The tumor targeting ability of these phages was validated in a xenograft model, in which high accumulation of targeting phage was observed. To investigate whether selected peptides are able to target tumors and enhance drug delivery into cancer cells, we synthesized peptide-PEGylated lipids and post-inserted them into preformed liposomal doxorubicin and vinorelbine. The results of our cellular uptake and MTT assays indicate that peptide-conjugated liposomes exhibit enhanced drug intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity. The conjugation of targeting peptide to imaging agents, such as quantum dots (QDs) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), results in more precise delivery of these agents to tumor sites. Furthermore, administration of liposomal doxorubicin and vinorelbine conjugated with targeting peptides was found to markedly increase the inhibition of human prostate tumor growth in mouse xenograft and orthotopic models.

Neuromonitoring methods have been developed to identify and preserve the complex pelvic autonomic nervous system in order to maintain patients' quality of life. So far no randomized study has been published dealing with the role of neuromonitoring in rectal cancer surgery.  Methods/design:   NEUROS is a prospective two-arm randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial comparing the functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME) with and without pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM). A total of 188 patients will be included. Primary endpoint is the urinary function measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score. Secondary endpoints consist of sexual, anorectal functional outcome and safety, especially oncologic safety and quality of TME. Sexual function is assessed in females with the Female Sexual Function Index and in males with the International Index of Erectile Function. For evaluation of anorectal function the Wexner-Vaizey score is used. Functional evaluation is scheduled before radiochemotherapy (if applicable), preoperatively (baseline), before hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months after stoma closure and 12 months after surgery. For assessment of safety adverse events, the rates of positive resection margins and quality of mesorectum are documented.  Discussion:   This study will provide high quality evidence on the efficacy of pIONM aiming for improvement of functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME.

Progranulin contributes, as an autocrine growth factor, to the transformed phenotype by modulating Akt-and MAPK-driven motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. Progranulin also induces F-actin remodeling by interacting with the F-actin binding protein drebrin. In addition, progranulin is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancer compared to normal tissue controls, suggesting that progranulin might play a key role in driving the transition to the invasive phenotype of urothelial cancer. However, it is not established whether targeting progranulin could have therapeutic effects on bladder cancer. In this study, we stably depleted urothelial cancer cells of endogenous progranulin by shRNA approaches and determined that progranulin depletion severely inhibited the ability of tumorigenic urothelial cancer cells to migrate, invade and grow in anchorage-independency. We further demonstrate that progranulin expression is critical for tumor growth in vivo, in both xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. Notably, progranulin levels correlated with response to cisplatin treatment and were upregulated in bladder tumors.

MLN4924 (also known as Pevonedistat), a specific inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme, has recently entered phase I/II clinical trials in several malignancies. By inhibiting cullin neddylation, MLN4924 inactivates Cullin-RING ligases (CRL), which have been validated as an attractive radiosensitizing target. In our study, we demonstrate that MLN4924 can be used as a potent radiosensitizer in hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells. We found that MLN4924 inhibited cullin neddylation and sensitized prostate cancer cells to irradiation (IR). Mechanistically, MLN4924 enhanced IR-induced G2 cell-cycle arrest, by inducing accumulation of WEE1/p21/p27, three well-known CRL substrates. Importantly, siRNA knockdown of WEE1/p21/p27 partially abrogated MLN4924-induced G2 cell-cycle arrest, indicating a causal role of WEE1/p21/p27 in MLN4924-induced radiosensitization. Further mechanistic studies revealed that induction of DNA damage and apoptosis also contributed to MLN4924 radiosensitization in hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells.

A better understanding of PCa progression and key molecular mechanisms could bring novel therapies to light. One potential therapeutic target is ERG, a transcription factor aberrantly up-regulated in PCa due to chromosomal rearrangements between androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 and ERG. Here we show that the most common PCa-associated truncated ERG T1-E4 (ERGΔ39), encoded by fusion between TMPRSS2 exon 1 and ERG exon 4, binds to bromodomain-1 (BD1) of bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family. This interaction is partially abrogated by BET inhibitors JQ1 and iBET762. Meta-analysis of published ERG (T1-E4) and BRD4 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data demonstrates overlap in a substantial portion of their binding sites. Gene expression profile analysis shows some ERG-BRD4 co-target genes are upregulated in CRPC compared to hormone-naïve counterparts. We provide further evidence that ERG-mediated invasion of PCa cells was significantly enhanced by an acetylation-mimicking mutation in ERG that augments the ERG-BRD4 interaction. Our findings reveal that PCa-associated ERG can interact and co-occupy with BRD4 in the genome, and suggest this druggable interaction is critical for ERG-mediated cell invasion and PCa progression.""","""['Alexandra M Blee', 'Shujun Liu', 'Liguo Wang', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.', 'Therapeutic targeting of BET bromodomain proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of BRD4 suppresses tumor growth in prostate cancer via the enhancement of FOXO1 expression.', 'Role of BET proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Protein acylation: mechanisms, biological functions and therapeutic targets.', 'Prognostic role of overexpressed Bromodomain and extra-terminal family in ovarian cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'FET fusion oncoproteins interact with BRD4 and SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex subtypes in sarcoma.', 'Transcriptional network involving ERG and AR orchestrates Distal-less\xa0homeobox-1 mediated prostate cancer progression.']"""

It prolongs survival of CRPC patients, but its overall survival benefit is relatively modest (4.8 months) and by 24 months most patients progress on enzalutamide. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying enzalutamide resistance remain elusive. Herein, we report enzalutamide treatment-induced alterations of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated enhancer RNAs (AR-eRNAs) and their roles in enzalutamide-resistant growth and survival of CRPC cells. AR chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq analyses revealed that 188 and 227 AR-eRNAs were differentially expressed in enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP and C4-2 cells, respectively. The AR-eRNAs upregulated in C4-2 cells and downregulated in LNCaP cells were selected through meta-analysis. Expression of AR-eRNAs and related mRNAs in the loci of FTO, LUZP2, MARC1 and NCAM2 were further verified by real-time RT-PCR. Silencing of LUZP2 inhibited, but silencing of MARC1 increased the growth of enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 cells. Intriguingly, meta-analysis showed that expression of LUZP2 mRNA increased in primary tumors compared to normal prostate tissues, but decreased again in metastatic CRPC.

Methods:   We analysed the levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in patients with elevated PSA who were diagnosed with either localised PCa (n=36) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n=31) upon biopsy. Real-time RT-PCR with Taqman probes was used to measure plasma levels of miRNAs. To circumvent problems associated with circulating miRNA quantitation, we computed the expression ratios of upregulated and downregulated miRNAs.  Results:   The miR-106a/miR-130b and miR-106a/miR-223 ratios were significantly different between the biopsy-positive and BPH groups (P<0.0001), and yielded statistical power values that were >0.99.

Objective:   To evaluate combined risk stratification utility of common low penetrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiologic risk factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a total of 17 171 cases and 19 862 controls sampled from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) and 5879 women participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, a model for predicting absolute risk of breast cancer was developed combining information on individual level data on epidemiologic risk factors and 24 genotyped SNPs from prospective cohort studies, published estimate of odds ratios for 68 additional SNPs, population incidence rate from the National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry and data on risk factor distribution from nationally representative health survey. The model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality.  Exposures:   Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors, menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors.  Main outcomes and measures:   Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT], alcohol, and smoking).  Results:   The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3%. A model that includes all risk factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4% to 23.5% for women in the bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5% to 25.0%, respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an average woman in the general population.  Conclusions and relevance:   This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors.

Androgen receptor (AR), a member of transcription factor, plays an essential role in prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression. Here, we demonstrate that BAP18 is identified as a coactivator of AR in Drosophilar experimental system and mammalian cells. BAP18 facilitates the recruitment of MLL1 subcomplex and AR to androgen-response element (ARE) of AR target genes, subsequently increasing histone H3K4 trimethylation and H4K16 acetylation. Knockdown of BAP18 attenuates cell growth and proliferation of PCa cells. Moreover, BAP18 depletion results in inhibition of xenograft tumor growth in mice even under androgen-depletion conditions. In addition, our data show that BAP18 expression in clinical PCa samples is higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Methods:   We evaluated 247 patients who underwent either radical retropubic prostatectomy or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy at a single institution from 2008 to 2013 by one of four surgeons. Patient characteristics were compared using t-tests, rank sum or χ(2) -tests as appropriate. The association between positive end-expiratory pressure and estimated blood loss was tested using linear regression.  Results:   Patients were classified into high (≥4 cmH2 O) and low (≤1 cmH2 O) positive-end expiratory pressure groups. Estimated blood loss in radical retropubic prostatectomy was higher in the high positive end-expiratory pressure group (1000 mL vs 800 mL, P = 0.042). Estimated blood loss in robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy was lower in the high positive end-expiratory pressure group (150 mL vs 250 mL, P = 0.015). After adjusting for other factors known to influence blood loss, a 5-cmH2 O increase in positive end-expiratory pressure was associated with a 34.9% increase in estimated blood loss (P = 0.030) for radical retropubic prostatectomy, and a 33.0% decrease for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (P = 0.038).  Conclusions:   In radical retropubic prostatectomy, high positive end-expiratory pressure was associated with higher estimated blood loss, and the benefits of positive end-expiratory pressure should be weighed against the risk of increased estimated blood loss.

The use of GEMMs and derived cell lines represent powerful tools to study prostate cancer initiation and progression with an associated tumor microenvironment. Notably, such models provide the capacity for rapid preclinical therapy studies including immune therapies for prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   Backcrossing FVB Hi-MYC mice with C57BL/6N mice, we established a Hi-MYC transgenic mouse model on a C57BL/6 background (B6MYC). In addition, using a conditional reprogramming method, a novel C57BL/6 MYC driven prostate adenocarcinoma cell line was generated.  Results:   Our results demonstrate that disease progression is significantly delayed in B6MYC when compared to their FVB counterparts. Current data also indicates infiltrating immune cells are present in pre-cancer lesions, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Further, immunophenotyping of this immune infiltrate demonstrates the predominant population as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Also, we successfully generated a B6MYC-CaP cell line, and determined that this new PCa cell line express markers of luminal epithelial lineage.  Discussion:   This novel model of PCa provides a new platform to understand the cross talk between MYC driven prostate cancer and the microenvironment. Importantly, these models will be an ideal tool to support the clinical development of immunotherapy as well as other novel therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer treatment.

In ∼700 men without prostate cancer and two replication cohorts (N ∼ 900 and ∼9,000), we examined the properties of these SNPS as instrumental variables (IVs) for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3.

IV analysis was used in an attempt to estimate the causal effect of circulating IGF peptides on prostate cancer. Published SNPs in the IGFBP1/IGFBP3 gene region, particularly rs11977526, were strong instruments for IGF-II and IGFBP-3, less so for IGF-I.

It enables bicarbonate transport across the plasma membrane, neutralizing intracellular pH and conferring to cancer cells a survival advantage in hypoxic/acidic microenvironments. Overexpression of carbonic anhydrase IX in cancer tissues is regulated by hypoxia inducible factor 1α - mediated transcription and the enzyme is considered a marker of tumor hypoxia and poor outcome. The role of carbonic anhydrase IX in prostate cancer has not been fully clarified and controversy has arisen on whether this enzyme is overexpressed in hypoxic prostate cancer tissues.  Methods:   We analyzed the expression of carbonic anhydrase IX and hypoxia inducible factor 1α in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC-3, and in 110 cancer biopsies, by western blotting and immunocyto/histochemistry.  Results:   In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, carbonic anhydrase IX was mostly cytoplasmic/nuclear, with very limited membrane localization. Nuclear staining became stronger under hypoxia. When we analyzed carbonic anhydrase IX expression in human prostate cancer biopsies, we found that protein staining positively correlated with hypoxia inducible factor 1α and with Gleason pattern and score, as well as with the novel grading system proposed by the International Society of Urological Pathology for prostate cancer. Once more, carbonic anhydrase IX was mainly cytoplasmic in low grade carcinomas, whereas in high grade tumors was strongly expressed in the nucleus of the neoplastic cell. An association between carbonic anhydrase IX expression level and the main clinic-pathological features involved in prostate cancer aggressiveness was identified.  Conclusions:   There was a statistically significant association between carbonic anhydrase IX and hypoxia inducible factor 1α in prostate cancer tissues, that identifies the enzyme as a reliable marker of tumor hypoxia. In addition, carbonic anhydrase IX expression positively correlated with prostate cancer grading and staging, and with outcome, suggesting that the protein may be an independent prognosticator for the disease. The nuclear translocation of the enzyme in hypoxic cancer cells may epitomize a biological switch of the tumor towards a less favorable phenotype.""","""['Maria Raffaella Ambrosio', 'Claudia Di Serio', 'Giovanna Danza', 'Bruno Jim Rocca', 'Alessandro Ginori', 'Igor Prudovsky', 'Niccolò Marchionni', 'Maria Teresa Del Vecchio', 'Francesca Tarantini']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Diagn Pathol""","""['Coexpression of hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha and 2alpha, carbonic anhydrase IX, and vascular endothelial growth factor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and relationship to survival.', 'Immunohistochemical detection of osteopontin in advanced head-and-neck cancer: prognostic role and correlation with oxygen electrode measurements, hypoxia-inducible-factor-1alpha-related markers, and hemoglobin levels.', 'Carbonic anhydrase IX expression in prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia inducible carbonic anhydrase IX, marker of tumour hypoxia, survival pathway and therapy target.', 'Is the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway important in gastric cancer?', ""Exosome Analysis in Prostate Cancer: How They Can Improve Biomarkers' Performance."", 'Targeting GSTP1 as Therapeutic Strategy against Lung Adenocarcinoma Stemness and Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.', 'Focused Ultrasound Stimulation of Microbubbles in Combination With Radiotherapy for Acute Damage of Breast Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'SPHK/HIF-1α Signaling Pathway Has a Critical Role in Chrysin-Induced Anticancer Activity in Hypoxia-Induced PC-3 Cells.', 'Expression and prognostic value of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) in bladder urothelial carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   We examined prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and VCaP expressing mutated and wild-type ARs, respectively, to clarify the significance of NCOAs in the effect of antiandrogens. Hydroxyflutamide showed antagonistic activity against VCaP and an agonistic effect on LNCaP. Bicalutamide served as an antagonist for both. We analyzed mRNA transcription and protein expression of NCOAs in these cells pretreated with dihydrotestosterone and thereafter treated with the mentioned antiandrogens. Transcriptional silencing of candidate NCOAs and AR was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation was evaluated with MTT assay.  Results:   LNCaP treated with bicalutamide showed an about four-fold increase in the expression of NCOA2 mRNA compared to those pretreated with dihydrotestosterone alone (P <0.01). In VCaP pretreated with dihydrotestosterone, transcriptions of NCOA2 and NCOA7 were slightly increased with bicalutamide (1.96- and 2.42-fold, respectively) and hydroxyflutamide (1.33-fold in both). With Western blotting, the expression of NCOA2 protein also increased in LNCaP cells treated with bicalutamide compared with that in control cells pretreated with dihydrotestosterone alone. Following silencing with siRNA for NCOA2, PSA levels in media with LNCaP receiving bicalutamide were elevated compared with those in non-silencing controls (101.6 ± 4.2 vs. 87.8 ± 1.4 ng/mL, respectively, P =0.0495). In LNCaP cells treated with dihydrotestosterone and bicalutamide, NCOA2-silencing was associated with a higher proliferation activity compared with non-silencing control and AR-silencing.  Conclusion:   NCOA2, which has been thought to be recruited as a coactivator, possibly plays a corepressive role in AR of prostate cancer cells when treated with antiandrogens, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.""","""['Keisuke Takeda', 'Noboru Hara', 'Tsutomu Nishiyama', 'Masayuki Tasaki', 'Fumio Ishizaki', 'Yoshihiko Tomita']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A novel steroidal antiandrogen targeting wild type and mutant androgen receptors.', 'Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of androgen receptor as a determinant of androgen agonistic or antagonistic activity.', 'The antiandrogen bicalutamide activates the androgen receptor (AR) with a mutation in codon 741 through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK) pathway in human prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a target in androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor mutations in carcinoma of the prostate: significance for endocrine therapy.', 'Comparative Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of the Impact of Androgen Stimulation and Darolutamide Inhibition.', 'The Transcriptomic Landscape of Prostate Cancer Development and Progression: An Integrative Analysis.']"""

Abiraterone is metabolized in patients to Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which has even greater anti-tumour activity and is structurally similar to endogenous steroidal 5α-reductase substrates, such as testosterone. Here, we show that D4A is converted to at least three 5α-reduced and three 5β-reduced metabolites in human serum. The initial 5α-reduced metabolite, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is present at higher concentrations than D4A in patients with prostate cancer taking abiraterone, and is an androgen receptor agonist, which promotes prostate cancer progression. In a clinical trial of abiraterone alone, followed by abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor), 3-keto-5α-abiraterone and downstream metabolites were depleted by the addition of dutasteride, while D4A concentrations rose, showing that dutasteride effectively blocks production of a tumour-promoting metabolite and permits D4A accumulation. Furthermore, dutasteride did not deplete the three 5β-reduced metabolites, which were also clinically detectable, demonstrating the specific biochemical effects of pharmacological 5α-reductase inhibition on abiraterone metabolism.

However, its high-risk variants exhibit variable behaviour. We analyse the factors that affect BR and CSS (multivariate, Kaplan Meier).  Methods:   From 1997 to 2013, 657 patients were operated of a high-grade prostate cancer (pT2b 7.2%, pT3a 73%, pT3b 18.3%, pT4 1.5%). Gleason score was ≥8 in 23% of cases. Percentage of PSMs was 46.1%. Mean follow-up was 113 months (24-192).  Results:   BR occurred in 36.5%. Patients with Gleason score <8, 31.7% had BR, Gleason ≥8 had BR in 48% (p<0.05). PSMs recurrence occurred in 48.9%, whereas 26.1% in NSM (p<0.05). If lymphadenectomy, BR occurred in 48.7%, if not 30.9% (p<0,05). In multivariate analysis, stage, Gleason≥8 and PSMs were independent factors for BR. Treatment of BR was 36.5% radiotherapy, 24.1% HT, and 21.2% both simultaneously. Active surveillance was performed in 13.3%. Disease progression (biochemical or radiological) occurred in 23.5%. CSS was 98.93%, pT4 was the stage with the greatest mortality (10%), followed by pT3b (3.4%), p<0.05. Patients with a Gleason score ≥8 accounted for 71% CSM (p<0,05). PSMs and lymphadenectomy didn't have repercussions for survival. In multivariate analysis, Gleason≥8 was independent factor for CSM.

Herein, the authors compared national trends in use, complications, and costs of SBRT with those of traditional radiotherapies.  Methods:   The authors identified men who underwent SBRT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer between 2004 and 2011 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare linked data. Temporal trend of therapy use was assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Two-year outcomes were compared using the chi-square test. Median treatment costs were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   A total of 542 men received SBRT, 9647 received brachytherapy, 23,408 received IMRT, and 800 men were treated with proton beam therapy. There was a significant increase in the use of SBRT and proton beam therapy (P<.001), whereas brachytherapy use decreased (P<.001). A higher percentage of patients treated with SBRT and brachytherapy had low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤ 6 vs ≥ 7) compared with individuals treated with IMRT and proton beam therapy (54.0% and 64.2% vs 35.2% and 49.6%, respectively; P<.001). SBRT compared with brachytherapy and IMRT was associated with equivalent gastrointestinal toxicity but more erectile dysfunction at 2-year follow-up (P<.001). SBRT was associated with more urinary incontinence compared with IMRT and proton beam therapy but less compared with brachytherapy (P<.001, respectively). The median cost of SBRT was $27,145 compared with $17,183 for brachytherapy, $37,090 for IMRT, and $54,706 for proton beam therapy (P<.001).  Conclusions:   The use of SBRT and proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer has increased over time. Despite men of lower disease stage undergoing SBRT, SBRT was found to be associated with greater toxicity but lower health care costs compared with IMRT and proton beam therapy.

All patients were intravenously injected with 80-mL bolus of nonionic iodinated contrast medium during cine-mode acquisition protocol. Perfusion data sets were analyzed by a dedicated software system and values for each of the 4 CTp parameters (blood volume, blood flow, mean transit time, and permeability surface-area product measurements) were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to find which CTp parameter and which cutoff value might reveal the best diagnostic accuracy. Histopathology was used as reference standard.  Results:   Statistical correlation between radiological and pathological results was performed on 48 patients using 3456 segmented squares. Blood volume and permeability surface revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for differentiating between malignant and benign squares, with cutoff values of 6.1 and 16.5, respectively, and a sensitivity of 84.8% and 81.8%, respectively. All parameters showed also a high negative predictive value: 97.1% for blood volume and 95.4% for permeability surface.  Conclusions:   Blood volume and permeability surface are the 2 CTp parameters with the highest diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between normal tissue and prostatic neoplasia.

However, it has been recently proposed that ZA could have direct anti-tumour effects, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. We herein unravel a novel anti-tumour activity of ZA in prostate cancer (PCa), by targeting the pro-tumorigenic properties of both stromal and immune cells. Particularly, we demonstrate that ZA impairs PCa-induced M2-macrophages polarization, reducing their pro-invasive effect on tumour cells and their pro-angiogenic features. Crucially, ZA administration reverts cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) activation by targeting the mevalonate pathway and RhoA geranyl-geranylation, thereby impairing smooth muscle actin-α fibers organization, a prerequisite of fibroblast activation. Moreover, ZA prevents the M2 macrophages-mediated activation of normal fibroblast, highlighting the broad efficacy of this drug on tumour microenvironment. These results are confirmed in a metastatic xenograft PCa mouse model in which ZA-induced stromal normalization impairs cancer-stromal cells crosstalk, resulting in a significant reduction of primary tumour growth and metastases. Overall these findings reinforce the efficacy of ZA as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce cancer aggressiveness, by abrogating the supportive role of tumour microenvironment.""","""['Giuseppina Comito', 'Coral Pons Segura', 'Maria Letizia Taddei', 'Michele Lanciotti', 'Sergio Serni', 'Andrea Morandi', 'Paola Chiarugi', 'Elisa Giannoni']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Zoledronic acid modulates antitumoral responses of prostate cancer-tumor associated macrophages.', 'Zoledronic acid repolarizes tumour-associated macrophages and inhibits mammary carcinogenesis by targeting the mevalonate pathway.', 'Zoledronic acid inhibits macrophage/microglia-assisted breast cancer cell invasion.', 'Tumour macrophages as potential targets of bisphosphonates.', 'Diverse macrophages polarization in tumor microenvironment.', 'Therapeutic strategies for gastric cancer targeting immune cells: Future directions.', 'Reprogramming the tumor microenvironment to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.', 'Do disease status and race affect the efficacy of zoledronic acid in patients with prostate cancer?

We estimated the probabilities of referral to radical treatment while on AS, depending on disease stage, using data from the Johns Hopkins AS cohort. We sampled 10 million men, representative of the US population, and projected the effects of applying AS protocols that differed by time between biopsies and compared these with the effects of treating men immediately.  Results:   We found that AS with yearly follow-up biopsies for men with low-risk prostate cancer (≤ T2a stage and Gleason 6) increases the probability of PCM to 2.6% (1% increase) and reduces overtreatment from 2.5 to 2.1% (18.4% reduction). With biopsies every 3 years after the first year, PCM increases by 2.3% and overtreatment reduces from 2.5 to 1.9% (30.3% reduction). The inclusion of men in the intermediate-risk group (> T2a stage or Gleason 3+4) in AS protocols increases PCM by 2.7% and reduces overtreatment from 2.5 to 2.0% (23.1% reduction).

However, the prognostic significance of PLR has not been investigated in the prostate cancer (PCa) patients receiving hormonal therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of PLR in PCa patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   Two-hundred-ninety prostate cancer patients who had undergone ADT as first-line therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The blood cell counts were performed at the time of diagnosis. PLR was calculated as the ratio of platelet count to lymphocyte count. Patients were categorized in two groups using a cut-off point of 117.58 as calculated by the receiver-operating curve analysis. Correlations between PLR and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Meanwhile, univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to determine the associations of PLR with progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Prognostic accuracy was evaluated with the Harrell concordance index.  Results:   The differences of age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, risk stratification and incidence of metastasis between low PLR group (<117.58) and high PLR group (≥117.58) were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Multivariate analyses identified PLR as an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.581, p = 0.013), CSS (HR = 1.768, p = 0.037) and OS (HR = 1.650, p = 0.044). The addition of PLR to the final model improved predictive accuracy (c-index: 0.747, 0.801 and 0.768) for PFS, CSS and OS compared with the clinicopathological base model (c-index: 0.730, 0.778 and 0.746), which included Gleason score and incidence of metastasis.  Conclusions:   PLR might play a significant role in the prognosis of PCa patients treated with ADT.

Prior to the PSA era, up to 27% of prostate cancers were detected incidentally at the time of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). After PSA testing became widely available, the incidence of incidentally detected carcinoma prostate in TURP specimens without prior diagnosis reduced to 5-13%. However, the incidence of incidentally detected carcinoma prostate has been reported to vary across the globe since various factors can influence the identification of this malignancy in TURP specimens. In this paper, we focus on rates of incidentally detected prostate cancer in TURP specimens in our hospital and correlate it with various parameters.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study of histopathological findings of biopsy specimens was conducted for patients undergoing TURP during a period of 5 years from April 2010. The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (digital rectal examination (DRE) not showing any abnormally hard areas and normal age adjusted PSA values). Patients with elevated PSA, abnormal DRE, documented urinary tract infection and proved adenocarcinoma prostate (CaP) were excluded from the study. The total weight of prostatectomy specimen, occurrence of carcinoma prostate in the chips, percentage of total tissue resected showing malignancy and Gleason's scores were recorded.  Results:   A total of 597 patients belonging to the inclusion criteria were studied. The incidence of occult CaP in the study group was 5.2 % (31/597). Out of these, 8 belonged to T1a and 23 belonged to T1b stages. The age group 70 - 79 years had the maximum incidence of occult CaP. It was observed that the clinical grading of prostate did not have a bearing on the incidence of occult CaP whereas the weight of resected specimen correlated with the incidence of CaP. The incidence of occult CaP was greater with low volume prostates (<20 g). (P=0.15).  Conclusions:   The rate of incidentally detected adenocarcinoma prostate in patients undergoing TURP for clinically diagnosed BPH was found to be only 5.2 % in our study which is low when compared with similar studies done elsewhere. The age of the patient and weight of the resected specimen correlated with incidence of occult prostate cancer.

Insofar as blood provides a specific microenvironment for tumor cells, we explored a potential link between EMT and coagulation that may provide EMT-positive CTCs with enhanced colonizing properties. Here we report that EMT induces tissue factor (TF), a major cell-associated initiator of coagulation and related procoagulant properties in the blood. TF blockade by antibody or shRNA diminished the procoagulant activity of EMT-positive cells, confirming a functional role for TF in these processes. Silencing the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 inhibited both EMT-associated TF expression and coagulant activity, further strengthening the link between EMT and coagulation. Accordingly, EMT-positive cells exhibited a higher persistance/survival in the lungs of mice colonized after intravenous injection, a feature diminished by TF or ZEB1 silencing. In tumor cells with limited metastatic capability, enforcing expression of the EMT transcription factor Snail increased TF, coagulant properties, and early metastasis.

Accumulating evidence has implicated important regulatory roles of epigenetic modifications in the occurrence and progression of HCC. In the present study, we analyzed 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels in the tumor tissues and paired adjacent peritumor tissues (APTs) from four individual HCC patients using a (hydroxy)methylated DNA immunoprecipitation approach combined with deep sequencing [(h)MeDIP-Seq]. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 5-mC levels in the promoter regions of 2796 genes and the 5-hmC levels in 507 genes differed significantly between HCC tissues and APTs. These differential genes were grouped into various clusters and pathways and found to be particularly enriched in the 'metabolic pathways' that include 'Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis', 'Oxidative phosphorylation' and 'Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)', implicating a potential role of metabolic alterations in HCC. Furthermore, 144 genes had both 5-mC and 5-hmC changes in HCC patients, and 10 of them (PCNA, MDM2, STAG1, E2F4, FGF4, FGF19, RHOBTB2, UBE2QL1, DCN and HSP90AA1) were enriched and interconnected in five pathways including the 'Cell cycle', 'Pathway in cancer', 'Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis', 'Melanoma' and 'Prostate cancer' pathways. The genome-wide mapping of 5-mC and 5-hmC in HCC tissues and APTs indicated that both 5-mC and 5-hmC epigenetic modifications play important roles in the regulation of HCC, and there may be some interconnections between them. Taken together, in the present study we conducted the first genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation combined with hydroxymethylation in HBV-related HCC and provided a series of potential novel epigenetic biomarkers for HCC.""","""['Chao Ye', 'Ran Tao', 'Qingyi Cao', 'Danhua Zhu', 'Yini Wang', 'Jie Wang', 'Juan Lu', 'Ermei Chen', 'Lanjuan Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Genome-wide identification of blood DNA methylation patterns associated with early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma development in hepatitis B carriers.', 'Genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation analysis reveal human menstrual blood-derived stem cells inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma growth through oncogenic pathway suppression via regulating 5-hmC in enhancer elements.', 'Comparison of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma by viral status.', 'Integrative analysis of aberrant Wnt signaling in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Conceptual models for the initiation of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Decrease of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma: A cross-sectional study.', 'Cytochrome P450 enzymes mediated by DNA methylation is involved in deoxynivalenol-induced hepatoxicity in piglets.', 'An integrated analysis of the effects of maternal broccoli sprouts exposure on transcriptome and methylome in prevention of offspring mammary cancer.', 'Cellular Id1 inhibits hepatitis B virus transcription by interacting with the novel covalently closed circular DNA-binding protein E2F4.', 'A novel panel based on immune infiltration and tumor mutational burden for prognostic prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) and QoL after treatment in localized prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   A prospective single-center clinical study was performed in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients received 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SHARP regimen). Acute and late toxicity was assessed according to RTOG/EORTC score. Patients filled out EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires.  Results:   The analysis included 68 prostate cancer patients (55-83 years, median 73) with clinical stage T1c-T2cN0M0, median combined Gleason score of 6 (3-8), and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 ng/mL (4-20 ng/mL). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was given to 52 patients (76.5 %), and stopped in 31 patients (45.5 %) after 6 months; in 21 patients (31 %) after 2-3 years. Average and median follow-up was 24 months (18-45). Median nadir PSA level was 0.03 ng/mL for all patients and 0.6 ng/mL for patients without hormone treatment. No patients had PSA failure. There were no acute grade IV toxicities. One patient (1.5 %) developed grade III and 24 patients (35.3 %) grade II acute bladder toxicity. No one developed grade III and 7 patients (10.3 %) grade II acute rectal toxicity. No grade III or IV late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities were reported. Grade II late urinary symptoms were observed in 8 patients (11.8 %) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 3 patients (4.4 %). Global health status/QoL was good and improved during the observational period.  Conclusion:   SBRT for prostate cancer patients is a well-tolerated treatment in terms of toxicity and QoL, has no negative impact on functioning and everyday life, with the important benefit of a short treatment period.

In this study we compare multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography of the prostate with whole mount ex vivo prostate histopathology to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of these imaging modalities for detecting and locating tumor foci within the prostate.  Materials and methods:   In a prospective clinical trial setting 20 patients with localized prostate cancer and a planned radical prostatectomy were recruited. All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography before surgery, and whole mount histopathology slides were directly compared to the images. European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for reporting magnetic resonance imaging were used as a template for regional units of analysis. The uropathologist and radiologists were blinded to individual components of the study, and the final correlation was performed by visual and deformable registration analysis.  Results:   A total of 50 clinically significant lesions were identified from the whole mount histopathological analysis. Based on regional analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were 44%, 94%, 81% and 76%, respectively. With prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 49%, 95%, 85% and 88%, respectively. Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography yielded a higher specificity and positive predictive value.  Conclusions:   A significant proportion of cancers are potentially missed and underestimated by both imaging modalities. Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography may be used in addition to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to help improve local staging in those patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy.""","""['H Rhee', 'P Thomas', 'B Shepherd', 'S Gustafson', 'I Vela', 'P J Russell', 'C Nelson', 'E Chung', 'G Wood', 'G Malone', 'S Wood', 'P Heathcote']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET/MRI Improves the Localization of Primary Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography for Primary Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Men with Contraindications to or Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Prospective Observational Study.', '18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Localization of Dominant Intraprostatic Foci: First Experience.', 'Prostate Cancer: Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron-emission Tomography/Computed Tomography or Positron-emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Staging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'PI-RADS-Based Segmented Threshold of PSMA-PET SUVmax Is Better than Traditional Fixed Threshold for Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Especially for PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Detecting localised prostate cancer using radiomic features in PSMA PET and multiparametric MRI for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'External validation of a convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of intraprostatic tumor lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET images.', 'Focal cryotherapy for prostate cancer: a contemporary literature review.']"""

However, the molecular interactions underlying the recruitment of components are not well understood. Herein, we study how the ability to form higher-order assemblies influences the recruitment of the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) to nuclear speckles. SPOP, a cullin-3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) substrate adaptor, self-associates into higher-order oligomers; that is, the number of monomers in an oligomer is broadly distributed and can be large. While wild-type SPOP localizes to liquid nuclear speckles, self-association-deficient SPOP mutants have a diffuse distribution in the nucleus. SPOP oligomerizes through its BTB and BACK domains. We show that BTB-mediated SPOP dimers form linear oligomers via BACK domain dimerization, and we determine the concentration-dependent populations of the resulting oligomeric species. Higher-order oligomerization of SPOP stimulates CRL3(SPOP) ubiquitination efficiency for its physiological substrate Gli3, suggesting that nuclear speckles are hotspots of ubiquitination.

Methods:   We identified 5991 survivors age 65 and older of prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, bladder, kidney, head and neck, and gynecologic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey resource. Survivors completed surveys pre- and post-cancer diagnosis on 13 chronic conditions and functional status. Among those with ≥2 conditions, exploratory factor analysis identified clusters of conditions. Differences in cluster frequency from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis were evaluated across the top five cancer types using chi-square tests. Modified Poisson regression models estimated the relative risk of developing clusters post-diagnosis. Chi-square tests evaluated associations between function and clusters.  Results:   Clusters included the following: cardiovascular disease cluster (pre 6.1 % and post 7.7 %), musculoskeletal cluster (28.2 % and 29.3 %), metabolic cluster (14.9 % and 17.6 %), and the major depressive disorder risk (MDDr) + gastrointestinal (GI) + pulmonary condition cluster (5.8 % and 8.7 %).

Functional impairment was more prevalent in survivors with defined clusters, especially in MDDr + GI + pulmonary, compared to survivors with ≥2 un-clustered conditions.  Conclusions:   Distinct condition clusters of two or more chronic conditions are prevalent among older cancer survivors.

To understand survivors' information-seeking experiences, we examined the topics of their information searches, their overall perceptions of the search, and perceptions of their health information seeking self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in their ability to obtain information). We hypothesized that negative search experiences and lower health information seeking self-efficacy would be associated with certain survivor characteristics such as non-white race, low income, and less education.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study using data from the Michigan Prostate Cancer Survivor Study (state-based survey of long-term prostate cancer survivor outcomes, N = 2499, response rate = 38 %). Participants recalled their last search for information and reported the topics and overall experience. We conducted multivariable regression to examine the association between survivor characteristics and the information-seeking experience.  Results:   Nearly a third (31.7 %) of prostate cancer survivors (median age of 76 years and 9 years since diagnosis) reported having negative information-seeking experiences when looking for information. However, only 13.4 % reported having low health information-seeking self-efficacy. Lower income and less education were both significantly associated with negative information-seeking experiences.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that many long-term prostate cancer survivors have negative experiences when searching for information, and lower income and less education were survivor factors related to negative information-seeking experiences.

In addition, whether BKCa is involved in metastasis of prostate cancer remains to be explored. Here, we report that BKCa is overexpressed in prostate cancer. BKCa expression positively correlates with Ki67 index and gleason score of prostate cancer. Upregulation of BKCa promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. On the contrary, downregulation of BKCa inhibited growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the ion-conducting function of BKCa contributed moderately to prostate cancer proliferation and migration, although, this was not the primary mechanism. BKCa action was mainly mediated through forming a functional complex with αvβ3 integrin. The BKCa/αvβ3 integrin complex promoted FAK phosphorylation independent of the channel activity. Overexpression of BKCa enhanced its association with αvβ3 integrin and FAK which increased FAK phosphorylation. Conversely, disrupting the complex by downregulation of BKCa reduced FAK phosphorylation. Finally, blocking of αvβ3 integrin or p-FAK activity using LM609 or Y15 markedly abrogated BKCa-enhanced cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, these results suggest that targeting BKCa/αvβ3/FAK may inaugurate innovative approaches to inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis.""","""['Cheng Du', 'Zhendong Zheng', 'Danqi Li', 'Li Chen', 'Na Li', 'Xiaomin Yi', 'Yang Yang', 'Fang Guo', 'Wenchao Liu', 'Xiaodong Xie', 'Manjiang Xie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Involvement of ROS-alpha v beta 3 integrin-FAK/Pyk2 in the inhibitory effect of melatonin on U251 glioma cell migration and invasion under hypoxia.', 'Yes-mediated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at tyrosine 861 increases metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'CTGF enhances migration and MMP-13 up-regulation via alphavbeta3 integrin, FAK, ERK, and NF-kappaB-dependent pathway in human chondrosarcoma cells.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'Nano-Strategies Targeting the Integrin αvβ3 Network for Cancer Therapy.', 'THSD7A Positivity Predicts Poor Survival and Is Linked to High FAK Expression and FGFR1-Wildtype in Female Patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung.', 'SCARA5 Is Overexpressed in Prostate Cancer and Linked to Poor Prognosis.', 'Insights into the mechanisms governing P01 scorpion toxin effect against U87 glioblastoma cells oncogenesis.', 'Inhibition of Integrin αvβ3-FAK-MAPK signaling constrains the invasion of T-ALL cells.', 'Autophagy, molecular chaperones, and unfolded protein response as promoters of tumor recurrence.']"""

Based on the diversity of cellular processes and diseases resveratrol reportedly affects and benefits, it is likely that the interest in resveratrol will continue, although uncertainty regarding its mechanism in different biological systems remains.We hypothesize that insights on disease-modulatory activities of resveratrol might be gleaned by systematically dissecting the publicly available published data on chemicals and drugs. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by querying DTome (Drug-Target Interactome), a web-based tool containing data compiled from open-source databases including DrugBank, PharmGSK, and Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA). Four direct protein targets (DPT) and 219 DPT-associated genes were identified for resveratrol. The DPT-associated genes were scrutinized by WebGestalt (WEB-based Gene SeT Analysis Toolkit). This enrichment analysis resulted in 10 identified KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. Refined analysis of KEGG pathways showed that 2 - one linked to p53 and a second to prostate cancer - have functional connectivity to resveratrol and its four direct protein targets. These results suggest that a functional activity network (FAN) approach may be considered as a new paradigm for guiding future studies of resveratrol.

Materials and methods:   A solution of 25 mg indocyanine green in 5 ml sterile water was transperineally injected. Pelvic lymph node dissection was started with the indocyanine green stained nodes followed by extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and likelihood ratio of a negative test of indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection.  Results:   A total of 84 patients with a median age of 63.55 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 8.48 ng/ml were included in the study. Of these patients 60.7% had intermediate risk disease and 25% had high or very high risk disease. A median of 7 indocyanine green stained nodes per patient was detected (range 2 to 18) with a median of 22 nodes excised during extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 25 patients, 23 of whom had disease properly classified by indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection. The most frequent location of indocyanine green stained nodes was the proximal internal iliac artery followed by the fossa of Marcille. The negative predictive value was 96.7% and the likelihood ratio of a negative test was 8%. Overall 1,856 nodes were removed and 603 were stained indocyanine green. Pathological examination revealed 82 metastatic nodes, of which 60% were indocyanine green stained. The negative predictive value was 97.4% but the likelihood ratio of a negative test was 58.5%.  Conclusions:   Indocyanine green guided pelvic lymph node dissection correctly staged 97% of cases. However, according to our data it cannot replace extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Nevertheless, its high negative predictive value could allow us to avoid extended pelvic lymph node dissection if we had an accurate intraoperative lymph fluorescent analysis.""","""['Miguel Ramírez-Backhaus', 'Alejandra Mira Moreno', 'Alvaro Gómez Ferrer', 'Ana Calatrava Fons', 'Juan Casanova', 'Eduardo Solsona Narbón', 'Isabel María Ortiz Rodríguez', 'José Rubio Briones']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Fluorescence Guided Targeted Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'A Specific Mapping Study Using Fluorescence Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Patients with Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'Visualisation of the lymph node pathway in real time by laparoscopic radioisotope- and fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in prostate cancer staging.', 'Performance of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence for Detecting Lymph Node Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application.', 'European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) consensus on Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence-guided surgery.', 'The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment.', 'Diagnostic Value of Radio-Guided Sentinel Node Detection in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy with Modified-Extended Lymphadenectomy.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.']"""

However, such microenvironment is not found in the geometric constraints of 2D cell culture systems used in many cancer studies. Prostate cancer research, in particular, suffers from the lack of suitable in vitro models. Here a 3D superporous scaffold is described with thick pore walls in a mechanically stable and robust architecture to support prostate tumor growth. This scaffold is generated from the cryogelation of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate to produce a defined elastic modulus for prostate tumor growth. Lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells show a linear growth over 21 d as multicellular tumor spheroids in such a scaffold with points of attachments to the walls of the scaffold. These LNCaP cells respond to the growth promoting effects of androgens and demonstrate a characteristic cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor and androgen-dependent gene expression. Compared to 2D cell culture, the expression or androgen response of prostate cancer specific genes is greatly enhanced in the LNCaP cells in this system. This scaffold is therefore a powerful tool for prostate cancer studies with unique advantages over 2D cell culture systems.""","""['Bettina Göppert', 'Thomas Sollich', 'Paul Abaffy', 'Angelica Cecilia', 'Jan Heckmann', 'Antje Neeb', 'Anne Bäcker', 'Tilo Baumbach', 'Friederike J Gruhl', 'Andrew C B Cato']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Small""","""['Semi-interpenetrating polymer network cryogels based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and collagen as potential off-the-shelf platforms for cancer cell research.', 'Optimizing structural and mechanical properties of cryogel scaffolds for use in prostate cancer cell culturing.', 'Phenotypic characterization of prostate cancer LNCaP cells cultured within a bioengineered microenvironment.', 'Combined Effect of Cryogel Matrix and Temperature-Reversible Soluble-Insoluble Polymer for the Development of in Vitro Human Liver Tissue.', 'Paracrine interactions between LNCaP prostate cancer cells and bioengineered bone in 3D in vitro culture reflect molecular changes during bone metastasis.', 'Design and Assessment of Biodegradable Macroporous Cryogels as Advanced Tissue Engineering and Drug Carrying Materials.', 'ARv7 Represses Tumor-Suppressor Genes in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A 3D-engineered porous conduit for peripheral nerve repair.']"""

Therefore, cost-effective and portable diagnosis tools that can be used for point-of-care tests (POCT) are highly desirable. In this study, we report a cost-effective, portable capillary-based biosensor for quantitative detection of biomarkers by the naked eye. This capillary-based biosensor was tested by measuring the distance of blue ink movement, which was directly correlated with the oxygen (O2) produced by efficient core-shell Pt@Au nanoparticles (Pt@AuNPs) catalysts decomposed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). By linking the Pt@AuNPs with antibodies, capillary-based biosensor sandwich immunoassays were constructed. The concentrations of the target proteins were positively correlated with the distances of ink movement. To demonstrate their performance, the biosensors were used to detect the cancer biomarker sprostate-specific antigen (PSA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The linear detection range (LDR) of the capillary-based biosensor for detecting PSA was from 0.02 to 2.5ng/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.017ng/mL. LDR of the biosensor for detecting CEA was from 0.063 to 16ng/mL, and the LOD was 0.044ng/mL. For detection of PSA and CEA in clinical serum samples, the detection results of the capillary-based biosensor were well correlate with the results from of chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs).

Such characteristics would be common to tumours that shared risk factors, including the chemical soil composition. The objective of the present study is to assess the association between levels of chromium and arsenic in soil and the cancer mortality. This is an ecological cancer mortality study at municipal level, covering 861,440 cancer deaths in 7917 Spanish mainland towns from 1999 to 2008. Chromium and arsenic topsoil levels (partial extraction) were determined by ICP-MS at 13,317 sampling points. To estimate the effect of these concentrations on mortality, we fitted Besag, York and Mollié models, which included, as explanatory variables, each town's chromium and arsenic soil levels, estimated by kriging. In addition, we also fitted geostatistical-spatial models including sample locations and town centroids (non-aligned data), using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). All results were adjusted for socio-demographic variables and proximity to industrial emissions. The results showed a statistical association in men and women alike, between arsenic soil levels and mortality due to cancers of the stomach, pancreas, lung and brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Among men, an association was observed with cancers of the prostate, buccal cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, colorectal and kidney. Chromium topsoil levels were associated with mortality among women alone, in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, breast and NHL. Our results suggest that chronic exposure arising from low levels of arsenic and chromium in topsoil could be a potential risk factor for developing cancer.""","""['Olivier Núñez', 'Pablo Fernández-Navarro', 'Iván Martín-Méndez', 'Alejandro Bel-Lan', 'Juan F Locutura', 'Gonzalo López-Abente']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Environ Sci Pollut Res Int""","""['Compositional analysis of topsoil metals and its associations with cancer mortality using spatial misaligned data.', 'Association between heavy metal and metalloid levels in topsoil and cancer mortality in Spain.', 'Residential radon and cancer mortality in Galicia, Spain.', 'Distribution of Heavy Metal Pollution in Surface Soil Samples in China: A Graphical Review.', 'Widespread arsenic contamination of soils in residential areas and public spaces: an emerging regulatory or medical crisis?', 'Spatial patterns and the associated factors for breast cancer hospitalization in the rural population of Fujian Province, China.', 'Interaction of Metals, Menopause and COVID-19-A Review of the Literature.', ""Clinicopathological Spectrum of Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: A Tertiary Care Cancer Hospital Study in Pakistan."", 'Systemic Essential Metal and Metalloid Levels in Patients with Benign Breast Disease and Breast Cancer.', 'Trends Analysis of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the National, Regional, and Global Level, 1990-2019: Results From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.']"""

Methods:   Data were extracted from the French national health insurance database (Sniiram) for 2012, using algorithms, 56 groups of diseases and 27 groups of hospital activity were isolated. Standardized morbidity ratio for age and sex (SMR) were used to compare FOT to mainland France.  Results:   Compared with mainland France, people living in the four FOT had high SMR for diabetes care (Guadeloupe 1.9; Martinique 1.7; Guyane 1.9; La Réunion 2.3), dialysis (2.7; 2.4; 3.8; 4.4), stroke (1.2; 1.1; 2.0; 1.5), and hospitalization for infectious diseases (1.9; 2.5; 2.4; 1.4) and obstetrics (1.4; 1.2; 1.9; 1.2). Care for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer were less frequent except for prostate in Martinique and Guadeloupe (2.3). People living in Martinique, Guadeloupe and la Reunion had more frequently care for psychotic disorders (2.0; 1.7; 1.2), dementia (1.1; 1.3; 11), epileptic seizures (1.4; 1.4; 16) and hospitalizations for burns (2.6; 1.7; 2.9). In la Reunion, people had more frequently coronary syndrome (1.3), cardiac heart failure (1.6), chronic respiratory diseases except cystic fibrosis (1.5), drug addiction (1.4) and hospitalizations for cardiovascular catheterization (1.4) and toxicology, poisoning, alcohol (1.7). Other differences were observed by gender: HIV infection, peripheral arterial disease, some chronic inflammatory disease (lupus) were more frequent in women living in Martinique or Guadeloupe, compared to women from mainland France and psychotic disorders for men. From la Reunion, men had more frequently liver and pancreatic diseases and hospitalisation for toxicology, poisoning, alcohol than men from mainland France.

It facilitates the escape of cells from oncogene-induced fail-safe programs (senescence, apoptosis) and their consequent neoplastic transformation. Additionally, it promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the initiation of the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Interestingly, cancer cells recurrently remain dependent on TWIST1 for their survival and/or proliferation, making TWIST1 their Achilles' heel. TWIST1 has been reported to form either homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes mainly in association with the E bHLH class I proteins. These complexes display distinct, sometimes even antagonistic, functions during development and unequal prometastatic functions in prostate cancer cells. Using a tethered dimer strategy, we successively assessed the ability of TWIST1 dimers to cooperate with an activated version of RAS in human mammary epithelial cell transformation, to provide mice with the ability to spontaneously develop breast tumors, and lastly to maintain a senescence program at a latent state in several breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that the TWIST1-E12 complex, unlike the homodimer, is an oncogenic form of TWIST1 in mammary epithelial cells and that efficient binding of both partners is a prerequisite for its activity. The detection of the heterodimer in human premalignant lesions by a proximity ligation assay, at a stage preceding the initiation of the metastatic cascade, is coherent with such an oncogenic function. TWIST1-E protein heterodimeric complexes may thus constitute the main active forms of TWIST1 with regard to senescence inhibition over the time course of breast tumorigenesis.""","""['Laurent Jacqueroud', 'Charlotte Bouard', 'Geoffrey Richard', 'Léa Payen', 'Mojgan Devouassoux-Shisheboran', 'Douglas B Spicer', 'Julie Caramel', 'Guillaume Collin', 'Alain Puisieux', 'Agnès Tissier', 'Stéphane Ansieau']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Induction of EMT by twist proteins as a collateral effect of tumor-promoting inactivation of premature senescence.', 'Inhibition of Twist1-mediated invasion by Chk2 promotes premature senescence in p53-defective cancer cells.', 'EMT inducers catalyze malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells and drive tumorigenesis towards claudin-low tumors in transgenic mice.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'Cellular Senescence in Normal Mammary Gland and Breast Cancer.

Materials and methods:   Ninety-two patients were evaluated prospectively with DCE-MRI at baseline, day 10 during therapy, and 6weeks, 6months and 18months after treatment completion. After motion correction and co-registration to morphological T2-weighted images, tumors and normal appearing contralateral parenchyma (NACP) were segmented manually on T2W images and ROI statistics calculated for pharmacokinetic parameters K(trans), kep and ve using the standard Tofts model.  Results:   The volume transfer constant (K(trans), p<0.001/p=0.010) and the leakage space partial volume (ve, p<0.001/p=0.005) showed a statistically significant increase during therapy with protons and carbon ions, respectively. Parametric increases occurred only in patients naive to antihormonal therapy (AHT), and were maximal 10days after the begining of treatment. The rate constant (kep) showed a significant increase only for proton, but not for carbon irradiation (p=0.021). Statistically significant differences between PC and NACP were observed for all parameters (p<0.001). AHT naïve patients with persistent PSA elevation above 1ng/ml at 12months experienced statistically significant elevation of K(trans) and ve compared to those with PSA suppression (p=0.04/p=0.023).  Conclusion:   DCE parametric changes following ion particle irradiation of the prostate have not been previously reported. Their development into potential non-invasive imaging biomarkers for assessment of treatment response and efficacy is expected to be aided by the data on the magnitude and temporal evolution of parametric responses of cancer and normal tissue during and after therapy presented here, especially the changes of K(trans) and ve during therapy and their different measurement levels within tumors and in normal appearing contralateral tissue.""","""['David Bonekamp', 'Maya B Wolf', 'Christopher Edler', 'Sonja Katayama', 'Heinz-Peter Schlemmer', 'Klaus Herfarth', 'Matthias Röthke']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Diffusion-weighted MRI treatment monitoring of primary hypofractionated proton and carbon ion prostate cancer irradiation using raster scan technique.', 'Monitoring radiotherapy induced tissue changes in localized prostate cancer by multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI).', 'DCE-MRI of the prostate using shutter-speed vs. Tofts model for tumor characterization and assessment of aggressiveness.', 'Clinical applications of proton and carbon ion therapy.', 'DCE MRI of prostate cancer.', 'Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer With Parametrial Invasion on Whole-Tumor Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Combined With Whole-Lesion Texture Analysis Based on T2- Weighted Images.', '4D perfusion CT of prostate cancer for image-guided radiotherapy planning: A proof of concept study.', 'The transformation of radiation oncology using real-time magnetic resonance guidance: A review.']"""

To date, the mortality rate per year for AKI exceeds 50 % at least in patients requiring early renal replacement therapy and is higher than the mortality for breast and prostate cancer, heart failure and diabetes combined.Until now, no effective treatments able to accelerate renal recovery and improve survival post AKI have been developed. In search of innovative and effective strategies to foster the limited regeneration capacity of the kidney, several studies have evaluated the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of different origin as an attractive therapeutic tool. The results obtained in several models of AKI and CKD document that MSCs have therapeutic potential in repair of renal injury, preserving renal function and structure thus prolonging animal survival through differentiation-independent pathways. In this chapter, we have summarized the mechanisms underlying the regenerative processes triggered by MSC treatment, essentially due to their paracrine activity. The capacity of MSC to migrate to the site of injury and to secrete a pool of growth factors and cytokines with anti-inflammatory, mitogenic, and immunomodulatory effects is described. New modalities of cell-to-cell communication via the release of microvesicles and exosomes by MSCs to injured renal cells will also be discussed. The translation of basic experimental data on MSC biology into effective care is still limited to preliminary phase I clinical trials and further studies are needed to definitively assess the efficacy of MSC-based therapy in humans.""","""['Marina Morigi', 'Cinzia Rota', 'Giuseppe Remuzzi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['The effects of glomerular and tubular renal progenitors and derived extracellular vesicles on recovery from acute kidney injury.', 'Cell therapy for kidney injury: different options and mechanisms--mesenchymal and amniotic fluid stem cells.', 'Potential and Therapeutic Efficacy of Cell-based Therapy Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute/chronic Kidney Disease.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells and kidney repair.', 'Gene-modified Mesenchymal Stem Cell-based Therapy in Renal Ischemia- Reperfusion Injury.', 'Reduced inflammation following human endometrial stromal/stem cell injection into male Wistar rats with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.', 'Enhancing the Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Based Therapies with an Anti-Fibrotic Agent for the Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease.', 'Ameliorative effects of miR-186 on cisplatin-triggered acute kidney injury via targeting ZEB1.', 'Harnessing the Physiological Functions of Cellular Prion Protein in the Kidneys: Applications for Treating Renal Diseases.', 'Stem/progenitor cell in kidney: characteristics, homing, coordination, and maintenance.']"""

Objective:   To assess TB in active surveillance (AS).  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively evaluated SB (12-core sector) and TB among 103 AS men undergoing surveillance biopsy, 54 men undergoing confirmatory biopsy (CB), and 73 men referred for diagnostic biopsy (DB; comparison group). Regions of interest (ROIs) on mpMRI were assigned a PI-RADS score and targeted if the score was ≥3.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Detection of Gleason score (GS) ≥7 by TB and SB was the outcome of interest, except in a multivariable model, for which any cancer was the outcome.  Results and limitations:   GS ≥7was detected by either biopsy method in 25 men (24.3%) in the AS group, 12 men (22.2%) in the CB group, and 55 men (75.3%) in the DB group.GS ≥7 was found in 24.3% by SB + TB versus 20.4% by SB in the AS group (p=0.13); in 22.2% by SB + TB versus 16.7% by SB in the CB group (p=0.25); and in 75.3% by SB + TB versus 58.9% by SB in the DB group (p=0.002). The sensitivity for GS ≥7 detection was lower for TB than for SB (p=0.006) in the AS cohort (relative sensitivity ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.71). Higher PI-RADS score (4 vs 3, odds ratio [OR] 2.00, p=0.04; 5 vs 3, OR 4.74, p=0.02), lower MRI-estimated prostate volume (OR 1.20 per 10-cm3 lower volume, p=0.01), larger ROI (OR 1.04 per mm, p=0.02), and right-sided ROI (OR 2.27, p=0.01) were associated with finding cancer on TB. A potential limitation is that not all men who presented for biopsy underwent TB and the urologist was not blinded to MRI results before SB.  Conclusions:   Owing to the low relative sensitivity of mpMRI for detection of GS ≥7 disease, SB still needs to be performed for men on AS.

We estimated the effects of changes in unemployment and PEH on cancer mortality, and identified how universal health coverage (UHC) affected these relationships.  Methods:   For this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the World Bank and WHO (1990-2010). We aggregated mortality data for breast cancer in women, prostate cancer in men, and colorectal cancers in men and women, which are associated with survival rates that exceed 50%, into a treatable cancer class. We likewise aggregated data for lung and pancreatic cancers, which have 5 year survival rates of less than 10%, into an untreatable cancer class. We used multivariable regression analysis, controlling for country-specific demographics and infrastructure, with time-lag analyses and robustness checks to investigate the relationship between unemployment, PEH, and cancer mortality, with and without UHC. We used trend analysis to project mortality rates, on the basis of trends before the sharp unemployment rise that occurred in many countries from 2008 to 2010, and compared them with observed rates.  Results:   Data were available for 75 countries, representing 2.106 billion people, for the unemployment analysis and for 79 countries, representing 2.156 billion people, for the PEH analysis. Unemployment rises were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific cancers except lung cancer in women. By contrast, untreatable cancer mortality was not significantly linked with changes in unemployment. Lag analyses showed significant associations remained 5 years after unemployment increases for the treatable cancer class. Rerunning analyses, while accounting for UHC status, removed the significant associations. All-cancer, treatable cancer, and specific cancer mortalities significantly decreased as PEH increased. Time-series analysis provided an estimate of more than 40,000 excess deaths due to a subset of treatable cancers from 2008 to 2010, on the basis of 2000-07 trends. Most of these deaths were in non-UHC countries.  Interpretation:   Unemployment increases are associated with rises in cancer mortality; UHC seems to protect against this effect. PEH increases are associated with reduced cancer mortality. Access to health care could underlie these associations. We estimate that the 2008-10 economic crisis was associated with about 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development alone.

Our aim was to demonstrate the variability in predictive model accuracy and utility between different populations.  Methods:   Our model is based on 761 men who underwent initial TRUS biopsy at a single institution in Turkey. Patients were included if they had at least 10 cores on biopsy and PSA level <20 ng/ml. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to develop a new nomogram. External validity was tested with two different cohorts one from another institution in Turkey (N = 136) and cohort from USA (N = 2242).  Results:   Prostate cancer (PCa) and high-grade PCa was diagnosed in 249/761 (32.7 %) and 101/761 (13.3 %) patients from Ankara, Turkey, respectively. Predictors of PCa were age (p < 0.0001, OR 2.11), PSA (p = 0.044, OR 1.44), PV (p < 0.0001, OR 0.38), %fPSA (p = 0.016, OR 0.72), and abnormal DRE (p < 0.0001, OR 2.05).

In vivo dosimetry (IVD) is therefore important to ensure patient safety. This study assesses clinical IVD and investigates error detection thresholds for real-time treatment monitoring.  Materials and methods:   IVD was performed for 40 treatments planned using intra-operative trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) with a MOSFET inserted into an additional needle. Post-treatment TRUS images were acquired for 20 patients to assess needle movement. Monte Carlo simulations of treatment plans were performed for 10 patients to assess impact of heterogeneities. Per-needle and total plan uncertainties were estimated and retrospectively applied to the measured data as error detection thresholds.  Results:   The mean measured dose was -6.4% compared to prediction (range +5.1% to -15.2%).

We therefore employed nitroxide-radical containing nanoparticle, termed redox nanoparticle (RNP(N)) which is an effective scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a drug carrier. RNP(N) encapsulation increased pioglitazone solubility, thus increasing cellular uptake of encapsulated pioglitazone which reduced the dose required to induce toxicity in prostate cancer cell lines. Investigation of in vitro molecular mechanism of pioglitazone revealed that both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were involved in tumor cell death. In addition, intravenously administered pioglitazone-loaded RNP(N) produced significant tumor volume reduction in vivo due to enhanced permeation and retention effect. Most importantly, oxidative damage caused by pioglitazone in the liver was significantly suppressed by pioglitazone-loaded RNP(N) due to the presence of nitroxide radicals. It is interesting to note that oral administration of encapsulated pioglitazone, and co-administration of RNP(N) and pioglitazone, i.e., no encapsulation of pioglitazone in RNP(N) also significantly contributed to suppression of the liver injury. Therefore, use of RNP(N) either as an adjuvant or as a carrier for drugs with severe side effects is a promising chemotherapeutic strategy.""","""['Sindhu Thangavel', 'Toru Yoshitomi', 'Meena Kishore Sakharkar', 'Yukio Nagasaki']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Redox nanoparticles inhibit curcumin oxidative degradation and enhance its therapeutic effect on prostate cancer.', 'Reactive oxygen species-scavenging nanomedicines for the treatment of oxidative stress injuries.', 'Development of an oral nanotherapeutics using redox nanoparticles for treatment of colitis-associated colon cancer.', 'Nitroxide radicals and nanoparticles: a partnership for nanomedicine radical delivery.', ""Neuroprotective Role of Nanoparticles Against Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Harnessing reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and inflammation: Nanodrugs for liver injury.', 'Newly Developed Self-Assembling Antioxidants as Potential Therapeutics for the Cancers.', 'Artesunate-Loaded and Near-Infrared Dye-Conjugated Albumin Nanoparticles as High-Efficiency Tumor-Targeted Photo-Chemo Theranostic Agent.', 'Human Skin Permeation Studies with PPARγ Agonist to Improve Its Permeability and Efficacy in Inflammatory Processes.', 'Rationalization of a nanoparticle-based nicotine nanovaccine as an effective next-generation nicotine vaccine: A focus on hapten localization.']"""

Materials and methods:   3T MR images of 68 patients with 85 cancer suspicious lesions were analyzed. The findings were correlated with histopathology. T2w imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE), and MR-Spectroscopy (MRS) were acquired. Every lesion was given a single PI-RADS score for each parameter, as well as a sum score and a PI-RADS v2 score. Furthermore, T2-morphology, ADC-value, perfusion type, citrate/choline-level, and localization were evaluated.  Results:   44 of 85 lesions showed PCa (51.8%), 21 chronic prostatitis (24.7%), and 20 other benign tissue such as hyperplasia or fibromuscular tissue (23.5%). The single PI-RADS score for T2WI, DWI, DCE, as well as the aggregated score including and not including MRS, and the PI-RADS v2-score were all significantly higher for PCa than for prostatitis or other tissue (p<0.001). The single PI-RADS score for MRS and the PI-RADS sum score including MRS were significantly higher for prostatitis than for other tissue (p=0.029 and p=0.020), whereas the other parameters were not different. Prostatitis usually presented borderline pathological PI-RADS scores, showed restricted diffusion with ADC≥900mm(2)/s in 100% of cases, was more often indistinctly hypointense on T2WI (66.7%), and localized in the transitional zone (57.1%). An ADC≥900mm(2)/s achieved the highest predictive value for prostatitis (AUC=0.859).  Conclusion:   Prostatitis can be differentiated from PCa using PI-RADS, since all available parameters are more distinct in cases of cancer. However, there is significant overlap between prostatitis and other benign findings, thus PI-RADS is only suitable to a limited extent for the primary assessment of prostatitis. Restricted diffusion with ADC≥900mm(2)/s is believed to be a good indicator for prostatitis. MRS can help to distinguish between prostatitis and other tissue.""","""['Michael Meier-Schroers', 'Guido Kukuk', 'Karsten Wolter', 'Georges Decker', 'Stefan Fischer', 'Christian Marx', 'Frank Traeber', 'Alois Martin Sprinkart', 'Wolfgang Block', 'Hans Heinz Schild', 'Winfried Willinek']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Clinically insignificant prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance according to Prostate Cancer Research International: Active surveillance criteria: Utility of PI-RADS v2.', 'Evaluation of the prostate imaging reporting and data system for the detection of prostate cancer by the results of targeted biopsy of the prostate.', 'MR-sequences for prostate cancer diagnostics: validation based on the PI-RADS scoring system and targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'PI-RADS Version 2: A Pictorial Update.', 'The Application of Biopsy Density in Transperineal Templated-Guided Biopsy Patients With PI-RADS<3.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging: state of the art and applications in whole-body imaging.', 'Impact of Chronic Prostatitis on the PI-RADS Score 3: Proposal for the Addition of a Novel Binary Suffix.', 'Value of PI-RADS v2 scores combined with prostate specific antigen in diagnosis of peripheral zone prostate cancer: a logistic regression analysis.', 'Differentiation Diagnosis of Hypo-Intense T2 Area in Unilateral Peripheral Zone of Prostate Using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS): Prostate Carcinoma versus Prostatitis.']"""

Phytochemicals in Rhoeo discolor (R. discolor) extracts have proven to have important cancer cell specific cytotoxic activity. In the present research, we determined the cytotoxic effect of extracts of R. discolor, a plant commonly used in Mexico for both medicinal and ornamental purposes.  Aim of the study:   We evaluated the cytotoxic effects against three representative human cancer cell lines: HT-29 colon cancer, Hep-G2 liver cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines, as well as a control fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3.  Materials and methods:   Ten different crude extracts were tested along with fractions derived from the five most bioactive crude extracts. Analytical data, HPLC-MS-TOF, revealed a high content of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, ferulic, vanillic, chlorogenic and p-coumaric acid in the extracts. Phenolic compounds have previously been reported as health beneficial with antioxidant and potential cancer specific cytotoxic effects.  Results:   Studies revealed that low concentrations of these crude bioactive extracts (10µg/ml) and their fractions (50µg/ml) were effective as cancer specific cytotoxic agents, since they caused a significant proliferation inhibition on cancer cell lines (up to 94.2% in HT-29, 92.9% in Hep-G2 and 61.8% in PC-3 of apoptosis induction) with little harm to the control cell line (no higher than 28.3% apoptosis induction), and, importantly, the most effective extracts were mainly water, methanol and ethanol based.

Advanced PCa, especially castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), is difficult to cure. There is an urgent need to develop novel agents for CPRC. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin and is a well-known antimalarial drug. DHA has been documented to be a potential anticancer agent for PCa. However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of DHA are still unknown.  Main methods:   Proteomics analysis based on iTRAQ technology was performed to determine the protein profile changes in human prostate cancer PC3 cells treated by DHA, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy.  Key findings:   DHA induced obvious apoptosis in PC3 cells. Using iTRAQ technology, we found 86 differentially expressed proteins linked to the cytotoxicity of DHA in PC3 cells. Gene ontology analysis showed the differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with the protein synthesis and translation. Protein interaction network analysis and KEGG pathway analysis revealed altered aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. Moreover, one candidate protein, heat shock protein HSP70 (HSPA1A), was identified by western blot analysis.  Significance:   Our results indicate that multiple mechanisms involved in the anticancer activity of DHA in PC3 cells. Decreased HSP70 expression may have an important role in DHA-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells.

We hypothesized that type VIII collagen was upregulated in diseases associated with vascular remodeling, e.g. pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. In this paper we present the development and validation of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting type VIII collagen in serum and plasma.  Design and methods:   A monoclonal antibody was raised against the C-terminal of type VIII collagen (C8-C) and a competitive ELISA was developed.

Dogs spontaneously develop tumours, and they are considered a good model for comparative oncology initiatives. Due to the limited information on these proteins in canine tumours, this study aimed to investigate gene and protein alterations in PTEN, AR, MDM2 and p53 in canine prostate cancer (PC). Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (15 normal, 22 proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) and 19 PC samples) and Western blotting (2 normal prostate tissue, 2 BPH, 2 PIA samples and 2 PC samples) and gene expression by RT-qPCR (10 normal, 10 PIA and 15 PC samples) of formalin-fixed tissue. We identified nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of PTEN and p53 in all samples, with only nuclear staining found for MDM2 and AR. Our results revealed high expression of MDM2 in PC and PIA samples compared to normal samples, whereas PTEN, P53 and AR expression was down-regulated in PC compared to normal tissue. All tumour samples (n=19) showed loss of nuclear PTEN expression, and all cancer mimickers showed positive nuclear staining. Therefore, nuclear PTEN staining could be a good diagnostic marker for differentiating between malignant lesions and mimickers.

This study investigates the prognostic impact of estrogen receptor (ER) α and β and the aromatase (AR) enzyme in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Tumor tissue from 335 NSCLC patients was collected and tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to evaluate the expression of ERα, ERβ and AR in the cytoplasme and nuclei of cells in the tumor epithelial and stromal compartment. By use of survival statistics we investigated the markers impact on disease-specific survival (DSS). Nuclear ERβ expression in tumor epithelial cells in female patients (HR 3.03; 95% CI 1.39-6.61) and tumor cell AR expression in all patients (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.08-2.23) were significant negative prognostic markers of disease-specific survival in our cohort. High ERβ expression correlates with worse outcome in female patients. Further, patients with high AR expression had an unfavorable prognostic outcome compared with patients expressing low AR levels. These results emphasize the importance of sex steroids role in NSCLC, and, as anti-hormonal drugs are widely available, could lead to the development of novel palliative or even adjuvant treatment strategies in this patient population.""","""['Kaja Skjefstad', 'Thea Grindstad', 'Mehrdad Rakaee Khanehkenari', 'Elin Richardsen', 'Tom Donnem', 'Thomas Kilvaer', 'Sigve Andersen', 'Roy M Bremnes', 'Lill-Tove Busund', 'Samer Al-Saad']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Corrigendum to ""Prognostic relevance of estrogen receptor α, β and aromatase expression in non-small cell lung cancer"" Steroids 113 (2016) 5-13.', 'Expression levels of estrogen receptor beta in conjunction with aromatase predict survival in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Co-expression of estrogen receptor beta and aromatase in Japanese lung cancer patients: gender-dependent clinical outcome.', 'Steroid receptor and growth factor receptor expression in human nonsmall cell lung cancers using cells procured by laser-capture microdissection.', 'Estrogen receptor beta as a prognostic factor in breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Estrogen receptor expression in tumors different from breast cancer.', 'New Perspectives on Sex Steroid Hormones Signaling in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Estrogens, Cancer and Immunity.', 'Endogenous sex hormones, aromatase activity and lung cancer risk in postmenopausal never-smoking women.', 'Estradiol-mediated inhibition of Sp1 decreases miR-3194-5p expression to enhance CD44 expression during lung cancer progression.', 'Targeting Estrogens and Various Estrogen-Related Receptors against Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers: A Perspective.']"""

However, most Enz therapy eventually fails with the development of Enz resistance. The detailed mechanisms how CRPC develops Enz resistance remain unclear and may involve multiple mechanisms. Among them, the induction of the androgen receptor (AR) mutant AR-F876L in some CRPC patients may represent one driving force that confers Enz resistance. Here, we demonstrate that the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9(®), not only degrades wild-type AR, but also has the ability to target AR-F876L. The consequence of suppressing AR-F876L may then abrogate AR-F876L mediated CRPC cell proliferation and metastasis.

Src, which signals through FAK in response to integrin activation, has been implicated in many aspects of tumor biology, such as cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, Src signaling is known to crosstalk with IGF-IR, which also promotes angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that c-Src, IGF-IR, and FAK are packaged into exosomes (Exo), c-Src in particular being highly enriched in Exo from the androgen receptor (AR)-positive cell line C4-2B and AR-negative cell lines PC3 and DU145. Furthermore, we show that the active phosphorylated form of Src (SrcpY416 ) is co-expressed in Exo with phosphorylated FAK (FAKpY861 ), a known target site of Src, which enhances proliferation and migration. We further demonstrate for the first time exosomal enrichment of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 5 and GRK6, both of which regulate Src and IGF-IR signaling and have been implicated in cancer. Finally, SrcpY416 and c-Src are both expressed in Exo isolated from the plasma of prostate tumor-bearing TRAMP mice, and those same mice have higher levels of exosomal c-Src than their wild-type counterparts. In summary, we provide new evidence that active signaling molecules relevant to PrCa are enriched in Exo, and this suggests that the Src signaling network may provide useful biomarkers detectable by liquid biopsy, and may contribute to PrCa progression via Exo.

In patients with end-stage renal failure, renal transplantation improves both quality of life and life expectancy. The current literature indicates that the numbers of renal recipients over 60 years of age has increased in recent years.  Objectives:   To evaluate the prevalence and management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) in a contemporary series of male renal transplant (RTx) recipients.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 150 consecutive transplant recipients at the University of Jena 12 months postoperatively for the presence and treatment of LUTS related to BPO.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 59 years (range 27 - 82 years). By 12 months postoperatively, 91% (n = 137/150) were off dialysis with a functioning kidney graft. Two patients died during follow up. Six patients had undergone treatment for prostate cancer prior to RTx. Of the remaining 131 patients, 47% (n = 62/131) were considered as patients with BPO 12 months after RTx. Six percent (n = 8/131) of the patients experienced urinary retention due to BPO and 6% (n = 8/131) had a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) during the first year after RTx. No major complications were observed in those patients. A significant increase was noted in the use of α-blocker therapy after RTx (P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   We observed a high prevalence of LUTS related to BPO in our cohort of patients. Due to the increasing age of transplant recipients, more attention should be paid to the evaluation and treatment of BPO prior to RTx.""","""['Bjorn Ergesi', 'Yvonne Winkler', 'Thomas Kistler', 'Marc-Oliver Grimm', 'Hubert John', 'Marcus Horstmann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nephrourol Mon""","""['Transurethral resection of the prostate in kidney transplant recipients: urological and renal functional outcomes at long-term follow-up.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) requiring transurethral resection in freshly transplanted renal allograft recipients.', 'Debilitating lower urinary tract symptoms in the post-renal transplant population can be predicted pretransplantation.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Preservation of sexual function when relieving benign prostatic obstruction surgically: can a trade-off be considered?', 'Patients with renal transplant and moderate-to-severe LUTS benefit from urodynamic evaluation and early transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'The outcomes of transurethral incision/resection of the prostate (TUIP/TURP) performed early after renal transplantation.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the effect of partial-volume correction (PVC) combined with several VOI methods on the accuracy and precision of quantitative PET.  Methods:   Four image-based PVC methods and resolution modeling (applied as PVC) were used in combination with several common VOI methods. Performance was evaluated using simulations, phantom experiments, and clinical repeatability studies. Simulations were based on a whole-body 18F-FDG PET scan in which differently sized spheres were placed in lung and mediastinum. A National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU2 quality phantom was used for the experiments. Repeatability data consisted of an 18F-FDG PET/CT study on 11 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and an 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT study on 12 patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Results:   Phantom data demonstrated that most PVC methods were strongly affected by the applied resolution kernel, with accuracy differing by about 20%-50% between full-width-at-half-maximum settings of 5.0 and 7.5 mm. For all PVC methods, large differences in accuracy were seen among all VOI methods. Additionally, the image-based PVC methods were observed to have variable sensitivity to the accuracy of the VOI methods. For most PVC methods, accuracy was strongly affected by more than a 2.5-mm misalignment of true (simulated) VOI. When the optimal VOI method for each PVC method was used, high accuracy could be achieved. For example, resolution modeling for mediastinal lesions and iterative deconvolution for lung lesions were 99% ± 1.5% and 99% ± 0.9% accurate, respectively, for spheres 15-40 mm in diameter. Precision worsened slightly for resolution modeling and to a larger extent for some image-based PVC methods. Uncertainties in delineation propagated into uncertainties in PVC performance, as confirmed by the clinical data.  Conclusion:   The accuracy and precision of the tested PVC methods depended strongly on VOI method, resolution settings, contrast, and spatial alignment of the VOI. PVC has the potential to substantially improve the accuracy of tracer uptake assessment, provided that robust and accurate VOI methods become available. Commonly used delineation methods may not be adequate for this purpose.""","""['Matthijs C F Cysouw', 'Gerbrand Maria Kramer', 'Otto S Hoekstra', 'Virginie Frings', 'Adrianus Johannes de Langen', 'Egbert F Smit', 'Alfons J M van den Eertwegh', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager', 'Ronald Boellaard']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Partial volume correction strategies for quantitative FDG PET in oncology.', 'Subcentimeter tumor lesion delineation for high-resolution 18F-FDG PET images: optimizing correction for partial-volume effects.', '18F-FDG-PET partial volume effect correction using a modified recovery coefficient approach based on functional volume and local contrast: physical validation and clinical feasibility in oncology.', 'Impact of partial-volume correction in oncological PET studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Partial Volume Correction Strategies in PET.', 'Multiparametric Dual-Time-Point 18FFDG PET/MRI for Lymph Node Staging in Patients with Untreated FIGO I/II Cervical Carcinoma.', 'Yield of FDG PET/CT for Defining the Extent of Disease in Patients with Kaposi Sarcoma.', 'Phantom Validation of a Conservation of Activity-Based Partial Volume Correction Method for Arterial Input Function in Dynamic PET Imaging.', '18F-FDG-PET/CT in radiation therapy-induced parotid gland inflammation.', 'Feasibility of Different Tumor Delineation Approaches for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT Imaging in Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

We developed a urea-based, 211At-labeled small molecule targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the treatment of micrometastases due to prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   PSMA-targeted (2S)-2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-(4-211At-astatobenzamido)pentyl)ureido)-pentanedioic acid (211At- 6: ) was synthesized. Cellular uptake and clonogenic survival were tested in PSMA-positive (PSMA+) PC3 PIP and PSMA-negative (PSMA-) PC3 flu human PC cells after 211At- 6: treatment. The antitumor efficacy of 211At- 6: was evaluated in mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu flank xenografts at a 740-kBq dose and in mice bearing PSMA+, luciferase-expressing PC3-ML micrometastases. Biodistribution was determined in mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu flank xenografts. Suborgan distribution was evaluated using α-camera images, and microscale dosimetry was modeled. Long-term toxicity was assessed in mice for 12 mo.  Results: 211At- 6: treatment resulted in PSMA-specific cellular uptake and decreased clonogenic survival in PSMA+ PC3 PIP cells and caused significant tumor growth delay in PSMA+ PC3 PIP flank tumors. Significantly improved survival was achieved in the newly developed PSMA+ micrometastatic PC model. Biodistribution showed uptake of 211At- 6: in PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors and in kidneys. Microscale kidney dosimetry based on α-camera images and a nephron model revealed hot spots in the proximal renal tubules. Long-term toxicity studies confirmed that the dose-limiting toxicity was late radiation nephropathy.  Conclusion:   PSMA-targeted 211At- 6: α-particle radiotherapy yielded significantly improved survival in mice bearing PC micrometastases after systemic administration. 211At- 6: also showed uptake in renal proximal tubules resulting in late nephrotoxicity, highlighting the importance of long-term toxicity studies and microscale dosimetry.""","""['Ana P Kiess', 'Il Minn', 'Ganesan Vaidyanathan', 'Robert F Hobbs', 'Anders Josefsson', 'Colette Shen', 'Mary Brummet', 'Ying Chen', 'Jaeyeon Choi', 'Eftychia Koumarianou', 'Kwamena Baidoo', 'Martin W Brechbiel', 'Ronnie C Mease', 'George Sgouros', 'Michael R Zalutsky', 'Martin G Pomper']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Auger Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid, 18FDCFPyL, a PSMA-based PET imaging agent for prostate cancer.', 'Auger radiopharmaceutical therapy targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen in a micrometastatic model of prostate cancer.', 'Glu-Ureido-Based Inhibitors of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen: Lessons Learned During the Development of a Novel Class of Low-Molecular-Weight Theranostic Radiotracers.', '123I-Labeled (S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-(3-(4-iodophenyl) ureido)pentyl)ureido)pentanedoic acid.', 'Selective ablation of TRA-1-60+ pluripotent stem cells suppresses tumor growth of prostate cancer.', 'Astatine-211 based radionuclide therapy: Current clinical trial landscape.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?', 'Targeted α-therapy using astatine (211At)-labeled PSMA1, 5, and 6: a preclinical evaluation as a novel compound.', 'A Review on Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Preclinical Dosimetry in Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT).']"""

With 5550 participants, this was by far the largest European congress concerning nuclear medicine. More than 1750 scientific presentations were submitted, with more than 250 abstracts from young scientists, indicating that the future success of our discipline is fuelled by a high number of young individuals becoming involved in a multitude of scientific activities. Significant improvements have been made in molecular imaging of cancer, particularly in prostate cancer. PSMA-directed PET/CT appears to become a new gold standard for staging and restaging purposes. Novel tumour specific compounds have shown their potential for target identification also in other solid neoplasms and further our understanding of tumour biology and heterogeneity. In addition, a variety of nuclear imaging techniques guiding surgical interventions have been introduced. A particular focus of the congress was put on targeted, radionuclide based therapies. Novel theranostic concepts addressing also tumour entities with high incidence rates such as prostate cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, have shown effective anti-tumour activity. Strategies have been presented to improve further already established therapeutic regimens such as somatostatin receptor based radio receptor therapy for treating advanced neuroendocrine tumours. Significant contributions were presented also in the neurosciences track. An increasing number of target structures of high interest in neurology and psychiatry are now available for PET and SPECT imaging, facilitating specific imaging of different subtypes of dementia and movement disorders as well as neuroinflammation. Major contributions in the cardiovascular track focused on further optimization of cardiac perfusion imaging by reducing radiation exposure, reducing scanning time, and improving motion correction. Besides coronary artery disease, many contributions focused on cardiac inflammation, cardiac sarcoidosis, and specific imaging of large vessel vasculitis. The physics and instrumentation track included many highlights such as novel, high resolution scanners. The most noteworthy news and developments of this meeting were summarized in the highlights lecture. Only 55 scientific contributions were mentioned, and hence they represent only a brief summary, which is outlined in this article.

The lymphatic growth of cancer has been used as a significant independent adverse prognostic factor and provides information about tumor progression. Salivary gland tumors present different prognoses and have the ability to develop metastases; however, this information regarding the lymphatic spread is scarce. This paper quantifies the lymphatic microvessel density (LMD) in benign and malignant salivary gland tumors and analyzes the relationship between LMD and tumor expression of vascular endothelial growth factors C (VEGF-C) and the proliferative index. The results show that there is no correlation between LMD, VEGF-C and the proliferative index in the majority of salivary gland tumors analyzed, apart from polymorphous low-grade carcinoma which exhibits statistical correlation between LMD and the proliferative index (p < 0.05). This correlation probably does not indicate a poor prognosis for this PLGA, since this is a low metastasizing carcinoma of the salivary glands. Different from other solid tumors, such as breast or prostatic carcinomas, there is no correlation between VEGF-C and LMD in salivary gland tumors, and so these traits are not able to estimate the metastatic risk or the prognosis of these tumors.""","""['Márcia Gimenes Americo', 'Yonara Maria Freire Soares Marques', 'Milagros Del Valle El Abras Ankha', 'Renata Falchete do Prado', 'Yasmin Rodarte Carvalho']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Mol Morphol""","""['Analyses of VEGFC/VEGF-D expressions, density and endothelial lymphatic proliferation in salivary gland neoplasms.', 'Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in mucoepidermoid carcinoma of minor salivary glands.', 'Lymphatic vessel density and expressions of lymphangiogenic growth factors in salivary carcinomas.', 'Molecular control of lymphatic metastasis.', 'Autophagy and salivary gland cancer: A putative target for salivary gland tumors.']"""

Risk group-adapted treatment and avoidance of unnecessary toxicities relies primarily on accurate tumor staging. Thus, the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in diagnosis and treatment of PC is a highly interesting development in radiation oncology of urologic tumors. The present work is to evaluate the integration of (68)Ga-PSMA-PET imaging into standard radiation planning of primary definitive treatment of PC and to determine the impact of PSMA imaging on tumor staging.  Methods:   The data of 15 patients treated for PC between August 2013 and April 2015 were evaluated. Treatment planning included (68)Ga-PSMA-PET imaging. We analyzed whether the use of PSMA-imaging led to a change of the TNM stage and if it influenced the RT treatment approach or the target volume, due to changes in the gross tumor volume (GTV) or clinical target volume (CTV), in the final treatment plan.  Results:   In 53.3 % of the analyzed patients a change occurred in the TNM stage based on (68)Ga-PSMA-PET examination. The RT concept changed in 33.3 % of all patients, leading to relevant changes in the planning target volume. Among these, an additional irradiation of the pelvic lymph drainage due to tracer uptake in lymph nodes was performed in 25 %. Furthermore, boost volumes of PET-positive lymph nodes were added in 80 % of these cases. A down staging due to the (68)Ga-PSMA-PET examination occurred in 13.3 % of all cases.  Conclusions:   The integration of (68)Ga-PSMA-PET-imaging into the RT treatment planning process can be useful for detailed target volume planning. The performance of a (68)Ga-PSMA-PET frequently leads to changes in the TNM stage, altering the RT treatment regimen and the target volume.

Materials and methods:   The first part of the study was conducted in 11 patients aging 54 to 76 years old with cancer of the kidney, bladder, or prostate in stages III-IV of the disease. The second part of the study was conducted in four patients aged 60-82 years old, who were given from 4 to 7 transfusions of mononuclear fraction of peripheral blood from young donors 19-23 years old, with the same sex and blood types as the recipients, in order to restore cell regeneration.  Results:   In the first part of the study, 1 month after chemotherapy or targeted therapy, all 11 cancer patients had leukopenia accompanied by an increase in the contents of FGFb in the blood by 1.74 times on average. Four of these patients had an increase in the level of human VEGF-A of 1.25 times on average, while three patients had an increase in the level of human EGF of 1.13 times on average. In the second part of the study, 3-6 months after the completion of a cycle of 4-7 blood transfusions of mononuclear fraction of periphery blood, four patients had an in increase in the contents of hematopoietic progenitor cells CD34+ of periphery blood by 3.25 times on average, to the level normal in young people, while the level of FGFb decreased by 1.78 times on average. Among two patients, the level of human VEGF-A decreased by 1.48 times on average, while for three patients the level of human EGF decreased by 4.12 times on average.
