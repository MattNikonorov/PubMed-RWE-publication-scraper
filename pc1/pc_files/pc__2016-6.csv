However, the connections between mtDNA depletion and metabolism reprograming-based cancer cell stemness in prostate cancers are still lack of studies. Here, we demonstrated that human CRPC cell line PC3 tolerated high concentration of the mtDNA replication inhibitor ethidium bromide (EtBr) and the mtDNA depletion triggered a universal metabolic remodeling process. Failure in completing that process caused lethal consequences. The mtDNA depleted (MtDP) PC3 cells could be steadily maintained in the special medium in slow cycling status. The MtDP PC3 cells contained immature mitochondria and exhibited Warburg effect. Furthermore, the MtDP PC3 cells were resistant to therapeutic treatments and contained greater cancer stem cell-like subpopulations: CD44+, ABCG2+, side-population and ALDHbright. In conclusion, these results highlight the association of mtDNA content, mitochondrial function and cancer cell stemness features.""","""['Xiaoran Li', 'Yali Zhong', 'Jie Lu', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Lars Eide', 'Randi G Syljuåsen', 'Qian Peng', 'Junbai Wang', 'Hongquan Zhang', 'Mariusz Adam Goscinski', 'Gunnar Kvalheim', 'Jahn M Nesland', 'Zhenhe Suo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Correction: MtDNA depleted PC3 cells exhibit Warburg effect and cancer stem cell features.', 'Blocking mtDNA replication upregulates the expression of stemness-related genes in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'MtDNA depletion influences the transition of CD44 subtypes in human prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'Different Effects of BORIS/CTCFL on Stemness Gene Expression, Sphere Formation and Cell Survival in Epithelial Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Expansion and characterization of cancer stem-like cells in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.', 'Expression of breast cancer resistance protein and p-glycoprotein in residual breast cancer tissue after chemotherapy and its correlation with cancer stem cells.', 'Strategies for understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of lung cancer: a cell model for chronic exposure to cigarette smoke extract.', 'Gemcitabine Resistance in Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma Cell Lines Stems from Reprogramming of Energy Metabolism.', 'A high-resolution route map reveals distinct stages of chondrocyte dedifferentiation for cartilage regeneration.', 'UBQLN1 mediates sorafenib resistance through regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS homeostasis by targeting PGC1β in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'DNAJA3/Tid1 Is Required for Mitochondrial DNA Maintenance and Regulates Migration and Invasion of Human Gastric Cancer Cells.']"""

It is overexpressed in many types of tumors and associated with proliferation, migration, and invasion; however, its function in human prostate cancer is unresolved. Our objective was to determine its effects and the underlying pathways of S100A16 in prostate cancer tissues and cells. We measured S100A16 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase and Western blotting in eight matched prostate cancer and adjacent normal tissues, and in three prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145, LNCaP, and PC-3, compared to a normal prostate epithelial cell line PrEC. DU-145 cells stably overexpressing S100A16 and PC-3 cells with S100A16 knockdown were established by transfection with S100A16 overexpression plasmid or shRNAs. Invasion, migration, and proliferation were analyzed by transwell assay, wound healing, and colony formation assays, respectively. Western blotting and invasion assays were performed to determine expressions and activation of AKT, ERK, p21, and p27. S100A16 was significantly overexpressed in both prostate cancer tissues and cells lines compared to normal controls (P < 0.05). Overexpression of S100A16 significantly promoted invasion, migration, and proliferation in prostate cancer cells in vitro, whereas silencing S100A16 showed the converse effects (P < 0.05). Furthermore, overexpression of S100A16 activated cell signaling proteins AKT and ERK and downregulated tumor suppressors p21 and p27. Specific inhibitors, LY294002 and PD98059, suppressed activation of AKT and ERK, which attenuated DU-145 cell clone formation and invasion induced by S100A16 overexpression. S100A16 may promote human prostate cancer progression via signaling pathways involving AKT, ERK, p21, and p27 downstream effectors. Our findings suggest that S100A16 may serve as a novel therapeutic or diagnostic target in human prostate cancer.""","""['Weidong Zhu', 'Yi Xue', 'Chao Liang', 'Rihua Zhang', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Hongyan Li', 'Dongming Su', 'Xiubin Liang', 'Yuanyuan Zhang', 'Qiong Huang', 'Menglan Liu', 'Lu Li', 'Dong Li', 'Allan Z Zhao', 'Yun Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'S100A16 promotes metastasis and progression of pancreatic cancer through FGF19-mediated AKT and ERK1/2 pathways.', 'S100A16 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells in part via the JNK/p38 MAPK pathway.', 'Cell-to-cell contact-mediated regulation of tumor behavior in the tumor microenvironment.', 'New progress with calcium-binding protein S100A16 in digestive system disease.', 'An Update on S100A16 in Human Cancer.', 'An integrated bioinformatics analysis of the S100 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Dialog beyond the Grave: Necrosis in the Tumor Microenvironment and Its Contribution to Tumor Growth.', 'RAGE Inhibitors for Targeted Therapy of Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Identification and validation of a hypoxia-immune signature for overall survival prediction in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

We hypothesized that delays in surgery due to initial surveillance would not impact surgical pathological outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective cohort study of 2 groups of patients with NCCN low risk prostate cancer from practices in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative, that is 1) men who chose initial active surveillance and went on to delayed prostatectomy and 2) men who chose immediate prostatectomy. Diagnoses occurred from January 2011 through August 2015. For these 2 groups we compared radical prostatectomy Gleason scores, and rates of extraprostatic disease, positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastases.  Results:   During a median followup of 506 days 79 (6%) of 1,359 low risk men choosing initial surveillance transitioned to prostatectomy. Compared to those treated with immediate prostatectomy (778), men undergoing delayed surgery were more likely to have Gleason score 7 or greater disease (69.2% vs 48.8%, respectively, p=0.004), but were no more likely to have positive margins, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases.  Conclusions:   Patients with low risk prostate cancer who enter active surveillance have higher grade disease at prostatectomy compared to those undergoing immediate surgery. However, the lack of difference in other adverse pathological outcomes suggests preservation of the window of curability.""","""['Gregory B Auffenberg', 'Susan Linsell', 'Apoorv Dhir', 'Stacie N Myers', 'Bradley Rosenberg', 'David C Miller;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Does Time Spent on Active Surveillance Adversely Affect the Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Delayed Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Surgical management after active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: pathological outcomes compared with men undergoing immediate treatment.', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer outcomes at an uro-oncology referral center.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer : An update.', 'Optimizing Time to Treatment to Achieve Durable Biochemical Disease Control after Surgery in Prostate Cancer: A Multi-Institutional Cohort Study.', '18F-Positron Emitting/Trimethine Cyanine-Fluorescent Contrast for Image-Guided Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Management and outcomes of Gleason six prostate cancer detected on needle biopsy: A single-surgeon experience over 6\xa0years.']"""

Although important for determining the most suitable treatment and optimal management strategy for patients, staging continues to present significant challenges to clinicians. Clinical test results such as the pre-treatment Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level, the biopsy most common tumor pattern (Primary Gleason pattern) and the second most common tumor pattern (Secondary Gleason pattern) in tissue biopsies, and the clinical T stage can be used by clinicians to predict the pathological stage of cancer. However, not every patient will return abnormal results in all tests. This significantly influences the capacity to effectively predict the stage of prostate cancer. Herein we have developed a neuro-fuzzy computational intelligence model for classifying and predicting the likelihood of a patient having Organ-Confined Disease (OCD) or Extra-Prostatic Disease (ED) using a prostate cancer patient dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. The system input consisted of the following variables: Primary and Secondary Gleason biopsy patterns, PSA levels, age at diagnosis, and clinical T stage. The performance of the neuro-fuzzy system was compared to other computational intelligence based approaches, namely the Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, Support Vector Machine, the Naive Bayes classifiers, and also the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram which is commonly used by clinicians. A comparison of the optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) points that were identified using these approaches, revealed that the neuro-fuzzy system, at its optimal point, returns the largest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), with a low number of false positives (FPR = 0.274, TPR = 0.789, AUC = 0.812). The proposed approach is also an improvement over the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram (FPR = 0.032, TPR = 0.197, AUC = 0.582).""","""['Georgina Cosma', 'Giovanni Acampora', 'David Brown', 'Robert C Rees', 'Masood Khan', 'A Graham Pockley']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Machine learning for improved pathological staging of prostate cancer: a performance comparison on a range of classifiers.', 'An artificial neural network for prostate cancer staging when serum prostate specific antigen is 10 ng./ml. or less.', 'Prediction of pathological stage in patients with clinical stage T1c prostate cancer: the new challenge.', 'The comparability of models for predicting the risk of a positive prostate biopsy with prostate-specific antigen alone: a systematic review.', 'Nonpalpable stage T1c prostate cancer: prediction of insignificant disease using free/total prostate specific antigen levels and needle biopsy findings.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis of validated and circulating miRNAs in ovarian cancer.', 'Dr. Answer AI for prostate cancer: Intention to use, expected effects, performance, and concerns of urologists.', 'PCSK9 Axis-Targeting Pseurotin A as a Novel Prostate Cancer Recurrence Suppressor Lead.', 'Association between preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels and mortality in high- and intermediate-grade prostate cancer patients who received radical prostatectomy: Findings from the SEER database.', 'A systematic review of the applications of Expert Systems (ES) and machine learning (ML) in clinical urology.']"""

The study analyzed a closed cohort comprised of Israelis aged 21-89 years, enrolled in a health fund, and followed from 2002 to 2012. Adjusting for age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, we calculated hazard ratios for cancer incidence using Cox regression separately for participants with prevalent and incident diabetes; the latter was further divided by time since diabetes diagnosis. Of the 2,186,196 individuals included in the analysis, 159,104 were classified as having prevalent diabetes, 408,243 as having incident diabetes, and 1,618,849 as free of diabetes. In both men and women, diabetes posed an increased risk of cancers of the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, endometrium, stomach, kidney, brain (benign), brain (malignant), colon/rectum, lung (all, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), ovary, and bladder, as well as leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. No excess risk was observed for breast cancer in premenopausal women or for thyroid cancer. Diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Hazard ratios for all-site and site-specific cancers were particularly elevated during the first year following diabetes diagnosis. The findings of this large study with a time-dependent approach are consistent with those of previous studies that have observed associations between diabetes and cancer incidence.""","""['Rachel Dankner', 'Paolo Boffetta', 'Ran D Balicer', 'Lital Keinan Boker', 'Maya Sadeh', 'Alla Berlin', 'Liraz Olmer', 'Margalit Goldfracht', 'Laurence S Freedman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Epidemiol""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Metformin Treatment and Cancer Risk: Cox Regression Analysis, With Time-Dependent Covariates, of 320,000 Persons With Incident Diabetes Mellitus.', 'Cancer risk among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: disentangling true associations, detection bias, and reverse causation.', 'Diabetes mellitus and cancer risk: review of the epidemiological evidence.', 'Effect of smoking, hypertension and lifestyle factors on kidney cancer - perspectives for prevention and screening programmes.', 'Primary and Immortalized Cultures of Human Proximal Tubule Cells Possess Both Progenitor and Non-Progenitor Cells That Can Impact Experimental Results.', 'Simplifying the B Complex: How Vitamins B6 and B9 Modulate One Carbon Metabolism in Cancer and Beyond.', 'Different types of diabetes mellitus and risk of thyroid cancer: A meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Glycemic index, glycemic load, and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies.']"""

However, AS is not widely utilized, partially due to psychological and decision-making factors associated with treatment preferences.  Methods:   In a longitudinal cohort study, we conducted pretreatment telephone interviews (N = 1,140, 69.3% participation) with newly diagnosed, low-risk prostate cancer patients (PSA ≤ 10, Gleason ≤ 6) from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We assessed psychological and decision-making variables, and treatment preference [AS, AT, and No Preference (NP)].  Results:   Men were 61.5 (SD, 7.3) years old, 24 days (median) after diagnosis, and 81.1% white. Treatment preferences were: 39.3% AS, 30.9% AT, and 29.7% NP. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that men preferring AS (vs. AT) were older (OR, 1.64; CI, 1.07-2.51), more educated (OR, 2.05; CI, 1.12-3.74), had greater prostate cancer knowledge (OR, 1.77; CI, 1.43-2.18) and greater awareness of having low-risk cancer (OR, 3.97; CI, 1.96-8.06), but also were less certain about their treatment preference (OR, 0.57; CI, 0.41-0.8), had greater prostate cancer anxiety (OR, 1.22; CI, 1.003-1.48), and preferred a shared treatment decision (OR, 2.34; CI, 1.37-3.99). Similarly, men preferring NP (vs. AT) were less certain about treatment preference, preferred a shared decision, and had greater knowledge.  Conclusions:   Although a substantial proportion of men preferred AS, this was associated with anxiety and uncertainty, suggesting that this may be a difficult choice.  Impact:   Increasing the appropriate use of AS for low-risk prostate cancer will require additional reassurance and information, and reaching men almost immediately after diagnosis while the decision-making is ongoing.

We demonstrate that it is feasible to routinely image the full prostate circumference, generating gigapixel panorama images of the surface that are readily interpreted by pathologists. VR-SIM confirmed detection of positive surgical margins in 3 out of 4 prostates with pathology-confirmed adenocarcinoma at the circumferential surgical margin, and furthermore detected extensive residual cancer at the circumferential margin in a case post-operatively classified by histopathology as having negative surgical margins.

Often, tumor extends close to the posterior margin, where it is controversial whether pathologists should measure the distance between the tumor and the margin. There are no published data regarding the significance of a close margin factoring in the anatomical location within the radical prostatectomy (RP). We identified 158 RPs with 39 anterior-predominant carcinomas and 119 cases with posterior-predominant cancer. Distances between the tumor and inked margin were measured with an ocular micrometer. Eighty-seven cases had no progression with a minimum 6-year follow-up (median, 8; range, 6-9). Eighteen cases had progression with a median time to progression of 2 years with all men progressing within 6 years after RP. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of progression relative to distance of tumor to the posterior margin (P=.09). The mean distance of tumor to the anterior margin for the cases that progressed was 0.6 mm (median, 0.5 mm; range, 0.05-1.18) compared to 1.9 mm (median, 1.1; range, 0.02-4) for the cases that did not progress (P=.02). Of 7 cases with anterior-predominant tumors that progressed, 5 had tumor located less than 1 mm from the anterior margin. In conclusion, if cancer is present less than 1 mm from the anterior margin, there is an increased tendency to recur, and this finding should be included in pathology reports.

Materials and methods:   Within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified patients treated with PCNL between 1998 and 2010 for kidney stones. We examined the temporal trends in PCNL use and charges among obese and nonobese patients. We then tested the effect of obesity on perioperative complications, transfusions, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges (THCs). LOS and THCs were defined as a continuous variable and were also dichotomized according to the 75th percentile into prolonged LOS (pLOS) and increased THCs (iTHCs). Then, multivariable models were fitted.  Results:   Overall, a weighted sample of 90,529 individuals treated with PCNL between 1998 and 2010 was examined. Of those patients, 9300 were obese (10.3%). The proportion of PCNLs performed in obese patients increased throughout the years from 7.4% to 16.7% (p < 0.001). Overall complication rates were 21.6% vs 22.0% (p = 0.3) and transfusion rates were 4.3% vs 4.0% (p = 0.1) for obese and nonobese patients, respectively. Obese patients had fewer genitourinary complications (13.4% vs 15.0%, p < 0.001), but had higher rates of sepsis (1.7% vs 1.3%, p = 0.009) as well as respiratory (3.0% vs 2.5%, p = 0.002) and vascular complications (0.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.007). Conversely, pLOS (20.9% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001) and iTHCs (30.8% vs 24.4%, p < 0.001) were more frequently recorded in obese patients. In multivariable analyses, obesity was neither associated with higher rates of overall complications (odds ratio [OR], p = 0.3) nor with higher rates of transfusions (p = 0.3). However, obesity was associated with pLOS (OR: 1.21, p = 0.002) as well as iTHCs (OR: 1.17, p = 0.002).

Other cancer types such as glioblastoma and thyroid carcinoma show very few alterations in any of the 47 autophagy genes. Overall, individual autophagy core genes are altered at low frequency in cancer, suggesting that cancer cells require functional autophagy.

Materials and methods:   Perioperative blood samples from prostate cancer (PC) patients who underwent total gland cryoablation between October 2011 and March 2013 were collected prospectively. Plasma TGF-β1 levels were quantified using magnetic bead immunoassay. The perioperative change in TGF-β1 was defined as the change in TGF-β1 from before surgery to 1-2 months after surgery. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined according to the Phoenix criteria. The Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum, and Chi-square test were used to compare the clinical characteristics of the subsets. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for the comparison of recurrence risk among the groups.  Results:   A total of 75 PC patients were included. During a median follow-up period of 12 months (range: 2.5-47 months), 11 patients had BCR, and 64 patients did not. Significantly greater changes in the perioperative TGF-β1 levels (median: 470.3 vs. 78.9 pg/ml) were observed in patients with than without BCR (p < 0.05). According to the changes in TGF-β1 levels, the patients were further divided into 4 groups, which were determined in the quartile categories of perioperative TGF-β1 levels. Group 4 (≥430) predicted the worst BCR outcome.  Conclusions:   Perioperative plasma TGF-β1 levels were associated with BCR after prostate cryoablation for localized PC. Increase in postoperative plasma TGF-β1 may be a novel predictor for poor oncological outcomes and prompt a more aggressive follow-up or earlier salvage treatment.""","""['Alexander Sheng-Shin Wang', 'Chung-Hsin Chen', 'Yu-Ting Chou', 'Yeong-Shiau Pu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cryobiology""","""['Predictors of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation.', 'Prognostic value of saturated prostate cryoablation for localized prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative plasma levels of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) strongly predict progression in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'A prospective DE-MRI study evaluating the role of TGF-β1 in left atrial fibrosis and implications for outcomes of cryoballoon-based catheter ablation: new insights into primary fibrotic atriocardiomyopathy.', 'Comparisons of Oncological and Functional Outcomes Between Primary Whole-Gland Cryoablation and High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Thrombin contributes to cancer immune evasion via proteolysis of platelet-bound GARP to activate LTGF-β.']"""

In contrast, the histological changes of low-grade urothelial carcinomas in this kind of biopsy have not been studied.  Materials and methods:   We describe the clinicopathologic features of two patients with low-grade bladder carcinomas infiltrating the prostate. They reported dysuria and hematuria. Both had a slight elevation of the prostate specific antigen and induration of the prostatic lobes. Needle biopsies were performed. At endoscopy bladder tumors were found in both cases.  Results:   Both biopsies showed nests of basophilic cells and cells with perinuclear clearing and slight atypia infiltrating acini and small prostatic ducts. The stroma exhibited extensive desmoplasia and chronic inflammation. The original diagnosis was basal cell hyperplasia and transitional metaplasia. The bladder tumors also showed low-grade urothelial carcinoma. In one case, the neoplasm infiltrated the lamina propria, and in another, the muscle layer. In both, a transurethral resection was performed for obstructive urinary symptoms. The neoplasms were positive for high molecular weight keratin (34BetaE12) and thrombomodulin. No metastases were found in either of the patients, and one of them has survived for five years.  Conclusions:   The diagnosis of low-grade urothelial carcinoma in prostate needle biopsies is difficult and may simulate benign prostate lesions including basal cell hyperplasia and urothelial metaplasia. It is crucial to recognize low-grade urothelial carcinoma in needle biopsies because only an early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve the prognosis for these patients.""","""['Julian Arista-Nasr', 'Braulio Martinez-Benitez', 'Leticia Bornstein-Quevedo', 'Elizmara Aguilar-Ayala', 'Claudia Natalia Aleman-Sanchez', 'Raul Ortiz-Bautista']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Pseudopapillary features in prostatic adenocarcinoma mimicking urothelial carcinoma: a diagnostic pitfall.', 'Urothelial hyperplastic lesion with endophytic growth pattern: a clinicopathologic study.', 'Noninvasive squamous lesions in the urinary bladder: a clinicopathologic analysis of 29 cases.', 'Urachal carcinomas of the nonglandular type: salient features and considerations in pathologic diagnosis.', 'Urothelial carcinoma in the prostatic urethra and prostate: current controversies.']"""

Patients and methods:   Data on resource use and quality of life for 707 patients collected prospectively in the TRAPEZE 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial (ISRCTN 12808747) were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of i) zoledronic acid versus no zoledronic acid (ZA vs. no ZA), and ii) strontium-89 versus no strontium-89 (Sr89 vs. no Sr89). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK and included expenditures for trial treatments, concomitant medications, and use of related hospital and primary care services. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated according to patients' responses to the generic EuroQol EQ-5D-3L instrument, which evaluates health status. Results are expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.  Results:   The per-patient cost for ZA was £12 667, £251 higher than the equivalent cost in the no ZA group. Patients in the ZA group had on average 0.03 QALYs more than their counterparts in no ZA group. The ICER for this comparison was £8 005. Sr89 was associated with a cost of £13 230, £1365 higher than no Sr89, and a gain of 0.08 QALYs compared to no Sr89. The ICER for Sr89 was £16 884. The probabilities of ZA and Sr89 being cost-effective were 0.64 and 0.60, respectively.  Conclusions:   The addition of bone-targeting treatments to standard chemotherapy led to a small improvement in QALYs for a modest increase in cost (or cost-savings).

In this study we aimed to address whether the AR coactivator nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) is involved in PCa progression. Therefore, we tested the effect of long-term NCOA1 knockdown on processes relevant to metastasis formation. [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assays revealed a reduced proliferation rate in AR-positive MDA PCa 2b and LNCaP cells upon knockdown of NCOA1, whereas AR-negative PC3 cells were not affected. Furthermore, Boyden chamber assays showed a strong decrease in migration and invasion upon NCOA1 knockdown, independently of the cell line's AR status. In order to understand the mechanistic reasons for these changes, transcriptome analysis using cDNA microarrays was performed. Protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) was found to be prominently up-regulated by NCOA1 knockdown in MDA PCa 2b, but not in PC3 cells. Inhibition of PRKD1 reverted the reduced migratory potential caused by NCOA1 knockdown. Furthermore, PRKD1 was negatively regulated by AR. Immunohistochemical staining of PCa patient samples revealed a strong increase in NCOA1 expression in primary tumors compared with normal prostate tissue, while no final conclusion could be drawn for PRKD1 expression in tumor specimens. Thus, our findings directly associate the AR/NCOA1 complex with PRKD1 regulation and cellular migration and support the concept of therapeutic inhibition of NCOA1 in PCa.""","""['Birgit Luef', 'Florian Handle', 'Gvantsa Kharaishvili', 'Martina Hager', 'Johannes Rainer', 'Günter Janetschek', 'Stephan Hruby', 'Christine Englberger', 'Jan Bouchal', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Androgen Triggers the Pro-Migratory CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis in AR-Positive Breast Cancer Cell Lines: Underlying Mechanism and Possible Implications for the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors in Breast Cancer.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Elevation of androgen receptor promotes prostate cancer metastasis by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduction of KAT5.', 'Expression and function of androgen receptor coactivators in prostate cancer.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'High expression of ladinin-1 (LAD1) predicts adverse outcomes: a new candidate docetaxel resistance gene for prostatic cancer (PCa).', 'Preclinical Models in Prostate Cancer: Resistance to AR Targeting Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-dependent phosphorylation and phospho-proteome targets in prostate cancer.', 'Protein kinase D1 induces G1-phase cell-cycle arrest independent of Checkpoint kinases by phosphorylating Cell Division Cycle Phosphatase 25.', 'The oncogenic roles of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 in human esophageal carcinoma.']"""

Patients undergoing salvage surgery after failure of chemotherapy ± radiotherapy and follow-up >5 years were considered for study. Variables related to the patient, to treatment, and to the surgical specimen were compared using the log-rank test in patients who achieved and failed to achieve 5-year progression-free survival (5-yr PFS). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for significant variables.  Results:   Of the 108 patients enrolled in the protocols, 33 (30.6%) underwent salvage surgery and 26 matched study criteria. Seventeen patients were disease-free after a median follow-up of 125 months (range 65.5-311.7 months), 5-yr PFS 65.4%. Nine events were registered after a median follow-up of 5.4 months (range 1.9-27.5 months). Among the variables assessed (Table), only an undifferentiated histology proved to be significantly associated with a poorer 5-yr PFS, whereas a tumor size above 5 cm in the removed specimen approached significance. The OR (95% CI) for failure of 5-yr PFS was 28 (2.4-326.8) and 8.3 (1.03-67.1), respectively.  Conclusion:   5-yr PFS proved unrelated to excision margins of the surgical specimen, that is on whether there was evidence of microscopic residues left behind during surgery. These data suggest that the outcome is more influenced by the biological properties of the tumor. If small foci of differentiated cells are left behind, these probably do not compromise final prognosis. In our patients requiring salvage bladder-prostate surgery after failure of chemotherapy ± radiotherapy, long-term progression-free survival seemed unrelated to patient/tumor characteristics at presentation and preoperative management. Regarding the characteristics of the removed specimen, instead, an undifferentiated tumor histology and a diameter of the removed tumor >5 cm negatively influenced prognosis, whereas the presence of positive excision margins did not.""","""['Lorenzo Angelini', 'Gianni Bisogno', 'Rita Alaggio', 'Giovanni Scarzello', 'Luisa Santoro', 'Ilaria Zanetti', 'Angela Scagnellato', 'Eleonora Basso', ""Paolo D'Angelo"", 'Andrea Ferrari', 'Marco Castagnetti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pediatr Urol""","""['Radical surgery and different types of urinary diversion in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma of bladder or prostate--a single institution experience.', 'Brachytherapy Combined With Surgery for Conservative Treatment of Children With Bladder Neck and/or Prostate Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Conservative approach in localised rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate: results from International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) studies: malignant mesenchymal tumour (MMT) 84, 89 and 95.', 'The role of surgery in the management of pediatric pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Conservative treatment of bladder and prostatic rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood: possibilities for non-radical surgery.', 'Management of Refractory Pediatric Sarcoma: Current Challenges and Future Prospects.', 'Appraisal of the role of radical prostatectomy for rhabdomyosarcoma in children: oncological and urological outcome.']"""

To promote patient-centeredness and motivate quality improvement, payers have begun tying reimbursement with related measures of patient experience. Accordingly, the authors sought to determine whether such data correlate with outcomes among patients undergoing surgery for genitourinary cancer.  Methods:   The authors used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) data from 2009 through 2011. They identified hospital admissions for cancer-directed prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy, and measured mortality, hospitalization length, discharge disposition, and complications. Mixed effects models were used to compare the likelihood of selected outcomes between the top and bottom tercile hospitals adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.  Results:   Among a sample of 46,988 encounters, the authors found small differences in patient age, race, income, comorbidity, cancer type, receipt of minimally invasive surgery, and procedure acuity according to HCAHPS tercile (P<.001). Hospital characteristics also varied with respect to ownership, teaching status, size, and location (P<.001). Compared with patients treated in low-performing hospitals, patients treated in high-performing hospitals less often faced prolonged hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.92) or nursing-sensitive complications (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.99). No difference was found with regard to inpatient mortality, other complications, and discharge disposition (P>.05).  Conclusions:   Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample and HCAHPS data, the authors found a limited association between patient experience and surgical outcomes. For urologic cancer surgery, patient experience may be optimally viewed as an independent quality domain rather than a mechanism with which to improve surgical outcomes.

In this study, we showed that the expression levels of MUTYH mRNA and protein were significantly lower in prostate cancer than in non-cancerous prostatic tissue by examining two independent, publicly available databases and by performing an immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer specimens obtained at our hospital, respectively. About two-thirds of the prostate cancers exhibited a reduced MUTYH expression. When the effect of reduced MUTYH expression in prostate adenocarcinoma on the somatic mutation load was examined using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the numbers of total somatic mutations and somatic G:C to T:A mutations were significantly higher in the reduced MUTYH expression group than in the other group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0013, respectively).

In addition, current treatment patterns for the most prevalent cancer types are presented based on information in the National Cancer Data Base and treatment-related side effects are briefly described. More than 15.5 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2016, and this number is projected to reach more than 20 million by January 1, 2026. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,306,760), colon and rectum (724,690), and melanoma (614,460) among males and breast (3,560,570), uterine corpus (757,190), and colon and rectum (727,350) among females. More than one-half (56%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and almost one-half (47%) are aged 70 years or older. People with a history of cancer have unique medical and psychosocial needs that require proactive assessment and management by primary care providers.

High concentrations of butyrate (>1.5mM) have been shown to activate apoptosis in several cancer cell lines including prostate, breast, and leukemia. Butyrate is also known to influence multiple signaling pathways that are mediators of cytokine production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of high concentrations of butyrate on the cancer microenvironment vis-à-vis apoptosis, cellular migration, and capacity to modulate cytokine expression in cancer cells. The results indicate that high concentrations of butyrate induced a 2-fold activation of caspase-3 and reduced cell viability by 60% in U937 leukemia cells. Within 24h, butyrate significantly decreased the levels of chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 in HL-60 and U937 cells, and decreased CCL5 in THP-1 leukemia cells. Differential effects were observed in treatments with valproic acid for CCL2 and CCL5 indicating butyrate-specificity. Many of the biological effects examined in this study are linked to activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathways; therefore, we investigated whether butyrate alters the levels of phosphorylated forms of these signaling proteins and how it correlated with the expression of chemokines. The results show that butyrate may partially regulate CCL5 production via p38 MAPK. The decrease in p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT levels correlated with the decrease in CCL2 production. These data suggest that while promoting apoptosis, butyrate has the potential to influence the cancer microenvironment by inducing differential expression of cytokines.""","""['Stephanie R Pulliam', 'Samuel T Pellom Jr', 'Anil Shanker', 'Samuel E Adunyah']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Valproic acid and butyrate induce apoptosis in human cancer cells through inhibition of gene expression of Akt/protein kinase B.', 'Coadministration of histone deacetylase inhibitors and perifosine synergistically induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells through Akt and ERK1/2 inactivation and the generation of ceramide and reactive oxygen species.', 'Naja nigricollis CMS-9 enhances the mitochondria-mediated death pathway in adaphostin-treated human leukaemia U937 cells.', 'Active lipids of Ganoderma lucidum spores-induced apoptosis in human leukemia THP-1 cells via MAPK and PI3K pathways.', 'Chemokines in human obesity.', 'Prevention and Health Benefits of Prebiotics, Probiotics and Postbiotics in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.', 'Brain-immune interaction mechanisms: Implications for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.', 'Identification of Potential Novel Prognosis-Related Genes Through Transcriptome Sequencing, Bioinformatics Analysis, and Clinical Validation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'In situ delivery of biobutyrate by probiotic Escherichia coli for cancer therapy.', 'RNA sequencing reveals niche gene expression effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate in primary myotubes.']"""

While high levels of c-MYC expression are sufficient for cell cycle re-entry, the modality to block c-MYC expression, and subsequent cell cycle re-entry, is limited. Using reversible quiescence rendered by serum withdrawal or contact inhibition in PTEN(null)/p53(WT) (LNCaP) or PTEN(null)/p53(mut) (PC-3) prostate cancer cells, we have identified a compound that is able to impede cell cycle re-entry through c-MYC. Guttiferone K (GUTK) blocked resumption of DNA synthesis and preserved the cell cycle phase characteristics of quiescent cells after release from the quiescence. In vehicle-treated cells, there was a rapid increase in c-MYC protein levels upon release from the quiescence. However, this increase was inhibited in the presence of GUTK with an associated acceleration in c-MYC protein degradation. The inhibitory effect of GUTK on cell cycle re-entry was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing c-MYC. The protein level of FBXW7, a subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for degradation of c-MYC, was reduced upon the release from the quiescence. In contrast, GUTK stabilized FBXW7 protein levels during release from the quiescence. The critical role of FBXW7 was confirmed using siRNA knockdown, which impaired the inhibitory effect of GUTK on c-MYC protein levels and cell cycle re-entry. Administration of GUTK, either in vitro prior to transplantation or in vivo, suppressed the growth of quiescent prostate cancer cell xenografts. Furthermore, elevation of FBXW7 protein levels and reduction of c-MYC protein levels were found in the xenografts of GUTK-treated compared with vehicle-treated mice. Hence, we have identified a compound that is capable of impeding cell cycle re-entry by quiescent PTEN(null)/p53(WT) and PTEN(null)/p53(mut) prostate cancer cells likely by promoting c-MYC protein degradation through stabilization of FBXW7. Its usage as a clinical modality to prevent prostate cancer progression should be further evaluated.""","""['Z Xi', 'M Yao', 'Y Li', 'C Xie', 'J Holst', 'T Liu', 'S Cai', 'Y Lao', 'H Tan', 'H-X Xu', 'Q Dong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Triggering Fbw7-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-Myc by oridonin induces cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.', 'Recombinant human adenovirus-p53 injection induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines mediated by p53-Fbxw7 pathway, which controls c-Myc and cyclin E.', 'MYC is a critical target of FBXW7.', 'Regulation mechanism of Fbxw7-related signaling pathways\xa0(Review).', 'Emerging roles for the FBXW7 ubiquitin ligase in leukemia and beyond.', 'Quiescent Cancer Cells-A Potential Therapeutic Target to Overcome Tumor Resistance and Relapse.', 'Apigenin impedes cell cycle progression at G2 phase in prostate cancer cells.', 'OMICS Applications for Medicinal Plants in Gastrointestinal Cancers: Current Advancements and Future Perspectives.', 'Nujiangexanthone A Inhibits Cervical Cancer Cell Proliferation by Promoting Mitophagy.', 'Towards a Framework for Better Understanding of Quiescent Cancer Cells.']"""

Advances will depend in part on the development of clinically relevant and reliable animal models. This report describes the engineering and validation of a humanized tissue-engineered bone organ (hTEBO) for preclinical research on primary bone tumors in order to minimize false-positive and false-negative results due to interspecies differences in current xenograft models.  Methods:   Pelvic bone and marrow fragments were harvested from patients during reaming of the acetabulum during hip arthroplasty. HTEBOs were engineered by embedding fragments in a fibrin matrix containing bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) and implanted into NOD-scid mice. After 10 weeks of subcutaneous growth, one group of hTEBOs was harvested to analyze the degree of humanization. A second group was injected with human luciferase-labeled OS (Luc-SAOS-2) cells. Tumor growth was followed in vivo with bioluminescence imaging. After 5 weeks, the OS tumors were harvested and analyzed. They were also compared with tumors created via intratibial injection.  Results:   After 10 weeks of in vivo growth, a new bone organ containing human bone matrix as well as viable and functional human hematopoietic cells developed. Five weeks after injection of Luc-SAOS-2 cells into this humanized bone microenvironment, spontaneous metastatic spread to the lung was evident. Relevant prognostic markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and periostin were found to be positive in OS tumors grown within the humanized microenvironment but not in tumors created in murine tibial bones. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-2α (HIF-2α) was detected only in the humanized OS.  Conclusions:   We report an in vivo model that contains human bone matrix and marrow components in one organ.

Many studies show no difference in prognosis between substages, and incidence of pT2b prostate cancer is low. Other classification systems have been proposed based on tumor volume, as measured by dominant nodule size or tumor percentage. We characterized pT2b tumors and assessed the utility of current pT2 substaging in predicting biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy and compared them with different substaging methods based on tumor volume. Patients with pT2 tumors were selected among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 1998 to 2008. Dominant nodule size was dichotomized as <1.6 cm versus ≥1.6 cm. Tumor percentage was dichotomized as ≤25% versus >25%. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate pathological parameters predictive of biochemical recurrence-free survival. Of 785 patients who met criteria, 145 (18.5%) were pT2a, 15 (1.9%) were pT2b, and 625 (79.6%) were pT2c. The pT2 substages were not significant predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival on univariate or multivariate analysis. In a multivariate model, tumor percentage >25% (P=.002) was associated with decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival. In patients with stage pT2 prostate cancer, the current substaging method lacks predictive value for biochemical recurrence-free survival after accounting for other pathologic and clinical predictors.

For each RTR in radical prostatectomy (RP) subset, we included 4 non-organ transplant patients who underwent RP by the same surgeons, and compared pre-operative and post-operative oncological features, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate.  Results:   Twenty-four RTR were included (PCa incidence 1.5%). Mean follow-up was 47 months. PCa was mostly localized (n=21, 87.5%) with treatments including RP (n=16, 76.2%), brachytherapy (n=3, 14.3%), radiation therapy (n=1, 4.7%), and active surveillance (n=1, 4.7%). No graft loss due to PCa treatment was reported. Nineteen RTR with localized PCa (90.5%) were free from BCR. Considering RP subset, no difference in PCa characteristics at diagnosis and BCR rate was found between RTR (n=16) and control patients (n=64).

Prior reports show that the quantitative signal derived from RSI-MRI, the cellularity index, is associated with aggressive prostate cancer as measured by Gleason grade (GG). We evaluated the reliability of RSI-MRI to predict variance with GG at the voxel-level within clinically demarcated prostate cancer regions.  Experimental design:   Ten cases were processed using whole mount sectioning after radical prostatectomy. Regions of tumor were identified by an uropathologist. Stained prostate sections were scanned at high resolution (75 μm/pixel). A grid of tiles corresponding to voxel dimensions was graded using the GG system. RSI-MRI cellularity index was calculated from presurgical prostate MR scans and presented as normalized z-score maps. In total, 2,795 tiles were analyzed and compared with RSI-MRI cellularity.  Results:   RSI-MRI cellularity index was found to distinguish between prostate cancer and benign tumor (t = 25.48, P < 0.00001). Significant differences were also found between benign tissue and prostate cancer classified as low-grade (GG = 3; t = 11.56, P < 0.001) or high-grade (GG ≥ 4; t = 24.03, P < 0.001). Furthermore, RSI-MRI differentiated between low and high-grade prostate cancer (t = 3.23; P = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Building on our previous findings of correlation between GG and the RSI-MRI among whole tumors, our current study reveals a similar correlation at voxel resolution within tumors. Because it can detect variations in tumor grade with voxel-level precision, RSI-MRI may become an option for planning targeted procedures where identifying the area with the most aggressive disease is important.

Methods and materials:   The current series of SHARP included six patients with localized prostate cancer treated with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions by Cyber-knife. Non-coplanar conformal fields and daily stereotactic localization of implanted fiducials were used for treatment. Acute and Late Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were evaluated by Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values and self-reported sexual function were recorded at 3 months interval at first two years then every 6 months thereafter.  Results:   The median follow-up is 32 months. Acute toxicity Grade 1 (GU) noted in four cases and two cases were Grade II; Grade I (GI) was in five cases and one patient in Grade II; also with regards to late toxicity, Grade 1 (GU) and (GI) was present in all cases. No patient has experienced grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicity. Regarding sexual activity, three patients reported impotency before and after therapy and all of them have insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease; fourth patient has developed impotence and the other two patients developed no changes as before radiation.

We know little about subjective work outcomes and how cancer survivors perceive being returned to work. Therefore, we developed the Quality of Working Life Questionnaire for Cancer Survivors (QWLQ-CS). Our aim was to pre-test the items of the initial QWLQ-CS on acceptability and comprehensiveness. In addition, item retention was performed by pre-assessing the relevance scores and response distributions of the items in the QWLQ-CS.  Methods:   Semi-structured interviews were conducted after cancer survivors, who had returned to work, filled in the 102 items of the QWLQ-CS. To improve acceptability and comprehensiveness, the semi-structured interview inquired about items that were annoying, difficult, confusing, twofold or redundant. If cancer survivors had difficulty explaining their opinion or emotion about an item, the interviewer used verbal probing technique to investigate the cancer survivor's underlying thoughts. The cancer survivors' comments on the items were analysed, and items were revised accordingly. Decisions on item retention regarding the relevance of items and the response distributions were made by means of pre-set decision rules.  Results:   The 19 cancer survivors (53 % male) had a mean age of 51 ± 11 years old. They were diagnosed between 2009 and 2013 with lymphoma, leukaemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, or colon cancer. Acceptability of the QWLQ-CS was good - none of the items were annoying - but 73 items were considered difficult, confusing, twofold or redundant. To improve acceptability, for instance, the authors replaced the phrase 'disease' with 'health situation' in several items. Consequently, comprehensiveness was improved by the authors rephrasing and adjusting items by adding clarifying words, such as 'in the work situation'. The pre-assessment of the relevance scores resulted in a sufficient number of cancer survivors indicating the items as relevant to their quality of working life, and no evident indication for uneven response distributions. Therefore, all items were retained.  Conclusions:   The 104 items of the preliminary QWLQ-CS were found relevant, acceptable and comprehensible by cancer survivors who have returned to work. The QWLQ-CS is now suitable for larger sample sizes of cancer survivors, which is necessary to test the psychometric properties of this questionnaire.""","""['Merel de Jong', 'Sietske J Tamminga', 'Angela G E M de Boer', 'Monique H W Frings-Dresen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['The quality of working life questionnaire for cancer survivors (QWLQ-CS): factorial structure, internal consistency, construct validity and reproducibility.', 'Quality of working life of cancer survivors: development of a cancer-specific questionnaire.', 'The Successful Return-To-Work Questionnaire for Cancer Survivors (I-RTW_CS): Development, Validity and Reproducibility.', 'Measuring quality of life in cancer survivors: a methodological review of existing scales.', 'Measuring the psychosocial health of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors: a critical review.', 'Quality of working life can protect against cognitive and emotional vulnerability in women living with metastatic breast cancer: a cross-sectional study.', 'Work ability and quality of working life in atopic dermatitis patients treated with dupilumab.', 'Patient understanding of two commonly used patient reported outcome measures for primary care: a cognitive interview study.', 'The quality of working life questionnaire for cancer survivors (QWLQ-CS): factorial structure, internal consistency, construct validity and reproducibility.', 'Quality of Working Life of cancer survivors: associations with health- and work-related variables.']"""

Today, one of the most pressing questions in prostate cancer medicine is how can screening be honed to identify those who have life-threatening disease and need aggressive treatment. A number of efforts are underway. One such effort is the assessment of men in the landmark Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial that has led to a prostate cancer risk calculator (PCPTRC), which is available online. PCPTRC version 2.0 predicts the probability of the diagnosis of no cancer, low-grade cancer, or high-grade cancer when variables such as PSA, age, race, family history, and physical findings are input. Modern biomarker development promises to provide tests with fewer false positives and improved ability to find high-grade cancers. Stockholm III (STHLM3) is a prospective, population-based, paired, screen-positive, prostate cancer diagnostic study assessing a combination of plasma protein biomarkers along with age, family history, previous biopsy, and prostate examination for prediction of prostate cancer. Multiparametric MRI incorporates anatomic and functional imaging to better characterize and predict future behavior of tumors within the prostate. After diagnosis of cancer, several genomic tests promise to better distinguish the cancers that need treatment versus those that need observation. Although the new technologies are promising, there is an urgent need for evaluation of these new tests in high-quality, large population-based studies.

This work has served as a framework for several ongoing clinical studies focused on bringing novel observations into the clinic in the form of tissue, liquid, and imaging biomarkers. Resistance in CRPC typically is driven through reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which can occur through AR-activating point mutations, amplification, splice variants (such as AR-V7), or other bypass mechanisms. Detection of AR aberrations in the circulation negatively impacts response to subsequent AR-directed therapies such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. Other potentially clinically relevant alterations in CRPC include defects in DNA damage repair (at either the somatic or germline level) in up to 20% of patients (with implications for PARP1 inhibitor therapy), PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway activation, WNT signaling pathway alterations, cell cycle gene alterations, and less common but potentially targetable alterations involving RAF and FGFR2. Imaging biomarkers that include those focused on incorporating overexpressed androgen-regulated genes/proteins, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in combination with CT, can noninvasively identify patterns of AR-driven distribution of CRPC tumor cells, monitor early metastatic lesions, and potentially capture heterogeneity of response to AR-directed therapies and other therapeutics.

It has been proposed that patients with oligometastases may have a more indolent course and that outcome may be further improved with metastasis-directed local ablative therapy. In addition, there are differing schools of thoughts regarding whether oligometastases represent isolated lesions-where targeted therapy may render a patient disease free-or whether they coexist with micrometastases, where targeted therapy in addition to systemic therapy is required for maximal clinical impact. As such, the approach to the patient with oligometastatic prostate cancer requires multidisciplinary consideration, with surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy potentially of benefit either singularly or in combination. Indeed, mounting evidence suggests durable disease-free intervals and, in some cases, possibly cure, may be achieved with such a multimodal strategy. However, selecting patients that may benefit most from treatment of oligometastases is an ongoing challenge. Moreover, with the advent of new, highly sensitive imaging technologies, the spectrum based on CT of the abdomen and pelvis and technetium bone scan of localized to oligometastatic to widespread disease has become increasingly blurred. As such, new MRI- and PET-based modalities require validation. As some clinical guidelines advise against routine prostate-specific antigen screening, the possibility of more men presenting with locally advanced or de novo oligometastatic prostate cancer exists; thus, knowing how best to treat these patients may become more relevant at a population level. Ultimately, the arrival of prospective clinical data and better understanding of biology will hopefully further inform how best to treat men with this disease.""","""['Brandon Bernard', 'Boris Gershman', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book""","""['Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Benefits of Using Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients With Metachronous Oligometastases of Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Detected by 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET/CT.', 'A phase II randomized trial of Observation versus stereotactic ablative RadiatIon for OLigometastatic prostate CancEr (ORIOLE).', 'OLIGOPELVIS - GETUG P07: a multicentre phase II trial of combined salvage radiotherapy and hormone therapy in oligometastatic pelvic node relapses of prostate cancer.', 'Local ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer.', 'Local therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer: a new standard of care?', 'Single-Center Experience of Focal Thermo-Ablative Therapy After Pelvic Radiotherapy for In-Field Prostate Cancer Oligo-Recurrence.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in metachronous oligometastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis on the current prospective evidence.', 'The Role of Exenterative Surgery in Advanced Urological Neoplasms.', '18F-fluciclovine PET-CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT in patients with early biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy: a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, comparative imaging trial.']"""

Based on the success of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), here we report a theranostic design of small-molecule drug conjugates (T-SMDCs) for targeted imaging and chemotherapy of prostate cancer. The structure of T-SMDCs built upon a polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffold consists of (i) a chelating moiety for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging when labeled with (68)Ga, a positron-emitting radioisotope; (ii) a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) specific ligand for prostate cancer targeting; and (iii) a cytotoxic drug (DM1) for chemotherapy. For proof-of-concept, such a T-SMDC, NO3A-DM1-Lys-Urea-Glu, was synthesized and evaluated. The chemical modification of Lys-Urea-Glu for the construction of the conjugate did not compromise its specific binding affinity to PSMA. The PSMA-mediated internalization of (68)Ga-labeled NO3A-DM1-Lys-Urea-Glu displayed a time-dependent manner, allowing the desired drug delivery and release within tumor cells.

Inappropriate reactivation of the AR after androgen deprivation therapy promotes development of incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we provide evidence that metabolic features of prostate cancer cells can be exploited to sensitize CRPC cells to AR antagonism. We identify a feedback loop between ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY)-dependent fatty acid synthesis, AMPK, and the AR in prostate cancer cells that could contribute to therapeutic resistance by maintaining AR levels. When combined with an AR antagonist, ACLY inhibition in CRPC cells promotes energetic stress and AMPK activation, resulting in further suppression of AR levels and target gene expression, inhibition of proliferation, and apoptosis. Supplying exogenous fatty acids can restore energetic homeostasis; however, this rescue does not occur through increased β-oxidation to support mitochondrial ATP production. Instead, concurrent inhibition of ACLY and AR may drive excess ATP consumption as cells attempt to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is prevented by fatty acid supplementation. Thus, fatty acid metabolism plays a key role in coordinating ER and energetic homeostasis in CRPC cells, thereby sustaining AR action and promoting proliferation. Consistent with a role for fatty acid metabolism in sustaining AR levels in prostate cancer in vivo, AR mRNA levels in human prostate tumors correlate positively with expression of ACLY and other fatty acid synthesis genes. The ACLY-AMPK-AR network can be exploited to sensitize CRPC cells to AR antagonism, suggesting novel therapeutic opportunities for prostate cancer.""","""['Supriya Shah', 'Whitney J Carriveau', 'Jinyang Li', 'Sydney L Campbell', 'Piotr K Kopinski', 'Hee-Woong Lim', 'Natalie Daurio', 'Sophie Trefely', 'Kyoung-Jae Won', 'Douglas C Wallace', 'Constantinos Koumenis', 'Anthony Mancuso', 'Kathryn E Wellen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase induces triglyceride accumulation with altered fatty acid composition in cancer cells.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Fatty acid metabolism: A new therapeutic target for cervical cancer.', 'Cytoskeletal association of ATP citrate lyase controls the mechanodynamics of macropinocytosis.', 'Is There a Role of Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness?

Differentiation between post-treatment changes and recurrence is difficult. (18)F-methyl-choline ((18)F-FCH) is frequently used in staging and detection of recurrent prostate cancer disease as well as some brain tumours; however accumulation in inflammatory tissue limits its specificity. The (18)F-ethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) shows a specific uptake in malignant cells, resulting from increased expression of amino acid transporters or diffusing through the disrupted blood-brain barrier. (18)F-FET exhibits lower uptake in machrophages and other inflammatory cells. Aim of this study was to evaluate (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET uptake by human glioblastoma T98G cells.  Material and methods:   Human glioblastoma T98G or human dermal fibroblasts cells, seeded at a density to obtain 2 × 10(5) cells per flask when radioactive tracers were administered, grew adherent to the plastic surface at 37°C in 5% CO2 in complete medium. Equimolar amounts of radiopharmaceuticals were added to cells for different incubation times (20 to 120 minutes) for (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET respectively. The cellular radiotracer uptake was determined with a gamma counter. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated three times. The uptake measurements are expressed as the percentage of the administered dose of tracer per 2 × 10(5) cells. Data (expressed as mean values of % uptake of radiopharmaceuticals) were compared using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate. Differences were regarded as statistically significant when p<0.05.  Results:   A significant uptake of (18)F-FCH was seen in T98G cells at 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The percentage uptake of (18)F-FET in comparison to (18)F-FCH was lower by a factor of more than 3, with different kinetic curves.(18)F-FET showed a more rapid initial uptake up to 40 minutes and (18)F-FCH showed a progressive rise reaching a maximum after 90 minutes.  Conclusions:   (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET are candidates for neuro-oncological PET imaging. (18)F-FET could be the most useful oncological PET marker in the presence of reparative changes after therapy, where the higher affinity of (18)F-FCH to inflammatory cells makes it more difficult to discriminate between tumour persistence and non-neoplastic changes.

The cancer death data from 1983 to 2012 and the population projection data from 1983 to 2032 were obtained from the Korean National Statistics Office. Based on our analysis, age-standardized rates with the world standard population of all cancer deaths were estimated to decline from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (men: -39.8%, women: -33.1%). However, the crude rates are predicted to rise (men: 29.8%, women: 24.4%), and the overall number of the cancer deaths is also estimated to increase (men: 35.5%, women: 32.3%). Several cancer deaths are projected to increase (lung, liver and gallbladder, colon and rectum, pancreas and leukemia in both sexes; prostate cancer in men; and breast and ovarian cancer in women), whereas other cancer deaths are expected to decrease (stomach, esophagus and larynx in both sexes and cervical cancer in women). The largest contribution to increasing cancer deaths is due to the aging of the Korean population.

It was applied recently in an article in Journal of Clinical Oncology to measure the impact of using a genomic risk model for deciding on adjuvant radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. We illustrate the use of decision curves for evaluating clinical- and biomarker-based models for predicting a man's risk of prostate cancer, which could be used to guide the decision to biopsy. Decision curves are grounded in a decision-theoretical framework that accounts for both the benefits of intervention and the costs of intervention to a patient who cannot benefit. Decision curves are thus an improvement over purely mathematical measures of performance such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, there are challenges in using and interpreting decision curves appropriately. We caution that decision curves cannot be used to identify the optimal risk threshold for recommending intervention. We discuss the use of decision curves for miscalibrated risk models. Finally, we emphasize that a decision curve shows the performance of a risk model in a population in which every patient has the same expected benefit and cost of intervention. If every patient has a personal benefit and cost, then the curves are not useful. If subpopulations have different benefits and costs, subpopulation-specific decision curves should be used.

More efforts have focused on the regulation effects of apoptosis on autophagy, whereas how autophagy affects apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study performed on prostate cancer cells, we investigated the role of autophagy in adriamycin-induced apoptosis, as well as the mechanisms mediating the effects of autophagy on apoptosis response to adriamycin (ADM). The results show that ADM not only inhibited cell viability and enhanced apoptosis, but also promoted autophagy via PI3K/Akt(T308)/mTOR signal pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by either pharmacological inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or RNA interference of Atg5 increased ADM-induced apoptosis and enhanced the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, blockade of autophagy augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by ADM. Scavenging of ROS by antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reversed the strengthened effects of CQ on ADM-induced apoptosis and rescued the cells from apoptosis. The results identified ROS as a potential mediator directing the modulation effects of the protective autophagy on apoptosis response to ADM.

We hypothesized that the use of clinical and imaging criteria could maximize tissue acquisition from bone marrow biopsies (BMBs). We aimed to develop a score for the selection of patients undergoing BMB.  Materials and methods:   A total of 115 BMBs were performed in 101 patients: 57 were included in a derivation set and 58 were used as the validation set. The clinical and laboratory data and prebiopsy computed tomography parameters (Hounsfield units [HUs]) were determined. A score for the prediction of biopsy positivity was developed from logistic regression analysis of the derivation set and tested in the validation set.  Results:   Of the 115 biopsy specimens, 75 (62.5%) were positive; 35 (61.4%) in the test set and 40 (69%) in the validation set. On univariable analysis, hemoglobin (P = .019), lactate dehydrogenase (P = .003), prostate-specific antigen (P = .005), and mean HUs (P = .004) were selected. A score based on the LDH level (≥ 225 IU/L) and mean HUs (≥ 125) was developed in multivariate analysis and was associated with BMB positivity in the validation set (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.9%-13.4%; P = .001). The area under the curve of the score was 0.79 in the test set and 0.77 in the validation set.  Conclusion:   BMB of the iliac crest is a feasible technique for obtaining tumor tissue for genomic analysis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to the bone.

Use of luciferase reporter genes is the method of choice of many researchers as it is well tolerated, relatively easy to use, and robust. Further, luciferase lends itself to the process as it can penetrate tissue and can be manipulated to degrade rapidly thus allowing a dynamic response. However, limited resolution, lack of quantitation, and the largely two-dimensional images acquired make it desirable to support results using ex vivo imaging and enzymatic and/or immunohistochemical analysis of dissected tissue. As well as enabling the visualization of nuclear receptor signaling in wild-type animals, crossing these mouse models with models of disease will provide invaluable information on how such signaling is dysregulated during disease progression, and how we may manipulate nuclear receptor signaling in therapy.

Methods:   Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in 2011 to 2012 were identified from NSQIP, which is a multi-institutional database of comprehensive 30-day postoperative outcomes. Wound complication included superficial surgical site infections (SSIs), deep SSI, organ space infections, and dehiscence. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression examined the relationship between obesity and wound complications in open and robotic radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Of the 12,454 radical prostatectomy cases reported in the study period, 9248 were robotic (74%), 2244 (18%) patients were normal weight (body mass index [BMI] <25), 5836 (47%) were overweight (BMI 25-30), and 4374 (35%) were obese (BMI >30). Wound complications occurred in 134 (4%) of open and 114 (1%) of robotic radical prostatectomies. After adjusting for age, history of smoking, history of diabetes, history of chronic steroid use, and operative time, it was determined that obese patients were at 71% increased odds of developing a wound complication after open prostatectomy (p = 0.034), while there was no difference in the odds of a wound complication after robotic radical prostatectomy (odds ratio 1.14, p = 0.665).

A number of occupational exposures in natural resource-based industries are suspected to be related to prostate cancer risk. This study investigates associations between employment in these industries and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data were from a population-based, case-control study previously conducted in Northeastern Ontario. Incident cases (N=760) aged 45-85 years and diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 1998 were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry. Controls (N=1632) were recruited using telephone listings, and were frequency matched to cases by age. Lifetime occupational history was collected for all participants. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and their associated 95% CIs.  Results:   Elevated risks were observed for employment in forestry and logging industries (OR=1.87, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.73) and occupations (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.35), and these risks increased with duration of employment for ≥10 years. Elevated risks were also found for employment in wood products industries (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.97), and paper and allied products industries (OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.00), and when duration of employment was ≥10 years. There were also elevated risks in agriculture and mining-related work; however, these findings were not consistent across industry and occupation categories.

We found that Taurine levels in normal tissue are 4-6ng. But, the amount of Taurine of average normal value of 5.0-5.25ng was strikingly reduced to 0.0025-0.0028ng in this study of several examples in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, prostate, and lung, as well as breast cancer.

This medicational modality may induce consequential losses that can lead to spontaneous or surgical therapy related bone fractures or defects. MRONJ stages and treatment alternatives are described in the current procedures. Accordingly, treatments for stages 0 and 1 are conservative whereas the treatment for stage 3 is surgical resection of the necrotic bone. Stage III MRONJ therapy is still controversial within the scope of conceivable bone fractures or defects. When the development of MRONJ is refractory to conventional treatment modalities, surgical management can be suggested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of the surgical treatment of MRONJ as part of a medical patient.  Methods:   A 72-year-old man was referred to our department for extensive pain of the left mandibular region that occurred after tooth extraction. It was identified in his medical history that he had received a nitrogen-containing intravenous bisphosphonate (Zometa; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) therapy for prostate cancer. He had been administered 4 mg. IV Zolenat 9 times during the first year of therapy, followed by 2 doses of the same amount of Zolenat in the second year.  Results:   The treatment started with a therapy that combined antibiotics and antibacterial mouth rinse with chlorhexidine for maintaining oral hygiene. After the maturity of the sequestrum was identified through radiographic examination, the patient was treated by the segmental resection of the extensive necrotic bone, resulting in discontinuity of the mandibular corpus. Two years later, spontaneous bone healing occurred along the residual defect on the mandible.  Conclusion:   Treatment options for the defects resulting from MRONJ are still under debate, and no evidence-based guidelines are available. However, due to the results displayed in this patient; it may be a sound approach to closely follow up and observe MRONJ-related bone to prevent additional complications.""","""['Mürüde Yazan', 'Fethi Atil', 'Ismail Doruk Kocyigit', 'Umut Tekin', 'Hakan Hifzi Tuz', 'Melda Misirlioglu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Craniofac Surg""","""['Treatment of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw.', 'Conservative surgical treatment of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) lesions in patients affected by osteoporosis exposed to oral bisphosphonates: 24 months follow-up.', 'Position paper on medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).', 'Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: Prevention, diagnosis and management in patients with cancer and bone metastases.', 'An unusual case of bone regeneration of a necrotic mandible with pathologic fracture in an elderly hemodialysis patient with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a case report and review of the\xa0literature.', 'Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws: Two Center Retrospective Cohort Studies.']"""

It is demonstrated that, with the optimal balance of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, one of the self-assembled nanomicellar systems, totally devoid of toxic side effects, is able to deliver small interfering RNA and achieve effective gene silencing both in cells - including the highly refractory human hematopoietic CD34(+) stem cells - and in vivo, thus paving the way for future biomedical implementation. This work presents a case study of the concept of generating functional supramolecular dendrimers via self-assembly. The ability of carefully designed and gauged building blocks to assemble into supramolecular structures opens new perspectives on the design of self-assembling nanosystems for complex and functional applications.""","""['Chao Chen', 'Paola Posocco', 'Xiaoxuan Liu', 'Qiang Cheng', 'Erik Laurini', 'Jiehua Zhou', 'Cheng Liu', 'Yang Wang', 'Jingjie Tang', 'Valentina Dal Col', 'Tianzhu Yu', 'Suzanne Giorgio', 'Maurizio Fermeglia', 'Fanqi Qu', 'Zicai Liang', 'John J Rossi', 'Minghua Liu', 'Palma Rocchi', 'Sabrina Pricl', 'Ling Peng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Small""","""['Self-Assembling Supramolecular Dendrimers for Biomedical Applications: Lessons Learned from Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimers.', 'Efficient delivery of sticky siRNA and potent gene silencing in a prostate cancer model using a generation 5 triethanolamine-core PAMAM dendrimer.', 'An amphiphilic dendrimer for effective delivery of small interfering RNA and gene silencing in vitro and in vivo.', 'Surface Engineered Dendrimers in siRNA Delivery and Gene Silencing.', 'Cationic Dendrimers for siRNA Delivery: An Overview of Methods for In Vitro/In Vivo Characterization.', 'Cargo-selective and adaptive delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics by bola-amphiphilic dendrimers.', 'Properties and Bioapplications of Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers: A Review.', 'An Overview of the Supramolecular Systems for Gene and Drug Delivery in Tissue Regeneration.', 'Amphiphilic Dendrimer Vectors for RNA Delivery: State-of-the-Art and Future Perspective.', 'Supramolecular Self-Associations of Amphiphilic Dendrons and Their Properties.']"""

To investigate the association between a dietary inflammatory index (DII) and PCa survival, we conducted a retrospective cohort study including 726 men with PCa originally enrolled, between 1995 and 2002, in an Italian case-control study. Information on diet and Gleason score was collected at PCa diagnosis. DII was derived from a food frequency questionnaire using a validated algorithm. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of death with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Fine-Gray model. DII scores were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality of PCa patients (HR highest vs. lowest DII tertile = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.86-1.83). However, considerable heterogeneity emerged according to Gleason score (p < 0.01): no associations emerged among men with Gleason score 2-6 PCa; whereas, among patients with Gleason score 7-10 PCa, DII was directly associated with both all-cause and PCa-specific mortality (HR highest vs. lowest DII tertile: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.41-5.48; and 4.01; 95% CI: 1.25-12.86; respectively).

R2 (*) mapping with Mono-Exponential (ME) decay modeling has shown potential for identifying areas of prostate cancer hypoxia at 1.5T. However, Gaussian deviations from ME decay have been observed in other tissues at 3T. The purpose of this study is to assess whether gradient-echo signal decays are better characterized by a standard ME decay model, or a Gaussian Augmentation of the Mono-Exponential (GAME) decay model, in the prostate at 3T. Multi-gradient-echo signals were acquired on 20 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer undergoing MR-guided prostate biopsies. Data were fitted with both ME and GAME models. The information contents of these models were compared using Akaike's information criterion (second order, AICC ), in skeletal muscle, the prostate central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ) regions of interest (ROIs). The GAME model had higher information content in 30% of the prostate on average (across all patients and ROIs), covering up to 67% of cancerous PZ ROIs, and up to 100% of cancerous CG ROIs (in individual patients). The higher information content of GAME became more prominent in regions that would be assumed hypoxic using ME alone, reaching 50% of the PZ and 70% of the CG as ME R2 (*) approached 40 s(-1) . R2 (*) mapping may have important applications in MRI; however, information lost due to modeling could mask differences in parameters due to underlying tissue anatomy or physiology.

It is involved in human cancer cell growth and differentiation, and plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Although, its expression has been reported in various cancers, there are limited data in genitourinary malignancies. Recent studies found GATA3 to be a sensitive marker for urothelial carcinoma (UC) and associated with prognostic pathologic features. Its level of expression was found to be an independent factor predicting cancer recurrence.  Methods and materials:   In this article, immunohistochemical evaluation of GATA3 expression in genitourinary malignancies (invasive UC, renal cell carcinoma, and prostatic adenocarcinomas) was performed.  Results:   GATA3 was positive in 56/79 (70.8%) of invasive UC, and was negative in all renal cell carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinomas. The pattern of GATA3 staining, when positive, was intensely nuclear within the clusters of malignant cells. No cytoplasmic staining was noted. Negative controls were all negative. High GATA3 expression was associated with larger tumor size in invasive UC (3.19cm vs. 1.65cm, P = 0.01). GATA3 expression did not correlate with other clinicopathologic parameters in UC.  Conclusions:   This data suggest that GATA3 is a sensitive marker in confirming invasive UC, and may be helpful in differentiating it from metastatic tumors of renal and prostatic origin. Furthermore, strong GATA3 expression was noted to have an effect on tumor size in patients with UC.""","""['Kareem Hosny Mohammed', 'Momin T Siddiqui', 'Cynthia Cohen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Utility of GATA3 immunohistochemistry in differentiating urothelial carcinoma from prostate adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix, anus, and lung.', 'Placental S100 (S100P) and GATA3: markers for transitional epithelium and urothelial carcinoma discovered by complementary DNA microarray.', 'GATA3 expression in metastatic urothelial carcinoma in fine needle aspiration cell blocks: a review of 25 cases.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Immunohistochemical Pitfalls in Genitourinary Pathology: 2018 Update.', 'Management of Primary Female Urethral Adenocarcinoma: Two Rare Case Reports and Literature Review.', 'Diagnostic Relevance of GATA 3 Expression in Urinary Bladder Carcinoma of Divergent Differentiation and Other Histological Variants.', 'Association Between Estrogen Receptors and GATA3 in Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Their Clinicopathological Significance.', 'Overexpressed GATA3 enhances the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin through regulating MiR-29b.', 'Advanced primary urethral cancer: a case report.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 122 men with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate referred to radiation oncology underwent 3-T eMRI between 2010 and 2014, to evaluate candidacy for active surveillance (n = 26) and brachytherapy as monotherapy (n = 47), or to further risk stratify intermediate-risk (n = 29) or high-risk (n = 20) men before external beam radiation therapy. By National Comprehensive Cancer Network classification, men had low-risk (28%), intermediate-risk (55%), or high-risk (17%) disease. Multiparametric MRI sequences included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Radiographic extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion (rSVI), and pelvic lymph node involvement (LNI) were graded as negative, indeterminate, or positive. A dominant nodule was defined as a nodule≥1.5cm. Changes in management were identified comparing pre-MRI and post-MRI plan of care.  Results:   The rates of radiographic extracapsular extension, radiographic seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and dominant nodule were 39%, 7%, 12%, and 28%, respectively. The eMRI identified measurable disease in most patients with an increasing burden of disease (sextants involved, median nodule size) according to risk category (P<0.01). Changes in management after eMRI occurred in 18%, including 9%, 18%, and 33% of men with low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk disease (P = 0.08), and 12%, 17%, and 22% of men who were candidates for active surveillance, brachytherapy as monotherapy, or external beam radiation therapy (P = 0.48), respectively.

Our results showed that knockdown of HMGA2 markedly inhibited cell proliferation; this reduced cell proliferation was due to the promotion of cell apoptosis as the Bcl-xl was decreased, whereas Bax was up-regulated. In addition, we found that HMGA2 knockdown resulted in reduction of cell migration and invasion, as well as repressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and affected the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both cell types.

Materials and methods:   Single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (SS-DWI) and multi-shot segmented (MS-DWI) were performed intra-procedurally on a 3Tesla system in a total of 35 men, who underwent in-bore prostate biopsy inside the scanner bore. Comparisons between SS-DWI and MS-DWI were performed with (in 16 men) and without (in 19 men) parallel coil acceleration (iPAT) for SS-DWI. Overall image quality and artifacts were scored by a radiologist and scores were compared with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank test. Correlation between the presence of air and image quality scores was evaluated with Spearman statistics. To quantify distortion, the anteroposterior prostate dimension was measured in SS and MS b=0 diffusion- and T2-weighted images. Signal-to-noise ratio was estimated in a phantom experiment. Agreement and accuracy of targeting based on retrospective localization of restricted diffusion areas in DWI was evaluated with respect to the targets identified using multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI).  Results:   Compared to SS-DWI without iPAT, the average image quality score in MS-DWI improved from 2.0 to 3.3 (p<0.005) and the artifact score improved from 2.3 to 1.4 (p<0.005). When iPAT was used in SS-DWI, the average image quality score in MS-DWI improved from 2.6 to 3.3 (p<0.05) and the artifact score improved from 2.1 to 1.4 (p<0.01). Image quality (ρ=-0.74, p<0.0005) and artifact scores (ρ=0.77, p<0.0005) both showed strong correlation with the presence of air in the rectum for the SS-DWI sequence without iPAT. These correlations remained significant when iPAT was enabled (ρ=-0.52, p<0.05 and ρ=0.64, p<0.01). For the comparison MS-DWI vs SS-DWI without iPAT, median differences between diffusion- and T2-weighted image gland measurements were 1.1(0.03-10.4)mm and 4.4(0.5-22.7)mm, respectively. In the SS-DWI-iPAT cohort, median gland dimension differences were 2.7(0.4-5.9)mm and 4.2(0.7-8.9)mm, respectively. Out of the total of 89 targets identified in mpMRI, 20 had corresponding restricted diffusion areas in SS-DWI and 28 in MS-DWI. No statistically significant difference was observed between the distances for the targets in the target-concordant SS- and MS-DWI restricted diffusion areas (5.5mm in SS-DWI vs 4.5mm in MS-DWI, p>0.05).  Conclusions:   MS-DWI applied to prostate imaging leads to a significant reduction of image distortion in comparison with SS-DWI. There is no sufficient evidence however to suggest that intra-procedural DWI can serve as a replacement for tracking of the targets identified in mpMRI for the purposes of targeted MRI-guided prostate biopsy.""","""['Andriy Fedorov', 'Kemal Tuncali', 'Lawrence P Panych', 'Janice Fairhurst', 'Elmira Hassanzadeh', 'Ravi T Seethamraju', 'Clare M Tempany', 'Stephan E Maier']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Small Field-of-view single-shot EPI-DWI of the prostate: Evaluation of spatially-tailored two-dimensional radiofrequency excitation pulses.', 'Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging for diffusion-weighted imaging in the pelvis at 3T-A feasibility study.', 'Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging improves the image quality of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in rectal cancer: Comparison with single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative diffusion MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.', 'Diffusion and quantification of diffusion of prostate cancer.', 'New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.', 'Accelerated Segmented Diffusion-Weighted Prostate Imaging for Higher Resolution, Higher Geometric Fidelity, and Multi-b Perfusion Estimation.', 'Quantitative diffusion MRI using reduced field-of-view and multi-shot acquisition techniques: Validation in phantoms and prostate imaging.']"""

Methods:   Newly diagnosed men were enrolled in the North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effectiveness and Survivorship Study. PROMIS measures were telephone-administered pre-treatment (baseline), and at 3-months and 12-months post-treatment initiation (N = 778). Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Dimensionality was examined with bifactor models and explained common variance (ECV). Ordinal logistic regression models were used to detect potential differential item functioning (DIF) for key demographic groups. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed by correlations with the legacy instruments Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer and SF-12v2. Known-groups validity was examined by age, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and treatment.  Results:   Each PROMIS measure had high Cronbach's alpha values (0.86-0.96) and was sufficiently unidimensional. Floor effects were observed for anxiety, depression, and pain interference measures; ceiling effects were observed for physical function. No DIF was detected. Convergent validity was established with moderate to strong correlations between PROMIS and legacy measures (0.41-0.77) of similar constructs. Discriminant validity was demonstrated with weak correlations between measures of dissimilar domains (-0.20--0.31). PROMIS measures detected differences across age, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity groups; no differences were found by treatment.

Methods:   Twenty-one patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA) PET/CT at a median of 4 d (range, 0-47 d) before radical prostatectomy. Based on a 6-segment model, the Gleason score and proportion of tumor tissue within each segment (segmental tumor burden, or STB) as determined by histopathology (STBHP) were correlated with SUVmax and STB as determined by different SUV cutoffs for 68Ga-PSMA PET (STBPET1-6). Furthermore, the involvement of seminal vesicles and other extracapsular extension were assessed by histopathology and PET/CT.  Results:   Histopathology-positive segments (n = 100 of 126; 79%) demonstrated a significantly higher mean ± SD SUVmax (11.8 ± 7.6) than histopathology-negative segments (4.9 ± 2.9; P < 0.001). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis revealed an optimal SUVmax cutoff of 6.5 for discrimination of histopathology-positive segments from histopathology-negative segments (area under the curve, 0.84; P < 0.001), which gave 67% sensitivity, 92% specificity, a 97% positive predictive value, a 42% negative predictive value, and 72% accuracy.

Materials and methods:   We examined relationships with quality of life using FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy). We also hypothesized variables in a sample of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who represented different time points since treatment, including less than 12 months in 70, 1 to 3 years in 344, greater than 3 to 5 years in 291 and greater than 5 years in 97. Correlative measures included subscales of MAX-PC (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), short forms of PROMIS® and SOMS (Surgical Outcomes Measurement System), TDM-SATS (Treatment Decision-Making Satisfaction Scale) and subscales of the BFI (Big Five Inventory) of personality.  Results:   Quality of life was significantly associated with hypothesized variables across different time cohorts. In regression models several factors accounted for most of the variability in quality of life scores depending on time since treatment, including 47%, 22%, 29% and 27% at less than 12 months, 1 to 3 years, greater than 3 to 5 years and greater than 5 years, respectively.

CRAFTT combines ChIP-seq with drug-induced expression profiling to identify small molecules that can specifically perturb TF activity. Application to ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets revealed known drug-TF interactions, and a global drug-protein network analysis supported these predictions. Application of CRAFTT to ERG, a pro-invasive, frequently overexpressed oncogenic TF, predicted that dexamethasone would inhibit ERG activity. Dexamethasone significantly decreased cell invasion and migration in an ERG-dependent manner. Furthermore, analysis of electronic medical record data indicates a protective role for dexamethasone against prostate cancer.

Several studies have reported that nuclear grade and mitotic index (MI) are prognostically useful.  Patients and methods:   This study included 232 radical prostatectomy specimens. Nuclear anaplasia (NA) was determined on the basis of nucleomegali (at least 20µm); vesicular chromatin; eosinophilic macronucleoli, nuclear lobulation, and irregular thickened nuclear membranei. The proportion of area of NA was recorded in each tumor in 10% increments. The MI was defined as the number of mitotic figures in 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPF).  Results:   In univariate analysis, significant differences included associations between biochemical prostate-specific antigen recurrence (BCR) and Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margin, the presence of high-pathologic stage, NA≥10% of tumor area, MI≥3/10 HPF, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. In a stepwise Cox regression model, a positive surgical margin, the presence of a NA≥10% of tumor area, and a MI of≥3/10 HPF were independent predictors of BCR after radical prostatectomy. NA≥10% of tumor area appeared to have a stronger association with outcome than MI≥3/10 HPF, as still associated with BCR when Gleason score was in the model.

The smaller the prostate size (obtained by rectal examination) post-RT, the more the chance for an abnormal EMG (p < 0.001). The fact of having had received RT (p < 0.001) is the only risk factor.

Rates of HCM differ by tumor type, with highest rates reported in multiple myeloma and lowest among colorectal and prostate cancer patients. This analysis estimates HCM prevalence in the US. This retrospective study used the Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records (OSCER) warehouse of electronic health records (EHR) including laboratory values from 569000 patients treated at 565 oncology outpatient sites. OSCER data were projected to the national level by linking EHR to claims data. Cancer patients included were ≥18 years, and had serum calcium (Ca) and albumin (for corrected serum Ca [CSC]) records. Period prevalence was estimated by HCM CTCAE grade, tumor type, and year (2009-2013). Estimates were adjusted to capture patients diagnosed with HCM outside oncology practices based on a subset of patients linkable to office and hospital data. The analysis included 68023 (2009) to 121482 (2013) cancer patients. In 2013, patients with HCM had a median of six Ca tests, 69.7% had chemotherapy, and 34% received bone modifying agents. HCM rates were highest for multiple myeloma patients (7.5% [2012]-10.2% [2010]), lowest for prostate cancer (1.4% [2012]-2.1% [2011]).The estimated adjusted annual prevalence of HCM from 2009 to 2013 was 95441, 96281, 89797, 70158, and 71744, respectively. HCM affected 2.0-2.8% of all cancer patients. EHR data from oncology clinics were critical for this study because these data contain results from laboratory studies (i.e., serum calcium values) that are routinely ordered in that setting. We estimated that the prevalence of HCM in the US in 2013 is 71744, affecting approximately 2% of cancer patients overall. This percentage differs by tumor type and appears to have decreased over the five-year study period.""","""['Victor M Gastanaga', 'Lee S Schwartzberg', 'Rajul K Jain', 'Melissa Pirolli', 'David Quach', 'Jane M Quigley', 'George Mu', 'W Scott Stryker', 'Alexander Liede']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Prevalence of hypercalcemia of malignancy among cancer patients in the UK: analysis of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database.', 'Hypercalcemia caused by humoral effects and bone damage indicate poor outcomes in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.', 'Outcomes of hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with solid cancer: a national inpatient analysis.', 'Overview of hypercalcemia of malignancy.', 'Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy with bisphosphonates.', 'Predicting survival for patients with mesothelioma: development of the PLACE prognostic model.', 'Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor producing cervical cancer with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein: a case report and literature review.', 'Treatment Outcomes and Survival in Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: A Grave Metabolic Emergency.', 'Prevalence and Clinicopathologic Characteristics of Hypercalcemia in Patients With Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Hypercalcemia Associated with the Ectopic Expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1α-hydroxylase in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.']"""

We evaluated the rate of medical complications following RALRP in a national dataset of safety events, and assessed whether age is an independent risk factor for these complications. Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing RALRP between 2009 and 2012 in the prospectively maintained American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement (ACS-NSQIP) database was performed. Demographic and comorbid data were collated, medical complications occurring during the 30-day post-operative period were identified. We identified age-related comorbidities, and complications associated with these comorbidities. A binary logistic regression model with age and age-related comorbidities as predictors and specific complication as outcome, was used to evaluate whether age is an independent risk factor for these complications. 12,123 patients underwent RALRP between 2009 and 2012, with a mean age of 62 (22-92). Post-operative medical complications included urinary tract infection (UTI) (1.77 %), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (0.67 %), pulmonary embolism (PE) (0.45 %), pneumonia (PNA) (0.27 %), myocardial infarction (MI) (0.12 %), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (0.01 %). Nine comorbidities were positively correlated with age (p < 0.05). Four medical complications were associated with these age-related comorbidities: MI, CVA, PNA, and UTI. On multivariate analysis, age was an independent risk factor for post-operative PNA (p < 0.05), but not for MI (p = 0.09), UTI (p = 0.3) or CVA (p = 0.2). Patient age was independently associated with post-operative pneumonia only.

We retrospectively reviewed the 387 patients who had died to determine the incidence of PCa-related urological complications, associated factors, and subsequent palliative interventions.  Results:   Major urological complications that required therapeutic intervention were observed in 28.4 % of PCa patients dying from the disease itself, whereas such complications were much less frequent (4.3 %) in PCa patients dying from other causes. Urological complications were associated with local recurrence in men who underwent prostatectomy, lower irradiation dose in men who underwent radiotherapy, and pretreatment higher T stage and absence of metastasis in men who underwent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the primary treatment. Patients who received long-term ADT for localized disease had the highest risk for urological complications. Therapeutic intervention was highly effective for palliation.

Methods and materials:   An interneedle dual source strength planning strategy is described for focal low-dose-rate brachytherapy of the prostate. The implanted treatment plans were designed using peripheral (except near the rectum) needles loaded with high strength (0.9 U) sources and central needles loaded with low strength (0.4 U) sources (""interneedle"" dual strength planning). This approach has been applied for focally treating 3 patients. In this article, we compare the characteristics and robustness to source motion of interneedle dual strength planning with four alternative planning strategies (single strength high, low, and intermediate, and intraneedle dual strength) on 50 simulated cases.  Results:   Interneedle dual source strength planning results in greater robustness to source motion and overall lower seed and needle density compared to the standard low source strength planning currently used in our centre. This planning approach is also significantly superior to single strength high, single strength intermediate and intraneedle dual strength planning strategies in terms of high dose to the urethral avoidance structure.  Conclusions:   The use of interneedle dual source strength treatment plans for focal low-dose-rate brachytherapy is possibly the practical solution for limiting the density of sources required to deliver the prescribed dose while limiting proximity of high strength sources to organs at risk.""","""['S Sara Mahdavi', 'Ingrid T Spadinger', 'Nicholas T Chng', 'W James Morris']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Influence of source batch S dispersion on dosimetry for prostate cancer treatment with permanent implants.', 'Dosimetry Modeling for Focal Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Interstitial rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Modern Brachytherapy.', 'Use of flexible needles and ways to control their placement in robot-assisted prostate brachytherapy.', 'Focal application of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a pilot study.']"""

To determine if SOX9 plays a role in the development of endometrial cancer we overexpressed Sox9 in the uterine epithelium using a progesterone receptor-Cre mouse model. Sox9 overexpression in the uterine epithelium led to the formation of simple and complex cystic glandular structures in the endometrium of aged-females. Histological analysis revealed that these structures appeared morphologically similar to structures present in patients with endometrial hyperplastic lesions and endometrial polyps that are thought to be precursors of endometrial cancer. The molecular mechanisms that cause the glandular epithelium to become hyperplastic, leading to endometrial cancer are still poorly understood.

Methods:   From 1969 to 2009, we identified 1010 from 3567 patients with RCC. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimate for histological subtypes including 109 chRCC and 901 ccRCC. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in patient characteristics among histological subgroups.  Results:   The median follow-up was 61 months (range 0-289). chRCC showed longer OS (5 year, 90.1%; 10 year, 74.2%; 15 year, 61.4%) and CSS (94.2%, 89.7%, 89.7%) compared with ccRCC (OS 75.7%, 54.9%, 46.1% and CSS 84.7%, 75.4%, 72.2%; P = .002). Multivariate Cox regression revealed histology as a significant prognostic factor. Propensity score matching showed a difference in 72.4% (OS) and 87.2% (CSS) of matching attempts confirming the significant impact of histology. Univariate Cox regression showed nephron sparing surgery, no metastasis and no symptoms at presentation, age <65, eosinophilic features, low American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index to be beneficial for CSS. Only age at surgery, metastasis at presentation, and American Society of Anesthesiologists and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were significant factors for OS in chRCC patients.  Conclusion:   ChRCC appears to have a favorable outcome compared with ccRCC. Even after adjustment for differences in characteristics known to have an influence on survival by propensity score matching, histology remains a significant prognostic factor.""","""['Sebastian Frees', 'Mohammed M Kamal', 'Lisa Knoechlein', 'Robert Bell', 'Christopher Ziesel', 'Andreas Neisius', 'Christian Thomas', 'Walburgis Brenner', 'Wolfgang Jäger', 'Joachim W Thüroff', 'Frederik C Roos']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC): oncological outcomes and prognostic factors in a large multicentre series.', 'Does chromophobe renal cell carcinoma have better survival than clear cell renal cell carcinoma?

Objective:   To determine if pretherapy nuclear androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) protein expression and localization on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a treatment-specific marker for response and outcomes between ARS inhibitors and taxanes.  Design, setting, and participants:   For this cross-sectional cohort study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 265 men with progressive mCRPC undergoing a change in treatment were considered; 86 were excluded because they were not initiating ARS or taxane therapy; and 18 were excluded for processing time constraints, leaving 161 patients for analysis. Between December 2012 and March 2015, blood was collected and processed from patients with progressive mCRPC immediately prior to new line of systemic therapy. Patients were followed up to 3 years.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time receiving therapy, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Overall, of 193 prospectively collected blood samples from 161 men with mCRPC, 191 were evaluable (128 pre-ARS inhibitor and 63 pretaxane). AR-V7-positive CTCs were found in 34 samples (18%), including 3% of first-line, 18% of second-line, and 31% of third- or greater line samples. Patients whose samples had AR-V7-positive CTCs before ARS inhibition had resistant posttherapy PSA changes (PTPC), shorter rPFS, shorter time on therapy, and shorter OS than those without AR-V7-positive CTCs. Overall, resistant PTPC were seen in 65 of 112 samples (58%) without detectable AR-V7-positive CTCs prior to ARS inhibition. There were statistically significant differences in OS but not in PTPC, time on therapy, or rPFS for patients with or without pretherapy AR-V7-positive CTCs treated with a taxane. A multivariable model adjusting for baseline factors associated with survival showed superior OS with taxanes relative to ARS inhibitors when AR-V7-positive CTCs were detected pretherapy (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .035).  Conclusions and relevance:   The results validate CTC nuclear expression of AR-V7 protein in men with mCRPC as a treatment-specific biomarker that is associated with superior survival on taxane therapy over ARS-directed therapy in a clinical practice setting. Continued examination of this biomarker in prospective studies will further aid clinical utility.""","""['Howard I Scher', 'David Lu', 'Nicole A Schreiber', 'Jessica Louw', 'Ryon P Graf', 'Hebert A Vargas', 'Ann Johnson', 'Adam Jendrisak', 'Richard Bambury', 'Daniel Danila', 'Brigit McLaughlin', 'Justin Wahl', 'Stephanie B Greene', 'Glenn Heller', 'Dena Marrinucci', 'Martin Fleisher', 'Ryan Dittamore']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Incorrect Affiliations and Updated Supplement.', 'AR-V7 Protein in Circulating Tumor Cells-The Decider for Therapy?', 'Re: Association of AR-V7 on Circulating Tumor Cells as a Treatment-Specific Biomarker with Outcomes and Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Nuclear-specific AR-V7 Protein Localization is Necessary to Guide Treatment Selection in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Individualized precision medicine.', 'Plasticity of circulating tumor cells in small cell lung cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'A novel biguanide derivative, IM176, induces prostate cancer cell death by modulating the AMPK-mTOR and androgen receptor signaling pathways.', 'Feasibility study of expressing epcam\u2009+\u2009/vimentin\u2009+\u2009CTC in prostate cancer diagnosis.']"""

Maire, a species endemic to Algeria and Morocco on which no reports are available to date. To evaluate in vitro the cytotoxic, antifungal and antimicrobial activities of this extract and the cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of its isolated secondary metabolites.  Methods:   The cytotoxic effects of the extract were investigated on 3 human cancer cell lines i.e. the A549 non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma and the U373 glioblastoma using a MTT colorimetric assay. Biological data allowed to guide the fractionation of the extract by separation and purification on silica gel 60 (CC and TLC). The isolated compounds which were characterized by spectral analysis, mainly HR-ESIMS, HR-EIMS, UV and NMR experiments ((1)H, (13)C, COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC) and comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature, were evaluated for cytotoxic activities on six cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, U373, Hs683 human glioma, PC3 human prostate and B16-F10 murine melanoma). The direct and indirect antibacterial and antifungal activities were determined using microdilution methods for the raw extract and TLC-bioautography and microdilution methods against standard and clinical strains for the isolated compounds.  Results:   The raw extract reduced cell viability with IC50s of 27, 25 and 21 μg/mL on A549, MCF7 and U373, respectively. Five secondary metabolites: two phenolic compounds (vanillin 1, paridol 3), a lignan [(-)-arctigenin 2] and two flavonoid aglycones (eupatilin 4 and jaceosidin 5), were then isolated from this extract. Moderate cytotoxic effects were observed for (-)-arctigenin 2 (IC50s: 28 and 33 μM on Hs683 and B16-F10, respectively), eupatilin 4 (IC50s: 33 and 47 μM on B16-F10 and PC3, respectively) and jaceosidin 5 (IC50s: 32 and 40 μM on PC3 and B16-F10, respectively).  Conclusions:   All the isolated compounds were described for the first time from this species. Although inactive against 7 tested microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and yeast, human or plant pathogens), the raw extract was able to potentiate the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), reducing the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by a factor of 2-32-fold. No synergy was found between the extract and streptomycin.

The aim of this study was (i) to assess if inflammatory cells incorporate choline and (ii) to potentially detect differences compared to FDG uptake. Therefore we investigated the uptake of [(3)H]choline and [(18)F]FDG in human prostate carcinoma cells and human inflammatory cells.  Methods:   Macrophages were cultured from isolated mononuclear cells, gained by density gradient centrifugation of human buffy coats. T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and granulocytes were enriched by density gradient centrifugation before cell sorting by means of flow cytometry was performed. [(3)H]choline and [(18)F]FDG uptake of isolated inflammatory cells as well as of LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells was assessed simultaneously in dual tracer uptake experiments.  Results:   Macrophages showed highest [(3)H]choline and [(18)F]FDG uptake compared to the tracer uptake rates of leukocytes. [(3)H]choline uptake of macrophages was in the same range as in prostate cancer cells. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages resulted in an increase of [(18)F]FDG uptake in macrophages, but not in an increased [(3)H]choline uptake.  Conclusions:   The high [(3)H]choline uptake in macrophages may be a source of false-positive PET results in diagnosis of prostate cancer by choline-PET/CT.

In addition, tracer uptake was measured in 16 sites of metastases.  Results:   The highest tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys, liver, upper large intestine, and the urinary bladder. Mean organ doses were: kidneys 0.262 ± 0.098 mGy/MBq, liver 0.031 ± 0.004 mGy/MBq, upper large intestine 0.054 ± 0.041 mGy/MBq, urinary bladder 0.13 ± 0.059 mGy/MBq.

Results:   BCR-free survival rates at 5, 10 and 15 years were 94, 90 and 86 %. In Cox regression analyses, TV, %HGTV and positive surgical margin status (SM) were independent predictors of BCR. Predictive accuracies (PA) at 5, 10 and 15 years of the base model (PSA, Gleason score, SM) were 76.8 % (95 % CI 67.9-78.2 %), 70.5 % (95 % CI 64.9-75.0 %) and 68.1 % (95 % CI 60.6-73.5 %). The full model, including TV and %HGTV, achieved 76.9, 72.4 and 70.7 %. These PA differences were statistically significant at 10 and 15 years (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   TV and %HGTV could potentially serve as valuable measures to stratify patients at high risk of BCR. The use of our nomogram should be considered to counsel patients with pT2 disease and SM and to design appropriate follow-up or treatment regimens.""","""['Christian P Meyer', 'Jens Hansen', 'Katharina Boehm', 'Derya Tilki', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Margit Fisch', 'Guido Sauter', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Sascha A Ahyai']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Percentage of high-grade tumour volume does not meaningfully improve prediction of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy compared with Gleason score.', 'Prognostic significance of a positive surgical margin in pathologically organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Challenging cases in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Index tumor volume on MRI as a predictor of clinical and pathologic outcomes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic influence of 3-dimensional tumor volume on breast cancer compared to conventional 1-dimensional tumor size.']"""

However long-term androgen deprivation may induce androgen-independent (AI) recurrence. Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) is a potential way to delay or avoid the AI relapse. Mathematical models of tumor growth and treatment are simple while they are capable of capturing the essence of complicated interactions. Game theory models have analyzed that tumor cells can enhance their fitness by adopting genetically determined survival strategies. In this paper, we consider the survival strategies as the competitive advantage of tumor cells and propose a new model to mimic the prostate tumor growth in IAS therapy. Then we investigate the competition effect in tumor development by numerical simulations. The results indicate that successfully IAS-controlled states can be achieved even though the net growth rate of AI cells is positive for any androgen level. There is crucial difference between the previous models and the new one in the phase diagram of successful and unsuccessful tumor control by IAS administration, which means that the suggestions from the models for medication can be different. Furthermore we introduce quadratic logistic terms to the competition model to simulate the tumor growth in the environment with a finite carrying capacity considering the nutrients or inhibitors. The simulations show that the tumor growth can reach an equilibrium state or an oscillatory state with the net growth rate of AI cells being androgen independent. Our results suggest that the competition and the restraint of a limited environment can enhance the possibility of relapse prevention.""","""['Jing Yang', 'Tong-Jun Zhao', 'Chang-Qing Yuan', 'Jing-Hui Xie', 'Fang-Fang Hao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['A nonlinear model with competition between prostate tumor cells and its application to intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer.', 'A new protocol for intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer with unstable saddle-point dynamics.', 'Model predictive control for optimally scheduling intermittent androgen suppression of prostate cancer.', 'Mathematical modelling of prostate cancer growth and its application to hormone therapy.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Applications of Liquid Biopsy in Prostate Cancer: From Screening to Predictive Biomarker.', 'Tumor growth inhibition modeling of individual lesion dynamics and interorgan variability in HER2-negative breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel.', 'A Review of Mathematical Models for Tumor Dynamics and Treatment Resistance Evolution of Solid Tumors.', 'Cooperation among cancer cells: applying game theory to cancer.']"""

The vast majority of prostate cancer deaths are due to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) - the lethal form of the disease that has progressed despite therapies that interfere with activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. One emergent resistance mechanism to medical castration is synthesis of intratumoral androgens that activate the AR. This insight led to the development of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. However, resistance to enzalutamide invariably develops, and disease progression is nearly universal. One mechanism of resistance to enzalutamide is an F877L mutation in the AR ligand-binding domain that can convert enzalutamide to an agonist of AR activity. However, mechanisms that contribute to the agonist switch had not been fully clarified, and there were no therapies to block AR F877L. Using cell line models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we determined that cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of mutant F877L AR. Further, enzalutamide treatment of AR F877L-expressing cell lines recapitulated the effects of androgen activation of F877L AR or wild-type AR. Because the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 was previously shown to block androgen activation of wild-type AR, we tested JQ-1 in AR F877L-expressing CRPC models. We determined that JQ-1 suppressed androgen or enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR and suppressed growth of mutant F877L AR CRPC tumors in vivo, demonstrating a new strategy to treat tumors harboring this mutation.""","""['Daniel J Coleman', 'Kathryn Van Hook', 'Carly J King', 'Jacob Schwartzman', 'Robert Lisac', 'Joshua Urrutia', 'Archana Sehrawat', 'Josha Woodward', 'Nicholas J Wang', 'Roman Gulati', 'George V Thomas', 'Tomasz M Beer', 'Martin Gleave', 'James E Korkola', 'Lina Gao', 'Laura M Heiser', 'Joshi J Alumkal']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'The Effect of F877L and T878A Mutations on Androgen Receptor Response to Enzalutamide.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-apoptotic function of caspase-8 confers prostate cancer enzalutamide resistance via NF-κB activation.', 'Identification of Genes Required for Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Assessment of STAT5 as a potential therapy target in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibition blocks the function of a critical AR-independent master regulator network in lethal prostate cancer.']"""

One molecular mechanism that regulates access to genetic information includes recognition of histone modifications, which is carried out by protein modules that interact with chromatin and serve as landing pads for enzymatic activities that regulate gene expression. The ING3 tumor suppressor protein contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) that reads the epigenetic code via recognition of histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and this domain is lost or mutated in various human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms targeting ING3 to histones and the role of this interaction in the cell remain elusive. Thus, we employed biochemical and structural biology approaches to investigate the interaction of the ING3 PHD finger (ING3PHD) with the active transcription mark H3K4me3. Our results demonstrate that association of the ING3PHD with H3K4me3 is in the sub-micromolar range (KD ranging between 0.63 and 0.93 μm) and is about 200-fold stronger than with the unmodified histone H3. NMR and computational studies revealed an aromatic cage composed of Tyr-362, Ser-369, and Trp-385 that accommodate the tri-methylated side chain of H3K4. Mutational analysis confirmed the critical importance of Tyr-362 and Trp-385 in mediating the ING3PHD-H3K4me3 interaction. Finally, the biological relevance of ING3PHD-H3K4me3 binding was demonstrated by the failure of ING3PHD mutant proteins to enhance ING3-mediated DNA damage-dependent cell death. Together, our results reveal the molecular mechanism of H3K4me3 selection by the ING3PHD and suggest that this interaction is important for mediating ING3 tumor suppressive activities.""","""['Sophia Kim', 'Senthil Natesan', 'Gabriel Cornilescu', 'Samuel Carlson', 'Marco Tonelli', 'Urszula L McClurg', 'Olivier Binda', 'Craig N Robson', 'John L Markley', 'Stefan Balaz', 'Karen C Glass']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Molecular mechanism of histone H3K4me3 recognition by plant homeodomain of ING2.', 'ING2 PHD domain links histone H3 lysine 4 methylation to active gene repression.', 'Histone H3K4me3 binding is required for the DNA repair and apoptotic activities of ING1 tumor suppressor.', 'Structural insight into histone recognition by the ING PHD fingers.', 'The return of the INGs, histone mark sensors and phospholipid signaling effectors.', 'The chromatin reader protein ING5 is required for normal hematopoietic cell numbers in the fetal liver.', 'The TUDOR domain of SMN is an H3K79me1 histone mark reader.', 'SMA-linked SMN mutants prevent phase separation properties and SMN interactions with FMRP family members.', 'An in silico study of how histone tail conformation affects the binding affinity of ING family proteins.', 'Structural insight into ASH1L PHD finger recognizing methylated histone H3K4 and promoting cell growth in prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we unravel previously unrecognized interactions and crosstalk between Pim kinases and the Notch signaling pathway, with implications for both breast and prostate cancer. We identify Notch1 and Notch3, but not Notch2, as novel Pim substrates and demonstrate that for Notch1, the serine residue 2152 is phosphorylated by all three Pim family kinases. This target site is located in the second nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD), and is shown to be important for both nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of N1ICD.

One factor that has increased expression outside prostate tumors is hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1). To investigate HO-1 expression in more detail, we analyzed samples of tumor tissue and peritumoral normal prostate tissue from rats carrying cancers with different metastatic capacity, and human prostate cancer tissue samples from primary tumors and bone metastases. In rat prostate tumor samples, immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the main site of HO-1 synthesis was HO-1+ macrophages that accumulated in the tumor-bearing organ, and at the tumor-invasive front. Small metastatic tumors were considerably more effective in attracting HO-1+ macrophages than larger non-metastatic ones. In clinical samples, accumulation of HO-1+ macrophages was seen at the tumor invasive front, almost exclusively in high-grade tumors, and it correlated with the presence of bone metastases. HO-1+ macrophages, located at the tumor invasive front, were more abundant in bone metastases than in primary tumors. HO-1 expression in bone metastases was variable, and positively correlated with the expression of macrophage markers but negatively correlated with androgen receptor expression, suggesting that elevated HO-1 could be a marker for a subgroup of bone metastases. Together with another recent observation showing that selective knockout of HO-1 in macrophages reduced prostate tumor growth and metastatic capacity in animals, the results of this study suggest that extratumoral HO-1+ macrophages may have an important role in prostate cancer.""","""['Sofia Halin Bergström', 'Maria Nilsson', 'Hanibal Adamo', 'Elin Thysell', 'Emma Jernberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Anders Widmark', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Anders Bergh']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Heme oxygenase-1 in macrophages controls prostate cancer progression.', 'Critical role of endogenous heme oxygenase 1 as a tuner of the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expressing macrophages/microglial cells accumulate during oligodendroglioma progression.', 'A novel experimental heme oxygenase-1-targeted therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Effect of sex hormones on heme oxygenase expression in rat ventral prostate.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pin-Pointing the Key Hubs in the IFN-γ Pathway Responding to SARS-CoV-2 Infection.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Rat prostate tumors induce DNA synthesis in remote organs.', 'High Monocyte Count and Expression of S100A9 and S100A12 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Are Associated with Poor Outcome in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine these specific glycan structures in serum PSA to analyze their potential value as markers for discriminating between BPH and PCa of different aggressiveness. In the present work, we have established two methodologies to analyze the core fucosylation and the sialic acid linkage of PSA N-glycans in serum samples from BPH (29) and PCa (44) patients with different degrees of aggressiveness. We detected a significant decrease in the core fucose and an increase in the α2,3-sialic acid percentage of PSA in high-risk PCa that differentiated BPH and low-risk PCa from high-risk PCa patients. In particular, a cut-off value of 0.86 of the PSA core fucose ratio, could distinguish high-risk PCa patients from BPH with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with an AUC of 0.94. In the case of the α2,3-sialic acid percentage of PSA, the cut-off value of 30% discriminated between high-risk PCa and the group of BPH, low-, and intermediate-risk PCa with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 95.5%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.97.

Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) binding tracers have revolutionized the molecular imaging of this disease. The translation of these tracers into therapeutic applications is challenging because of high PSMA-associated kidney uptake. While both the tumor uptake and the uptake in the kidneys are PSMA-specific, the kidneys show a more rapid clearance than tumor lesions. Consequently, the potential of endoradiotherapeutic drugs targeting PSMA is highly dependent on a sustained retention in the tumor - ideally achieved by predominant internalization of the respective tracer. Previously, we were able to show that the pharmacokinetics of the tracers containing the Glu-urea-based binding motif can be further enhanced with a specifically designed linker. Here, we evaluate an eventual influence of the chelator moiety on the pharmacokinetics, including the tumor internalization. A series of tracers modified by different chelators were synthesized using solid phase chemistry. The conjugates were radiolabeled to evaluate the influence on the receptor binding affinity, the ligand-induced internalization and the biodistribution behavior. Competitive binding and internalization assays were performed on PSMA positive LNCaP cells and the biodistribution of the most promising compound was evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) in LNCaP-tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, conjugation of the different chelators did not cause significant differences: all compounds showed nanomolar binding affinities with only minor differences. PET imaging of the (68)Ga-labeled CHX-A''-DTPA conjugate revealed that the chelator moiety does not impair the specificity of tumor uptake when compared to the gold standard PSMA-617. However, strong differences of the internalization ratios caused by the chelator moiety were observed: differences in internalization between 15% and 65% were observed, with the CHX-A''-DTPA conjugate displaying the highest internalization ratio. A first-in-man PET/CT study proved the high tumor uptake of this (68)Ga-labeled PSMA-targeting compound. These data indicate that hydrophobic entities at the chelator mediate the internalization efficacy. Based on its specific tumor uptake in combination with its very high internalization ratio, the clinical performance of the chelator-conjugated Glu-urea-based PSMA inhibitors will be further elucidated.""","""['Till Wüstemann', 'Ulrike Bauder-Wüst', 'Martin Schäfer', 'Matthias Eder', 'Martina Benesova', 'Karin Leotta', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Walter Mier']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of a novel urea-based 68Ga-complex for imaging PSMA binding in tumor.', 'Effects of Linker Modification on Tumor-to-Kidney Contrast of 68Ga-Labeled PSMA-Targeted Imaging Probes.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeting Homodimer with an Optimized Linker for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel PSMA-Targeted Probe for NIRF-Guided Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy: Synthesis and Preclinical Validation.', 'Bn2DT3A, a Chelator for 68Ga Positron Emission Tomography: Hydroxide Coordination Increases Biological Stability of 68GaGa(Bn2DT3A)(OH).', 'Metamorphosis of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors.', 'PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer Therapy: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives.']"""

However, the pleiotropic functions of exosome-derived miRNAs on developing chemoresistance remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to construct potential networks of miRNAs, which derived from the exosome of chemoresistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells, with their known target genes using miRNA expression profiling and bioinformatic tools. Global miRNA expression profiles were measured by microarray. Twelve miRNAs were initially selected and validated by qRT-PCR. Known targets of deregulated miRNAs were utilized using DIANA-TarBase database v6.0. The incorporation of deregulated miRNAs and target genes into KEGG pathways were utilized using DIANA-mirPath software. To construct potential miRNA regulatory networks, the overlapping parts of miRNAs and their targer genes from the selected KEGG pathway 'PCa progression (hsa05215)' were visualized by Cytoscape software. We identified 29 deregulated miRNAs, including 19 upregulated and 10 downregulated, in exosome samples derived from two kinds of paclitaxel resistance PCa cells (PC3-TXR and DU145-TXR) compared with their parental cells (PC3 and DU145). The enrichment results of deregulated miRNAs and known target genes showed that a few pathways were correlated with several critical cell signaling pathways. We found that hub hsa-miR3176, -141-3p, -5004-5p, -16-5p, -3915, -488‑3p, -23c, -3673 and -3654 were potential targets to hub gene androgen receptor (AR) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Hub gene T-cell factors/lymphoid enhancer-binding factors 4 (TCF4) target genes were mainly regulated by hub hsa-miR-32-5, -141-3p, -606, -381 and -429.

Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a newly approved cytochrome-P450C17 inhibitor for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and few studies have evaluated PSA kinetics using AA so far. Results of a study evaluating PSA kinetics in the beginning of AA and enzalutamide responded chemotherapy-treated patients suggested different trends between the drugs. PSA kinetics of AA-treated patients has been reported using large datasets; however, no studies which have fully evaluated PSA kinetics in the beginning treatment. The present study aimed to assess the PSA kinetics and relationship between the PSA kinetics and PSA progression in chemotherapy-naïve and chemotherapy-treated mCRPC patients receiving AA.  Methods:   We used two Japanese phase II trial datasets: JPN-201, chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC (n = 48) and JPN-202, chemotherapy-treated mCRPC (n = 46). PSA kinetic parameters were calculated using actual PSA values measured every 4 weeks, and a subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of early PSA response on time to PSA progression (TTPP). In addition, we used a Cox proportional hazard model to investigate the influence of variables on TTPP.  Results:   PSA declined from week 4 but took more time to achieve nadir. PSA kinetic parameters were different between the datasets, mean time to PSA nadir was 5.3 ± 5.6 and 2.0 ± 3.4 months, and TTPP was 9.5 ± 7.4 and 3.8 ± 4.8 months in JPN-201 and JPN-202, respectively. In the subgroup analysis of week 4 PSA decline status, Kaplan-Meier curves for TTPP were similar between early responders and non-progression patients in JPN-201 (median, 9.2 vs. 6.5 months, respectively) but separated in JPN-202 (median, 3.7 vs. 1.9 months, respectively). According to univariate Cox regression analysis, achievement of PSA response (≥50 %) at week 12 was associated with TTPP in the both trials, but the hazard ratio of PSA decline (≥30 %) at week 4 was not significant in JPN-201.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that PSA kinetics were not comparable and early PSA response showed different association to TTPP according to prior history of chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy is able to improve the survival of CRPC patients. We previously found that NSC606985 (NSC), a highly water-soluble camptothecin analog, induced cell death in Pca cells via interaction with topoisomerase 1 and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. To further elucidate the role of NSC, we studied the effect of NSC on ER-stress and its association with NSC-induced cell death in Pca cells. NSC produced a time- and dose-dependent induction of GRP78, CHOP and XBP1s mRNA, and CHOP protein expression in Pca cells including DU145, indicating an activation of ER-stress. However, unlike conventional ER-stress in which GRP78 protein is increased, NSC produced a time- and dose-dependent U-shape change in GRP78 protein in DU145 cells. The NSC-induced decrease in GRP78 protein was blocked by protease inhibitors, N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucylnorleucinal (ALLN), a lysosomal protease inhibitor, and epoxomicin (EPO), a ubiquitin-protease inhibitor. ALLN, but not EPO, also partially inhibited NSC-induced cell death.

Moreover, knockdown of NSC induction of CHOP expression using a specific siRNA had no effect on NSC-induced cytochrome c release and NSC-induced cell death.

Our goal was to study the link between a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in the steroid pathway and accurate measurement of prostate volume in a cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Clinical and pathological data including prostate weight were obtained from 611 Caucasian patients with small volume, localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. Patients were genotyped for 90 SNPs located inside or nearby genes implicated in the steroid pathway (Sequenom iPLEX). Correlation between prostate weight and genotypes from each SNP was studied by analysis of covariance, adjusted on age and tumor stage. A Bonferroni correction was applied, and the SNPs implicated were then incorporated in a multivariable model.  Results and limitations:   Seven SNPs located in or nearby genes implicated in steroid hormone metabolism were significantly associated with prostate volume: HSD17B2 (rs1119933), ESR2 (rs8006145), SULT2B1 (rs279451), NQO1 (rs2917670), ESR1 (rs1569788), GSTP1 (rs1138272), and CYP19A1 (rs17523880). Significant association was maintained after multivariate analysis for four SNPs, indicating their independent association with prostate volume. The power of the association of each SNP with prostate volume was comparable to the effect of age. The strongest associations were found with variants in ESR1, ESR2, HSD17B2, and CYP19A1 genes, indicating a potential role of the estrogen signaling pathway in genesis of BPH.

The prostate consists of peripheral, central and transitional zone accounting for approximately 70%, 20% and 5% of the glandular substances. Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects the transitional zone and carcinoma of the prostate affects the peripheral zone. The glandular tissue consists of numerous acini with frequent internal papillae. Follicular epithelium is variable but predominantly columnar and either single-layered or pseudostratified. This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in Department of Anatomy, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh to find out the difference in number of acini of the prostate gland of Bangladeshi people in relation to age. The present study was performed on 67 postmortem human prostate gland collected from the morgue in the Department of Forensic Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College by non random purposive sampling technique. The specimens were collected from Bangladeshi cadaver of age ranging from 10 to 80 years. All the specimens were grouped into three categories: Group A (up to 18 years), Group B (19 to 45 years) and Group C (above 45 years) according to age. Dissection was performed following standard autopsy techniques. In the present study, total 60 slides were made for histological study from both central and peripheral zone of the prostate which were examined under low power objectives. The number of the acini of the prostate gland were counted and recorded. The mean number of the acini of the prostate gland was 16.45, 43.54 and 42.45 in Group A, B and C respectively in central zone and 30.08, 51.35 and 44.16 in Group A, B and C respectively in peripheral zone of the prostate. Variance analysis shows that mean differences were highly significant between Group A & B and Group C & A and non significant between Group B & C in central zone of the prostate. Mean differences were non significant among all three groups in peripheral zone of the prostate. The number of the acini of prostate gland was increased up to certain age limit but decreased in extreme age. In statistical analysis, differences between age groups were analyzed by using students unpaired 't' test.

The secondary aim was to assess the best timing for performing (11)C-choline PET/CT during BCR.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 9,632 (11)C-choline PET/CT scans performed in our institution for restaging PCa from January 2007 to June 2015. The inclusion criteria were: (1) proven PCa radically treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or with primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT); (2) PSA serum values available; (3) proven BCR (PSA >0.2 ng/mL after RP or PSA >2 ng/mL above the nadir after primary EBRT with rising PSA levels). Finally, 3,203 patients with recurrent PCa matching all the inclusion criteria were retrospectively enrolled and 4,426 scans were analysed.  Results:   Overall, 52.8 % of the (11)C-choline PET/CT scans (2,337/4,426) and 54.8 % of the patients (1,755/3,203) were positive. In 29.4 % of the scans, at least one distant finding was observed. The mean and median PSA values were, respectively, 4.9 and 2.1 ng/mL at the time of the scan (range 0.2 - 50 ng/mL). In our series, 995 scans were performed in patients with PSA levels between 1 and 2 ng/mL. In this subpopulation the positivity rate in the 995 scans was 44.7 %, with an incidence of distant findings of 19.2 % and an incidence of oligometastatic disease (one to three lesions) of 37.7 %. The absolute PSA value at the time of the scan and ongoing androgen deprivation therapy were associated with an increased probability of a positive (11)C-choline PET/CT scan (p < 0.0001). In the ROC analysis, a PSA value of 1.16 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value. In patients with a PSA value <1.16 ng/mL, 26.8 % of 1,426 (11)C-choline PET/CT scans were positive, with oligometastatic disease in 84.7 % of positive scans.  Conclusion:   In a large cohort of patients, the feasibility of (11)C-choline PET/CT for detecting the sites of metastatic disease in PCa patients with BCR was confirmed. The PSA level was the main predictor of a positive scan with 1.16 ng/mL as the optimal cut-off value.

Segmentation of the prostate from ultrasound images with weak boundaries widely exists in clinical applications. One of the most typical examples is the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Accurate segmentation of the prostate boundaries from ultrasound images plays an important role in many prostate-related applications such as the accurate placement of the biopsy needles, the assignment of the appropriate therapy in cancer treatment, and the measurement of the prostate volume.  Methods:   Ultrasound images of the prostate are usually corrupted with intensity inhomogeneities, weak boundaries, and unwanted edges, which make the segmentation of the prostate an inherently difficult task. Regarding to these difficulties, the authors introduce an active band term and an edge descriptor term in the modified level set energy functional. The active band term is to deal with intensity inhomogeneities and the edge descriptor term is to capture the weak boundaries or to rule out unwanted boundaries. The level set function of the proposed model is updated in a band region around the zero level set which the authors call it an active band. The active band restricts the authors' method to utilize the local image information in a banded region around the prostate contour. Compared to traditional level set methods, the average intensities inside∖outside the zero level set are only computed in this banded region. Thus, only pixels in the active band have influence on the evolution of the level set. For weak boundaries, they are hard to be distinguished by human eyes, but in local patches in the band region around prostate boundaries, they are easier to be detected. The authors incorporate an edge descriptor to calculate the total intensity variation in a local patch paralleled to the normal direction of the zero level set, which can detect weak boundaries and avoid unwanted edges in the ultrasound images.  Results:   The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated by experiments on real 3D volume images and 2D ultrasound images and comparisons with other approaches. Validation results on real 3D TRUS prostate images show that the authors' model can obtain a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 94.03% ± 1.50% and a sensitivity of 93.16% ± 2.30%. Experiments on 100 typical 2D ultrasound images show that the authors' method can obtain a sensitivity of 94.87% ± 1.85% and a DSC of 95.82% ± 2.23%. A reproducibility experiment is done to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model.  Conclusions:   As far as the authors know, prostate segmentation from ultrasound images with weak boundaries and unwanted edges is a difficult task. A novel method using level sets with active band and the intensity variation across edges is proposed in this paper. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and accurate.""","""['Xu Li', 'Chunming Li', 'Andriy Fedorov', 'Tina Kapur', 'Xiaoping Yang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Three-dimensional prostate segmentation using level set with shape constraint based on rotational slices for 3D end-firing TRUS guided biopsy.', 'Rotationally resliced 3D prostate TRUS segmentation using convex optimization with shape priors.', 'Weighted Level Set Evolution Based on Local Edge Features for Medical Image Segmentation.', 'A novel segmentation method for breast ultrasound images based on neutrosophic l-means clustering.', 'Dynamic Programming Based Segmentation in Biomedical Imaging.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Domain generalization for prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound images: A multi-center study.', ""A Study on Weak Edge Detection of COVID-19's CT Images Based on Histogram Equalization and Improved Canny Algorithm.""]"""

Methods:   A software tool was developed to interface with a VMAT research planning system, which enables the input and output of beam and machine parameters of VMAT plans. The SAM algorithm was used to modify multileaf collimator positions for each segment aperture based on the changes of the target from the planning (CT/MR) to daily image [CT/CBCT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]. The leaf travel distance was controlled for large shifts to prevent the increase of VMAT delivery time. The SAM algorithm was tested for 11 patient cases including prostate, pancreatic, and lung cancers. For each daily image set, three types of VMAT plans, image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) repositioning, SAM adaptive, and full-scope reoptimization plans, were generated and compared.  Results:   The SAM adaptive plans were found to have improved the plan quality in target and/or critical organs when compared to the IGRT repositioning plans and were comparable to the reoptimization plans based on the data of planning target volume (PTV)-V100 (volume covered by 100% of prescription dose).

The execution of the SAM algorithm takes less than 10 s using 16-CPU (2.6 GHz dual core) hardware.

Such approaches require, however, an accurate interindividual mapping of the anatomies and 3D dose distributions toward a common coordinate system. This step is challenging due to the high interindividual variability. In this paper, the authors propose a method designed for interindividual nonrigid registration of the rectum and dose mapping for population analysis.  Methods:   The method is based on the computation of a normalized structural description of the rectum using a Laplacian-based model. This description takes advantage of the tubular structure of the rectum and its centerline to be embedded in a nonrigid registration-based scheme. The performances of the method were evaluated on 30 individuals treated for prostate cancer in a leave-one-out cross validation.  Results:   Performance was measured using classical metrics (Dice score and Hausdorff distance), along with new metrics devised to better assess dose mapping in relation with structural deformation (dose-organ overlap). Considering these scores, the proposed method outperforms intensity-based and distance maps-based registration methods.  Conclusions:   The proposed method allows for accurately mapping interindividual 3D dose distributions toward a single anatomical template, opening the way for further voxelwise statistical analysis.""","""['Gaël Dréan', 'Oscar Acosta', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Antoine Simon', 'Renaud de Crevoisier', 'Pascal Haigron']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Quantifying cell migration distance as a contributing factor to the development of rectal toxicity after prostate radiotherapy.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'On feature extraction and classification in prostate cancer radiotherapy using tensor decompositions.', 'Consolidating risk estimates for radiation-induced complications in individual patient: late rectal toxicity.', 'Impact of dose and volume on rectal tolerance.', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.', 'Quantitative assessment of intra- and inter-modality deformable image registration of the heart, left ventricle, and thoracic aorta on longitudinal 4D-CT and MR images.', 'Radiation Pneumonitis in Thoracic Cancer Patients: Multi-Center Voxel-Based Analysis.', 'Anatomy-guided multimodal registration by learning segmentation without ground truth: Application to intraprocedural CBCT/MR liver segmentation and registration.', 'Planning With Patient-Specific Rectal Sub-Region Constraints Decreases Probability of Toxicity in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   131 patients affected by intermediate-risk PCa were treated with HyRT at the total dose of 54,75 Gy in 15 fraction plus 9 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were classified as favourable risk (FIR) if they had a single NCCN intermediate-risk factor (IRF), a Gleason score ≤3 + 4 = 7, and <50 % of biopsy cores containing cancer (PBCC). If these criteria were not met were classified as unfavourable risk (UIR). Univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards model were calculated for biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), the risk of local recurrence and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results:   After a median follow-up of 56.7 months (range 9.8 to 93.7 months), 11 patients (8.4 %) died, of whom 2 (1.5 %) for PCa. In the univariate analysis, Gleason score, PPBCs, IRFs and PSA at first follow-up were prognostic factors for bRFS and LF while Gleason score, PPBCs and PSA at first follow-up were significant predictor for MFS. In the multivariate analysis only the PSA at first follow-up resulted a prognostic factor for bRFS and MFS. Patients with a value of PSA at first follow-up <0.7 ng/mL respect to those with PSA ≥0,7 ng/mL had a 5y-bRFS of 93.3 % vs. 57.5 %, 5y-MFS of 99.0 % vs. 78.9 % and 5y-LF of 5.8 % vs. 38.3 %. Patients in the UIR PCa group with a PSA value <0.7 ng/mL at first follow-up had significant better bRFS, LF and MFS.

Identification of factors associated with this transition to metastatic disease is crucial for future therapies. One such factor is the SSX gene family, a family of cancer/testis antigens (CTA) transcription factors which have been shown to be aberrantly expressed in other cancers and associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We have previously shown that SSX expression in prostate cancers was restricted to metastatic tissue and not primary tumors. In this study, we have identified SSX2 as the predominant SSX family member expressed in prostate cancer, and found its expression in the peripheral blood of 19 of 54 (35%) prostate cancer patients, with expression restricted to circulating tumor cells, and in 7 of 15 (47%) metastatic cDNA samples. Further, we examined SSX2 function in prostate cancer through knockdown and overexpression in prostate cancer cell lines. While overexpression had little effect on morphology or gene transcript changes, knockdown of SSX2 resulted in an epithelial morphology, increased cell proliferation, increased expression of genes involved in focal adhesion, decreased anchorage independent growth, increased invasion, and increased tumorigenicity in vivo. We conclude from these findings that SSX2 expression in prostate cancer is not a driver of EMT, but is involved in processes associated with EMT including loss of focal adhesion that may be related to tumor cell dissemination.""","""['Jordan E Bloom', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Expression and immunotherapeutic targeting of the SSX family of cancer-testis antigens in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 promotes the tumorigenicity and metastasis of prostate cancer cells through regulation of the TIMP-1/MMP-9 expression.', 'Collapsin response mediator protein-1 (CRMP1) acts as an invasion and metastasis suppressor of prostate cancer via its suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and remodeling of actin cytoskeleton organization.', 'Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition and Circulating Tumor Cells in Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Role of epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'SSX addiction in melanoma propagates tumor growth and metastasis.', 'Long-term expression changes of immune-related genes in prostate cancer after radiotherapy.', 'Antitumor effect of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing MAGEA3 and SSX2 fusion proteins.', 'Trial watch: DNA-based vaccines for oncological indications.', 'Novel and divergent genes in the evolution of placental mammals.']"""

Among these, some malignant cancers such as oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor are often recognized as clinical problems because, despite their high frequencies, current treatments for these cancers may not always achieve satisfying outcomes. The absence of effective systemic therapies against these cancers leads researchers to investigate novel therapeutic modalities, including immunotherapy. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory receptor with immunosuppressive function. When it binds its ligands, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates activating signals from the T cell receptor, resulting in the inhibition of the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression has been reported in many human cancers and is considered an immune escape mechanism for cancers. In clinical trials, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced tumor regression for several malignancies, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, to assess the potential of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for canine cancer immunotherapy, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in various malignant cancers of dogs was performed. Here, we show that dog oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma expressed PD-L1, whereas some other types of cancer did not. In addition, PD-1 was highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from oral melanoma, showing that lymphocytes in this cancer type might have been functionally exhausted.

Aim:   To study the antitumor effects of terpinen-4-ol and its mechanism of action in prostate and GI malignancies, alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic and biological agents.  Methods:   Terpinen-4-ol was administrated alone or combined with standard chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, Tarceva) and biological agent (Cetuximab). It was also combined with humanized anti-CD24 mAbs (was developed by us). Killing effects were measured qualitatively by light microscopy and quantitatively using the MTT and FACS analysis, following treatment of colorectal, pancreatic, gastric and prostate cancer cells. Terpinen-4-ol effect on tumor development was evaluated in xenograft model.  Results:   Terpinen-4-ol induces a significant growth inhibition of colorectal, pancreatic, prostate and gastric cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (10-90% in 0.005-0.1%). Terpinen-4-ol and various anti-cancer agents (0.2μM oxaliplatin and 0.5μM fluorouracil) demonstrated a synergistic inhibitory effect (83% and 91%, respectively) on cancer cell proliferation. In KRAS mutated colorectal cancer cells, which are resistant to anti-EGFR therapy, combining of terpinen-4-ol with cetuximab (1 μM) resulted in impressive efficacy of 80-90% growth inhibition. Sub-toxic concentrations of terpinen-4-ol potentiate anti-CD24 mAb (150μg/ml)-induced growth inhibition (90%). Considerable reduction in tumor volume was seen following terpinen-4-ol (0.2%) treatment alone and with cetuximab (10mg/kg) (40% and 63%, respectively) as compare to the control group.  Conclusion:   Terpinen-4-ol significantly enhances the effect of several chemotherapeutic and biological agents. The possible molecular mechanism for its activity involves induction of cell-death rendering this compound as a potential anti-cancer drug alone and in combination in the treatment of numerous malignancies.

To study the epigenetic mechanisms underlying self-renewal, we isolated CSCs and non-CSCs from colon cancer (HT29, HRT18, HCT116), hepatoma (Hep3B), breast cancer (MCF7) and prostate cancer (ASPC) cell lines. In HT29 and HRT18 cells that show loss of IGF2 imprinting (LOI), IGF2 was biallelically expressed in the isolated CSCs. Surprisingly, we also found loss of IGF2 imprinting in CSCs derived from cell lines HCT116 and ASPC that overall demonstrate maintenance of IGF2 imprinting. Using chromatin conformation capture (3C), we found that intrachromosomal looping between the IGF2 promoters and the imprinting control region (ICR) was abrogated in CSCs, in parallel with loss of IGF2 imprinting in these CSCs. Loss of imprinting led to increased IGF2 expression in CSCs, which have a higher rate of colony formation and greater resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in vitro. These studies demonstrate that IGF2 LOI is a common feature in CSCs, even when the stem cells are derived from a cell line in which the general population of cells maintain IGF2 imprinting.

Historically speaking, Flocks et al first identified antigenic properties in prostate tissue in 1960. Then, Barnes et al detected immunologic characteristics in prostatic fluid in 1963. Hara et al characterized γ-semino-protein in semen in 1966, and it has been proven to be identical to PSA. Subsequently, Ablin et al independently reported the presence of precipitation antigens in the prostate in 1970. Wang et al purified the PSA in 1979, and Kuriyama et al first applied an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for PSA in 1980. However, the positive predictive value with a cutoff figure of 4.0 ng/mL appeared substantially low (∼30%). There are overdiagnoses and overtreatments for latent/low-risk PCa. Controversies exist in the PCa mortality-reducing effects of PSA screening between the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. For optimizing PCa screening, PSA-related items may require the following: 1) adjustment of the cutoff values according to age, as well as setting limits to age and screening intervals; 2) improving test performance using doubling time, density, and ratio of free: total PSA; and 3) fostering active surveillance for low-risk PCa with monitoring by PSA value.

Sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) has shown its potential as an anticancer therapy in numerous cancer types. In the present study, we attempted to assess the effect of SPB against PCa and whether this treatment was associated with the regulation of survivin.  Methods:   Two human PCa cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, were used in the present study. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was conducted to measure the proliferation of PCa cells incubated with SPB. The effect of SPB on the cell apoptosis, cell colony formation ability, and cell morphological change was also assessed. Transwell experiment and Western blotting assay were performed to determine the effect of SPB on the migration and invasion ability of both cell types. Moreover, the expression pattern of survivin and MAPK members in both cell types after the treatment of SPB was also detected. Additionally, an in vivo tumor formation assay was performed to evaluate the treatment potential of SPB against PCa.  Results:   We found that the viability of PCa cells was significantly inhibited by SPB treatment. As illustrated by flow cytometry, for DU145 cell line the average apoptotic rate of SPB-treated cells was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05); similar results were also seen for PC3 (P<0.05). SPB administration also attenuated the colony formation and migration abilities in both cell lines. The expression level of survivin in SPB-treated cells was significantly downregulated, while the phosphorylation of p-38 and ERK was enhanced. Furthermore, in vivo tumor formation of both cell lines was suppressed by SPB as well.  Conclusion:   The above results confirmed the potential of SPB as an effective therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of PCa. This amelioration might be due to the blockade of the survivin pathway.""","""['Yawen Xu', 'Shaobo Zheng', 'Binshen Chen', 'Yong Wen', 'Shanwen Zhu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Effect of sodium phenylbutyrate on the sensitivity of PC3/DTX-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.', 'Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway.', 'Sodium Phenylbutyrate Inhibits Tumor Growth and the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Evaluation of the anticancer and anti-metastasis effects of novel synthetic sodium channel blockers in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'TROAP regulates prostate cancer progression via the WNT3/survivin signalling pathways.', 'Collagen Remodeling along Cancer Progression Providing a Novel Opportunity for Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Salubrinal Exposes Anticancer Properties in Inflammatory Breast Cancer Cells by Manipulating the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway.']"""

It is re-activated during lung tumorigenesis and is essential for lung cancer cell proliferation. Signalling pathways/molecules that control WDR77 gene expression are unknown. Promoter mapping, gel shift assay and ChIP revealed that the WDR77 promoter contains bona fide response elements for E2F and GATA transcriptional factors as demonstrated in prostate cancer, lung cancer and erythroid cells, as well as in mouse lung tissues. The WDR77 promoter is transactivated by E2F1, E2F3, GATA1 and GATA6, but suppressed by E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 in prostate cancer PC3 cells. WDR77 expression is associated with E2F1, E2F3, GATA2 and GATA6 occupancy on the WDR77 gene, whereas, in contrast, E2F6, GATA1 and GATA3 occupancy is associated with the loss of WDR77 expression during erythroid maturation and lung development. More importantly, the loss of WDR77 expression that results from E2F and GATA switches is required for cellular differentiation of erythroid and lung epithelial cells. In contrast, lung cancer cells avoid post-mitotic differentiation by sustaining WDR77 expression.

Although androgen deprivation can initially lead to remission, the disease often progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is still reliant on androgen receptor (AR) signaling and is associated with a poor prognosis. Some success against CRPC has been achieved by drugs that target AR signaling, but secondary resistance invariably emerges, and new therapies are urgently needed. Recently, inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins have shown growth-inhibitory activity in preclinical models of CRPC. Here, we demonstrate that ARV-771, a small-molecule pan-BET degrader based on proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, demonstrates dramatically improved efficacy in cellular models of CRPC as compared with BET inhibition. Unlike BET inhibitors, ARV-771 results in suppression of both AR signaling and AR levels and leads to tumor regression in a CRPC mouse xenograft model.

Image guided techniques provide a solution to assess the patient set-up uncertainties and help determine the optimal planning target volume (PTV) margin to the clinical tumor volume (CTV).  Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate patient set-up errors along the three translational directions at different treatment sites such as the brain, the head and neck (H&N) and the prostate. A total of 60 patients' set-up error data was analysed to evaluate the systematic and random errors and the optimal CTV-PTV margin.  Results:   For brain and H&N sites, more than 90, 80 and about 100% of the total image acquisitions were less than 3 mm in lateral, longitudinal and vertical directions respectively. For the prostate cases, the frequency of patient set-up error to be less than 3 mm were 79.7, 75.6 and 80% in lateral, longitudinal and vertical directions respectively. About 0.6% had more than 7 mm error in the lateral and longitudinal directions for the prostate site.

The expression profile of PBX3 and PBX1 in prostate tissue was determined by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, the expression of PBX3 transcript variants was analyzed by RT-PCR, NanoString Technologies®, and by analyzing RNA sequence data. The potential of PBX3 to predict prognosis, either at mRNA or protein level, was studied in four independent cohorts. PBX3 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of normal prostate basal cells, while it showed cytosolic expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells. We detected four PBX3 transcript variants in prostate tissue. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that high PBX3 expression was associated with slower progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.18, 95% CI: 0.081-0.42, p values < 0.001).

It is also a protease expressed at high concentrations by the normal and malignant prostate. PSA is secreted as a zymogen (proPSA) with an inhibitory prodomain that must be removed for full activity. ProPSA variants, assumed to be inactive, are found in the blood of prostate cancer patients, and are indicative of poor clinical outcome. Despite the abundance of clinical reports, our understanding of PSA's enzymology is limited, in part due to a lack of appropriate experimental systems. We sought to develop a series of PSA-derived mutants that would help to enhance our understanding of the gene.  Methods:   Sixteen rPSA variants were generated and characterized by a variety of biochemical methods.  Results:   The wildtype cDNA (WT) provided the template for generating a panel of recombinants. These included variants that abolished removal of the prodomain (R24A), disabled its enzymatic activity (S213A), and/or facilitated a cell-based conversion to the active conformation (FR). The purified variants' proteolytic activity was examined using a fluorogenic substrate, known PSA-cleavable proteins, and physiologically relevant inhibitors. Upon demonstrating our successful generation and purification of the PSA variants, we characterized proPSA activity, describing cleavage of synthetic and biologic substrates, but not serum protease inhibitors. This finding was exploited in the development of a self-activating mutant (PSA_QY) that exhibited the greatest enzymatic activity of all the variants.  Conclusions:   The system described herein will prove useful for varied applications. ProPSA is partially functional with relatively high activity compared to the mature enzyme. In demonstrating the zymogen's intrinsic activity, we suggest that the proPSA in prostate cancer patient serum is not inert. This may have implications for our understanding of the disease.

This study reports (i) the histological features of prostate cancer treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide and inter-pathologist variance in identifying these features, and (ii) the effect of the novel androgen deprivation agents on residual cancer volume.  Methods:   We reviewed sections of prostatectomies from 37 patients treated with neoadjuvant agents and 22 untreated patients, tabulated the frequency of nine features of cancer (intact cancer glands, isolated cancer cells, poorly formed glands, cribriform architecture, clear spaces, intraductal carcinoma, solid sheets of cancer cells, prominent nucleoli, and previously described ABC grouping) and two features of benign glands (prominent basal cells and coalescent corpora amylacea). We used several methods, including a novel metric (visual grid system), to estimate residual tumor volume.  Results:   The most highly reproducible features were ABC grouping (κ = 0.56-0.7), presence of intraductal carcinoma (κ = 0.34-0.72), cribriform architecture (κ = 0.42-0.68), solid sheets of tumor cells (κ = 0.44-0.56), and coalescent corpora amylacea (κ = 0.4-0.54). Among poorly reproducible features were prominent nucleoli (κ = 0.03-0.11), clear spaces (κ = 0.05-0.07), and poorly formed cancer glands (κ = 0.02-0.1). Determination of tumor mass was excellent regardless of the method used-maximum tumor size (κ = 0.9-0.94), tumor area (κ = 0.94-0.96), and grid-based tumor cellularity (κ = 0.9).  Conclusions:   We propose using a set of parameters including maximum tumor size, tumor area/volume, cellularity, volume, and ABC grouping for evaluating radical prostatectomies post-neoadjuvant therapy.

The mechanism by which ERG contributes to prostate cancer initiation and progression remains largely unknown. Because ERG is a transcriptional activator, we reasoned that the target genes regulated by ERG could contribute to prostate cancer development.  Methods:   In a search for ERG target genes, we took advantage of published datasets from the MSKCC Prostate Oncogene Project, in which a comprehensive analysis was applied to define transcriptomes in 150 prostate tumors. We retrieved the mRNA expression dataset, split them based on ERG expression, and identified genes whose expression levels are associated with ERG mRNA levels.  Results:   mRNA expression levels of 21 genes were found to be significantly increased, while for one gene it was decreased in ERG-positive prostate tumors. Among them, the expression of TDRD1 was the most significantly increased in ERG-positive tumors. Among 131 primary prostate tumors which were primarily from European American patients, TDRD1 is over-expressed in 68% of samples, while ERG is overexpressed in 48% of samples, suggesting an additional ERG-independent mechanism of TDRD1 overexpression. In African American prostate tumors, TDRD1 mRNA is expressed in 44%, while ERG is expressed in 24% of samples. In normal tissues, TDRD1 mRNA is exclusively expressed in germ cells and its protein is also known as cancer/testis antigen 41.1 (CT41.1). We generated a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes human TDRD1 protein with high specificity and sensitivity. By Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, we demonstrate that TDRD1 protein is expressed in the majority of human prostate tumors, but not in normal prostate tissue. Finally, TDRD1 is not induced in the prostate of ERG overexpression transgenic mice, suggesting that such model does not fully recapitulate the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion-dependent human prostate cancer development.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest TDRD1 as a novel prostate cancer biomarker. As an ERG target gene, TDRD1 might play an important role in human prostate cancer development, and as a cancer/testis antigen, TDRD1 might have long-term potential to be a therapeutic target for prostate cancer immunotherapy.

Patients and methods:   A total of 29 patients with biochemical recurrence received a (68)Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT for restaging of disease, followed by 3D conformal radiotherapy of metastases or intensity-modulated radiation therapy of the prostate bed. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and imaging procedures served as the reference standard to assess the treatment efficacy.  Results:   PET/CT was positive in 96.6% of patients and revealed that 13.8% of patients had locally recurrent disease, 58.6% had isolated lymph node metastases, 20.7% had isolated bone metastases, and 3.4% showed lymph node metastases and a vertebral metastasis. The median follow-up was 8.3 months (range 3.0-17.3 months). The median PSA prior to radiotherapy was 1.47 ng/ml (range 0.52-32.01 ng/ml) and showed a statistically significant decrease to 0.58 ng/ml (range < 0.07 to 6.33 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Two patients (6.8%) developed progressive disease outside the radiation field after 12.0 and 12.7 months, yielding a local control rate of 100% at the median follow-up. No grade III acute toxicity or late toxicity grade II was observed. Only 2 patients (6.8%) reported persisting grade I diarrhoea according to the LENT-SOMA criteria 3 months after radiotherapy. Deterioration of the urinary or faecal continence was not observed.  Conclusion:   Preliminary results in the presented cohort suggest that radiotherapy based on (68)Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT yields effective local control and significant treatment response in terms of PSA levels in the absence of clinically important side effects.

Patients and methods:   From 2005-2009, 94 patients presenting with a stage pT3a N0 and microscopic positive resection margin were retrospectively analyzed after radical prostatectomy. Special attention was given to patients' outcome, the frequency of additive RT, and its efficacy.  Results:   Median follow-up was 80 months. A total of 71 patients had a negative postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (<0.07 ng/ml). Thirty-six of them did not experience any PSA relapse (subgroup 1). Fourteen of them received additive RT and during follow-up all 36 patients remained PSA negative. Of 71 initially PSA-negative patients, 35 had a biochemical relapse (subgroup 2); 28 patients underwent salvage RT. The median PSA value before salvage RT was 0.24 ng/ml and was subsequently negative (<0.07 ng/ml) in 23 patients after RT. Of the entire cohort, 23 patients had persisting PSA after surgery (subgroup 3). Of these, 18 patients received salvage RT at a median PSA level of 0.4 ng/ml. One patient in subgroup 1, 5 patients in subgroup 2, and 9 patients in subgroup 3 had ongoing androgen deprivation therapy.  Conclusion:   The present study of 94 pT3a N0 R1 prostate cancer patients provides insight into medical care of this patient cohort and underlines the need for additive RT for the majority of patients to achieve long-term biochemical control.

Methods:   We performed a molecular case study in which we studied mutation profiles of six tumor-associated HGPIN lesions in a single case of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive Gleason score 7 PCa that we had previously mapped for somatic mutations in adjacent Gleason patterns 3 and 4 foci, using microdissection and targeted deep-sequencing.  Results:   A total of 32 tumor-specific mutated sites were successfully amplified and sequenced, including 25 truncal mutations and 7 mutations that were specific to either the Gleason pattern 3 or pattern 4 foci. All six HGPIN foci shared the same tumor-specific TMPRSS2:ERG fusion breakpoint, establishing that they were all clonally related to the adjacent invasive tumor. Among the 32 gene targets mutated in the invasive tumor, only mutation of the OR2AP1 gene, a truncal mutation, was found in a single focus of HGPIN. The remaining gene targets that were successfully sequenced were wild-type in all other HGPIN foci.  Discussion:   This study demonstrates the feasibility of targeted mutation profiling of HGPIN lesions, which will be important to understand PCa tumorigenesis. The results in this case, showing a remarkable absence of truncal mutations in HGPIN lesions bearing the tumor-specific ERG fusion, indicate HGPIN lesions may be relatively stable genetically and argue against a stepwise clonal evolution model of HGPIN to PCa.

We aimed to identify a gene expression signature that jointly with clinical variables could improve upon the prediction of clinical recurrence after RP for patients with stage T2 PCa.  Methods:   The study population includes consented patients who underwent a radical retropubic prostatectomy (RP) and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection at the University of Southern California in the PSA-era (1988-2008). We used a nested case-control study of 187 organ-confined patients (pT2N0M0): 154 with no recurrence (""controls"") and 33 with clinical recurrence (""cases""). RNA was obtained from laser capture microdissected malignant glands representative of the overall Gleason score of each patient. Whole genome gene expression profiles (29,000 transcripts) were obtained using the Whole Genome DASL HT platform (Illumina, Inc). A gene expression signature of PCa clinical recurrence was identified using stability selection with elastic net regularized logistic regression. Three existing datasets generated with the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST array were used for validation: Mayo Clinic (MC, n = 545), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (SKCC, n = 150), and Erasmus Medical Center (EMC, n = 48). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were obtained using repeated fivefold cross-validation.  Results:   A 28-gene expression signature was identified that jointly with key clinical variables (age, Gleason score, pre-operative PSA level, and operation year) was predictive of clinical recurrence (AUC of clinical variables only was 0.67, AUC of clinical variables, and 28-gene signature was 0.99). The AUC of this gene signature fitted in each of the external datasets jointly with clinical variables was 0.75 (0.72-0.77) (MC), 0.90 (0.86-0.94) (MSKCC), and 0.82 (0.74-0.91) (EMC), whereas the AUC for clinical variables only in each dataset was 0.72 (0.70-0.74), 0.86 (0.82-0.91), and 0.76 (0.67-0.85), respectively.

One of the main challenges for registering MR images to TRUS images is how to estimate the TRUS-probe-induced prostate deformation that occurs during TRUS imaging. The combined statistical and biomechanical modeling approach shows promise for the adequate estimation of prostate deformation. However, the right setting of the biomechanical parameters is very crucial for realistic deformation modeling. We propose a patient-specific deformation model equipped with personalized biomechanical parameters obtained from shear wave elastography to reliably predict the prostate deformation during image-guided interventions. Using data acquired from a prostate phantom and twelve patients with suspected prostate cancer, we compared the prostate deformation model with and without patient-specific biomechanical parameters in terms of deformation estimation accuracy. The results show that the patient-specific deformation model possesses favorable model ability, and outperforms the model without patient-specific biomechanical parameters. The employment of the patient-specific biomechanical parameters obtained from elastography for deformation modeling shows promise for providing more precise deformation estimation in applications that use computer-assisted image-guided intervention systems.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Dong Ni', 'Jing Qin', 'Ming Xu', 'Xiaoyan Xie', 'Pheng-Ann Heng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Towards Personalized Statistical Deformable Model and Hybrid Point Matching for Robust MR-TRUS Registration.', 'Biomechanical modeling constrained surface-based image registration for prostate MR guided TRUS biopsy.', 'Technique for a hybrid system of real-time transrectal ultrasound with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the guidance of targeted prostate biopsy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Biomechanical modelling of the pelvic system: improving the accuracy of the location of neoplasms in MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Computer simulations suggest that prostate enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia mechanically impedes prostate cancer growth.', 'Weakly-supervised convolutional neural networks for multimodal image registration.']"""

The intent was to gain a deeper understanding of patient circumstances and the related costs.  Methods:   Participant qualitative interviews were conducted in person during outpatient clinic visits or by telephone and were recorded between June 2011 and July 2012. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to a descriptive qualitative analysis. The research team collaborated early in the process (after three subjects were enrolled) to develop a preliminary coding framework. The coding framework was modified to incorporate additional emerging content until saturation of data was evident. Transcripts were coded using the qualitative software NVivo version 9.0.  Results:   Fifteen patients agreed to participate in the study and 14 completed the interview (seven breast, three colorectal, two lung, and two prostate). Consistent with existing published work, participants expressed concerns regarding expenses related to medications, complementary/alternative medicines, devices, parking and travel. These concerns were exacerbated if patients did not have insurance or lost insurance coverage due to loss of work. Although many acknowledged in hindsight that additional insurance would have helped, they also recognized that at the time of their diagnoses, it was not a viable option. Previously unidentified categorical costs identified in this study included modifications to housing arrangements or renovations, special clothing, fitness costs and the impact of an altered diet.  Conclusion:   We confirmed the results of earlier Canadian quantitative work. Additionally, cost categories not previously explored were identified, which will facilitate the development of an improved and more comprehensive quantitative questionnaire for future research.

Microscopic observation of subconfluent cells demonstrated two distinct cellular morphologies: polygonal closely aggregated epithelial cells surrounded by bipolar fibroblastic cells with long processes. This study sought to establish and characterize a fibroblast-free derivative of the CWR-R1 cell line.  Methods:   The CWR-R1ca cell line was established from CWR-R1 cells by removing fibroblasts using multiple cycles of short-term trypsinization, cloning, and pooling single-cell colonies. Authentication of fibroblast-free CWR-R1ca cells was demonstrated by analyzing the expression of cytodifferentiation and prostate-associated markers, DNA and cytogenetic profiling, and growth pattern in the absence or presence of androgen.  Results:   CWR-R1ca is an androgen-sensitive cell line that expresses the androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variant 7 and the luminal epithelia markers, CK-8, CK-18, and c-Met. CWR-R1fb fibroblasts isolated from CWR-R1 cells express AR, hepatocyte growth factor-α, and mouse β-actin but not AR-V7 or epithelial markers. Cytogenetic analysis of CWR-R1ca cells revealed a hyperdiploid male with numerical gains in chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12, deletion of one chromosome 2 allele, structural abnormalities that include der(1)t(1:4), der(4)t(2:4), der(10)t(4:10), and an unbalanced reciprocal translocation between chromosome 6 and 14. DNA-profiling revealed that CWR-R1ca cells had significant short-tandem repeat marker homology with CWR22Pc and CWR22Rv1 cell lines, which indicated lineage derivation from CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts. CWR-R1ca cells were responsive to the growth stimulatory effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the femtomolar range.  Conclusion:   This study establishes CWR-R1ca cells as a fibroblast-free derivative of the castration-recurrent CWR-R1 cell line.

This may result from combining indolent with aggressive disease in most studies. This study examined whether carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels were inversely associated with CaP aggressiveness.  Methods:   Data on African-American (AA, n = 1,023) and European-American (EA, n = 1,079) men with incident CaP from North Carolina and Louisiana were analyzed. Dietary carotenoid intake was assessed using a detailed-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and abdominal adipose tissue samples were analyzed for carotenoid concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography. Multivariable logistic regression was used in race-stratified analyses to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) comparing high aggressive CaP with low/intermediate aggressive CaP.  Results:   Carotenoid intake differed significantly between AAs and EAs, which included higher intake of lycopene among EAs and higher β-cryptoxanthin intake among AAs. Comparing the highest and lowest tertiles, dietary lycopene was associated inversely with high aggressive CaP among EAs (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.89, Ptrend = 0.02), while an inverse association was observed between dietary β-cryptoxanthin intake and high aggressive CaP among AAs (OR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.36-0.87, Ptrend = 0.01). Adipose tissue α-carotene and lycopene (cis + trans) concentrations were higher among EAs than AAs, and marginally significant inverse linear trends were observed for adipose α-carotene (Ptrend = 0.07) and lycopene (Ptrend = 0.11), and CaP aggressiveness among EAs only.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that diets high in lycopene and β-cryptoxanthin may protect against aggressive CaP among EAs and AAs, respectively.

IGRT using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in combination with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) potentially allows smaller treatment margins and dose escalation to the prostate. The aim of this study was to compare the difference of dosimetric diffusion in conventional IGRT using 7-field, step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hypofractionated IGRT using VMAT for patients with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We studied 24 patients who received 78 Gy in 39 daily fractions or 70 Gy in 28 daily fractions to their prostate with/without the seminal vesicles using IMRT (n = 12) or VMAT (n = 12) for prostate cancer between November 2013 and October 2015. Image guidance was performed using kilovoltage CBCT scans equipped on the linear accelerator. Offline planning was performed using the daily treatment images registered with simulation computed tomography (CT) images. A total of 212 IMRT plans in conventional cohort and 292 VMAT plans in hypofractionated cohort were enrolled in the study. Dose distributions were recalculated on CBCT images registered with the planning CT scanner.  Results:   Compared with 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT, VMAT plans resulted in improved planning target volume (PTV) D95% (7663.17 ± 69.57 cGy vs. 7789.17 ± 131.76 cGy, P < 0.001). VMAT reduced the rectal D25 (P < 0.001), D35 (P < 0.001), and D50 (P < 0.001), bladder V50 (P < 0.001), D25 (P = 0.002), D35 (P = 0.028), and D50 (P = 0.029). However, VMAT did not statistically significantly reduce the rectal V50, compared with 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT (25.02 ± 5.54% vs. 27.43 ± 8.79%, P = 0.087).  Conclusions:   To deliver the hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer, VMAT significantly increased PTV D95% dose and decreased the dose of radiation delivered to adjacent normal tissues comparing to 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT.

This study evaluated the PI-RADS diagnosis method in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <20 ng/ml.  Methods:   A total of 133 patients with PSA <20 ng/ml were prospectively recruited. T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance images of the prostate were acquired before a 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Each patient's peripheral zone was divided into six regions on the images; each region corresponded to two of the 12 biopsy cores. T2WI, DWI, and T2WI + DWI scores were computed according to PI-RADS. The diagnostic accuracy of the PI-RADS score was evaluated using histopathology of prostate biopsies as the reference standard.  Results:   PCa was histologically diagnosed in 169 (21.2%) regions. Increased PI-RADS score correlated positively with increased cancer detection rate. The cancer detection rate for scores 1 to 5 was 2.8%, 15.0%, 34.6%, 52.6%, and 88.9%, respectively, using T2WI and 12.0%, 20.2%, 48.0%, 85.7%, and 93.3%, respectively, using DWI. For T2WI + DWI, the cancer detection rate was 1.5% (score 2), 13.5% (scores 3-4), 41.3% (scores 5-6), 75.9% (scores 7-8), and 92.3% (scores 9-10). The area under the curve for cancer detection was 0.700 (T2WI), 0.735 (DWI) and 0.749 (T2WI + DWI). The sensitivity and specificity were 53.8% and 89.2%, respectively, when using scores 5-6 as the cutoff value for T2WI + DWI.

Some of the genes that are negatively regulated by miR-101 expression include histone methyltransferase EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), COX2 (cyclooxygenase-2), POMP (proteasome maturation protein), CERS6, STMN1, MCL-1 and ROCK2, among others. In the present study, we show that miR-101 targets transcriptional coactivator SUB1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)/PC4 (positive cofactor 4) and regulates its expression. SUB1 is known to have diverse role in vital cell processes such as DNA replication, repair and heterochromatinization. SUB1 is known to modulate transcription and acts as a mediator between the upstream activators and general transcription machinery. Expression profiling in several cancers revealed SUB1 overexpression, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. However, detailed regulation and function of SUB1 has not been elucidated. In this study, we show elevated expression of SUB1 in aggressive prostate cancer. Knockdown of SUB1 in prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Gene expression analyses coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that SUB1 binds to the promoter regions of several oncogenes such as PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1), C-MYC, serine-threonine kinase BUB1B and regulates their expression. Additionally, we observed SUB1 downregulated CDKN1B expression. PLK1 knockdown or use of PLK1 inhibitor can mitigate oncogenic function of SUB1 in benign prostate cancer cells. Thus, our study suggests that miR-101 loss results in increased SUB1 expression and subsequent activation of known oncogenes driving prostate cancer progression and metastasis.

AR complex formation by multiple transcription factors is important for enhancer activity and transcriptional regulation. However, the significance of such collaborative transcription factors has not been fully understood. In this study, we show that Oct1, an AR collaborative factor, coordinates genome-wide AR signaling for prostate cancer growth. Using global analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that Oct1 is recruited to AR-binding enhancer/promoter regions and facilitates androgen signaling. Moreover, a major target of AR/Oct1 complex, acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), contributes to tumor growth in nude mice, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Next, we examined the therapeutic effects of pyrrole-imidazole polyamides that target the Oct1-binding sequence identified in the center of the ACSL3 AR-binding site. We observed that treatment with Oct1 polyamide severely blocked the Oct1 binding at the ACSL3 enhancer responsible for its transcriptional activity and ACSL3 induction. In addition, Oct1 polyamides suppressed castration-resistant tumor growth and specifically repressed global Oct1 chromatin association and androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells, with few nonspecific effects on basal promoter activity.

Indeed, miR-375 potently inhibited invasion and migration of multiple prostate cancer lines. The transcription factor YAP1 was found to be a direct target of miR-375 in prostate cancer. Knockdown of YAP1 phenocopied miR-375 overexpression, and overexpression of YAP1 rescued anti-invasive effects mediated by miR-375. Furthermore, transcription of the miR-375 gene was shown to be directly repressed by the EMT transcription factor, ZEB1. Analysis of multiple patient cohorts provided evidence for this ZEB1-miR-375-YAP1 regulatory circuit in clinical samples. Despite its anti-invasive and anti-EMT capacities, plasma miR-375 was found to be correlated with circulating tumor cells in men with metastatic disease.

To realize the clinical potential of non-thermal plasma, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of plasma effects must be understood. This work aimed at studying the prostate cancer specific mechanisms of non-thermal plasma effects on energy metabolism as a central regulator of cell homeostasis and proliferation. It was found that cancer cells with higher metabolic rate initially are more resistant to plasma treated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) since the respiratory and calcium sensitive signaling systems were not responsive to plasma exposure. However, dramatic decline of cancer oxidative phosphorylation developed over time resulted in significant progression of cell lethality. The normal prostate cells with low metabolic activity immediately responded to plasma treated PBS by suppression of respiratory functions and sustained elevation of cytosolic calcium. However, over time the normal cells start recovering their mitochondria functions, proliferate and restore the cell population.

[(18)F]YC-88 was synthesized from 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl azide and the corresponding alkyne precursor in two steps using either a one- or two-pot procedure. Biodistribution and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were performed in immunocompromised mice using isogenic PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu xenografts. YC-88 exhibited high affinity for PSMA as evidenced by a Ki value of 12.9 nM. The non-decay corrected radiochemical yields of [(18)F]YC-88 averaged 14 ± 1% (n = 5). Specific radioactivities ranged from 320 to 2,460 Ci/mmol (12-91 GBq/μmol) with an average of 940 Ci/mmol (35 GBq/μmol, n = 5). In an immunocompromised mouse model, [(18)F]YC-88 clearly delineated PSMA(+) PC3 PIP prostate tumor xenografts on imaging with PET. At 1 h postinjection, 47.58 ± 5.19% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was evident within the PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor, with a ratio of 170:1 of uptake within PSMA(+) PC3 PIP to PSMA(-) PC3 flu tumor placed in the opposite flank. The tumor-to-kidney ratio at 2 h postinjection was 4:1. At or after 30 min postinjection, minimal nontarget tissue uptake of [(18)F]YC-88 was observed. Compared to [(18)F]DCFPyL, which is currently in clinical trials, the uptake of [(18)F]YC-88 within the kidney, liver, and spleen was significantly lower at all time-points studied. At 30 min and 1 h postinjection, salivary gland uptake of [(18)F]YC-88 was significantly less than that of [(18)F]DCFPyL. [(18)F]YC-88 is a new PSMA-targeted PET agent synthesized utilizing click chemistry that demonstrates high PSMA(+) tumor uptake in a xenograft model.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide a clear picture of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null deletion and risk of prostate cancer among different ethnic groups (i.e. Asians, Europeans, Americans, Africans and Eurasians). A systematic search was performed with the help of various search engines to find out the all the recent studies (2004 to 2015) evaluating the role of GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion in prostate cancer development. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of a total of 34 studies with 7,281 cases and 9,082 controls was analyzed using STATA and MedCalc software. Overall, GSTM1 deletion (OR 3.67; CI 1.39-9.85; P= 0.001) was strongly associated with prostatic cancer. In the sub group analysis GSTM1 null deletion was also significantly associated with prostate cancer among Asians (OR 4.84; CI 1.08-21.5; P= 0.03), Eurasians (OR 17.69; CI 9.87-31.70; <0.001) and Americans (OR 0.11; CI 0.01-1.06; P= 0.05).

We discovered that K(lysine) acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), a member of the MOZ, YBF2/SAS2, and TIP 60 protein 1 (MYST) family of histone acetyltransferases that catalyzes histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation, colocalized with WDR5 at AR target genes, resulting in hormone-dependent gene activation in prostate cancer cells. PKN1 or WDR5 knockdown severely inhibited KAT8 association with AR target genes and histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation upon androgen treatment. Knockdown of KAT8 significantly decreased AR target gene expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, these data describe a trans-histone modification pathway involving PKN1/histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation followed by WDR5/MLL histone methyltransferase and KAT8/histone acetyltransferase recruitment to effect androgen-dependent gene activation and prostate cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Ji-Young Kim', 'Jindan Yu', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir', 'Debabrata Chakravarti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'A role for WDR5 in integrating threonine 11 phosphorylation to lysine 4 methylation on histone H3 during androgen signaling and in prostate cancer.', 'Phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 11 establishes a novel chromatin mark for transcriptional regulation.', 'Phosphorylation of histone H3T6 by PKCbeta(I) controls demethylation at histone H3K4.', 'Histone Acetyltransferase MOF Orchestrates Outcomes at the Crossroad of Oncogenesis, DNA Damage Response, Proliferation, and Stem Cell Development.', 'MOF negatively regulates estrogen receptor α signaling via CUL4B-mediated protein degradation in breast cancer.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'WDR5-HOTTIP Histone Modifying Complex Regulates Neural Migration and Dendrite Polarity of Pyramidal Neurons via Reelin Signaling.', 'Upregulation of PKN1 as a Prognosis Biomarker for Endometrial Cancer.']"""

We investigated the association between ADT and the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease using a cohort of 31,842 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1988 and 2014, identified in the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Exposure to ADT was treated as a time-varying variable and lagged by 1 year to account for diagnostic delays, with nonuse as the reference category. During 133,018 person-years of follow-up, 48 men were newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (incidence rate (IR) = 36/100,000 person-years (PY)) and 12 were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (IR = 9/100,000 PY). In Cox proportional hazards models, ADT was associated with a decreased risk of ulcerative colitis (IR = 24/100,000 PY vs. IR = 50/100,000 PY; hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.99) and a nonsignificant decreased risk of Crohn's disease (hazard ratio = 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.11, 1.37).

Consequently, targeting the AR for degradation offers an alternate approach to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that carnosic acid, a benzenediol diterpene, binds the ligand-binding domain of the AR and degrades the AR via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated proteasomal degradative pathway. In vitro, carnosic acid treatment induced degradation of AR and decreased expression of prostate-specific antigen in human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1. Carnosic acid also promoted the expression of ER proteins including BiP and CHOP in a dose-dependent manner. Downregulation of CHOP by small interfering RNA somewhat restored expression of AR suggesting that AR degradation is dependent on ER stress pathway. Future studies will need to evaluate other aspects of the unfolded protein response pathway to characterize the regulation of AR degradation. Furthermore, cotreating cells individually with carnosic acid and proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) and carnosic acid and an ER stress modulator (salubrinal) restored protein levels of AR, suggesting that AR degradation is mediated by ER stress-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway. Degradation of AR and induction of CHOP protein were also evident in vivo along with a 53% reduction in growth of xenograft prostate cancer tumors. In addition, carnosic acid-induced ER stress in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells procured from patient biopsies. In conclusion, these data suggest that molecules such as carnosic acid could be further evaluated and optimized as a potential therapeutic alternative to target AR in prostate cancer.""","""['Sakina M Petiwala', 'Gongbo Li', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Daniel D Lantvit', 'Pavel A Petukhov', 'Jeremy J Johnson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Cytotoxicity of 11-epi-Sinulariolide Acetate Isolated from Cultured Soft Corals on HA22T Cells through the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.', 'Differential targeting of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors induces ER stress and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells: a novel therapeutic modality.', 'Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Research Progress of the Roles of Ubiquitination/Deubiquitination in Androgen Receptor Abnormalities and Prostate Cancer.', 'Divergent Modulation of Proteostasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Modern aspects of the use of natural polyphenols in tumor prevention and therapy.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'BCL9/STAT3 regulation of transcriptional enhancer networks promote DCIS progression.', 'Anticancer Effects of Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.)

Methods:   Data from 4795 hrPCa patients who underwent RP in two French university hospitals from 1991 to 2013 were analyzed. Subgroups were formed to determine whether an increasing number (1, 2 or 3) of criteria of tumor aggressiveness was associated with poorer oncological results and early biochemical recurrence (BCR) (PSA > 0.2 ng/ml). These results were compared using Fisher's exact test and BCR was compared according to the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Eight hundred fifteen patients were treated by RP for hrPCa (8 %). Four hundred eleven patients (79.5 %) presented 1 RF (Risk Factor), 93 (18.0 %) 2 RF and 13 (2.5 %) 3 RF. Lymph node invasion and positive margin rates were 12.4 and 44.1 %, respectively. The prognostic sub-stratification based on these 3 factors was significantly predictive for adverse pathologic features and for oncologic outcomes. BCR free survival was respectively 56.4, 27.06 and 18.46 % for 1RF, 2RF and 3RF (p < 0.0001). However, no predominant negative criterion was found.  Conclusion:   Oncologic results after RP are heterogenous within the hrPCa risk group. Sub-stratification based on three well-defined criteria leads to a better identification of the most aggressive cancers.

In present study, we found that miR-503 was significantly downregulated in advanced PCa tissues and cell lines. Downregulation of miR-503 was strongly associated with aggressive clinical-pathological features and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Ectopic expression of miR-503 significantly inhibited tumor cells growth, cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that ZNF217 was a direct target downstream target of miR-503. Knockdown of ZNF217 mimicked the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-503 overexpression on PCa invasion, whereas ZNF217 overexpression attenuated the tumor-suppressive function of miR-503. Subsequently, miR-503 further modulated the activation of ZNF217-downstream epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes. Besides, we also found that GATA3 directly increased miR-503 expression and thus decreased ZNF217 expression, indicating the involvement of GATA3/miR-503/ZNF217 signaling in EMT process.

Methods:   The free radical scavenger cysteamine was used to control the occurrence of sonochemical effects, and the ratios of cells with membrane damage to intact cells were compared in the presence and absence of cysteamine. To determine the optimal dose of cysteamine, free radical production on exposure to burst pulse ultrasound was investigated using KI-starch solutions with different concentrations (0-5 mM) of cysteamine. High-speed observation of the dynamic behavior of Levovist microbubbles during ultrasound exposure was also carried out in the presence and absence of cysteamine, and the difference in the ratios of the maximum bubble diameter to the initial diameter was evaluated. Next, human prostate cancer cells with adjacent Levovist microbubbles were exposed to single-shot pulsed ultrasound with a center frequency of 1 MHz, a peak negative pressure of 1.1 MPa, and a pulse width of 3 μs, and the percentages of cells with membrane damage were evaluated by fluorescent microscopy using propidium iodide in the presence and absence of cysteamine.  Results:   It was confirmed that cysteamine at a concentration of 5 mM completely suppressed sonochemical effects without causing a change in the dynamic response of microbubbles to pulsed ultrasound.

Methods:   One hundred twenty-six patients who received planar BS and PSMA PET within three months and without change of therapy were extracted from our database. Bone lesions were categorized into benign, metastatic, or equivocal by two experienced observers. A best valuable comparator (BVC) was defined based on BS, PET, additional imaging, and follow-up data. The cohort was further divided into clinical subgroups (primary staging, biochemical recurrence, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]). Additionally, subgroups of patients with less than 30 days delay between the two imaging procedures and with additional single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 75 of 126 patients were diagnosed with bone metastases. Sensitivities and specificities regarding overall bone involvement were 98.7-100 % and 88.2-100 % for PET, and 86.7-89.3 % and 60.8-96.1 % (p < 0.001) for BS, with ranges representing results for 'optimistic' or 'pessimistic' classification of equivocal lesions. Out of 1115 examined bone regions, 410 showed metastases. Region-based analysis revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 98.8-99.0 % and 98.9-100 % for PET, and 82.4-86.6 % and 91.6-97.9 % (p < 0.001) for BS, respectively. PSMA PET also performed better in all subgroups, except patient-based analysis in mCRPC.  Conclusion:   Ga-PSMA PET outperforms planar BS for the detection of affected bone regions as well as determination of overall bone involvement in PC patients.

Objective:   To test the hypotheses that PCa incidence is higher and PCa mortality is lower in countries with higher socioeconomic development, and that temporal trends for PCa incidence have increased while mortality has decreased over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data on age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in 2012 were retrieved from the GLOBOCAN database. Temporal patterns were assessed for 36 countries using data obtained from Cancer incidence in five continents volumes I-X and the World Health Organization mortality database. Correlations between incidence or mortality rates and socioeconomic indicators (human development index [HDI] and gross domestic product [GDP]) were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The average annual percent change in PCa incidence and mortality in the most recent 10 yr according to join-point regression.  Results and limitations:   Reported PCa incidence rates varied more than 25-fold worldwide in 2012, with the highest incidence rates observed in Micronesia/Polynesia, the USA, and European countries. Mortality rates paralleled the incidence rates except for Africa, where PCa mortality rates were the highest. Countries with higher HDI (r=0.58) and per capita GDP (r=0.62) reported greater incidence rates. According to the most recent 10-yr temporal data available, most countries experienced increases in incidence, with sharp rises in incidence rates in Asia and Northern and Western Europe. A substantial reduction in mortality rates was reported in most countries, except in some Asian countries and Eastern Europe, where mortality increased. Data in regional registries could be underestimated.  Conclusions:   PCa incidence has increased while PCa mortality has decreased in most countries. The reported incidence was higher in countries with higher socioeconomic development.  Patient summary:   The incidence of prostate cancer has shown high variations geographically and over time, with smaller variations in mortality.""","""['Martin C S Wong', 'William B Goggins', 'Harry H X Wang', 'Franklin D H Fung', 'Colette Leung', 'Samuel Y S Wong', 'Chi Fai Ng', 'Joseph J Y Sung']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Incidence and mortality of lung cancer: global trends and association with socioeconomic status.', 'The global epidemiology of bladder cancer: a joinpoint regression analysis of its incidence and mortality trends and projection.', 'National economic and development indicators and international variation in prostate cancer incidence and mortality: an ecological analysis.', 'International variations and trends in renal cell carcinoma incidence and mortality.', 'Recent Global Patterns in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates.', 'AR activates YAP/TAZ differentially in prostate cancer.', 'Potential role of gut microbiota in prostate cancer: immunity, metabolites, pathways of action?', 'Changes of lower urinary tract function after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: An urodynamic follow-up within 1 year.', 'Global Burden of Prostate Cancer and Association with Socioeconomic Status, 1990-2019: A Systematic Analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study.', 'Baseline CTC Count as a Predictor of Long-Term Outcomes in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.']"""

Baseline and post-treatment circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts of ≥5 cells/7.5ml are associated with poor CRPC outcome.  Objective:   To determine the value of a ≥30% CTC decline as a treatment response indicator.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified patients with a baseline CTC count ≥5 cells/7.5ml and evaluable post-treatment CTC counts in two prospective trials.  Intervention:   Patients were treated in the COU-AA-301 (abiraterone after chemotherapy) and IMMC-38 (chemotherapy) trials.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The association between a ≥30% CTC decline after treatment and survival was evaluated using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models at three landmark time points (4, 8, and 12 wk). Model performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and c-indices.  Results:   Overall 486 patients (122 in IMMC-38 and 364 in COU-AA-301) had a CTC count ≥5 cells/7.5ml at baseline, with 440, 380, and 351 patients evaluable at 4, 8, and 12 wk, respectively. A 30% CTC decline was associated with increased survival at 4 wk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.56; p<0.001), 8 wk (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33-0.53; p<0.001), and 12 wk (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.3-0.5; p<0.001) in univariable and multivariable analyses. Stable CTC count (<30% fall or <30% increase) was not associated with a survival benefit when compared with increased CTC count. The association between a 30% CTC decline after treatment and survival was independent of baseline CTC count. CTC declines significantly improved the AUC at all time-points. Finally, in the COU-AA-301 trial, patients with CTC ≥5 cells/7.5ml and a 30% CTC decline had similar overall survival in both arms.  Conclusions:   A 30% CTC decline after treatment from an initial count ≥5 cells/7.5ml is independently associated with CRPC overall survival following abiraterone and chemotherapy, improving the performance of a multivariable model as early as 4 wk after treatment. This potential surrogate must now be prospectively evaluated.  Patient summary:   Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that can be detected in the blood of prostate cancer patients. We analyzed changes in CTCs after treatment with abiraterone and chemotherapy in two large clinical trials, and found that patients who have a decline in CTC count have a better survival outcome.""","""['David Lorente', 'David Olmos', 'Joaquin Mateo', 'Diletta Bianchini', 'George Seed', 'Martin Fleisher', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Penny Flohr', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Susana Miranda', 'Kurt Baeten', 'Arturo Molina', 'Thian Kheoh', 'Robert McCormack', 'Leon W M M Terstappen', 'Howard I Scher', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Circulating Tumor Cell Count as an Indicator of Treatment Benefit in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cell increase as a biomarker of disease progression in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with low baseline CTC counts.', 'Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Circulating Tumor Cells in a Phase 3 Study of Docetaxel and Prednisone with or without Lenalidomide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between mesenchymal circulating tumor cells and prognosis of urologic malignancies: a single-center retrospective analysis.', 'The potential of using circulating tumour cells and their gene expression to predict docetaxel response in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells are associated with histopathological growth patterns of colorectal cancer liver metastases.', 'Circulating miR-200 Family and CTCs in Metastatic Breast Cancer before, during, and after a New Line of Systemic Treatment.']"""

Thus, conservative therapies including active surveillance may be wrongfully applied. The purposes were to assess the rate of upstaging in a contemporary cohort of D'Amico low-risk PCa patients and to develop and externally validate a nomogram as upstaging prediction tool in two European cohorts.  Methods:   Analyses were restricted to 2007 patients who harbored low-risk PCa at ≥10-cores initial biopsy according to D'Amico classification (PSA <10.0 ng/ml, Gleason score <7 and clinical stage ≤T2a). Patients underwent radical prostatectomy at a high-volume center in Hamburg, Germany, from 2010 to 2015. The Hamburg cohort was randomly divided into development (n = 1338) and validation cohorts (n = 669). The development cohort was used to devise a nomogram predicting upstaging, defined as presence of ≥pT3 and/or lymph node invasion. The nomogram was externally validated in two European validation cohorts (Hamburg, n = 669; Milan, n = 465).  Results:   Upstaging was observed in 187/1338 (14.0 %) of low-risk patients. In multivariable models, four of ten tested variables achieved independent predictor status: age (OR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.04-1.09), PSA (OR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.12-1.31), prostate volume (OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.96-0.98) and percentage of positive cores (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01-1.03). In external validation, the nomogram demonstrated 70.8 % (Hamburg) and 70.0 % (Milan) accuracy, respectively, with excellent concordance between predicted and observed values.  Conclusions:   Our proposed nomogram is capable to accurately identify D'Amico low-risk patients at risk of upstaging, utilizing four routinely available clinical variables, age, PSA, prostate volume and percentage of positive biopsy cores. Unfavorable prostate cancer disease at final pathology affects at least 10 % of D'Amico low-risk patients.

Methods:   We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65-79 years receiving radical prostatectomy (open or minimally invasive) or radiotherapy (brachytherapy or external beam) from 2001 to 2008 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology & End Results-Medicare linked databases. We assessed treatment-related hospitalizations. We analyzed the role of primary treatment on the number of complications per patient in each category using negative binomial regression.  Results:   Among 60,476 men, 14,492 underwent primary surgery and 45,984 underwent primary radiotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 5.6 years, the surgery group had significantly lower rates of hospital admissions (8.9 vs 20.3/1000 person-years) than the radiation group. For both groups, admissions peaked within 2 years of treatment, but continued at a steady rate for 10 years. After adjustment for confounders, patients treated with radiation had higher incidence of hospital admissions (relative rate [RR] = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-1.9, P < .0001), compared to those having surgery. Stratified analysis showed an increased rate of hospitalizations of 1 day and 2 or more days (RR 3.1, 95% CI: 2.7-3.7 and RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, respectively) for patients treated with radiotherapy. The use of adjuvant/salvage therapies significantly increased rates of hospitalization. The results were robust to analysis using propensity-score matching.

In the present study, we have evaluated the anti-tumoural effects of Sorafenib and Regorafenib on endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias. Both inhibitors reduced cell viability in vitro and lead to a disruption of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In vivo, we have demonstrated that Sorafenib and Regorafenib reduce thyroid hyperplasias induced by the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), although none of the treatments eliminated the disease.

Pharmacokinetic modeling of DCE-MRI data that extracts quantitative contrast reagent/tissue-specific model parameters is the most investigated method. One of the primary challenges in pharmacokinetic analysis of DCE-MRI data is accurate and reliable measurement of the arterial input function (AIF), which is the driving force behind all pharmacokinetics. Because of effects such as inflow and partial volume averaging, AIF measured from individual arteries sometimes require amplitude scaling for better representation of the blood contrast reagent (CR) concentration time-courses. Empirical approaches like blinded AIF estimation or reference tissue AIF derivation can be useful and practical, especially when there is no clearly visible blood vessel within the imaging field-of-view (FOV). Similarly, these approaches generally also require magnitude scaling of the derived AIF time-courses. Since the AIF varies among individuals even with the same CR injection protocol and the perfect scaling factor for reconstructing the ground truth AIF often remains unknown, variations in estimated pharmacokinetic parameters due to varying AIF scaling factors are of special interest. In this work, using simulated and real prostate cancer DCE-MRI data, we examined parameter variations associated with AIF scaling. Our results show that, for both the fast-exchange-limit (FXL) Tofts model and the water exchange sensitized fast-exchange-regime (FXR) model, the commonly fitted CR transfer constant (K(trans)) and the extravascular, extracellular volume fraction (ve) scale nearly proportionally with the AIF, whereas the FXR-specific unidirectional cellular water efflux rate constant, kio, and the CR intravasation rate constant, kep, are both AIF scaling insensitive. This indicates that, for DCE-MRI of prostate cancer and possibly other cancers, kio and kep may be more suitable imaging biomarkers for cross-platform, multicenter applications. Data from our limited study cohort show that kio correlates with Gleason scores, suggesting that it may be a useful biomarker for prostate cancer disease progression monitoring.""","""['Xin Li', 'Yu Cai', 'Brendan Moloney', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Wei Huang', 'Mark Woods', 'Fergus V Coakley', 'William D Rooney', 'Mark G Garzotto', 'Charles S Springer Jr']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Magn Reson""","""['The Impact of Arterial Input Function Determination Variations on Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pharmacokinetic Modeling: A Multicenter Data Analysis Challenge.', 'A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.', 'The Impact of Arterial Input Function Determination Variations on Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pharmacokinetic Modeling: A Multicenter Data Analysis Challenge, Part II.', 'Tracer-kinetic modeling of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and CT: a primer.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Arterial Input Function and Pharmacokinetic Models on DCE-MRI Biomarkers for Detection of Vascular Effect Induced by Stroma-Directed Drug in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Surrogate vascular input function measurements from the superior sagittal sinus are repeatable and provide tissue-validated kinetic parameters in brain DCE-MRI.', 'Assessing the reproducibility of high temporal and spatial resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with gliomas.', 'Operator dependency of arterial input function in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Pseudo Test-Retest Evaluation of Millimeter-Resolution Whole-Brain Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI in Patients with High-Grade Glioma.']"""

In this study, we characterized the serum autoantibody response to the RalA, Ras-like GTPase, in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). The autoantibodies were detected by immunofluorescence assay in PCa cell lines, ELISA, and immunoblotting in 339 serum samples from patients with PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and in normal human sera (NHS). The expression of RalA in prostate tumor tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor microarrays. The autoantibody level to RalA (median) in NHS was significantly lower than in PCa (0.053 vs 0.138; P < 0.001) and BPH (0.053 vs 0.132; P < 0.005) groups. The circulating anti-RalA autoantibody could distinguish PCa patients from normal individuals with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) performing at 0.861, with sensitivity of 52.9% and specificity of 91.0%. Elevation in serum immunoreactivity was observed in PCa patients after radical prostatectomy. The combined use of both anti-RalA autoantibody and PSA showed a significantly higher discriminatory ability compared with either of those markers alone. RalA protein expression was detected by IHC in 85.3% of tumor tissues from PCa patients, but without significant difference compared to BPH or normal control tissues. Together, our study shows the additional benefits of anti-RalA autoantibody as a potential serological biomarker for PCa, particularly in patients with normal PSA, and further demonstrate the utility of biomarker combinations in the immunodiagnosis of PCa.""","""['Jitian Li', 'Liping Dai', 'Ningjing Lei', 'Mengtao Xing', 'Pei Li', 'Chenglin Luo', 'Carlos A Casiano', 'Jian-Ying Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Preferential autoimmune response in prostate cancer to cyclin B1 in a panel of tumor-associated antigens.', 'Using Serological Proteome Analysis to Identify Serum Anti-Nucleophosmin 1 Autoantibody as a Potential Biomarker in European-American and African-American Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Using a panel of multiple tumor-associated antigens to enhance the autoantibody detection in the immunodiagnosis of ovarian cancer.', 'Biomarkers of prostate cancer and potential for using ace produced in prostate gland for diagnosis of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens as biomarkers in cancer immunodiagnosis.', 'The RAL Enigma: Distinct Roles of RALA and RALB in Cancer.', 'Research status and progress of the RNA or protein biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Chemokine CXCL3 mediates prostate cancer cells proliferation, migration and gene expression changes in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.', 'Ral signaling pathway in health and cancer.', 'Autoantibodies against oncogenic ERG protein in prostate cancer: potential use in diagnosis and prognosis in a panel with C-MYC, AMACR and HERV-K Gag.']"""

This activity depends on their cargo content that is largely defined by their cellular origin. Endometrial cells are fine regulators of the angiogenic process during the menstrual cycle that includes an angiostatic condition that is associated with the end of the cycle. Hence, we studied the angiogenic activity of menstrual stem cells (MenSCs)-secreted exosomes on prostate PC3 tumor cells. Our results showed that exosomes induce a reduction in VEGF secretion and NF-κB activity. Lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in exosomes-treated cells was detected by the DCF method, suggesting that the inhibition of the intracellular ROS impacts both NF-κB and VEGF pathways. We confirmed using tubule formation and plug transplantation assays that MenSCs-exosomes suppress the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors by the PC3 cells in a ROS-dependent manner. The inhibition of the tumor angiogenesis and, consequently, the tumor growth was also confirmed using a xenograft mouse model. Additionally, the anti-tumoral effect was associated with a reduction of tumor hemoglobin content, vascular density and inhibition of VEGF and HIF-1α expression. Importantly, we demonstrate that the exosomes anti-angiogenic effect is specific to the menstrual cell source, as bone marrow MSCs-derived exosomes showed an opposite effect on the VEGF and bFGF expression in tumor cells. Altogether, our results indicate that MenSCs-derived exosomes acts as blockers of the tumor-induced angiogenesis and therefore could be suitable for anti-cancer therapies.""","""['Francisca Alcayaga-Miranda', 'Paz L González', 'Alejandra Lopez-Verrilli', 'Manuel Varas-Godoy', 'Carolina Aguila-Díaz', 'Luis Contreras', 'Maroun Khoury']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-100 shuttled by mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes suppresses in vitro angiogenesis through modulating the mTOR/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling axis in breast cancer cells.', 'Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells induced by inflammatory cytokines produce angiogenetic factors and promote prostate cancer growth.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes from different sources selectively promote neuritic outgrowth.', 'Exosomes in Angiogenesis and Anti-angiogenic Therapy in Cancers.', 'MicroRNAs in tumor angiogenesis.', 'Emerging Roles of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal-Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer Therapy.', 'Oral Administration as a Potential Alternative for the Delivery of Small Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells elicits Anti-PD1 immunotherapy by targeted delivery of CX3CL1.', 'Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell-derived exosomes and genitourinary cancers: A mini review.', 'Turning adversity into opportunity: Small extracellular vesicles as nanocarriers for tumor-associated macrophages re-education.']"""

Materials and methods:   Our study includes 98 men (62 study and 36 control). After three days of sexual abstinence, blood samples were drawn for the measurement of baseline PSA levels. Then the patients were told to ejaculate. One, 5, 24 and 72 hours after ejaculation, serum total (tPSA), free (fPSA) and complexed PSA (cPSA) levels were measured. Serum PSA sampling was performed at the same intervals in the control group without ejaculation.  Results:   The mean age in study and control groups patients were 59.03±0.99 years, 61.14±1.30 years, respectively. In the study group, changes in tPSA and fPSA levels after ejaculation were found statistically significant while changes in cPSA levels and f/tPSA ratios were not significant (p=0.016, p=0.0003, p=0.176, and p=0.173, respectively).

The changes in the number of patients exceeding the cutoff values after ejaculation were not statistically significant for tPSA, cPSA, and f/tPSA ratio.  Conclusions:   In this study, ejaculation increased tPSA and fPSA concentrations but it didn't have a significant effect on serum cPSA levels and f/tPSA ratios. However, recent ejaculation may affect the biopsy indication at least near cut off PSA values.

The survey asked demographic information and addressed access, accuracy, cost, and role of prostate MRI in clinical practice.  Results:   Our survey elicited 276 responses. Respondents felt that limited access and prohibitive cost of MP-MRI limits its use, 72% and 59% respectively. Academic urologists ordered more MP-MRI studies per year than those in private practice (43.3% vs. 21.1%; p<0.001). Urologists who performed more than 30 prostatectomies a year were more likely to feel that an MP-MRI would change their surgical approach (37.5% vs. 19.6%, p-value=0.002). Only 25% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that MP-MRI should be used in active surveillance. For patients with negative biopsies and elevated PSA, 39% reported MP-MRI to be very useful.  Conclusions:   Our study found that MP-MRI use is most prominent among practitioners who are oncology fellowship-trained, practice at academic centers, and perform more than 30 prostatectomies per year.

The most common gene rearrangement in prostate cancer is the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, which results in aberrant expression of the transcription factor ERG. The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) plays a key role in cell growth and tumorigenesis, and is overexpressed in most malignancies, including prostate cancer. In this study we show that TMPRSS2-ERG mediates its tumorigenic effects through regulation of IGF1R gene expression. Silencing of T-ERG in VCaP cells resulted in downregulation of both IGF1R and Sp1, a critical IGF1R regulator. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a physical interaction between transcription factors ERG and Sp1, with potential relevance in IGF1R gene regulation. In addition, transactivation of the IGF1R gene by ERG was mediated at the level of transcription, as indicated by results of promoter assays. To identify new co-activators of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein we performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Among other interactors, we identified AP-2 complex subunit mu (AP2M1) and caveolin-1 (CAV1) in association with ERG in cell nuclei. These proteins play a mechanistic role in IGF1R internalization. Our analyses are consistent with a potential novel function of TMPRSS2-ERG as a major regulator of IGF1R gene expression.

Here we investigated the role of CD47 expression in tumor stroma in tumorigenesis by comparing tumor growth in wild-type (WT) and CD47-deficient mice after subcutaneous injection of syngeneic prostate cancer cells. We found that CD47 deficiency in tumor stromal endothelial cells enhances angiogenesis, leading to suppressed tumor necrosis formation and accelerated tumor progression.

Moreover, reduced macrophage recruitment, likely due to decreased TSP1 production, was detected in tumors from CD47-deficient mice. Our results indicate that although treatment with antibody against CD47 induces antitumor immune responses by blocking the inhibitory CD47-SIRPα signaling, this treatment may also potentially promote tumor progression by blocking CD47 signaling in tumor stromal endothelial cells.""","""['Lu Gao', 'Kexin Chen', 'Qi Gao', 'Xiaodan Wang', 'Jian Sun', 'Yong-Guang Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['TSP1-CD47-SIRPα signaling facilitates the development of endometriosis by mediating the survival of ectopic endometrium.', 'A function-blocking CD47 antibody suppresses stem cell and EGF signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Exosome-SIRPα, a CD47 blockade increases cancer cell phagocytosis.', 'The CD47-SIRPα signalling system: its physiological roles and therapeutic application.', 'The interaction between signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and CD47: structure, function, and therapeutic target.', 'Combining Multikinase Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Targeting the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Cluster of Differentiation 47 Signaling Pathways Is Predicted to Increase the Efficacy of Antiangiogenic Combination Therapies.', 'Immunotargeting of Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Roles of TSP1-CD47 signaling pathway in senescence of endothelial cells: cell cycle, inflammation and metabolism.', 'CD47 and CD68 expression in breast cancer is associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, blood vessel invasion, detection mode, and prognosis.', 'CD47 cross-dressing by extracellular vesicles expressing CD47 inhibits phagocytosis without transmitting cell death signals.']"""

Current systemic treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer only produce modest increases in survival time and self-renewing Tumor-Initiating Cells (TICs) are suspected to play an important role in resistance to these treatments. However it remains unclear whether the same TICs display both chemo-resistance and self-renewing abilities throughout progression from early stage lesions to late, castration resistant tumors. Here, we found that treatment of mice bearing LNCaP-derived xenograft tumors with cytotoxic (docetaxel) and anti-androgen (flutamide) compounds enriched for cells that express TROP2, a putative TIC marker. Consistent with a tumor-initiating role, TROP2high cells from androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines displayed an enhanced ability to re-grow in culture following treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy with or without androgen blockade. TROP2 down-regulation in these cells reduced their ability to recur after treatment with docetaxel, in the presence or absence of flutamide. Accordingly, in silico analysis of published clinical data revealed that prostate cancer patients with poor prognosis exhibit significantly elevated TROP2 expression level compared to low-risk patients, particularly in the case of patients diagnosed with early stage tumors. In contrast, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, TROP2high cells did not exhibit a differential treatment response but were characterized by their high self-renewal ability. Based on these findings we propose that high TROP2 expression identifies distinct cell sub-populations in androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent prostate tumors and that it may be a predictive biomarker for prostate cancer treatment response in androgen-sensitive tumors.""","""['Jinhan Xie', 'Christina Mølck', 'Sophie Paquet-Fifield', 'Lisa Butler;Australian Prostate Cancer Bioresource;Erica Sloan', 'Sabatino Ventura', 'Frédéric Hollande']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Trop2 is a driver of metastatic prostate cancer with neuroendocrine phenotype via PARP1.', 'BMI-1 Targeting Interferes with Patient-Derived Tumor-Initiating Cell Survival and Tumor Growth in Prostate Cancer.', 'Amplification of MUC1 in prostate cancer metastasis and CRPC development.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving Taxane-Based Chemotherapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 phosphorylation triggered by binding of galectin-3 drives metastasis through down-regulation of E-cadherin.', 'TROP2 modulates the progression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'The role of Trop2 in prostate cancer: an oncogene, biomarker, and therapeutic target.', 'Trop2: Jack of All Trades, Master of None.', 'Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) phosphorylation by protein kinase C α/δ (PKCα/δ) enhances cell motility.']"""

AGR2 functions as a protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, AGR2 is secreted by cancer cells that overexpress this molecule. Secretion of AGR2 was also found in salamander limb regeneration. Due to its ubiquity, tumor secretion of AGR2 must serve an important role in cancer, yet its molecular function is largely unknown. This study examined the effect of cancer-secreted AGR2 on normal cells. Prostate stromal cells were cultured, and tissue digestion media containing AGR2 prepared from prostate primary cancer 10-076 CP and adenocarcinoma LuCaP 70CR xenograft were added. The control were tissue digestion media containing no AGR2 prepared from benign prostate 10-076 NP and small cell carcinoma LuCaP 145.1 xenograft. In the presence of tumor-secreted AGR2, the stromal cells were found to undergo programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by formation of cellular blebs, cell shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation as seen when the stromal cells were UV irradiated or treated by a pro-apoptotic drug. PCD could be prevented with the addition of the monoclonal AGR2-neutralizing antibody P3A5. DNA microarray analysis of LuCaP 70CR media-treated vs. LuCaP 145.1 media-treated cells showed downregulation of the gene SAT1 as a major change in cells exposed to AGR2. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the array result. SAT1 encodes spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, which maintains intracellular polyamine levels. Abnormal polyamine metabolism as a result of altered SAT1 activity has an adverse effect on cells through the induction of PCD.""","""['Elizabeth A Vitello', 'Sue-Ing Quek', 'Heather Kincaid', 'Thomas Fuchs', 'Daniel J Crichton', 'Pamela Troisch', 'Alvin Y Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Development of an ELISA to detect the secreted prostate cancer biomarker AGR2 in voided urine.', 'Differential expression of anterior gradient gene AGR2 in prostate cancer.', 'Conversion of Prostate Adenocarcinoma to Small Cell Carcinoma-Like by Reprogramming.', 'Emerging roles for the pro-oncogenic anterior gradient-2 in cancer development.', 'The estrogen-regulated anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) protein in breast cancer: a potential drug target and biomarker.', 'AGR2: a secreted protein worthy of attention in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.', 'From development to cancer - an ever-increasing role of AGR2.', 'Secretion of pro-oncogenic AGR2 protein in cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA LINC00460 conduces to tumor growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-342-3p-dependent AGR2 up-regulation.', 'Associations of MACC1, AGR2, and KAI1 expression with the metastasis and prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

These allow adjustment of pelvic anatomical and functional relationships after removal of the prostate to ameliorate postprostatectomy incontinence (PPI) and reduce the time to complete continence.  Objectives:   To describe the results of a new surgical technique for reconstruction of vesicourethral anastomosis using the levator ani muscle for support during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, randomised, single-blind study among 66 consecutive patients with localised prostate cancer (cT1-2N0M0) undergoing RARP from June to September 2014, 32 using the new technique and 34 using the standard posterior reconstruction according to Rocco.  Surgical procedure:   In the advanced reconstruction of vesicourethral support (ARVUS) intervention group, the fibres of the levator ani muscle, Denonvilliers fascia, retrotrigonal layer, and median dorsal raphe were used to form the dorsal support for the urethrovesical anastomosis. Suture of the arcus tendineus to the bladder neck served as the anterior fixation.  Measurements:   We compared demographic data and preoperative and postoperative functional and oncologic results for the two groups. The primary endpoint was continence evaluated at different time points (24h, 2, 4, and 8 wk, and 6 and 12 mo). The secondary endpoints were perioperative and postoperative complications and erectile function.  Results and limitations:   Using a continence definition of 0 pads/d, the continence rates for the ARVUS versus the control group were 21.9% versus 5.9% at 24h (p=0.079), 43.8% versus 11.8% at 2 wk (p=0.005), 62.5% versus 14.7% at 4 wk (p<0.001), 68.8% versus 20.6% at 8 wk (p<0.001), 75.0% versus 44.1% at 6 mo (p=0.013), and 86.66% versus 61.29% at 12 mo (p=0.04). International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire results at 6 and 12 mo after surgery showed similar potency rates for the control group (40.0% and 73.33%) and the ARVUS group (38.8% and 72.22%). There were four postoperative complications (2 in each group): three haematomas requiring transfusion and one lymphocele that needed drainage. No urinary retention, anastomosis leak, or perineal pain was observed. Limitations include the small sample size and the single-institution design.  Conclusions:   The ARVUS technique yielded better urinary continence results than standard posterior reconstruction, with no negative impact on erectile function, complication rate, or oncologic outcome. External validation is warranted before clear recommendations can be made.  Patient summary:   We showed that postprostatectomy incontinence can be assuaged using a new technique for vesicourethral anastomosis reconstruction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). This could significantly improve the quality of life of patients after RARP.

This system measures the tissue bioimpedance over a range of frequencies (1 kHz to 1MHz), and computes a number of Composite Impedance Metrics (CIM). A classifier trained using CIM data can be used to classify tissue as benign or cancerous. The system was used to collect the impedance spectra from 14 excised prostates, which were obtained from men undergoing radical prostatectomy, for a total of 23 cancerous and 53 benign measurements. The data revealed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in the impedance properties of the benign and tumorous tissues, and among the measurements taken on the apical, base, and lateral surface of the prostate. Further, in the leave-one-patient-out cross validation, a maximum predictive accuracy of 90.79% was achieved by combining high frequency CIM phase data to train a support vector machine classifier with a radial basis function kernel.

Bleomycin was ceased for predefined clinical/radiological evidence of pulmonary toxicity and a >25% reduction in DLCO or FVC. We determined doses planned, received and omitted and patients receiving all, ≥two-thirds, two-thirds of planned bleomycin doses.  Results:   Of 43 eligible patients, 30% had lung metastases. Of 471, 375 (80%) of planned bleomycin doses were received, and 30% received <two-thirds of their planned doses, all for reductions in DLCO. No patient developed other evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Patients with lung metastases were 1.5 times as likely to have a >25% reduction in DLCO (35 vs 24%, P = 0.4) and 1.5 times as likely to receive <two-thirds of their planned doses (35 vs 24%, P = 0.4). Patients who received less than full doses of bleomycin had worse outcomes if they were of good or poor prognosis.  Conclusion:   Asymptomatic reductions in DLCO caused 20% of bleomycin doses to be omitted and 30% of patients to receive <two-thirds of their planned doses. A 25% reduction in DLCO appears too cautious a threshold. Given the potential negative impact of this practice on anti-cancer effect, routine use of PFT to monitor for bleomycin toxicity should be questioned.""","""['F T Roncolato', 'M Chatfield', 'B Houghton', 'G Toner', 'M Stockler', 'D Thomson', 'M Friedlander', 'H Gurney', 'M Rosenthal', 'P Grimison;Australian and New Zealand Urogenital Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP)']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Intern Med J""","""['Corrigendum.', 'Pulmonary Function in Patients With Germ Cell Cancer Treated With Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin.', 'Role of single-breath carbon monoxide-diffusing capacity in monitoring the pulmonary effects of bleomycin in germ cell tumor patients.', 'Accelerated BEP for metastatic germ cell tumours: a multicenter phase II trial by the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP).', 'Management of good risk germ-cell tumours.', 'Current Management of Disseminated Germ Cell Tumors.', 'A population-based study of pulmonary monitoring and toxicity for patients with testicular cancer treated with bleomycin.', 'Early diagnosis and treatment challenges of endodermal sinus tumors: A case report.', 'Prognostic impact of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity on the outcomes of patients with germ cell tumors.', 'Bilateral Lung Transplantation for Bleomycin-Associated Lung Injury.']"""

Urine of 14 PCa patients and 20 healthy volunteers was clarified by low-speed centrifugation and total extracellular vesicles fraction was obtain by high-speed centrifugation. The exosome-enriched fraction was obtained by filtration of total extracellular vesicles through a 0.1 μm pore filter. Transmission electron microscopy showed that cell-free urine in both groups contained vesicles from 20 to 230 nm. Immunogold staining after ultrafiltration demonstrated that 95% and 90% of extracellular vesicles in healthy individuals and cancer patients, respectively, were exosomes. Protein, DNA and RNA concentrations as well as size distribution of extracellular vesicles in both fractions were analyzed. Only 75% of the total protein content of extracellular vesicles was associated with exosomes which amounted to 90-95% of all vesicles. Median DNA concentrations in total extracellular vesicles and exosome-enriched fractions were 18 pg/ml and 2.6 pg/ml urine, correspondingly. Urine extracellular vesicles carried a population of RNA molecules 25 nt to 200 nt in concentration of no more than 290 pg/ml of urine. Additionally, concentrations of miR-19b, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-205 were quantified by qRT-PCR.

At our cancer center, 14 cancer survivors (breast, prostate and blood cancers) completed a four-session cognitive-behavioral stress program. The first session was delivered at the survivor's local cancer center, where they were provided with a loaner tablet. The three subsequent sessions were delivered through group-based videoconference on the tablet. Session content was supplemented with a tailored ebook, designed specifically for this program. Participants provided feedback about the program as well as a standardized measure of perceived stress.  Issues:   Despite evidence that psychosocial programs are effective, there are significant barriers to dissemination, particularly for those residing in rural areas who do not live near academic medical centers where such programming is more readily available. Our experiences delivering a group-based videoconference program in cancer survivors are described, including positives and challenges associated with its design and implementation.  Lessons learned:   Study participants enrolled from across four different US states, and the majority reported at least a 30-minute commute to their cancer center. This travel burden played a meaningful role in their desire to participate in our videoconference-based program. Although participants reported that session content was well suited to addressing stress management concerns, and session facilitators were able to effectively teach program techniques (eg progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive-reframing) and that the program was helpful overall, only modest improvements in perceived stress were seen. Participants noted challenges of the delivery including feeling disconnected from others, difficulty focusing, technical problems, and a desire for a longer program. Thus, although the novel delivery of a group-based, psychosocial program using tablet videoconference is feasible in a survivorship program, and desired by cancer survivors, key improvements must be made in future efforts. Our enthusiasm about the potential of telehealth must be tempered with the reality that such delivery can present challenges that interfere with the intervention implementation and efficacy. Facilitators must proactively address both the technological and interpersonal challenges associated with the use of group-based videoconference in order to improve its ability to positively impact cancer survivors. Many of these issues can be resolved prior to program launch, and require foresight and planning on the part of the program team.""","""['Eric S Zhou', 'Ann H Partridge', 'Jaime E Blackmon', 'Evan Morgan', 'Christopher J Recklitis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Rural Remote Health""","""[""Remote participants' experiences with a group-based stroke self-management program using videoconference technology."", 'A mindful self-compassion videoconference intervention for nationally recruited posttreatment young adult cancer survivors: feasibility, acceptability, and psychosocial outcomes.', 'A Pilot Study of a Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills Training Protocol for Patients With Persistent Cancer Pain.', 'Online psychosocial interventions for posttreatment cancer survivors: an international evidence review and update.', 'Overcoming Technological Challenges: Lessons Learned from a Telehealth Counseling Study.', 'Comparing the Feasibility and Acceptability of a Virtual Human, Teletherapy, and an e-Manual in Delivering a Stress Management Intervention to Distressed Adult Women: Pilot Study.', ""Adaptation of the trauma group intervention 'Teaching Recovery Techniques' for online delivery: A participatory design and usability study."", 'The Landscape of Connected Cancer Symptom Management in Rural America: A Narrative Review of Opportunities for Launching Connected Health Interventions.', 'A systematic review of behavioral interventions for rural breast cancer survivors.', 'Nuevo Amanecer-II: Results of a randomized controlled trial of a community-based participatory, peer-delivered stress management intervention for rural Latina breast cancer survivors.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 2011 and 2014, 24 patients with prostate cancer were treated with SBRT to the prostate gland and proximal seminal vesicles. A high-dose avoidance zone (HDAZ) was created by a 3-mm expansion around the rectum, urethra, and bladder. Patients were treated to a minimum dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, with a simultaneous dose escalation to a dose of 50 Gy to the target volume away from the HDAZ. Acute and late GU and GI toxicity outcomes were measured according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity scale, version 4.  Results:   The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 18-45 months). Nine patients (38%) experienced an acute grade 2 GU toxicity, which was medically managed, and no patients experienced an acute grade 2 GI toxicity. Two patients (8%) experienced late grade 2 GU toxicity, and 2 patients (8%) experienced late grade 2 GI toxicity. No acute or late grade ≥3 GU or GI toxicities were observed. The 24-month prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival outcome for all patients was 95.8% (95% confidence interval 75.6%-99.4%), and both biochemical failures occurred in patients with high-risk disease. All patients are currently alive at the time of this analysis and continue to be followed.  Conclusions:   A heterogeneous prostate SBRT planning technique with differential treatment volumes (low dose: 36.25 Gy; and high dose: 50 Gy) with an HDAZ provides a safe method of dose escalation. Favorable rates of biochemical control and acceptably low rates of acute and long-term GU and GI toxicity can be achieved in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer treated with SBRT.""","""['Rupesh Kotecha', 'Toufik Djemil', 'Rahul D Tendulkar', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'Richard A Thousand', 'Andrew Vassil', 'Mark Stovsky', 'Ryan K Berglund', 'Eric A Klein', 'Kevin L Stephans']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Early Tolerance and Tumor Control Outcomes with High-dose Ultrahypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Heterogenous Dose-escalated Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for All Risk Prostate Cancer: Quality of Life and Clinical Outcomes of an Institutional Pilot Study.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs. conventional radiotherapy in high risk prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Patients with Early-stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Toxicity, quality of life, and PSA control after 50 Gy stereotactic body radiation therapy to the dominant intraprostatic nodule with the use of a rectal spacer: results of a phase I/II study.', 'Overview of the current role of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the treatment of unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Local Failure after Prostate SBRT Predominantly Occurs in the PI-RADS 4 or 5 Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion.', 'Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to dominant intra-prostatic lesions during extreme hypofractionation for prostate cancer: the impact of rectal spacers.']"""

Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), an important deubiquitinating enzyme, was reported to be upregulated in several cancers, including liver, prostate and colon cancers. Membrane associated RING-CH protein 7 (MARCH7) belongs to the member of the E3 ubiquitin ligases. In addition, MARCH7 regulates T cell proliferation and the neuronal development and participates in the membrane trafficking and protein degradation. Importantly, MARCH7 itself is ubiquitinated and acts as a potential substrate of USP7. However, the roles of USP7 and MARCH7 in EOC remain to be investigated. We collected 121 EOC patients and analyzed the expression levels of USP7 and MARCH7 in tumor tissues with immunohistochemical staining. We found that the high expression of the two proteins was correlated with lymph node metastasis in EOC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the patients with high expression of the two proteins showed poorer prognosis compared with other patients. Subsequently, using SKOV3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, we showed that either USP7 or MARCH7 enhanced the proliferation and invasion abilities. Moreover, USP7 could regulate the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin through the MARCH7 signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that USP7 and MARCH7 are involved in the progression of EOC.

Despite recent advances in understanding prostate cancer heterogeneity, better methods for classification of prostate cancer are still needed to improve prognostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we computationally assembled a large virtual cohort (n = 1,321) of human prostate cancer transcriptome profiles from 38 distinct cohorts and, using pathway activation signatures of known relevance to prostate cancer, developed a novel classification system consisting of three distinct subtypes (named PCS1-3). We validated this subtyping scheme in 10 independent patient cohorts and 19 laboratory models of prostate cancer, including cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models. Analysis of subtype-specific gene expression patterns in independent datasets derived from luminal and basal cell models provides evidence that PCS1 and PCS2 tumors reflect luminal subtypes, while PCS3 represents a basal subtype. We show that PCS1 tumors progress more rapidly to metastatic disease in comparison with PCS2 or PCS3, including PSC1 tumors of low Gleason grade. To apply this finding clinically, we developed a 37-gene panel that accurately assigns individual tumors to one of the three PCS subtypes. This panel was also applied to circulating tumor cells (CTC) and provided evidence that PCS1 CTCs may reflect enzalutamide resistance. In summary, PCS subtyping may improve accuracy in predicting the likelihood of clinical progression and permit treatment stratification at early and late disease stages.

In a three-dimensional culture model, transfection of CEACAM1 into MCF7 breast cells can restore lumen formation by an unknown mechanism. ID4, a transcriptional regulator lacking a DNA binding domain, is highly up-regulated in CEACAM1-transfected MCF7 cells, and when down-regulated with RNAi, abrogates lumen formation. Conversely, when MCF7 cells, which fail to form lumena in a three-dimensional culture, are transfected with ID4, lumen formation is restored, demonstrating that ID4 may substitute for CEACAM1. After showing the ID4 promoter is hypermethylated in MCF7 cells but hypomethylated in MCF/CEACAM1 cells, ID4 expression was induced in MCF7 cells by agents affecting chromatin remodeling and methylation. Mechanistically, CaMK2D was up-regulated in CEACAM1-transfected cells, effecting phosphorylation of HDAC4 and its sequestration in the cytoplasm by the adaptor protein 14-3-3. CaMK2D also phosphorylates CEACAM1 on its cytoplasmic domain and mutation of these phosphorylation sites abrogates lumen formation. Thus, CEACAM1 is able to maintain the active transcription of ID4 by an epigenetic mechanism involving HDAC4 and CaMK2D, and the same kinase enables lumen formation by CEACAM1. Because ID4 can replace CEACAM1 in parental MCF7 cells, it must act downstream from CEACAM1 by inhibiting the activity of other transcription factors that would otherwise prevent lumen formation. This overall mechanism may be operative in other cancers, such as colon and prostate, where the down-regulation of CEACAM1 is observed.""","""['Tung Nguyen', 'John E Shively']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['miRNA-342 Regulates CEACAM1-induced Lumen Formation in a Three-dimensional Model of Mammary Gland Morphogenesis.', 'Phosphorylation of CEACAM1 molecule by calmodulin kinase IID in a three-dimensional model of mammary gland lumen formation.', 'ETS transcription factor ELF5 induces lumen formation in a 3D model of mammary morphogenesis and its expression is inhibited by Jak2 inhibitor TG101348.', 'Role of calpain-9 and PKC-delta in the apoptotic mechanism of lumen formation in CEACAM1 transfected breast epithelial cells.', 'Cell-cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 is expressed in normal breast and milk and associates with beta1 integrin in a 3D model of morphogenesis.', 'MicroRNA-135b/CAMK2D Axis Contribute to Malignant Progression of Gastric Cancer through EMT Process Remodeling.', 'Genome-wide association study of Stayability and Heifer Pregnancy in Red Angus cattle.', 'The role of CEA-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1) in vascular homeostasis.', 'miRNA-342 Regulates CEACAM1-induced Lumen Formation in a Three-dimensional Model of Mammary Gland Morphogenesis.']"""

Following docking-based studies on a homology model for the AR open antagonist conformation, a series of novel 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl compounds was designed with the aim to improve the antiproliferative activity of anti-androgen drugs bicalutamide and enzalutamide. The new structural modifications might impede the receptor to adopt its closed agonist conformation also in the presence of adaptive mutations. Among the novel compounds synthesised, several displayed significantly improved in vitro activity in comparison with the parent structures, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range against four different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, 22Rv1).

Recent works proposed that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are recruited to primary tumors. However, the exact functions of these cells in the tumor microenvironment are not well characterized, as it is reported that MSC can either promote or inhibit tumor progression. In the present study, we aim at investigating the signaling molecules which regulate the interplay between MSC, prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells and two important cellular types constituting the tumor-associated stroma, macrophages and fibroblasts, during their progression toward malignancy. We identified TGF-β1 as a crucial molecule able to attract MSC recruitment both to PCa cells as well as to tumor stroma components. Moreover, PCa- and tumor stroma-secreted TGF-β1 is important to induce MSC transdifferentiation into carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. Consequently, the CAF-like phenotype acquired by MSC is central to promote tumor progression related effects. Thus, tumor-educated MSC enhance PCa invasiveness compared to nonactivated MSC. Additionally, differing from normal MSC, CAF-like MSC perform vascular mimicry and recruit monocytes, which can be further polarized to M2 macrophages within the PCa environment. Our findings indicate a prominent role for TGF-β1 in MSC mobilization and activation strengthened by the fact that the blockade of TGF-β1 signaling impairs MSC promotion of PCa progression.

We conducted a retrospective analysis evaluating differences in toxicity based on the clinical state (i.e., mHSPC vs. mCRPC) that docetaxel was used. Patients initiating docetaxel between 1/1/2014 and 7/15/2015 were included, with the former date chosen to coincide with the press release for the first mHSPC study that showed a survival benefit with early docetaxel; ensuring contemporary docetaxel-treated cohorts. Thirty-nine mCRPC and 22 mHSPC patients were included. Compared to mCRPC, mHSPC patients were younger (median years: 66.3 vs. 71.8, P = 0.007); had better performance status (ECOG 0-1: 100 vs. 62 %, P < 0.0001); and used opiates less frequently (29 vs. 66 %, P = 0.04).

Methods:   From January 2006 to July 2010, 32 patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy underwent salvage cryoablation using third-generation technology. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was defined as the time period from salvage treatment to the date of biochemical recurrence (Phoenix definition of nadir +2 ng/ml). Complications were classified as grades 1-5 according to the modified Clavien system. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors associated with recurrence after salvage cryotherapy.  Results:   The median follow-up was 63 months (range 38-92). Mild complications (grades 1 and 2) included mild incontinence (9.4 %), acute rectal pain (31.3 %), hematuria (6.3 %), scrotal edema (9.4 %), urinary tract infection (3.1 %), lower urinary tract symptoms (15.6 %) and erectile dysfunction (57.1 %). Severe events (grade 3) included severe incontinence (3.1 %) and urethral sloughing (3.1 %). The rate of rectourethral fistula and urinary retention was absent. The 5-year overall survival was 92.3 %. The 5-year cancer-specific survival was 100 %. The 5-year BRFS rate using the Phoenix definition was 43.5 %. A multivariate analysis disclosed that PSA at cryoablation was the only predictive factor for biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Salvage cryotherapy using third-generation technology offers a safe and effective alternative for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy. Additional studies with longer follow-up are necessary to determine the sustained efficacy of this procedure.""","""['Huibo Lian', 'Rong Yang', 'Tingsheng Lin', 'Wei Wang', 'Gutian Zhang', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Salvage focal prostate cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Salvage cryotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radiation failure: a prospective case series of the first 100 patients.', 'Only carefully selected patients may have a beneficial effect of salvage cryoablation in recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy.', 'Salvage cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiotherapy.', 'Local tumor control with salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy.', 'Case report: Cryoablation as a novel bridging strategy prior to CAR-T cell therapy for B cell malignancies with bulky disease.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent progress in cryoablation cancer therapy and nanoparticles mediated cryoablation.', 'GETUG-AFU 31: a phase I/II multicentre study evaluating the safety and efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiation in patients with intraprostatic tumour recurrence after external radiation therapy-study protocol.', 'Xiaoyao Kangai Jieyu Fang, a Chinese Herbal Formulation, Ameliorates Cancer-Related Depression Concurrent with Breast Cancer in Mice via Promoting Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity.']"""

Initial empirical modeling showed that only baseline PSA correlated significantly with this biological response, whereas drug concentration did not. To identify the mechanistic cause of this observation, a mechanism-based model was first developed, which described the effects of AZD3514 on AR protein and PSA mRNA levels in LNCaP cells with and without dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

This is causing a high degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of otherwise clinically insignificant cases. As around half of all malignant PCa cases display a detectable gene fusion mutation between the TMPRSS2 promoter sequence and the ERG coding sequence (TMPRSS2:ERG) in urine, noninvasive screening of TMPRSS2:ERG mRNA in patient urine samples could improve the specificity of current PCa diagnosis. However, current gene fusion detection methodologies are largely dependent on RNA enzymatic amplification, which requires extensive sample manipulation, costly labels for detection, and is prone to bias/artifacts. Herein we introduce the first successful amplification-free electrochemical assay for direct detection of TMPRSS2:ERG mRNA in PCa urinary samples by selectively isolating and adsorbing TMPRSS2:ERG mRNA onto bare gold electrodes without requiring any surface modification. We demonstrated excellent limit-of-detection (10 cells) and specificity using PCa cell line models, and showcased clinical utility by accurately detecting TMPRSS2:ERG in a collection of 17 urinary samples obtained from PCa patients. Furthermore, these results were validated with the current gold standard reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach with 100% concordance.""","""['Kevin M Koo', 'Laura G Carrascosa', 'Muhammad J A Shiddiky', 'Matt Trau']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Colorimetric TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusion Detection in Prostate Cancer Urinary Samples via Recombinase Polymerase Amplification.', 'Noninvasive detection of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts in the urine of men with prostate cancer.', 'A simple, rapid, low-cost technique for naked-eye detection of urine-isolated TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion RNA.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Development of gold nanoparticle-based biosensors for COVID-19 diagnosis.', 'The Future of Biomarkers in Veterinary Medicine: Emerging Approaches and Associated Challenges.', 'Top-Down Fabricated Silicon Nanowire Arrays for Field-Effect Detection of Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Gold nanoparticles - an optical biosensor for RNA quantification for cancer and neurologic disorders diagnosis.', 'Epigenetically reprogrammed methylation landscape drives the DNA self-assembly and serves as a universal cancer biomarker.']"""

Our purpose was to determine if a baseline PSA level during midlife predicts lethal PCa in a US population with opportunistic screening.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study among men age 40 to 59 years who gave blood before random assignment in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and β-carotene among 22,071 US male physicians initiated in 1982 and then transitioned into a prospective cohort with 30 years of follow-up. Baseline PSA levels were available for 234 patients with PCa and 711 age-matched controls. Seventy-one participants who developed lethal PCa were rematched to 213 controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, with 95% CIs, of the association between baseline PSA and risk of lethal PCa.  Results:   Median PSA among controls was 0.68, 0.88, and 0.96 ng/mL for men age 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 59 years, respectively. Risk of lethal PCa was strongly associated with baseline PSA in midlife: odds ratios (95% CIs) comparing PSA in the > 90th percentile versus less than or equal to median were 8.7 (1.0 to 78.2) at 40 to 49 years, 12.6 (1.4 to 110.4) at 50 to 54 years, and 6.9 (2.5 to 19.1) at 55 to 59 years.

The first 10 patients had an additional magnetic resonance imaging after the completion of radiation treatment. SpaceOAR hydrogel was injected under general anaesthetic using a transperineal approach with transrectal ultrasound guidance. Primary end points were perioperative toxicity and comparison of rectal dosimetry. Secondary end points included cute and late radiation toxicity. All patients were planned on both pre- and post-hydrogel scans to a D95 of 80 Gy in 40 fractions.

Surgery, however, often can result in major side effects, which are caused from damage and removal of nerves and muscles surrounding the prostate. A technology that can help surgeons more precisely identify and remove prostate cancer resulting in a more complete prostatectomy is needed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II membrane antigen highly expressed in prostate cancer, has been an attractive target for imaging and therapy. The objective of this study is to develop low molecular weight PSMA-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents, which would provide image guidance for prostate tumor resection and allow for subsequent PDT to eliminate unresectable or remaining cancer cells. On the basis of our highly negatively charged, urea-based PSMA ligand PSMA-1, we synthesized two PSMA-targeting PDT conjugates named PSMA-1-Pc413 and PSMA-1-IR700. In in vitro cellular uptake experiments and in vivo animal imaging experiments, the two conjugates demonstrated selective and specific uptake in PSMA-positive PC3pip cells/tumors, but not in PSMA-negative PC3flu cells/tumors. Further in vivo photodynamic treatment proved that the two PSMA-1-PDT conjugates can effectively inhibit PC3pip tumor progression. The two PSMA-1-PDT conjugates reported here may have the potential to aid in the detection and resection of prostate cancers. It may also allow for the identification of unresectable cancer tissue and PDT ablation of such tissue after surgical resection with potentially less damage to surrounding tissues.

Recent reports showed that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, thereby, playing an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, we know that Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are random single pass sequence reads, which displays the condition/tissue specific transcripts (coding and non-coding) of an organism.  Methods:   In the present study, we have applied the bioinformatics approach to identify miRNA from prostate cancer using EST resource and its expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).  Results:   Analysis of transcriptomics resource from the LNCaP cells revealed the presence of an EST encoding hsa-miR-3654. Presence of the premature candidate of miR-3654, demonstrates its expression in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   We retrospectively analysed FCH-PET/CTs of 63 PCA patients. PET images were reconstructed using either neCT or ceCT for attenuation correction. Contrast-enhancement (HU) and mean and maximum standardised FDG uptake (SUVmean and SUVmax) were measured at eight anatomical sites, and PET images were evaluated for image quality and patient staging by two independent observers.  Results:   At all anatomical sites the HU values were significantly higher in the ceCT than in the neCT. This in turn led to increases in SUVmean and SUVmax that, although small in both absolute and relative terms, were highly consistent and thus statistically highly significant. However, assessment of the FCH-PET images reconstructed using either neCT or ceCT revealed no differences between observers or reconstructions with regard to patient staging (all κ = 1.0: excellent agreement; P = 1.0). Minor visual differences without clinical relevance were seen in 21 scans by observer 1 and in 22 scans by observer 2 (κ = 0.68, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   There is no clinically relevant difference between reconstruction of PET images based on ceCT or neCT in FCH-PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.

We tested this hypothesis in a prospective case-control study of 476 PCa cases and matched control subjects nested in the Physicians' Health Study. The previously reported associations between fatty acids and PCa in this cohort were dramatically stronger among men diagnosed 10 or more years after blood collection. Statistically significant effect modification by time since blood collection was identified for mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and was more pronounced for aggressive tumors. Among men diagnosed fewer than 10 years since blood collection, the relative risks per interquartile range were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86 to 1.25) for total mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 0.95 (95% CI = 0.78 to 1.15) for total poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) whereas among men diagnosed 10 or more years after blood draw the relative risks per interquartile range were 1.69 (95% CI = 1.21 to 2.34) for MUFA (Pheterogeneity = .01) and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.42 to 0.83) for PUFA (Pheterogeneity = .02).

It is a bi-functional enzyme, catalyzing production of glucocorticoid precursors by hydroxylation of pregnene-nucleus, and androgen biosynthesis by a second CC lyase step, at the expense of glucocorticoid production. Cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) is known to be a key regulator of the androgen synthesis reaction in vivo, by a mechanism that is not well understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism by which cyt b5 increases androgen biosynthesis. Cyt b5 could act as an allosteric effector, binding to CYP17A1 and either changing its selective substrate affinity or altering the conformation of the P450 to increase the catalytic rate or decrease unproductive uncoupling channels. Alternatively, cyt b5 could act as a redox donor for supply of the second electron in the P450 cycle, reducing the oxyferrous complex to form the reactive peroxo-intermediate. To understand the mechanism of lyase enhancement by cyt b5, we generated a redox-inactive form of cyt b5, in which the heme is replaced with a Manganese-protoporphyrin IX (Mn-b5), and investigated enhancement of androgen producing lyase reaction by CYP17A1. Given the critical significance of a stable membrane anchor for all of the proteins involved and the need for controlled stoichiometric ratios, we employed the Nanodisc system for this study. The redox inactive form was observed to have no effect on the lyase reaction, while reactions with the normal heme-iron containing cyt b5 were enhanced ∼5 fold as compared to reactions in the absence of cyt b5. We also performed resonance Raman measurements on ferric CYP17A1 bound to Mn-b5. Upon addition of Mn-b5 to Nanodisc reconstituted CYP17A1, we observed clear evidence for the formation of a b5-CYP17A1 complex, as noted by changes in the porphyrin modes and alteration in the proximal FeS vibrational frequency. Thus, although Mn-b5 binds to CYP17A1, it is unable to enhance the lyase reaction, strongly suggesting that cyt b5 has a redox effector role in enhancement of the CYP17A1 mediated lyase reaction necessary for androgen synthesis.""","""['Ruchia Duggal', 'Yilin Liu', 'Michael C Gregory', 'Ilia G Denisov', 'James R Kincaid', 'Stephen G Sligar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Cytochrome b5 enhances androgen synthesis by rapidly reducing the CYP17A1 oxy-complex in the lyase step.', 'Substrate-modulated cytochrome P450 17A1 and cytochrome b5 interactions revealed by NMR.', 'Role of cytochrome b5 in the modulation of the enzymatic activities of cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450 17A1).', 'Cytochrome b5 Activates the 17,20-Lyase Activity of Human Cytochrome P450 17A1 by Increasing the Coupling of NADPH Consumption to Androgen Production.', 'A Homodimer Model Can Resolve the Conundrum as to How Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase and Cytochrome b5 Compete for the Same Binding Site on Cytochrome P450c17.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1 structure and function.', 'Tight binding of cytochrome b5 to cytochrome P450 17A1 is a critical feature of stimulation of C21 steroid lyase activity and androgen synthesis.', 'Substrate-Specific Allosteric Effects on the Enhancement of CYP17A1 Lyase Efficiency by Cytochrome b5.', 'P450 CYP17A1 Variant with a Disordered Proton Shuttle Assembly Retains Peroxo-Mediated Lyase Efficiency.']"""

Further exfoliation by ultrasonication yielded the desired formation of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets. After comprehensive characterization, the synthesized MoS2 nanosheets were channeled in a field-effect transistor (FET) microdevice. Chemically reduced anti-PSA antibodies were immobilized on the MoS2 channel above the FET microdevice to construct a specific PSA immunosensor. The antibodies were deliberately reduced to expose the hinge-region disulfide bonds. This approach offered a robust and site-directed immunosensing device through biointerfacing of the sulfhydryl groups (-SH) in the reduced antibody with the surface S atoms of MoS2.

Disruption of the transcription factor RBPJ in Pten-null mice revealed that endogenous canonical Notch signaling is not required for disease initiation and progression. However, augmentation of Notch activity in this model promoted both proliferation and apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells, which collectively reduced the primary tumor burden. The increase in cellular apoptosis was linked to DNA damage-induced p53 activation. Despite a reduced primary tumor burden, Notch activation in Pten-null mice promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition and FOXC2-dependent tumor metastases but did not confer resistance to androgen deprivation.

A tissue microarray of 80 samples from prostate cancer patients or healthy controls was employed to examine the expression of HIF-1α and its correlation with SOX2. The role of SOX2 and HIF-1/2α in the regulation of cell invasion and sphere formation capacity under hypoxic conditions was investigated in vitro using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown in three human prostate cancer cell lines. HIF-1α expression was significantly elevated in malignant prostate tissue compared to benign or normal tissue, and in tumor samples its expression was highly correlated with SOX2. In prostate cancer cells, acute and chronic exposures to hypoxia that resulted in elevated expression levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, respectively, also induced SOX2. Genetic depletion of SOX2 attenuated hypoxia-induced cell functions. Knockdown of HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α, decreased acute hypoxia-mediated cell invasion and SOX2 up-regulation, whereas only HIF-2α gene silencing reduced sphere formation capacity and chronic hypoxia-mediated SOX2 up-regulation. Enhanced SOX2 expression and HIF-1α or HIF-2α associated phenotypes are dependent on the time duration of exposure to hypoxia. The present results indicate that SOX2 may be a key mediator of hypoxia-induced metastasis-associated functions and hence may serve as a potential target for therapeutic interventions for metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Kyung-Mi Bae', 'Yao Dai', 'Johannes Vieweg', 'Dietmar W Siemann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['The role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and -2α in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) mediates the effects of hypoxia on the promotion of HeLa cell viability, colony formation, and invasion capacity in vitro.', 'Opposite functions of HIF-α isoforms in VEGF induction by TGF-β1 under non-hypoxic conditions.', 'FAT1 modulates EMT and stemness genes expression in hypoxic glioblastoma.', 'YTHDC2 Promotes Malignant Phenotypes of Breast Cancer Cells.', 'TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis of spheroid cells of endometrial cancer possessing cancer stem cell properties.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Hypoxia-inducing cryogels uncover key cancer-immune cell interactions in an oxygen-deficient tumor microenvironment.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in gynecologic cancers: mechanisms and therapeutic targeting.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity and molecular targets of TBMS1 in human prostate cancer cells in vitro.  Methods:   DU145 and P3 human prostate cancer cells were treated with TBMS1. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected. ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle profile were examined. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of relevant proteins in the cells.  Results:   TBMS1 (5-100 μmol/L) significantly suppressed the viability of DU145 and P3 cells with IC50 values of approximately 10 and 20 μmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, TBMS1 dose-dependently induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in DU145 and P3 cells. In DU145 cells, TBMS1 induced mitochondrial apoptosis, evidenced by ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulated Bcl-2 family protein and cleaved caspase-3, and activated ASK-1 and its downstream targets p38 and JNK. The G0/G1 phase arrest was linked to increased expression of p53 and p21 and decreased expression of cyclin E and cdk2. Co-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) could attenuate TBMS1-induced apoptosis but did not prevent G0/G1 arrest. Moreover, co-treatment with NAC (ROS scavenger), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) or salubrinal (ER stress inhibitor) significantly attenuated TBMS1-induced apoptosis.

Patients and methods:   We designed a case series based on a sample of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer who had previously been diagnosed with cancer located outside the head and neck region. The primary predictor variable was a diagnosis of cancer outside the head and neck region. The primary outcome variable was the diagnosis of a second cancer in the head and neck region. χ2 Goodness-of-fit tests were used to test for differences between the observed and expected rates.  Results:   A total of 19,406 cancers were diagnosed at the University of Tennessee Cancer Institute during the study period from July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2014. The rate of second primary head and neck cancer among patients with a non-head and neck primary cancer was 0.2%. These 40 cancers occurred among a total of 849 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases (5%) diagnosed during the study period. The most common location for a second primary HNSCC was the gingiva (27.5%), followed by the oral tongue (17.5%). Significantly more gingival cancers were diagnosed than expected (P < .001) and significantly fewer tongue cancers than expected (P = .01). The most common primary cancer was prostate (27.5%), followed by breast (25%). The median survival was 28.5 months after the second primary diagnosis. A nonsignificant effect was found for age (P = .30), tobacco use (P = .12), gender (P = .60), TNM stage (P = .29), and treatment protocol (P = .96) on survival.  Conclusions:   The development of a second primary HNSCC in a population of patients with non-head and neck primary cancers is associated with decreased overall survival. The most common presentation of a second primary HNSCC in our study was in the gingiva and the most common primary cancer was in the prostate.

Using this comprehensive catalogue of miRNA targets, we analyzed miRNA targeting on known drivers of PCa and examined tissue-specific and stage-specific pathway targeting by miRNAs. We found that androgen receptor is the most frequently targeted PCa oncogene and that miR-148a targets the largest number of known PCa drivers. Globally, tissue-specific and stage-specific changes in miRNA targeting are driven by homeostatic response to active oncogenic pathways. Our findings indicate that, even in advanced PCa, the miRNA pool adapts to regulate continuing alterations in the cancer genome to balance oncogenic molecular changes.

Our study objectives were to investigate the timing, incidence and characteristics of thromboembolic events during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent radical cystectomy in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of 761 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer from 2002 to 2014. Median followup from diagnosis was 21.4 months (range 3 to 272). Patient characteristics included the Khorana score, and the incidence and timing of thromboembolic events (before vs after radical cystectomy). Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare survival between patients with vs without thromboembolic events.  Results:   The Khorana score indicated an intermediate thromboembolic event risk in 88% of patients. The overall incidence of thromboembolic events in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 14% with a wide variation of 5% to 32% among institutions. Patients with thromboembolic events were older (67.6 vs 64.6 years, p = 0.02) and received a longer neoadjuvant chemotherapy course (10.9 vs 9.7 weeks, p = 0.01) compared to patients without a thromboembolic event. Of the thromboembolic events 58% developed preoperatively and 72% were symptomatic. On multivariable regression analysis the development of a thromboembolic event was not significantly associated with decreased overall survival. However, pathological stage and a high Khorana score were adverse risk factors for overall survival.  Conclusions:   Thromboembolic events are common in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy before and after radical cystectomy.

It exhibited strong antiproliferative and apoptotic effects against human prostate and urinary bladder cancer cells.  Aim of the study:   The current study was purposed to investigate the interaction between Flavokawain A and Cytochrome P450, including the inhibitory effects of Flavokawain A on predominant CYP450 isotypes and further clarified the inhibitory mechanism of FKA on CYP450 enzymes. Besides, study about identifying the key CYP450 isotypes responsible for the metabolism of FKA was also performed.  Materials and methods:   In this study, probe-based assays with rat liver microsome system were used to characterize the inhibitory effects of FKA. Molecular docking study was performed to further explore the binding site of FKA on CYP450 isoforms. In addition, chemical inhibition experiments using specific inhibitors (a-naphthoflavone, quinidine, sulfamethoxazde, ketoconazole, omeprazole) were performed to clarify the individual CYP450 isoform that are responsible for the metabolism of FKA.  Results:   FKA showed significant inhibition on CYP1A2, CYP2D1, CYP2C6 and CYP3A2 activities with IC50 values of 102.23, 20.39, 69.95, 60.22μmol/L, respectively. The inhibition model was competitive, mixed-inhibition, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive for CYP1A2, CYP2D1, CYP2C6 and CYP3A2 enzymes. Molecular docking study indicated the ligand-binding conformation of FKA in the active site of CYP450 isoforms. The chemical inhibition experiments showed that the metabolic clearance rate of Flavokawain A decreased to 19.84%, 50.38%, and 67.02% of the control in the presence of ketoconazole, sulfamethoxazde and a-naphthoflavone.  Conclusion:   The study showed that Flavokawain A has varying inhibitory effect on CYP450 enzymes and CYP3A2 was the principal CYP isoform contributing to the metabolism of Flavokawain A.

Methods:   This is a retrospective analysis of 458 nonmetastatic CRPC men. Metastases were detected in routine bone scans or other imaging tests. Predictors of time to metastasis were analyzed using proportional hazards model with CRPC as time zero.  Results:   A total of 256 (56%) men were diagnosed with metastatic disease over a median follow-up of 36 months. Metastasis-free survival was 79%, 65%, 52%, 47%, and 41% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after CRPC, respectively. In multivariable analysis, Gleason score 8-10 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.61; P = .026), receiving primary localized treatment (HR = 1.38; P = .028), higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at CRPC diagnosis (logPSA HR = 1.64; P < .001), and PSA doubling time ≤6 months (HR = 1.42; P = .040) were independently associated with shorter time to metastasis. Race, year of CRPC, age, and time from androgen deprivation therapy to CRPC were not associated with metastasis.  Conclusion:   Among nonmetastatic CRPC men, nearly 60% developed metastatic disease during the first 5 years, with most of the metastasis occurring within the first 3 years. Higher Gleason score, receiving primary treatment, higher PSA, and shorter PSA doubling time were independently associated with shorter time to metastasis.

Materials and methods:   We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients diagnosed with pretreatment high-risk PCa from 2004 to 2011. The primary outcomes were different forms of primary therapy or watchful waiting (WW) across different types of hospitals (community, comprehensive cancer community, and academic hospitals). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test for differences in treatment by hospital type.  Results:   During the study period, we identified 102,701 men diagnosed with high-risk PCa. Overall, the most common treatment was radical prostatectomy (37.0%) followed by radiation therapy (33.2%) and WW (8.5%). Compared with white men with high-risk PCa, black men had lower adjusted odds ratios (OR) for surgery at comprehensive community (OR: 0.64; P <.001) and academic (OR: 0.62; P <.001) hospitals. Similarly, black men were also more likely to be managed with WW at community (OR: 1.49; P <.001), comprehensive cancer community (OR: 1.24; P <.001), and academic (OR: 1.55; P <.001) hospitals, as well as with radiation therapy at comprehensive cancer community (OR: 1.27; P <.001) and academic hospitals (OR: 1.23; P <.001).  Conclusion:   Disparities in the use of WW and different primary treatments among patients with high-risk PCa persisted across different types of hospitals and over time.

Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression.  Results:   We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series.

Recent studies have implied a role of INPP4B in tumor chemoresistance, while the effects of INPP4B on docetaxel resistance in PCa have not been elucidated. In the present study, the docetaxel-resistant human PCa cell lines PC3-DR and DU-145-DR were established from the parental cell lines PC3 and DU-145, and the expression and role of INPP4B in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells were investigated. The results demonstrated that INPP4B expression was significantly downregulated in docetaxel-resistant cells. Overexpression of INPP4B increased the sensitivity to docetaxel and promoted cell apoptosis in PC3-DR and DU-145-DR cells. In addition, INPP4B overexpression downregulated the expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, and upregulated the expression level of the epithelial maker E-cadherin. Furthermore, INPP4B overexpression markedly inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway. We also found that IGF-1, the inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, markedly blocked the change in EMT markers induced by overexpression of INPP4B, and reversed the resistance of PC3-DR and DU-145-DR cells to docetaxel, which is sensitized by Flag-INPP4B. In summary, the presented data indicate that INPP4B is crucial for docetaxel-resistant PCa cell survival, potentially by regulating EMT through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.""","""['Haiwen Chen', 'Hongliang Li', 'Qi Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'miR-27b and miR-34a enhance docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB1.', 'Metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'A new role for the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'INPP4B: the new kid on the PI3K block.', 'Tumor Suppressor Role of INPP4B in Chemoresistant Retinoblastoma.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'A Comprehensive RNA Study to Identify circRNA and miRNA Biomarkers for Docetaxel Resistance in Breast Cancer.', 'Non-Coding RNAs Set a New Phenotypic Frontier in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Resistance.', 'Resistance Mechanisms to Taxanes and PARP Inhibitors in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

The source-source and source-cable attenuations are not taken into account by current planning systems. The purpose of this work is to characterize these effects and their overall impact on clinically relevant metrics.  Methods and materials:   A (192)Ir ((169)Yb) Flexitron source is modeled within a Monte Carlo code, and its water dose distribution is evaluated. A second source (cable) is placed parallel at various distances to quantify the dose perturbations. The dual-source setup is then transposed to clinical prostate plans (n = 11). Each plan D90 is compared to the single-source D90. The worst-case scenario (two sources traveling in closely located positions) establishes the upper bounds of the deviations. Two setups are considered with sources constrained in catheter pairs or freely distributed. A metric proportional to the dwell times and R(-2) (where R is the intersource separation) helps determine the source position in each configuration.  Results:   The dose profiles vs. R(-2) (3-20 mm) show a maximal dose reduction effect of 65% (25%) for (169)Yb ((192)Ir) at small distances. A shadow region with at least 10% dose difference extends up to 10 cm. A similar study with a steel drive cable shows similar behavior with a maximal decrease of 10% (3%) under irradiation of a (169)Yb ((192)Ir) source. The relative D90 difference with the single source setup is 2.3% on average, up to 3.7%. It is obtained by superimposing the contributions from catheter pairs in the dual-source loading.

ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme initiating de novo lipid synthesis, has been found to be upregulated in cancer cells, and its inhibition causes suppressive effects in a variety of tumors. At present, although several ACLY inhibitors have been reported, the potential role of miRNAs in interfering ACLY still needs further clarification. Herein, four different types of tumor cells including osteosarcoma, prostate, cervical and lung cancers were adopted in our study, and we have demonstrated that miR-22 directly downregulated ACLY. Moreover, miR-22 was proved to attenuate cancer cell proliferation and invasion, as well as promote cell apoptosis via inhibiting ACLY. Additionally, we confirmed the higher ACLY protein levels and the lower miR-22 expressions in hundreds of clinical samples of the four primary tumors, and a negative correlation relationship between ACLY and miR-22 was clarified. Finally, in the four animal models, we found that along with the loss of the ACLY expression, the miR-22-treated mice developed rather smaller tumors, less probabilities of distant metastasis, and fairly longer survivals. De novo lipogenesis suppression triggered by miR-22-ACLY axis may contribute to the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. These findings provide unequivocal proofs that miR-22 is responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of ACLY, which yields promising therapeutic effects in osteosarcoma, prostate, cervical and lung cancers.""","""['Mei Xin', 'Zhiguang Qiao', 'Jing Li', 'Jianjun Liu', 'Shaoli Song', 'Xiaoping Zhao', 'Ping Miao', 'Tingting Tang', 'Lei Wang', 'Weichun Liu', 'Xiaodi Yang', 'Kerong Dai', 'Gang Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['miR-133b acts as a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates ATP citrate lyase via PPARγ in gastric cancer.', 'Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase induces triglyceride accumulation with altered fatty acid composition in cancer cells.', 'Enhanced acetylation of ATP-citrate lyase promotes the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.', 'ATP citrate lyase (ACLY): a promising target for cancer prevention and treatment.', 'ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors: An anti-cancer strategy at the crossroads of glucose and lipid metabolism.', 'Lipid metabolic reprogramming by traditional Chinese medicine and its role in effective cancer therapy.', 'Physiological and pathological roles of lipogenesis.', 'Allosteric role of the citrate synthase homology domain of ATP citrate lyase.', 'Fatty acid metabolism: A new therapeutic target for cervical cancer.', 'Novel strategy for oncogenic alteration-induced lipid metabolism reprogramming in pancreatic cancer.']"""

Patients with both post-RP PSA nadir ≤0.1 ng/ml and PSA ≤0.5 ng/ml at salvage IMRT had a 5-year BFFS of 83% as compared with 43% in other patients (P=0.001).In conclusion, with hormonal therapy in most PCa patients, the addition of salvage IMRT for post-RP biochemical failure can achieve a good outcome with low toxicity.

Methods:   Thirty-two patients were referred for [11C] Choline PET/CT before the start of docetaxel chemotherapy, after one and ten chemotherapy cycles (or - in case of discontinuation - after the last administered cycle) for therapy response assessment. [11C] Choline uptake (SUVmax, SUVmean), CT derived Houndsfield units (HUmax, HUmean), and volume of bone, lung, and nodal metastases and local recurrence were measured semi-automatically at these timepoints. Change in SUVmax, SUVmean, HUmax, HUmean, and volume was assessed between PET 2 and 1 (early response assessment, ERA) and PET 3 and 1 (late response assessment, LRA) on a patient and lesion basis. Results of PET/CT were compared to clinically used RECIST 1.1 and clinical criteria based therapy response assessment including PSA for defining progressive disease (PD) and non-progressive disease (nPD), respectively. Relationships between changes of SUVmax and SUVmean (early and late) and changes of PSAearly and PSAlate were evaluated. Prognostic value of initial SUVmax and SUVmean was assessed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS.  Results:   In the patient-based ERA and LRA there were no statistically significant differences in change of choline uptake, HU, and volume between PD and nPD applying RECIST or clinical response criteria. In the lesion-based ERA, decrease in choline uptake of bone metastases was even higher in PD (applying RECIST criteria), whereas in LRA the decrease was higher in nPD (applying clinical criteria). There were only significant correlations between change in choline uptake and PSA in ERA in PD, in LRA no significant correlations were discovered. Initial SUVmax and SUVmean were statistically significantly higher in nPD (applying clinical criteria).  Conclusion:   There is no significant correlation between change in choline uptake in [11C] Choline PET/CT and clinically routinely used objective response assessment during the early and late course of docetaxel chemotherapy.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients undergoing urological reconstructions during pelvic oncological surgeries from January 2004 to December 2013. All patients had imaging-proven involvement of at least one urological organ preoperatively. Primary outcome was urological complication rate. Secondary outcomes were nonurological complication, recurrence rate, and overall survival.  Results:   Median age of presentation was 51 years. Six and 14 patients underwent resections for primary and secondary tumors, respectively. Colorectal tumors were the most common, followed by gynecological cancers. The ureter was the most common urological organ involved, followed by the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles. Reconstructive procedures included ileal and sigmoid conduits, ureteroneocystostomies, Boari flap, transureteroureterostomies (TUUs) and direct ureteroureterostomies. Six patients developed major urological complications, requiring endoscopic and surgical reinterventions. The follow-up time was 34 months. Thirteen patients developed recurrence, associated with higher tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion, and occurred at a median time of 10 months. These patients had an overall survival of 20 months, compared to 45 months in patients without recurrence.  Conclusion:   Careful patient selection in pelvic oncological surgeries can significantly prolong survival. Recurrent tumors and greater intraoperative blood loss are associated with higher urological complications. A limited pelvic exenteration and lower radiation doses can reduce complication rates. If higher doses are necessary, conformal techniques and hyperfractionated radiotherapy should be explored. Urological reconstruction should be individualized, according to the extensiveness of urological involvement and exposure of radiation.""","""['Yu Guang Tan', 'Grace Tan', 'David Tan', 'Claramae S Chia', 'Dun Yong Ang', 'Melissa C C Teo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian J Surg""","""['Complications and 5-year survival after radical resections which include urological organs for locally advanced and recurrent pelvic malignancies: analysis of 646 consecutive cases.', 'Urological outcomes following pelvic exenteration for advanced pelvic cancer are not inferior to those following radical cystectomy.', 'Reconstruction of urinary tract combined with surgical management of locally advanced non-urological cancer involving the genitourinary organs.', 'Pelvic exenteration: current state and perspectives.', 'Oncovascular surgery for advanced pelvic malignancy.', 'A systematic approach for successful repair of radiated and non-radiated ureteral injuries.', 'The outcomes of isolated ureteral resection and reconstruction in non-urologic cancer patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRC) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).']"""

However, the ability of WB-MRI and positron emission tomography/CT to assess therapeutic benefits has not been comprehensively evaluated. There is also considerable variability in the availability and quality of WB-MRI, which is an impediment to clinical development. Expert recommendations for standardising WB-MRI scans are needed, in order to assess its performance in advanced prostate cancer (APC) clinical trials.  Objective:   To design recommendations that promote standardisation and diminish variations in the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of WB-MRI scans for use in APC.  Evidence acquisition:   An international expert panel of oncologic imagers and oncologists with clinical and research interests in APC management assessed biomarker requirements for clinical care and clinical trials. Key requirements for a workable WB-MRI protocol, achievable quality standards, and interpretation criteria were identified and synthesised in a white paper.  Evidence synthesis:   The METastasis Reporting and Data System for Prostate Cancer guidelines were formulated for use in all oncologic manifestations of APC.  Conclusions:   Uniformity in imaging data acquisition, quality, and interpretation of WB-MRI are essential for assessing the test performance of WB-MRI. The METastasis Reporting and Data System for Prostate Cancer standard requires validation in clinical trials of treatment approaches in APC.

This study demonstrates the biosynthesis, antibacterial activity, and anticancer effects of silver nanoparticles using Dimocarpus Longan Lour. peel aqueous extract. The AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR). The bactericidal properties of the synthesized AgNPs were observed via the agar dilution method and the growth inhibition test. The cytotoxicity effect was explored on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in vitro by trypan blue assay. The expressions of phosphorylated stat 3, bcl-2, survivin, and caspase-3 were examined by Western blot analysis. The longan peel extract acted as a strong reducing and stabilizing agent during the synthesis. Water-soluble AgNPs of size 9-32 nm was gathered with a face-centered cubic structure. The AgNPs had potent bactericidal activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with a dose-related effect. AgNPs also showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells through a decrease of stat 3, bcl-2, and survivin, as well as an increase in caspase-3. These findings confirm the bactericidal properties and explored a potential anticancer application of AgNPs for prostate cancer therapy. Further research should be focused on the comprehensive study of molecular mechanism and in vivo effects on the prostate cancer.""","""['Yan He', 'Zhiyun Du', 'Shijing Ma', 'Shupeng Cheng', 'Sen Jiang', 'Yue Liu', 'Dongli Li', 'Huarong Huang', 'Kun Zhang', 'Xi Zheng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nanoscale Res Lett""","""['An eco-benign synthesis of AgNPs using aqueous extract of Longan fruit peel: Antiproliferative response against human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, antioxidant and photocatalytic deprivation of methylene blue.', 'Antimicrobial and Cytotoxicity Effects of Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles from Punica granatum Peel Extract.', 'Exploiting fruit byproducts for eco-friendly nanosynthesis: Citrus\xa0×\xa0clementina peel extract mediated fabrication of silver nanoparticles with high efficacy against microbial pathogens and rat glial tumor C6 cells.', 'Therapeutic Applications of Biostable Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized Using Peel Extract of Benincasa hispida: Antibacterial and Anticancer Activities.', 'Characterization, Antibacterial and Antioxidant Properties of Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized from Aqueous Extracts of Allium sativum, Zingiber officinale, and Capsicum frutescens.', 'Activities against Lung Cancer of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles: A Review.', 'Comparative Cytotoxic Evaluation of Zygophyllum album Root and Aerial Parts of Different Extracts and Their Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles on Lung A549 and Prostate PC-3 Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Novel archetype in cancer therapeutics: exploring prospective of phytonanocarriers.', 'Glucose-Functionalized Silver Nanoparticles as a Potential New Therapy Agent Targeting Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer cells.', 'Population-Level Patterns of Prostate Cancer Occurrence: Disparities in Virginia.']"""

Material and methods:   Sixty previously treated patients (15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), 15 multiple brain metastasis (MBM), 15 cervical cancer and 15 prostate cancer) were re-planned for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), sliding window IMRT (dMLC) and step-and-shoot IMRT (ssIMRT) with and without leaf interdigitation. Various dosimetric variables, such as PTV coverage, OARs sparing, delivery efficiency and planning time, were evaluated for each plan. In addition, a protocol developed by our group was applied to identify the situations in which leaf interdigitation can achieve benefits in clinical practice.  Results:   Leaf interdigitation produced few benefits in PTV homogeneity for the MBM VMAT plans and NPC ssIMRT plans. For OARs, sparing was equivalent with and without leaf interdigitation. Leaf interdigitation showed an increase in MUs for dMLC plans and a decrease in MUs for ssIMRT plans. Leaf interdigitation resulted in an increase in segments for dMLC plans and a decrease in segments for NPC and MBM ssIMRT plans. For beam on time, leaf interdigitation showed an increase in MBM dMLC, NPC ssIMRT and prostate ssIMRT plans. In addition, leaf interdigitation saved planning time for VMAT and dMLC plans but increased planning time for ssIMRT plans.  Conclusion:   Leaf interdigitation does not improve plan quality when performing inverse treatment strategies, regardless of whether the target is simple or complex. However, it influences the delivery efficiency and planning time. Based on these observations, our study suggests that leaf interdigitation should be utilized when performing MBM VMAT plans and NPC ssIMRT plans.""","""['Jinghao Duan', 'Xiangjuan Meng', 'Tonghai Liu', 'Yong Yin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Single arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy is sufficient for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a dosimetric comparison with dual arc VMAT and dynamic MLC and step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Impact of MLC properties and IMRT technique in meningioma and head-and-neck treatments.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a dosimetric comparison with TomoTherapy and step-and-shoot IMRT.', 'Dosimetric comparison between Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) vs dual arc Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC): Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Emerging radiotherapy technologies and trends in nasopharyngeal cancer.']"""

Here, we show that the lysine residues required for ubiquitination are located mainly in the C-terminal portion of δ-catenin. In addition, we provide evidence that β-TrCP-1 interacts with δ-catenin and functions as an E3 ligase, mediating δ-catenin ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Furthermore, we prove that both the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the lysosome degradation pathway are involved in δ-catenin degradation.

We herein evaluated the impact of ADT on the FRAX score in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   The assessment of the FRAX score was performed in a total of 1220 prostate cancer patients, including patients who underwent brachytherapy (n = 547), radical prostatectomy (n = 200), external beam radiation therapy (n = 264) and hormonal therapy alone (n = 187) at Yokohama City University Hospital (Yokohama, Japan). We evaluated the effect of ADT on the FRAX score.  Results:   Using the FRAX model, the median and mean 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture according to the clinical risk factors alone was 7.9 % (8.8 ± 4.3 %), while the 10-year probability of hip fracture risk was 2.7 % (3.5 ± 3.1 %). In the ADT group, the duration of ADT was correlated with both major osteoporotic risk and hip fracture risk (R(2) = 0.141, p < 0.001 and R(2) = 0.166, p < 0.001, respectively). A comparison between the ADT (n = 187) and non-ADT (n = 399) groups demonstrated that the major fracture risk was > 20 % higher and the hip fracture risk was > 3 % higher in the ADT group than in the non-ADT group (ADT: 10 (5.3 %) and 118 (63.1 %), non-ADT 13 (3.3 %) and 189 (47.4 %), p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   These results suggested that the longer duration of ADT led to an increased FRAX score, and the FRAX score may be a predictor of bone management treatment, particularly in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Takashi Kawahara', 'Shusei Fusayasu', 'Koji Izumi', 'Yumiko Yokomizo', 'Hiroki Ito', 'Yusuke Ito', 'Kayo Kurita', 'Kazuhiro Furuya', 'Hisashi Hasumi', 'Narihiko Hayashi', 'Yasuhide Myoshi', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto', 'Masahiro Yao', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Improving bone health in prostate cancer patients starting androgen deprivation therapy: does Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) enhance stratification and targeted management?', 'Patients with prostate cancer and androgen deprivation therapy have increased risk of fractures-a study from the fractures and fall injuries in the elderly cohort (FRAILCO).', 'Comparison of fracture risk assessment tool score to bone mineral density for estimating fracture risk in patients with advanced prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.', 'French recommendations for osteoporosis prevention and treatment in patients with prostate cancer treated by androgen deprivation.', 'Bone and metabolic health in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prediction of vertebral fractures in cancer patients undergoing hormone deprivation therapies: Reliability of who fracture risk assessment tool (frax) and bone mineral density in real-life clinical practice.', 'A prospective longitudinal study to evaluate bone health, implication of FRAX tool and impact on quality of life (FACT-P) in advanced prostate cancer patients.', 'Efficacy and safety of darolutamide in Japanese patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a sub-group analysis of the phase III ARAMIS trial.', 'Associated Factors for Osteoporosis and Fracture in Chinese Elderly.', 'Implications of the Fracture Risk Assessment Algorithm for the assessment and improvement of bone health in patients with prostate cancer: A comprehensive review.']"""

Isoflavones are a class of soy-derived phytoestrogens with beneficial effects, among which genistein (GEN) has been previously indicated to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The present study evaluated the effects of soy milk digestion extract (SMD) on the progression of prostate cancer via the estrogen receptor (ER)β in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To evaluate the effects of SMD (daizein, 1.988 mg/100g, glycitein, 23.537 mg/100 g and GEN, 0.685 mg/100g) on cell proliferation, LNCaP cells were cultured in media containing vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide), 17β‑estradiol (E2; 2.7x10‑7 mg/ml), GEN (2.7x10-2 mg/ml) of SMD (total aglycon concentration, 0.79 mg/ml), after which the cell viability was examined using an MTT assay. The cell viability was significantly elevated by E2 (by 45±0.18%), while it was markedly reduced by GEN (73.2±0.03%) or SMD (74.8±0.09%). Semi‑quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to assess the mRNA expression levels of target genes, including ERβ, prostate cancer‑specific antigen (PSA) and cell cycle regulators p21, Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4. The expression of ERβ was almost completely diminished by E2, whereas it was significantly elevated by SMD. In addition, the expression levels of PSA were considerably reduced by SMD. The expression of p21 was significantly elevated by SMD, while it was markedly reduced by E2. Of note, the expression levels of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 were considerably elevated by E2, while being significantly reduced by GEN and SMD. All of these results indicated that SMD may inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells via regulating the expression of ERβ, PSA, p21, Cyclin D1 and CDK4 in an ER-dependent manner.""","""['Nam-Hee Kang', 'Hee-Chang Shin', 'Seunghyun Oh', 'Kyun-Hee Lee', 'Yoon-Bok Lee', 'Kyung-Chul Choi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Molecular effects of soy phytoalexin glyceollins in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP.', 'Genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, prevents the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells induced by 17β-estradiol or bisphenol A via the inhibition of cell cycle progression.', 'Soy isoflavones exert differential effects on androgen responsive genes in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Phytoestrogens from Belamcanda chinensis regulate the expression of steroid receptors and related cofactors in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'The estrogen receptor signaling pathway activated by phthalates is linked with transforming growth factor-β in the progression of LNCaP prostate cancer models.', 'Inhibition of castration-resistant prostate cancer growth by genistein through suppression of AKR1C3.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis and soy isoflavones: a dogfight over a bone.', 'Genistein Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Amnesia in Mice Through the Regulation of the Cholinergic Neurotransmission, Antioxidant System and the ERK/CREB/BDNF Signaling.', 'The effect of the type of dietary protein on the development of ovarian cancer.', 'Soy Consumption and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Our previous in vitro studies identified two active components in HEGU: isoangustone A, which induces apoptosis and G1 cycle arrest, and licoricidin, which inhibits metastasis. This study examined whether HEGU and licoricidin inhibit metastasis using the 4T1 mammary cancer model. Both HEGU and licoricidin treatment reduced pulmonary metastasis and the expression of CD45, CD31, HIF-1α, iNOS, COX-2, and VEGF-A in tumor tissues. Additionally, a decrease in protein expression of VEGF-R2, VEGF-C, VEGF-R3, and LYVE-1 was noted in tumor tissues of licoricidin-treated mice. Furthermore, the blood concentrations of MMP-9, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and VEGF-A were decreased in HEGU-treated mice. In vitro 4T1 cell culture results showed that both HEGU and licoricidin inhibited cell migration, MMP-9 secretion, and VCAM expression.

Objective:   We evaluated the ability of CCP score (a prognostic RNA expression signature) to discriminate between systemic disease and local recurrence in patients with BCR after RP.  Methods:   Sixty patients with BCR after RP were selected for analysis based on: 1) metastatic disease, 2) non-response to salvage external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and 3) durable response to salvage EBRT. CCP scores were generated from the RNA expression of 46 genes. Logistic regression assessed the association between CCP score and patient group.  Results:   Passing CCP scores were generated for 47 patients with complete clinical and pathologic data. CCP score predicted clinical status when comparing patients with metastatic disease or non-responders to salvage therapy to patients with durable response (p = 0.006). CCP score remained significantly predictive of clinical status after accounting for time to BCR, PSA level at BCR, and Gleason score (p = 0.0031).

Patients are then treated with more toxic standard therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel and more effective treatments for prostate cancer. The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is an attractive therapeutic target for treating endocrine-dependent cancers because cholesterol is an essential structural and functional component of cell membranes as well as the metabolic precursor of endogenous steroid hormones. In this study, we have examined the effects of RO 48-8071 (4'-[6-(allylmethylamino)hexyloxy]-4-bromo-2'-fluorobenzophenone fumarate; Roche Pharmaceuticals internal reference: RO0488071) (RO), which is an inhibitor of 2, 3-oxidosqualene cyclase (a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway), on prostate cancer cells. Exposure of both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells to RO reduced prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro. RO treatment reduced androgen receptor protein expression in hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells and increased estrogen receptor β (ERβ) protein expression in both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Combining RO with an ERβ agonist increased its ability to reduce castration-resistant prostate cancer cell viability. In addition, RO effectively suppressed the growth of aggressive castration-resistant human prostate cancer cell xenografts in vivo without any signs of toxicity to experimental animals. Importantly, RO did not reduce the viability of normal prostate cells in vitro. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor RO effectively suppresses growth of human prostate cancer cells.

By definition, these variants have very low minor allele frequencies and traditional single-marker methods for statistical analysis are underpowered for typical sequencing study sample sizes. Multimarker burden-type approaches attempt to identify aggregation of RVs across case-control status by analyzing relatively small partitions of the genome, such as genes. However, it is generally the case that the aggregative measure would be a mixture of causal and neutral variants, and these omnibus tests do not directly provide any indication of which RVs may be driving a given association. Recently, Bayesian variable selection approaches have been proposed to identify RV associations from a large set of RVs under consideration. Although these approaches have been shown to be powerful at detecting associations at the RV level, there are often computational limitations on the total quantity of RVs under consideration and compromises are necessary for large-scale application. Here, we propose a computationally efficient alternative formulation of this method using a probit regression approach specifically capable of simultaneously analyzing hundreds to thousands of RVs. We evaluate our approach to detect causal variation on simulated data and examine sensitivity and specificity in instances of high RV dimensionality as well as apply it to pathway-level RV analysis results from a prostate cancer (PC) risk case-control sequencing study. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and future directions of this work.""","""['Nicholas B Larson', 'Shannon McDonnell', 'Lisa Cannon Albright', 'Craig Teerlink', 'Janet Stanford', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'William B Isaacs', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Ethan Lange', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'John D Carpten', 'Isaac Powell', 'Joan Bailey-Wilson', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Graham Giles', 'Robert MacInnis', 'Christiane Maier', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'Chih-Lin Hsieh', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'William J Catalona', 'William Foulkes', 'Diptasri Mandal', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Michael J Ackerman', 'Timothy M Olson', 'Christopher J Klein', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Daniel J Schaid']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Genet Epidemiol""","""['Corrigendum.', 'Hierarchical Bayesian model for rare variant association analysis integrating genotype uncertainty in human sequence data.', 'A unified method for detecting secondary trait associations with rare variants: application to sequence data.', 'Bayesian latent variable collapsing model for detecting rare variant interaction effect in twin study.', 'Gene-based and pathway-based testing for rare-variant association in affected sib pairs.', 'A Bayes factor approach with informative prior for rare genetic variant analysis from next generation sequencing data.', 'Identifying individual risk rare variants using protein structure guided local tests (POINT).', 'Illustrating, Quantifying, and Correcting for Bias in Post-hoc Analysis of Gene-Based Rare Variant Tests of Association.', 'gsSKAT: Rapid gene set analysis and multiple testing correction for rare-variant association studies using weighted linear kernels.']"""

In this study, we focused on changes in expression of CD24, a well-validated clinical biomarker of poor prognosis and a driver of tumor growth and metastasis, as a benchmark to assess functional relevance. Through this approach, we identified GON4L as a regulator of CD24 from screening a pooled shRNA library of 176 candidate gain-of-function genes. GON4L depletion reduced CD24 expression in human bladder cancer cells and blocked cell proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo Mechanistically, GON4L interacted with transcription factor YY1, promoting its association with the androgen receptor to drive CD24 expression and cell growth. In clinical bladder cancer specimens, expression of GON4L, YY1, and CD24 was elevated compared with normal bladder urothelium. This pathway is biologically relevant in other cancer types as well, where CD24 and the androgen receptor are clinically prognostic, given that silencing of GON4L and YY1 suppressed CD24 expression and growth of human lung, prostate, and breast cancer cells. Overall, our results define GON4L as a novel driver of cancer growth, offering new biomarker and therapeutic opportunities.

Whether preservation of DF during TME is effective for protection of urogenital function is largely elusive.Seventy-four cases of male mid-low rectal cancer were included. Radical laparoscopic proctectomy was performed, containing 38 cases of preservation of DF (P-group) and 36 cases of resection of DF (R-group) intraoperatively.

Moreover, mRNA expression alone lacks functional interpretation, limiting opportunities for translation of single-cell transcriptomic insights to precision medicine. Lastly, most single-cell RNA-sequencing analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small populations of cells such as circulating tumor cells shed from solid tumors and isolated from patient blood samples.  Results:   In response to these characteristics and limitations in current single-cell RNA-sequencing methodology, we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways. Cell-cell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mRNA fold changes between two cells. Within an elaborate case study of circulating tumor cells derived from prostate cancer patients, we develop analytic methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially expressed pathways associated to therapeutic resistance. Our aggregation analyses perform comparably with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and better than differentially expressed genes followed by gene set enrichment. However, these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single cell. As such, our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method, cell-centric statistics (CCS). CCS quantifies the effect size and significance of differentially expressed pathways for a single cell of interest. Improved rose plots of differentially expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of CCS for therapeutic decision-making.

Self-renewing tumor-initiating cells (TICs) hold intrinsic therapy resistance and account for tumor relapse and progression. As BMI-1 regulates stem cell self-renewal, impairing BMI-1 function for TIC-tailored therapies appears to be a promising approach.  Experimental design:   We have previously developed a combined immunophenotypic and time-of-adherence assay to identify CD49bhiCD29hiCD44hi cells as human prostate TICs. We utilized this assay with patient-derived prostate cancer cells and xenograft models to characterize the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of BMI-1.  Results:   We demonstrate that in cell lines and patient-derived TICs, BMI-1 expression is upregulated and associated with stem cell-like traits. From a screened library, we identified a number of post-transcriptional small molecules that target BMI-1 in prostate TICs. Pharmacologic inhibition of BMI-1 in patient-derived cells significantly decreased colony formation in vitro and attenuated tumor initiation in vivo, thereby functionally diminishing the frequency of TICs, particularly in cells resistant to proliferation- and androgen receptor-directed therapies, without toxic effects on normal tissues.  Conclusions:   Our data offer a paradigm for targeting TICs and support the development of BMI-1-targeting therapy for a more effective prostate cancer treatment.

UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate, an essential precursor for androgen inactivation by the prostate glucuronidation enzymes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17. UGDH expression is androgen stimulated, which increases the production of UDP-glucuronate and fuels UGT-catalyzed glucuronidation. In this study, we compared the glucuronidation potential and its impact on androgen-mediated gene expression in an isogenic LNCaP model for androgen-dependent versus castration-resistant prostate cancer. Despite significantly lower androgen-glucuronide output, LNCaP 81 castration-resistant tumor cells expressed higher levels of UGDH, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17. However, the magnitude of androgen-activated UGDH and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, as well as the androgen receptor (AR)-dependent repression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, was blunted several-fold in these cells. Consistent with these results, the ligand-activated binding of AR to the PSA promoter and subsequent transcriptional activation were also significantly reduced in castration-resistant cells. Analysis of the UDP-sugar pools and flux through pathways downstream of UDP-glucuronate production revealed that these glucuronidation precursor metabolites were channeled through proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic pathways, leading to increased surface expression of Notch1. Knockdown of UGDH diminished Notch1 and increased glucuronide output. Overall, these results support a model in which the aberrant partitioning of UDP-glucuronate and other UDP-sugars into alternative pathways during androgen deprivation contributes to the loss of prostate tumor cell androgen sensitivity by promoting altered cell surface proteoglycan expression.""","""['Brenna M Zimmer', 'Michelle E Howell', 'Qin Wei', 'Linlin Ma', 'Trevor Romsdahl', 'Eileen G Loughman', 'Jennifer E Markham', 'Javier Seravalli', 'Joseph J Barycki', 'Melanie A Simpson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Androgen-stimulated UDP-glucose dehydrogenase expression limits prostate androgen availability without impacting hyaluronan levels.', 'Calcitrol (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) inhibits androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Loss of dihydrotestosterone-inactivation activity promotes prostate cancer castration resistance detectable by functional imaging.', 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Characterization and regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in steroid target tissues.', 'The Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) superfamily: the role in tumor cell metabolism.', 'The Glycosyltransferase Pathway: An Integrated Analysis of the Cell Metabolome.', 'Mechanisms of coordinating hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan production by nucleotide sugars.', 'Altered glucuronidation deregulates androgen dependent response profiles and signifies castration resistance in prostate cancer.', 'A bioinformatic analysis of the inhibin-betaglycan-endoglin/CD105 network reveals prognostic value in multiple solid tumors.']"""

On the basis of these observations, CSNK2 has emerged as a candidate for targeted therapy, with two CSNK2 inhibitors in ongoing clinical trials. CX-4945 is a bioavailable small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor targeting its active site, and CIGB-300 is a cell-permeable cyclic peptide that prevents phosphorylation of the E7 protein of HPV16 by CSNK2. In preclinical models, either of these inhibitors exhibit antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, in combinations with chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin or gemcitabine, either CX-4945 or CIGB-300 promote synergistic induction of apoptosis. While CSNK2 is a regulatory participant in many processes related to cancer, its potential to modulate caspase action may be particularly pertinent to its emergence as a therapeutic target. Because the substrate recognition motifs for CSNK2 and caspases are remarkably similar, CSNK2 can block the cleavage of many caspase substrates through the phosphorylation of sites adjacent to cleavage sites. Phosphoproteomic strategies have also revealed previously underappreciated roles for CSNK2 in the phosphorylation of several key constituents of DNA damage and DNA repair pathways. Going forward, applications of proteomic strategies to interrogate responses to CSNK2 inhibitors are expected to reveal signatures for CSNK2 inhibition and molecular insights to guide new strategies to interfere with its potential to inhibit caspase action or enhance the susceptibility of cancer cells to DNA damage.

We aimed to determine which tumor volume definition would optimally correlate with established prognostic factors and classify macroscopic tumor configuration. Radical prostatectomy specimens with follow-up to biochemical recurrence in the period between 2009 and 2012 were retrieved. Newly proposed categories of reconstructed three-dimensional macroscopic tumor configuration were nodular, medial prominence, subcapsular spreading, and miliary types. Several algorithms were applied to identify optimal tumor volume including (1) combined volume of all nodules, (2) volume of largest nodule as index tumor, and (3) volume of nodule with strongest evidence of poor prognosis. Macroscopic typing correlated well with radiologic findings, and nodular type was most common (70.7 %). In most multifocal tumors, the largest nodule showed the highest Gleason score (90.8 %) as well as extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle invasion (93.5 %). Total tumor and index tumor volumes were significant predictors of biochemical recurrence (both, P < 0.0001). Tumor volume, classified in three groups with cutoff values at 2 and 5 cm(3), was independently predictive of recurrence-free survival in multivariate analysis (P < 0.05) and surpassed bilaterality even in stage pT2. In pT2 disease, recurrence-free survival was significantly associated with total tumor volume (P = 0.003) and index tumor volume (P = 0.002), but not with pT2 substage (P = 0.278).

Therefore, analyzing AR signaling is essential to understand cancerogensis and proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa). Inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1) and ING2 are tumor suppressors with reduced expression in many cancer types. There are also indications of misregulation of ING1 and ING2 in PCa. However, the roles of ING1 and ING2 in PCa and AR signaling are poorly understood. Here, we show that surprisingly the ING1b knockdown (KD) represses AR-mediated transactivation on AR key target genes in the human LNCaP PCa cells. This is associated with growth reduction of LNCaP cells by ING1 KD. In line with this, using Ing1 knockout (KO) mice, we provide further evidence that ING1 deficiency downregulates prostate-specific AR target genes in vivo. Further analyses suggest that KD of ING1b results in induction of both cellular senescence and the cell cycle inhibitor p16 INK4a . The unexpected finding that the ING1 KD results in growth inhibition was further analyzed and can be explained by a compensatory mechanism through enhanced levels of ING2 protein in ING1-deficient condition. Accordingly, the data suggest that ING2 interacts with AR and hampers the AR transcriptional activation, causes growth arrest, and induces cellular senescence. The data further suggest that ING2 upregulates p16 INK4a , which is a novel target for ING2. Taken together, our data suggest that ING2 is a novel corepressor for AR. ING2 levels are increased upon downregulation of ING1 expression indicating a compensatory mechanism and suggests a novel crosstalk between ING1 and ING2 tumor suppressors to inhibit AR signaling and induce cellular senescence in PCa cells.  Key message:   • The tumor suppressors ING1 and 2 are dysregulated in human prostate cancer. • ING1 deficiency reduces AR-mediated gene expression in vitro and in vivo. • ING2, like ING1, inhibits AR-mediated transactivation and prostate cancer cell growth. • ING1 regulates ING2. • ING1 and ING2 crosstalk with each other to inhibit AR signaling in prostate cancer.""","""['Mohsen Esmaeili', 'Thanakorn Pungsrinont', 'Andrea Schaefer', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'ING1 and ING2: multifaceted tumor suppressor genes.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Alterations in novel candidate tumor suppressor genes, ING1 and ING2 in human lung cancer.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of ING3 expression in patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Molecular mechanisms of inhibitor of growth (ING) family members in health and malignancy.', 'Androgen-Induced MIG6 Regulates Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein and AKT to Counteract Non-Genomic AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibitor of Growth Factors Regulate Cellular Senescence.']"""

After excluding cases with neo-/adjuvant hormone treatment or radiotherapy, 93 were included in the analysis. We compared biochemical recurrence-free survival rates in subgroups with or without bilateral seminal vesicle invasion using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Bilateral prostatic lobes and bilateral seminal vesicles were involved by prostate cancers in 85 (91.4%) and 35 patients (37.6%), respectively. Actuarial 3-year and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates in patients with pT3b tumors with/without bilateral seminal vesicle invasion were 13.0%/34.3%, and 4.3%/19.8%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.02, P = 0.034), lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio 2.88, 95% confidence interval 1.43-5.81, P = 0.003) and bilateral seminal vesicle invasion (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.05, P = 0.047) were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival. After excluding cases with lymph node metastasis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, surgical margin status and bilateral seminal vesicle invasion were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Conclusions:   Although most men with seminal vesicle invasion experience biochemical recurrences after radical prostatectomy, their survival outcome is not uniform. Bilateral seminal vesicle invasion seems to represent an independent prognostic factor for pT3b patients, together with the preoperative prostate-specific antigen and lymph node status.""","""['Hyun Jung Lee', 'Jun-Hee Han', 'Dong Hoon Lee', 'Jong Kil Nam', 'Tae Nam Kim', 'Moon Kee Chung', 'Sung-Woo Park']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Does bilateral seminal vesicle invasion at radical prostatectomy predict worse prognosis than unilateral invasion among patients with pT3b prostate cancers?', 'A contemporary analysis of outcomes of adenocarcinoma of the prostate with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) after radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of prognostic factors after radical prostatectomy in pT3b prostate cancer patients in Japanese population.', 'Prognostic value of seminal vesicle involvement due to prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Handling and Staging of Radical Prostatectomy Specimens.

The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in Chinese prostate cancer patients using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR). In addition, we compared the ERG protein expression with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene. The relationship between ERG expression and clinicopathologic features was also examined. Samples from patients who underwent radical prostatectomies in Changhai Hospital (Shanghai, China) were collected and stored in ethically approved tissue banks. One hundred seventy-four prostate cancer tissue samples and 10 normal tissues were marked on standard hematoxylin-eosin (HE) sections, punched out of the paraffin blocks and inserted into a recipient block using tissue arrayer instruments. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were employed to detect TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene. ERG was highly expressed in the nuclei of endothelial cells of vessels and weak cytoplasmic staining was occasionally observed. ERG positive staining was present in 14.9 % (26/174) of the tumor samples in microarray. All benign prostate samples were found to be negative. RT-PCR results revealed that 11.1 % (15/135) were TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive. Altogether, there was a good agreement of ERG immunostaining with the presence of TMPRSS2:ERG. However, no correlation was observed between ERG expression and age, Gleason score, stage, surgical margin, and seminal vesicle involvement in Chinese patients. In the present study, we identified a high correlation between ERG expression and ERG TMPRSS2:ERG, with 100 % sensitivity and 88.9 % specificity. The expression level of ERG was unrelated to the age, Gleason score, stage, surgical margin, and seminal vesicle involvement. Therefore, the association between ERG expression and prostate cancer based on Chinese population should be further investigated in the future.""","""['Hui Jiang', 'Xueying Mao', 'Xiaoyi Huang', 'Jing Zhao', 'Lumei Wang', 'Jingjing Xu', 'Hongwei Zhang', 'Yongjie Lu', 'Yongwei Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Erratum to: TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene occurs less frequently in Chinese patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'ETS family-associated gene fusions in Japanese prostate cancer: analysis of 194 radical prostatectomy samples.', 'TMPRSS2:ETS fusions and clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate cancer patients from Eastern China.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'TMPRSS2: Potential Biomarker for COVID-19 Outcomes.', 'Molecular characterization of prostate cancer in Middle Eastern population highlights differences with Western populations with prognostic implication.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'ERG Tumor Type is Less Frequent in High Grade and High Stage Prostate Cancers of Chinese Men.', 'Urinary markers aiding in the detection and risk stratification of prostate cancer.']"""

Each step may be a source of error, which if unnoticed or uncorrected may have consequences for research. We aimed to develop a simple and inexpensive genotyping method that would be valuable to detect such errors and confirm sample identity. For this purpose, seven variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci were selected, analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and organized in a PCR-based DNA profiling algorithm that proved useful to minimize the number of steps required for the procedure. Match probability calculations suggest that this method/algorithm has the potential to discriminate every participant of a biobank. As a proof of concept, the algorithm was applied on samples taken from the PROCURE Prostate Cancer Biobank. It was applied on 403 DNA samples from 101 randomly chosen patients who provided prostate tissues at surgery and blood at two to three different time points over a period of up to 7 years. A unique DNA profile requiring the analysis of no more than four VNTR loci (D16S83, D17S5, D1S80, D19S20) was successfully obtained for each of the 101 cases studied and led to the identification of two mismatches among the 403 samples evaluated (0.5% error rate). Further investigations using the same genotyping method revealed that one of the errors was due to tissue mishandling and that the other was due to tissue mislabeling. These errors, typical to the complex biobanking process, highlight the importance to implement a routine genotyping method as part of quality assurance in biobanking.""","""['Charles Pellerin', 'Ginette McKercher', 'Armen G Aprikian', 'Fred Saad', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Michel Carmel', 'Simone Chevalier']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biopreserv Biobank""","""['Utility of fast mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat genotyping in clinical mycobacteriological analysis.', 'DNA methylome profiling using neonatal dried blood spot samples: a proof-of-principle study.', 'Quality of biomaterials in liquid- and tissue-biobanking.', 'Utility and evaluation of new variable-number tandem-repeat systems for genotyping mycobacterial tuberculosis isolates.', 'DNA fingerprinting and forensic medicine.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 919 men 35 to 49 years old and 45,098 men 50 to 66 years old who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2012 were identified in PCBaSe (Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden). Cancer specific mortality was compared among age groups (35 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 63 and 64 to 66 years) with and without adjusting for cancer characteristics, comorbidity and education in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Clinical cancer characteristics indicated that most nonmetastatic cancer in men younger than 50 years was detected after prostate specific antigen testing. The proportion of nonmetastatic vs metastatic disease at diagnosis was similar in all age groups. A strong association between younger age and poor prognosis was apparent in men in whom metastatic disease was diagnosed before age 50 to 55 years. The crude and adjusted HRs of cancer specific mortality were 1.41 (95% CI 1.12-1.79) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.01-1.62) in men diagnosed before age 50 and at age 50 to 59 years, respectively. In men with nonmetastatic disease crude cancer specific mortality increased with older age but adjusted cancer specific mortality was similar in all age groups.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that an aggressive form of metastatic prostate cancer is particularly common in men younger than 50 to 55 years.

In this study, we explored the expression change of miR-301a and miR-301b in prostate cancer cells in hypoxia and studied their regulation of autophagy and radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS QRT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression change of miR-301a and miR-301b in hypoxia. Their effects on autophagy were measured by Western blot analysis, and their effects on radiosensitivity were measured by clonogenic assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the regulation of miR-301a and miR-301b on NDRG2, a tumor-suppressor gene in prostate cancer, was also studied. The effect of miR-301a/b-NDRG2 axis on autophagy and radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells was further investigated. RESULTS MiR-301a and miR-301b are 2 hypoxia responsive miRNAs that are significantly upregulated in hypoxia in prostate cancer cells. Higher level of miR-301a and miR-301b expression results in elevated autophagy and increased radioresistance in LNCaP cells. MiR-301a and miR-301b simultaneously target NDRG2 and decrease its expression. Knockdown of NDRG2 leads to increased autophagy and radioresistance. CONCLUSIONS MiR-301a and miR-301b are 2 hypoxia-responsive miRNAs that decrease autophagy of prostate cancer cells in hypoxia by targeting NDRG2.

Regulation of TBX15 is uncovered. In this study, we investigated the regulation of TBX15 expression in human cancer cells, by analyzing the regulatory function of a 5'-distal conserved region of TBX15. Bisulfite sequencing showed high methylation of the CpG island contained in this region that was not correlated with TBX15 mRNA levels, in the cancer cell lines analyzed; however, after 5-aza-dC treatment of TPC-1 cells an increase of TBX15 expression was observed. We also found a significant response of TBX15 to TNF-α activation of the NF-κB pathway using five cancer cell lines, and similar results were obtained when NF-κB was activated with PMA/ionomycin. Next, by luciferase reporter assays, we identified the TBX15 regulatory region containing two functional NF-κB binding sites with response to NF-κBp65, mapping on the -3302 and -3059 positions of the TBX15 gene. Moreover, a direct interaction of NF-κBp65 with one of the two NF-κB binding sites was indicated by ChIP assays. In summary, we provide novel data showing that NF-κB signaling up-regulates TBX15 expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, the link between TBX15 and NF-κB found in this study may be important to understand cancer and development processes.""","""['Jéssica Arribas', 'Tatiana Cajuso', 'Angela Rodio', 'Ricard Marcos', 'Antonio Leonardi', 'Antonia Velázquez']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['NF-κB, Sp1 and NF-Y as transcriptional regulators of human SND1 gene.', 'Methylation-dependent activation of CDX1 through NF-κB: a link from inflammation to intestinal metaplasia in the human stomach.', 'Transcriptional activation of the human prostatic acid phosphatase gene by NF-kappaB via a novel hexanucleotide-binding site.', 'In vivo binding of NF-kappaB to the IkappaBbeta promoter is insufficient for transcriptional activation.', 'Characterization of the infection-responsive bovine lactoferrin promoter.', 'The overexpression and clinical significance of TBX15 in human gliomas.', 'Promoter-Adjacent DNA Hypermethylation Can Downmodulate Gene Expression: TBX15 in the Muscle Lineage.', 'Noninvasive detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using the methylation signature of circulating tumour DNA.', 'TBX15/miR-152/KIF2C pathway regulates breast cancer doxorubicin resistance via promoting PKM2 ubiquitination.', 'Establishment of the TALE-code reveals aberrantly activated homeobox gene PBX1 in Hodgkin lymphoma.']"""

In this study, we report structure-guided discovery of two distinct classes of small-molecule antagonists for the CBX7ChD. Our Class A compounds, a series including analogues of the previously reported MS452, inhibit CBX7ChD/methyl-lysine binding by occupying the H3K27me3 peptide binding site, whereas our Class B compound, the newly discovered MS351, appears to inhibit H3K27me3 binding when CBX7ChD is bound to RNA. Our crystal structure of the CBX7ChD/MS351 complex reveals the molecular details of ligand recognition by the aromatic cage residues that typically engage in methyl-lysine binding. We further demonstrate that MS351 effectively induces transcriptional derepression of CBX7 target genes, including p16 (INK4a) in mouse embryonic stem cells and human prostate cancer PC3 cells.

We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate the overall survival (OS) of men with mPCa treated with androgen deprivation (ADT) with and without prostate RT.  Methods:   The NCDB was queried for men with newly diagnosed mPCa, all treated with ADT, with complete datasets for RT, surgery, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score-matched analyses.  Results:   From 2004 to 2012, 6,382 men with mPCa were identified, including 538 (8.4%) receiving prostate RT. At a median follow-up of 5.1 years, the addition of prostate RT to ADT was associated with improved OS on univariate (P < .001) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.624; 95% CI, 0.551 to 0.706; P < .001) adjusted for age, year, race, comorbidity score, PSA level, Gleason score, T stage, N stage, chemotherapy administration, treating facility, and insurance status. Propensity score analysis with matched baseline characteristics demonstrated superior median (55 v 37 months) and 5-year OS (49% v 33%) with prostate RT plus ADT compared with ADT alone (P < .001). Landmark analyses limited to long-term survivors of ≥1, ≥3, and ≥5 years demonstrated improved OS with prostate RT in all subsets (all P < .05). Secondary analyses comparing the survival outcomes for patients treated with therapeutic dose RT plus ADT versus prostatectomy plus ADT during the same time interval demonstrated no significant differences in OS, whereas both therapies were superior to ADT alone.

Disclosure-informing advisees of a potential bias-is a popular solution for managing conflicts of interest. Prior research has focused almost exclusively on disclosures of financial conflicts of interest but little is known about how disclosures of other types of biases could impact advisees. In medicine, for example, physicians often recommend the treatment they specialize in; e.g., surgeons are more likely to recommend surgery than nonsurgeons. In recognition of this bias, some physicians inform patients about their specialty bias when other similarly effective treatment options exist. Using field data (recorded transcripts of surgeon-patient consultations) from Veteran Affairs hospitals and a randomized controlled laboratory experiment, we examine and find that disclosures of specialty bias increase patients' trust and their likelihood of choosing a treatment in accordance with the physicians' specialty.

Here, we assessed the association of intratumoral mRNA expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes, transporters, and regulators in tumor specimen at diagnosis and lethal prostate cancer, defined as mortality or metastases from prostate cancer in contrast to nonlethal disease without evidence of metastases after at least 8 years of follow-up. We analyzed the prospective prostate cancer cohorts within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 249) and the Physicians' Health Study (n = 153) as well as expectantly managed patients in the Swedish Watchful Waiting Study (n = 338). The expression of squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) was associated with lethal cancer in all three cohorts. Men with high SQLE expression (>1 standard deviation above the mean) were 8.3 times (95% confidence interval, 3.5 to 19.7) more likely to have lethal cancer despite therapy compared with men with the mean level of SQLE expression. Absolute SQLE expression was associated with lethal cancer independently from Gleason grade and stage, as was a SQLE expression ratio in tumor versus surrounding benign prostate tissue. Higher SQLE expression was tightly associated with increased histologic markers of angiogenesis. Collectively, this study establishes the prognostic value of intratumoral cholesterol synthesis as measured via SQLE, its second rate-limiting enzyme. SQLE expression at cancer diagnosis is prognostic for lethal prostate cancer both after curative-intent prostatectomy and in a watchful waiting setting, possibly by facilitating micrometastatic disease.

Mast cells have been detected in chronic inflammatory infiltrate of the prostate, and it is possible that the interaction between prostate epithelial cells and Trichomonas vaginalis influences the activity of mast cells in the prostate stroma. Activated mast cells might influence the biological functions of nearby tissues and cells. In this study, we investigated whether mast cells reacted with the culture supernatant of BPH epithelial cells infected with T. vaginalis may induce the proliferation of prostate stromal cells.  Methods:   To measure the proliferation of prostate stromal cells in response to chronic inflammation caused by the infection of BPH-1 cells with T. vaginalis, the CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay were used. ELISAs, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure the production and expression of inflammatory cytokine and cytokine receptor.  Results:   BPH-1 cells incubated with live trichomonads produced increased levels of CCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL8, and induced the migration of mast cells and monocytes. When the culture supernatant of BPH-1 cells stimulated with trichomonads (TCM) was added to mast cells, they became activated, as confirmed by release of β-hexosaminidase and CXCL8. Prostate stromal cells incubated with the culture supernatant of mast cells activated with TCM (M-TCM) proliferated and expressed increased levels of CXCL8, CCL2, and the cytokine receptors CXCR1 and CCR2. Blocking the chemokine receptors reduced the proliferation of stromal cells and also decreased the production of CXCL8 and CCL2. Moreover, the expression of FGF2, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 was increased in the proliferated stromal cells stimulated with M-TCM. Additionally, the M-TCM-treated stromal cells were more invasive than control cells.  Conclusions:   The inflammatory mediators released by BPH epithelial cells in response to infection by trichomonads induce the migration and activation of mast cells. The activated mast cells induce the proliferation of prostate stromal cells via CXCL8-CXCR1 and CCL2-CCR2 signaling. Our results therefore show that the inflammatory response by BPH epithelial cells stimulated with T. vaginalis induce the proliferation of prostate stromal cells via crosstalk with mast cells.

Bone seeking treatment options are limited with adverse consequences on rapidly proliferating tissues such as bone marrow. In the present study, we seek to determine the bone-enriching capabilities of monomethyl auristatin E phosphate (MMAEp), a derivative of the potent antimitotic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).  Methods:   The in vitro actions and mechanisms of cytotoxicity were assessed using cell viability, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. In vivo efficacy was determined using an intratibial xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer and live animal imaging.  Results:   The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MMAE and MMAEp was determined to be approximately 2 and 48 nM, respectively, in PC-3 and C4-2B cell lines. MMAEp retained the mechanism of action of MMAE in reducing microtubule polymerization and stalling cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition. MMAEp was able to bind hydroxyapatite in in vitro assays. MMAEp significantly reduced intratibial tumor growth compared to the vehicle control treatment.

Methods:   AZGP1 IHC and RISH were performed on a large multi-institutional tissue microarray resource including 1,275 men with 5 year median follow-up. The relationship between IHC and RISH expression levels was assessed using the Kappa analysis. Associations with clinical and pathological parameters were tested by the Chi-square test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Relationships with outcome were assessed with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and the Log-rank test.  Results:   Absent or weak expression of AZGP1 protein was associated with worse recurrence free survival (RFS), disease specific survival, and overall survival after radical prostatectomy in univariable analysis. AZGP1 protein expression, along with pre-operative serum PSA levels, surgical margin status, seminal vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, and Gleason score predicted RFS on multivariable analysis. Similarly, absent or low AZGP1 RNA expression by RISH predicted worse RFS after prostatectomy in univariable and multivariable analysis.

However, prior studies used tissue removed for clinical indications, potentially skewing inflammation extent or biasing the association. We, therefore, evaluated inflammation and LUTS incidence and progression in men who underwent biopsy of the prostate peripheral zone irrespective of indication.  Materials and methods:   We developed nested case-control sets in men in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who were free of clinical BPH and had a protocol-directed year 7 biopsy. Cases had baseline IPSS <15 and year 7 IPSS of 8-14 (low, N = 47), 15-19 (incident moderate, N = 42), or ≥20 (incident high, N = 44). Controls had baseline and year 7 IPSS <8 (N = 41). For progression from IPSS <8, cases had baseline to year 7 IPSS slope >75th percentile (N = 46) and controls had a slope <25th percentile (N = 45). For progression from IPSS = 8-14, cases had a slope >75th percentile (N = 46) and controls had a slope <25th percentile (N = 46). We reviewed three H&E-stained biopsy cores per man to determine prevalence of ≥1 core with inflammation and mean extent (%) of tissue area with inflammation.  Results:   Inflammation prevalence in low cases (64%) was similar to controls (66%), but higher in moderate (69%) and high (73%) cases (P-trend = 0.4). Extent did not differ across LUTS categories (P-trend = 0.5). For progression from IPSS < 8, prevalence (65%, P = 0.9) and extent (2.5%, P = 0.8) in cases did not differ from controls (64%, 2.7%). For progression from IPSS 8-14, prevalence in cases (52%) was lower than in controls (78%, P = 0.009), while extent was higher in cases (5.3%) than controls (3.6%), especially in men with ≥1 core with inflammation (10.1% versus 4.6%, P = 0.06).

We compared the incidence of grade 3 UAEs, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, after low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, as well as after LDR plus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and HDR plus EBRT.  Methods and materials:   Men aged >65 years with nonmetastatic prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were treated with LDR (n=12,801), HDR (n=685), LDR plus EBRT (n=8518), or HDR plus EBRT (n=2392). The populations were balanced by propensity weighting, and the Kaplan-Meier incidence of severe UAEs was compared. Propensity-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the adjusted hazard of UAEs. These UAEs were compared with those in a cohort of men not treated for prostate cancer.  Results:   Median follow-up was 4.3 years. At 8 years, the propensity-weighted cumulative UAE incidence was highest after HDR plus EBRT (26.6% [95% confidence interval, 23.8%-29.7%]) and lowest after LDR (15.7% [95% confidence interval, 14.8%-16.6%]). The absolute excess risk over nontreated controls at 8 years was 1.9%, 3.8%, 8.4%, and 12.9% for LDR, HDR, LDR plus EBRT, and HDR plus EBRT, respectively. These represent numbers needed to harm of 53, 26, 12, and 8 persons, respectively. The additional risk of development of a UAE related to treatment for LDR, LDR plus EBRT, and HDR plus EBRT was greatest within the 2 years after treatment and then continued to decline over time. Beyond 4 years, the risk of development of a new severe UAE matched the baseline risk of the control population for all treatments.  Conclusions:   Toxicity differences were observed between LDR and HDR, but the differences did not meet statistical significance. However, combination radiation therapy (either HDR plus EBRT or LDR plus EBRT) increases the risk of severe UAEs compared with HDR alone or LDR alone. The highest increased risk of urinary toxicity occurs within the 2 years after therapy and then declines to an approximately 1% increase in incidence per year.""","""['Jonathan D Tward', 'Stephanie Jarosek', 'Haitao Chu', 'Cameron Thorpe', 'Dennis C Shrieve', 'Sean Elliott']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Propensity-weighted long-term risk of urinary adverse events after prostate cancer surgery, radiation, or both.', 'Management of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 4 urinary adverse events after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Brachytherapy: current status and future strategies -- can high dose rate replace low dose rate and external beam radiotherapy?', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of outcomes in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-/high-dose-rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy.', 'Radioactive Iodine-125 in Tumor Therapy: Advances and Future Directions.', 'Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy as a boost in synchronous prostate and rectal cancer treatment: case report and literature review.', 'A Brief Review of Low-Dose Rate (LDR) and High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Boost for High-Risk Prostate.', 'Brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer in the modern era: a comparison of patient-reported quality of life outcomes among different techniques.']"""

Methods and materials:   We analyzed the data from 699 patients. Intraoperative dosimetry was acquired using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Intraoperative dosimetry (minimal dose to 40%-95% of the volume [D40-D95]) was compared with the day 30 dosimetry for both modalities. An additional edema-compensating comparison was performed for D90. Stranded seeds were linked between TRUS and CBCT using an automatic and fast linking procedure. Displacement patterns were analyzed for each seed implantation location.  Results:   On average, an intraoperative (TRUS to CBCT) D90 decline of 10.6% ± 7.4% was observed. Intraoperative CBCT D90 showed a greater correlation (R(2) = 0.33) with respect to Day 30 than did TRUS (R(2) = 0.17). Compensating for edema, the correlation increased to 0.41 for CBCT and 0.38 for TRUS. The mean absolute intraoperative seed displacement was 3.9 ± 2.0 mm. The largest seed displacements were observed near the rectal wall. The central and posterior seeds showed less caudal displacement than lateral and anterior seeds. Seeds that were implanted closer to the base showed more divergence than seeds close to the apex.  Conclusions:   Intraoperative CBCT D90 showed a greater correlation with the day 30 dosimetry than intraoperative TRUS. Edema seemed to cause most of the systematic difference between the intraoperative and day 30 dosimetry.

The decreased SOD2 activity could lead to AR gain-of-function and the development of castration-resistance.  Methods:   We genotyped SOD2-rs4880 in a cohort of 753 prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between 1996 and 2010. The rs4880 encodes Ala16Val in SOD2 and the Val variant has been demonstrated to be functionally less efficient than the Ala variant. We assessed the impact of SOD2-rs4880 variants on the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) on ADT using multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   Four hundred thirty-two out of 753 (57%) had metastases at the time of ADT initiation. Overall, median TTP on ADT was 18.4 (95%CI: 15.8, 20.9) months and median overall survival (OS) from ADT initiation was 6.3 (95%CI: 5.8, 6.8) years. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there was no association between SOD-rs4880 and TTP or OS on ADT (P > 0.05). Results were similarly negative among patients with and without metastatic disease at ADT initiation.  Conclusions:   Our result suggests that a functional genetic variant in SOD2 does not determine the efficacy of ADT for prostate cancer. It is possible that the drastic downregulation of SOD2 in advanced prostate cancer cells may have overridden any influence of the genetic variation of SOD2.

The objective of this study was to determine current clinical utility of tNGS for prostate cancer management.  Methods:   Seven academic genitourinary medical oncologists recruited and consented patients with prostate cancer, largely with unusual clinical and/or pathologic features, from 2013 to 2015. UW-OncoPlex was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors and/or metastatic biopsies. Results were discussed at a multidisciplinary precision tumor board prior to communicating to patients. FFPE tumor DNA was extracted for tNGS analysis of 194 cancer-associated genes. Results, multidisciplinary discussion, and treatment changes were recorded.  Results:   Forty-five patients consented and 42 had reportable results. Findings included mutations in genes frequently observed in prostate cancer. We also found alterations in genes where targeted treatments were available and/or in clinical trials. 4/42 (10%) cases, change in treatment directly resulted from tNGS and multidisciplinary discussion. In 30/42 (71%) cases additional options were available but not pursued and/or were pending. Notably, 10/42 (24%) of patients harbored suspected germline mutations in moderate or high-penetrance cancer risk genes, including BRCA2, TP53, ATM, and CHEK2. One patient's tumor had bi-allelic MSH6 mutation and microsatellite instability. In total, 34/42 (81%) cases resulted in some measure of treatment actionability. Limitations include small size and limited clinical outcomes.  Conclusions:   Targeted NGS tumor sequencing may help guide immediate and future treatment options for men with prostate cancer. A substantial subset had germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes with potential clinical management implications for men and their relatives.

Interleukin 2 (IL2), widely used in adoptive therapies, was proven essential in animal models for dTc to eradicate established solid tumors.  Methods:   Patients under-went chemotherapy condi-tion-ing, followed by dTc dosing under a Phase I escalation with continuous infusion low dose IL2 (LDI). A target of dTc escalation was to achieve ≥20% engraftment of infused activated T cells.  Results:   Six patients enrolled with doses prepared of whom five were treated. Patients received 10(9) or 10(10) autologous T cells, achieving expansions of 20-560-fold over 2 weeks and engraftments of 5-56%. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses established the impact of conditioning to promote expansion and engraftment of the infused T cells. Unexpectedly, administered IL2 was depleted up to 20-fold with high engraftments of activated T cells (aTc) in an inverse correlation (P < 0.01). Clinically, no anti-PSMA toxicities were noted, and no anti-CAR reactivities were detected post-treatment. Two-of-five patients achieved clinical partial responses (PR), with PSA declines of 50% and 70% and PSA delays of 78 and 150 days, plus a minor response in a third patient. Responses were unrelated to dose size (P = 0.6), instead correlating inversely with engraftment (P = 0.06) and directly with plasma IL2 (P = 0.03), suggesting insufficient IL2 with our LDI protocol to support dTc anti-tumor activity under optimal (high) dTc engraftments.  Conclusions:   Under a Phase I dose escalation in prostate cancer, a 20% engraftment target was met or exceeded in three subjects with adequate safety, leading to study conclusion. Clinical responses were obtained but were suggested to be restrained by low plasma IL2 when depleted by high levels of engrafted activated T cells. This report presents a unique example of how the pharmaco-dynamics of ""drug-drug"" interactions may have a critical impact on the efficacy of their co-application. A new Pilot/Phase II trial is planned to test moderate dose IL2 (MDI) together with high dTc engraftments for anticipated improved therapeutic efficacy.

Nowadays, there is no treatment for this aggressive form of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN, a non-selective cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist) on the NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   NE differentiation of prostate cancer LNCaP cells was induced by serum deprivation or by incubation with interleukin-6, for 6 days. Levels of NE markers and signaling proteins were determined by western blotting. Levels of cannabinoid receptors were determined by quantitative PCR. The involvement of signaling cascades was investigated by pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA.  Results:   The differentiated LNCaP cells exhibited neurite outgrowth, and increased the expression of the typical NE markers neuron-specific enolase and βIII tubulin (βIII Tub). Treatment with 3 μM WIN inhibited NK differentiation of LNCaP cells. The cannabinoid WIN downregulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in NE differentiation inhibition. In addition, an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was observed in WIN-treated cells, which correlated with a decrease in the NE markers expression. Our results also show that during NE differentiation the expression of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 dramatically decreases.  Conclusions:   Taken together, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt/AMPK might be an important axis modulating NE differentiation of prostate cancer that is blocked by the cannabinoid WIN, pointing to a therapeutic potential of cannabinoids against NE prostate cancer.""","""['C Morell', 'A Bort', 'D Vara', 'A Ramos-Torres', 'N Rodríguez-Henche', 'I Díaz-Laviada']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Involvement of the CB2 cannabinoid receptor in cell growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Cannabinoid receptor as a novel target for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Induction of apoptosis by cannabinoids in prostate and colon cancer cells is phosphatase dependent.', 'Cannabinoids in the treatment of cancer.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.', 'Cannabinoids as Prospective Anti-Cancer Drugs: Mechanism of Action in Healthy and Cancer Cells.', 'Anti-prostate cancer metabolites from the soil-derived Aspergillus neoniveus.', 'Synthetic Cannabinoid Agonist WIN 55212-2 Targets Proliferation, Angiogenesis, and Apoptosis via MAPK/AKT Signaling in Human Endometriotic Cell Lines and a Murine Model of Endometriosis.', 'Antimicrobial and Cytotoxic Effects of Cannabinoids: An Updated Review with Future Perspectives and Current Challenges.', 'The Therapeutic Potential of the Endocannabinoid System in Age-Related Diseases.']"""

This analysis aimed to investigate the abiraterone exposure-PSA dynamics relationship in mCRPC.  Methods:   Abiraterone pharmacokinetics-PSA models were constructed using data from the COU-AA-301 (chemotherapy-pretreated) and COU-AA-302 (chemotherapy-naïve) trials comparing abiraterone acetate 1000 mg/day plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily with prednisone alone in mCRPC. The drug effect-PSA dynamics relationship was modeled as a function of selected pharmacokinetic measures. The influences of baseline demographic variables, laboratory values, and disease status on PSA dynamics were assessed.  Results:   A tumor growth inhibition model best described PSA dynamics post-treatment with abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate treatment in chemotherapy-pretreated and chemotherapy-naïve patients increased the PSA decay rate (k dec) to the same extent (1.28-fold, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.98; and 0.93-fold, 95 % CI 0.6-1.27, respectively). Lower baseline lactate dehydrogenase and higher baseline testosterone significantly increased k dec. Findings from our analysis suggest a maximum-effect relationship between abiraterone trough concentration and PSA dynamics in both patient populations. The majority of patients had a steady-state trough concentration greater than the estimated half maximal effective concentration.

The need to compare two correlated ROC curves arises when individuals are measured with two biomarkers, which induces paired and thus correlated measurements. Many researchers have focused on comparing two correlated ROC curves in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), which summarizes the overall performance of the marker. However, particular values of specificity may be of interest. We focus on comparing two correlated ROC curves at a given specificity level. We propose parametric approaches, transformations to normality, and nonparametric kernel-based approaches. Our methods can be straightforwardly extended for inference in terms of ROC-1 (t). This is of particular interest for comparing the accuracy of two correlated biomarkers at a given sensitivity level. Extensions also involve inference for the AUC and accommodating covariates. We evaluate the robustness of our techniques through simulations, compare them with other known approaches, and present a real-data application involving prostate cancer screening.

Patients and methods:   This study included 112 patients with CRPC treated with docetaxel-based systemic chemotherapy. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for Grade 4 neutropenia in the first cycle of chemotherapy.  Results:   Sixty-two of 112 patients (55.4%) developed Grade 4 neutropenia in the first cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. There were significant differences in age, baseline white blood cell count, and baseline neutrophil count between patients with non-Grade 4 neutropenia and those with Grade 4 neutropenia in univariate analyses. The serum prostate-specific antigen level, hemoglobin level, creatinine, albumin, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, metastatic sites, extent of disease, and history of external beam radiotherapy to the prostate were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; P = .019) and baseline neutrophil counts (OR, 0.79; P = .045) were significant independent risk factors for severe neutropenia. A nomogram and a calibration plot on the basis of these results were developed from a multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the probability of Grade 4 neutropenia.

However, the mechanisms involved in hormone independent behavior of PCa remain unclear. In the present study, we identified androgen-induced miR-135a as a direct target of AR. Functional studies revealed that overexpression of miR-135a could significantly decrease cell proliferation and migration, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa. We identified RBAK and MMP11 as direct targets of miR-135a in PCa by integrating bioinformatics analysis and experimental assays. Mechanistically, miR-135a repressed PCa migration through downregulating MMP11 and induced PCa cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by suppressing RBAK. Consistently, inverse correlations were also observed between the expression of miR-135a and RBAK or MMP11 in PCa samples. In addition, low miR-135a and high RBAK and MMP11 expression were positively correlated with PCa progression. Also, PI3K/AKT pathway was confirmed to be an upstream regulation signaling of miR-135a in androgen-independent cell lines. Accordingly, we reported a resistance mechanism to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) mediated by miR-135a which might be downregulated by androgen depletion and/or PI3K/AKT hyperactivation, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), thus promoting tumor progression.

C4-2 cells were cultured and divided into a si-SALL4 group, a negative control siRNA group, and a blank control group. SALL4 mRNA levels and protein expression were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. Changes in the cell proliferation and colony formation capacities were observed by using the MTS colorimetric method and colony formation assay, respectively. The influence of SALL4 on apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and bcl-like-protein 4 (Bax) were detected by western blot. The si-SALL4 group had significantly lower mRNA and protein levels of SALL4 as well as decreased proliferation and colony formation capacities than the negative control group (P < 0.05). There were significantly more apoptotic cells in the si-SALL4 group compared to the negative control (P < 0.05), and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax decreased and increased, respectively, after treatment with si-SALL4. Silencing SALL4 expression by using siRNA technology inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of C4-2 cells, and promoted apoptosis likely mediated by Bcl-2 and Bax expression.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective, multi-institutional analysis of 437 patients with intermediate-risk PC treated with SBRT (N=300) or HDR-B (N=137) was performed. Men who underwent SBRT were treated to 35 to 40 Gy in 4 to 5 fractions. A total of 95.6% who underwent HDR-B were treated to 42 Gy in 6 fractions. Baseline patient characteristics were compared using a T test for continuous variables and the Mantel-Haenszel χ metric or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to estimate 5-year actuarial BRFS. Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate factors associated with biochemical failure.  Results:   The mean age at diagnosis was 68.4 (SD±7.8) years. T-category was T1 in 63.6% and T2 in 36.4%. Mean initial prostate-specific antigen was 7.4 (SD±3.4) ng/mL. Biopsy Gleason score was ≤3+4 in 82.8% and 4+3 in 17.2%. At a median of 4.1 years of follow-up, the BRFS rate (Phoenix definition) was 96.3%, with no difference when stratifying by treatment modality or biologically equivalent dose (BED1.5). On multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio 1.08, P=0.04) and biopsy Gleason score (hazard ratio 2.48, P=0.03) were significant predictors of BRFS.  Conclusions:   With a median follow-up period of 4 years, SBRT and HDR-B monotherapy provide excellent BRFS in intermediate-risk PC.

In this commentary, we articulate 9 recommendations that we hope future clinical trialists and funding agencies (including those under the National Cancer Institute) will take into consideration when planning RCTs to help guide subsequent interpretation of results and clinical decision making, based on RCTs of external beam radiation therapy dose escalation for the most common indolent cancer in men, that is, prostate cancer. We recommend routinely reporting: (1) race; (2) medical comorbidities; (3) psychiatric comorbidities; (4) insurance status; (5) education; (6) marital status; (7) income; (8) sexual orientation; and (9) facility-related characteristics (eg, number of centers involved, type of facilities, yearly hospital volumes). We discuss how these factors independently affect patient outcomes and toxicities; future clinicians and governing organizations should consider this information to plan RCTs accordingly (to maximize patient accrual and total n), select appropriate endpoints (eg, toxicity, quality of life, sexual function), actively monitor RCTs, and report results so as to identify the optimal treatment among subpopulations.""","""['Nicholas G Zaorsky', 'Brian L Egleston', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Timothy N Showalter', 'Robert B Den']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Beyond the development of health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measures: a checklist for evaluating HRQOL outcomes in cancer clinical trials--does HRQOL evaluation in prostate cancer research inform clinical decision making?', 'Quality of patient-reported outcome reporting across cancer randomized controlled trials according to the CONSORT patient-reported outcome extension: A pooled analysis of 557 trials.', 'Insurance and quality of life in men with prostate cancer: data from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urological Research Endeavor.', 'Controversies in prostate cancer radiotherapy: consensus development.', ""Men's health supplement use and outcomes in men receiving definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer."", 'Prostate Cancer Patients With Unmanaged Diabetes or Receiving Insulin Experience Inferior Outcomes and Toxicities After Treatment With Radiation Therapy.', 'A comparison of robotic arm versus gantry linear accelerator stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of outcomes and toxicities among radiation therapy treatment options for prostate cancer.']"""

However, an apparent increase in high-grade disease was also observed among men randomized to finasteride. We aimed to determine why and hypothesized that there is a grade-dependent response to finasteride.  Methods:   From 2007 to 2012, we randomized dynamically by intranet-accessible software 183 men with localized prostate cancer to receive 5mg finasteride or placebo daily in a double-blind study during the 4-6weeks preceding prostatectomy. As the primary end point, the expression of a predefined molecular signature (ERβ, UBE2C, SRD5A2, and VEGF) differentiating high- and low-grade tumors in Gleason grade (GG) 3 areas of finasteride-exposed tumors from those in GG3 areas of placebo-exposed tumors, adjusted for Gleason score (GS) at prostatectomy, was compared. We also determined androgen receptor (AR) levels, Ki-67, and cleaved caspase 3 to evaluate the effects of finasteride on the expression of its downstream target, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, respectively. The expression of these markers was also compared across grades between and within treatment groups. Logistic regression was used to assess the expression of markers.  Findings:   We found that the predetermined molecular signature did not distinguish GG3 from GG4 areas in the placebo group. However, AR expression was significantly lower in the GG4 areas of the finasteride group than in those of the placebo group. Within the finasteride group, AR expression was also lower in GG4 than in GG3 areas, but not significantly. Expression of cleaved caspase 3 was significantly increased in both GG3 and GG4 areas in the finasteride group compared to the placebo group, although it was lower in GG4 than in GG3 areas in both groups.  Interpretation:   We showed that finasteride's effect on apoptosis and AR expression is tumor grade dependent after short-term intervention. This may explain finasteride's selective suppression of low-grade tumors observed in the PCPT.""","""['Jeri Kim', 'John W Davis', 'Eric A Klein', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Yair Lotan', 'John F Ward', 'Louis L Pisters', 'Joseph W Basler', 'Curtis A Pettaway', 'Andrew Stephenson', 'Elsa M Li Ning Tapia', 'Eleni Efstathiou', 'Xuemei Wang', 'Kim-Anh Do', 'J Jack Lee', 'Ivan P Gorlov', 'Lana A Vornik', 'Ashraful M Hoque', 'Ina N Prokhorova', 'Howard L Parnes', 'Scott M Lippman', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Powel H Brown', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Patricia Troncoso']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Grade-dependent Response to Finasteride in Early Prostate Cancer.', 'Effects of short-term finasteride on apoptotic factors and androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells.', 'Finasteride and high-grade prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Estrogen receptor β and treatment with a phytoestrogen are associated with inhibition of nuclear translocation of EGFR in the prostate.', 'The effects of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors on the natural history, detection and grading of prostate cancer: current state of knowledge.', 'Prevention of prostate cancer with finasteride: US/European perspective.', 'Association of finasteride with prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Histopathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Grade-dependent Response to Finasteride in Early Prostate Cancer.']"""

This pilot clinical trial evaluates a novel high-resolution prostate MRI for detection of small, biopsy-proven prostate tumors.  Methods:   Our team developed a software that can be loaded on any modern MRI to generate high resolution diffusion-weighted imaging sequences (HR-DWI), which were compared to standard diffusion-weighted imaging sequence (S-DWI) in a prospective pilot trial in active surveillance patients. HR-DWI captures the entire volume of the prostate rather than sections, reducing streaking artifacts and geometric distortions. Multiple shots, rather than single shots, are used to differentiate signal and noise, enhancing resolution. All images were read by two radiologists. The primary outcome was the percent of biopsy-proven zones seen in 17 patients. The trial was powered to detect discordant proportions of 0.04 and 0.40 at one-sided alpha=0.05.  Results:   The resolution was defined using standard phantoms. HR-DWI produced a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution when compared to S-DWI. Multiparametric (MP)-MRI incorporating S-DWI was useful for predicting biopsy results (AUC 0.72, Fisher's exact p<0.001); however, using HR-DWI allowed MP-MRI to be more highly predictive of biopsy results (AUC 0.88, Fisher's exact p<0.001). AUC for MP-MRI incorporating HR-DWI was significantly larger than MP-MRI incorporating S-DWI (p=0.002). MP-MRI with HR-DWI had a sensitivity of 95.7% and identified tumor in 22 of 23 zones proven to have cancer on biopsy. In contrast, MP-MRI with S-DWI had a sensitivity of 60.9% and only identified 14 of 23 biopsy-positive zones (p=0.004).  Conclusion:   We developed a novel DWI and evaluated its improved resolution in a clinical setting.

Here we report that co-deletion of Pten and p53 in murine prostate epithelium, often observed in human CRPC, leads to AR-independent CRPC and thus confers de novo resistance to second generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in multiple independent yet complementary preclinical mouse models. In contrast, mechanism-driven co-targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated Warburg effect with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and ULK1-dependent autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) selectively kills cancer cells through intrinsic apoptosis to cause tumor regression in xenograft, leads to a near-complete tumor suppression and remarkably extends survival in Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven CRPC mouse model. Mechanistically, 2-DG causes AMPK phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits mTORC1-S6K1 translation signaling to preferentially block anti-apoptotic protein MCL-l synthesis to prime mitochondria-dependent apoptosis while simultaneously activates ULK1-driven autophagy for cell survival to counteract the apoptotic action of anti-Warburg effect. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagy with CQ sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis upon 2-DG challenge. Given that 2-DG is recommended for phase II clinical trials for prostate cancer and CQ has been clinically used as an anti-malaria drug for many decades, the preclinical results from our proof-of-principle studies in vivo are imminently translatable to clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy by the combination modality for a subset of currently incurable CRPC harboring PTEN and TP53 mutations.""","""['Lei Wang', 'Ji Wang', 'Hua Xiong', 'Fengxia Wu', 'Tian Lan', 'Yingjie Zhang', 'Xiaolan Guo', 'Huanan Wang', 'Mohammad Saleem', 'Cheng Jiang', 'Junxuan Lu', 'Yibin Deng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Inhibition of CAMKK2 impairs autophagy and castration-resistant prostate cancer via suppression of AMPK-ULK1 signaling.', 'Targeting autophagy overcomes Enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and improves therapeutic response in a xenograft model.', 'Androgen deprivation leads to increased carbohydrate metabolism and hexokinase 2-mediated survival in Pten/Tp53-deficient prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hexokinase 2 confers radio-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting autophagy-dependent degradation of AIMP2.', '2-Deoxyglucose and hydroxychloroquine HPLC-MS-MS analytical methods and pharmacokinetic interactions after oral co-administration in male rats.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Glycolysis and Fatty Acid Synthesis in the Activation and T Cell-Modulating Potential of Dendritic Cells Stimulated with a TLR5-Ligand Allergen Fusion Protein.', 'Modulation of dendritic cell metabolism by an MPLA-adjuvanted allergen product for specific immunotherapy.']"""

Since miRNAs regulate several cell processes, including angiogenesis, we sought to determine whether they would influence PGE-2-induced VEGF. We compared DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells bearing the mPGES-1 enzyme (mPGES-1+/+) and producing PGE-2, with those in which the enzyme was silenced or deleted (mPGES-1-/-). We demonstrated that mPGES-1/PGE-2 signaling decreased Dicer expression and miRNA biogenesis. Genome-wide sequencing of miRNAs revealed that miR-15a and miR-186, associated with expression of VEGF and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were down-regulated in mPGES-1+/+ cells. As a consequence, mPGES-1+/+ tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF and HIF-1α, induced endothelial cells activation and formed highly vascularized tumors. Mir-186 mimic inhibited VEGF expression in mPGES-1+/+ tumor xenografts and reduced tumor growth.

Among the multifaceted effects exerted by this program, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton is the key mechanical drive for the invasive properties gained by cancer cells. Collapsin response mediator protein-1 (CRMP1) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein and originally characterized as the mediator of semaphorin 3A signaling involved in axon differentiation during neural development. Here we report that CRMP1 can act as a suppressor of tumorigenicity and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that CRMP1 exhibited a decreased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer tissues and many prostate cancer cell lines, and its downregulation in cancer cells was attributed to histone deacetylation and direct repression of its gene by the EMT regulator Snail. Functional analyses revealed that CRMP1 suppressed EMT in prostate cancer cells, as its knockdown could trigger EMT and enhance in vitro invasion capacity, whereas its overexpression could inhibit EMT and suppress both in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis capacities of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, CRMP1 overexpression could significantly confer resistance to EMT induced by Snail or transforming growth factor-β1 in prostatic epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that CRMP1 could associate with actin and WAVE1, an activator of actin nucleation complex Arp2/3, and also its knockdown could stabilize F-actin and trigger the formation of stress fibers in prostate cancer cells. Together, our study shows that CRMP1 acts an EMT and metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer cells via its regulation of actin polymerization and also suggests that targeting the CRMP1-actin signaling in actin organization could be a potential strategy for management of prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['G Cai', 'D Wu', 'Z Wang', 'Z Xu', 'K-B Wong', 'C-F Ng', 'F L Chan', 'S Yu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'Receptor activator of NF-kappaB Ligand (RANKL) expression is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Stabilization of Snail through AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway is required for TNF-α-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'The HOXD9-mediated PAXIP1-AS1 regulates gastric cancer progression through PABPC1/PAK1 modulation.', 'LCRMP-1 is required for spermatogenesis and stabilises spermatid F-actin organization via the PI3K-Akt pathway.', 'Transcriptomic analysis predicts the risk of progression of premalignant lesions in human tongue.', 'An Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis Based on Nomogram for Predicting Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Incidence.', 'Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-NO signaling axis functions to promote the growth of prostate cancer stem-like cells.']"""

Herein we describe our technique for 3-instrument robotic radical prostatectomy that may decrease costs by limiting the use of disposable instruments.  Results:   Exclusion of the high-cost energy instruments may reduce operative costs by up to 40%. In addition, using 1 robotic needle driver vs 2 may decrease overall costs by another 12%. At our institution, we have adopted these techniques in cost-efficiency and have gone further by only using 3 instruments during robotic radical prostatectomy. The only 3 instruments necessary to perform a successful RALP are a robotic needle driver, Prograsp forceps, and monopolar scissors.

Blood and fresh tissue samples were collected from 322 subjects with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>4ng/ml to determine their genotypes (RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2) and assess messenger ribonucleic acid expression levels (by quantitative amplification testing).  Main findings:   Among clinical parameters, a 63.6% of patients with CC variants in rs11545302 (ELAC2) had PSA>20ng/ml (P = 0.008), and rs486907 (RNASEL), with 52.8% of patients with CT variants with Gleason score>7.

As to environmental factors, the intake of dried fruits (P = 0.036) and practice of sports (P = 0.024) revealed an effect in PCa. Moreover, environmental factors were observed to affect gene expression patterns. Thus, RNASEL (P = 0.018) and ELAC2 (P = 0.023) were found to be underexpressed in patients who ate processed foods frequently; MSR1 (P = 0.024) and AR (P = 0.004) were underexpressed in patients who did not practice sports; and KLK3 (P = 0.039; P = 0.046) underexpressed in patients exposed to dust and toxic products.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to analyze the correlation between RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 genotypes and messenger ribonucleic acid expression in PCa. RNASEL and KLK3 show different expression patterns in normal vs. tumor tissue, which supports their reported relevance in human cancer. The results obtained confirm that RNASEL plays a crucial role in PCa. Environmental factors such as exercise, exposure to toxic agents, and intake of processed foods are associated with PCa.""","""['Maria Jesus Alvarez-Cubero', 'Manrique Pascual-Geler', 'Luis Javier Martinez-Gonzalez', 'Manuela Expósito Ruiz', 'Maria Saiz', 'Jose Manuel Cozar', 'Jose Antonio Lorente']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Single and multivariate associations of MSR1, ELAC2, and RNASEL with prostate cancer in an ethnic diverse cohort of men.', 'Prognostic role of genetic biomarkers in clinical progression of prostate cancer.', 'Association of hereditary prostate cancer gene polymorphic variants with sporadic aggressive prostate carcinoma.', 'Genetic analysis of the principal genes related to prostate cancer: a review.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'The effects of a 20-week exercise program on blood-circulating biomarkers related to brain health in overweight or obese children: The ActiveBrains project.', 'Association between dried fruit intake and pan-cancers incidence risk: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.', 'Carriage of mutations R462Q (rs 486907) and D541E (rs 627928) of the RNASEL gene and risk factors in patients with prostate cancer in Burkina Faso.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'The Impact of African Ancestry on Prostate Cancer Disparities in the Era of Precision Medicine.']"""

Here, we assessed the frequency of malignancies in a large tertiary IBD centre at the University Hospital Zurich.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 1,026 patients from our IBD clinic treated between 2007 and 2014.  Results:   Twenty two of the 1,026 patients developed 28 cases of malignancies, 14 patients were male and 8 patients female. The median latency between IBD diagnosis and first malignancy was 13 years (range 2-27 years). Most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), urothelial carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and prostate cancer. The most common tumour type in Crohn's disease patients (13/22) was lymphoma (5 cases), in ulcerative colitis patients (9/22) CCC (2 cases) and CRC (2 cases). The observed incidence of lymphoma (32.5/100,000), bladder carcinoma (21.7/100,000) and CCC (10.8/100,000) was higher than expected and known from general population. All of the patients that developed a malignancy had received immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to a cohort of 927 IBD patients without malignancies there were no statistical differences regarding gender, antibodies targeting tumour necrosis factor and thiopurine use.

We aimed to compare visually directed MRI-targeted biopsies (MRI-TB) to an accurate reference standard - transperineal prostate mapping (TPM) biopsies with 5 mm sampling - in the detection of clinically significant cancer in men with biochemical failure after radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective registry analysis between 2006 and 2014 identified 77 men who had undergone mpMRI followed by MRI-TB and TPM. Clinical significance was set at two definitions of disease. Definition 1 was Gleason ≥ 4+3 and/or maximum cancer core length ≥ 6 mm. Definition 2 was Gleason ≥ 3+4 and/or maximum cancer core length ≥ 4 mm.  Results:   Of the 77 patients included, the mean age was 70 years (range 61-82; standard deviation 5.03). The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at the time of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was 14 ng/ml (interquartile range 7.83-32.50). The most frequent EBRT dose given was 74 Gy over 37 fractions. Eight patients had iodine-seed implant brachytherapy or high dose rate brachytherapy. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal therapy use was reported in 38. The time from EBRT to biochemical recurrence was a median of 60 months (interquartile range 36.75-85.00). The median PSA at the time of mpMRI was 4.68 ng/ml (interquartile range 2.68-7.60). The median time between mpMRI and biopsy was 2.76 months (interquartile range 1.58-4.34). In total, 2392 TPM and 381 MRI-TB cores were taken with 18% and 50% cancer detection, respectively. Detection rates of definition 1 clinically significant cancer were 52/77 (68%) versus 55/77 (71%) for MRI-TB and TPM, respectively. MRI-TB was more efficient requiring 1 core versus 2.8 cores to detect definition 2 cancer.

Exposure of prostate cancer cells to plasma achievable doses of HNK resulted in a marked decrease in levels of total and/or phosphorylated c-Myc protein as well as its mRNA expression. We also observed suppression of c-Myc protein in PC-3 xenografts upon oral HNK administration. Stable overexpression of c-Myc in PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells conferred significant protection against HNK-mediated growth inhibition and G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest. HNK treatment decreased expression of c-Myc downstream targets including Cyclin D1 and Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), and these effects were partially restored upon c-Myc overexpression. In addition, PC-3 and DU145 cells with stable knockdown of EZH2 were relatively more sensitive to growth inhibition by HNK compared with control cells. Finally, androgen receptor overexpression abrogated HNK-mediated downregulation of c-Myc and its targets particularly EZH2.

It is shown that Mig-6 inhibits cell migration via direct interaction with the ErbB receptors, thereby inhibiting cross-phosphorylation or targeting the receptors for degradation. Mig-6 has also been shown to bind to and inhibit the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to suppress cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Mig-6 inhibits cell migration via Cdc42 is still not entirely clear. Here, we show that Mig-6 binding to Cdc42 is necessary and sufficient to inhibit EGF-induced filopodia formation and migration. This binding, mediated by four specific residues (I11, R12, M26, R30) in the Mig-6 CRIB domain, is essential for Mig-6 function. In addition, ectopic expression of Cdc42 reverses Mig-6 inhibition of cell migration. Mig-6 CRIB domain, alone, is sufficient to inhibit cell migration. Conversely, Mig-6 binding to EGFR is dispensable for Mig-6-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Moreover, we found that decreased Mig-6 expression correlates with cancer progression in breast and prostate cancers. Together, our results demonstrate that Mig-6 inhibition of Cdc42 signaling is critical in Mig-6 function to suppress cell migration and that dysregulation of this pathway may play a critical role in cancer development.""","""['Xinni Jiang', 'MengMeng Niu', 'Deshi Chen', 'Jing Chen', 'Yang Cao', 'Xiaorong Li', 'Haoqiang Ying', 'Johann Bergholz', 'Yujun Zhang', 'Zhi-Xiong Xiao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['IRSp53 coordinates AMPK and 14-3-3 signaling to regulate filopodia dynamics and directed cell migration.', 'Bif-1 suppresses breast cancer cell migration by promoting EGFR endocytic degradation.', 'Emodin inhibits tumor cell migration through suppression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Cdc42/Rac1 pathway.', 'Mig-6, signal transduction, stress response and cancer.', 'Feedback inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways.', 'Pancreatic loss of Mig6 alters murine endocrine cell fate and protects functional beta cell mass in an STZ-induced model of diabetes.', 'Transcriptomics and experimental validation-based approach to understand the effect and mechanism of Huangqin tang interfeience with colitis associated colorectal cancer.', 'Elucidating the pharmacological mechanism by which Si-Wu-Tang induces cellular senescence in breast cancer via multilevel data integration.', 'Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding Containing Effector Proteins in Unicellular Protozoans With Reference to Human Host: Locks of the Rho Signaling.', 'Gene 33/Mig6/ERRFI1, an Adapter Protein with Complex Functions in Cell Biology and Human Diseases.']"""

The miR-99 family has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the DNA damage response, via targeting of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors, SMARCA5 and SMARCD1 in cell line models. In the present study, we have demonstrated that low expression of miR-99a and miR-100 is present in cell populations which are relatively radiation insensitive, for example in prostate cancer stem cells and in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, treatment of cells with the synthetic glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone resulted in decreased miR-99a and 100 expression, suggesting a new mechanism of miR-99a and 100 regulation in androgen-independent prostate cells. Strikingly, treatment of prostate cells with the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor, Mifepristone was found to sensitize prostate cells to radiation by increasing the levels of miR-99a and miR-100.

We also found that SFMBT2 knockdown elevates MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-26 expression, leading to increased cell migration and invasion in LNCaP and VCaP cells.

Results:   Compared with controls over 12months, men receiving ADT had reductions in mean total testosterone level (14.1-0.4nmol/L, P<0.001), mean adjusted gain in fat mass of 3530g (2012, 5047), P<0.02 and loss of lean mass of 1491g (181, 2801), P<0.02. Visceral fat was unchanged. HOMA2-IR in the ADT group increased 0.59 (0.24, 0.94), P=0.02, which was most related to the increase in fat mass (P=0.003), less to lean mass (P=0.09) or total testosterone (P=0.088). Frailty increased with ADT (P<0.0001), which was related to decreased testosterone (P=0.028), and less to fat mass (P=0.056) or lean mass (P=0.79). SPPB was unchanged.  Conclusions:   ADT is associated with increased insulin resistance and frailty within 12months of commencement, independently of confounding effects of cancer or radiotherapy. Insulin resistance appears to be mediated by subcutaneous or peripheral sites of fat deposition. Prevention of fat gain is an important strategy to prevent adverse ADT-associated cardiometabolic risks.""","""['Ada S Cheung', 'Rudolf Hoermann', 'Philippe Dupuis', 'Daryl Lim Joon', 'Jeffrey D Zajac', 'Mathis Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Endocrinol""","""['Persisting adverse body composition changes 2 years after cessation of androgen deprivation therapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life in prostate cancer patients taking androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Time on androgen deprivation therapy and adaptations to exercise: secondary analysis from a 12-month randomized controlled trial in men with prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and metabolic risk for atherosclerosis.', 'The clinical importance of quantifying body fat distribution during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Should clinical trials about prostate cancer assess the frailty as an endpoint?', 'Review of Cardiovascular Risk of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Influence of Race in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'The Roles of Androgens in Humans: Biology, Metabolic Regulation and Health.', 'Metabolic Syndrome and Male Fertility: Beyond Heart Consequences of a Complex Cardiometabolic Endocrinopathy.', 'Frailty and testosterone level in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

To date there is no standardised treatment for managing RUFs. This represents a challenge for surgeons, mainly because of the potential recurrence risk.  Objective:   To describe our minimally invasive transanal repair (MITAR) of RUFs and to assess its safety and outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively evaluated 12 patients who underwent MITAR of RUF at our centre from October 2008 to December 2014. Exclusion criteria were a fistula diameter greater than 1.5cm, sepsis, and/or faecaluria.  Surgical procedure:   After fistula identification through cystoscopy and 5F-catheter positioning within the fistula, MITAR is performed using laparoscopic instruments introduced through Parks' anal retractor. The fibrotic margins of the fistula are carefully dissected by a lozenge incision of the rectal wall, parallel to the rectal axis. Under the healthy flap of the rectal wall the urothelium is located and the fistulous tract is sutured with interrupted stitches. After a leakage test of the bladder, the rectal wall is sutured with interrupted stitches. Electrocoagulation is never used during this procedure.  Measurements:   Fistula closure, postoperative complications, and recurrence.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 21 (range, 12-74) mo. Median operative time was 58 (range, 50-70) min. Median hospital stay was 1.5 (range, 1-4) d. Early surgical complications occurred in one patient (8.3%). Recurrence did not occur in any of the cases. Limitations included retrospective analysis, small case load, and lack of experience with radiation-induced fustulas.  Conclusions:   MITAR is a safe, effective, and reproducible procedure. Its advantages are low morbidity and quick recovery, and no need for a colostomy.  Patient summary:   We studied the treatment of rectourethral fistulas. Our technique, transanally performed using laparoscopic instruments, was found to be safe, feasible, and effective, with limited risk of complications.""","""['Giulio Nicita', 'Donata Villari', 'Simone Caroassai Grisanti', 'Michele Marzocco', 'Vincenzo Li Marzi', 'Alberto Martini']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Intersphincteric approach for rectourethral fistulas following radical prostatectomy.', 'Transanal Minimally Invasive Proctectomy With Two-Stage Turnbull-Cutait Pull-Through Coloanal Anastomosis for Iatrogenic Rectourethral Fistulas.', 'Transanal repair of rectourethral fistula after a radical retropubic prostatectomy: report of a case.', 'Rectourethral fistulas in the cancer survivor.', 'Surgical treatment of rectourinary fistulas: review of the literature.', 'Outcomes of gracilis muscle interposition for rectourethral fistulas caused by treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Management of acquired rectourethral fistulas in adults.', 'St.Gallen consensus on safe implementation of transanal total mesorectal excision.', 'Use of biological mesh in trans-anal treatment for recurrent recto-urethral fistula.']"""

Metabolomic profiling has the potential to discover molecular species relevant to prostate cancer etiology, early detection, and prevention, and may help elucidate the biologic mechanisms through which vitamins influence prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Prostate cancer risk data related to vitamins E, A, and D and metabolomic profiling from clinical, cohort, and nested case-control studies, along with randomized controlled trials, are examined and summarized, along with recent metabolomic data of the vitamin phenotypes.  Results:   Higher vitamin E serologic status is associated with lower prostate cancer risk, and vitamin E genetic variant data support this. By contrast, controlled vitamin E supplementation trials have had mixed results based on differing designs and dosages. Beta-carotene supplementation (in smokers) and higher circulating retinol and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations appear related to elevated prostate cancer risk. Our prospective metabolomic profiling of fasting serum collected 1-20 years prior to clinical diagnoses found reduced lipid and energy/TCA cycle metabolites, including inositol-1-phosphate, lysolipids, alpha-ketoglutarate, and citrate, significantly associated with lower risk of aggressive disease.  Conclusions:   Several active leads exist regarding the role of micronutrients and metabolites in prostate cancer carcinogenesis and risk.

To identify novel HCC biomarkers, we used the WHV/c-myc transgenic (Tg) mice, an animal model of hepatocarcinogenesis. By analyzing their gene expression profiling, we investigated differentially expressed genes in livers of wild-type and Tg mice. The cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP17A1), a hepatic P450 enzyme, was revealed to be overexpressed in the liver tissues of Tg mice at both preneoplastic and neoplastic stages. Mouse-to-human validation demonstrated that CYP17A1 mRNA and protein were also significantly increased in human HCC tissues compared with paired nontumor tissues (P = 0.00041 and 0.00011, respectively). Immunohistochemical studies showed that CYP17A1 was overexpressed in 67% (58 of 87) of HCC, and strong staining of CYP17A1 was observed in well-differentiated HCCs. Consistent with this, the median serum levels of CYP17A1 were also significantly higher in patients with HCC (140.2 ng/mL, n = 776) compared with healthy controls (31.4 ng/mL, n = 366) and to those with hepatitis B virus (57.5 ng/mL, n = 160), cirrhosis (46.1 ng/mL, n = 147), lung cancer (27.4 ng/mL, n = 109), and prostate cancer (42.1 ng/mL, n = 130; all P < 0.001). Notably, the elevations were seen in most AFP-negative HCC cases. Altogether, through mouse-to-human search and validation, we found that CYP17A1 is overexpressed in HCCs and it has great potentiality as a noninvasive marker for HCC detection. These results provide a rationale for the future development and clinical application of CYP17A1 measurement to diagnose HCC more precisely.

In the multicentre phase 3, HYpofractionated irradiation for PROstate cancer (HYPRO) trial, hypofractionated radiotherapy was compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for treatment of prostate cancer. We have previously reported acute and late incidence of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity; here we report protocol-defined 5-year relapse-free survival outcomes.  Methods:   We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at seven Dutch radiotherapy centres. We enrolled patients with intermediate-risk to high-risk T1b-T4NX-N0MX-M0 localised prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 60 μg/L or less, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. We used a web-based application to randomly assign (1:1) patients to either hypofractionated radiotherapy of 64·6 Gy (19 fractions of 3·4 Gy, three fractions per week) or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy of 78·0 Gy (39 fractions of 2·0 Gy, five fractions per week). Based on an estimated α/β ratio for prostate cancer of 1·5 Gy, the equivalent total dose in fractions of 2·0 Gy was 90·4 Gy for hypofractionation compared with 78·0 Gy for conventional fractionation. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all eligible patients. The HYPRO trial completed recruitment in 2010 and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN85138529.  Findings:   Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were enrolled, of whom 804 were eligible and assessable for intention-to-treat analyses. Of these, 407 were assigned hypofractionated radiotherapy and 397 were allocated conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. 537 (67%) of 804 patients received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy for a median duration of 32 months (IQR 10-44). Median follow-up was 60 months (IQR 51-69). Treatment failure was reported in 169 (21%) of 804 patients, 80 (20%) in the hypofractionation group and 89 (22%) in the conventional fractionation group. 5-year relapse-free survival was 80·5% (95% CI 75·7-84·4) for patients assigned hypofractionation and 77·1% (71·9-81·5) for those allocated conventional fractionation (adjusted hazard radio 0·86, 95% CI 0·63-1·16; log-rank p=0·36). There were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   Hypofractionated radiotherapy was not superior to conventional radiotherapy with respect to 5-year relapse-free survival.

We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.  Methods:   CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7·4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3·8 weeks) all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques. Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression. Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1·208. Analysis was by intention to treat. Long-term follow-up continues. The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.  Findings:   Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients). Median follow-up was 62·4 months (IQR 53·9-77·0). The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88·3% (95% CI 86·0-90·2) in the 74 Gy group, 90·6% (88·5-92·3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85·9% (83·4-88·0) in the 57 Gy group. 60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0·84 [90% CI 0·68-1·03], pNI=0·0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1·20 [0·99-1·46], pNI=0·48). Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group. There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures. The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13·7% (111 events) and 9·1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11·9% (105 events) and 11·7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11·3% (95 events) and 6·6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.

Using a high definition MLC (HD MLC), primary and boost VMAT plans with two full arcs were generated for each patient (original plan). After that, by shifting the isocenter position of the 2nd arc by 1.25 mm in the cranio-caudal direction, we simulated fluences made with MLCs with leaf width of 1.25 mm. After shifting, primary and boost plans were generated for each patient (shifted plan). A sum plan was generated by summation of the primary and boost plan for each patient. Dose-volumetric parameters were calculated and compared.  Results:   Both the homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of the shifted plans were better than those of the original plans in primary plans (HI = 0.065 vs. 0.059 with p < 0.001 and CI = 1.056 vs. 1.044 with p = 0.006).

A Recursive Partitioning Analysis""","""Background:   The purpose of this study was to determine whether a ""high-risk"" subpopulation of low-grade (Gleason score ≤6) prostate cancer defined by lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival (bRFS) might be identified within a large population of men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) alone, with mature follow-up.  Patients and methods:   Patients were retrospectively identified for inclusion by cT1-2 prostate cancer managed with RP alone. Exclusion criteria were: Gleason score ≥7 at RP, any pre- or post-RP radiotherapy or hormone therapy, or PSA follow-up <12 months. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates; recursive partitioning by conditional inference analysis was applied to identify variables associated with bRFS.  Results:   From 2002 through 2010, 284 eligible patients were identified. Median age was 60 years (range, 44-76 years), 233 (82%) were cT1c, and median PSA was 5.3 ng/dL (92% ≤10). The median biopsy to RP interval was 50 days (range, 11-410, with 97% <180 days). Eighty patients (28%) had positive margin (M+). At a median follow-up of 92.6 months (range, 16.9-160.9, with 45% followed ≥ 8 years), 32 patients (11%) had PSA failure, with an estimated 8-year bRFS rate of 89%. In univariate analysis, M+, extraprostatic extension, detectable initial post-RP PSA, and longer biopsy to RP interval were significantly associated with lower bRFS. M+ and longer biopsy to RP interval remained significant in multivariable analysis. Recursive partitioning analysis identified M+ as the only stratification factor, with 8-year bRFS estimates of 74% versus 95% for M+ versus margin-negative.  Conclusion:   Gleason score ≤6 prostate cancer managed using RP alone is associated with high rates of bRFS; however, margin positivity predicts early PSA failure rates in >20% of patients.""","""['John M Watkins', 'Darrion L Mitchell', 'J Kyle Russo', 'Sarah L Mott', 'Chad R Tracy', 'Mark C Smith', 'John M Buatti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Is More Always Better?

Given the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that a fish oil-based diet will inhibit TAM infiltration and delay the growth of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Androgen sensitive mouse prostate cancer (MycCaP) allograft tumors were grown in fully immunocompetent FVB mice fed a high- fat fish oil (omega-3) or corn oil (omega-6) diet. Gene expression of markers for immune cell populations, cytokines, chemokines, and signaling pathways were determined by real-time PCR and western blot in tumor tissue. Cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro were measured by MTS assay and flow cytometry.  Results:   Tumor volumes were significantly smaller in mice in ω-3 versus the ω-6 group (P = 0.048). Gene expression of markers for M1 and M2 macrophages (F4/80, iNOS, ARG1), associated cytokines (IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-10), and the chemokine CCL-2 were also lower in the omega-3 group. Correlative in vitro studies were performed in M1 and M2 polarized macrophages and mirrored the in vivo findings. Dietary fish oil and in vitro omega-3 fatty acid administration reduced protein expression of transcription factors in the nuclear factor kappa B pathway leading to a significant decrease in gene expression of downstream targets (Bcl-2, BCL-XL, XIAP, survivin) in MycCap cells.  Conclusions:   These findings underscore the potential of fish oil in modulating the clinical course of human prostate cancer through the immune system. Further preclinical and clinical studies are warranted evaluating fish oil-based therapies for inhibiting the recruitment and function of M1 and M2 tumor infiltrating macrophages.

Because, an adaptive increase in androgen receptor expression following chronic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may underlie this effect, we tested whether men with hormone-sensitive (HS) prostate cancer (PC) would also respond to BAT if given following a 6-month ADT lead-in.  Methods:   Asymptomatic HS PC patients with low metastatic burden or non-metastatic biochemically recurrent disease were enrolled. Following 6-month of ADT, those with a PSA <4 ng/ml went on to receive alternating 3-month cycles of BAT and ADT. BAT was administered as intramuscular testosterone (T) cypionate or enanthate 400 mg on Days (D) 1, 29, and 57. ADT was continued throughout the study to allow rapid cycling from near castrate to supraphysiologic range T following T injections. The primary endpoint was the percent of patients with a PSA <4 ng/ml after 18 months. Secondary endpoints included radiographic response and quality of life (QoL).  Results:   Twenty-nine of 33 patients received BAT following the ADT lead-in. The primary endpoint was met, with 17/29 men (59%, 90% confidence interval: 42-74%) having a PSA <4 ng/ml at 18 months. Ten patients receiving BAT had RECIST evaluable disease, and eight (80%) objective responses were observed (four complete; four partial). Three patients progressed per RECIST criteria and three had unconfirmed progression on bone scan. Men treated with 6-month of ADT had improved QoL following the first cycle of BAT as measured by the SF-36, FACT-P, and IIEF surveys.  Conclusions:   BAT demonstrated preliminary efficacy in men with HS PC following 6-month of ADT. BAT may improve QoL in men treated with ADT.

However, its role in PCa metastasis is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to confirm the association between GPRC6A and aggressive PCa in a case-control analysis, and to explore the function of GPRC6A in PCa metastasis in vitro.  Patients and methods:   The association of 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GPRC6A and linked to GPRC6A were evaluated with PCa risk and aggressive PCa in 916 subjects. Metastasis behavior was determined in GPRC6A knockdown PC3 cells, and the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 were detected. Bone transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker genes were examined in the GPRC6A overexpression PC3 cells.  Results:   Among the 14 SNPs tested in PCa patients and controls, 4 were associated with aggressive PCa (p = 0.032-0.037, odds ratio = 1.38-1.41). Both the migration and invasion abilities were reduced in PC3 cells that were transiently transfected with GPRC6A short interfering RNA (siRNA). The GPRC6A knockdown cells showed reduced activity levels of MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore, RUNX2, EMT and ERK signaling were shown to be up-regulated in GPRC6A overexpression cells.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that GPRC6A is associated with aggressive PCa. GPRC6A knockdown inhibits the PCa cells migration and invasion, and GPRC6A overexpression promotes the EMT.

Such transducers offer the benefits of rapid volumetric imaging, but can cause substantial measurement distortion in electromagnetic tracking sensors, which are commonly used to enable 3-D navigation. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and validation of a 3-D-ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy system that employs high-accuracy optical tracking to localize the ultrasound probe and prostate targets in 3-D physical space.  Methods:   The accuracy of the system was validated by evaluating the targeted needle placement error after inserting a biopsy needle to sample planned targets in a phantom using standard 2-D ultrasound guidance versus real-time 3-D guidance provided by the new system.

Aspirin previously has been found to be associated with reduced carcinogenesis of prostate cells. However, it remains unclear whether regularly taking aspirin could lower the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, our aim was to examine the association between self-reported regular use of aspirin and the prevalence of prostate cancer in a national sample of the US adult population.The National Health Interview Survey is an annual survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics to investigate health and healthcare use of the US population. The current study is a population-based cross-sectional study using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data. Adult male respondents who self-reported regularly taking aspirin at least 3 times per week were grouped as regular users. The prostate cancer prevalence was measured by respondents' self-report of prostate cancer. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between these 2 factors by adjusting for covariates selected based on Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use.An estimated 23 million (23.7%) males in the United States reported that they took aspirin regularly. Of them, 5.0% had prostate cancer. Regular aspirin use was significantly associated with a lower self-reported prevalence of prostate cancer after adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.94).Regular aspirin use was found to be significantly associated with a lower self-reported prevalence of prostate cancer in the United States in 2010.

Therefore, in order to diagnose ED and PE in these populations, adequate and efficient instruments such as the International Index of Erectile Function 5-item version (IIEF-5) and the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) are needed. However, since this is an important topic additional evidence of psychometric properties of the IIEF-5 and the PEDT in such samples are required.

Methods:   Prostate cancer patients (n = 1058, mean±SD age = 64.07±6.84 years) who visited urology clinics were invited to fill out the IIEF-5 and the PEDT. Construct validity was examined using infit and outfit mean square (MnSq) and local dependency using correlations between each two residual Rasch scores. Score order was investigated using step and average measures of difficulty and DIF using DIF contrast.  Results:   All IIEF-5 and PEDT items had acceptable infit and outfit MnSq. Step measures revealed that all but two items had disordered categories in terms of scores 1 to 3. Only one local dependency was found, and no items displayed DIF across age, educational level, and help seeking.  Conclusions:   The results showed that both the IIEF-5 and the PEDT had sound psychometric properties in the Rasch analyses, although some score disordering could be detected in both instruments.

Previous immunohistochemical studies suggest the proliferation marker Ki67 might be a predictor of survival, independently of PSA and Gleason score. We performed a validation study of Ki67 as a marker of survival and disease progression and compared its performance against another candidate biomarker, DLX2, selected using artificial neural network analysis.  Methods:   A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from transurethral resected prostatectomy histology samples (n=192). Artificial neural network analysis was used to identify candidate markers conferring increased risk of death and metastasis in a public cDNA array. Immunohistochemical analysis of the TMA was carried out and univariate and multivariate tests performed to explore the association of tumour protein levels of Ki67 and DLX2 with time to death and metastasis.  Results:   Univariate analysis demonstrated Ki67 as predictive of CaP-specific survival (DSS; P=0.022), and both Ki67 (P=0.025) and DLX2 (P=0.001) as predictive of future metastases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Ki67 as independent of PSA, Gleason score and D'Amico risk category for DSS (HR=2.436, P=0.029) and both Ki67 (HR=3.296, P=0.023) and DLX2 (HR=3.051, P=0.003) as independent for future metastases.

However, the biological pathways between obesity and BPH are unknown. Our objective was to investigate biomarkers of systemic and prostate tissue inflammation as potential mediators of the obesity and BPH association.  Methods:   Participants included 191 men without prostate cancer at prostate biopsy. Trained staff measured weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and body composition by bioelectric impedance analysis. Systemic inflammation was estimated by serum IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α; and by urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGE-M), F2-isoprostane (F2iP), and F2-isoprostane metabolite (F2iP-M) levels. Prostate tissue was scored for grade, aggressiveness, extent, and location of inflammatory regions, and also stained for CD3 and CD20 positive lymphocytes. Analyses investigated the association between multiple body composition scales, systemic inflammation, and prostate tissue inflammation against BPH outcomes, including prostate size at ultrasound and LUTS severity by the AUA-symptom index (AUA-SI).  Results:   Prostate size was significantly associated with all obesity measures. For example, prostate volume was 5.5 to 9.0 mls larger comparing men in the 25th vs. 75th percentile of % body fat, fat mass (kg) or lean mass (kg). However, prostate size was not associated with proinflammatory cytokines, PGE-M, F2iP, F2iP-M, prostate tissue inflammation scores or immune cell infiltration. In contrast, the severity of prostate tissue inflammation was significantly associated with LUTS, such that there was a 7 point difference in AUA-SI between men with mild vs. severe inflammation (p = 0.004). Additionally, men with a greater waist-hip ratio (WHR) were significantly more likely to have severe prostate tissue inflammation (p = 0.02), and a high WHR was significantly associated with moderate/severe LUTS (OR = 2.56, p = 0.03) among those participants with prostate tissue inflammation.  Conclusion:   The WHR, an estimate of centralized obesity, was associated with the severity of inflammatory regions in prostate tissue and with LUTS severity among men with inflammation. Our results suggest centralized obesity advances prostate tissue inflammation to increase LUTS severity. Clinically targeting centralized fat deposition may reduce LUTS severity. Mechanistically, the lack of a clear relationship between systemic inflammatory or oxidative stress markers in blood or urine with prostate size or LUTS suggests pathways other than systemic inflammatory signaling may link body adiposity to BPH outcomes.""","""['Jay H Fowke', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Oluwole Fadare', 'Peter E Clark']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Molecular correlates in urine for the obesity and prostatic inflammation of BPH/LUTS patients.', 'Urine chemokines indicate pathogenic association of obesity with BPH/LUTS.', 'Does Prostate Size Predict the Development of Incident Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men with Mild to No Current Symptoms?

Materials/methods:   From March 2007 to January 2015, 421 consecutive patients with prostate cancer (PCa) underwent preoperative MP-MRI and RP. BCR-free survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify clinical and imaging variables predictive of BCR.

Inserting such technology into the human body creates cybernetic organisms; a cyborg that is a human-machine hybrid. There is a gap in knowledge relating to patient willingness to allow automated technology to be embedded and to become cyborg. There is little agreement around what makes a cyborg and less understanding of the variation in the cyborgisation process. Understanding the viewpoint of possible beneficiaries addresses such gaps. There are currently three versions of 'cyborg' in the literature (i) a critical feminist STS concept to destabilise power inherent in dualisms, (ii) an extreme version of the human/machine in science-fiction that emphasises the 'man' in human and (iii) a prediction of internal physiological adaptation required for future space exploration. Interview study findings with 12 men in remission from prostate cancer show a fourth version can be used to describe current and future sub-groups of the population; 'everyday cyborgs'. For the everyday cyborg the masculine cyborg status found in the fictionalised human-machine related to issues of control of the cancer. This was preferred to the felt stigmatisation of being a 'leaker and bleeder'. The willingness to become cyborg was matched with a having to get used to the everyday cyborg's technological adaptations and risks. It is crucial to explore the everyday cyborg's sometimes ambivalent viewpoint. The everyday cyborg thus adds the dimension of participant voice currently missing in existing cyborg literatures and imaginations.""","""['Gill Haddow', 'Emma King', 'Ian Kunkler', 'Duncan McLaren']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Sci Cult (Lond)""","""['A cyborg ontology in health care: traversing into the liminal space between technology and person-centred practice.', 'From disabled tourists to impaired cyborg tourists: What would it take to transform?', 'Intelligence-Augmented Rat Cyborgs in Maze Solving.', 'Embodiment and everyday cyborgs: Technologies that alter subjectivity Internet.', 'A New Era for Cyborg Science Is Emerging: The Promise of Cyborganic Beings.', 'Biomedicine, self and society: An agenda for collaboration and engagement.', 'Horizon scanning implanted biosensors in personalising breast cancer management: First pilot study of breast cancer patients views.', ""Learning from deep brain stimulation: the fallacy of techno-solutionism and the need for 'regimes of care'."", 'New risks inadequately managed: the case of smart implants and medical device regulation.', ""Implantable Smart Technologies (IST): Defining the 'Sting' in Data and Device.""]"""

The results revealed that, in CP/CPPS patients with significant MHD, elevated IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α serum levels were observed. The above five cytokines in CP/CPPS rats were significantly elevated in prostate tissue (p < 0.05), and IL-1β levels were elevated in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. In behavioral tests, CP/CPPS rats showed anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, and impaired spatial and associative memory performance (p < 0.05). In the CP/CPPS group, ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were increased in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, and decreased in the hippocampus, but not caudate nucleus.

Methods:   A randomized, prospective clinical trial was performed including 160 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy after randomization into two groups: intraoperatively, a transurethral catheter (control group) or an additional suprapubic tube (with removal of the transurethral catheter in the morning of postoperative day 1; intervention group) was placed. Primary study endpoint was postoperative pain objectified by the numeric rating scale questionnaire. Secondary endpoints were bacteriuria after catheter removal and functional outcomes after up to 2 years of follow-up.  Results:   There were no significant differences in demographic and perioperative data.

Currently, computed tomography (CT) is used to delineate the prostate and to plan the radiotherapy treatment. However, CT images suffer from a poor soft-tissue contrast and do not allow an accurate organ delineation. On the contrary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides rich details and high soft-tissue contrast, allowing tumor detection. Thus, the intraindividual propagation of MRI delineations toward the planning CT may improve tumor targeting. In this paper, we introduce a new method to propagate MRI prostate delineations to the planning CT. In the first step, a random forest classification is performed to coarsely detect the prostate in the CT images, yielding a prostate probability membership for each voxel and a prostate hard segmentation. Then, the registration is performed using a new similarity metric which maximizes the probability and the collinearity between the normals of the manual registration (MR) existing contour and the contour resulting from the CT classification. The first study on synthetic data was performed to analyze the influence of the metric parameters with different levels of noise. Then, the method was also evaluated on real MR-CT data using manual alignments and intraprostatic fiducial markers and compared to a classically used mutual information (MI) approach. The proposed metric outperformed MI by 7% in terms of Dice score coefficient, by 3.14 mm the Hausdorff distance, and 2.13 mm the markers position errors. Finally, the impact of registration uncertainties on the treatment planning was evaluated, demonstrating the potential advantage of the proposed approach in a clinical setup to define a precise target.""","""['Frederic Commandeur', 'Antoine Simon', 'Romain Mathieu', 'Mohamed Nassef', 'Juan David Ospina Arango', 'Yan Rolland', 'Pascal Haigron', 'Renaud de Crevoisier', 'Oscar Acosta']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""IEEE J Biomed Health Inform""","""['Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Use and uncertainties of mutual information for computed tomography/ magnetic resonance (CT/MR) registration post permanent implant of the prostate.', 'Fiducial marker for prostate radiotherapy: comparison of 0.35- and 0.5-mm-diameter computed tomography and magnetic resonance images.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Prostate cancer: image guidance and adaptive therapy.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.', 'Urethral Interfractional Geometric and Dosimetric Variations of Prostate Cancer Patients: A Study Using an Onboard MRI.', 'Deformable MR-CBCT prostate registration using biomechanically constrained deep learning networks.', 'Geometric and dosimetric impact of anatomical changes for MR-only radiation therapy for the prostate.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1997 and 2012 and underwent curative treatment were selected from the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden. For each included man, five prostate cancer-free controls, matched for birth year and county of residency, were randomly selected. In total, 12,534 men underwent RT, 24,886 underwent RP and 186,624 were controls. Adverse effects were defined according to surgical and diagnostic codes in the National Patient Registry. The relative risk (RR) of adverse effects up to 12 years after treatment was compared to controls and the risk was subsequently compared between RT and RP in multivariable analyses.  Results:   Men with intermediate- and localized high-risk cancer who underwent curative treatment had an increased risk of adverse effects during the full study period compared to controls: the RR of undergoing a procedures after RT was 2.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56-2.73] and after RP 2.05 (95% CI 2.00-2.10). The risk remained elevated 10-12 years after treatment. For all risk categories of prostate cancer, the risk of surgical procedures for urinary incontinence was higher after RP (RR 23.64, 95% CI 11.71-47.74), whereas risk of other procedures on the lower urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract or abdominal wall was higher after RT (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.44-1.94, and RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.70-2.02, respectively).

In this study, we aimed to present a detailed biodistribution of Ga-PSMA-11, including physiological and benign variants of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging.  Materials and methods:   We carried out a retrospective analysis of 40 patients who underwent PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging and who had no evidence of residual or metastatic disease on the scans. In addition, 16 patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT imaging with any indication other than prostate cancer were included in the study to evaluate physiological uptake in the normal prostate gland. The median, minimum-maximum, and mean standardized uptake value (SUV) values were calculated for visceral organs, bone marrow and lymph nodes, and mucosal areas. Any physiological variants or benign lesions with Ga-PSMA-11 were also noted.  Results:   Ga-PSMA-11 uptake was noted in the kidneys, parotid and submandibular glands, duodenum, small intestines, spleen, liver, and lacrimal glands, and mucosal uptake in the nasopharynx, vocal cords, pancreas, stomach, mediastinal blood pool, thyroid gland, adrenal gland, rectum, vertebral bone marrow, and testes. Celiac ganglia showed slight Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in 24 of 40 patients without the presence of any other pathologic lymph nodes in abdominal and pelvic areas. Variable uptake of Ga-PSMA-11 was observed in calcified choroid plexus, a thyroid nodule, an adrenal nodule, axillary lymph nodes and celiac ganglia, occasional osteophytes, and gallbladder. The patient group with PSMA PET/CT for indications other than prostate cancer (n=16) showed a slight radiotracer uptake in normal prostate gland (SUVmax: 5.5±1.6, range: 3.5-8.3).

In search for new NSCLC treatment options, we screened a cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) library for cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells and identified several CAD antihistamines as inducers of lysosomal cell death. We then performed a cohort study on the effect of CAD antihistamine use on mortality of patients diagnosed with non-localized cancer in Denmark between 1995 and 2011. The use of the most commonly prescribed CAD antihistamine, loratadine, was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality among patients with non-localized NSCLC or any non-localized cancer when compared with use of non-CAD antihistamines and adjusted for potential confounders. Of the less frequently described CAD antihistamines, astemizole showed a similar significant association with reduced mortality as loratadine among patients with any non-localized cancer, and ebastine use showed a similar tendency. The association between CAD antihistamine use and reduced mortality was stronger among patients with records of concurrent chemotherapy than among those without such records. In line with this, sub-micromolar concentrations of loratadine, astemizole and ebastine sensitized NSCLC cells to chemotherapy and reverted multidrug resistance in NSCLC, breast and prostate cancer cells.

Here we show that the ligand I-CBP112 can stimulate nucleosome acetylation up to 3-fold while CBP30 does not. Activation of p300/CBP by I-CBP112 is not observed with the isolated histone H3 substrate but requires a nucleosome substrate. I-CBP112 does not impact nucleosome acetylation by the isolated p300 HAT domain, and the effects of I-CBP112 on p300/CBP can be neutralized by CBP30, suggesting that I-CBP112 likely allosterically activates p300/CBP through bromodomain interactions. Using mass spectrometry and Western blots, we have found that I-CBP112 particularly stimulates acetylation of Lys18 of histone H3 (H3K18) in nucleosomes, an established in vivo site of p300/CBP. In addition, we show that I-CBP112 enhances H3K18 acetylation in acute leukemia and prostate cancer cells in a concentration range commensurate with its antiproliferative effects. Our findings extend the known pharmacology of bromodomain ligands in the regulation of p300/CBP and suggest a novel approach to modulating histone acetylation in cancer.""","""['Beth E Zucconi', 'Birgit Luef', 'Wei Xu', 'Ryan A Henry', 'Ilana M Nodelman', 'Gregory D Bowman', 'Andrew J Andrews', 'Philip A Cole']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Structural insight into the recognition of acetylated histone H3K56ac mediated by the bromodomain of CREB-binding protein.', 'Distinct roles of GCN5/PCAF-mediated H3K9ac and CBP/p300-mediated H3K18/27ac in nuclear receptor transactivation.', 'Differences in specificity and selectivity between CBP and p300 acetylation of histone H3 and H3/H4.', 'Recent Advances in the Development of CBP/p300 Bromodomain Inhibitors.', 'Genomic occupancy of the transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP.', 'High-Throughput Identification of Epigenetic Compounds to Enhance Chicken Host Defense Peptide Gene Expression.', 'EP300 Selectively Controls the Enhancer Landscape of MYCN-Amplified Neuroblastoma.', 'p300 suppresses the transition of myelodysplastic syndromes to acute myeloid leukemia.', 'CBP/p300 Bromodomain Inhibitor-I-CBP112 Declines Transcription of the Key ABC Transporters and Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Chemotherapy Drugs.', 'Controlling Intramolecular Interactions in the Design of Selective, High-Affinity Ligands for the CREBBP Bromodomain.']"""

Using the PBCre+;Ptenloxp/loxp;PBCav-1+ mouse model we found that Cav-1 induction increased cancer incidence and growth, and ACC1-FASN expression in intact and castrated mice. We demonstrated that Cav-1 regulated ACC1 and FASN expression in an AR-independent way and increased palmitate synthesis using western blot analysis, qRT-PCR and mass spectrometry in vitro. By using FASN siRNA and C-75, we found that FASN inhibition was more effective in Cav-1-overexpressing cells. This inhibition was abrogated by ACC1si RNA, revealing the role of malonyl-CoA, an ACC1 product, as a mediator of cytotoxicity. Cav-1 was associated with ACC1 in human tumors and ACC1, FASN, and Cav-1 expression were increased in metastatic PCa compared to primary tumors and normal prostate epithelium. Palmitoleate and oleate levels were higher in BMA from patients with metastatic PCa who responded poorly to abiraterone acetate.

We have earlier proposed that the interaction of phenolic-antioxidants with intracellular copper leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately serve as DNA cleaving agents. To further validate our hypothesis we show here that the antioxidant gossypol and its semi-synthetic derivative apogossypolone induce copper-mediated apoptosis in breast MDA-MB-231, prostate PC3 and pancreatic BxPC-3 cancer cells, through the generation of ROS. MCF10A breast epithelial cells refractory to the cytotoxic property of these compounds become sensitized to treatment against gossypol, as well as apogossypolone, when pre-incubated with copper.

We also identified Kidins220 as a target gene directly regulated by miR-4638-5p and shRNA-mediated knockdown of Kidins220 phenocopied miR-4638-5p restoration. Subsequently, we revealed that Kidins220 activates PI3K/AKT pathway, which plays a key role in CRPC. Loss of miR- 4638-5p may lead to CRPC through the activity of Kidins220 and PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, we found that miR-4638-5p, through regulating Kidins220 and the downstream activity of VEGF and PI3K/AKT pathway, influences prostate cancer progression via angiogenesis. The identification of miR-4638-5p down-regulation in CRPC and the understanding of the functional role of miR-4638-5p and its downstream genes/pathways have the potential to develop biomarkers for CRPC onset and to identify novel targets for novel forms of treatments of this lethal form of PCa.""","""['Yang Wang', 'Ning Shao', 'Xueying Mao', 'Minmin Zhu', 'Weifei Fan', 'Zhixiang Shen', 'Rong Xiao', 'Chuncai Wang', 'Wenping Bao', 'Xinyu Xu', 'Chun Yang', 'Jian Dong', 'Deshui Yu', 'Yan Wu', 'Caixia Zhu', 'Liting Wen', 'Xiaojie Lu', 'Yong-Jie Lu', 'Ninghan Feng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MiR-361-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-6(STAT6).', 'MiR-1247-5p is overexpressed in castration resistant prostate cancer and targets MYCBP2.', 'Pirin: a potential novel therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer regulated by miR-455-5p.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer progression and androgen deprivation therapy resistance.', 'Kidins220 sets the threshold for survival of neural stem cells and progenitors to sustain adult neurogenesis.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Role of noncoding RNA in drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'miRNAs as Therapeutic Tools and Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer: the framework of malignant behavior.']"""

Objective:   We report on 10 yr of follow-up of men on AS in the PRIAS study and evaluate if criteria used to recommend a switch to active treatment truly predict unfavorable outcome on subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with low-risk prostate cancer were included and followed prospectively on AS. Follow-up consisted of regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies. Men with Gleason >3+3, more than two positive biopsy cores, or stage higher than cT2 were advised to switch to active treatment (until 2014, a PSA doubling time [PSA DT] of 0-3 yr was also used).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Reclassification rates, treatment after discontinuation, and outcome on RP after discontinuing AS were reported. Regression analysis on the outcome of RP was used to evaluate the predictive value of criteria currently used to recommend a switch to active treatment. Kaplan-Meier and competing risk analysis were used to report discontinuation rates over time and long-term oncologic end points.  Results and limitations:   A total of 5302 men were included in PRIAS across 18 countries. Reclassification rates remained stable on all subsequent biopsies, with 22-33% of men having either Gleason >3+3 or more than two positive cores on any repeat biopsy. At 5 and 10 yr of follow-up, 52% and 73% of men, respectively, had discontinued AS, most of them because of protocol-based reclassification. A third of men undergoing subsequent RP had favorable pathologic tumor features (Gleason 3+3 and pT2). Of the criteria used to recommend a switch to active treatment, more than two positive cores and a PSA DT of 0-3 yr were not predictive of unfavorable pathologic outcome on RP.  Conclusions:   A substantial group of men discontinued AS without subsequent unfavorable tumor features on RP; therefore, we propose Gleason upgrading and cT3 as the only indicators for an immediate switch to active treatment. Surrogate indicators (eg, more than two positive cores and a fast-rising PSA) should not trigger immediate active treatment but rather further investigation to confirm the suspicion of higher risk disease.  Patient summary:   We confirmed the safety of active surveillance as a treatment option for men with low-risk prostate cancer; however, some changes could be made to the follow-up protocol to safely increase the number of men who remain on active surveillance.""","""['Leonard P Bokhorst', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Yoshiyuki Kakehi', 'Tom Pickles', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Monique J Roobol;PRIAS study group']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Thoughts on Criteria for Active Surveillance of Favorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Compliance Rates with the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) Protocol and Disease Reclassification in Noncompliers.', 'Value of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Biopsies in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance After 1 Yr Follow-up.', 'Adverse Disease Features in Gleason Score 3 + 4 ""Favorable Intermediate-Risk"" Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Is Active Surveillance Too Active?', 'Variations in the Uptake of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer and Its Impact on Outcomes.', 'The direct prognosis comparison of 125I low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Comparison of Outcomes of Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Versus Low-Risk Localised Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

This analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate bevacizumab pharmacokinetics and the influence of patient variables on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics.  Methods:   Rich and sparse bevacizumab serum concentrations were collected from Phase I through IV studies in early and metastatic cancers. Bevacizumab was given intravenously as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for single- and multiple-dose schedules.  Results:   Model-building used 8943 bevacizumab concentrations from 1792 patients with colon/colorectal, non-small cell lung, kidney, pancreatic, breast, prostate and brain cancer. Bevacizumab doses ranged from 1 to 20 mg/kg given once every 1, 2 or 3 weeks. A two-compartment model best described the data. The population estimates of clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V1) and half-life for a typical 70-kg patient were 9.01 mL/h, 2.88 L and 19.6 days. CL and V1 increased with body weight and were higher in males than females by 14 and 18 %, respectively. CL decreased with increasing albumin and decreasing alkaline phosphatase. The final model was externally validated using 1670 concentrations from 146 Japanese patients that were not used for model-building. Mean prediction errors were -2.1, 3.1 and 1.0 % for concentrations, CL and V1, respectively, confirming adequate predictive performance.  Conclusions:   A robust bevacizumab pharmacokinetic model was developed and externally validated, which may be used to simulate bevacizumab exposure to optimize dosing strategies.

Recent studies suggest that cellular plasticity plays a key role in therapy resistance. Yet little is known about the cellular changes of human prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In this study, we investigated cellular senescence, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), and anti-oxidant responses. Hormone ablation upregulated senescence-associated (SA)-β-Gal activity in prostate glands, as well as the expressions of p27KIP1 and p53, in a mouse castration model. In line with this, the expressions of p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 were significantly more upregulated in human non-pathological prostatic glands after ADT than in untreated specimens. In a study of SASP markers, the expressions of IL6 and IL8 were also more upregulated in human non-pathological prostatic glands after ADT than in untreated specimens. IL6, IL8, and MMP2 were expressed more strongly in human prostate cancer specimens resected after ADT than in untreated tumors. Of note, treatment with the anti-oxidant reagent NAC significantly suppressed SA-β-Gal activity in androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. In immunohistochemical analyses on anti-oxidant response genes, NRF2 and NQO1 were more upregulated after hormone ablation in human prostate gland and carcinoma specimens after ADT than in untreated specimens or in murine prostate glands after castration. Taken together, these findings suggest that ADT induces cellular senescence processes accompanied by secretory phenotypes and anti-oxidant responses in prostate. These cellular changes may be attractive targets for preventing endocrine resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Hirotoshi Kawata', 'Tomoko Kamiakito', 'Takeo Nakaya', 'Maiko Komatsubara', 'Kenji Komatsu', 'Tatsuo Morita', 'Yasumitsu Nagao', 'Akira Tanaka']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Androgen-deprivation induced senescence in prostate cancer cells is permissive for the development of castration-resistance but susceptible to senolytic therapy.', 'Persistence of senescent prostate cancer cells following prolonged neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation induces senescence characteristics in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Senescence and castration resistance in prostate cancer: A review of experimental evidence and clinical implications.', 'Intra-prostatic androgen levels during various androgen-blockade regimens.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Bone marrow niche ATP levels determine leukemia-initiating cell activity via P2X7 in leukemic models.', 'Prostate carcinogenesis: inflammatory storms.', 'Therapy-Induced Senescence: An ""Old"" Friend Becomes the Enemy.']"""

While previous studies have focused on inequalities within countries, the aim of the present study was to quantify existing inequalities in cancer incidence and mortality between countries.  Methods:   Data on total and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality in 2003-2007 were obtained for 43 countries with medium-to-high levels of human development via Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol. X and the WHO Mortality Database. We calculated the concentration index as a summary measure of socioeconomic-related inequality between countries.  Results:   Inequalities in cancer burden differed markedly by site; the concentration index for all sites combined was 0.03 for incidence and 0.02 for mortality, pointing towards a slightly higher burden in countries with higher levels of the human development index (HDI). For both incidence and mortality, this pattern was most pronounced for melanoma. In contrast, the burden of cervical cancer was disproportionally high in countries with lower HDI levels. Prostate, lung and breast cancer contributed most to inequalities in overall cancer incidence in countries with higher HDI levels, while for mortality these were mostly driven by lung cancer in higher HDI countries and stomach cancer in countries with lower HDI levels.  Conclusion:   Global inequalities in the burden of cancer remain evident at the beginning of the twenty-first century: with a disproportionate burden of lifestyle-related cancers in countries classified as high HDI, while infection-related cancers continue to predominate in transitioning countries with lower levels of HDI.""","""['Melina Arnold', 'Elisenda Rentería', 'David I Conway', 'Freddie Bray', 'Tom Van Ourti', 'Isabelle Soerjomataram']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Human Development Inequality Index and Cancer Pattern: a Global Distributive Study.', 'Global incidence and mortality rates in pancreatic cancer and the association with the Human Development Index: decomposition approach.', 'Global cancer transitions according to the Human Development Index (2008-2030): a population-based study.', 'The global cancer burden and human development: A review.', 'Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates and Trends--An Update.', 'A nationally quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of partial organized breast and cervical cancer screening programme on participation and inequalities.', 'An Asian Body to Tackle Cancers in Asia - The Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance.', 'Immigration, screening, and cervical cancer incidence: an application of Age-Period-Cohort analysis.', 'Epidemiological science and cancer control.', 'Alternative Splicing in Breast Cancer and the Potential Development of Therapeutic Tools.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of MeAIB PET for the assessment of prostate cancer, compared with FDG PET.  Methods:   Thirty-four men (age range 57-77 years) with prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled, and underwent MeAIB PET and FDG PET between January 2011 and January 2013. MeAIB PET and FDG PET were performed at 20 and 50 min post-injection, respectively. SUVmax of the prostate was calculated, and visual analysis was conducted for MeAIB and FDG PET studies. MRI images were visually evaluated if available. All patients received total prostatectomy subsequently, and imaging findings were compared with pathological results, including T stage, Gleason score, and tumor size. The patient-based and lesion-based sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to pathological significant cancer.  Results:   Mean value of SUVmax of (11)C-MeAIB PET and (18)F-FDG PET in prostate cancer were 3.18 (±1.90, range; 1.55-9.57) and 3.88 (±2.85, range; 2.04-14.47). MeAIB PET and FDG PET were positive by visual analysis in 47.1 % (16/34) and 44.1 % (15/34) of the patients. MRI was positive in 51.5 % (17/33). Pathological stage and Gleason score were as follows: Stage 2 (n = 23), 3 (n = 8), and 4 (n = 3); Gleason score 6 (n = 13), 7 (n = 16), 8 (n = 3), and 9 (n = 2). The sensitivities tended to be higher according to higher pathological T stage or Gleason sum score for both MeAIB and FDG PET studies. Visual analysis of both MeAIB PET and FDG PET had significant correlation with extraprostatic extension (p < 0.05). MeAIB PET and FDG PET had complementary results by visual analysis in the assessment of prostate cancer. The patient-based sensitivity of MeAIB PET, FDG PET, and MRI were 51.6, 48.4, and 56.7 %, respectively. The patient-based specificity of these modalities was 100 % for each modality.  Conclusions:   MeAIB PET has better diagnostic results than FDG PET for the assessment of significant prostate cancer, and these PET studies showed complementary results.

Materials and methods:   We used Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1) cases to assess prostate specific antigen production by benign prostate tissue in cases with low volume cancer that did not influence prostate specific antigen and in those with high volume cancer in which gland weight did not influence prostate specific antigen. We then created age, prostate specific antigen and prostate weight adjusted cohorts to demonstrate tumor volume per 1 ng/ml prostate specific antigen and 1 μg prostate specific antigen mass. Prostate specific antigen density and prostate specific antigen mass density were used to adjust for prostate weight.  Results:   Comparison of 58 black and 301 white men with low volume cancer demonstrated equal prostate specific antigen production by benign prostate tissue. Comparison of 30 black and 75 white men with high volume cancer indicated that prostate specific antigen was being driven by cancer volume, with lower prostate specific antigen production in black men. In the cohort of 54 black and 134 white men matched by age, prostate specific antigen and prostate weight, tumor volume per 1 ng/ml prostate specific antigen or 1 μg prostate specific antigen mass adjusted for prostate weight was 25% and 26% higher in black men, respectively.  Conclusions:   Benign prostate tissue produces equal amounts of prostate specific antigen in black and white men. Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1) prostate cancer produces less prostate specific antigen in black men.

The main objective of this study was to describe the use of PSA in daily practice by primary care physicians in our area, dealing with aspects such as the importance of patient age, the value in the screening for prostate cancer, or the subjective beliefs about its usefulness. A secondary objective was the comparison of use, and beliefs among doctors who claim to know PSA well, and those who do not.  Patients and methods:   A descriptive and comparative study was conducted using questionnaires that were handed to primary care doctors in all health centres in our area. A descriptive analysis was performed and response rates among doctors who thought they had enough information about PSA, and those who did not, were compared using the Chi-squared test.  Results:   A total of 103 questionnaires were received from the physicians, with 83.5% claiming to have sufficient knowledge about the PSA. The professionals in this latter group request PSA at an earlier age (P=.029), with a higher frequency (P=.011) and have more doubts about its usefulness (P=.009) than those with less knowledge. Almost half (49.5%) said they request less than 50 determinations per year, and 33% between 50 and 100. More than half (53.4%) of doctors would not request the first PSA on a patient until their 50s, and up to 49% request it up to 80 years. The true value of PSA has been established many times by 64.1% of requesters, and 29.1% believe it is unhelpful in the diagnosis of cancer.  Conclusions:   In our study, 64% of primary care physicians have considered the true value of the PSA several times, and 29% believe it to be of little use in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In addition, some data suggest it has limited use due to the fact that 50% made less than 50 PSA requests per years, and 28% of the professionals would never request it on a male without urinary symptoms. In this study, it has been observed that those professionals who claim not to have enough information about the PSA make more requests in patients of an older age, and consider that it is of limited use as a marker.""","""['J Panach-Navarrete', 'A Gironés-Montagud', 'E Sánchez-Cano', 'C Doménech-Pérez', 'J M Martínez-Jabaloyas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Semergen""","""['Use of prostate specific antigen in primary care.', 'Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen: The views of general and laboratory physicians.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', ""Factors influencing primary care physicians' decision to order prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for men without prostate cancer."", 'Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), yet how much damage?.', 'Relevance of total PSA and free PSA prescriptions.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 25 patients with high-risk prostate cancer had surgery first followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy and androgen deprivation. Four treatment planning were simulated for each patient, based on two CT scans performed before and after surgery. The target volumes were: prostate-seminal vesicles-lymph nodes, prostate-lymph nodes, prostate-seminal vesicles and prostate only. The total dose was 46Gy in the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, and 80Gy in the prostate.  Results:   Compared to prostate target volume only, the addition of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes multiplied by a factor of 1.6 and 6.5 the target volume, respectively. Decreasing the target volume from prostate-seminal vesicles-lymph nodes to prostate-seminal vesicles, to prostate only decreased the rectal wall mean dose from 49Gy to 42Gy, to 36Gy, and the risk of late rectal bleeding from 4.4% to 3.2%, to 2.4% (P<0.05), respectively. The bladder wall mean dose decreased from 51Gy to 40Gy, to 35Gy (P<0,05), respectively. Not irradiating the lymph nodes decreased the absolute risk of diarrhea by 11%.

Objective:   To assess the efficacy and safety of radium-223 dichloride (radium-223) versus placebo in ALSYMPCA patients by baseline opioid use.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nine hundred and twenty one patients enrolled at 136 centers globally.  Intervention:   Radium-223 (50 kBq/kg, intravenous injection) every 4 wk for six cycles or matching placebo, each plus best standard of care.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary endpoint (overall survival [OS]), main secondary efficacy endpoints, and safety were evaluated by baseline opioid use. Additional analyses included time to first opioid use, time to first external beam radiation therapy for bone pain, and safety of concomitant external beam radiation therapy.  Results and limitations:   At baseline, 408 (44%) patients had no pain and no analgesic use or mild pain with nonopioid therapy (World Health Organization ladder pain score 0-1 [nonopioid subgroup]), and 513 (56%) had moderate pain with occasional opioids or severe pain with regular daily opioids (World Health Organization ladder pain score 2-3 [opioid subgroup]).

Methods:   Clinical encounters (n = 257) were recorded as part of a larger study of prostate cancer decision making. We used an iterative process to create the 5-point Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS). To determine reliability, research assistants double-coded 50 transcripts. To establish content validity, we used 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether relative treatment recommendation scores differed as a function of which treatment patients received. To establish concurrent validity, we examined whether patients' perceived treatment recommendations matched our coded recommendations.

The average relative treatment recommendation score for each treatment was higher for individuals who received that particular treatment. For example, the average relative surgery recommendation score was higher for individuals who received surgery versus radiation (mean difference = 0.98, SE = 0.18, P < 0.001) or active surveillance (mean difference = 1.10, SE = 0.14, P < 0.001). Patients' perceived recommendations matched coded recommendations 81% of the time.  Conclusion:   The PhyReCS is a reliable and valid way to capture the strength of physician recommendations. We believe that the PhyReCS would be helpful for other researchers who wish to study physician recommendations, an important part of patient decision making.""","""['Karen A Scherr', 'Angela Fagerlin', 'Lillie D Williamson', 'J Kelly Davis', 'Ilona Fridman', 'Natalie Atyeo', 'Peter A Ubel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Physician Recommendations Trump Patient Preferences in Prostate Cancer Treatment Decisions.', 'Informed Decision Making: Assessment of the Quality of Physician Communication about Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Quality of physician-patient relationships is associated with the influence of physician treatment recommendations among patients with prostate cancer who chose active surveillance.', ""Patient preferences versus physicians' judgement: does it make a difference in healthcare decision making?"", 'Decision-Making in Prostate Cancer – Choosing Active Surveillance Over Other Treatment Options: A Literature Review.', ""Two Specialists, Two Recommendations: Discordance Between Urologists' & Radiation Oncologists' Prostate Cancer Treatment Recommendations."", ""Gain-loss framing and patients' decisions: a linguistic examination of information framing in physician-patient conversations."", 'Physician Recommendations Trump Patient Preferences in Prostate Cancer Treatment Decisions.']"""

Method:   Female athymic nude mice with human prostate PC-3 M-luciferase cells grown subcutaneously into the right hind leg were randomized into six groups: saline (+/- heat), free docetaxel (+/- heat), and LTSL docetaxel (+/- heat). Treatment (15 mg docetaxel/kg) was administered via tail vein once tumors reached a size of 200-300 mm(3). Mice tumor volumes and body weights were recorded for up to 60 days. Docetaxel concentrations of harvested tumor and organ/tissue homogenates were determined by LC-MS. Histological evaluation (Mean vessel density, Ki67 proliferation, Caspase-3 apoptosis) of saline, free Docetaxel and LTSL docetaxel (+/- heat n = 3-5) was performed to determine molecular mechanism responsible for tumor cell killing.  Result:   LTSL/heat resulted in significantly higher tumor docetaxel concentrations (4.7-fold greater compared to free docetaxel). Adding heat to LTSL Docetaxel or free docetaxel treatment resulted in significantly greater survival and growth delay compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). Differences in body weight between all Docetaxel treatments were not reduced by >10% and were not statistically different from each other. Molecular markers such as caspase-3 were upregulated, and Ki67 expression was significantly decreased in the chemo-hyperthermia group. Vessel density was similar post treatment, but the heated group had reduced vessel area, suggesting thermal enhancement in efficacy by reduction in functional perfusion.

Re-irradiation schedules have been explored in different tumour sites. In this report, we present our preliminary experience of re-irradiation using stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer failure.  Material and methods:   Between March 2011 and October 2014, robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy was administered to patients previously treated with external-beam radiation therapy to a median dose of 71.1Gy (range, 45-76.5Gy) and with biochemical failure corresponding to a local in-field recurrence of prostate cancer. Ten patients had recurrences after postoperative external-beam radiotherapy. Patients underwent a pelvic MRI to confirm the recurrence and a total body staging using a ((18)F)-fluorocholine PET/CT. The prescription dose consisted of five fractions of 7.25Gy to a total dose of 36.25Gy. Efficacy was evaluated based on biochemical response and toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v.4.0 questionnaires and International Prostate Symptom Score.  Results:   Twenty-one patients were treated and followed for a median time of 11.7 months (mean: 13.4 months; range: 2.5-46.5 months). Median time between the first external-beam radiation therapy of prostate cancer and the first day of CyberKnife(®) treatment was 111 months (range: 38-398 months). One-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 83.3%, and only one in-field progression was reported. Two patients had a biochemical failure corresponding to metastatic progression without evidence of local recurrence. Treatment was well tolerated, with only one grade 2 acute genitourinary toxicity, no grade≥2 acute gastrointestinal or late toxicities were reported.  Conclusion:   Stereotactic body re-irradiation therapy using CyberKnife(®) after failed external-beam radiation therapy showed favourable results in terms of in-field local and biochemical control. Toxicity was low and acceptable. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results to select patient and to evaluate the introduction of androgen-deprivation therapy.""","""['G Janoray', 'A Reynaud-Bougnoux', 'A Ruffier-Loubière', 'G Bernadou', 'Y Pointreau', 'G Calais']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Re: Stereotactic Body Re-irradiation Therapy for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After External-beam Radiation Therapy: Initial Report.', 'Salvage prostate re-irradiation using high-dose-rate brachytherapy or focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for local recurrence after definitive radiation therapy.', 'Reirradiation for isolated local recurrence of prostate cancer: Mono-institutional series of 64 patients treated with salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).', 'Robotic Stereotactic Retreatment for Biochemical Control in Previously Irradiated Patients Affected by Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Salvage reirradiation for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

Previous studies have implicated coiled-coil domain-containing protein 8 (CCDC8) as a tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancers. However, the expression levels or functions of CCDC8 in lung cancer have not been elucidated. Here, we used immunohistochemical staining to measure CCDC8 expression in 147 samples from tumors and 30 samples from the adjacent normal lung tissues of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. CCDC8 was shown to be located predominantly in the cytoplasm and partially on the cell membrane, and its expression level was significantly lower in lung cancer samples than that in the adjacent normal lung tissues (P=.001). CCDC8 expression was closely related to tumor differentiation (P=.039), tumor-node-metastasis stage (P=.009), lymph node metastasis (P=.038), and prognosis (P=.043) of lung cancer. Transfection of A549 cells with CCDC8 significantly reduced cell invasion and migration (P<.05), whereas the invasiveness and migration capacity in CCDC8-knockdown A549 cells were significantly increased in comparison with the control cells (P<.05). Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCDC8 can downregulate the expression of Snail and upregulate the expression of E-cadherin by inhibiting p-P38 and p-IκBα. Collectively, CCDC8 may suppress the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells, and it may represent a promising therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer.""","""['Gui-Yang Jiang', 'Xiu-Peng Zhang', 'Yong Zhang', 'Hong-Tao Xu', 'Liang Wang', 'Qing-Chang Li', 'En-Hua Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Long non-coding RNA NKILA inhibits migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer via NF-κB/Snail pathway.', 'Concomitant expression of far upstream element (FUSE) binding protein (FBP) interacting repressor (FIR) and its splice variants induce migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.', 'Overexpression of CASS4 promotes invasion in non-small cell lung cancer by activating the AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting E-cadherin expression.', 'Regulatory network and targeted interventions for CCDC family in tumor pathogenesis.', 'Targeting ion channels for the treatment of lung cancer.', 'CCDC85A is regulated by miR-224-3p and augments cancer cell resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'The lingering effects of Neanderthal introgression on human complex traits.', 'CCDC69 is a prognostic marker of breast cancer and correlates with tumor immune cell infiltration.', 'Construction of circRNA-based ceRNA network and its prognosis-associated subnet of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'G9a Regulates Cell Sensitivity to Radiotherapy via Histone H3 Lysine 9 Trimethylation and CCDC8 in Lung Cancer.']"""

Our aim was to analyze the dynamic modulation, determined by ADT, of the expression of selected genes involved in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer (TMPRSS2:ERG, WNT11, SPINK1, CHGA, AR, and SPDEF) using real-time polymerase chain reaction in a series of 59 surgical samples of prostate carcinomas, including 37 cases preoperatively treated with ADT and 22 untreated cases, and in 43 corresponding biopsies. The same genes were analyzed in androgen-deprived and control LNCaP cells. Three genes were significantly up-modulated (WNT11 and AR) or down-modulated (SPDEF) in patients treated with ADT versus untreated cases, as well as in androgen-deprived LNCaP cells. The effect of ADT on CHGA gene up-modulation was almost exclusively detected in cases positive for the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. The correlation between biopsy and surgical samples was poor for most of the tested genes. Gene expression analysis of separate tumor areas from the same patient showed an extremely heterogeneous profile in the 6 tested cases (all untreated). In conclusion, our results strengthened the implication of ADT in promoting a prostate cancer aggressive phenotype and identified potential biomarkers, with special reference to the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, which might favor the development of neuroendocrine differentiation in hormone-treated patients.

Here, we identified lncRNAs induced by androgen in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, where induction was abolished by AR knockdown as well as an anti-androgen, bicalutamide. By combining these data, we identified an androgen-regulated lncRNA, suppressor of cytokine signaling 2-antisense transcript 1 (SOCS2-AS1), the expression of which was higher in castration-resistant prostate cancer model cells, i.e long-term androgen-deprived (LTAD) cells, than in parental androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. SOCS2-AS1 promoted castration-resistant and androgen-dependent cell growth. We found that SOCS2-AS1 knockdown up-regulated genes related to the apoptosis pathway, including tumor necrosis factor superfamily 10 (TNFSF10), and sensitized prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment.

Here, we reported for the first time the up-regulation of protein S (PROS), an anticoagulant plasma glycoprotein with multiple biological functions, in androgen-insensitive PCa cells and in experimentally induced castration-resistant PCa cells. Overexpression of exogenous PROS in LNCaP cells reduced androgen deprivation-induced apoptosis and enhanced anchorage-dependent clonogenic ability under androgen deprivation condition. Reciprocally, PROS1 knockdown inhibited cell invasiveness and migration, caused the growth inhibition of castration-resistant tumor xenograft under androgen-depleted conditions, and potentiated Taxol (a widely prescribed anti-neoplastic agent)-mediated cell death in PC3 cells. Furthermore, PROS overexpression significantly stimulated AKT activation but failed to evoke oxidative stress in LNCaP cells under normal condition, suggesting that the malignance-promoting effects of the above-mentioned pathway may occur in the order of oxidative stress/PROS/AKT. The potential mechanism may be due to control of oxidative stress-elicited activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Taken together, our gain-of-function, loss-of-function analyses suggest that PROS may facilitate cell proliferation and promote castration resistance in human castration-resistant PCa-like cells via its apoptosis-regulating property.

Cancer (LNCaP) and normal (RWPE-1) prostate epithelial cell lines were treated with pharmacologic concentrations of metformin and simvastatin alone and in combinations. Relative changes in cell number were measured with crystal violet staining method. Drug effects on apoptosis and cell cycle were measured with flow cytometry. We also measured changes in the activation and expression of a set of reported target proteins of metformin and statins with Western blotting. Metformin decreased the relative cell number of LNCaP cells by inducing G1 cell cycle block, autophagy and apoptosis, and slightly increased cytosolic ATP levels, whereas RWPE-1 cells were resistant to metformin. However, RWPE-1 cells were sensitive to simvastatin, which induced G2 cell cycle block, autophagy and apoptosis, and increased cytosolic ATP levels in these cells. Combination of metformin and simvastatin synergistically decreased cytosolic ATP levels, increased autophagy and instead of apoptosis, induced necrosis in LNCaP cells. Synergistic effects were not observed in RWPE-1 cells. These results suggest, that prostate cancer cells may be more vulnerable to combined growth-inhibiting effects of metformin and simvastatin compared to normal cells.

We examined potential impacts and access barriers of this recommendation with consideration of patients who normally do not seek such care.  Methods:   We compared 267 participants of a clinical trial that tested a PFME-based treatment of urinary incontinence and 69 nonparticipants who declined the trial. All subjects were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months on leakage frequency, disease-specific quality of life (QOL), and physical well-being. The nonparticipants were interviewed to examine reasons for intervention refusal.  Results:   The participating and nonparticipating groups did not differ in most baseline demographics and clinical variables except that the nonparticipants had lower baseline prostate-specific antigen (P ≤ 0.01), lower education levels, and higher likelihood of receiving surgery alone (both P ≤ 0.05). Nonparticipants exhibited significantly more frequent daily leakage, poorer urinary function and bother, and severer urinary problems at 3 and 6 months, as well as worse physical well-being at 6 months, relative to baseline, than the participants. The primary reason for refusal was economical, such as lacking transportation and time for participation.  Conclusions:   Urinary function and QOL can worsen without appropriate follow-up care. It is important to make a PFME-based follow-up care program available to all incontinent prostate cancer survivors as recommended by ACS guidelines.

However, how accumulated cholesterol contributes to prostate cancer development and progression is not completely understood. Cholesterol sulfate (CS), the primary sulfonation product of cholesterol sulfotransferase (SULT2B1b), accumulates in human prostate adenocarcinoma and precancerous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions compared with normal regions of the same tissue sample. Given the enhanced accumulation of CS in these lesions, it was hypothesized that SULT2B1b-mediated production of CS provides a growth advantage to these cells. To address this, prostate cancer cells with RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of SULT2B1b were used to assess the impact on cell growth and survival. SULT2B1b is expressed and functional in a variety of prostate cells, and the data demonstrate that SULT2B1b KD, in LNCaP and other androgen-responsive (VCaP and C4-2) cells, results in decreased cell growth/viability and induces cell death. SULT2B1b KD also decreases androgen receptor (AR) activity and expression at mRNA and protein levels. While AR overexpression has no impact on SULT2B1b KD-mediated cell death, the addition of exogenous androgen is able to partially rescue the growth inhibition induced by SULT2B1b KD in LNCaP cells. These results suggest that SULT2B1b positively regulates the AR either through alterations in ligand availability or by interaction with critical coregulators that influence AR activity.  Implications:   These findings provide evidence that SULT2B1b is a novel regulator of AR activity and cell growth in prostate cancer and should be further investigated for therapeutic potential.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the pretreatment albumin/globulin ratio (AGR) and the survival of patients with BUC treated with radical cystectomy (RC).  Materials and methods:   Data from 296 patients with BUC who underwent RC between June 2000 and June 2013 were analyzed. The AGR was calculated as follows: albumin/(total protein-albumin). The AGR was divided into 2 groups for receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used for univariate and multivariate survival analyses.  Results:   Patients in the high AGR group (AGR≥1.60) had a lower 5-year recurrence-free mortality rate compared with those in the low AGR group (AGR<1.60) (87.0% vs. 48.0%, P<0.001). The median cancer-specific survival (CSS) time was 71.1 months for low AGR patients and 156.0 months for the high AGR patients (P<0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, the AGR remained an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard rate = 0.356; 95% CI: 0.170-0.748; P = 0.006) and CSS (hazard rate = 0.280; 95% CI: 0.115-0.683; P = 0.005). Moreover, in the subset of 167 patients with normal serum albumin (albumin of≥40.0g/l), serum AGR continues to be an independent predictor of RFS (P = 0.012) and CSS (P = 0.008).  Conclusions:   High AGR is a strong independent predictor of long-term RFS and CSS in patients with BUC undergoing RC. Additionally, among patients with normal albumin (≥40g/l) levels, patients with higher globulin, but lower AGR have worse survival. The pretreatment AGR is an easily accessible and cheap to use for predicting mortality in patients with BUC treated by RC.""","""['Jianye Liu', 'Yingbo Dai', 'Fangjian Zhou', 'Zhi Long', 'Yonghong Li', 'Bin Liu', 'Dan Xie', 'Jin Tang', 'Jing Tan', 'Kun Yao', 'Yichuan Zhang', 'Yuxin Tang', 'Leye He']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Decrease of Preoperative Serum Albumin-to-Globulin Ratio as a Prognostic Indicator after Radical Cystectomy in Patients with Urothelial Bladder Cancer.', 'The prognostic value of preoperative serum albumin-globulin ratio for high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma treated with radical cystectomy: A propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Prognostic Impact of Preoperative Albumin-Globulin Ratio on Oncologic Outcomes in Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Treated With Radical Nephroureterectomy.', 'Impact of preoperative serum albumin-globulin ratio on disease outcome after radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Pretreatment albumin to globulin ratio can serve as a prognostic marker in human cancers: a meta-analysis.', 'Predictive value of nutritional indicators with regard to the survival outcomes in patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with camrelizumab.', 'Utilizing the Lactate Dehydrogenase-to-Albumin Ratio for Survival Prediction in Patients with Bladder Cancer After Radical Cystectomy.', 'Blood-Based Biomarkers as Prognostic Factors of Recurrent Disease after Radical Cystectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prognostic significance of the preoperative alkaline phosphatase‑to‑albumin ratio in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection.', 'Serum albumin to globulin ratio prior to treatment as a potential non-invasive prognostic indicator for urological cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men enrolled in an active surveillance program at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 1998 and 2014 were identified through a prospectively maintained database. All patients were assessed for entry eligibility into the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance, Johns Hopkins, University of Miami, University of California San Francisco, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Toronto-Sunnybrook and Royal Marsden protocols. The 2-sided t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon rank sum or chi-square tests were used for comparison as appropriate.  Results:   Of the 1,365 men identified 1,085 met the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre inclusion criteria. When the Johns Hopkins, Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance and University of Miami criteria were applied 15.2%, 11.5% and 11.3% of these patients were excluded from active surveillance, respectively. No significant differences were noted between men who met the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre criteria and those who were excluded based on more stringent criteria when grade or volume reclassification was compared. No significant differences in prostate specific antigen velocity or the number of patients who proceeded to seek treatment were noted (p >0.1). Rates of biochemical recurrence among patients who chose to undergo radical prostatectomy after initial active surveillance were not different between men who met the more inclusive vs more exclusive active surveillance protocols.

A shared decision making process incorporating patient values and preferences is paramount. We evaluated the benefit of a novel decision making application, and investigated associations between patient preferences and treatment choice.  Materials and methods:   We used a novel, web based application that provides education, preference measurement and personalized decision analysis for patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Preferences are measured using conjoint analysis. The application ranks treatment options according to their ""fit"" (expected value) based on clinical factors and personal preferences, and serves as the basis for shared decision making during the consultation. We administered the decisional conflict scale before and after completion of the application. Additionally, we compared post-visit perceptions of shared decision making between a baseline ""usual care"" cohort and a cohort seen after the application was integrated into clinical practice.  Results:   A total of 109 men completed the application before their consultation, and had decisional conflict measured before and after use. Overall decisional conflict decreased by 37% (p <0.0001). Analysis of the decisional conflict subscales revealed statistically significant improvements in all 5 domains. Patients completing the decision making application (33) felt more included in (88% vs 57%, p=0.01) and jointly responsible for (94% vs 52%, p <0.0001) the decision about further treatment compared to those receiving usual care (24).

However, it remains unclear whether African-American race is independently associated with adverse outcomes in men with clinical low risk disease.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 895 men in the SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database in whom clinical low risk prostate cancer was treated with radical prostatectomy. Associations of African-American and Caucasian race with pathological biochemical recurrence outcomes were examined using chi-square, logistic regression, log rank and Cox proportional hazards analyses.  Results:   We identified 355 African-American and 540 Caucasian men with low risk tumors in the SEARCH cohort who were followed a median of 6.3 years. Following adjustment for relevant covariates African-American race was not significantly associated with pathological upgrading (OR 1.33, p = 0.12), major upgrading (OR 0.58, p = 0.10), up-staging (OR 1.09, p = 0.73) or positive surgical margins (OR 1.04, p = 0.81). Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 73.4% in African-American men and 78.4% in Caucasian men (log rank p = 0.18). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis model African-American race was not significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (HR 1.11, p = 0.52).  Conclusions:   In a cohort of patients at clinical low risk who were treated with prostatectomy in an equal access health system with a high representation of African-American men we observed no significant differences in the rates of pathological upgrading, up-staging or biochemical recurrence. These data support continued use of active surveillance in African-American men.

The solution for society requires an economically viable treatment strategy to maintain individuals disease free and productive, so as to avoid the fracture of the family unit. Forty years ago, translational research using the antiestrogen tamoxifen was targeted to estrogen receptor (ER) positive micrometastatic tumor cells and established the long-term antihormone adjuvant treatment strategy used universally today. The antihormone strategy was the accepted structure of cancer biology. Sex steroid deprivation therapy remains the orthodox strategy for the treatment of both breast and prostate cancer. Despite major initial therapeutic success, the strategies of long term anti-hormone therapies with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI) or antiandrogens or abiraterone for breast and prostate cancer, respectively, eventually lead to a significant proportion of anti-hormone resistant or stimulated tumor growth. Remarkably, a general principle of anti-hormone resistance has emerged for both breast and prostate cancer based primarily on clinical and supportive laboratory data. Paradoxically, anti-hormone resistant cell populations emerge and grow but are vulnerable to the cytotoxicity of estrogen or androgen-induced apoptosis for both breast and prostate cancer, respectively. These consistent anticancer actions of sex steroids appear to recapitulate the more complex mechanism of bone remodeling in elderly men and women during sex steroid deprivation. Estrogen is the key hormone in both sexes because in men androgen is first converted to estrogen. Estrogen regulates and triggers apoptosis in osteoclasts that develop during estrogen deprivation and destroy bone to cause osteoporosis. Sex steroid deprived breast and prostate cancer has recruited a streamlined natural apoptotic program from the human genome, but this is suppressed in the majority of sex steroid deprived tumors. Targeted strategies to neutralize cell survival pathways are now required to amplify and enhance sex steroid induced apoptosis. Successful blockade of the critical pathways for cell survival will introduce an inexpensive targeted therapy to maintain breast and prostate cancer patients indefinitely. Rotating anti-hormonal and sex steroid targeted cocktails could maintain patients at a microscopic tumor burden to enhance the quality of life, enhance survival, and maintain the family as a self-supporting and economically productive unit within society.""","""['V Craig Jordan', 'Ping Fan', 'Balkees Abderrahman', 'Philipp Y Maximov', 'Yousef M Hawsawi', 'Poulomi Bhattacharya', 'Niranjana Pokharel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Discov Med""","""['A unifying biology of sex steroid-induced apoptosis in prostate and breast cancers.', 'Estrogen-mediated mechanisms to control the growth and apoptosis of breast cancer cells: a translational research success story.', 'Opportunities and challenges of long term anti-estrogenic adjuvant therapy: treatment forever or intermittently?', 'The St. Gallen Prize Lecture 2011: evolution of long-term adjuvant anti-hormone therapy: consequences and opportunities.', 'Strategy of drug development for hormone-dependent tumor.', 'Rosetta Stone for Cancer Cure: Comparison of the Anticancer Capacity of Endogenous Estrogens, Synthetic Estrogens and Antiestrogens.', 'BARD1 mystery: tumor suppressors are cancer susceptibility genes.', 'Estrogen Receptor and the Unfolded Protein Response: Double-Edged Swords in Therapy for Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.', 'Association of SNPs within TMPRSS6 and BMP2 genes with iron deficiency status in Saudi Arabia.', 'Prostate cancer and therapeutic challenges.']"""

The average population per year of Lahore was estimated at 9.8 million in 2010-2012.  Design:   A cross-sectional study.  Setting:   The Registry has 19 collaborating centres in Lahore that report their data to the Central Office located within a tertiary care cancer treatment facility in Lahore, Pakistan.  Participants:   Patients belonging to Lahore, of any age-group, and diagnosed with cancer in 2010-2012, were included in the study. They were followed up between July and October 2015 to determine their vital status.  Outcome measures:   Summaries were generated for gender, the basis of diagnosis, diagnoses and deaths. The Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR) were computed per 100 000 population, by gender and cancer site. Five-year age categories were created from 0-4 until 70-74, followed by 75+ years. Death counts were reported by site.  Results:   Between 2010 and 2012, in Lahore, a total of 15 840 new cancers were diagnosed in 43% male patients and 57% female patients; 93.5% were microscopically confirmed and 6.5% non-microscopically. In females, the ASIR was 105.1 and in males, it was 66.7. ASIRs of leading cancers among women were breast 47.6, ovary 4.9 and corpus uteri 3.6, whereas among men they were prostate 6.4, bladder 5.0, and trachea, bronchus and lung 4.6. A total of 5134 deaths were recorded.  Conclusions:   In Lahore, the ASIR was higher in women than in men. Among women and men, breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively, were the leading cancer types.

Mean survival time is rarely reported due to censoring imposed by limited follow-up time, whereas the median survival time often is. The empirical relationship between mean and median survival time for cancer patients is not known.  Aim:   To derive the empirical associations between mean and median survival time across cancer types and to validate this empirical prediction approach and compare it with the standard approach of fitting a Weibull distribution.  Methods:   We included all patients in Norway diagnosed from 1960 to 1999 with one of the 13 most common solid tumor cancers until emigration, death, or 31 December 2011, whichever came first. Observed median, restricted mean, and mean survival times were obtained in subcohorts defined by patients' sex, age, cancer type, and time period of diagnosis, which had nearly complete follow-up. Based on theoretical considerations, we fitted a linear relationship between observed means and medians on the log scale. For validation, we estimated mean survival from medians of bootstrap samples with artificially induced censoring and compared with fitting a Weibull distribution.  Results:   A linear relationship between log-mean survival time and log-median survival time was identified for the 6 cancers with shortest survival plus metastasized breast and prostate cancers. The predicted means of the empirical approach had smaller bias than the standard Weibull approach.  Conclusion:   For cancer diagnoses with poor prognosis, mean survival times could be predicted from corresponding medians. This empirical prediction approach is useful for validation of estimates of mean survival time and sensitivity analyses in settings with aggregated data only.""","""['Mette L Lousdal', 'Ivar Sønbø Kristiansen', 'Bjørn Møller', 'Henrik Støvring']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Predicting Difference in Mean Survival Time from Reported Hazard Ratios for Cancer Patients.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Extrapolation of Survival Curves Using Standard Parametric Models and Flexible Parametric Spline Models: Comparisons in Large Registry Cohorts with Advanced Cancer.', ""Period analysis for 'up-to-date' cancer survival data: theory, empirical evaluation, computational realisation and applications."", 'Intersections of mortality-rate and survival functions: model-independent considerations.', 'Can Elderly Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Gain Survival Advantages Through More Radical Surgeries?

The aim of this study was to show that a combination of tissue-clearing protocols and confocal microscopy can successfully be applied to investigate the 3D architecture of human prostate tissue.  Methods and results:   Optical clearing of intact fresh and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical prostate specimens allowed us to visualize tissue structures up to a depth of 800 μm, whereas, in uncleared tissue, detection of fluorescence was only possible up to 70 μm. Fluorescent labelling with a general nuclear dye and antibodies against cytokeratin (CK) 5 and CK8-18 resulted in comprehensive 3D imaging of benign peripheral and transition prostate zones, as well as individual PCa growth patterns. After staining, clearing, and imaging, samples could still be processed for 2D (immuno)histochemical staining and DNA analysis, enabling additional molecular and diagnostic characterization of small tissue specimens.

Methods:   Using SEER-Medicare-linked data, the authors identified a cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer with indications for RT due to adverse pathologic risk factors. Receipt of RT was compared between the SEER database and Medicare claims, with the latter considered to be the ""gold standard."" Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with ascertainment of RT in SEER.  Results:   A total of 3842 men were analyzed, 749 of whom were found to have Medicare claims for RT within 1 year of undergoing prostatectomy. SEER ascertainment of postprostatectomy RT was 56% overall: 76% among patients who received RT within 2 months of prostatectomy, 73% among patients who received RT between 2 to 4 months after prostatectomy, 63% among patients who received RT between 4 to 6 months after prostatectomy, 44% among patients who received RT between 6 to 8 months after prostatectomy, and 21% among patients who received RT between 8 to 12 months after prostatectomy. On multivariable analysis, increasing time from prostatectomy to RT was found to be significantly associated with decreased SEER ascertainment (odds ratio, 0.70 per month; P<.001). There also was variation noted by SEER region and urban/rural locale.  Conclusions:   SEER underascertains the receipt of postprostatectomy RT compared with Medicare claims, and the magnitude of the underascertainment increases with longer time between prostatectomy and RT.

There were no indications of additive effects on steroid secretion from the combined treatment with equimolar concentrations of the three ARs. Gene expressions of CYP21A2, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 were downregulated and CYP11A1 was upregulated by the ARs. The results on gene expression could not explain the effects on steroidogenesis, which may be due to direct effects on enzyme activities, such as inhibition of CYP17A1.

Two biologically-derived matrices, Matrigel and Cultrex BME, and one synthetic matrix, the Alvetex scaffold, were used to culture the cells. The cell proliferation rate, cellular response to anti-cancer drugs, and expression levels of proteins associated with drug sensitivity/resistance were examined and compared amongst the 3D-cultured cells on the three matrices and 2D-cultured cells. The cellular responses upon treatment with two common anti-cancer drugs, Docetaxel and Rapamycin, were examined. The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and β-III tubulin in DU145 cells and p53 in LNCaP cells were examined. The results showed that the proliferation rates of cells cultured on the three matrices varied, especially between the synthetic matrix and the biologically-derived matrices. The drug responses and the expressions of drug sensitivity-associated proteins differed between cells on various matrices as well. Among the 3D cultures on the three matrices, increased expression of β-III tubulin in DU145 cells was correlated with increased resistance to Docetaxel, and decreased expression of EGFR in DU145 cells was correlated with increased sensitivity to Rapamycin. Increased expression of a p53 dimer in 3D-cultured LNCaP cells was correlated with increased resistance to Docetaxel.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-one patients with prostate cancer who underwent preoperative 3-T MRI and prostatectomy were included in this study. Patients underwent a hybrid T2-weighted imaging-DWI examination consisting of DW images acquired with TEs of 47, 75, and 100 ms and b values of 0 and 750 s/mm(2). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 were calculated for cancer and normal prostate ROIs at each TE and b value. Changes in ADC and T2 as a function of increasing the TE and b value, respectively, were analyzed. A new metric termed ""PQ4"" was defined as the percentage of voxels within an ROI that has increasing T2 with increasing b value and has decreasing ADC with increasing TE.  Results:   ADC values were significantly higher in normal ROIs than in cancer ROIs at all TEs (p < 0.0001). With increasing TE, the mean ADC increased 3% in cancer ROIs and increased 12% in normal ROIs. T2 was significantly higher in normal ROIs than in cancer ROIs at both b values (p ≤ 0.0002). The mean T2 decreased with increasing b value in cancer ROIs (ΔT2 = -17 ms) and normal ROIs (ΔT2 = -52 ms). PQ4 clearly differentiated normal ROIs from prostate cancer ROIs (p = 0.0004) and showed significant correlation with Gleason score (ρ = 0.508, p < 0.0001).

This study investigated its anti-cancer activity in prostate cancer cells and the mechanisms involved.  Methods:   Two human prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and Du145, were treated with norcantharidin at concentrations ranging from 3 to 30μg/ml. Cytotoxic effect of norcantharidin was determined by use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. The effects of apoptosis were evaluated by cell death assay, Caspase-3, -8, -9 activity and cytochrome c release. The apoptotic related protein expressions (Bcl-2 family and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) were determined using western blotting.  Results:   An MTT assay revealed that norcantharidin induced cytotoxicity against both prostate cancer cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Treatment with norcantharidin at 3μg/ml or higher significantly increased oligonucleosomal formation with concomitant appearance of PARP cleavage, implicating the induction of apoptosis. Norcantharidin intrinsically elevated cytosolic cytochrome c levels and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9. Extrinsically, it upregulated the expression of not only the death receptors Fas and DR5 in 22Rv1 cells, but also of RIP and TRADD adaptor proteins in Du145 cells. Mechanistically, norcantharidin increased ratios of pro-/anti-apoptotic proteins and decreased expression of IAP family member proteins, including cIAP1 and survivin, regardless of the distinct status of androgen receptor expression in both cells.

We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between midlife alcohol intake and drinking patterns with future prostate cancer risk and mortality in a population-based cohort of Finnish twins.  Methods:   Data were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,372 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Alcohol consumption was assessed by questionnaires administered at two time points over follow-up. Over the study period, 601 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between weekly alcohol intake and binge drinking patterns with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were performed to control for potential confounding by shared genetic and early environmental factors.  Results:   Compared to light drinkers (≤3 drinks/week; non-abstainers), heavy drinkers (>14 drinks/week) were at a 1.46-fold higher risk (HR 1.46; 95 % CI 1.12, 1.91) of prostate cancer, adjusting for important confounders. Among current drinkers, binge drinkers were at a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.28; 95 % CI 1.06, 1.55) compared to non-binge drinkers. Abstainers were at a 1.90-fold higher risk (HR 1.90; 95 % CI 1.04, 3.47) of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light drinkers, but no other significant associations for mortality were found. Co-twin analyses suggested that alcohol consumption may be associated with prostate cancer risk independent of early environmental and genetic factors.  Conclusion:   Heavy regular alcohol consumption and binge drinking patterns may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk, while abstinence may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light alcohol consumption.""","""['Barbra A Dickerman', 'Sarah Coseo Markt', 'Markku Koskenvuo', 'Eero Pukkala', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Jaakko Kaprio']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Sleep disruption, chronotype, shift work, and prostate cancer risk and mortality: a 30-year prospective cohort study of Finnish twins.', 'Increased stroke risk is related to a binge-drinking habit.', 'Relationship of Alcohol Consumption to All-Cause, Cardiovascular, and Cancer-Related Mortality in U.S. Adults.', 'Is alcohol consumption a risk factor for prostate cancer?

Materials and methods:   Among 50 patients who underwent RRP for prostate cancer, 40 who did not undergo additional treatment that might affect their urination pattern were included in the analysis. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) score, and uroflowmetry were analyzed prior to RRP and 12 months after RRP. Twelve months after RRP, patients desiring improvement of storage symptoms were administered anticholinergic drugs for 6 months; the effects of such treatments were analyzed 3 and 6 months later.  Results:   Preoperatively and at 12 months after surgery, the mean IPSS for patients were 10.9 &plusmn; 6.7 and 9.2 &plusmn; 5.7, respectively. The mean IPSS for patients desiring improvement of storage symptoms before and after administration of medication were 9.7 &plusmn; 5.9 and 9.0 &plusmn; 4.4, respectively. In particular, the mean storage symptom composites improved significantly after administration of medication. There were no statistically significant differences in frequency between baseline and 3-month, but frequency was improved significantly after 6 months. Urgency and nocturia were improved significantly after 3 months.  Conclusion:   In patients undergoing RRP, urinary symptoms change over time, with worsening storage symptoms.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between BR and overall mortality (OAM) in high-risk prostate cancer patients who were treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and had long-term follow-up in 2 prospective trials.  Methods:   In the 2 phase 2 clinical trials, which involved 466 prostate cancer patients who received 63.0 to 66.0 Gy of CIRT (relative biological effect) in 20 fractions between 2000 and 2007, 324 patients who were deemed to be at high risk on the basis of the modified D'Amico classification criteria and received CIRT along with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were examined. The OAM rate was adjusted for the ADT duration, and multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model were performed for OAM with BR as a time-dependent covariate.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 107.4 months, and the 5- and 10-year OAM rates after adjustments for the ADT duration were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0%-9.4%) and 23.9% (95% CI, 16.4%-26.2%), respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of BR (hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% Cl, 1.57-5.08; P = .001) was one of the predictive factors for OAM. On the other hand, the duration of ADT had no impact on OAM.  Conclusions:   BR after CIRT combined with ADT is an independent predictive factor for OAM in high-risk prostate cancer patients. The results of this study could be applied to other high-dose radiation therapies. Cancer 2016;122:3225-31. © 2016 The Authors.

We directly tested this relationship by assessing tumorigenicity of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of moderate-grade localized prostate cancer in lean and obese severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Mice were rendered obese and insulin resistant by high-fat feeding for 6 weeks prior to transplantation, and PDXs were assessed 10 weeks thereafter. Histological analysis of PDX grafts showed no differences in tumor pathology, prostate-specific antigen, androgen receptor and homeobox protein Nkx-3.1 expression, or proliferation index in lean versus obese mice. Whilst systemic obesity per se did not promote prostate tumorigenicity, we next asked whether the peri-prostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), which covers the prostate anteriorly, plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis. In vitro studies in a cellularized co-culture model of stromal and epithelial cells demonstrated that factors secreted from human PPAT are pro-tumorigenic. Accordingly, we recapitulated the prostate-PPAT spatial relationship by co-grafting human PPAT with prostate cancer in PDX grafts. PDX tissues were harvested 10 weeks after grafting, and histological analysis revealed no evidence of enhanced tumorigenesis with PPAT compared to prostate cancer grafts alone. Altogether, these data demonstrate that prostate cancer tumorigenicity is not accelerated in the setting of diet-induced obesity or in the presence of human PPAT, prompting the need for further work to define the at-risk populations of obesity-driven tumorigenesis and the biological factors linking obesity, adipose tissue and prostate cancer pathogenesis.""","""['Jennifer C Y Lo', 'Ashlee K Clark', 'Natasha Ascui', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Matthew J Watt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Periprostatic Adipose Tissue Favors Prostate Cancer Cell Invasion in an Obesity-Dependent Manner: Role of Oxidative Stress.', 'Movember GAP1 PDX project: An international collection of serially transplantable prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.', 'Peri-prostatic adipose tissue: the metabolic microenvironment of prostate cancer.', 'Establishment of primary patient-derived xenografts of palliative TURP specimens to study castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Periprostatic Adipose Tissue Microenvironment: Metabolic and Hormonal Pathways During Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Role of CD36 in cancer progression, stemness, and targeting.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment: Carcinogenesis, cancer drug resistance, and therapeutic potential.', 'The role of obesity and bariatric surgery-induced weight loss in breast cancer.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?']"""

Previous studies of blood-measured Alu/LINE-1 and cancer risk are inconsistent.  Methods:   We studied 1259 prospective methylation measurements from blood drawn 1-4 times from 583 participants from 1999 to 2012. We used Cox regression to evaluate time-dependent methylation as a biomarker for cancer risk and mortality, and linear regression to compare mean differences in methylation over time by cancer status and analyse associations between rate of methylation change and cancer.  Results:   Time-dependent LINE-1 methylation was associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.01-1.88) and all-cancer mortality (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92). The first measurement of Alu methylation (HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08-1.79) was associated with all-cancer mortality. Participants who ultimately developed cancer had lower mean LINE-1 methylation than cancer-free participants 10+ years pre-diagnosis (P<0.01). Rate of Alu methylation change was associated with all-cancer incidence (HR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.09-12.10).

Methods:   Patients with severe hemorrhagic CRP who were admitted from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled into this study. All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up.  Results:   Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group. Pathological evaluation after colostomy found diffused chronic inflammation cells, and massive fibrosis collagen depositions under the rectal wall, which revealed potential fibrosis formation.  Conclusion:   Diverting colostomy is a simple, effective and safe procedure for severe hemorrhagic CRP.

We combine targeted proteomics with computational biology to discover robust proteomic signatures for prostate cancer. Quantitative proteomics conducted in expressed prostatic secretions from men with extraprostatic and organ-confined prostate cancers identified 133 differentially expressed proteins. Using synthetic peptides, we evaluate them by targeted proteomics in a 74-patient cohort of expressed prostatic secretions in urine.

Lung, breast and prostate carcinoma are the most common causes of pain from osseous metastasis. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is one of the subtypes of ATP-gated purinergic ion channel family, predominately distributed in microglia in the spinal cord. Activation of P2X7Rs in the spinal dorsal horn has been associated with release of proinflammatory cytokines from glial cells, causing increased neuronal excitability and exaggerated nociception. Mounting evidence implies a critical role of P2X7R in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, whether P2X7R is involved in cancer pain remains controversial. Here we established a bone cancer pain model by injecting the Lewis lung carcinoma cells into the femur bone marrow cavity of C57BL/6J wild-type mice (C57 WT mice) and P2X7R knockout mice (P2rx7(-/-) mice) to explore the role of P2X7R in bone cancer pain. Following intrafemur carcinoma inoculation, robust mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in C57 WT mice were developed on day 7 and 14, respectively, and persisted for at least 28 days in the ipsilateral hindpaw of the affected limb. CatWalk gait analysis showed significant decreases in the print area and stand phase, and a significant increase in swing phase in the ipsilateral hindpaw on day 21 and 28 after carcinoma cells inoculation. Histopathological sections (hematoxylin and eosin stain) showed that the bone marrow of the affected femur was largely replaced by invading tumor cells, and the femur displayed medullary bone loss and bone destruction on day 28 after inoculation. Unexpectedly, no significant changes in bone cancer-induced hypersensitivity of pain behaviors were found in P2rx7(-/-) mice, and the changes of pain-related values in CatWalk gait analysis even occurred earlier in P2rx7(-/-) mice, as compared with C57 WT mice. Together with our previous study in rats that blockade of P2X7R significantly alleviated bone cancer pain, it is implied that P2X7R may play different roles in bone cancer pain in different species (e.g. rat vs mouse). These results implicated a huge difference between the pathophysiology discovered in the experimental animal models and that of human disease.""","""['Xin Zhao', 'Hui-Zhu Liu', 'Yu-Qiu Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sheng Li Xue Bao""","""['Involvement of RVM-expressed P2X7 receptor in bone cancer pain: mechanism of descending facilitation.', 'The role of glutamate release mediated by extrasynaptic P2X7 receptors in animal models of neuropathic pain.', 'P2X7 receptor-mediated analgesia in cancer-induced bone pain.', 'P2X7 receptors: channels, pores and more.', 'P2X7 receptors: role in bone cell formation and function.', 'The emerging power and promise of non-coding RNAs in chronic pain.', 'Emerging roles of the P2X7 receptor in cancer pain.']"""

Current guidelines for prostate MRI reporting concentrate on prostate cancer (PCa) detection and staging. A standardised approach to prostate MRI reporting for active surveillance will facilitate the robust collection of evidence in this newly developing area.  Objective:   To develop preliminary recommendations for reporting of individual MRI studies in men on active surveillance and for researchers reporting the outcomes of cohorts of men having MRI on active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used. Experts in urology, radiology, and radiation oncology developed a set of 394 statements relevant to prostate MRI reporting in men on active surveillance for PCa. Each statement was scored for agreement on a 9-point scale by each panellist prior to a panel meeting. Each statement was discussed and rescored at the meeting.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Measures of agreement and consensus were calculated for each statement. The most important statements, derived from both group discussion and scores of agreement and consensus, were used to create the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) checklist and case report form.  Results and limitations:   Key recommendations include reporting the index lesion size using absolute values at baseline and at each subsequent MRI. Radiologists should assess the likelihood of true change over time (ie, change in size or change in lesion characteristics on one or more sequences) on a 1-5 scale. A checklist of items for reporting a cohort of men on active surveillance was developed. These items were developed based on expert consensus in many areas in which data are lacking, and they are expected to develop and change as evidence is accrued.  Conclusions:   The PRECISE recommendations are designed to facilitate the development of a robust evidence database for documenting changes in prostate MRI findings over time of men on active surveillance. If used, they will facilitate data collection to distinguish measurement error and natural variability in MRI appearances from true radiologic progression.  Patient summary:   Few published reports are available on how to use and interpret magnetic resonance imaging for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. The PRECISE panel recommends that data should be collected in a standardised manner so that natural variation in the appearance and measurement of cancer over time can be distinguished from changes indicating significant tumour progression.""","""['Caroline M Moore', 'Francesco Giganti', 'Peter Albertsen', 'Clare Allen', 'Chris Bangma', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Peter Carroll', 'Masoom Haider', 'Veeru Kasivisvanathan', 'Alex Kirkham', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Adil Ouzzane', 'Anwar R Padhani', 'Valeria Panebianco', 'Peter Pinto', 'Philippe Puech', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Raphaele Renard-Penna', 'Karim Touijer', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Heinrik van Poppel', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Jochen Walz', 'Ivo Schoots']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Sequential prostate MRI reporting in men on active surveillance: initial experience of a dedicated PRECISE software program.', 'Standards of reporting for MRI-targeted biopsy studies (START) of the prostate: recommendations from an International Working Group.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for the detection, localisation, and characterisation of prostate cancer: recommendations from a European consensus meeting.', 'Best Current Practice and Research Priorities in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-A Report of a Movember International Consensus Meeting.', ""ESUR/ESUI consensus statements on multi-parametric MRI for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: quality requirements for image acquisition, interpretation and radiologists' training."", 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Stability of Multi-Parametric Prostate MRI Radiomic Features to Variations in Segmentation.', 'Using a Recurrent Neural Network To Inform the Use of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and PSA Density for Dynamic Monitoring of the Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression on Active Surveillance.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'PI-RADS: Where Next?']"""

Methods:   This study included 569 Chinese men with PSA 4-10 ng/mL and non-suspicious DRE with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) 10-core prostate biopsies performed between April 2008 and July 2015. DRE-PV was estimated using 3 pre-defined classes: 25, 40, or 60 ml. The performance of PSA-based and PHI-based predictive models including age, DRE-PV, and TRUS prostate volume (TRUS-PV) was analyzed using logistic regression and area under the receiver operating curves (AUC), in both the whole cohort and the screening age group of 55-75.  Results:   PCa and high-grade PCa (HGPCa) was diagnosed in 10.9 % (62/569) and 2.8 % (16/569) men, respectively. The performance of DRE-PV-based models was similar to TRUS-PV-based models. In the age group 55-75, the AUCs for PCa of PSA alone, PSA with DRE-PV and age, PHI alone, PHI with DRE-PV and age, and PHI with TRUS-PV and age were 0.54, 0.71, 0.76, 0.78, and 0.78, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for HGPCa were higher (0.60, 0.70, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.83). At 10 and 20 % risk threshold for PCa, 38.4 and 55.4 % biopsies could be avoided in the PHI-based model, respectively.

Methods:   Participants were drawn from a randomly selected, community-dwelling cohort of men in Adelaide, Australia. Seven hundred and eight men (mean: 60.7 [41.6-88.2] years) who had polysomnography recordings, complete lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) measures (International Prostate Symptom Score), without prostate or bladder cancer and/or surgery, and no prior OSA diagnosis were selected. Nocturia was defined as ≥2 voids per main sleep. Unadjusted and multi-adjusted regression models of nocturia were combined with OSA, wake after sleep onset, total sleep period, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and sleep quality (SQ) data, together with socio-demographic, and health-related factors.  Results:   Men with nocturia were found to have higher levels of OSA (32.2% [n = 65]), wake after sleep onset time (97.2 ± 52.9 minutes), sleep period (467.3 ± 58.4 minutes), EDS (18.2% [n = 37]), and poorer SQ (54.3% [n = 108]). Multiple-adjusted models showed nocturia was positively associated with OSA (odds ratio:1.64, 95% confidence interval [1.03,2.55]), EDS (1.72 [1.01,2.93]), and poorer SQ (1.65 [1.10,2.48]). Including other storage and voiding LUTS attenuated the effect of OSA and strengthened the association with EDS (2.44 [1.45,4.10] and 2.24 [1.19,4.22]), whereas voiding LUTS also strengthened the association with poorer SQ (2.61 [1.63,4.17]). Men with increasing nocturic frequency spent less time in N2 and rapid eye movement stage sleep.  Conclusion:   Nocturia is strongly associated with OSA in community-based men. Nocturia also reduces sleep efficiency/SQ, N2, and rapid eye movement sleep time, while increasing EDS. Other LUTS increase EDS through non-OSA means.""","""['Sean A Martin', 'Sarah L Appleton', 'Robert J Adams', 'Anne W Taylor', 'Peter G Catcheside', 'Andrew Vakulin', 'R Douglas McEvoy', 'Nick A Antic', 'Gary A Wittert']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Associations of Undiagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness With Depression: An Australian Population Study.', 'Association of daytime sleepiness with obstructive sleep apnoea and comorbidities varies by sleepiness definition in a population cohort of men.', 'Uncovering the sleep disorders among young doctors.', 'Medical Treatment of Nocturia in Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Systematic Review by the European Association of Urology Guidelines Panel for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and nocturia: a meta-analysis.', 'Association between Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Sleep Quality of Patients with Depression.', 'Polysomnography and Nocturia Evaluations after Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.', 'Effects of biofeedback-based sleep improvement program on urinary symptoms and sleep patterns of elderly Korean women with overactive bladder syndrome.', 'Factors involved in sleep efficiency: a population-based study of community-dwelling elderly persons.', 'Sleep, Sleep Disorders, and Sexual Dysfunction.']"""

However, the prognostic significance of NLR was never previously evaluated in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the influence of NLR on survival after a RP for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 2301 patients with prostate cancer who underwent RP at our institution between 2000 and 2010. Among these patients, we considered only patients who had a preoperative complete blood count with differential result available. Patients who received neoadjuvant or postoperative adjuvant treatment (radiation, androgen deprivation therapy or both) and those without adequate medical record were excluded. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used for each end point.  Results:   In total, 2067 patients were evaluated; median follow-up time was 78 months (interquartile range (IQR) 65-96), median age at RP was 66 years (IQR 61-70) and median preoperative NLR was 1.76 (IQR 1.35-2.40). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association between high NLR (⩾1.76) and decreased CSS (P=0.005) and OS (P=0.003) but not with BCRFS (P=0.223). In the univariate and multivariate regression analyses, a high NLR was a significant predictor of CSS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.012, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.222-3.310, P=0.006) and OS (HR 1.650, 95% CI 1.127-2.416, P=0.010).

LSD1 is a coregulator of ligand-independent androgen receptor signaling promoting c-MYC expression. We examined the antitumor efficacy of LSD1 inhibition with HCI-2509 in advanced stages of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Cell survival, colony formation, histone methylation, c-MYC level, c-MYC expression, cell cycle changes and in vivo efficacy were studied in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells upon treatment with HCI-2509. In vitro combination studies, using HCI-2509 and docetaxel, were performed to assess the synergy. Cell survival, colony formation, histone methylation and c-myc levels were studied in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells treated with HCI-2509.  Results:   HCI-2509 is cytotoxic and inhibits colony formation in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. HCI-2509 treatment causes a dose-dependent increase in H3K9me2 (histone H3lysine 9) levels, a decrease in c-MYC protein, inhibition of c-MYC expression and accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in these cells. PC3 xenografts in mice have a significant reduction in tumor burden upon treatment with HCI-2509 with no associated myelotoxicity or weight loss. More synergy is noted at sub-IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) doses of docetaxel and HCI-2509 in PC3 cells than in DU145 cells. HCI-2509 has growth-inhibitory efficacy and decreases the c-myc level in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.

The present study examines this relationship among men initially diagnosed with low- to intermediate-risk PCa and managed with active surveillance (AS).  Methods:   Men enrolled in two separate AS programs were recruited for this study. Data regarding clinical, demographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected. Results were then compared between men whose disease remained low- to intermediate-risk and men whose disease progressed.  Results:   Demographic, clinical and physical characteristics were similar between comparative groups and cohorts, with the exception that age at the time of diagnosis and questionnaire was increased among men whose disease progressed. Lifestyle scores among men who remained low- to intermediate-risk were higher than those whose risk progressed; however, scores were only significant in one cohort on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, the only predictor of progression was age at diagnosis. Physical activity was consistently higher in both low risk groups, although this difference was insignificant. Consistent differences in other lifestyle variables were not observed.  Conclusions:   Age remains an important predictor of PCa progression. Improving lifestyle characteristics among men initially managed with AS might help to reduce the risk of progression.

We developed two hierarchical regression models with fixed effect accounting for hospital clustering and physician clustering to determine factors associated with utilization of RARP versus ORP at hospitals offering robotic surgery.  Results:   A total of 36,694 patients were identified, with 77.13% receiving RARP and 22.87% receiving ORP. African American patients had lower RARP rates than White patients (OR = 0.80, p < 0.001).

Materials and methods:   A total of 39 patients underwent salvage radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (20 robotic, 19 open) for local recurrence following radiation therapy at a single institution between 2007 and 2011. Intraoperative parameters, postoperative complications, and oncological outcomes, were recorded. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparison of continuous and categorical variables respectively. Mean values of numeric variables are reported with standard deviation.  Results:   The cohorts were similar with respect to age, ethnicity, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Score classification. Estimated blood loss was lower in the robotic group versus the open group (381.3 mL versus 865.0 mL, p = 0.001). There was no difference in the rate of intraoperative complications, postoperative Clavien = 3 complications (30% versus 15.7%), anastomotic leak (40% versus 42.1%), or wound infection (0% versus 15.7%) in the robotic and open groups.

Methods:   A nationwide survey of Australia-based urologist members of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.  Results:   Ninety-six respondents completed the 2015 survey (30% response rate) compared with 157 (45% response rate) in 2012. There was no significant change in awareness of national clinical practice guidelines for the management of prostate cancer. When considering adjuvant against salvage radiotherapy, urologists were significantly less favourable towards adjuvant radiotherapy in 2015 than in 2012 for two of three hypothetical clinical case scenarios with a high 10-year risk of biochemical relapse according to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomograms (P < 0.001 for both cases). In 2015, urologists were less positive overall towards the recommendation for post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy for men with locally advanced prostate cancer than in 2012 (P < 0.001), reflecting a significant change across a number of attitudes and beliefs. Of note, urologists felt other urologists would more likely be critical if they routinely referred the target patient group for radiotherapy in 2015 compared with 2012 (P = 0.007).

Fifteen couples were recruited from a cancer center multispecialty clinic, which gave full information about all options, including AS. Data were collected via individual, semi-structured telephone interviews. Most patients were white, non-Hispanic, had private insurance, had completed at least some college, and were aged 49-72 years. Ten chose AS. All partners were female, and couples reported strong marital satisfaction and cohesion. All couples described similar sequences of a highly emotional initial reaction and desire to be rid of the cancer, information seeking, and decision making. The choice of AS was built on a nuanced evaluation of the man's condition in which the couple differentiated prostate cancer from other cancers and early stage from later stages, wanted to avoid/delay side effects, and trusted the AS protocol to identify negative changes in time for successful treatment. Treated couples continued to want immediate treatment to remove the cancer. We concluded that having a partner's support for AS may help a man feel more comfortable with choosing and adhering to AS. Using decision aids that address both a man's and his partner's concerns regarding AS may increase its acceptability. Our research shows that some patients want to and do involve their partners in the decision-making process. Ethical issues are related to the tension between desire for partner involvement and the importance of the patient as autonomous decision-maker. The extended period of decision making, particularly for AS, is also an ethical issue that requires additional support for patients and couples in the making of fully informed choices that includes AS.""","""['Yen-Chi L Le', 'Stephanie L McFall', 'Theresa L Byrd', 'Robert J Volk', 'Scott B Cantor', 'Deborah A Kuban', 'Patricia Dolan Mullen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Narrat Inq Bioeth""","""[""'What is this active surveillance thing?'

T (30%) was primarily metabolised to DHT (10%) while low levels of A4, 5αDIONE and 3αADIOL (≈20%) were detected. Conjugated steroids were not detected and downstream products were present at <0.05μM. Only 20% of 11OHA4 and 11OHT were metabolised with the former yielding 11keto-androstenedione (11KA4), 11KDHT and 11β-hydroxy-5α-androstanedione (11OH-5αDIONE) and the latter yielding 11OHA4, 11KT and 11KDHT with downstream products <0.03μM. In LNCaP cells, A4 (90%) was metabolised to AST-glucuronide via the alternative pathway while T was detected as T-glucuronide with negligible conversion to downstream products. 11OHA4 (80%) and 11OHT (60%) were predominantly metabolised to 11KA4 and 11KT and in both assays more than 50% of 11KT was detected in the unconjugated form. In tissue, we detected C11-oxy C19 metabolites at significantly higher levels than the C19 steroids, with unconjugated 11KDHT, 11KT and 11OHA4 levels ranging between 13 and 37.5ng/g. Analyses of total steroid levels in plasma showed significant levels of 11OHA4 (≈230-440nM), 11KT (≈250-390nM) and 11KDHT (≈19nM). DHT levels (<0.14nM) were significantly lower. In summary, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity in PNT2 cells was substantially lower than in LNCaP cells, reflected in the conversion of 11OHA4 and 11OHT. Enzyme substrate preferences suggest that the alternate pathway is dominant in normal prostate cells. Glucuronidation activity was not detected in PNT2 cells and while all T derivatives were efficiently conjugated in LNCaP cells, 11KT was not. Substantial 11KT levels were also detected in both PCa tissue and plasma. 11OHA4 therefore presents a significant androgen precursor and its downstream metabolism to 11KT and 11KDHT as well as its presence in PCa tissue and plasma substantiate the importance of this adrenal androgen.""","""['Therina du Toit', 'Liezl M Bloem', 'Jonathan L Quanson', 'Riaan Ehlers', 'Antonio M Serafin', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Inefficient UGT-conjugation of adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites highlights C11-oxy C19 steroids as the predominant androgens in prostate cancer.', 'The 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione pathway and C11-oxy C21 backdoor pathway are active in benign prostatic hyperplasia yielding 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-progesterone.', '11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, the product of androstenedione metabolism in the adrenal, is metabolized in LNCaP cells by 5α-reductase yielding 11β-hydroxy-5α-androstanedione.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', '11β-Hydroxyandrostenedione: Downstream metabolism by 11βHSD, 17βHSD and SRD5A produces novel substrates in familiar pathways.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Inclusion of 11-Oxygenated Androgens in a Clinical Routine LC-MS/MS Setup for Steroid Hormone Profiling.', 'Profiles of 5α-Reduced Androgens in Humans and Eels: 5α-Dihydrotestosterone and 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone Are Active Androgens Produced in Eel Gonads.', 'The Unique Role of 11-Oxygenated C19 Steroids in Both Premature Adrenarche and Premature Pubarche.', 'Gut feelings about bacterial steroid-17,20-desmolase.']"""

For this combined pre- and intraoperative SN identification was realized using the hybrid SN tracer, indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid. Combining this dedicated SN tracer with a lymphangiographic tracer such as fluorescein may further enhance the accuracy of SN biopsy.  Objective:   Clinical evaluation of a multispectral fluorescence guided surgery approach using the dedicated SN tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid, the lymphangiographic tracer fluorescein, and a commercially available fluorescence laparoscope.  Design, setting, and participants:   Pilot study in ten patients with prostate cancer. Following ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid administration and preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomograpy imaging, the number and location of SNs were determined. Fluorescein was injected intraprostatically immediately after the patient was anesthetized. A multispectral fluorescence laparoscope was used intraoperatively to identify both fluorescent signatures.  Surgical procedure:   Multispectral fluorescence imaging during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection and SN biopsy.  Measurements:   (1) Number and location of preoperatively identified SNs. (2) Number and location of SNs intraoperatively identified via ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid imaging. (3) Rate of intraoperative lymphatic duct identification via fluorescein imaging. (4) Tumor status of excised (sentinel) lymph node(s). (5) Postoperative complications and follow-up.  Results and limitations:   Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid visualized 85.3% of the SNs. In 8/10 patients, fluorescein imaging allowed bright and accurate identification of lymphatic ducts, although higher background staining and tracer washout were observed. The main limitation is the small patient population.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that a lymphangiographic tracer can provide additional information during SN biopsy based on ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid. The study suggests that multispectral fluorescence image-guided surgery is clinically feasible.  Patient summary:   We evaluated the concept of surgical fluorescence guidance using differently colored dyes that visualize complementary features. In the future this concept may provide better guidance towards diseased tissue while sparing healthy tissue, and could thus improve functional and oncologic outcomes.""","""['Nynke S van den Berg', 'Tessa Buckle', 'Gijs H KleinJan', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Optimisation of fluorescence guidance during robot-assisted laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy for prostate cancer.', 'Hybrid Indocyanine Green-99mTc-nanocolloid for Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography and Combined Radio- and Fluorescence-guided Sentinel Node Biopsy in Penile Cancer: Results of 740 Inguinal Basins Assessed at a Single Institution.', 'Relationship between intraprostatic tracer deposits and sentinel lymph node mapping in prostate cancer patients.', 'Advances in sentinel node dissection in prostate cancer from a technical perspective.', 'Sentinel node approach in prostate cancer.', 'The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment.', 'Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection in Colorectal Cancer with Lymph Node Metastasis: A Systematic Review.', 'Fluorescence-guided radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiplexed imaging in oncology.', 'Precision surgery: the role of intra-operative real-time image guidance - outcomes from a multidisciplinary European consensus conference.']"""

However, the success of this novel therapy is limited due to inefficient delivery of the virus to the target sites. In this study, we used dendritic cells (DCs) as carriers for conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) in targeting prostate carcinoma (PCa).  Methods:   Four types of CRAds, including Ad-PC (without PCa-specific promoter and a recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, rmhTNF, sequence), Ad-PC-rmhTNF (without PCa-specific promoter), Ad-PPC-NCS (without an rmhTNF sequence) and Ad-PPC-rmhTNF, were constructed. The androgen-insensitive mouse PCa RM-1 cells were co-cultured with CRAd-loading DCs, and the viability of RM-1 cells was examined using MTT assay. The in vivo effects of CRAd-loading DCs on PCa were evaluated in RM-1 xenograft mouse model.  Results:   Two PCa-specific CRAds (Ad-PPC-NCS, Ad-PPC-rmhTNF) exhibited more potent suppression on the viability of RM-1 cells in vitro than the PCa-non-specific CRAds (Ad-PC, Ad-PC-rmhTNF). In PCa-bearing mice, intravenous injection of the PCa-specific CRAd-loading DCs significantly inhibited the growth of xenografted tumors, extended the survival time, and induced T-cell activation. Additionally, the rmhTNF-containing CRAds exhibited greater tumor killing ability than CRAds without rmhTNF.

Methods:   We measured serum PSA levels in 1472 healthy men 50 or more years old. Men who had serum PSA values 4.0ng/mL or higher underwent digital rectal examination. If there were either an elevated PSA level (≥4ng/mL) or abnormal digital rectal examination, a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy was performed.  Results:   The mean serum total PSA level was 13.73±11.44ng/mL, and the mean serum free PSA level was 4.99±0.97ng/mL. Of the 260 men who had serum total PSA levels of≥4ng/mL, 139 underwent biopsy. Of these 139 men, 45 (32.4%) had prostate cancer. Benign prostatic hyperplasia with or without prostatitis was diagnosed in 94 patients (67.6%). There was no significant correlation between age and histologic results of prostate needle biopsy (P-value=0.469). The serum free PSA showed no significant correlation with histologic results of prostate needle biopsy, whereas the serum total PSA level had a significant correlation in patients with adenocarcinoma compared with other diagnosis.  Conclusions:   The overall frequency of detection of prostate adenocarcinoma was 32.4%. This study revealed that no level of PSA was associated with a 100% positive predictive value and negative biopsy can occur virtually at any PSA level.

Several large scale tissue microarray studies have revealed that the expression of some Notch signaling components including the Jagged1 ligand are upregulated in advanced human prostate cancer specimens. Jagged1 expressed by tumor cells may activate Notch signaling in both adjacent tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment. However, it remains undetermined whether increased Jagged1 expression reflects a cause for or a consequence of tumor progression in vivo. To address this question, we generated a novel R26-LSL-JAG1 mouse model that enables spatiotemporal Jagged1 expression. Prostate specific upregulation of Jagged1 neither interferes with prostate epithelial homeostasis nor significantly accelerates tumor initiation or progression in the prostate-specific Pten deletion mouse model for prostate cancer. However, Jagged1 upregulation results in increased inflammatory foci in tumors and incidence of intracystic adenocarcinoma. In addition, Jagged1 overexpression upregulates Tgfβ signaling in prostate stromal cells and promotes progression of a reactive stromal microenvironment in the Pten null prostate cancer model. Collectively, Jagged1 overexpression does not significantly accelerate prostate cancer initiation and progression in the context of loss-of-function of Pten, but alters tumor histopathology and microenvironment.

MVCT images have the potential to provide daily bowel segmentation. We assess the feasibility of deformable registration and contour propagation in replacing manual BL segmentation on MVCT. Four observers delineated BL on the planning kVCT and on one therapy MVCT in eight patients. Inter-observer variations in BLs contouring were quantified using DICE index. BLs were then automatically propagated onto MVCT by a commercial software for image deformation and subsequently manually corrected. The agreement between propagated BL/propagated+manually corrected BL vs manual were quantified using the DICE. Contouring times were also compared. The impact on DVH of using the deformable-registration method was assessed. The same procedures were repeated on high-resolution planning-kVCT and therapy-kVCT. MVCTs are adequate to visualize BL (average DICE: 0.815), although worse than kVCT (average DICE:0.889). When comparing propagated vs manual BL, a poor agreement was found (average DICE: 0.564/0.646 for MVCT/KVCT). After manual correction, average DICE indexes increased to 0.810/0.897. The contouring time was reduced to 15min with the semi-automatic approach from 30min with manual contouring. DVH parameters of propagated BL were significantly different from manual BL (p<0.0001); after manual correction, no significant differences were seen. MVCT are suitable for BL visualization. The use of a software to segment BL on MVCT starting from BL-kVCT contours was feasible if followed by manual correction. The method resulted in a substantial reduction of contouring time without detrimental effect on the quality of bowel segmentation and DVH estimates.""","""['L Perna', 'C Sini', 'C Cozzarini', 'G Agnello', 'G M Cattaneo', 'L B Hysing', 'L P Muren', 'C Fiorino', 'R Calandrino']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Deformable registration of the planning image (kVCT) and the daily images (MVCT) for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Automatic contour propagation using deformable image registration to determine delivered dose to spinal cord in head-and-neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'An automatic contour propagation method to follow parotid gland deformation during head-and-neck cancer tomotherapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Megavoltage CT images of helical tomotherapy unit for radiation treatment simulation: impact on feasibility of treatment planning in a prostate cancer patient with bilateral femoral prostheses.', 'Implementing cone-beam computed tomography-guided online adaptive radiotherapy in cervical cancer.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', 'Registration methods in radiotherapy.', 'Segmentation of parotid glands from registered CT and MR images.', 'Evaluation of Deformable Image Registration-Based Contour Propagation From Planning CT to Cone-Beam CT.']"""

The study developed and tested an intervention to address sexual, relational, and emotional aspects of the relationship after prostate cancer by incorporating elements of family systems theory and sex therapy.  Aims:   To develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of relational psychosexual treatment for couples with prostate cancer, determine whether a relational-psychosexual intervention is feasible and acceptable for couples affected by prostate cancer, and determine the parameters for a full-scale trial.  Methods:   Forty-three couples were recruited for this pilot randomized controlled trial and received a six-session manual-based psychosexual intervention or usual care. Outcomes were measured before, after, and 6 months after the intervention. Acceptability and feasibility were established from recruitment and retention rates and adherence to the manual.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome measurement was the sexual bother subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 15-item Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15) were used to measure emotional and relational functioning, respectively.  Results:   The intervention was feasible and acceptable. The trial achieved adequate recruitment (38%) and retention (74%) rates. The intervention had a clinically and statistically significant effect on sexual bother immediately after the intervention. Small decreases in anxiety and depression were observed for the intervention couples, although these were not statistically significant. Practitioners reported high levels of adherence to the manual.  Conclusion:   The clinically significant impact on sexual bother and positive feedback on the study's feasibility and acceptability indicate that the intervention should be tested in a multicenter trial. The SCORE-15 lacked specificity for this intervention, and future trials would benefit from a couple-focused measurement.""","""['Jane Robertson', 'Phillip McNamee', 'Gerry Molloy', 'Gill Hubbard', 'Alan McNeill', 'Prasad Bollina', 'Daniel Kelly', 'Liz Forbat']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Editorial Comment on ""Couple-Based Psychosexual Support Following Prostate Cancer Surgery: Results of a Feasibility Pilot Randomized Control Trial"".', 'Response to Editorial Comment ""There\'s a Long Way to Go, But Now We\xa0Have a Map"".', 'Exploring the feasibility and acceptability of couple-based psychosexual support following prostate cancer surgery: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.', 'Feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel cognitive-behavioral couple therapy for provoked vestibulodynia: a pilot study.', 'TrueNTH sexual recovery study protocol: a multi-institutional collaborative approach to developing and testing a web-based intervention for couples coping with the side-effects of prostate cancer treatment in a randomized controlled trial.', 'Communication and intimacy-enhancing interventions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their partners.', 'The psychosocial aspects of sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Positive Psychology Approaches to Interventions for Cancer Dyads: A Scoping Review.', 'The Challenges of Enrollment and Retention: A Systematic Review of Psychosocial Behavioral Interventions for Patients With Cancer and Their Family Caregivers.', 'The effectiveness of psychological intervention for depression, anxiety, and distress in prostate cancer: a systematic review of literature.', 'The need for supportive mental wellbeing interventions in bladder cancer patients: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Current management strategy of treating patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The primary endpoint is to test the safety of SBRT for the treatment of 2 to 4 multiple lesions in several anatomic sites in a multi-institutional setting. Because of the technical challenges inherent to treating multiple lesions as their spatial separation decreases, we present the technical requirements for NRG-BR001 and the rationale for their selection.  Methods and materials:   Patients with controlled primary tumors of breast, non-small cell lung, or prostate are eligible if they have 2 to 4 metastases distributed among 7 extracranial anatomic locations throughout the body. Prescription and organ-at-risk doses were determined by expert consensus. Credentialing requirements include (1) irradiation of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core phantom with SBRT, (2) submitting image guided radiation therapy case studies, and (3) planning the benchmark. Guidelines for navigating challenging planning cases including assessing composite dose are discussed.  Results:   Dosimetric planning to multiple lesions receiving differing doses (45-50 Gy) and fractionation (3-5) while irradiating the same organs at risk is discussed, particularly for metastases in close proximity (≤5 cm). The benchmark case was selected to demonstrate the planning tradeoffs required to satisfy protocol requirements for 2 nearby lesions. Examples of passing benchmark plans exhibited a large variability in plan conformity.  Discussion:   NRG-BR001 was developed using expert consensus on multiple issues from the dose fractionation regimen to the minimum image guided radiation therapy guidelines. Credentialing was tied to the task rather than the anatomic site to reduce its burden. Every effort was made to include a variety of delivery methods to reflect current SBRT technology. Although some simplifications were adopted, the successful completion of this trial will inform future designs of both national and institutional trials and would allow immediate clinical adoption of SBRT trials for oligometastases.""","""['Hania A Al-Hallaq', 'Steven Chmura', 'Joseph K Salama', 'Kathryn A Winter', 'Clifford G Robinson', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'Virginia Borges', 'Jessica R Lowenstein', 'Susan McNulty', 'James M Galvin', 'David S Followill', 'Robert D Timmerman', 'Julia R White', 'Ying Xiao', 'Martha M Matuszak']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Benchmark Credentialing Results for NRG-BR001: The First National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Multiple Metastases.', 'Evaluation of Safety of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Patients With Multiple Metastases: Findings From the NRG-BR001 Phase 1 Trial.', 'Efficacy of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) added to\xa0standard treatment in patients with solid tumors (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer)\xa0with up to 3 bone-only metastases: study protocol for a randomised phase III trial (STEREO-OS).', 'What do radiation oncologists require for future advancements in lung SBRT?', 'Extracranial radiosurgery (stereotactic body radiation therapy) for oligometastases.', 'How much rotational error is clinically acceptable for single-isocenter/two-lesion lung SBRT treatment on halcyon ring delivery system (RDS)?', 'Feasibility and dosimetric evaluation of single- and multi-isocentre stereotactic body radiation therapy for multiple liver metastases.', 'Evaluation of flattening-filter-free and flattening filter dosimetric and radiobiological criteria for lung SBRT: A volume-based analysis.', 'The oligometastatic spectrum in the era of improved detection and modern systemic therapy.', 'Impact of magnetic resonance-guided versus conventional radiotherapy workflows on organ at risk doses in stereotactic body radiotherapy for lymph node oligometastases.']"""
