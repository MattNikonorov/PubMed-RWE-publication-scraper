However, administrative data may underestimate life expectancy in patients who undergo screening.  Objective:   To determine the association between receipt of screening mammography or PSA and overall survival.  Design:   Retrospective cohort study from 1/1/1999 to 12/31/2012. Receipt of screening was assessed for 2001-2002 and survival from 1/1/2003 to 12/31/2012. Life expectancy was estimated as of 1/1/03 using a validated algorithm, and was compared to actual survival for men and women, stratified by receipt of cancer screening.  Participants:   A 5 % sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 69-90 years as of 1/1/2003 (n = 906,723).  Interventions:   Receipt of screening mammography in 2001-2002 for women, or a screening PSA test in 2002 for men.  Main measures:   Survival from 1/1/2003 through 12/31/2012.  Key results:   Subjects were stratified by life expectancy based on age and comorbidity. Within each stratum, the subjects with prior cancer screening had actual median survivals higher than those who were not screened, with differences ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 years for women and 0.9 to 1.1 years for men. In a Cox model, non-receipt of screening in women had an impact on survival (HR = 1.52; 95 % CI = 1.51, 1.54) similar in magnitude to a diagnosis of complicated diabetes or heart failure, and was comparable to uncomplicated diabetes or liver disease in men (HR = 1.23; 1.22, 1.25).  Conclusions:   Receipt of cancer screening is a powerful marker of health status that is not captured by comorbidity measures in administrative data. Because life expectancy algorithms using administrative data underestimate the life expectancy of patients who undergo screening, they can overestimate the problem of cancer screening in patients with limited life expectancy.""","""['James S Goodwin', 'Kristin Sheffield', 'Shuang Li', 'Alai Tan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Capsule Commentary on Goodwin et al., Receipt of Cancer Screening is a Predictor of Life Expectancy.', 'Association Between Receipt of Cancer Screening and All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults.', 'Influence of Age, Health, and Function on Cancer Screening in Older Adults with Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Medical center characteristics associated with PSA screening in elderly veterans with limited life expectancy.', 'Benefits and Harms of Breast Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review.', 'Screening mammography in older women: a review.', 'Extending Age Ranges in Breast Cancer Screening in Four European Countries: Model Estimations of Harm-to-Benefit Ratios.', 'Association Between Receipt of Cancer Screening and All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults.', 'Use of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography in the Medicare Population.', 'Association of Nonadherence to Cancer Screening Examinations With Mortality From Unrelated Causes: A Secondary Analysis of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Use of Breast Cancer Screening and Its Association with Later Use of Preventive Services among Medicare Beneficiaries.']"""

We sought to determine whether AsAs are under-utilizing recommended cancer screening.  Methods:   Cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System comprising of AsAs and non-Hispanic White (NHW) community-dwelling individuals (English and Spanish speaking) eligible for colorectal, breast, cervical, or prostate cancer screening according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations. Age, education and income level, residence location, marital status, health insurance, regular access to healthcare provider, and screening were extracted. Complex samples logistic regression models quantified the effect of race on odds of undergoing appropriate screening. Data were analyzed in 2015.  Results:   Weighted samples of 63.3, 33.3, 47.9, and 30.3 million individuals eligible for colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening identified, respectively. In general, AsAs were more educated, more often married, had higher levels of income, and lived in urban/suburban residencies as compared to NHWs (all p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses, AsAs had lower odds of undergoing colorectal (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.96), cervical (OR 0.45, 95 % CI 0.36-0.55), and prostate cancer (OR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.39-0.78) screening and similar odds of undergoing breast cancer (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 0.92-1.82) screening as compared to NHWs.  Conclusions:   AsAs are less likely to undergo appropriate screening for colorectal, cervical, and prostate cancer. Contributing reasons include limitations in healthcare access, differing cultural beliefs on cancer screening and treatment, and potential physician biases.

Methods:   We retrospectively collected information regarding cancer diagnoses and diagnosis of PD from 971 unrelated PD patients and 478 controls, and all were white. For PD patients, we examined cancers diagnosed before and after PD diagnosis separately in addition to considering all cancer diagnoses.  Results:   Twenty different cancers were identified. In PD patients, the most common types of cancer were skin cancer (17.3% overall; 10.6% before PD), followed by nonmelanoma skin cancer (16.0% overall; 9.7% before PD), prostate cancer in men (12.8% overall; 9.2% before PD), breast cancer in women (10.6% overall; 6.3% before PD), and melanoma (2.4% overall; 1.1% before PD). Compared to controls, a significantly lower frequency of nonmelanoma skin cancer (odds ratio [OR]: 0.62, P = 0.0024) and any skin cancer (OR: 0.57, P = 0.0002) was observed in PD patients. These differences were greater when considering only cases with cancers that occurred before PD diagnosis (OR: 0.49, P < 0.0001; OR: 0.45, P < 0.0001, respectively), and there was a lower frequency of melanoma and any cancer preceding PD diagnosis compared to controls (OR: 0.31, P = 0.003; OR: 0.36, P < 0.0001).

Methods The paraffin-embedded specimens of prostate cancer (n=20) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (n=20) were collected. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of ezrin mRNA and protein in prostate tissues, respectively. After culturing, human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were treated with culture solution, Scramble siRNA and ezrin siRNA for 48 hours. Cell proliferation was analyzed through MTT method. Cell invasion ability was measured using Transwell(TM) invasion experiment. In addition, the levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin were examined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting. Results The expression levels of ezrin mRNA and protein in prostate cancer tissues were higher than those in the tissues from benign prostatic hyperplasia patients. In comparison with PC-3 cells treated with Scramble siRNA, following the downregulation of ezrin expression, PC-3 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and mean cell number of penetrated membrane and N-cadherin level were reduced, whereas E-cadherin level was raised. There was no statistical difference in the above indicators between Scramble siRNA-treated PC-3 cells and pure culture solution-treated PC-3 cells.

KLKs are involved in coordination of numerous physiological functions including regulation of blood pressure, neuronal plasticity, skin desquamation, and semen liquefaction, and thus represent promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Until now, quantification of KLKs in biological and clinical samples was accomplished by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Here, we developed multiplex targeted mass spectrometry assays for the simultaneous quantification of all 15 KLKs. Proteotypic peptides for each KLK were carefully selected based on experimental data and multiplexed in single assays. Performance of assays was evaluated using three different mass spectrometry platforms including triple quadrupole, quadrupole-ion trap, and quadrupole-orbitrap instruments. Heavy isotope-labeled synthetic peptides with a quantifying tag were used for absolute quantification of KLKs in sweat, cervico-vaginal fluid, seminal plasma, and blood serum, with limits of detection ranging from 5 to 500 ng/ml. Analytical performance of assays was evaluated by measuring endogenous KLKs in relevant biological fluids, and results were compared with selected ELISAs. The multiplex targeted proteomic assays were demonstrated to be accurate, reproducible, sensitive, and specific alternatives to antibody-based assays. Finally, KLK4, a highly prostate-specific protein and a speculated biomarker of prostate cancer, was unambiguously detected and quantified by immunoenrichment-SRM assay in seminal plasma and blood serum samples from individuals with confirmed prostate cancer and negative biopsy. Mass spectrometry revealed exclusively the presence of a secreted isoform and thus unequivocally resolved earlier disputes about KLK4 identity in seminal plasma. Measurements of KLK4 in either 41 seminal plasma or 58 blood serum samples revealed no statistically significant differences between patients with confirmed prostate cancer and negative biopsy. The presented multiplex targeted proteomic assays are an alternative analytical tool to study the biological and pathological roles of human KLKs.""","""['Theano D Karakosta', 'Antoninus Soosaipillai', 'Eleftherios P Diamandis', 'Ihor Batruch', 'Andrei P Drabovich']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Activation profiles of human kallikrein-related peptidases by proteases of the thrombostasis axis.', 'Association between kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and macroscopic indicators of semen analysis: their relation to sperm motility.', 'Activation and activity of glycosylated KLKs 3, 4 and 11.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) as emerging therapeutic targets: focus on prostate cancer and skin pathologies.', 'Overview of tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases in breast cancer.', 'Germ Cell-Specific Proteins AKAP4 and ASPX Facilitate Identification of Rare Spermatozoa in Non-Obstructive Azoospermia.', 'Rational Design and Development of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Diagnostics by Immunoprecipitation-Targeted Proteomics.', 'Transcriptome profiling and proteomic validation reveals targets of the androgen receptor signaling in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line.', 'Beyond liquid biopsy: Toward non-invasive assays for distanced cancer diagnostics in pandemics.', 'Recent Developments and Applications of Quantitative Proteomics Strategies for High-Throughput Biomolecular Analyses in Cancer Research.']"""

For HDR, the average excess absolute risks for second rectal and bladder cancers were 0.74 and 1.62 per 10,000 PY respectively. The absolute differences between techniques were very low and clinically irrelevant. Compared to external beam prostate radiotherapy techniques, LDR and HDR brachytherapy resulted in the lowest risks of second rectal and bladder cancer.  Conclusions:   This study shows both LDR and HDR brachytherapy monotherapy result in low estimated risks of radiation-induced rectal and bladder cancer. LDR resulted in lower bladder cancer risks than HDR, and lower or similar risks of rectal cancer. In absolute terms these differences between techniques were very small. Compared to external beam techniques, second rectal and bladder cancer risks were lowest for brachytherapy.""","""['Louise Murray', 'Joshua Mason', 'Ann M Henry', 'Peter Hoskin', 'Frank-Andre Siebert', 'Jack Venselaar', 'Peter Bownes;UroGEC/BRAPHYQS group of the GEC ESTRO']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['High dose rate brachytherapy as prostate cancer monotherapy reduces toxicity compared to low dose rate palladium seeds.', 'Normal tissue dosimetric comparison between HDR prostate implant boost and conformal external beam radiotherapy boost: potential for dose escalation.', 'A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'High-dose-rate vs. low-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy for carcinoma of the uterine cervix: Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Normal Tissue Integral Dose as a Result of Prostate Radiation Therapy: A Quantitative Comparison Between High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy and Modern External Beam Radiation Therapy Techniques.', 'Radioactive Iodine-125 in Tumor Therapy: Advances and Future Directions.', 'High prevalence of secondary bladder cancer in men on radiotherapy for prostate cancer: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

We performed independent external validation of published predictive models for urinary dysfunctions following radiotherapy of the prostate.  Materials/methods:   Multivariable models developed to predict atomised and generalised urinary symptoms, both acute and late, were considered for validation using a dataset representing 754 participants from the TROG 03.04-RADAR trial. Endpoints and features were harmonised to match the predictive models. The overall performance, calibration and discrimination were assessed.  Results:   14 models from four publications were validated. The discrimination of the predictive models in an independent external validation cohort, measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ranged from 0.473 to 0.695, generally lower than in internal validation. 4 models had ROC >0.6. Shrinkage was required for all predictive models' coefficients ranging from -0.309 (prediction probability was inverse to observed proportion) to 0.823. Predictive models which include baseline symptoms as a feature produced the highest discrimination. Two models produced a predicted probability of 0 and 1 for all patients.  Conclusions:   Predictive models vary in performance and transferability illustrating the need for improvements in model development and reporting. Several models showed reasonable potential but efforts should be increased to improve performance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to CT for anatomical delineation, but identification of the negative-contrast seeds is challenging. Positive-contrast MRI markers were proposed to replace spacers to assist seed localization on MRI images. Visualization of these markers under varying scan parameters was investigated.  Methods:   To simulate a clinical scenario, a prostate phantom was implanted with 66 markers and 86 seeds, and imaged on a 3.0T MRI scanner using a 3D fast radiofrequency-spoiled gradient recalled echo acquisition with various combinations of scan parameters. Scan parameters, including flip angle, number of excitations, bandwidth, field-of-view, slice thickness, and encoding steps were systematically varied to study their effects on signal, noise, scan time, image resolution, and artifacts.  Results:   The effects of pulse sequence parameter selection on the marker signal strength and image noise were characterized. The authors also examined the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio, scan time, and image artifacts, such as the wraparound artifact, susceptibility artifact, chemical shift artifact, and partial volume averaging artifact. Given reasonable scan time and managable artifacts, the authors recommended scan parameter combinations that can provide robust visualization of the MRI markers.

Methods:   The original VMERGE algorithm first computes an ""ideal,"" high quality but also highly time consuming treatment plan that irradiates the patient from all possible angles in a fine angular grid with a highly modulated beam and then makes this plan deliverable within practical treatment time by an iterative fluence map merging and sequencing algorithm. We propose two changes to this method. First, we regularize the ideal plan obtained in the first step by adding an explicit constraint on treatment time. Second, we propose a different merging criterion that comprises of identifying and merging adjacent maps whose merging results in the least degradation of radiation dose.  Results:   The effect of both suggested modifications is evaluated individually and jointly on clinical prostate and paraspinal cases. Details of the two cases are reported.  Conclusions:   In the authors' computational study they found that both proposed modifications, especially the regularization, yield noticeably improved treatment plans for the same treatment times than what can be obtained using the original VMERGE method.

Such serious incidents can be avoided by performing dose verification online, i.e., while the patient is being irradiated, creating the possibility of halting the linac in case of a large overdosage or underdosage. The offline EPID-based 3D in vivo dosimetry system clinically employed at our institute is in principle suited for online treatment verification, provided the system is able to complete 3D dose reconstruction and verification within 420 ms, the present acquisition time of a single EPID frame. It is the aim of this study to show that our EPID-based dosimetry system can be made fast enough to achieve online 3D in vivo dose verification.  Methods:   The current dose verification system was sped up in two ways. First, a new software package was developed to perform all computations that are not dependent on portal image acquisition separately, thus removing the need for doing these calculations in real time. Second, the 3D dose reconstruction algorithm was sped up via a new, multithreaded implementation. Dose verification was implemented by comparing planned with reconstructed 3D dose distributions delivered to two regions in a patient: the target volume and the nontarget volume receiving at least 10 cGy. In both volumes, the mean dose is compared, while in the nontarget volume, the near-maximum dose (D2) is compared as well. The real-time dosimetry system was tested by irradiating an anthropomorphic phantom with three VMAT plans: a 6 MV head-and-neck treatment plan, a 10 MV rectum treatment plan, and a 10 MV prostate treatment plan. In all plans, two types of serious delivery errors were introduced. The functionality of automatically halting the linac was also implemented and tested.  Results:   The precomputation time per treatment was ∼180 s/treatment arc, depending on gantry angle resolution. The complete processing of a single portal frame, including dose verification, took 266 ± 11 ms on a dual octocore Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU running at 2.40 GHz. The introduced delivery errors were detected after 5-10 s irradiation time.  Conclusions:   A prototype online 3D dose verification tool using portal imaging has been developed and successfully tested for two different kinds of gross delivery errors. Thus, online 3D dose verification has been technologically achieved.""","""['Hanno Spreeuw', 'Roel Rozendaal', 'Igor Olaciregui-Ruiz', 'Patrick González', 'Anton Mans', 'Ben Mijnheer', 'Marcel van Herk']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Frame average optimization of cine-mode EPID images used for routine clinical in vivo patient dose verification of VMAT deliveries.', 'Validation of a method for in vivo 3D dose reconstruction for IMRT and VMAT treatments using on-treatment EPID images and a model-based forward-calculation algorithm.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Set-up verification using portal imaging; review of current clinical practice.', 'Extending in aqua portal dosimetry with dose inhomogeneity conversion maps for accurate patient dose reconstruction in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', 'Evaluation of Daily CT for EPID-Based Transit In Vivo Dosimetry.', 'Optimisation of a composite difference metric for prompt error detection in real-time portal dosimetry of simulated volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.']"""

However, little data exist regarding the preservation of tumor-associated cells in cryopreserved collections. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using the CellSieve™ microfiltration assay for the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) from cryopreserved PBMC samples.  Methods:   Blood samples spiked with breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3), and renal (786-O) cancer cell lines were used to establish analytical accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility after cryopreservation. The spiked samples were processed through Ficoll separation, and cryopreservation was followed by thawing and microfiltration.  Results:   MCF-7 cells were successfully retrieved with recovery efficiencies of 90.5 % without cryopreservation and 87.8 and 89.0 %, respectively, on day 7 and day 66 following cryopreservation. The corresponding recovery efficiencies of PC-3 cells were 83.3 % without cryopreservation and 85.3 and 84.7 %, respectively, after cryopreservation. Recovery efficiencies of 786-O cells were 92.7 % without cryopreservation, and 82.7 and 81.3 %, respectively, after cryopreservation. The recovered cells retained the morphologic characteristics and immunohistochemical markers that had been observed before freezing. The protocols were further validated by quantitation of CAMLs in blood samples from two patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The recovery rates of CTCs and CAMLs from cryopreserved samples were not statistically significant different (P > 0.05) from matched fresh samples.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first report that CAMLs could be cryopreserved and analyzed after thawing with microfiltration technology.

Acquisition time was kept similar for both acquisitions. Two radiologists evaluated aspects of IQ on a 5-point Likert scale and classified image artifacts. All patients completed a questionnaire on discomfort/pain regarding the ER coil using a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10.  Results:   There was no significant difference in overall IQ for T2w images for both readers (reader 1, 3.27 ± 0.91 and 3.07 ± 0.84, p = 0.057; reader 2, 3.70 ± 0.75 and 3.77 ± 0.81, p = 0.555) for PPA and ER coils, respectively. Overall IQ for DWI acquired with PPA and ER coils was rated similar by reader 1 (3.03 ± 1.10 and 3.08 ± 0.80, respectively, (p = 0.67)), while reader 2 preferred ER coil images (3.27 ± 0.81 and 3.66 ± 0.85 (p < 0.05)).

Practitioners are poor judges of men's preferences, contributing to preference misdiagnosis and unwarranted practice variation. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) can support men with decisions about localized prostate cancer. This is a comparative case study of two strategies for implementing PtDAs in clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer, evaluating (a) PtDA use; (b) impact on men, practitioners, and health system outcomes; and (c) factors influencing sustained use.  Methods/design:   Guided by the Knowledge to Action Framework, this comparative case study will be conducted using administrative data, interviews, and surveys. Cases will be bound by geographic location (one hospital in Ontario; province of Saskatchewan) and time. Eligible participants will be all men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, with outcomes assessed using administrative data and interviews. Nurses, urologists, radiation oncologists, and managers will be surveyed and a smaller sample interviewed. Cases will be established for each setting with findings compared across cases. Changes in the proportions of men given the PtDA over 2 years will be determined from administrative data. Factors associated with receiving the PtDA will be explored using multivariable logistic regression analysis. To assess the impact of the PtDA, outcomes will be described using mean and standard deviation (men's decisional conflict) and frequency and proportions (practitioners consulted, uptake of treatment). To estimate the effect of the PtDA on these outcomes, adjusted mean differences and odds ratios will be calculated using exploratory multivariable general linear regression and binary or multinomial logistic regression. Factors influencing sustained PtDA use will be assessed using descriptive analysis of survey findings and thematic analysis of interview transcripts.  Discussion:   Determining how to embed PtDAs effectively within clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer is essential. PtDAs have the potential to strengthen men's active role in making prostate cancer decisions, enhance uptake of shared decision-making by practitioners, and reduce practice variation. Our team of researchers and knowledge users will use findings to improve current PtDA use and consider scaling-up implementation.""","""['Dawn Stacey', 'Monica Taljaard', 'Jennifer Smylie', 'Laura Boland', 'Rodney H Breau', 'Meg Carley', 'Kunal Jana', 'Larry Peckford', 'Terry Blackmore', 'Marian Waldie', 'Robert Chi Wu', 'France Legare']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Implement Sci""","""['A Patient Decision Aid for Men With Localized Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Case Study of Natural Implementation Approaches.', ""Implementing a breast cancer patient decision aid: Process evaluation using medical files and the patients' perspective."", 'Are Patient Decision Aids Used in Clinical Practice after Rigorous Evaluation?

Recent studies have shown that increased collagen deposition and tissue stiffness in the peri-urethral area of the prostate are associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and urinary obstructive symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine whether Resveratrol might be useful to inhibit or revert TGFβ- and/or CXCL12-mediated myofibroblast phenoconversion of prostate fibroblasts in vitro, and therefore whether the use of anti-fibrotic therapeutics might be efficacious for the treatment of LUTD.  Methods:   Primary prostate and lung tissues were explanted and fibroblast monolayers expanded in vitro. Primary and N1 immortalized prostate stromal fibroblasts, as well as primary fibroblasts cultured from a normal lung and one affected by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for comparison, were grown in serum-free defined media supplemented with vehicle, TGFβ or CXCL12, pre- or post-treatment with Resveratrol, and were evaluated using immunofluorescence for alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen I (COL1) protein expression and assessed for cell proliferation, apoptosis, and COL1 and EGR1 transcript expression.  Results:   This study showed that low concentrations of Resveratrol (≤50 μM) had no effect on N1 or primary prostate fibroblast cell proliferation, apoptosis, or COL1 or EGR1 gene transcription but repressed and reversed myofibroblast phenoconversion. As expected, these same effects were observed for IPF lung fibroblasts though higher levels of Resveratrol (≥100uM) were required. Taken together, these data suggest that, like lung fibroblasts, prostate fibroblast to myofibroblast phenoconversion can be both repressed and reversed by Resveratrol treatment. Thus, anti-fibrotic therapeutics might be efficacious for the treatment of LUTD.""","""['Mehrnaz Gharaee-Kermani', 'Bethany B Moore', 'Jill A Macoska']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis Activation Mediates Prostate Myofibroblast Phenoconversion through Non-Canonical EGFR/MEK/ERK Signaling.', 'CXC-type chemokines promote myofibroblast phenoconversion and prostatic fibrosis.', 'Resveratrol causes cell cycle arrest, decreased collagen synthesis, and apoptosis in rat intestinal smooth muscle cells.', 'Research Progress in Elucidating the Mechanisms Underlying Resveratrol Action on Lung Cancer.', 'Resveratrol commonly displays hormesis: occurrence and biomedical significance.', 'The Effects of Resveratrol on Prostate Cancer through Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Resveratrol reduces inflammation-related Prostate Fibrosis.', 'Inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis prevents periurethral collagen accumulation and lower urinary tract dysfunction in vivo.', 'Redox Imbalance in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Role for Oxidant Cross-Talk Between NADPH Oxidase Enzymes and Mitochondria.', 'Uropathogenic Escherichia coli-induced fibrosis, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms, is associated with type 2 cytokine signaling.']"""

Patients and methods:   From January 2010 to October 2015, 4459 men meeting inclusion criteria underwent RP and pelvic lymphadenectomy for histologically confirmed prostate cancer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Preoperative clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and biopsy Gleason score (i.e. prognostic Grade Group) were used in a polychotomous logistic regression model to predict the probability of pathological outcomes categorised as: organ-confined (OC), extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle involvement (SV+), or lymph node involvement (LN+). Preoperative characteristics and pathological findings in men treated with RP since 1983 were collected and clinical-pathological trends were described.  Results:   The median (range) age at surgery was 60 (34-77) years and the median (range) PSA level was 4.9 (0.1-125.0) ng/mL. The observed probabilities of pathological outcomes were: OC disease in 74%, EPE in 20%, SV+ in 4%, and LN+ in 2%. The probability of EPE increased substantially when biopsy Gleason score increased from 6 (Grade Group 1, GG1) to 3 + 4 (GG2), with smaller increases for higher grades. The probability of LN+ was substantially higher for biopsy Gleason score 9-10 (GG5) as compared to lower Gleason scores. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for binary logistic models predicting EPE, SV+, and LN+ vs OC were 0.724, 0.856, and 0.918, respectively. The proportion of men treated with biopsy Gleason score ≤6 cancer (GG1) was 47%, representing a substantial decrease from 63% in the previous cohort and 77% in 2000-2005. The proportion of men with OC cancer has remained similar during that time, equalling 73-74% overall. The proportions of men with SV+ (4.1% from 3.4%) and LN+ (2.3% from 1.4%) increased relative to the preceding era for the first time since the Partin Tables were introduced in 1993.  Conclusions:   The Partin Tables remain a straightforward and accurate approach for projecting pathological outcomes based on readily available clinical data. Acknowledging these data are derived from a tertiary care referral centre, the proportion of men with OC disease has remained stable since 2000, despite a substantial decline in the proportion of men with biopsy Gleason score 6 (GG1). This is consistent with the notion that many men with Gleason score 6 (GG1) disease were over treated in previous eras.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Meera Chappidi', 'Zhaoyong Feng', 'Elizabeth B Humphreys', 'Misop Han', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Alan W Partin', 'Bruce J Trock']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Is there a role for pure clinical prediction models in prostate cancer in the contemporary era?', 'An updated prostate cancer staging nomogram (Partin tables) based on cases from 2006 to 2011.', 'Updated nomogram to predict pathologic stage of prostate cancer given prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score (Partin tables) based on cases from 2000 to 2005.', 'Prediction of patient-specific risk and percentile cohort risk of pathological stage outcome using continuous prostate-specific antigen measurement, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Prospective evaluation of men with stage T1C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Development and external validation of a multivariable 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET-based prediction model for lymph node involvement in men with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Extracapsular extension of transitional zone prostate cancer miss-detected by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Validation of user-friendly models predicting extracapsular extension in prostate cancer patients.', 'Selecting lymph node-positive patients for adjuvant therapy after radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy: An outcome analysis of 100 node-positive patients managed without adjuvant therapy.', 'A side-specific nomogram for extraprostatic extension may reduce the positive surgical margin rate in radical prostatectomy.']"""

HGPGU is a contraindication in most active surveillance (AS) and focal therapy protocols.  Patients and methods:   In all, 10 616 patients with localised prostate cancer were treated at a high-volume European tertiary care centre from 2010 to 2015 with radical prostatectomy. Analyses were restricted to 1 819 patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer (17.1%) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of <10.0 ng/mL, cT1c-cT2a and Gleason score ≤6, and were repeated within 772 of the men (7.3%) who fulfilled the PRIAS criteria for AS (PSA level of ≤10 ng/mL, T1c-T2, Gleason score ≤6, PSA density (PSAD) of <0.2 ng/mL2 , ≤2 positive cores). Uni- and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted, testing predictors of HGPGU. The final logistic regression model was based on the most informative variables.  Results:   There was HGPGU in 88 (4.8%) patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer and in 32 (4.1%) of the subgroup who were PRIAS eligible. Multivariable analysis predicting HGPGU for the patients with D'Amico low-risk yielded three independent predictors: age, PSAD, and clinical tumour stage (P = 0.008, P = 0.005 and P = 0.021, respectively). Within the same patients, the model using all vs the most informative variables resulted in area under the curves (AUCs) of 69.2% and 68.3%, respectively. Multivariable analysis of those who were PRIAS eligible, yielded age and number of positive cores as independent predictors of HGPGU (P = 0.002 and P = 0.049, respectively; AUC 64.9%).  Conclusions:   The low accuracy (invariably <70%) for HGPGU prediction in both patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer and PRIAS eligibility indicates that these variables have poor predictive ability in contemporary patients.

To escape anti-tumorigenic effects of IFNs, malignant cells attenuate JAK/STAT signaling and expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Such attenuation may enhance the susceptibility of tumor cells to oncolytic virotherapy. Here we studied genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of interference with JAK/STAT signaling and their contribution to susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to viral infection. Bioinformatics analysis of gene-expression in cohorts of prostate cancer patients revealed genetic and epigenetic interference with the IFN program. To correlate lack of IFN signaling and susceptibility to viral infection and oncolysis; we employed LNCaP prostate cancer cells as cellular model, and the human metapneumovirus and the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus as infectious agents. In LNCaP cells, JAK1 is silenced by bi-allelic inactivating mutations and epigenetic silencing, which also silences ISGs. Chemical inhibition of epigenetic silencing partially restored IFN-sensitivity, induced low levels of expression of selected ISGs and attenuated, but failed to block, viral infection and oncolysis. Since viral infection was not blocked by epigenetic modifiers, and these compounds may independently-induce anti-tumor effects, we propose that epigenetic modifiers and virotherapy are compatible in treatment of prostate tumors defective in JAK1 expression and IFN signaling.""","""['Oded Danziger', 'Ben Shai', 'Yosef Sabo', 'Eran Bacharach', 'Marcelo Ehrlich']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Interleukin-6 and Interferon-α Signaling via JAK1-STAT Differentially Regulate Oncolytic versus Cytoprotective Antiviral States.', 'Oncolytic targeting of androgen-sensitive prostate tumor by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): consequences of deficient interferon-dependent antiviral defense.', 'IFN unresponsiveness in LNCaP cells due to the lack of JAK1 gene expression.', 'Regulation of type I interferon signaling in immunity and inflammation: A comprehensive review.', 'Interferon-Mediated Tumor Resistance to Oncolytic Virotherapy.', 'Mapping of m6A and Its Regulatory Targets in Prostate Cancer Reveals a METTL3-Low Induction of Therapy Resistance.', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy: The Cancer Cell Side.', 'Tackling HLA Deficiencies Head on with Oncolytic Viruses.', 'RNA editing in cancer impacts mRNA abundance in immune response pathways.', 'Targeting the Immune system and Epigenetic Landscape of Urological Tumors.']"""

At the molecular level, ligand-mediated AR activation is coordinated through spatial and temporal protein-protein interactions involving AR-interacting proteins, which we designate the ""AR-interactome."" Despite many years of research, the ligand-sensitive protein complexes involved in ligand-mediated AR activation in prostate tumor cells have not been clearly defined. Here, we describe the development, characterization, and utilization of a novel human LNCaP prostate tumor cell line, N-AR, which stably expresses wild-type AR tagged at its N terminus with the streptavidin-binding peptide epitope (streptavidin-binding peptide-tagged wild-type androgen receptor; SBP-AR). A bioanalytical workflow involving streptavidin chromatography and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was used to identify SBP-AR and associated ligand-sensitive cytosolic proteins/protein complexes linked to AR activation in prostate tumor cells. Functional studies verified that ligand-sensitive proteins identified in the proteomic screen encoded modulators of AR-mediated transcription, suggesting that these novel proteins were putative SBP-AR-interacting proteins in N-AR cells. This was supported by biochemical associations between recombinant SBP-AR and the ligand-sensitive coatomer protein complex I (COPI) retrograde trafficking complex in vitro Extensive biochemical and molecular experiments showed that the COPI retrograde complex regulates ligand-mediated AR transcriptional activation, which correlated with the mobilization of the Golgi-localized ARA160 coactivator to the nuclear compartment of prostate tumor cells. Collectively, this study provides a bioanalytical strategy to validate the AR-interactome and define novel AR-interacting proteins involved in ligand-mediated AR activation in prostate tumor cells. Moreover, we describe a cellular system to study how compartment-specific AR-interacting proteins influence AR activation and contribute to aberrant AR-dependent transcription that underlies the majority of human prostate cancers.""","""['Jordy J Hsiao', 'Melinda M Smits', 'Brandon H Ng', 'Jinhee Lee', 'Michael E Wright']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Research Resource: Androgen Receptor Activity Is Regulated Through the Mobilization of Cell Surface Receptor Networks.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activate androgen receptor target genes and support aberrant prostate cancer cell growth independent of canonical androgen receptor nuclear localization signal.', 'Identification and characterization of androgen receptor associated coregulators in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-receptor-interacting nuclear proteins.', 'Discovery proteomics defines androgen-regulated glycoprotein networks in prostate cancer cells, as well as putative biomarkers of prostatic diseases.', 'Proteomic Landscape of Prostate Cancer: The View Provided by Quantitative Proteomics, Integrative Analyses, and Protein Interactomes.', 'Identification and Functional Characterization of a Novel Androgen Receptor Coregulator, EAP1.', 'Deubiquitinase USP7 contributes to the pathogenicity of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'BCOR-coupled H2A monoubiquitination represses a subset of androgen receptor target genes regulating prostate cancer proliferation.']"""

Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of TPGS on human periphral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) Jurkat clone E6-1 cells and its possible mechanism of action. PBL and Jurkat cells were treated with TPGS (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 μM), and morphological changes in the cell nucleus, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were determined by immune-fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Cellular apoptosis markers were also evaluated by immunocytochemistry. In this study, TPGS induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, but not in PBL, in a dose-response manner with increasing nuclear DNA fragmentation, increasing cell cycle arrest, and decreasing ΔΨm. Additionally, TPGS increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensity, indicative of H2O2 production, in a dose-independent fashion. TPGS increased DJ-1 Cys(106)-sulfonate, as a marker of intracellular stress and induced the activation of NF-κB, p53 and c-Jun transcription factors. Additionally, it increased the expression of apoptotic markers Bcl-2 related pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and PUMAand activated caspase-3. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and known pharmacological inhibitors protected the cells from the TPGS induced effects.

However, caudal displacement of implanted catheters does occur between fractions and needs to be corrected. Our protocol prescribes correction of displacements > 3 mm. We investigated whether displacement and its corrections influence acute and late toxicity incidences.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed 162 PCa patients treated with HDR-BT monotherapy between 2007 and 2013. The implant remained in situ between the 4 fractions. Catheter displacement was assessed before each fraction using lateral X-ray images and corrected if needed. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute and late toxicities were assessed using clinical record forms and patient self-assessment questionnaires.  Results:   Implant displacement corrections (DC) were needed in 71 patients (43.8%) whereas no DCs were needed in 91 patients (56.2%). No statistically significant differences were seen in acute and late grade ≥ 2 GU and GI toxicity incidences between DC and no DC groups. The maximum displacement nor the number of corrections had any influence on toxicity.  Conclusions:   The occurrence and subsequent correction of implant displacements exceeding 3 mm during fractionated HDR-BT monotherapy for PCa did not lead to increased incidences of acute or late GU and GI toxicity.

Until now it is unknown whether this information actually reaches the patients and how extensively an informational discussion about this topic is pursued by physicians.  Objective:   Three study hypotheses were defined: (1) the knowledge of PCA patients about the potential relationship between tumor progression and cigarette consumption is low, (2) only in rare cases has a clear statement been provided by treating physicians including the explicit advice to stop smoking, and (3) there was a direct association between tumor stage and the extent of cigarette consumption.  Materials and methods:   A questionnaire comprising 23 items was developed and validated with 25 uro-oncological patients prior to study start. Between September 2013 and December 2014 a total of 124 PCA patients (median age 65 years) from two urology departments were included in this questionnaire-based survey.  Results:   The study population comprised 43 % (n = 54), 39 % (n = 48), and 18 % (n = 22) nonsmokers, former smokers and active smokers, respectively. Active and former smokers differed insignificantly in the number of pack-years only (24.8 vs. 23.7 years, p = 0.995). Of the patients, 56 % regarded an influence of cigarette consumption on the PCA-specific prognosis as possible. However, because a significant (p < 0.001) number of patients wrongly suspected smoking to be causative for PCA development, their knowledge about PCA prognosis is supposedly not based on adequate knowledge. Two of 22 active smokers (9.1 %), 5 of 48 former smokers (10.4 %), and 2 of 54 nonsmokers (3.7 %) had an informational discussion with their urologist about the association of cigarette consumption and PCA-related prognosis (a further 9.1, 4.2 and 3.7 %, respectively, received this information solely from other medical specialties). Only 1 of 22 active smokers (4.5 %) was offered medical aids for smoking cessation by the general practitioner; none of the patients received such support by an urologist. There was no association between a positive smoking history or number of pack-years and PCA tumor stage.  Conclusions:   Education of PCA patients about the relationship between cigarette consumption and cancer-related prognosis is currently inadequate.

Materials and methods:   The IRB approved this retrospective study of 47 men who underwent 1.5 Tesla endorectal prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Informed consent was waived. Two readers identified and scored MRI lesions using PI-RADS V2. Their mean, median, 10th, 25th, 75th percentile ADC values, and normalized ratio were also calculated. Multilevel logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses assessed their diagnostic performance. Clinically significant PCa was defined as tumor volume over 0.5 cc and Gleason grade of 4 or 5 on prostatectomy.  Results:   The area under the ROC curve (A z) of the overall and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) PI-RADS V2 scores were 0.69 and 0.84 (reader-1), and 0.68 and 0.73 (reader-2). The A z of ADC parameters ranged from 0.68 to 0.75 for both readers. Compared to other predictors, DWI PI-RADS V2 yielded the highest A z for identification of significant cancer; but, except for reader-1 75th percentile ADC, the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Adding ADC parameters to PI-RADS V2 scores did not improve their diagnostic ability.  Conclusion:   DWI PI-RADS V2 score may a better predictor of clinically significant PCa than the overall PI-RADS V2 score, but its diagnostic performance was not significantly improved by the addition of objective ADC value measurements.""","""['W C Lin', 'A C Westphalen', 'G E Silva', 'S Chodraui Filho', 'R B Reis', 'V F Muglia']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Erratum to: Comparison of PI-RADS 2, ADC histogram-derived parameters, and their combination for the diagnosis of peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Effect of observation size and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in PI-RADS v2.1 assessment category 4 and 5 observations compared to adverse pathological outcomes.', 'PI-RADS v2 and ADC values: is there room for improvement?', 'Comparison of PI-RADS v1 and v2 for multiparametric MRI detection of prostate cancer with whole-mount histological workup as reference standard.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Variability of the Positive Predictive Value of PI-RADS for Prostate MRI across 26 Centers: Experience of the Society of Abdominal Radiology Prostate Cancer Disease-focused Panel.', 'A Transfer Learning Approach for Malignant Prostate Lesion Detection on Multiparametric MRI.', 'Detection of clinically signifi cant prostate cancer with PIRADS v2 scores, PSA density, and ADC values in regions with and without mpMRI visible lesions.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Interobserver Consistency of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2: A Study on Six Prostate Radiologists with Different Experiences from Half a Year to 17 Years.', 'Comparison of quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient parameters with prostate imaging reporting and data system V2 assessment for detection of clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, new methods for treating aggressive prostate cancer are under development. Because of the importance of androgen receptors (ARs) in the development of the hormone-refractory state and AR mechanism of action, this study was designed. A single-stranded DNA as an aptamer was designed that could mimic the hormone response element (HRE). The LNCaP cells as an AR-rich model were divided into three sets of triplicate groups: the test group was transfected with Aptamer Mimicking HRE (AMH), Mock received only transfection reagents (mock) and a negative control. All three sets received 0, 10 and 100 nM of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) separately. Data analysis showed hormone dependency of LNCaP cells in the negative control group upon treatment with 10 and 100 nM DHEA (compared with cells left untreated (P=0.001)). Transfection of AMH resulted in significant reduction of proliferation in the test group when compared with the negative control group with 10 (P=0.001) or 100 nM DHEA (P=0.02). AMH can form a hairpin structure at 37 °C and mimic the genomic HRE. Hence, it is capable of effectively competing with genomic HRE and interrupting the androgen signaling pathway in a prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP).""","""['S Kouhpayeh', 'A R Einizadeh', 'Z Hejazi', 'M Boshtam', 'L Shariati', 'M Mirian', 'L Darzi', 'M Sojoudi', 'H Khanahmad', 'A Rezaei']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Two androgen response elements in the androgen receptor coding region are required for cell-specific up-regulation of receptor messenger RNA.', 'MicroRNA-185 downregulates androgen receptor expression in the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Prostate cancer stromal cells and LNCaP cells coordinately activate the androgen receptor through synthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone.', 'Androgen-dependent regulation of Her-2/neu in prostate cancer cells.', 'Generation of HBsAg DNA aptamer using modified cell-based SELEX strategy.', 'Oligonucleotide aptamers: potential novel molecules against viral hepatitis.']"""

Objective:   Our aim was to investigate the prognostic value of absolute monocyte count (AMC), which is thought to modulate immune response in the tumor microenvironment, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with docetaxel chemotherapy.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 214 CRPC patients who received docetaxel therapy and were used as the training and validation set. Docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 was administered every 3 or 4 weeks. Clinicopathological factors and laboratory data were collected to assess the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   In the training set, the median age was 73.0 years, and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 31.7 ng/ml at initial treatment. The median OS and PFS were 23.0 months (range 1.20-84.0) and 11.2 months (range 3.6-78.0), respectively. According to multivariable Cox regression analysis, AMC ≥400/uL, PSA level ≥20 ng/ml, and Hb <10 mg/dL were associated with increased risk of PSA progression [hazard ratio (HR) 2.06, p = 0.005; HR 2.39, p = 0.002; and HR 2.38, p = 0.024, respectively]. Moreover, multivariate analysis for OS indicated that AMC ≥400/uL, pretreatment PSA level ≥20 ng/ml, presence of visceral metastasis, and alkaline phosphatase ≥284 U/L were independent prognostic factors for shortened OS (HR 2.07, p = 0.004; HR 2.18, p = 0.007; HR 2.11, p = 0.011; and HR 1.67, p = 0.048, respectively). According to the validation set, high AMC remained an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (HR 2.26, p = 0.001; and HR 3.10, p < 0.001, respectively).

Furthermore, rohitukine has never been studied for cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibition, kinase profiling and for its experimental physicochemical properties. Thus, herein, we report in vitro cytotoxicity of rohitukine in a panel of 20 cancer cell lines (including leukemia, pancreatic, prostate, breast and CNS) and 2 normal cell lines; kinase profiling, Cdk2/9 inhibition, and physicochemical properties (solubility and stability in biological medias, pKa, LogP, LogD). In cytotoxicity screening, rohitukine displayed promising activity in HL-60 and Molt-4 (leukemia) cell lines with GI50 of 10 and 12μM, respectively. It showed inhibition of Cdk2/A and Cdk9/T1 with IC50 values of 7.3 and 0.3μM, respectively. The key interactions of rohitukine with Cdk9 was also studied by molecular modeling. Rohitukine was found to be highly water soluble (Swater=10.3mg/mL) and its LogP value was -0.55. The ionization constant of rohitukine was found to be 5.83.

In this paper, we report on the construction of biocompatible polysaccharide nanoparticle with targeting ability and lower toxicity by supramolecular pKa shift strategy. This was realized through a ternary assembly constructed by the dual host‒guest interactions of an adamantane-bis(diamine) conjugate (ADA) with cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) and a polysaccharide. The potential application of such biocompatible nanostructure was further implemented by the selective transportation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a controlled manner. It is demonstrated that the strong encapsulation of the ADA's diammonium tail by CB[6] not only reduced the cytotoxicity of the nano-scaled vehicle but also dramatically enhanced cation density through an obvious positive macrocycle-induced pKa shift, which eventually facilitated the subsequent siRNA binding. With a targeted polysaccharide shell containing a cyclodextrin‒hyaluronic acid conjugate, macrocycle-incorporated siRNA polyplexes were specifically delivered into malignant human prostate PC-3 cells. The supramolecular polysaccharide nanoparticles, the formation of which was enabled and promoted by the complexation-assisted pKa shift, may be used as a versatile tool for controlled capture and release of biofunctional substrates.""","""['Ying-Ming Zhang', 'Yang Yang', 'Yu-Hui Zhang', 'Yu Liu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Tumor-specific delivery of siRNA using supramolecular assembly of hyaluronic acid nanoparticles and 2b RNA-binding protein/siRNA complexes.', 'Targeted polysaccharide nanoparticle for adamplatin prodrug delivery.', 'Systemic delivery of therapeutic small interfering RNA using a pH-triggered amphiphilic poly-L-lysine nanocarrier to suppress prostate cancer growth in mice.', 'Natural Polysaccharides for siRNA Delivery: Nanocarriers Based on Chitosan, Hyaluronic Acid, and Their Derivatives.', 'Recent Advances in siRNA Delivery Systems for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'An in situ protonation-activated supramolecular self-assembly for selective suppression of tumor growth.', 'Recent Advances in Supramolecular-Macrocycle-Based Nanomaterials in Cancer Treatment.', 'Host-guest complexes of imazalil with cucurbit8uril and β-cyclodextrin and their effect on plant pathogenic fungi.', 'An easy gene assembling strategy for light-promoted transfection by combining host-guest interaction of cucurbit7uril and gold nanoparticles.']"""

Peripheral blood samples were collected from 62 metastatic colorectal cancer patients and 30 metastatic prostate cancer patients. CTCs were isolated from the samples using magnetic separation with the cell-surface vimentin(CSV)-specific 84-1 monoclonal antibody that detects epithelial-mesenchymal transitioned (EMT) CTCs. CTCs were enumerated and analyzed for PD-L1 expression using confocal microscopy. PD-L1 expression was detectable in CTCs and was localized in the membrane and/or cytoplasm and nucleus. CTC detection alone was not associated with poor progression-free or overall survival in colorectal cancer or prostate cancer patients, but nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1) expression in these patients was significantly associated with short survival durations. These results demonstrated that nPD-L1 has potential as a clinically relevant prognostic biomarker for colorectal and prostate cancer.

DNAH8 is on chromosome 6q21.2, a cancer-associated amplicon, and is primarily expressed in prostate and testis. Its expression is higher in primary tumors compared to normal prostate, and is further increased in metastatic prostate cancers. Patients expressing high levels of DNAH8 have a greater risk of relapse and a poor prognosis after prostatectomy. Depletion of DNAH8 in prostate cancer cells suppressed AR transcriptional activity and proliferation. Androgen treatment increased DNAH8 mRNA expression, and AR bound the DNAH8 promoter sequence indicating DNAH8 is an AR target gene.

The activity of 15-LOX-1 and the inhibitory effects of 8f on this enzyme were first assessed in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. The MTT assay was used to examine the cytotoxicity effects of 8f on PC-3 cells following 15-LOX-1 inhibition. To determine the type of cell death, chromatin condensation and DNA damage were examined by DAPI staining and comet assay, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of 8f on the cell cycle were evaluated by PI staining and flow cytometry. The activity of 15-LOX-1 was determined to be higher in PC-3 compared with DU145 cells; thus, this cell line was selected for further experiments. 8f induced cell death in PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, with IC50 values similar to cisplatin, which was used as a control. However, 8f did not significantly affect the viability of HFF3, human foreskin fibroblast cells, under identical conditions. The appearance of apoptotic cells after 8f treatment was confirmed by the presence of PC-3 cells containing condensed chromatin as shown by DAPI staining. The comet assay indicated the induction of DNA damage in cancerous cells compared with normal cells. In addition, 8f induced a potent G1 cell-cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. Our results showed that the antitumor effects of 8f on PC-3 cells were promoted by apoptosis induction, probably via inhibition of 15-LOX-1 activity, thus suggesting that 8f may have therapeutic value in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Minoo Hosseinymehr', 'Maryam M Matin', 'Hamid Sadeghian', 'Ahmad Reza Bahrami', 'Nasrin Kaseb-Mojaver']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Stylosin and some of its synthetic derivatives induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors.', '7-Farnesyloxycoumarin Exerts Anti-cancer Effects on a Prostate Cancer Cell Line by 15-LOX-1 Inhibition.', 'Expression of lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer and growth reduction by its inhibitors.', 'Investigating the Anti-tumor and Apoptosis-inducing Effects of Coumarin Derivatives as Potent 15-Lipoxygenase Inhibitors on PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The importance of 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors in cancer treatment.', 'Identification of Novel Arachidonic Acid 15-Lipoxygenase Inhibitors Based on the Bayesian Classifier Model and Computer-Aided High-Throughput Virtual Screening.', 'Investigating the effects of two novel 4-MMPB analogs as potent lipoxygenase inhibitors for prostate cancer treatment.', 'An Overview of Coumarin as a Versatile and Readily Accessible Scaffold with Broad-Ranging Biological Activities.', 'Stylosin and some of its synthetic derivatives induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors.']"""

Matherial and method:   A total of 702 consecutive pathology slides with a diagnosis of prostatic hyperplasia between 2009 to 2014 in specimens were obtained by prostatectomy or trans- urethral resection of the prostate. Those slides were submitted to Faghihi hospital, affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, and were reviewed retrospectively in order to search the findings in favor of STUMP.  Results:   Based on histological findings, STUMP was identified in 3 cases (0.43%), which revealed hypercellular stroma, infiltrating between the hyperplastic glands. Cells showed some degree of pleomorphism, nuclei with vesicular chromatin and few mitotic figures. No recurrence was reported in patients.  Conclusion:   Although STUMP can be histologically and clinically misdiagnosed as BPH, the differences in prognosis and treatment modalities highlight the importance of rendering the correct diagnosis.""","""['Maral Mokhtari', 'Maryam Homayoun', 'Shahrzad Yazdan Panah']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arch Iran Med""","""['Incidental prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP): histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.', 'Specialized stromal tumors of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 50 cases.', 'Round cell pattern of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential: a subtle newly recognized variant.', 'A case report of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP).', 'Sarcomas and related proliferative lesions of specialized prostatic stroma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.', 'Prostatic stromal sarcoma: Report of a rare case in a young male and review of the literature.', 'Prostate stromal tumor with prostatic cysts after transurethral resection of the prostate: A case report.', 'Altered staining patterns and expression level of Engrailed-2 in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate Cancer predict prostatic disease progression.']"""

Toluidine blue, by its property of retaining in the increased DNA and RNA cellular activity areas, aids in delineating the suspicious areas. However, it is hazardous if swallowed, and has been shown to have toxicity to fibroblasts. Methylene blue has a similar chemical structure and exhibits similar physicochemical properties as toluidine blue. It is less toxic to the human body and has recently been proposed for screening some gastrointestinal or prostate tumors. The application of this material in detecting oral lesions has so far not been addressed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of in vivo staining with methylene blue as a diagnostic adjunct in screening for oral malignant or potentially malignant lesions.  Methods:   The present study involved the examination of 75 patients suspected of having oral malignant or potentially malignant lesions by methylene blue staining. The results of methylene blue uptake were compared with a simultaneous biopsy of these lesions.  Results:   The overall sensitivity was 95% (100% for malignancy and 92% for potentially malignant lesions) and specificity was 70%.

We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations could distinguish prostate tumors with life-threatening potential.  Experimental design:   Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in surgically resected primary tumor tissues from a population-based (n = 430) and a replication (n = 80) cohort of prostate cancer patients followed prospectively for at least 5 years. Metastasis was confirmed by positive bone scan, MRI, CT, or biopsy, and death certificates confirmed cause of death. AUC, partial AUC (pAUC, 95% specificity), and P value criteria were used to select differentially methylated CpG sites that robustly stratify patients with metastatic-lethal from nonrecurrent tumors, and which were complementary to Gleason sum.  Results:   Forty-two CpG biomarkers stratified patients with metastatic-lethal versus nonrecurrent prostate cancer in the discovery cohort, and eight of these CpGs replicated in the validation cohort based on a significant (P < 0.05) AUC (range, 0.66-0.75) or pAUC (range, 0.007-0.009). The biomarkers that improved discrimination of patients with metastatic-lethal prostate cancer include CpGs in five genes (ALKBH5, ATP11A, FHAD1, KLHL8, and PI15) and three intergenic regions. In the validation dataset, the AUC for Gleason sum alone (0.82) significantly increased with the addition of four individual CpGs (range, 0.86-0.89; all P <0.05).  Conclusions:   Eight differentially methylated CpGs that distinguish patients with metastatic-lethal from nonrecurrent tumors were validated.

However, prostate cancer cells in advanced stages become resistant to inhibitory effects of TGF-β. The intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in differential effects of TGF-β during different stages are largely unknown. Using cell line models, we have shown that TGF-β inhibits proliferation in normal (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer (DU145) cells but does not have any effect on proliferation of prostate cancer (PC3) cells. We have investigated the role of Jun family proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) in TGF-β effects on cell proliferation. Jun family members were expressed at different levels and responded differentially to TGF-β treatment. TGF-β effects on JunD protein levels, but not mRNA levels, correlated with its effects on cell proliferation. TGF-β induced significant reduction in JunD protein in RWPE-1 and DU145 cells but not in PC3 cells. Selective knockdown of JunD expression using siRNA in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in significant reduction in cell proliferation, and forced overexpression of JunD increased the proliferation rate. On the other hand, knockdown of c-Jun or JunB had little, if any, effect on cell proliferation; overexpression of c-Jun and JunB decreased the proliferation rate in DU145 cells. Further studies showed that down-regulation of JunD in response to TGF-β treatment is mediated via the proteasomal degradation pathway. In conclusion, we show that specific Jun family members exert differential effects on proliferation in prostate cancer cells in response to TGF-β, and inhibition of cell proliferation by TGF-β requires degradation of JunD protein.""","""['Ana Cecilia Millena', 'BaoHan T Vo', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Alterations in TGFβ signaling during prostate cancer progression.', 'TGF-β Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'Differential role of PTEN in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and beta 3 as well as c-fos mRNA in normal human prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer.', 'Multiple facets of junD gene expression are atypical among AP-1 family members.', 'JUND Promotes Tumorigenesis via Specifically Binding on Enhancers of Multiple Oncogenes in Cervical Cancer.', 'Menin-MLL1 Interaction Small Molecule Inhibitors: A Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Leukemia and Cancers.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'Targeting AP-1 transcription factors by CRISPR in the prostate.', 'Alterations in TGFβ signaling during prostate cancer progression.']"""

However, conditions for unbiased estimation are poorly understood. We developed a mathematical framework to project the effects of screening on the incidence of relevant cancers-that is, cancers that would present clinically without screening. Screening advances the date of diagnosis for a fraction of preclinical relevant cancers. Which diagnoses are advanced and by how much depends on the preclinical detectable period, test sensitivity, and screening patterns. Using the model, we projected incidence in common trial designs and population settings and compared excess incidence with true overdiagnosis. In trials with no control arm screening, unbiased estimates are available using cumulative incidence if the screen arm stops screening and using annual incidence if the screen arm continues screening. In both designs, unbiased estimation requires waiting until screening stabilizes plus the maximum preclinical period. In continued-screen trials and population settings, excess cumulative incidence is persistently biased. We investigated this bias in published estimates from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer after 9-13 years.

However, the mechanism underlying the effects of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 in the pathogensis of PCa. In the present study, a microarray containing 8,277 lncRNA probes and 32,207 mRNA probes were used to identify dysregulated mRNAs in three patients with PCa, and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression levels of thrombospondin 4 (THBS4) and lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 in 46 primary PCa and adjacent non‑tumor tissue samples. The expression levels of THBS4 were determined in six samples of PCa and adjacent non‑tumor tissues using Western blot analysis. The effects of forced THBS4 knockdown and lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 knockdown in the two PCa cell lines, DU145 and PC‑3, were evaluated using cell migration and invasion assays, as well as using Western blot analysis. Of the 40,484 probes in the microarray, 354 were significantly upregulated (P<0.05; fold‑change >2). The most significantly upregulated mRNA was THBS4. The expression levels of THBS4 and lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 in the 46 primary PCa samples was significantly higher, compared with that in the adjacent non‑tumor tissue samples. Patients with Gleason scores >7 exhibited higher expression levels of lncRNA‑THBS4‑003, compared with patients with lower scores. Knockdown of THBS4 or lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 significantly reduced the migratory and invasive abilities of the PCa cells in vitro, and decreased the expression levels of p38 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9. These findings suggested that the reciprocal regulation of lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 and THBS4 contributed to the pathogenesis of PCa. Therefore silencing lncRNA‑THBS4‑003 or THBS4 may inhibit PCa cell migration and invasion, and regulate the levels of MMP‑9 through the mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling pathway.""","""['Jinliang Liu', 'Gong Cheng', 'Haiwei Yang', 'Xiaheng Deng', 'Chao Qin', 'Lixin Hua', 'Changjun Yin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['THBS4 silencing regulates the cancer stem cell-like properties in prostate cancer via blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'miR-152 controls migration and invasive potential by targeting TGFα in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Long noncoding RNA TUG1 regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration via the Nrf2 signaling axis.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in prostate cancer: An update.', 'Extracellular matrix-based gene signature for predicting prognosis in colon cancer and immune microenvironment.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening key miRNAs and genes in prostate cancer by microarray analysis.', 'DNA Methylation in INA, NHLH2, and THBS4 Is Associated with Metastatic Disease in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Does the Urinary Proteome Reflect ccRCC Stage and Grade Progression?']"""

Of the three predictor variables, acceptance and positive reinterpretation were most strongly related to benefit finding.  Conclusion:   The self-reported coping strategies 'acceptance' and 'positive reframing' emerged as being most significantly predictive of benefit finding in this sample. 'Turning to religion' was also significant, but to a somewhat lesser extent in predicting benefit finding in the disruptive experience of prostate cancer.  Relevance to clinical practice:   The use of positively oriented emotional coping strategies of 'acceptance', 'positive reframing' and 'turning to religion' are influential to benefit finding in prostate cancer. An understanding of the coping strategies that are predictive to benefit finding can assist clinicians to discern and target men who are more or less likely to find benefit, and to develop person-centred support strategies and interventions with an aim to optimising positive emotional states throughout the cancer journey.""","""['Elizabeth C Pascoe', 'David Edvardsson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['Psychological Characteristics and Traits for Finding Benefit From Prostate Cancer: Correlates and Predictors.', 'A longitudinal study of coping strategies in men receiving radiotherapy and neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: a quantitative and qualitative study.', 'The relationship between anxiety, coping strategies and characteristics of patients with diabetes.', 'Coping with prostate cancer: a meta-analytic review.', 'Exploring the relationship between coping, social support and health-related quality of life for prostate cancer survivors: a review of the literature.', 'Coping strategies in active and inactive men with prostate cancer: a qualitative study.', 'Benefit finding in long-term prostate cancer survivors.', 'Coping and adjustment in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review of qualitative studies.']"""

The androgen receptor gene codes for a protein that has an androgen‑binding domain, DNA‑binding domain and N‑terminal domain, which contains two polymorphic trinucleotide repeats (CAG and GGC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether variations in the number of repetitions of CAG and GGC are associated with the pathological features and the risk of developing PC. The polymorphic CAG and GGC repeat lengths in 108 mestizo patients with PC, 148 healthy mestizo individuals, and 78 healthy indigenous individuals were examined via a retrospective case‑control study. Genotypes were determined by genomic sequencing. The results demonstrated that patients with ≤21 CAG repeats have an increased risk of developing PC [odds ratio (OR)=2.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.79‑5.01; P<0.001]. The presence of ≤21 CAG repeats was also associated with a tumor stage ≥T2c (OR=4.75; 95% CI=1.77‑12.72; P<0.005) and a Gleason score ≥7 (OR=2.9; 95% CI=1.1‑7.66; P=0.03).

Understanding the genetic regulation of this enzyme is important because PAP plays an important role in prostate cancer and is expressed in other tissues such as the brain.  Methods:   We tested association between 5.8 M SNPs and PAP levels in cerebrospinal fluid across 543 individuals in two datasets using linear regression.

The data, however, have been generated in controlled research settings and might not be transferable to daily clinical practice. This article describes the design of an ongoing prospective observational study to evaluate the potential benefits of exercise in daily clinical practice.  Methods and analysis:   Men diagnosed with prostate cancer starting or already receiving ADT at our facility are invited to participate in a 12-week exercise programme implemented as the standard of care. Exclusion criteria are opioid-demanding treatment for skeletal pain, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status above 2 or the inability to perform floor and machine exercises independently. The intervention consists of an initial educational session of 1½ hours followed by 12 weeks of group-based supervised training two times a week. The focus of the exercise is progressive resistance training in combination with aerobic training. Participants are measured at baseline, after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks as part of the programme. Primary endpoints of this study are changes in physical fitness evaluated by the 30 s Chair-Stand Test and Graded Cycling Test with Talk Test. Secondary endpoints include changes in quality of life, body composition and safety of exercise. Inclusion started in August 2014, with 169 participants being included by December 2015.

However, the mechanisms on aberrant elevation of ARF in cancers are still poorly understood. We previously showed that ARF (p14ARF in human and p19Arf in mouse) elevation correlates with PTEN loss and stabilizes SLUG to reduce cell adhesion in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report that ARF is essential for MMP7 expression, E-Cadherin decrease and the anchorage loss to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that Mmp7 is aberrantly elevated in cytosol and nucleus of malignant prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Interestingly, p19Arf deficiency strikingly decreases Mmp7 levels but increases E-Cadherin in Pten/Trp53/p19Arf mice. ARF knockdown markedly reduces MMP7 in human PCa cells. Conversely, tetracycline-inducible expression of ARF increases MMP7 with a decrease of E-Cadherin in PCa cells. Importantly, MMP7 physically binds ARF to show the co-localization in nucleus. Co-expression of MMP7 and ARF promotes cell migration, and MMP7 knockdown decreases wound healing in PCa cells. Furthermore, MMP7 elevation correlates with ARF expression in advanced human PCa. Our findings reveal for the first time that the crosstalk between ARF and MMP7 in nucleus contributes to ECM network in tumor microenvironments in vivo, implicating a novel therapeutic target for advanced PCa treatment.""","""['Yingqiu Xie', 'Wenfu Lu', 'Shenji Liu', 'Qing Yang', 'J Shawn Goodwin', 'Sandeep Anantha Sathyanarayana', 'Siddharth Pratap', 'Zhenbang Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['ARF represses androgen receptor transactivation in prostate cancer.', 'Slug regulates E-cadherin repression via p19Arf in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Interleukin-17 promotes prostate cancer via MMP7-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Regulatory Network of ARF in Cancer Development.', 'The ARF tumour suppressor.', 'Human Papillomavirus Modulates Matrix Metalloproteinases During Carcinogenesis: Clinical Significance and Role of Viral Oncoproteins.', 'Inhibition of lncRNA RET enhances radio-sensitivity of tumor cells via miR-3179/Slug/PTEN axis.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) are localized in the nucleus of retinal Müller glial cells and modulated by cytokines and oxidative stress.', 'Mechanisms of TP53 Pathway Inactivation in Embryonic and Somatic Cells-Relevance for Understanding (Germ Cell) Tumorigenesis.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.']"""

In this prospective study of Chilean men with a continued suspicion of prostate cancer due to a persistently elevated total serum PSA, abnormal digital rectal examination and initial negative prostate biopsy were compared with the use of the on-line Chun nomagram, detection of primary malignant circulating prostate cells (CPCs) and free percent PSA to predict a positive second prostate biopsy. We hypothesized that men negative for circulating prostate cells have a small risk of clinically significant prostate cancer and thus may be conservatively observed. Men positive for circulating prostate cells should undergo biopsy to confirm prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Consecutive men with a continued suspicion of prostate cancer underwent 12 core TRUS prostate biopsy; age, total serum PSA and percentage free PSA and Chun nomagram scores were registered. Immediately before biopsy an 8ml blood simple was taken to detect primary mCPCs. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation and identified using double immunostaining with anti-PSA and anti-P504S. Biopsies were classifed as cancer/no-cancer, mCPC detecton test as negative/positive and the total number of cells/8ml registered. Areas under the curve (AUC) for percentage free PSA, Chun score and CPCs were calculated and compared. Diagnostic yields were calculated with reference to the number of possible biopsies that could be avoided and the number of clinically significant cancers that would be missed.  Results:   A total of 164 men underwent a second biopsy; 41 (25%) had cancer; the AUCs were 0.65 for free PSA, 0.76 for the Chun score and 0.87 for CPC detection, the last having a significantly superior prediction value (p=0.01). Using cut off values of free PSA <10%, Chun score >50% and ≥1 CPC detected, CPC detection had a higher diagnostic yield. Some 4/41 cancers complied with the criteria for active surveillance, free PSA and the Chun score missed a higher number of significant cancers when compared with CPC detection.

However, toxicities associated with their pleiotropic effects could contribute to the ineffectiveness of HDACIs in PCa treatment. We designed hybrid molecules containing partial chemical scaffolds of enzalutamide and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), with weakened intrinsic pan-HDACI activities, to target HSP90 and AR in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. The potency of the new molecules, compounds 2-75 [4-(3-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-fluoro-N-(7-(hydroxyamino)-7-oxoheptyl)benzamide] and 1005 [(E)-3-(4-(3-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-fluorophenyl)-N-hydroxyacrylamide], as inhibitors of nuclear and cytosolic histone deacetylases was substantially lower than that of SAHA in cell-free and in situ assays. Compounds 2-75 and 1005 antagonized gene activation by androgen without inducing chromatin association of AR. Enzalutamide had no effect on the levels of AR or HSP90, whereas the hybrid compounds induced degradation of both AR and HSP90, similar to (compound 1005) or more potently than (compound 2-75) SAHA. Similar to SAHA, compounds 2-75 and 1005 decreased the level of HSP90 and induced acetylation in a predicted approximately 55 kDa HSP90 fragment. Compared with SAHA, compound 2-75 induced greater hyperacetylation of the HDAC6 substrate α-tubulin. In contrast with SAHA, neither hybrid molecule caused substantial hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4. Compounds 2-75 and 1005 induced p21 and caused loss of viability in the enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 cells, with efficacies that were comparable to or better than SAHA.

Patients and methods:   A prospective single-center study of men who underwent radical prostatectomy as monotherapy for prostate cancer. Clinical-pathological findings were used to calculate the CAPRA score. Before surgery blood was taken for CPC detection, mononuclear cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation, and CPCs identified using immunocytochemistry. A CPC was defined as a cell expressing prostate-specific antigen and P504S, and the presence or absence of CPCs and the number of cells detected/8ml blood sample was registered. Patients were followed up for up to 5 years; biochemical failure was defined as a prostate-specific antigen>0.2ng/ml. The validity of the CAPRA score was calibrated using partial validation, and the fractional polynomial Cox proportional hazard regression was used to build 3 models, which underwent a decision analysis curve to determine the predictive value of the 3 models with respect to biochemical failure.  Results:   A total of 267 men participated, mean age 65.80 years, and after 5 years of follow-up the biochemical-free survival was 67.42%. The model using CAPRA score showed a hazards ratio (HR) of 5.76 between low and high-risk groups, that of CPC with a HR of 26.84 between positive and negative groups, and the combined model showed a HR of 4.16 for CAPRA score and 19.93 for CPC. Using the continuous variable nCPC, there was no improvement in the predictive value of the model compared with the model using a positive-negative result of CPC detection. The combined CAPRA-nCPC model showed an improvement of the predictive performance for biochemical failure using the Harrell׳s C concordance test and a net benefit on DCA in comparison with either model used separately. The use of primary CPC as a predictive factor based on their presence or absence did not predict aggressive disease or biochemical failure.  Conclusion:   Although the use of a combined CAPRA-nCPC model improves the prediction of biochemical failure in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, this is minimal. The use of the presence or absence of primary CPCs alone did not predict aggressive disease or biochemical failure.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Socrates Aedo', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Omar Jacob', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Camilo Novoa', 'Sebastian Orellana', 'Nelson Orellana']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Combining the Prostate Cancer Risk Index (PRIX) with the Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells to Predict the Risk of Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', '10 Year Biochemical Failure Free Survival of Men with CD82 Positive Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prediction model for early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy based on the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and the presence of secondary circulating prostate cells.', 'Prognostic value of the CAPRA clinical prediction rule: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The presence of secondary circulating prostate tumour cells determines the risk of biochemical relapse for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who are treated only with external radiotherapy.', 'Predictive Value of Circulating Tumor Cells Detected by ISET® in Patients with Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Application of Primary/Secondary Circulating Tumor Cells for the Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence in Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Patients following Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Combining the Prostate Cancer Risk Index (PRIX) with the Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells to Predict the Risk of Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', '10 Year Biochemical Failure Free Survival of Men with CD82 Positive Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The presence of primary circulating prostate cells is associated with upgrading and upstaging in patients eligible for active surveillance.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients randomized to the radiation-alone arms (without hormone therapy) of the 2 trials were evaluated, including 104 men receiving primary prostate radiation to 68.4Gy on RTOG 94-08 and 371 men receiving 64.8Gy to the prostatic fossa on RTOG 96-01. Acute and late urinary toxicity were scored prospectively by RTOG scales. Chi-square test/logistic regression and cumulative incidence approach/Fine-Gray regression model were used for analyses of acute and late toxicity, respectively.  Results:   Grade≥2 acute urinary toxicity was significantly higher after primary prostatic radiation compared with postprostatectomy radiation (30.8% vs. 14.0%; P<0.001), but acute grade≥3 toxicity did not differ (3.8% vs. 2.7%; P = 0.54). After adjusting for age, primary radiation resulted in significantly higher grade≥2 acute urinary toxicity (odds ratio = 3.72; 95% CI: 1.65-8.37; P = 0.02). With median follow-up of 7.1 years, late urinary toxicity was not significantly different with primary vs. postprostatectomy radiation (5-year grade≥2: 16.7% vs. 18.3%; P = 0.65; grade≥3: 6.0% vs. 3.3%; P = 0.24).

In this area, scalable lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices have many advantages over standard laboratory methods, including faster analysis, reduced cost, lower power consumption, and higher levels of integration and automation. Despite significant advances in LOC technologies over the years, several remaining obstacles are preventing clinical implementation and market penetration of these novel medical microdevices. Similarly, while machine learning has seen explosive growth in recent years and promises to shift the practice of medicine toward data-intensive and evidence-based decision making, its uptake has been hindered due to the lack of integration between clinical measurements and disease determinations. In this Account, we describe recent developments in the programmable bio-nanochip (p-BNC) system, a biosensor platform with the capacity for learning. The p-BNC is a ""platform to digitize biology"" in which small quantities of patient sample generate immunofluorescent signal on agarose bead sensors that is optically extracted and converted to antigen concentrations. The platform comprises disposable microfluidic cartridges, a portable analyzer, automated data analysis software, and intuitive mobile health interfaces. The single-use cartridges are fully integrated, self-contained microfluidic devices containing aqueous buffers conveniently embedded for POC use. A novel fluid delivery method was developed to provide accurate and repeatable flow rates via actuation of the cartridge's blister packs. A portable analyzer instrument was designed to integrate fluid delivery, optical detection, image analysis, and user interface, representing a universal system for acquiring, processing, and managing clinical data while overcoming many of the challenges facing the widespread clinical adoption of LOC technologies. We demonstrate the p-BNC's flexibility through the completion of multiplex assays within the single-use disposable cartridges for three clinical applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction. Toward the goal of creating ""sensors that learn"", we have developed and describe here the Cardiac ScoreCard, a clinical decision support system for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The Cardiac ScoreCard approach comprises a comprehensive biomarker panel and risk factor information in a predictive model capable of assessing early risk and late-stage disease progression for heart attack and heart failure patients. These marker-driven tests have the potential to radically reduce costs, decrease wait times, and introduce new options for patients needing regular health monitoring. Further, these efforts demonstrate the clinical utility of fusing data from information-rich biomarkers and the Internet of Things (IoT) using predictive analytics to generate single-index assessments for wellness/illness status. By promoting disease prevention and personalized wellness management, tools of this nature have the potential to improve health care exponentially.""","""['Michael P McRae', 'Glennon Simmons', 'Jorge Wong', 'John T McDevitt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acc Chem Res""","""['Programmable bio-nano-chip system: a flexible point-of-care platform for bioscience and clinical measurements.', 'Programmable bio-nanochip technology for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at the point-of-care.', 'Lab-on-a-Disc for Point-of-Care Infection Diagnostics.', 'A multiplexable, microfluidic platform for the rapid quantitation of a biomarker panel for early ovarian cancer detection at the point-of-care.', 'Cardiovascular disease detection using bio-sensing techniques.', 'Microsystem Advances through Integration with Artificial Intelligence.', 'Emerging applications of nanotechnology in context to immunology: A comprehensive review.', 'Merging microfluidics with luminescence immunoassays for urgent point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19.', 'Smart Diagnostics: Combining Artificial Intelligence and In Vitro Diagnostics.', 'A Rapid and Sensitive Microfluidics-Based Tool for Seroprevalence Immunity Assessment of COVID-19 and Vaccination-Induced Humoral Antibody Response at the Point of Care.']"""

We investigated whether combination of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells adoptive immunotherapy and CCL21/IL15 armed oncolytic adenovirus could induce the enhanced antitumor activity. The CCL21/IL15 co-expression oncolytic adenoviruses were constructed by using the AdEasy system, which uses homologous recombination with shuttle plasmids and full length Ad backbones. This conditionally replicating adenoviruses CRAd-CCL21-IL15 could induce apoptosis in TERTp-positive tumor cells for viral propagation, but do not replicate efficiently in normal cells, because the E1A promoter was replaced by telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERTp).

Methods:   We characterized vessel morphology (area and irregularity) among 511 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer during 1986 to 2000, re-reviewed Gleason grade, and followed men through 2012. Men were grouped according to integrated vessel lumen irregularity and vessel area across Gleason grade. The more angiogenic group was identified as those with more irregular vessel lumen and smaller vessel area. Crude rates (95 % confidence intervals) and survival probability were estimated across Gleason grade and vessel morphology.  Results:   During a median 14-year follow-up, 62 men developed bone metastases or died of prostate cancer. Lethality rates were uniformly low within Gleason grade categories 6 and 7(3 + 4), regardless of vessel morphology. However, among men with Gleason grades of 7(4 + 3) or 8-10, the more angiogenic group was associated with fourfold higher risk of lethal outcomes compared to those with less angiogenic potential. Ten-year survival probability ranged from 95 to 74 % according to the extent of vessel morphology (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).

This division of GS 7, essentially determined by the percent of Gleason pattern (GP) 4 (< or >50%), raises the question of whether a more exact quantification of the percent GP 4 within GS 7 will yield additional prognostic information. Modifications were also made by ISUP regarding the definition of GP 4, now including 4 main architectural types: cribriform, glomeruloid, poorly formed, and fused glands. This study was conducted to analyze the prognostic significance of the percent GP 4 and main architectural types of GP 4 according to the 2014 ISUP grading criteria in radical prostatectomies (RPs). The cohort included 585 RP cases of GS 6 (40.2%), 3+4 (49.0%), and 4+3 (10.8%) prostate cancers. Significantly different 5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were observed among GS 6 (99%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 97%-100%), 3+4 (81%, 95% CI: 76%-86%), and 4+3 (60%, 95% CI: 45%-71%) cancers (P<0.01). Dividing the GP 4 percent into quartiles showed a 5-year BCR-free survival of 84% (95% CI: 78%-89%) for 1% to 20%, 74% (95% CI: 62%-83%) for 21% to 50%, 66% (95% CI: 50%-78%) for 51% to 70%, and 32% (95% CI: 9%-59%) for >70% (P<0.001). Among the GP 4 architectures, cribriform was the most prevalent (43.7%), and combination of architectures with cribriform present was more frequently observed in GS 4+3 (60.3%). Glomeruloid was mostly (67.1%) seen combined with other GP 4 architectures. Unlike the other GP 4 architectures, glomeruloid as the sole GP 4 was observed only as a secondary pattern (ie, 3+4). Among patients with GS 7 cancer, the presence of cribriform architecture was associated with decreased 5-year BCR-free survival when compared with GS 7 cancers without this architecture (68% vs. 85%, P<0.01), whereas the presence of glomeruloid architecture was associated with improved 5-year BCR-free survival when compared with GS 7 cancers without this architecture (87% vs. 75%, P=0.01). However, GS 7 disease having only the glomeruloid architecture had significantly lower 5-year BCR-free survival than GS 6 cancers (86% vs. 99%, P<0.01). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model for factors associated with BCR among GS 7 cancers identified age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, P<0.01), preoperative prostate-specific antigen (HR 1.07, P<0.01), positive surgical margin (HR 2.70, P<0.01), percent of GP 4 (21% to 50% [HR 2.21], 51% to 70% [HR 2.59], >70% [HR 6.57], all P<0.01), presence of cribriform glands (HR 1.78, P=0.02), and presence of glomeruloid glands (HR 0.43, P=0.03) as independent predictors. In conclusion, our study shows that increments in percent of GP 4 correlate with increased risk for BCR supporting the ISUP recommendation of recording the percent of GP 4 in GS 7 prostate cancers at RP. However, additional larger studies are needed to establish the optimal interval for reporting percent GP 4 in GS 7 cancers. Among the GP 4 architectures, cribriform independently predicts BCR, whereas glomeruloid reduces the risk of BCR. Distinction should be made between cribriform and glomeruloid architectures, despite glomeruloid being considered as an early stage of cribriform, as cribriform confers a higher risk for poorer outcome.""","""['Bonnie Choy', 'Shane M Pearce', 'Blake B Anderson', 'Arieh L Shalhav', 'Gregory Zagaja', 'Scott E Eggener', 'Gladell P Paner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Re: Prognostic Significance of Percentage and Architectural Types of Contemporary Gleason Pattern 4 Prostate Cancer in Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Predictive value of the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology grading system for prostate cancer in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with long-term follow-up.', 'The impact of the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology consensus guidelines on Gleason grading - a matched-pair analysis.', 'Prognostic impact of intraductal carcinoma and large cribriform carcinoma architecture after prostatectomy in a contemporary cohort.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'From Gleason to International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Heterogeneity of contemporary grade group 4 prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic factors in Japanese men with high-Gleason metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey data were used to identify men who were 65 years old or older and were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2009. The primary outcome was treatment choice: conservative management, surgery, or radiation within 1 year of the diagnosis. The exposure was the functional status assessed as 4 measures within 3 domains: 1) physical function (activities of daily living [ADLs] and physical component summary score), 2) cognitive function (survey completer: self vs proxy), and 3) emotional well-being (mental component summary score). A multivariate, multinomial logistic regression was fitted with adjustments for several patient, tumor, and regional characteristics.  Results:   This study identified 508 conservative management patients, 195 surgery patients, and 603 radiation patients. Compared with men with no ADL dependency, those with any ADL dependency had lower odds of receiving surgery (odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.99) or radiation (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) versus conservative management. ADL dependency did not differ when surgery and radiation were compared. Patients with a proxy survey response were less likely to receive surgery or radiation versus conservative management.  Conclusions:   Functional status is associated with treatment choice for men with prostate cancer. Future research should examine whether this is due to physician recommendations, patient preferences, or a combination.

Additionally, activation of the AR is required for survival of benign luminal epithelial cells and primary cancer cells, thus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to apoptosis in both benign and cancerous tissue. Escape from ADT is known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the course of CRPC development the AR typically switches from being a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of normal prostate epithelial cell proliferation to becoming an oncogene that is critical for prostate cancer cell proliferation. A clearer understanding of the context dependent activation of the AR and its target genes is therefore desirable.  Methods:   Immortalized human prostate basal epithelial EP156T cells and progeny cells that underwent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), primary prostate epithelial cells (PrECs) and prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, VCaP and 22Rv1 were used to examine context dependent restriction and activation of the AR and classical target genes, such as KLK3. Genome-wide gene expression analyses and single cell protein analyses were applied to study the effect of different contexts.  Results:   A variety of growth conditions were tested and found unable to activate AR expression and transcription of classical androgen-dependent AR target genes, such as KLK3, in prostate epithelial cells with basal cell features or in mesenchymal type prostate cells. The restriction of androgen- and AR-dependent transcription of classical target genes in prostate basal epithelial cells was at the level of AR expression. Exogenous AR expression was sufficient for androgen-dependent transcription of AR target genes in prostate basal epithelial cells, but did not exert a positive feedback on endogenous AR expression. Treatment of basal prostate epithelial cells with inhibitors of epigenetic gene silencing was not efficient in inducing androgen-dependent transcription of AR target genes, suggesting the importance of missing cofactor(s).  Conclusions:   Regulatory mechanisms of AR and androgen-dependent AR target gene transcription are insufficiently understood and may be critical for prostate cancer initiation, progression and escape from standard therapy. The present model is useful for the study of context dependent activation of the AR and its transcriptome.""","""['Jan Roger Olsen', 'Waqas Azeem', 'Margrete Reime Hellem', 'Kristo Marvyin', 'Yaping Hua', 'Yi Qu', 'Lisha Li', 'Biaoyang Lin', 'Xi- Song Ke', 'Anne Margrete Øyan', 'Karl- Henning Kalland']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Complex impacts of PI3K/AKT inhibitors to androgen receptor gene expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Are androgen receptor variants a substitute for the full-length receptor?', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TRIM59 is suppressed by androgen receptor and acts to promote lineage plasticity and treatment-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Nonmalignant AR-positive prostate epithelial cells and cancer cells respond differently to androgen.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen conspires with the CD8+ T cell exhaustion program and contributes to sex bias in cancer.', 'Proteasome-Mediated Regulation of GATA2 Expression and Androgen Receptor Transcription in Benign Prostate Epithelial Cells.']"""

Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4) is a serine protease that is overproduced in localized prostate cancer and is abundant in prostate cancer bone metastases. In vitro, KLK4 induces tumor-promoting phenotypes; however, the underlying proteolytic mechanism is undefined. The protein topography and migration analysis platform (PROTOMAP) was used for high-depth identification of KLK4 substrates secreted by prostate cancer bone metastasis-derived PC-3 cells to delineate the mechanism of KLK4 action in advanced prostate cancer. Thirty-six putative novel substrates were determined from the PROTOMAP analysis. In addition, KLK4 cleaved the established substrate, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, thus validating the approach. KLK4 activated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), a protease that promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis. MMP1 was produced in the tumor compartment of prostate cancer bone metastases, highlighting its accessibility to KLK4 at this site. KLK4 further liberated an N-terminal product, with purported angiogenic activity, from thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and cleaved TSP1 in an osteoblast-derived matrix. This is the most comprehensive analysis of the proteolytic action of KLK4 in an advanced prostate cancer model to date, highlighting KLK4 as a potential multifunctional regulator of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Ruth A Fuhrman-Luck', 'Scott H Stansfield', 'Carson R Stephens', 'Daniela Loessner', 'Judith A Clements']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Murine, but not human, ephrin-B2 can be efficiently cleaved by the serine protease kallikrein-4: implications for xenograft models of human prostate cancer.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 induces cancer-associated fibroblast features in prostate-derived stromal cells.', 'Integration of Two In-depth Quantitative Proteomics Approaches Determines the Kallikrein-related Peptidase 7 (KLK7) Degradome in Ovarian Cancer Cell Secretome.', 'The role of kallikrein-related peptidases in prostate cancer: potential involvement in an epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer and the potential role of kallikrein serine proteases.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Intratumoral immune heterogeneity of prostate cancer characterized by typing and hub genes.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Elevated levels of both microRNA 378 (miR-378) and kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4) mRNA are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'KLK4 Induces Anti-Tumor Effects in Human Xenograft Mouse Models of Orthotopic and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 202 operable prostate cancer Slovenian patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. We retrospectively constructed tissue microarrays of their prostatic specimens for fluorescence in situ hybridization, with appropriate signals obtained in 148 patients for subsequent statistical analyses.  Results:   The following genetic aberrations were found: TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, TMPRSS2 split (a non-ERG translocation) and ERG split (an ERG translocation without involvement of TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion happened in 63 patients (42 %), TMPRSS2 split in 12 patients and ERG split in 8 patients. Association was tested between TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and several clinicopathological variables, i.e., pT stage, extended lymph node dissection status, and Gleason score, correcting for multiple comparisons. Only the association with pT stage was significant at p = 0.05: Of 62 patients with pT3 stage, 34 (55 %) had TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. In pT3 stage patients, stronger (but not significant) association between eLND status and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion was detected. We detected TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in 64 % of the pT3 stage patients where we did not perform an extended lymph node dissection.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that it is possible to predict pT3 stage at final histology from TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion at initial core needle biopsy.

Methods:   The authors identified patients aged ≥18 years who were diagnosed with a primary malignancy from the 10 most common cancer sites (prostate, breast, lung, colon, rectum, bladder, uterus, kidney, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) between 1992 and 2008 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Factors associated with the incidence of second primary malignancies were explored using bivariable and multivariable models, and mortality attributable to first and second primary malignancies was examined.  Results:   A cohort of 2,116,163 patients was identified, 170,865 of whom (8.1%) developed a second primary malignancy. Survivors of bladder cancer had the highest risk of developing a second cancer. In a multivariable model controlling for age, race, tumor grade, stage of disease, marital status, educational level, and income, a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratios of 2.70 and 2.88, respectively, for men and women) and bladder cancer (hazard ratios of 1.88 and 1.66, respectively, for men and women) predicted the highest risk of developing a second cancer. For patients with 2 incident cancers, 13% died of their initial cancer, but greater than one-half (55%) died of their second primary malignancy. Lung cancer was the cause of death in 12% of patients with 2 incident cancers.  Conclusions:   Nearly 1 in 12 patients diagnosed with a common cancer developed a second malignancy, the most common of which was lung cancer. Greater than one-half of patients with 2 incident cancers died of their secondary malignancy. The findings from the current study may inform care strategies among cancer survivors.

To elucidate whether genetic variants of CD24 are associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer and its disease status, we conducted a case-control association study with two P170 C/T and P-534 A/C polymorphisms of CD24 in 590 patients with prostate cancer and 590 healthy controls. A significant increased risk of prostate cancer was found in men with the P170T/T genotype over the P170C/C genotype (odd ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.63, P = 0.008), and in men with the P-534C/C genotype over the P-534A/A genotype (odd ratio = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.18-2.26, P = 0.003). Cochran-Armitage trend analysis showed that the P170T allele was significantly correlated with an increased risk of prostate cancer progression (P = 0.029, trend between genotypes and stages) and this observation was also validated in an independent sample cohort. Next, we found that tumors with P170T or P-534C alleles had more twofold increased protein expressions of CD24 as compared to those with P170C or P-534A alleles, respectively. Likewise, tumors with a combination of P170T/T and P-534C/C genotypes were associated with a high mRNA level of CD24.

Men with mCRPC are at high risk of death. Whether SREs predict mortality is unclear. We tested the association between SREs and overall survival (OS) in a multiethnic cohort with bone mCRPC, controlling for key covariates unavailable in claims data such as bone pain, number of bone metastases and PSA doubling time (PSADT).  Methods:   We collected data on 233 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in 2000-2013 at two Veterans Affairs hospitals who later progressed to bone metastases. First occurrence of SRE and OS were collected from the medical records. Cox models were used to test the association between SRE and OS, treating SRE as a time-dependent variable. We adjusted for age, year, race, treatment center, biopsy Gleason, primary treatment to the prostate, PSA, PSADT, months from androgen deprivation therapy to CRPC, months from CRPC to metastasis and number of bone metastases at initial bone metastasis diagnosis. In a secondary analysis, we also adjusted for bone pain.  Results:   During follow-up, 88 (38%) patients had an SRE and 198 (85%) died. After adjusting for risk factors, SRE was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR)=1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.30; P=0.001).

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 65 patients who were diagnosed as clinical stage T1c prostate cancer (PC) and underwent RRP between January 2010 and June 2013. Pathological specimens of PNB and RRP were separately examined for the parameters of PNI, vascular invasion (VI), Gleason Score (GS) and SMP.  Results:   The patients' mean age was 63.65 ± 4.93 (range 47- 75) years. PNI in PNB specimens were identified in 12 of 65 patients and 11 of 12 patients showed SMP on RRP specimens. While 53 of 65 patients had not PNI on PNB, only 11 of them demonstrated SMP on RRP specimens. SMP was 30.64-fold more frequently encountered in PNB specimens obtained from PNI-positive patients relative to PNI-negative patients. In our study, PNI detected in PNB specimens was statistically significantly associated with SMP on RRP specimens (P = 0.0001).

IL12 shows anti-tumour activity. As local irradiation might induce additional necrosis in solid tumours, we aimed to evaluate the increase in intratumoural accumulation of NHS-IL12 after irradiation and correlate the findings with diffusion-weighted MRI studies in two xenograft models.  Methods:   Human rhabdomyosarcoma (A204) and prostate cancer (PC3) cells were studied in vitro and as subcutaneous xenografts. Radiation sensitivity of the cell lines was assessed in vitro by colony formation assays. In vivo tumour necrosis was assessed based on apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). Biodistribution of NHS-IL12 was evaluated with and without tumour irradiation using in vivo small-animal PET and ex vivo biodistribution.  Results:   A204 and PC3 differed in their intrinsic radiation sensitivity. Accordingly, radiation-induced tumour necrosis was found only in A204 xenografts. In comparison with control, ADC was significantly increased after irradiation of A204 tumours with 1 × 8.0 Gy and 5 × 2.0 Gy, whereas no change in ADC was observed in PC3 xenografts in all irradiation regimes. ADC correlated with histology. An enhanced uptake of radiolabelled NHS-IL12 in A204 tumours was detected by PET and ex vivo biodistribution after tumour irradiation. In PC3 tumours, no increase in NHS-IL12 uptake was observed.  Conclusions:   In dependence of the tumour model, tumour irradiation enhanced tumour necrosis measured in MRI and histology. In vivo PET and ex vivo biodistribution showed enhanced binding of NHS-IL12 in rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. Thus, enhanced binding of necrosis-targeting immunocytokines might be a novel mechanism of additive effects in combination with irradiation.""","""['Franziska Eckert', 'Julia Schmitt', 'Daniel Zips', 'Marcel A Krueger', 'Bernd J Pichler', 'Stephen D Gillies', 'Wolfgang Strittmatter', 'Rupert Handgretinger', 'Karin Schilbach']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['NHS-IL12, a Tumor-Targeting Immunocytokine.', 'Tumor-targeted IL-12 combined with local irradiation leads to systemic tumor control via abscopal effects in vivo.', 'The immunocytokine NHS-IL12 as a potential cancer therapeutic.', 'The antibody-based delivery of interleukin-12 to the tumor neovasculature eradicates murine models of cancer in combination with paclitaxel.', 'FDG small animal PET permits early detection of malignant cells in a xenograft murine model.', 'Exploiting docetaxel-induced tumor cell necrosis with tumor targeted delivery of IL-12.', 'Next Generation Immuno-Oncology Strategies: Unleashing NK Cells Activity.', 'The present and future of immunocytokines for cancer treatment.', 'NHS-IL12, a Tumor-Targeting Immunocytokine.', 'Immune Modulation Plus Tumor Ablation: Adjuvants and Antibodies to Prime and Boost Anti-Tumor Immunity In Situ.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 139 patients undergoing primary therapy for prostate cancer and 11 patients with recurrence were included. Data analysis focused on the following factors: date of primary diagnosis, Gleason score, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, PSA nadir, volume of the prostate in the transrectal ultrasound, biopsy of the prostate gland, androgen deprivation, chemotherapy, uroflowmetry, pre- and postoperative post-void residual urine (PVR), number of the needles in the prostate lobes and analysis of follow-up data.  Results:   In the primary therapy group, 87.6 % of the patients had a PSA of 0-4 ng/ml at the time of follow-up, while in the recurrence group 81.8 % of patients were within this range. Overall, 55.8 % of patients in the primary group had a PSA nadir under 0.1 ng/ml, 37.2 % under 1 ng/ml, 5.8 % under 5 ng/ml and 1.2 % (1 patient) over 5 ng/ml. In the recurrence group, 100 % had a PSA nadir under 0.1 ng/dl. Fifty patients of the primary group reported grade 1 toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria): 29 localized to the bladder and 21 to the rectum. Seventeen patients had grade 2 toxicity of the bladder and 1 patient had grade 3 toxicity of the bladder. Finally there was one grade 4 toxicity due to perforation of the sigmoid colon. In the recurrence group, 3 patients with grade 1 toxicity were observed (2 bladder and 1 bowl).

Herein, we report a novel rapid, cost-efficient and minimal-equipment assay named ""FusBLU"" for detecting TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions from urine. TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA was amplified by isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), magnetically-isolated, and detected through horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed colorimetric reaction. FusBLU was specific for TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA with a low visual detection limit of 10(5) copies. We also demonstrated assay readout versatility on 3 potentially useful platforms. The colorimetric readout was detectable by naked eye for a quick yes/no evaluation of gene fusion presence. On the other hand, a more quantitative TMPRSS2-ERG detection was achievable by absorbance/electrochemical measurements. FusBLU was successfully applied to 12 urinary samples and results were validated by gold-standard RT-qPCR. We also showed that sediment RNA was likely the main source of TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA in urinary samples.

This study aimed to identify CTV margins yielding 95% coverage of PCa tumors for prospective cases with high likelihood.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-five men with biopsy-confirmed clinical stage T1 or T2 PCa underwent pre-prostatectomy mpMRI, yielding T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and apparent diffusion coefficient images. Digitized whole-mount histology was contoured and registered to mpMRI scans (error ≤2 mm). Four observers contoured lesion GTVs on each mpMRI scan. CTVs were defined by isotropic and anisotropic expansion from these GTVs and from multiparametric (unioned) GTVs from 2 to 3 scans. Histologic coverage (proportions of tumor area on co-registered histology inside the CTV, measured for Gleason scores [GSs] ≥6 and ≥7) and prostate sparing (proportions of prostate volume outside the CTV) were measured. Nonparametric histologic-coverage prediction intervals defined minimal margins yielding 95% coverage for prospective cases with 78% to 92% likelihood.  Results:   On analysis of 72 true-positive tumor detections, 95% coverage margins were 9 to 11 mm (GS ≥ 6) and 8 to 10 mm (GS ≥ 7) for single-sequence GTVs and were 8 mm (GS ≥ 6) and 6 mm (GS ≥ 7) for 3-sequence GTVs, yielding CTVs that spared 47% to 81% of prostate tissue for the majority of tumors. Inclusion of T2-weighted contours increased sparing for multiparametric CTVs with 95% coverage margins for GS ≥6, and inclusion of dynamic contrast-enhanced contours increased sparing for GS ≥7. Anisotropic 95% coverage margins increased the sparing proportions to 71% to 86%.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-defined GTVs expanded by appropriate margins may support focal boosting or treatment of PCa; however, these margins, accounting for interobserver and intertumoral variability, may preclude highly conformal CTVs. Multiparametric GTVs and anisotropic margins may reduce the required margins and improve prostate sparing.""","""['Eli Gibson', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Cesare Romagnoli', 'Derek W Cool', 'Matthew Bastian-Jordan', 'Zahra Kassam', 'Mena Gaed', 'Madeleine Moussa', 'José A Gómez', 'Stephen E Pautler', 'Joseph L Chin', 'Cathie Crukley', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy in prostate cancer: the case of the missing target.', 'Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Risk stratification of prostate cancer utilizing apparent diffusion coefficient value and lesion volume on multiparametric MRI.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

As the current androgen deprivation therapy with anti-androgens may promote the neuroendocrine PCa (NEPCa) development, and few therapies can effectively suppress NEPCa, understanding the impact of NEPCa on PCa progression may help us to develop better therapies to battle PCa. Here, we found NEPCa cells could increase the docetaxel resistance of their neighboring PCa cells. Mechanism dissection revealed that through secretion of PTHrP, NEPCa cells could alter the p38/MAPK/Hsp27 signals in their neighboring PCa cells that resulted in increased androgen receptor (AR) activity via promoting AR nuclear translocation. The consequences of increased AR function might then increase docetaxel resistance via increasing p21 expression. In vivo xenograft mice experiments also confirmed that NEPCa could increase the docetaxel resistance of neighboring PCa, and targeting this newly identified PTHrP/p38/Hsp27/AR/p21 signaling pathway with either p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or shPTHrP may result in improving/restoring the docetaxel sensitivity to better suppress PCa.""","""['Y Cui', 'Y Sun', 'S Hu', 'J Luo', 'L Li', 'X Li', 'S Yeh', 'J Jin', 'C Chang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Infiltrating mast cells increase prostate cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistances via modulation of p38/p53/p21 and ATM signals.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell invasion via altering the sumoylation-phosphorylation of STAT3.', 'Anti-androgen enzalutamide enhances prostate cancer neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation via altering the infiltrated mast cells\xa0→\xa0androgen receptor (AR)\xa0→\xa0miRNA32 signals.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) positive vs negative roles in prostate cancer cell deaths including apoptosis, anoikis, entosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Involvement of parathyroid hormone-related peptide in the aggressive phenotype of colorectal cancer cells.', 'p38 MAPK Inhibition Mitigates Hypoxia-Induced AR Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine, which has been demonstrated to promote development of prostate cancer, colon cancer, skin cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreas cancer. IL-17 promotes prostate adenocarcinoma with a concurrent increase of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) expression in mouse prostate. Whether MMP7 mediates IL-17's action and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We generated Mmp7 and Pten double knockout (KO) (Mmp7-/-) mouse model and demonstrated that MMP7 promotes prostate adenocarcinoma through induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Pten-null mice. MMP7 disrupted E-cadherin/β-catenin complex to upregulate EMT transcription factors in mouse prostate tumors. IL-17 receptor C and Pten double KO mice recapitulated the weak EMT characteristics observed in Mmp7-/- mice. IL-17 induced MMP7 and EMT in human prostate cancer LNCaP, C4-2B and PC-3 cell lines, while small interfering RNA knockdown of MMP7 inhibited IL-17-induced EMT. Compound III, a selective MMP7 inhibitor, decreased development of invasive prostate cancer in Pten single KO mice. In human normal prostates and prostate tumors, IL-17 mRNA levels were positively correlated with MMP7 mRNA levels. These findings demonstrate that MMP7 mediates IL-17's function in promoting prostate carcinogenesis through induction of EMT, indicating IL-17-MMP7-EMT axis as a potential target for developing new strategies in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Q Zhang', 'S Liu', 'K R Parajuli', 'W Zhang', 'K Zhang', 'Z Mo', 'J Liu', 'Z Chen', 'S Yang', 'A R Wang', 'L Myers', 'Z You']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Interleukin-17 promotes formation and growth of prostate adenocarcinoma in mouse models.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Intact and Castrated PTEN Knockout Mice via Targeting PKCε, Stat3, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Markers.', 'Interleukin-17 Family Cytokines in Metabolic Disorders and Cancer.', 'Interleukin 17 and Its Involvement in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Microbiota as the unifying factor behind the hallmarks of cancer.', 'Plasma Exosomal microRNA Profile Reveals miRNA 148a-3p Downregulation in the Mucosal-Dominant Variant of Pemphigus Vulgaris.', 'Single cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is driven by variable cell states.', 'Unpacking the Complexity of Epithelial Plasticity: From Master Regulator Transcription Factors to Non-Coding RNAs.', 'The value of basement membrane-associated genes in the prognosis and immune regulation of glioma.']"""

Although ADT is usually initially effective, acquired resistance termed castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) develops. PTEN and TP53 are two of the most commonly deleted or mutated genes in prostate cancer, the compound loss of which is enriched in CRPC. To interrogate the metabolic alterations associated with survival following ADT, we used an orthotopic model of Pten/Tp53 null prostate cancer. Metabolite profiles and associated regulators were compared in tumors from androgen-intact mice and in tumors surviving castration. AR inhibition led to changes in the levels of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathway intermediates. As anticipated for inhibitory reciprocal feedback between AR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, pAKT levels were increased in androgen-deprived tumors. Elevated mitochondrial hexokinase 2 (HK2) levels and enzyme activities also were observed in androgen-deprived tumors, consistent with pAKT-dependent HK2 protein induction and mitochondrial association.

Methods and materials:   To determine the minimum value, 122 patients were classified into 6 groups according to the bladder volume at TP: <100 mL (group 1), 100-149 mL (group 2), 150-199 mL (group 3), 200-249 mL (group 4), 250-299 mL (group 5), and ≥300 mL (group 6). Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy (V70Gy) and V50Gy were calculated in each subgroup and compared with the bladder dose-volume constraints specified in our institution. To determine the maximum value, 64 patients who underwent uniform nursing interventions were classified into the same 6 groups. Bladder volumes on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were measured once weekly during treatment, for a total of 8 measurements. Relative bladder volumes (bladder volume on CBCT image [mL]/bladder volume at TP [mL] × 100%) were evaluated in each of the 6 subgroups.  Results:   The upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals of the mean V70Gy and V50Gy values in group 1 exceeded the dose constraints at our institution. The mean relative bladder volumes were 104%, 91%, 77%, 81%, 63%, and 59% in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The institutional criterion of 70% for the mean relative bladder volume was achieved in groups 1-4, but it could not be achieved in groups 5-6.

In cultured prostate cancer cells, GATA2 coordinates with androgen receptor (AR) to regulate gene transcription. In the murine prostate, among six GATA members, GATA2 and GATA3 are expressed. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that both GATA factors predominantly localize in the nuclei of luminal epithelial cells. The pioneer factor FoxA1 is exclusively detected in the luminal cells, whereas AR is detected in both luminal and basal cells. Using genetic engineering, we generated prostate-specific GATA2 and GATA3 knockout (KO) mice. Ablation of single GATA gene had marginal effect on prostate morphology and AR target gene expression, likely due to their genetic compensation. Double KO mice exhibited PIN III to IV lesions, but decreased prostate to body weight ratio, altered AR target gene expression, and expansion of p63-positive basal cells. However, deletion of GATA2 and GATA3 did not reduce the mRNA or protein levels of AR or FoxA1, indicating that GATA factors are not required for AR or FoxA1 expression in adult prostate. Surprisingly, GATA2 and GATA3 exhibit minimal expression in the ventral prostatic (VP) lobe. In contrast, FoxA1 and AR expression levels in VP are at least as high as those in anterior prostatic (AP) and dorsal-lateral prostatic (DLP) lobes. Together, our results indicate that GATA2 and GATA3 are essential for adult murine prostate function and in vivo AR signaling, and the lack of the GATA factor expression in the VP suggests a fundamental difference between VP and other prostatic lobes.""","""['Lijuan Xiao', 'Qin Feng', 'Zheng Zhang', 'Fen Wang', 'John P Lydon', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Li Xin', 'Nicholas Mitsiades', 'Bin He']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['FOXA1 acts upstream of GATA2 and AR in hormonal regulation of gene expression.', 'Three-tiered role of the pioneer factor GATA2 in promoting androgen-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptionally regulates semaphorin 3C in a GATA2-dependent manner.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Functional characterization of ABCA4 genetic variants related to Stargardt disease.', 'FOXA1 in prostate cancer.', 'A feedback loop between GATA2-AS1 and GATA2 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness via recruiting DDX3X.', 'Inhibition of GATA2 in prostate cancer by a clinically available small molecule.', 'Regulation of stem/progenitor cell maintenance by BMP5 in prostate homeostasis and cancer initiation.']"""

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is therefore the gold standard treatment to suppress malignant progression of PCa. Nevertheless, due to the development of castration resistance, recurrence of disease after initial response to ADT is a major obstacle to successful treatment. As G-protein coupled receptors play a fundamental role in PCa physiology, they might represent promising alternative or combinatorial targets for advanced diseases. Here, we verified gene expression of the olfactory receptors (ORs) OR51E1 [prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptor 2 (PSGR2)] and OR51E2 (PSGR) in human PCa tissue by RNA-Seq analysis and RT-PCR and elucidated the subcellular localization of both receptor proteins in human prostate tissue. The OR51E1 agonist nonanoic acid (NA) leads to the phosphorylation of various protein kinases and growth suppression of the PCa cell line LNCaP. Furthermore, treatment with NA causes reduction of androgen-mediated AR target gene expression. Interestingly, NA induces cellular senescence, which coincides with reduced E2F1 mRNA levels. In contrast, treatment with the structurally related compound 1-nonanol or the OR2AG1 agonist amyl butyrate, neither of which activates OR51E1, did not lead to reduced cell growth or an induction of cellular senescence. However, decanoic acid, another OR51E1 agonist, also induces cellular senescence. Thus, our results suggest the involvement of OR51E1 in growth processes of PCa cells and its impact on AR-mediated signaling.

In this population, a history of prior cancer frequently results in exclusion from clinical trials and may influence therapeutic decisions. We therefore determined prevalence and prognostic impact of prior cancer among these patients.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients>65years of age diagnosed 1992-2009 with locally advanced lung cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked dataset. We characterized prior cancer by prevalence, type, stage, and timing. We compared all-cause and lung cancer-specific survival between patients with and without prior cancer using propensity score-adjusted Cox regression.  Results:   51,542 locally advanced lung cancer patients were included; 15.8% had a history of prior cancer. Prostate (25%), gastrointestinal (17%), breast (16%), and other genitourinary (15%) were the most common types of prior cancer, and 76% percent of prior cancers were localized or in situ stage. Approximately half (54%) of prior cancers were diagnosed within 5 years of the index lung cancer date. Patients with prior cancer had similar (propensity-score adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P=0.005) and improved lung cancer-specific (HR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86; P<0.001) survival compared to patients with no prior cancer.

EM, consisting of active surveillance or observation for men with low-risk prostate cancer, is an increasingly recognized management option, given the morbidity and lack of a survival benefit associated with definitive treatment. However, the influence of cancer center type on treatment selection is uncertain.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Data Base from 2010 to 2013. Men with low-risk prostate cancer were divided by management strategy into groups consisting of EM or definitive treatment. The association between management strategy and facility type (community vs academic) was characterized using 2-level hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression models.  Results:   There were 52,417 (57%) men evaluated at community centers and 39,139 men (43%) evaluated at academic centers. Patients evaluated at academic centers were significantly more likely to receive EM than those at community centers (17% vs 8%, P < .001). After adjusting for pertinent covariates, evaluation at an academic vs community facility was independently associated with increased odds of EM utilization (adjusted odds ratio 2.70, 95% confidence interval 2.00-3.66). Fifty-one percent of the total variance was explained by interfacility variation.  Conclusion:   The likelihood of receiving EM for low-risk prostate cancer was significantly lower in men evaluated at community centers.

The objective of this study was to analyse 11C-acetate PET/CT image metrics in relation to survival.  Methods:   All patients undergoing 11C-acetate PET/CT in one university hospital from 2005 to 2011 due to PSA relapse after previous prostatectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Two groups of patients were compared: those who died from PCa and those who were censored. All previously reported findings of local recurrence, regional or distal lymph node metastases and bone metastases were counted and evaluated regarding 11C-acetate uptake intensity (SUVmax) and tumour volume. Total tumour volume and total lipogenic activity (TLA, summed SUVmax × TV) were calculated. Survival analysis in the entire study population was followed by Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) analysis.  Results:   A total of 121 patients were included, and 22 PCa-specific deaths were recorded. The mean PSA level at the time of PET was 2.69 ± 4.35 ng/mL. The median follow-up of the study population was 79 ± 28 months. PET identified at least one PCa lesion in 53 % of patients. Five-year PCa-specific survival after PET was 80 % and 100 % in patients with a positive and a negative PET scan, respectively (p < 0.001). Time-to-death was linearly correlated with highest SUVmax (r = -0.55, p = 0.01) and nonlinearly with TLA (r = -0.75, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed statistical significance for number of bone metastases (HR 1.74, p = 0.01), tertile of TLA (HR 5.63, p = 0.029) and postoperative Gleason score (HR 1.84, p = 0.045).  Conclusion:   Malignant 11C-acetate accumulation measured with PET/CT is a strong predictor of survival in the setting of PSA relapse after prostatectomy.

Endorectal coils are commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated, bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to other tested bias correction methods.

Materials & methods:   The clinical information and follow-up data of 612 patients who had extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margin at the time of robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in the single center between 2005 and 2014 were modeled using Fine and Gray's competing risk regression analysis for BCR. Extraprostatic extensions were divided into categories according to location as apex, base, anterior, posterior, lateral, and posterolateral. Extraprostatic extensions were defined as presence of tumor beyond the borders of the gland in the posterior and posterolateral regions. Tumor admixed with periprostatic fat was additionally considered as having extraprostatic extension if capsule was vague in the anterior, apex, and base regions. Positive surgical margins were defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked margin on the inspection under microscopy. Association of these classifications with the site of PSM was evaluated by Cohen's Kappa analysis for concordance and logistic regression for the odds of apical and base PSMs.  Results:   Median follow-up duration was 36.5 months (interquartile range[IQR] 20.1-36.5). Apex involvement was found in 158 (25.8%) patients and base in 110 (18.0%) patients. PSMs generally were found to be associated with increased risk of BCR regardless of location, with BCR risk highest for base PSM (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.40-2.68, p<0.001) after adjusting for age, initial prostate-specific antigen, pathologic Gleason score, and pathologic T stage in the multivariate model. Logistic regression for PSM site revealed no significant correlation of apex PSM with extraprostatic extension location, while base PSM was associated with increased odds of anterior (OR 2.513, 95% CI 1.425-4.430, p = 0.001) and lateral (OR 2.715, 95% CI 1.735-4.250, p<0.001) extraprostatic extension.  Conclusion:   Extension into the extraprostatic tissue on some specific locations do not share the same recur risk due to the different anatomical structures surrounding the organ. Anterior and lateral EPEs are prone to leave PSM on the base of the prostate, probably because of the lack of anatomical barricades slowing down the direct invasion process. More study on the pattern of spread of the tumors found to have extraprostatic extension is suggested for optimal planning of the operation extent and of the adjuvant radiotherapy.""","""['Yong Jin Kang', 'Mark Joseph Abalajon', 'Won Sik Jang', 'Jong Kyou Kwon', 'Cheol Yong Yoon', 'Joo Yong Lee', 'Kang Su Cho', 'Won Sik Ham', 'Young Deuk Choi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Learning curve of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: Comprehensive evaluation and cumulative summation analysis of oncological outcomes.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of length and location of positive margins in predicting biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Tumor Location and a Tumor Volume over 2.8 cc Predict the Prognosis for Japanese Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Radical or Not-So-Radical Prostatectomy: Do Surgical Margins Matter?', 'Prediction of extraprostatic extension on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging in patients with anterior prostate cancer.', 'Prostate MRI prior to radical prostatectomy: effects on nerve sparing and pathological margin status.']"""

This study examines the influence of certain perinatal and childhood-related factors on prostate cancer risk overall and by Gleason score at biopsy.  Methods:   MCC-Spain is a multicase-control study where 1088 histologically-confirmed incident prostate cancer cases (aged 42-85years) and 1345 population-based controls (aged 38-85years), frequency matched by age and province of recruitment, were recruited in 7 Spanish provinces. Self-reported perinatal and childhood-related characteristics were directly surveyed by trained staff. The association with prostate cancer risk, globally and according to Gleason score at biopsy, was evaluated using logistic and multinomial regression mixed models, adjusting for age, family history of prostate cancer, educational level and body mass index one year before the interview, and including the province as a random effect term.  Results:   Most perinatal factors were not related to prostate cancer risk, with the exception of middle-high socioeconomic level at birth (OR for high grade tumors=1.36; 95%CI=1.09-1.68). Regarding puberty, risk rose by 6% for each year of delayed onset (OR=1.06; 95%CI=1.01-1.10; p trend=0.016), with a clear excess of risk in men who reached puberty after age 15 (OR:1.35; 95%CI=1.08-1.68).

Study design:   Descriptive, correlational study.  Subjects and setting:   One hundred twelve men who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between December 2010 and December 2012 at the Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands were included in this study. After surgery, a Charriere 20 (20F) silicone catheter was left indwelling for 1 week.  Methods:   Data were gathered from 2 sources; we reviewed participants' medical records, and participants completed a questionnaire designed for this study. Pearson χ tests were used to analyze associations between dichotomous and ordinal variables and catheter-related problems. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the relationships between continuous factors and catheter-related problems.  Results:   Seventy-five percent of participants reported at least 1 catheter-related problem. Univariate regression analyses revealed correlations between body weight and experiencing catheter-related problems (odds ratio [OR] = 1.050; P = .028) and between body mass index and experiencing catheter-related problems (OR = 1.159; P = .049).

Epithelial CTCs detected by the CellSearch were mostly lost during the ISET-filtration. AR-amplification was detected in CellSearch-captured CTCs, but not in ISET-enriched CTCs which harbor exclusively AR gain of copies. Eighty-eight percent concordance for ERG-rearrangement was observed between metastatic biopsies and CTCs even if additional ERG-alteration patterns were detected in ISET-enriched CTCs indicating a higher heterogeneity in CTCs.Molecular screening of metastatic biopsies is achievable in a multicenter context.

This approach leads to unnecessary biopsies in patients without PCa and also to the detection of clinical insignificant PCa. Better tools are wanted. We have evaluated the performance of real-time elastography (RTE) combined with prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) in an initial biopsy setting with the goal of better identifying patients in need of prostate biopsies.  Methods:   127 patients were included in this study; three were excluded because of not measureable PCA3 score leading to 124 evaluable patients. A cut-off value of 35 was used for PCA3. All patients were examined with a Hitachi Preirus with an endfire probe for RTE, a maximum of five targeted biopsies were obtained from suspicious lesions detected by RTE. All patients then had a 10-core systematic biopsy performed by another urologist unaware of the RTE results. The study includes follow-up data for a minimum of three years; all available histopathological data are included in the analysis.  Results:   There was a significant difference in PCA3 score: 26.6 for benign disease, 73.6 for cancer patients (p < 0.001). 70 patients (56 %) were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the study period, 21 (30 %) low-risk, 32 (46 %) intermediate-risk and 17 (24 %) high-risk. RTE and PCA3 were significant markers for predicting intermediate- and high-risk PCa (p = 0.001). The combination of RTE and PCA3 had a sensitivity of 96 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90 % for the group of intermediate- and high-risk PCa together and a NPV for high-risk PCa of 100 %. If both parameters are positive there is a high probability of detecting intermediate- or high-risk PCa, if both parameters are negative there is only a small chance of missing prostate cancer with documented treatment benefit.

Suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a potential strategy for chemoprevention and therapy. As aberrant activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway contributes to prostate cancer progression, we evaluated the effect of delphinidin on this pathway in human PC3 prostate cancer cells. An MTT assay showed that treatment with delphinidin (15-180 μM, 72 hours) resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibition of cells. Treatment with delphinidin increased the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on β-catenin and decreased the levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Moreover, treatment with delphinidin inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the expression of β-catenin target genes such as cyclin D1, c-myc, Axin-2, and T cell factor-1. Delphinidin also induced the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin proteins. Our results indicate that inhibition of cell growth by delphinidin is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of the β-catenin signaling pathway.

Materials and methods:   Microbubble-liposome complexes conjugated with anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (Her2) antibodies were developed to target human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. Intracellular delivery of MLC was observed by confocal microscopy. We loaded MLC with survivin-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) and doxorubicin, and delivered it into prostate cancer cells. The release of these agents was facilitated by ultrasound application. Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay after the delivery of siRNA and doxorubicin. Survivin-targeted siRNA loaded MLC was delivered into the xenograft mouse tumor model. Western blotting was performed to quantify the expression of survivin in vivo.  Results:   Confocal microscopy demonstrated substantial intracellular uptake of MLCs in LNCaP, which expresses higher levels of Her2 than PC-3. The viability of LNCaP cells was significantly reduced after the delivery of MLCs loaded with siRNA and doxorubicin (85.0 ± 2.9%), which was further potentiated by application of ultrasound (55.0 ± 3.5%, p = 0.009).

It has been established that androgen receptor (AR) reactivation is responsible for the recurrence of prostate cancer after ADT. Thus, targeting different pathways that regulate AR stability and activity should be a promising strategy for treatment of CRPC. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are chaperones that modify stability and activity of their client proteins. HSP90, a major player in the HSP family, regulates stability of many proteins, including AR and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell-cycle events. Further, HSP90 is overexpressed in different cancers, including prostate cancer. Herein, we show that cotreatment of prostate cancer with AR antagonist enzalutamide and HSP90 inhibitor leads to more severe cell death due to a synergistic reduction of AR protein. Interestingly, we show that overexpression of Plk1 rescued the synergistic effect and that cotargeting HSP90 and Plk1 also leads to more severe cell death. Mechanistically, we show that E3 ligase CHIP, in addition to targeting AR, is responsible for the degradation of Plk1 as well. These findings suggest that cotargeting HSP90 and some of its client proteins may be a useful strategy in treatment of CRPC.

We compared 4 different anti-HER3 antibodies to explain the differences found in the staining results reported in the literature.  Materials and methods:   Four commercial HER3 antibodies were tested on FFPE samples including mouse monoclonal antibody clones, DAK-H3-IC and RTJ1, rabbit monoclonal antibody clone SP71, and rabbit polyclonal antibody (SAB4500793). Membranous and cytoplasmic staining patterns were analyzed and scored as 0, 1+, or 2+ according to the intensity of the staining and completeness of membranous and cytoplasmic staining. A large collection of HER2-amplified breast cancers (n=177) was stained with the best performing HER3 antibody. The breast cancer cell line, MDA-453, and human prostate tissue were used as positive controls. IHC results were confirmed by analysis of flow cytometry performed on breast cancer cell lines. Staining results of FFPE samples were compared with samples fixed with an epitope-sensitive fixative (PAXgene).  Results:   Clear circumferential cell membrane staining was found only with the HER3 antibody clone DAK-H3-IC. Other antibodies (RTJ1, SP71, and polyclonal) yielded uncertain and nonreproducible staining results. In addition to cell membrane staining, DAK-H3-IC was also localized to the cytoplasm, but no nuclear staining was observed. In HER2-amplified breast cancers, 80% of samples were classified as 1+ or 2+ according to the HER3 staining on the cell membrane. The results from FFPE cell line samples were comparable to those obtained from unfixed cells in flow cytometry. IHC conducted on FFPE samples and on PAXgene-fixed samples showed equivalent results.  Conclusions:   We conclude that IHC with the monoclonal antibody, DAK-H3-IC, on FFPE samples is a reliable staining method for use in translational research.

Knockdown of ClpXP subunits ClpP or ClpX induces the accumulation of misfolded SDHB, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production while activating ""stress"" signals of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and autophagy. Deregulated mitochondrial respiration induced by ClpXP targeting causes oxidative stress, which in turn reduces tumor cell proliferation, suppresses cell motility, and abolishes metastatic dissemination in vivo. ClpP is universally overexpressed in primary and metastatic human cancer, correlating with shortened patient survival. Therefore, tumors exploit ClpXP-directed proteostasis to maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics, buffer oxidative stress, and enable metastatic competence.

Studies on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT-116, and their cognate knockouts for p53, were not entirely consistent with the assumption above. Exploring alternative explanations for such conflicting behaviour, we observed that expression of the ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2), a regulator of cell component efflux, had important effects on PDT-generated DNA injury in PC3 cells (prostate) which are p53(-/-) and positive for ABCG2. Addition of an ABCG2 inhibitor in ABCG2 positive A549 (p53(+/+) ) and PC3 (p53(-/-) ) cells eliminated resistance to DNA damage.

Materials and methods:   Biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer patients were enrolled, provided that they had the following characteristics: initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/ml, Gleason Score < 7, International Prostate Symptom Score < 7. The treatment schedule was 35 Gy in five fractions, delivered with volumetric modulated arcs with flattening filter free beams. Toxicity was recorded according to CTCAE criteria v4.0. Biochemical failure was calculated according to the Phoenix definition. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire was used to record health-related quality of life.  Results:   Between December 2011 and March 2015, 90 patients were enrolled (53 low risk, 37 intermediate risk). The median age was 71 years (range 48-82). In total, 58 (64.5%) of the patients had Gleason Score=6, the remaining had Gleason Score=7.The median initial PSA was 6.9 ng/ml (range 2.7-17.0). Acute toxicity was mild, with 32.2 patients presenting grade 1 urinary toxicity and 32.2% of patients presenting grade 2 urinary toxicity, mainly represented by urgency, dysuria and stranguria. Rectal grade 1 toxicity was found in 15.5% of patients, whereas grade 2 toxicity was recorded in 6.6% of patients. Regarding late toxicity, grade 1 proctitis was recorded in 11.1% of patients and grade 1 urinary in 38.8%; only two events of grade 2 urinary toxicity were observed (transient urethral stenosis, resolved by a 24 h catheterisation). At a median follow-up of 27 months (6-62 months) only two intermediate risk patients experienced a biochemical failure. Health-related quality of life revealed a slight worsening in all the domains during treatment, with a return to baseline 3 months after treatment.

With the renewed effort by the national health insurance scheme to cover the informal sector, it becomes imperative to determine the cost implication for managing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and the cost effective drug combination to be adopted. The objective of this study is to estimate cost effective analysis (CEA) of fixed -dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin compared with dutasteride monotherapy from the health service provider perspective design.  Methods:   An interactive Markov's model was used to generate incremental cost per QALY and incremental cost per life years gained. 2.9 million Men who were 50 years of age were fed into the model. The outcome measures included: costs of drug treatment, consultation, acute urinary retention (AUR), transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), hospitalisation post TURP, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost per life years gained, and incremental cost per QALY gained.  Results:   Fixed-dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin (FDCT) produced an Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$1481.92 per Quality adjusted for life-years saved.  Conclusion:   Universal FDCT provision for Nigeria has major economic implications.

Objective:   To identify patterns of aberration in the PI3K and interactive pathways that might lead to targeted therapy opportunities in clinical practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2013 through December 2014, 19 784 consecutive tumor samples (>40 cancer types) were sent from thousands of clinicians in 60 countries to a single commercial laboratory for molecular profiling, including next generation sequencing, protein expression (immunohistochemical analysis [IHC]), and gene amplification (fluorescent in situ hybridization or chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Main outcomes and measures:   Patterns in targetable genomic and proteomic alterations in the PI3K pathway and coincidence with hormone receptor and HER2 alterations.  Exposures:   Molecular profiling across solid tumors.  Results:   Overall, 38% of patients had an alteration in 1 or more PI3K pathway components, most commonly phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss (by IHC) (30% of all patients), followed by mutations in PIK3CA (13%), PTEN (6%), or AKT1 (1%). Seventy percent of patients with endometrial cancer and more than 50% of patients with breast, prostate, anal, hepatocellular, colorectal, and cervical cancer exhibited alterations in at least 1 PI3K pathway gene and/or gene product. Examples of frequent aberrations included PTEN loss in hepatocellular (57% of patients), colorectal (48%), gastric (36%), prostate (52%), and endometrial cancer (49%); PIK3CA mutations in endometrial (37%), breast (31%), cervical (29%), and anal cancer (27%). PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations occurred more frequently in the presence of hormone receptor overexpression (androgen, progesterone, or estrogen receptor). PIK3CA mutations were also more common in the HER2-positive than in the HER2-negative group; the opposite pattern was seen for PTEN mutation or PTEN loss.

PSMA participates in various biological functions depending on the substrate available in the particular tissue; in the brain, PSMA cleaves the abundant neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate to regulate release of key neurotransmitters, while intestinal PSMA cleaves polyglutamated peptides to supply dietary folate. PSMA expression is also progressively upregulated in prostate cancer where it correlates with tumor progression as well as in tumor vasculature, where it regulates angiogenesis. The previous research determined that PSMA cleavage of small peptides generated via matrix metalloprotease-mediated proteolysis of the extracellular matrix protein laminin potently activated endothelial cells, integrin signaling and angiogenesis, although the specific peptide substrates were not identified. Herein, using enzymatic analyses and LC/MS, we unequivocally demonstrate that several laminin-derived peptides containing carboxy-terminal glutamate moieties (LQE, IEE, LNE) are bona fide substrates for PSMA. Subsequently, the peptide products were tested for their effects on angiogenesis in various models. We report that LQ, the dipeptide product of PSMA cleavage of LQE, efficiently activates endothelial cells in vitro and enhances angiogenesis in vivo. Importantly, LQE is not cleaved by an inactive PSMA enzyme containing an active site mutation (E424S). Endothelial cell activation by LQ was dependent on integrin beta-1-induced activation of focal adhesion kinase.

Nevertheless, treatment is not optimal. The purpose of this study was to analyze BPRMS patients treated within the CWS-2002P trial regarding outcome, treatment modalities, complications, and to compare the data with the precursor trial CWS-96.  Methods:   Fifty children with localized embryonal BPRMS were analyzed. Eight patients were excluded. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At week 9, reassessment using MRI scan was performed. Depending on tumor size, age, and response, local therapy consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery was initiated. After local therapy, systemic therapy was continued.  Results:   Patients' median age was 35.6 months. Median follow-up was 59 months. The 5-year OS was 84.5 % and the 5-year ES 79.9 %. Ten patients underwent combined radiochemotherapy and tumor resection (5-year ES: 87.5 %). Six patients were treated solely with radiochemotherapy (5-year ES: 60 %). Twenty-six patients received preoperative chemotherapy followed by tumor resection (ES: 80.8). One patient was treated with chemotherapy only and survived. The bladder preservation rate was 80.9 %.  Conclusions:   The outcome within the CWS-2002P trial regarding OS and ES seemed to be better than in the precursor trial CWS-96 due to a reduction of protocol violations, but there was no statistical significant difference possibly due to low numbers.

This study examined the relationship between these two biomarkers and the presence of prostate cancer. We measured their major metabolites in urine collected from 120 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 240 age-matched controls from January 2011 to April 2014. Compared with patients with lower urinary melatonin-sulfate or melatonin-sulfate/cortisol (MT/C) ratio levels, those with above-median levels were significantly less likely to have prostate cancer (adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.35-0.99; aOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.77) or advanced stage prostate cancer (aOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.89; aOR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.17-0.62). The combined effect of both low MT/C ratios and PSA levels exceeding 10 ng/ml was an 8.82-fold greater likelihood of prostate cancer and a 32.06-fold greater likelihood of advanced stage prostate cancer, compared to those with both high MT/C ratios and PSA levels less than 10 ng/ml. In conclusion, patients with high melatonin-sulfate levels or a high MT/C ratio were less likely to have prostate cancer or advanced stage prostate. Besides, a finding of a low MT/C ratio combined with a PSA level exceeding 10 ng/ml showed the greatest potential in detecting prostate cancer and advanced stage prostate cancer.""","""['Shu-Yu Tai', 'Shu-Pin Huang', 'Bo-Ying Bao', 'Ming-Tsang Wu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Decreased fucosylated PSA as a urinary marker for high Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein 2 (hK2) in urine are not clinically useful for early detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary Biomarker Panel to Improve Accuracy in Predicting Prostate Biopsy Result in Chinese Men with PSA 4-10\u2009ng/mL.', 'Tumor markers.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed images of 79 PC patients undergoing 18F-choline PET/CT before RP or RT. Based on concomitant administration of neoadjuvant ADT at the time of 18F-choline PET/CT, patients were subdivided into naïve group (Group 1) and neoadjuvant ADT group (Group 2). PET/CT results, SUVmax and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) for each site were re-assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians with more than 5 years of experience. A chi-square and a U-Mann Whitney test were used to compare the two groups.  Results:   Sixty-two patients were included in Group 1, while 17 in Group 2. PET/CT was positive in all patients, in particular: 54 had a significant uptake in prostate alone, 12 in prostate plus lymph nodes (LN), 4 in prostate plus LN and bone, 3 in prostate plus bone and 6 in prostate plus other organs (such as lung or thyroid). PET/CT was more frequently positive in a different site, outside the prostate, in Group 1 as compared to Group 2 (P<0.001). Conversely, median SUVmax and MTV in the prostate resulted significantly lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 (5.34 vs. 7.72 and 3.66 vs. 6.86 cm3, respectively; both P<0.05).

Despite the high mortality associated with PCa, the only established risk factors are age, race and family history. A possible association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and PCa was firstly described in 2004 and several subsequent studies in biopsy cohorts have shown conflicting results. Aim of our multicentre prospective study was to investigate the association between MetS and PCa in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   From January 2012 to June 2015, 349 consecutive men undergoing RP for PCa at three centres in Italy were enrolled into a prospective database. Body Mass Index (BMI) as well as waist circumference was measured before RP. Blood samples were also collected and tested for total PSA, fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDLs. Blood pressure was also recorded. We evaluated the association between MetS, defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III, PCa stage (advanced stage defined as pT ≥ 3 or N1) and grade (high grade defined as Gleason Score ≥ 4 + 3) using logistic regression analyses.  Results:   Median age and preoperative PSA levels were 66 years (IQR: 61-69) and 7 ng/ml (IQR: 5-10), respectively. Median BMI was 26.12 kg/m(2) (IQR 24-29) with 56 (16 %) obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) patients and 87 (25 %) patients with MetS. At pathological evaluation, advanced PCa and high-grade disease were present in 126 (36 %) and 145 (41.5 %) patients, respectively. MetS was significantly associated with advanced PCa (45/87, 51 % vs 81/262, 31 %; p = 0.008) and high-grade disease (47/87, 54 % vs 98/262, 37 %; p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, MetS was an independent predictor of pathological stage ≥ pT3a or N1 (OR: 2.227; CI: 1.273-3.893; p = 0.005) and Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 (OR: 2.007, CI: 1.175-3.428; p = 0.011).  Conclusions:   We firstly demonstrated in a European radical retropubic prostatectomy cohort study that MetS is associated with an increased risk of high-grade and advanced prostate cancer.

Methods:   Collaborating investigators from 15 prospective studies provided individual-participant records (from predominantly men of white European ancestry) on blood or toenail selenium concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Odds ratios of prostate cancer by selenium concentration were estimated using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Blood selenium was not associated with the risk of total prostate cancer (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 80 percentile increase = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.23, based on 4527 case patients and 6021 control subjects). However, there was heterogeneity by disease aggressiveness (ie, advanced stage and/or prostate cancer death, Pheterogeneity = .01), with high blood selenium associated with a lower risk of aggressive disease (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.87) but not with nonaggressive disease.

EphA2 ""canonical"" signaling involves ephrin-A ligand binding, tyrosine autophosphorylation, and kinase activity; EphA2 ""noncanonical"" signaling involves phosphorylation of serine 897 (S897) by AKT and RSK kinases. To identify small molecules counteracting EphA2 canonical signaling, we developed a high-content screening platform measuring inhibition of ephrin-A1-induced PC3 prostate cancer cell retraction. Surprisingly, most hits from a screened collection of pharmacologically active compounds are agents that elevate intracellular cAMP by activating G protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenoceptor. We found that cAMP promotes phosphorylation of S897 by protein kinase A (PKA) as well as increases the phosphorylation of several nearby serine/threonine residues, which constitute a phosphorylation hotspot. Whereas EphA2 canonical and noncanonical signaling have been viewed as mutually exclusive, we show that S897 phosphorylation by PKA can coexist with EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and block cell retraction induced by EphA2 kinase activity.

Previously, we demonstrated that TMPRSS4 mediates tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. We also found that TMPRSS4 activates the transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) to induce cancer cell invasion. Here, we explored TMPRSS4-mediated cellular functions and the underlying mechanisms. TMPRSS4 induced Slug, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factor, and cyclin D1 through activation of AP-1, composed of c-Jun and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, which resulted in enhanced invasion and proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells. In PC3 cells, not only c-Jun but also Slug was required for TMPRSS4-mediated proliferation and invasion. Interestingly, Slug induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 to activate AP-1 through upregulation of Axl, establishing a positive feedback loop between Slug and AP-1, and thus induced cyclin D1, leading to enhanced proliferation. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that Slug expression positively correlated with that of c-Jun and cyclin D1 in human prostate cancers. Expression of Slug was positively correlated with that of cyclin D1 in various cancer cell lines, whereas expression of other EMT-inducing transcription factors was not. This study demonstrates that TMPRSS4 modulates both invasion and proliferation via Slug and cyclin D1, which is a previously unrecognized pathway that may regulate metastasis and cancer progression.""","""['Yunhee Lee', 'Dongjoon Ko', 'Hye-Jin Min', 'Sol Bi Kim', 'Hye-Mi Ahn', 'Younghoon Lee', 'Semi Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['TMPRSS4 promotes cancer stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells through upregulation of SOX2 by SLUG and TWIST1.', 'TMPRSS4 upregulates uPA gene expression through JNK signaling activation to induce cancer cell invasion.', 'TMPRSS4 promotes invasion, migration and metastasis of human tumor cells by facilitating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Role of TMPRSS4 during cancer progression.', 'TMPRSS4: an emerging potential therapeutic target in cancer.', 'TMPRSS4, a type II transmembrane serine protease, as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.', 'TMPRSS4 is a novel biomarker and correlated with immune infiltration in thyroid carcinoma.', 'TMPRSS4 promotes cancer stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells through upregulation of SOX2 by SLUG and TWIST1.', 'TMPRSS4 Promotes Cell Proliferation and Inhibits Apoptosis in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by Activating ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway.', 'The Role of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Axl in Carcinogenesis and Development of Therapeutic Resistance: An Overview of Molecular Mechanisms and Future Applications.']"""

In our study, we established a stable overexpressing AKR1C3 cell line (AKR1C3-over) derived from the prostate cell line DU145 and its control cell line (Control). We conducted colony formation assay to determine the role of AKR1C3 in radioresistance and we used its chemical inhibitor to detect whether it can restored the sensitivity of the acquired tumor cells. Flow cytometry assay was carried out to detect IR-induced ROS accumulation. Elisa was adopted to dedect the concentration of PGF2α in the suspension of the cells after 6GY radiation. Western blotting was used to dedect the MAPK and PPAR γ. The results demonstrated that overexpression of AKR1C3 in prostate cancer can result in radioresistance and suppression of AKR1C3 via its chemical inhibitor indocin restored the sensitivity of the acquired tumor cells. According to the flow cytometry assay, ROS was decreased by 80% in DU145-over cells.

We show here that i) compared to normal prostate tissue, Notch1 expression is significantly reduced in a substantial fraction of human PCas while it is unaffected or even increased in others; ii) acute Notch activation both inhibits and induces process networks associated with prostatic neoplasms; iii) down-modulation of Notch1 expression and activity in immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells increases their proliferation potential, while increased Notch1 activity in PCa cells suppresses growth and tumorigenicity through a Smad3-dependent mechanism involving p21WAF1/CIP1; iv) prostate cancer cells resistant to Notch growth inhibitory effects retain Notch1-induced upregulation of pro-oncogenic genes, like EPAS1 and CXCL6, also overexpressed in human PCas with high Notch1 levels.

We previously showed that lysine deacetylase sirtuin 1, SIRT1, promotes acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations in association with enhancing KU70 mediated non-homologous end joining DNA repair. In this study, we demonstrate that lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an opposite role to SIRT1 in regulating DNA repair and mutation acquisition. In response to therapeutic stress and DNA damage, LSD1 and SIRT1 compete for binding to KU70 on DNA damage foci globally and on the ABL locus. The recruitment of SIRT1 or LSD1 to KU70 impacts chromatin structure but does not correlate well with their direct histone modification functions, and SIRT1 helps maintain histone H4K16 acetylation and open chromatin for repair. The competitive KU70 binding by these proteins affects cancer cells' ability to repair broken DNA and acquire resistant genetic mutations in CML and prostate cancer cells. We identify that the core domain of KU70 binds both LSD1 and SIRT1, forming a molecular basis for the competition. The C-terminal SAP motif of KU70 mediates LSD1/SIRT1 competitive interaction by suppressing LSD1 binding to KU70 and ectopic expression of SAP-deleted KU70 to CML cells compromises their ability to acquire BCR-ABL mutations.

The platform was programmed to generate sinusoidal motion of the array. This motion was tracked using the real-time position management (RPM) system and four amplitude gating options were employed to interrupt MV beam delivery when the platform was not located within set limits. Time-resolved spatial information extracted from analysis of x-ray fluences measured by the array was compared to the programmed motion of the platform and to the trace recorded by the RPM system during the delivery of the x-ray field. Temporal data recorded by the phantom and the RPM system were validated against trajectory log files, recorded by the linac during the irradiation, as well as oscilloscope waveforms recorded from the linac target signal. Gamma analysis was employed to compare time-integrated 2D x-ray dose fluences with theoretical fluences derived from the probability density function for each of the gating settings applied, where gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm, 1%/1 mm and 0.5%/0.5 mm were used to evaluate the limitations of the RPM system. Excellent agreement was observed in the analysis of spatial information extracted from the SRS 1000 array measurements. Comparisons of the average platform position with the expected position indicated absolute deviations of <0.5 mm for all four gating settings. Differences were observed when comparing time-resolved beam-on data stored in the RPM files and trajectory logs to the true target signal waveforms. Trajectory log files underestimated the cycle time between consecutive beam-on windows by 10.0 ± 0.8 ms. All measured fluences achieved 100% pass-rates using gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 50% of the fluences achieved pass-rates >90% when criteria of 0.5%/0.5 mm were used.

Methods:   Between May 1998 and December 2011, 2237 patients with early-stage prostate cancer from 11 Italian community and academic hospitals were treated with iodine-125 ((125)I) or palladium-103 LDR-BT as monotherapy and followed up for at least 2 years. (125)I seeds were implanted in 97.7% of the patients: the mean dose received by 90% of target volume was 145 Gy; the mean target volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose (V100) was 91.1%. Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and multivariable Cox regression were used to evaluate the relationship of covariates with outcomes.  Results:   Median follow-up time was 65 months. 5- and 7-year DSS, OS and BFFS were 99 and 98%, 94 and 89%, and 92 and 88%, respectively.

Prostate tissue in needle biopsy expresses a wide variety of architectural patterns some of which are difficult to interpret. Immunohistochemical markers, such as AMACR, p63 and 34βE12 that are currently used in diagnosing prostate cancer, are of great value, but often their interpretation is ambiguous. In 2005 Tomlins et al. identified an emerging marker, erythroblastosis E26 rearrangement gene (ERG), which is a member of the family of genes encoding erythroblast-transformation specific transcription factors (ETS) with frequent expression in PC.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ERG in benign mimickers of PC in needle biopsies and its diagnostic value alone and in combination with AMACK and 34βE12.  Results:   Of the selected 46 biopsies, two were eventually diagnosed as PC Gleason score 6 as they were simultaneously ERG and AMACR-positive and 34βE12-negative. One case was considered atypical. The remaining 43 biopsies were diagnosed as benign cases: simple atrophy in 13 cases, partial atrophy in 11, adenosis in 9, basal cell hyperplasia in 3, post-atrophic hyperplasia in 3, clear cell hyperplasia in 2 and sclerotic adenosis in 2 cases. None of the 43 benign cores showed evidence of ERG expression.

As a result of this, we carried out this meta-analysis for the purpose of comparing the diagnostic accuracy among four PET/CT radiotracers.  Methods:   A systematical literature search for articles was performed until July 3, 2015. We implemented all analysis using the statistical software of STATA12 and quality assessment was performed using QUADAS-2.  Results:   A total of 56 studies containing 3,586 patients were included in this meta-analysis.

It is widely used in clinical practice for minimally invasive treatment of prostate cancer. Nonablative, low-power HIFU was established as a promising tool for triggering the release of chemotherapeutic drugs from temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs). In this study, we combine ablative HIFU and thermally triggered chemotherapy to address the lack of safe and effective treatment options for elderly patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. DU145 prostate cancer cells were exposed to chemotherapy (free and liposomal Sorafenib) and ablative HIFU, alone or in combination. Prior to cell viability assessment by trypan blue exclusion and flow cytometry, the uptake of TSLs by DU145 cells was verified by confocal microscopy and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). The combination of TSLs encapsulating 10 μM Sorafenib and 8.7W HIFU resulted in a viability of less than 10% at 72 h post-treatment, which was significant less than the viability of the cells treated with free Sorafenib (76%), Sorafenib-loaded TSLs (63%), or HIFU alone (44%).

Methods:   We performed mRNA expression profiling in 22Rv1 cells following 2.5 mM and 5 mM metformin treatment. Genes significantly modified by metformin treatment were ranked based on altered expression, involvement with cancer-related processes, and reported dysregulation in PCa. The effects of the top ranked gene, MMSET, on the proliferative and invasive capabilities of PCa cells were investigated via siRNA knockdown alone and also combined with metformin treatment.  Results:   Metformin treatment decreased cell growth of PCa cell line 22Rv1 and stalled cells at the G1/S checkpoint in a time- and dose-dependent manner, resulting in increased cells in G1 (P < 0.05) and decreased cells in S (P < 0.05) phase. Metformin activated the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway as shown by increased p-AMPK and decreased p-p70S6K. mRNA expression profiling following metformin treatment identified significant changes in 136 chromatin-modifying genes. The top ranked gene, multiple myeloma SET domain (MMSET) showed increased expression in PCa cell lines (22Rv1 and DU145) when compared to the benign prostate epithelium-derived cell-line RWPE-1, and its expression was decreased upon metformin treatment. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMSET showed decreased cellular migration and invasion in DU-145 cells. MMSET knockdown in combination with metformin treatment resulted in further reduction in the capacity of PCa cells to migrate and invade.  Conclusions:   These data suggest MMSET may play a role in the inhibitory effect of metformin on PCa and could serve as a potential novel therapeutic target for PCa.

Materials and methods:   Prospective and observational study of 474 men scheduled to repeated PBs. Assessment of PIA and its extension in the previous biopsy. PCa detection rate and tumor aggressiveness. Age, serum total PSA, free PSA, percent free PSA (%fPSA), digital rectal exam (DRE), prostate volume (PV), PSA density (PSAD), PSA kinetics (PSAV and PSADT) findings of PIA and HGPIN, and number of affected cores in previous PBs were included in the univariate and multivariate analysis. Aggressive tumors were considered when any Gleason pattern 4 was found.  Results:   PCa was detected in 133 men (28.1%). Age, serum total PSA, %fPSA, PV, PSAD, PSAV, PSADT, and PIA finding were significantly associated to PCa detection. However, only age, OR: 1.06 (95%CI: 1.03-1.10), P < 0.01; DRE, OR: 1.76 (95%CI: 1.05-2.92), P = 0.03; %fPSA, OR: 0.96 (95%CI: 0.93-0.99), P = 0.03; PV, OR: 0.98 (95%CI: 0.97-0.99) and PIA finding, OR: 0.49 (95%CI: 0.29-0.83), P < 0.01, were independent predictors of PCa detection. PCa was found in 18% of 159 men with previous PIA finding while in 33% of 315 men without previous PIA (P < 0.01). None of the studied parameters including PIA in the previous biopsy were related with subsequent PCa aggressiveness.  Conclusions:   PIA finding in negative biopsies correlates with a decreased frequency of detecting PCa in men with persistent suspicion of PCa.

An abnormal splice variant of the androgen receptor, AR-V7, was recently found to confer resistance to novel hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but did not negatively affect responses to taxane chemotherapies, suggesting that early use of chemotherapy may be a more effective option for AR-V7(+) patients.  Methods:   We calculated the cost savings of performing AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients prior to starting abiraterone/enzalutamide (and avoiding these drugs in AR-V7(+) men) versus treating all mCRPC patients empirically with abiraterone/enzalutamide (without use of the biomarker).  Results:   We determined that AR-V7 testing would result in substantial cost savings as long as the true prevalence of AR-V7 was >5%. In our prior studies, we estimated that approximately 30% of mCRPC patients may have detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In this population, upfront testing of AR-V7 status (at a price of $1,000 per test) would result in a net cost savings of $150 Million in the United States per year.  Conclusions:   AR-V7 testing in mCRPC patients would be cost-beneficial when considering the current price of treatment, and may reduce the ineffective use of abiraterone/enzalutamide, leading to a significant net cost savings to the healthcare system. Clinical-grade AR-V7 testing is currently available at our institution.

The drug loading, entrapment efficiency and structural changes of curcumin was confirmed by quantitative NMR spectroscopy. The nanoparticles prepared using the three ratios had an average diameters of 236.5±8.8, 212±3.4, and 187±11.4nm, as well as zeta (ζ) potentials of -13.1,-9.26, and -4.63mV, respectively, at pH 7.0. The cytotoxicity assay was performed for human colon and prostate cancer (SW480 and LNCap) by MTT assay and results showed significantly higher cytotoxicity of nanoencapsulated curcumin (NEC) (equivalent to 30.91, 20.70 and 16.86µM of NEC-1, 2 and 3 respectively), as compared to plain curcumin at 50µM after 72h of treatment. Cytotoxicity was also confirmed by microscopy of treated cells stained with acridine orange and propidium iodide. The cells treated with 50µM of curcumin, 30.91µM (NEC-1), 20.70µM (NEC-2) and 16.86µM (NEC-3) showed enhanced activation of p53 and elevated bax/Bcl2 expression (NEC-3), increased cytochrome-c in cytosol (NEC-2) confirming the enhanced cytotoxicity. To confirm the increased bioavailability, the intracellular curcumin was measured using fluorescence intensity. The fluorescent signal for intracellular curcumin was increased by 12, 30, and 21% for NEC-1, NEC-2, and NEC-3 respectively as compared to plain curcumin at 4h.

Results:   Our minimal model captures well the dynamics of the tumour after therapy, and suggests that a strong anti-tumour immune response coupled with the therapeutic effect of radiation on the tumour is responsible for the PSA bounce. Patients who experience a PSA bounce had a higher density of CD3 and CD8 cells within the tumour that likely contribute to the PSA bounce and the overall better outcomes observed.

Recent evidence supports a role for metformin in prostate cancer chemoprotection. However, whether metformin indeed influences prostate biology is unknown. We aimed to study the association between metformin and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels-the primary prostate cancer biomarker.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study of 326 prostate cancer-free men with type 2 diabetes were recruited between 2004 and 2013 at St. Michael's Hospital. Men were excluded if they had a PSA ≥10-ng/ml, or used >2,550-mg/d metformin or supplemental androgens. Multivariate linear regressions quantified the association between metformin dose and log-PSA. Secondary analyses quantified the association between other antihyperglycemics (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones) and PSA; sensitivity analyses tested covariate interactions.  Results:   Median PSA was 0.9-ng/ml (IQR: 0.5-1.6-ng/ml). Metformin dose associated positively with BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration, and number of statin, acetylsalicylic acid, diuretic users, and number of antihyperglycemics used, and negatively with LDL-C. In multivariate models, PSA changed by -8% (95%CI: -13 to -2%, P = 0.011) per 500-mg/d increase in metformin. Men with diabetes for ≥6 years (n = 163) saw a greater difference in PSA per 500-mg/d metformin (-12% [95% CI: -19 to -4%, P = 0.002], P-interaction = 0.018). Serum PSA did not relate with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or total number of antihyperglycemic agents used. Our findings are limited by the cross-sectional design of this study.  Conclusions:   Metformin dose-dependently inversely associated with serum PSA, independent of other antihyperglycemic medications.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether acylcarnitines accumulate in prostate cancer tissue, and whether their biological actions could be similar to those of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a structurally related compound associated with cancer development.  Methods:   Levels of palmitoylcarnitine (palcar), a C16:00 acylcarnitine, were measured in prostate tissue using LC-MS/MS. The effect of palcar on inflammatory cytokines and calcium (Ca(2+) ) influx was investigated in in vitro models of prostate cancer.  Results:   We observed a significantly higher level of palcar in prostate cancerous tissue compared to benign tissue. High levels of palcar have been associated with increased gene expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in cancerous PC3 cells, compared to normal PNT1A cells. Furthermore, we found that high levels of palcar induced a rapid Ca(2+) influx in PC3 cells, but not in DU145, BPH-1, or PNT1A cells. This pattern of Ca(2+) influx was also observed in response to DHT. Through the use of whole genome arrays we demonstrated that PNT1A cells exposed to palcar or DHT have a similar biological response.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that palcar might act as a potential mediator for prostate cancer progression through its effect on (i) pro-inflammatory pathways, (ii) Ca(2+) influx, and (iii) DHT-like effects. Further studies need to be undertaken to explore whether this class of compounds has different biological functions at physiological and pathological levels.

Inadequate delivery may have doomed otherwise effective drugs, through failure to distinguish drug inefficacy from poor distribution at the target. Conventional pretreatment clinical images of the patient fail to reveal the complexity and diversity of drug transport pathways in tissue. We discuss the richness of these pathways and argue that development and patient treatment can be sped up and improved by: using quantitative as well as 'real-time' imaging; customized simulations using data from that imaging; and device designs that optimize the drug-device combination.""","""['Raghu Raghavan', 'Martin L Brady', 'John H Sampson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Ther Deliv""","""['Future of convection-enhanced delivery in the treatment of brain tumors.', 'Minimally invasive procedures.

Two commonly studied types of phenotypic plasticity are epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). In carcinomas, EMT drives invasion and metastatic dissemination, while MET is proposed to play a role in metastatic colonization. Phenotypic plasticity in sarcomas is not well studied; however, there is evidence that a subset of sarcomas undergo an MET-like phenomenon. While the exact mechanisms by which these transitions occur remain largely unknown, it is likely that some of the same master regulators that drive EMT and MET in carcinomas also act in sarcomas. In this study, we combined mathematical models with bench experiments to identify a core regulatory circuit that controls MET in sarcomas. This circuit comprises the microRNA 200 (miR-200) family, ZEB1, and GRHL2. Interestingly, combined expression of miR-200s and GRHL2 further upregulates epithelial genes to induce MET. This effect is phenocopied by downregulation of either ZEB1 or the ZEB1 cofactor, BRG1. In addition, an MET gene expression signature is prognostic for improved overall survival in sarcoma patients. Together, our results suggest that a miR-200, ZEB1, GRHL2 gene regulatory network may drive sarcoma cells to a more epithelial-like state and that this likely has prognostic relevance.""","""['Jason A Somarelli', 'Samantha Shetler', 'Mohit K Jolly', 'Xueyang Wang', 'Suzanne Bartholf Dewitt', 'Alexander J Hish', 'Shivee Gilja', 'William C Eward', 'Kathryn E Ware', 'Herbert Levine', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Mariano A Garcia-Blanco']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Induction of Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transitions in Sarcoma Cells.', 'The GRHL2/ZEB Feedback Loop-A Key Axis in the Regulation of EMT in Breast Cancer.', 'GRHL2-miR-200-ZEB1 maintains the epithelial status of ovarian cancer through transcriptional regulation and histone modification.', 'The Functions of MicroRNA-200 Family in Ovarian Cancer: Beyond Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'The Role of MicroRNA in the Regulation of Tumor Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Synthetic Epigenetic Reprogramming of Mesenchymal to Epithelial States Using the CRISPR/dCas9 Platform in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Dynamics of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity: What Have Single-Cell Investigations Elucidated So Far?', 'The ELF3 transcription factor is associated with an epithelial phenotype and represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Epigenetic memory acquired during long-term EMT induction governs the recovery to the epithelial state.', 'Reversion of methionine addiction of osteosarcoma cells to methionine independence results in loss of malignancy, modulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype and alteration of histone-H3 lysine-methylation.']"""

Silibinin exerts strong antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Many studies have shown that silibinin inhibits experimentally induced malignancies of the liver, prostate, skin, and colon as well as promotes inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cell lines in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the effects of silibinin on the human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 in monolayer and spheroid cultures.  Method:   The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines were cultured in both monolayer and spheroid cultures. Cells were treated with silibinin at 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling index was used to determine the cells of the synthesis phase. Poly-ADP-ribose-polimerase immunohistochemical staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling assay were used to determine the death of cells in both the monolayer and spheroid cultures.  Results:   An half maximal inhibitory concentration dose of silibinin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was 100 µM/mL at 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling positive cells and active poly-ADP-ribose-polimerase were detected after treatment with silibinin in both the monolayer and spheroid cultures. The dead cell count was higher in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines with silibinin applied than in the controls.

Materials and methods:   The CHOosIng Treatment for Prostate CanCEr (CHOICE) study was an Italian multicenter, cross-sectional study conducted from December 2010 to January 2012. A total of 1386 patients treated with ADT for PCa (first prescription or renewal of ADT) were selected. According to EAU guidelines, the cohort was categorized in discordant ADT (Group A) and concordant ADT (Group B). The prevalence of CVD and osteoporosis after ADT was recorded.  Results:   The final cohort included 1075 patients. According to EAU guidelines adherence, 285 (26.51%) and 790 (73.49%) were considered discordant and concordant, respectively. The proportion of men with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 2 at baseline was statistically similar in Group A (81.8%) compared to Group B (80.8%) (P = .96). The number of complications reported at enrollment was as follows: cardiovascular in 351 (32.7%), endocrine in 166 (15.4%), sexual in 498 (46.3%), osteoporosis in 181 (16.8%), and gynecomastia in 274 (25.5%) subjects. At the multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors, discordant ADT was associated with greater risk of cardiovascular complications (odds ratio: 2.07; P < .01) and osteoporosis (odds ratio: 1.75; P = .04).

In trial COU-AA-302 (chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC), abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA) significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) when compared to placebo plus prednisone (P).  Objective:   This post hoc analysis investigated clinical responses to docetaxel as first subsequent therapy (FST) among patients who progressed following protocol-specified treatment with AA, and characterized subsequent treatment patterns among older (≥75 yr) and younger (<75 yr) patient subgroups.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were collected at the final OS analysis (96% of expected death events). Subsequent therapy data were prospectively collected, while response and discontinuation data were collected retrospectively following discontinuation of the study drug.  Intervention:   At the discretion of the investigator, 67% (365/546) of patients from the AA arm received subsequent treatment with one or more agents approved for mCRPC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Efficacy analysis was performed for patients for whom baseline and at least one post-baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were available.  Results and limitations:   Baseline and at least one post-baseline PSA values were available for 100 AA patients who received docetaxel as FST. While acknowledging the limitations of post hoc analyses, 40% (40/100) of these patients had an unconfirmed ≥50% PSA decline with first subsequent docetaxel therapy, and 27% (27/100) had a confirmed ≥50% PSA decline. The median docetaxel treatment duration among these 100 patients was 4.2 mo. Docetaxel was the most common FST among older and younger patients from each treatment arm. However, 43% (79/185) of older patients who progressed on AA received no subsequent therapy for mCRPC, compared with 17% (60/361) of younger patients.  Conclusions:   Patients with mCRPC who progress with AA treatment may still derive benefit from subsequent docetaxel therapy. These data support further assessment of treatment patterns following AA treatment for mCRPC, particularly among older patients.  Trial registration:   ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00887198.  Patient summary:   Treatment patterns for advanced prostate cancer have changed substantially in the last few years.

Both markers were evaluated in 12 samples of canine benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 17 canine prostatic carcinomas (PCs) by immunohistochemistry, to understand their possible role in canine prostate carcinogenesis. STAT3 was expressed in 25% and 82.35% of BPH and PC, respectively, with a significantly higher number of STAT3-positive cells in malignant compared with hyperplastic lesions. Three PCs had occasional nuclear expression of STAT3. PTEN was expressed in BPH and PC with a similar distribution and percentage of positive cells; however, four PCs were PTEN negative. Solid PCs contained more STAT3-positive and fewer PTEN-positive cells compared with the other subtypes. A reduced number of PTEN-positive cells was observed in PCs with a high Gleason score (GS10), while no association was demonstrated between STAT3 expression and Gleason score. The data suggest that overexpression of STAT3 and downregulation of PTEN may be an important step in canine prostate carcinogenesis and both markers may be related to the histological subtypes of PC and the degree of differentiation of neoplastic cells.""","""['H-Y Lin', 'C Palmieri']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Comp Pathol""","""['Heat shock protein 90 is associated with hyperplasia and neoplastic transformation of canine prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Alterations in PTEN, MDM2, TP53 and AR protein and gene expression are associated with canine prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Altered expression of p53, but not Rb, is involved in canine prostatic carcinogenesis.', 'Histochemical studies of epithelial cell glycoconjugates in atrophic, metaplastic, hyperplastic, and neoplastic canine prostate.', 'Histopathological Terminology Standards for the Reporting of Prostatic Epithelial Lesions in Dogs.', 'Comparative oncology: overcoming human cancer through companion animal studies.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'P-Glycoprotein and Androgen Receptor Expression Reveals Independence of Canine Prostate Cancer from Androgen Hormone Stimulation.', 'Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and chronic lung disease: caveolin-1 dysfunction an important underlying feature.']"""

Materials and methods:   The medical records of 1094 men who underwent RALP from January 2007 to March 2013 were analyzed using our database to identify 641 additional men without IPP (non-IPP group). We excluded 259 patients who presented insufficient data and 14 patients who did not have an MRI image. We compared the following parameters: preoperative transrectal ultrasound, prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinicopathologic characteristics, intraoperative characteristics, postoperative oncologic characteristics, minor and major postoperative complications, and continence until postoperative 1 year. IPP grade was stratified by grade into three groups: Grade 1 (IPP≤5 mm), Grade 2 (5 mm<IPP≤10 mm), and Grade 3 (IPP>10 mm).  Results:   Of the 821 patients who underwent RALP, 557 (67.8%) experienced continence at postoperative 3 months, 681 (82.9%) at 6 months, and 757 (92.2%) at 12 months. According to IPP grade, there were significant differences in recovering full continence at postoperative 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, IPP was the most powerful predictor of postoperative continence in patients who underwent RALP (p<0.001). Using a generalized estimating equation model, IPP also was shown to be the most powerful independent variable for postoperative continence in patients who underwent RALP (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   Patients with low-grade IPP have significantly higher chances of recovering full continence. Therefore, the known IPP grade will be helpful during consultations with patients before RALP.""","""['Jung Ki Jo', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok Soo Byun', 'Homayoun Zargar', 'Riccardo Autorino', 'Sang Eun Lee']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Yonsei Med J""","""['Intravesical prostatic protrusion may affect early postoperative continence undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Appropriate preoperative membranous urethral length predicts recovery of urinary continence after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Intravesical prostatic protrusion as a predictor of early urinary continence recovery after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical impact of the intravesical prostatic protrusion: a review by the LUTS committee of the French Urological Association.', 'Technical Tips in Managing Large Median Lobes During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Peritumoral Delivery of Docetaxel-TIPS Microparticles for Prostate Cancer Adjuvant Therapy.', 'Intravesical prostatic protrusion may affect early postoperative continence undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer imaging findings and implications for treatment from the surgical perspective.', 'Clinical Considerations for Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion in the Evaluation and Management of Bladder Outlet Obstruction Secondary to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.']"""

Considering the potential existence of androgen receptors that remain active at this stage, we aimed to assess the impact of the combined use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with DTX for mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   We performed a single-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with mCRPC who received either DTX alone (DTX group, n=21) or concurrent DTX and ADT (DTX+ADT group, n=26) between August 2006 and February 2014. All patients received DTX doses of 75 mg/m² every three weeks for at least three cycles. In the DTX+ADT group, all patients used luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist continuously as a concurrent ADT.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 24.0 months (interquartile range 12.0-37.0) for the entire cohort. The median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 9.0 months and 6.0 months in the DTX+ADT and DTX groups, respectively (log-rank p=0.036). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, concurrent administration of ADT was the only significant predictor of rPFS [hazard ratio (HR)=0.525, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.284-0.970, p=0.040]. The median OS was 42.0 and 38.0 months in the DTX+ADT and DTX groups, respectively (log-rank p=0.796). On multivariable analysis, hemoglobin level at the time of DTX initiation was associated with OS (HR=0.532, 95% CI 0.381-0.744, p<0.001).  Conclusion:   In chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC, the combined use of ADT with DTX improved rPFS.

We evaluated the correlation between digital image analysis (continuous variable data) and pathologist visual scoring (quasi-continuous variable data), reproducibility of each method, and association of digital image analysis methods with outcomes using prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) stained for estrogen receptor-β2 (ERβ2).  Methods:   Prostate cancer TMAs were digitized and evaluated by pathologist visual scoring versus digital image analysis for ERβ2 staining within tumor epithelium. Two independent analysis runs were performed to evaluate reproducibility. Image analysis data were evaluated for associations with recurrence-free survival and disease specific survival following radical prostatectomy.  Results:   We observed weak/moderate Spearman correlation between digital image analysis and pathologist visual scores of tumor nuclei (Analysis Run A: 0.42, Analysis Run B: 0.41), and moderate/strong correlation between digital image analysis and pathologist visual scores of tumor cytoplasm (Analysis Run A: 0.70, Analysis Run B: 0.69). For the reproducibility analysis, there was high Spearman correlation between pathologist visual scores generated for individual TMA spots across Analysis Runs A and B (Nuclei: 0.84, Cytoplasm: 0.83), and very high correlation between digital image analysis for individual TMA spots across Analysis Runs A and B (Nuclei: 0.99, Cytoplasm: 0.99). Further, ERβ2 staining was significantly associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when quantified by cytoplasmic digital image analysis (HR 2.16, 95 % CI 1.02-4.57, p = 0.045), nuclear image analysis (HR 2.67, 95 % CI 1.20-5.96, p = 0.016), and total malignant epithelial area analysis (HR 5.10, 95 % CI 1.70-15.34, p = 0.004). After adjusting for clinicopathologic factors, only total malignant epithelial area ERβ2 staining was significantly associated with PCSM (HR 4.08, 95 % CI 1.37-12.15, p = 0.012).

In this study, we assess the assumption that the maximum cancer Gleason grade (Gleason grade hotspot) lies within the maximum dimension (volume hotspot) of a prostate cancer lesion.  Methods:   3-D histopathological models were reconstructed using the outputs of the 5-mm transperineal mapping (TPM) biopsies used as the reference test in the pilot phase of Prostate Mri Imaging Study (PROMIS), a paired validating cohort study investigating the performance of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) against transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies. The prostate was fully sampled with 5 mm intervals; each core was separately labelled, inked and orientated in space to register 3-D cancer lesions location. The data from the histopathology results were used to create a 3-D interpolated reconstruction of each lesion and identify the spatial coordinates of the largest dimension (volume hot spot) and highest Gleason grade (Gleason grade hotspot) and assess their concordance.  Results:   Ninety-four men, with median age 62 years (interquartile range, IQR= 58-68) and median PSA 6.5 ng ml(-1) (4.6-8.8), had a median of 80 (I69-89) cores each with a median of 4.5 positive cores (0-12). In the primary analysis, the prevalence of homogeneous lesions was 148 (76%; 95% confidence interval (CI) ±6.0%). In all, 184 (94±3.2%) lesions showed concordant hotspots and 11/47 (23±12.1%) of heterogeneous lesions showed discordant hotspots. The median 3-D distance between discordant hotspots was 12.8 mm (9.9-15.5). These figures remained stable on secondary analyses using alternative reconstructive assumptions. Limitations include a certain degree of error within reconstructed models.  Conclusions:   Guiding one biopsy needle to the maximum cancer diameter would lead to correct Gleason grade attribution in 94% of all lesions and 79% of heterogeneous ones if a true hit was obtained.

We investigated the potential association between total and dietary antioxidant intake and prostate cancer in a Swedish population.  Methods:   We used FFQ data from 1499 cases and 1112 controls in the population based case-control study Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS). The ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay was used to assess the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of diet and supplements. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of prostate cancer across quintiles of antioxidant intake from all foods, from fruit and vegetables only, and from dietary supplements using unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   Coffee comprised 62 % of the dietary antioxidant intake, tea 4 %, berries 4 %, chocolate 2 %, and boiled potatoes 2 %. In total 19 % and 13 % of the population took multivitamins and supplemental Vitamin C respectively, on a regular basis. Antioxidant intake from all foods and from fruits and vegetables separately measured by the FRAP assay was not associated with prostate cancer risk.

This prospective single-arm open-label phase II study was conducted to evaluate MC regimen in patients with biochemical recurrent PC. MC was planned to be administered orally at a daily dose of 50 mg for 6 months. Primary endpoint was PSA response. Thirty-eight patients were included and treated.

Response rate was 5 % with one complete response (2.6 %), and 1 partial response with PSA decrease >50 % (2.6 %). The median time until androgen deprivation therapy initiation was around 15 months. The treatment was well tolerated. Neither grade 3-4 toxicity nor serious adverse events were observed. This first prospective clinical trial with MC therapy in patients with non-metastatic biochemical recurrence of PC displayed modest efficacy when measured with PSA response rate, without significant toxicity.

A total of 10 patients with localized prostate cancer were selected for this study. VMAT, HDR brachytherapy, and LDR permanent seeds implant plans were created for each patient. For VMAT, planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the clinical target volume plus a margin of 5mm. Rectum, bladder, urethra, and femoral heads were considered as organs at risk. A 78Gy in 39 fractions were prescribed for PTV. For HDR and LDR plans, the dose prescription was D90 of 34Gy in 8.5Gy per fraction, and 145Gy to clinical target volume, respectively. The dose and dose volume parameters were evaluated for target, organs at risk, and normal tissue. Physical dose was converted to dose based on 2-Gy fractions (equivalent dose in 2Gy per fraction, EQD2) for comparison of 3 techniques. HDR and LDR significantly reduced the dose to rectum and bladder compared with VMAT. The Dmean (EQD2) of rectum decreased 22.36Gy in HDR and 17.01Gy in LDR from 30.24Gy in VMAT, respectively. The Dmean (EQD2) of bladder decreased 6.91Gy in HDR and 2.53Gy in LDR from 13.46Gy in VMAT. For the femoral heads and normal tissue, the mean doses were also significantly reduced in both HDR and LDR compared with VMAT.

Nevertheless many patients suffered from biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Mounting evidence suggest that estrogen and xenobiotic carcinogens play an essential role in progression of prostate cancervia oxidative estrogen metabolism. CYP1B1 is an enzyme involved in the hydroxylation of estrogens, a reaction of key relevance in estrogen metabolism. Given the role of CYP1B1 in the oxidative metabolism of endogenous/exogenous estrogen and compounds, CYP1B1 polymorphisms have the potential to modify its expression and subsequently lead to progression. We hypothesize that genetic variants of the CYP1B1 gene may influence clinical outcome in clinically localized prostate cancer patients. In this cohort study, we genotyped 9 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the CYP1B1 gene in 312 patients treated with RP. For replication, these SNPs were genotyped in an independent cohort of 426 patients. The expression level of CYP1B1 in the adjacent normal prostate tissues was quantified by reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to identify SNPs that correlated with BCR. CYP1B1 rs1056836 was significantly associated with BCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.89, P = 0.002) and relative CYP1B1 mRNA expression.

This may contribute to the improvement of cancer surveillance processes in individual transplant centers.  Patients and methods:   1655 patients after kidney transplantation at our institution with a total of 9,425 person-years of follow-up were compared retrospectively to the general German population using site-specific standardized-incidence-ratios (SIRs) of observed malignancies. Risk-adjusted multivariable Cox regression was used to identify independent pre-transplant cancer risk factors. G-chart analysis was applied to determine relevant differences in the frequency of cancer occurrences.  Results:   Cancer incidence rates were almost three times higher as compared to the matched general population (SIR = 2.75; 95%-CI: 2.33-3.21). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for renal cell carcinoma (SIR = 22.46), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (SIR = 8.36), prostate cancer (SIR = 2.22), bladder cancer (SIR = 3.24), thyroid cancer (SIR = 10.13) and melanoma (SIR = 3.08). Independent pre-transplant risk factors for cancer-free survival were age <52.3 years (p = 0.007, Hazard ratio (HR): 0.82), age >62.6 years (p = 0.001, HR: 1.29), polycystic kidney disease other than autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (p = 0.001, HR: 0.68), high body mass index in kg/m2 (p<0.001, HR: 1.04), ADPKD (p = 0.008, HR: 1.26) and diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.004, HR = 1.51). G-chart analysis identified relevant changes in the detection rates of cancer during aftercare with no significant relation to identified risk factors for cancer-free survival (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Risk-adapted cancer surveillance combined with prospective G-chart analysis likely improves cancer surveillance schemes by adapting processes to identified risk factors and by using G-chart alarm signals to trigger Kaizen events and audits for root-cause analysis of relevant detection rate changes.

This study describes the impact of self-reported local (erectile, bowel, urinary dysfunction) or systemic (mental distress, fatigue, virility loss) AEs on QoL reduction.  Materials and methods:   Nordic PCa patients completed a questionnaire containing 84 multiple-choice questions. The main outcome variable of the survey was patient-reported PCa-induced QoL reduction, assessed by descriptive and regression analyses. The level of significance was p < 0.05.  Results:   Among 6200 patients, 39% described their QoL as reduced owing to the PCa trajectory: radical prostatectomy group (RPGroup): 42%, radiotherapy without hormones (RADGroup): 27%, hormones (HormGroup): 47% and no treatment (NoTrtGroup): 19%. Except for the NoTrtGroup, urinary leakage and fatigue doubled the risk of QoL reduction, while virility loss and erectile dysfunction tripled the risk. Significant intergroup differences emerged for the age-adjusted odds of QoL reduction: RPGroup (0.66), RADGroup (0.40), HormGroup (0.95) and NoTrtGroup (0.22).  Conclusions:   After RP, RAD or hormone treatment of PCa, systemic AEs, in particular loss of virility, significantly reduce PCa patients' QoL similarly to or more than local AEs. The probability of reduced QoL is highest during hormone treatment and lowest in patients without anticancer therapy, and seems lower in patients treated with RAD without hormones than after RP. The treatment-related risk of reduced QoL due to systemic AEs should become a part of the pretreatment counselling of patients.""","""['Sophie D Fosså', 'Thomas Bengtsson', 'Michael Borre', 'Göran Ahlgren', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Alv A Dahl']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['A national study of adverse effects and global quality of life among candidates for curative treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of age on quality-of-life outcomes after treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Global Quality of Life After Curative Treatment for Prostate Cancer: What Matters?

Gratifyingly, the compounds 5j, 5o and 5r exhibited potent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) with IC50 values in the range of 1.26-2.77μM, and are found to be safer with lesser cytotoxicity on normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Further, experiments were conducted with these compounds 5j, 5o and 5r on MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to study the mechanism of growth inhibition and apoptosis inducing effect. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with test compounds resulted in inhibition of cell migration through disorganization and disruption of F-actin capping protein.

Methods:   We identified all patients >75 years diagnosed with PCa, BCa, and RCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare registry during 1992-2009. We analyzed the comorbidity and trends in radical cystectomy (RC), nephrectomy, and radical prostatectomy (RP) for these cohorts. Predictive factors for receiving aggressive surgery were assessed using logistic regression analysis.  Results:   We identified cohorts of 85,073 PCa, 44,801 BCa, and 10,737 RCC patients. Among the BCa patients, 5.75% underwent RC and 78.2% had a Charlson comorbidity score (CCS) of ≤1. The trend of RC did not change significantly. There was a significant change in receipt of RP (P = .01). There were 85.8% of PCa patients who had a CCS ≤1 and 2.67% underwent RP. Approximately 65.2% of RCC patients had nephrectomy whereas 76.2% had CCS of ≤1. There was a decline in receipt of nephrectomies (P < .0001). Younger age, high stage or grade disease, and lower comorbidity were associated with higher odds of receiving RC, RP, and nephrectomy.

The purpose of this study was to determine if morphologies of Gleason pattern 4 PCa may predict upgrading and/or upstaging after radical prostatectomy (RP). A database search for men with GS 3 + 4 = 7 PCa diagnosed on TRUS-guided biopsy that underwent RP between January 2010 and October 2015 identified 152 patients. Two blinded genitourinary pathologists independently reviewed the biopsies and assessed ill-defined glands (IDG), fused glands, small or large cribriform patterns, and glomerulations. Patient age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage (%) of biopsy sites involved by 3 + 4 = 7 PCa, and overall extent of pattern 4 were also recorded. GS and stage (presence or absence of extraprostatic extension [EPE]) were retrieved from RP reports. Data were compared using independent t tests and chi-square. Inter-observer agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Percent of biopsy sites and extent of pattern 4 were compared to statistically significant morphologies using the Spearman correlation. 28.3 % (43/152) of patients were upgraded to GS >3 + 4 = 7 at RP (GS 4 + 3 = 7 [N = 17], GS 4 + 3 = 7 with tertiary pattern 5 [N = 25], and GS 4 + 5 = 9 [N = 1]) and 44.1 % (67/152) showed EPE after RP. PSA was associated with both upgrading (8.5 ± 5.4 vs. 6.9 ± 3.2 ng/mL, [p = 0.04]) and EPE (8.2 ± 4.6 vs. 6.7 ± 3.2 ng/mL, [p = 0.03]). IDG, fused glands, and glomerulations were not associated with upgrading or EPE (p > 0.05) with moderate to strong inter-observer agreement (K = 0.76-0.88). There was strong inter-observer agreement for small and large cribriform formations (K = 0.93 and 0.94, respectively) and both patterns were strongly associated with upgrading (p < 0.001) and EPE (p = 0.02) on RP. Strong associations were observed between increasing number of morphologies and both upgrading (p = 0.0.25) and EPE (p < 0.001). Overall extent of pattern 4 was associated with upgrading (p = 0.009) and EPE (p = 0.019) while percent of sites involved by GS 3 + 4 = 7 was only associated with EPE (p = 0.023). Cribriform morphology correlated to percentage of sites with 3 + 4 and overall extent of pattern 4 (rho = 0.25, p = 0.002, rho = 0.20, p = 0.015, respectively). Presence of cribriform morphology on TRUS-guided biopsy is strongly associated with upgrading and upstaging at RP and shows near-perfect inter-observer agreement whereas IDG, fused glands, and glomerulations were not useful.

Quantile discretization (QD) maps expression values for a sample into a series of equivalently sized 'bins' that represent a discrete numerical range, e.g. [Formula: see text]4 to [Formula: see text]4, which enables normalized data from multiple experiments and/or expression platforms to be combined for re-analysis. We found, however, that informal selection of bin numbers often resulted in loss of the underlying correlation structure in the data through assigning of the same numerical value to genes that are in reality expressed at significantly different levels within a sample. Here we report a procedure for determining an optimal bin number for dataset. Applying this to integrated public breast cancer datasets enabled statistical identification of several differentially expressed tumorigenesis-related genes that were not found when analyzing the individual datasets, and also several cancer biomarkers not previously indicated as having utility in the disease. Notably, differential modulation of translational control and protein synthesis via multiple pathways were found to potentially have central roles in breast cancer development and progression.

Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were executed to further confirm the c-Met/STAT3 signaling inhibition by heteronemin in DU145 and PC-3 cells.  Results:   In this study, we employed the virtual screening strategy to identify heteronemin, a spongean sesterterpene, as a potential STAT3 inhibitor from Taiwan marine drugs library. Application of heteronemin potently suppressed the viability and anchorage-independent growth of human prostate cancer cells. Besides, heteronemin induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by activation of both intrinsic (caspase-9) and extrinsic (caspase-8) apoptotic pathways. By luciferase assay and expression analysis, it was confirmed that heteronemin inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met/src/STAT3 signaling axis, STAT3-driven luciferase activities and expression of STAT3-regulated genes including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1. Finally, heteronemin effectively antagonized the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated c-Met/STAT3 activation as well as the proliferation and colonies formation in refractory prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that heteronemin may constitute a novel c-Met/STAT3-targeting agent for prostate cancer.

Mining this data often results in two crucial bottlenecks: 1) high dimensionality of features used to represent rich biological data and 2) small amounts of labelled training data due to the expense of consulting highly specific medical expertise necessary to assess each study. Currently, no approach that we are aware of has attempted to use active learning in the context of dimensionality reduction approaches for improving the construction of low dimensional representations. We present our novel methodology, AdDReSS (Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction with Semi-Supervision), to demonstrate that fewer labeled instances identified via AL in embedding space are needed for creating a more discriminative embedding representation compared to randomly selected instances. We tested our methodology on a wide variety of domains ranging from prostate gene expression, ovarian proteomic spectra, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and breast histopathology. Across these various high dimensional biomedical datasets with 100+ observations each and all parameters considered, the median classification accuracy across all experiments showed AdDReSS (88.7%) to outperform SSAGE, a SSDR method using random sampling (85.5%), and Graph Embedding (81.5%). Furthermore, we found that embeddings generated via AdDReSS achieved a mean 35.95% improvement in Raghavan efficiency, a measure of learning rate, over SSAGE. Our results demonstrate the value of AdDReSS to provide low dimensional representations of high dimensional biomedical data while achieving higher classification rates with fewer labelled examples as compared to without active learning.""","""['George Lee', 'David Edmundo Romo Bucheli', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Consensus embedding: theory, algorithms and application to segmentation and classification of biomedical data.', 'Dimensionality reduction-based fusion approaches for imaging and non-imaging biomedical data: concepts, workflow, and use-cases.', 'Semi supervised multi kernel (SeSMiK) graph embedding: identifying aggressive prostate cancer via magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.', 'Machine learning for detection and diagnosis of disease.', 'Integrated diagnostics: a conceptual framework with examples.', 'Data Mining Approach for Extraction of Useful Information About Biologically Active Compounds from Publications.', 'High-throughput adaptive sampling for whole-slide histopathology image analysis (HASHI) via convolutional neural networks: Application to invasive breast cancer detection.']"""

As one epigenetic regulation mechanism, DNA methylation of the whole genome and specific gene(s) plays critical roles in pathogenesis, progression, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer. The E-Cadherin gene is involved in cell metabolism and has been suggested to be related with malignancy of multiple tumors. This study investigated the correlation between E-Cadherin methylation and malignancy of prostate cancer. Gradient concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR (5, 10, and 20 mM) were used to treat the prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP), and mRNA level of E-Cadherin was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 82 prostate cancer patients were recruited to detect the methylation status of the promoter region of the E-Cadherin gene by pyrophosphate sequencing. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to determine mRNA levels of E-Cadherin. Methylation and mRNA levels of E-Cadherin were analyzed by the SPSS software. With elevated concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR, mRNA levels of E-Cadherin gradually increased. DNA methylation levels of tumor tissues were significantly elevated with increased Gleason score (P < 0.05) and tumor-node-metastasis stage (P < 0.05) but were not related to age, smoking habits, or alcohol consumption (P > 0.05). DNA methylation level was negatively correlated with mRNA expression of the E-Cadherin gene. Methylation in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in tumor adjacent tissues (P < 0.05).

PCa patients who have undergone curative treatment or endocrine therapy require long-term follow-up. Until recently, follow-up has primarily been managed by urologists at hospital-based outpatient clinics. However, new organizational strategies are needed to meet the needs of the growing number of elderly, comorbid cancer patients. These new organizational strategies target patients, GPs and specialists as joint stakeholders in the care and management of PCa.  Materials and methods:   In this 3 year follow-up to a Danish shared care PCa trial, 530 patients, out of a total of 2585 patients, were outsourced to the GPs. Strict evaluation criteria were selected to assess compliance according to individually agreed follow-up and re-referral plans for patients and GPs, respectively.  Results:   This study included 426 (80.4%) out of the 530 PCa patients. Among these, 196 patients had initially undergone curative-intended treatment, whereas 230 patients underwent non-curative treatment. Ninety-one deaths occurred during the study period.

In addition, a PREX1 gene signature correlated with and was dependent on ERK MAPK activation in human melanoma cell lines. In the current study, the underlying mechanism of PREX1 overexpression in human melanoma was assessed. PREX1 protein levels were increased in melanoma tumor tissues and cell lines compared with benign nevi and normal melanocytes, respectively. Suppression of PREX1 by siRNA impaired invasion but not proliferation in vitro PREX1-dependent invasion was attributable to PREX1-mediated activation of the small GTPase RAC1 but not the related small GTPase CDC42. Pharmacologic inhibition of ERK signaling reduced PREX1 gene transcription and additionally regulated PREX1 protein stability. This ERK-dependent upregulation of PREX1 in melanoma, due to both increased gene transcription and protein stability, contrasts with the mechanisms identified in breast and prostate cancers, in which PREX1 overexpression was driven by gene amplification and HDAC-mediated gene transcription, respectively. Thus, although PREX1 expression is aberrantly upregulated and regulates RAC1 activity and invasion in these three different tumor types, the mechanisms of its upregulation are distinct and context dependent.  Implications:   This study identifies an ERK-dependent mechanism that drives PREX1 upregulation and subsequent RAC1-dependent invasion in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma.

Our aims were to identify prognostic factors for late biochemical recurrence, including cancer family history, and evaluate cancer specific mortality.  Materials and methods:   We identified 10,310 patients after radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy between 1979 and 2015 in the prospective German Familial Prostate Cancer database. A subgroup of 2,480 patients with more than 10 years of followup (median 12.8) had undetectable prostate specific antigen. Biochemical recurrence, defined as prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or greater, developing at more than 10 years was defined as late biochemical recurrence. Multiple proportional hazards regression with forward selection was applied to determine prognostic factors for late biochemical recurrence.  Results:   The Kaplan-Meier estimated biochemical recurrence rate at 10, 15 and 20 years was 34.3%, 44.0% and 52.7%, respectively. Of 2,480 patients with undetectable prostate specific antigen 10 years postoperatively 249 subsequently had biochemical recurrence, of whom 12 died of prostate cancer. The factors associated with late biochemical recurrence were age at surgery (HR 1.04 per year, p = 0.027), prostate specific antigen at diagnosis (HR 1.02 per ng/ml, p = 0.020), pathological Gleason score (categorical 2-6 vs 7 [3 + 4], 7, 7 [4 + 3] and 8-10, p = 0.002) and pathological tumor stage pT3a or greater (HR 1.50, p = 0.065).  Conclusions:   From years 10 to 15 and 10 to 20 postoperatively the biochemical recurrence rate increased by 9.7% and 18.4%, respectively. In contrast to a family history of prostate cancer, age at surgery, prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, pathological tumor stage and pathological Gleason score were prognostic factors for late biochemical recurrence.

However, the lack of specificity has led to overdiagnosis, resulting in many possibly unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment. Therefore, novel serological biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity are of vital importance needed to complement PSA testing in the early diagnosis and effective management of PCa. This is particularly critical in the context of PCa health disparities, where early detection and management could help reduce the disproportionately high PCa mortality observed in African-American men. Previous studies have demonstrated that sera from patients with PCa contain autoantibodies that react with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs).  Methods:   The serological proteome analysis (SERPA) approach was used to identify tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) of PCa. In evaluation study, the level of anti-NPM1 antibody was examined in sera from test cohort, validation cohort, as well as European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) men with PCa by using immunoassay.  Results:   Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) as a 33 kDa TAA in PCa was identified and characterized by SERPA approach. Anti-NPM1 antibody level in PCa was higher than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy individuals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed similar high diagnostic value for PCa in the test cohort (area under the curve (AUC):0.860) and validation cohort (AUC: 0.822) to differentiate from normal individuals and BPH. Interestingly, AUC values were significantly higher for AA PCa patients. When considering concurrent serum measurements of anti-NPM1 antibody and PSA, 97.1% PCa patients at early stage were identified correctly, while 69.2% BPH patients who had elevated PSA levels were found to be anti-NPM1 negative. Additionally, anti-NPM1 antibody levels in PCa patients at early stage significantly increased after surgery treatment.

Here, we examined effects of the PDE10-selective inhibitor TC-E 5005 on smooth muscle contraction in human prostate tissue.  Methods:   Prostate samples were obtained from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Expression of PDE10 was addressed by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescence staining with different markers. Effects of TC-E 5005 and tadalafil on contraction, and relaxation of prostate strips were studied via organ bath.  Results:   PDE10A was detectable by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescence staining in prostate tissues. Colocalization with markers suggested expression of PDE10A in smooth muscle cells and catecholaminergic nerves. Norepinephrine, the α1 -adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, and endothelins 1-3 induced concentration-dependent contractions of prostate strips, while electric field stimulation (EFS) induced frequence-dependent contractions. Application of TC-E 5005 (500 nM) caused significant inhibition of norepinephrine-, phenylephrine-, and endothelin-3-induced contractions. Inhibition of EFS-induced contractions by TC-E 5005 ranged around 50%, resembling inhibition of EFS-induced contractions by tadalafil (10 μM). The prostacyclin analog treprostinil and the nitric oxide donor DEA NONOate induced relaxations of precontracted prostate strips, which were significantly amplified by TCE 5005.  Conclusions:   The PDE10-selective inhibitor TC-E 5005 inhibits adrenergic and neurogenic smooth muscle contractions in the human prostate. TC-E 5005 inhibits neurogenic contractions with similar efficacy than tadalafil, so that urodynamic effects in vivo appear possible.

Materials and methods:   Susceptibility map calculation was performed using 3D gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 26 patients measured at 3T who previously received a planning CT of the prostate. Phase images were unwrapped using Laplacian-based phase unwrapping, the background field was removed with the V-SHARP method, and susceptibility maps were calculated with the iLSQR method. Two blinded readers were asked to identify peri- and intraprostatic calcifications.  Results:   Average mean and minimum susceptibility values (referenced to iliopsoas muscle) of calcifications were -0.249 ± 0.179 ppm and -0.551 ± 0.323 ppm, and average mean and maximum intensities in CT images were 319 ± 164 HU and 679 ± 392 HU. Twenty-one and 17 out of 22 prostatic calcifications were identified using susceptibility maps and magnitude images, respectively, as well as more than half of periprostatic phleboliths depicted by CT. Calcifications in the prostate and its periphery were quantitatively differentiable from noncalcified prostate tissue in CT (mean values for calcifications / for noncalcified tissue: 71 to 649 / -1 to 83 HU) and in QSM (mean values for calcifications / for noncalcified tissue: -0.641 to 0.063 / -0.046 to 0.181 ppm). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between susceptibility values and CT image intensities for calcifications (P < 0.004).  Conclusion:   Prostatic calcifications could be well identified with QSM. Susceptibility maps can be easily obtained from clinical prostate MR protocols that include a 3D gradient echo sequence, rendering it a promising technique for detection and quantification of intraprostatic calcifications.

However filters have drawbacks that make the automation of microscopy challenging. We report the semi-automated microscopy method we developed to analyze filtration-enriched CTCs from NSCLC and mPCa patients.  Methods:   Spiked cell lines in normal blood and CTCs were enriched by ISET (isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells). Fluorescent staining was carried out using epithelial (pan-cytokeratins, EpCAM), mesenchymal (vimentin, N-cadherin), leukocyte (CD45) markers and DAPI. Cytomorphological staining was carried out with Mayer-Hemalun or Diff-Quik. ALK-, ROS1-, ERG-rearrangement were detected by filter-adapted-FISH (FA-FISH). Microscopy was carried out using an Ariol scanner.  Results:   Two combined assays were developed. The first assay sequentially combined four-color fluorescent staining, scanning, automated selection of CD45(-) cells, cytomorphological staining, then scanning and analysis of CD45(-) cell phenotypical and cytomorphological characteristics. CD45(-) cell selection was based on DAPI and CD45 intensity, and a nuclear area >55 μm(2). The second assay sequentially combined fluorescent staining, automated selection of CD45(-) cells, FISH scanning on CD45(-) cells, then analysis of CD45(-) cell FISH signals. Specific scanning parameters were developed to deal with the uneven surface of filters and CTC characteristics. Thirty z-stacks spaced 0.6 μm apart were defined as the optimal setting, scanning 82 %, 91 %, and 95 % of CTCs in ALK-, ROS1-, and ERG-rearranged patients respectively. A multi-exposure protocol consisting of three separate exposure times for green and red fluorochromes was optimized to analyze the intensity, size and thickness of FISH signals.

However, its radiochemical yield is low. We developed new PSMA probes using succinimidyl 4-18F-fluorobenzoate (18F-SFB), a rapid and effective 18F-labeling agent, taking advantage of the high radiochemical yield of this compound. We evaluated the probes as PET probes for PSMA imaging.  Methods:   Four 18F-labeled probes, 18F-8a, 18F-8b, 18F-10a, and 18F-10b, were synthesized using 18F-SFB, and their affinity for PSMA and partition coefficients (log D) were evaluated in vitro. Biodistribution studies were performed in human prostate cancer xenograft-bearing mice. PET images were obtained using 2 compounds, 18F-8a and 18F-10a, and a toxicologic study of 18F-10a was performed.  Results:   Four 18F-labeled asymmetric urea compounds, conjugated with 18F-SFB, were synthesized at a radiochemical yield of 30%-50% (decay-corrected), with a radiochemical purity greater than 95%. The radiochemical yield was 10-15 times higher than that of 18F-DCFPyL, the probe currently used in clinical studies. All 4 compounds showed high affinity for PSMA. 18F-8a and 18F-10a had a particularly high binding affinity (Ki values of 3.35 and 2.23 nM, respectively). In the biodistribution study, the accumulation of 18F-8a (13.3 ± 2.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) and 18F-10a (14.0 ± 3.1 %ID/g) in PSMA-positive human prostate (LNCaP) tumors was higher than that of the other 2 compounds and similar to that of 18F-DCFPyL (16.0 ± 2.9 %ID/g). 18F-10a showed the lowest hepatic and intestinal accumulation among the 4 compounds and slightly slower blood clearance than others. In the PET imaging studies, 18F-8a and 18F-10a were clearly visualized in LNCaP in xenograft-bearing mice. 18F-10a showed higher LNCaP-to-liver ratios than 18F-8a. We confirmed the safety profiles of 18F-10a; the no-observed-adverse-effects level was larger than 13.2 μg/kg.  Conclusion:   A novel 18F-labeled asymmetric urea compound, 18F-10a, had a high radiochemical yield, high binding affinity for PSMA, and pharmacokinetic profiles suitable for a PSMA imaging probe. We believe that 18F-10a can be effectively and safely used in this type of imaging.""","""['Naoya Harada', 'Hiroyuki Kimura', 'Satoru Onoe', 'Hiroyuki Watanabe', 'Daiko Matsuoka', 'Kenji Arimitsu', 'Masahiro Ono', 'Hideo Saji']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) with F-18-Labeled Compounds: the Influence of Prosthetic Groups on Tumor Uptake and Clearance Profile.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of a novel urea-based 68Ga-complex for imaging PSMA binding in tumor.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Synthesis, preclinical evaluation, and first-in-human study of Al18F-PSMA-Q for prostate cancer imaging.', 'PET Molecular Imaging: A Holistic Review of Current Practice and Emerging Perspectives for Diagnosis, Therapeutic Evaluation and Prognosis in Clinical Oncology.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Novel Imaging in Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'One-Step 18F-Labeling and Preclinical Evaluation of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Trifluoroborate Probes for Cancer Imaging.']"""

Methods:   This was a phase II 2-stage trial in 28 patients using two different treatment schedules (A: 20 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks intravenously and B: 8.4 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly) to determine the ORR of cabazitaxel with secondary end points including progression-free survival (PFS), safety, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   There was one objective response in schedule B. PFS and OS of schedule A was 3 and 6 months, respectively. PFS and OS of schedule B was 3 and 13 months, respectively.

There were two grade 5 toxicities from sepsis. Hematuria of any grade developed in greater percentage of patients (35%) as compared to previous cabazitaxel phase 3 trial and led to change in our protocol.

We compare rates of adherence to treatment guidelines for elderly patients across Texas and whether local specialist supply is an important determinant of treatment variation.  Methods:   Previous literature reviewed indicated 7 recommended courses of treatment for colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. We analyzed Texas Cancer Registry data linked with Medicare claims for the years 2004 to 2007 to study patients with these cancers. We tested for unadjusted and adjusted differences in treatment rates across 22 hospital referral regions (HRR). We tested whether variation in the local supply of specialists treating each cancer was an important determinant of treatment.  Results:   We found significant differences in adjusted treatment rates across regions. For removal and examination of 12+ lymph nodes with colon cancer resection, 13 of 22 HRRs had rates significantly different from the median region. For adjuvant chemotherapy for regional colon cancer, five HRRs significantly differed from the median. For prostate cancer treatment with a favorable diagnosis, nine HRRs differed from the median HRR.

Bile acids, as essential components of the microbiome, have gained sustained credibility as potential modulators of cancer progression in several disease models. At physiological concentrations, bile acids appear to influence cancer phenotypes, although conflicting data surrounds their precise physiological mechanism of action. Previously, we demonstrated bile acids destabilised the HIF-1α subunit of the Hypoxic-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor. HIF-1 overexpression is an early biomarker of tumour metastasis and is associated with tumour resistance to conventional therapies, and poor prognosis in a range of different cancers.  Methods:   Here we investigated the effects of bile acids on the cancer growth and migratory potential of cell lines where HIF-1α is known to be active under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1α status was investigated in A-549 lung, DU-145 prostate and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines exposed to bile acids (CDCA and DCA). Cell adhesion, invasion, migration was assessed in DU-145 cells while clonogenic growth was assessed in all cell lines.  Results:   Intracellular HIF-1α was destabilised in the presence of bile acids in all cell lines tested. Bile acids were not cytotoxic but exhibited greatly reduced clonogenic potential in two out of three cell lines. In the migratory prostate cancer cell line DU-145, bile acids impaired cell adhesion, migration and invasion. CDCA and DCA destabilised HIF-1α in all cells and significantly suppressed key cancer progression associated phenotypes; clonogenic growth, invasion and migration in DU-145 cells.

We identified 111 EB-associated and 86 BPA-associated genes, with 20 in common, that have significant differentially methylated regions. Pathway analysis revealed cancer as the top common disease pathway. Bisulfite sequencing validated the differential methylation patterns observed by array analysis in 15 identified candidate genes. The methylation status of 7 (Pitx3, Wnt10b, Paqr4, Sox2, Chst14, Tpd52, Creb3l4) of these 15 genes exhibited an inverse correlation with gene expression in tissue samples. Cell-based assays, using 5-aza-cytidine-treated normal (NbE-1) and cancerous (AIT) rat prostate cells, added evidence of DNA methylation-mediated gene expression of 6 genes (exception: Paqr4). Functional connectivity of these genes was linked to embryonic stem cell pluripotency. Furthermore, clustering analyses using the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that expression of this set of 7 genes was associated with recurrence-free survival of PCa patients.

Pre-clinical in vivo models are limited in their ability to define the temporal effects of therapies on simultaneous multicellular interactions in the cancer-bone microenvironment. Integrating biological and computational modeling approaches can overcome this limitation. Here, we generated a biologically driven discrete hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) model of bone metastatic prostate cancer to identify the optimal therapeutic window for putative targeted therapies. As proof of principle, we focused on TGFβ because of its known pleiotropic cellular effects. HCA simulations predict an optimal effect for TGFβ inhibition in a pre-metastatic setting with quantitative outputs indicating a significant impact on prostate cancer cell viability, osteoclast formation and osteoblast differentiation. In silico predictions were validated in vivo with models of bone metastatic prostate cancer (PAIII and C4-2B). Analysis of human bone metastatic prostate cancer specimens reveals heterogeneous cancer cell use of TGFβ. Patient specific information was seeded into the HCA model to predict the effect of TGFβ inhibitor treatment on disease evolution. Collectively, we demonstrate how an integrated computational/biological approach can rapidly optimize the efficacy of potential targeted therapies on bone metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Leah M Cook', 'Arturo Araujo', 'Julio M Pow-Sang', 'Mikalai M Budzevich', 'David Basanta', 'Conor C Lynch']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Transforming growth factor beta derived from bone matrix promotes cell proliferation of prostate cancer and osteoclast activation-associated osteolysis in the bone microenvironment.', 'An integrated computational model of the bone microenvironment in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Bone metastases in prostate cancer: a targeted approach.', 'Pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer bone metastases: targeting the lethal phenotype.', 'Data integration between clinical research and patient care: A framework for context-depending data sharing and in silico predictions.', 'γδ-Enriched CAR-T cell therapy for bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A combined experimental-computational approach uncovers a role for the Golgi matrix protein Giantin in breast cancer progression.', 'Emerging roles for myeloid immune cells in bone metastasis.', 'Fractionated follow-up chemotherapy delays the onset of resistance in bone metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

The avidity of the engineered T-cells is of crucial importance for therapy success. We have in the past cloned a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes an HLA-A2 (MHC class I)-restricted peptide from the prostate and breast cancer- associated antigen TARP. Herein we perform a side-by-side comparison of the TARP-specific TCR (TARP-TCR) with a newly cloned TCR specific for an HLA-A2-restricted peptide from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigen.  Results:   Both CD8(+) T-cells and CD4(+) T-cells transduced with the HLA-A2-restricted TARP-TCR could readily be detected by multimer analysis, indicating that the binding is rather strong, since binding occured also without the CD8 co-receptor of HLA-A2. Not surprisingly, the TARP-TCR, which is directed against a self-antigen, had weaker binding to the HLA-A2/peptide complex than the CMV pp65-specific TCR (pp65-TCR), which is directed against a viral epitope. Higher peptide concentrations were needed to achieve efficient cytokine release and killing of target cells when the TARP-TCR was used. We further introduce the LigandTracer technology to study cell-cell interactions in real time by evaluating the interaction between TCR-engineered T-cells and peptide-pulsed cancer cells. We were able to successfully detect TCR-engineered T-cell binding kinetics to the target cells. We also used the xCELLigence technology to analyzed cell growth of target cells to assess the killing potency of the TCR-engineered T-cells. T-cells transduced with the pp65 - TCR exhibited more pronounced cytotoxicity, being able to kill their targets at both lower effector to target ratios and lower peptide concentrations.  Conclusion:   The combination of binding assay with functional assays yields data suggesting that TARP-TCR-engineered T-cells bind to their target, but need more antigen stimulation compared to the pp65-TCR to achieve full effector response. Nonetheless, we believe that the TARP-TCR is an attractive candidate for immunotherapy development for prostate and/or breast cancer.""","""['Victoria Hillerdal', 'Vanessa F Boura', 'Hanna Björkelund', 'Karl Andersson', 'Magnus Essand']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Immunol""","""['T cells engineered with a T cell receptor against the prostate antigen TARP specifically kill HLA-A2+ prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Chronic TCR-MHC (self)-interactions limit the functional potential of TCR affinity-increased CD8 T lymphocytes.', 'Effective treatment of refractory CMV reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation with in vitro-generated CMV pp65-specific CD8+ T-cell lines.', 'TCR-engineered T cells to treat tumors: Seeing but not touching?', 'T Cell Receptors for Gene Transfer in Adoptive T Cell Therapy.', 'A Bright Horizon: Immunotherapy for Pediatric T-Cell Malignancies.', 'TARP as antigen in cancer immunotherapy.', 'SITC cancer immunotherapy resource document: a compass in the land of biomarker discovery.', 'Recent developments in immunotherapy of cancers caused by human papillomaviruses.', 'The Quest for the Best: How TCR Affinity, Avidity, and Functional Avidity Affect TCR-Engineered T-Cell Antitumor Responses.']"""

Data were obtained from clinical reports, condition was recorded based on self-report including demographics, weight, height, and WC (>90 cm=obese).

PSA parameters of density (PSAD), PSA serum level, and PSA increasing rate per year (PSAR) were calculated per BMI and age groups (30-40, 41-59, 60-85 years). Obesity indicators (BMI and WC) and PSA parameter relationships were modeled by age-stratified linear regression. Of 35,632 Chinese men surveyed, 13,084 were analyzed, including 13.44% obese, 57.44% overweight, and 29.12% normal weight, according to BMI; 25.84% were centrally (abdominally) obese according to WC. BMI and WC were negatively associated with all PSA parameters, except PSAD and PSAR [P<0.05, BMI: β=-0.081 (95%CI=-0.055 to -0.036), WC: β=-0.101 (-0.021 to -0.015)], and independent of FBG and PV (P<0.05) in an age-adjusted model.

Fourteen candidate genes implicated in either initiation or progression of prostate cancer were tagged using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from HapMap with a minor allele frequency of >5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as time from development of CRPC to death. Principal component analysis was used for gene levels tests of significance. For SNP-level results the per allele hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under the additive allele model were estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for age at CRPC and Gleason score (GS).  Results:   A total of 240 patients with CRPC were genotyped (14 genes; 84 SNPs). The median (range) age of the cohort was 69 (43-93) years. The GS distribution was 55% with GS ≥8, 32% with GS = 7 and 13% with GS <7 or unknown.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the increased risk of PCa. Because most of the susceptibility SNPs are located in noncoding regions, little is known about their functional mechanisms. We hypothesize that functional SNPs reside in cell type-specific regulatory elements that mediate the binding of critical transcription factors (TFs), which in turn result in changes in target gene expression. Using PCa-specific functional genomics data, here we identify 38 regulatory candidate SNPs and their target genes in PCa. Through risk analysis by incorporating gene expression and clinical data, we identify 6 target genes (ZG16B, ANKRD5, RERE, FAM96B, NAALADL2 and GTPBP10) as significant predictors of PCa biochemical recurrence. In addition, 5 SNPs (rs2659051, rs10936845, rs9925556, rs6057110 and rs2742624) are selected for experimental validation using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), dual-luciferase reporter assay in LNCaP cells, showing allele-specific enhancer activity.

Epithelial plasticity is known to be important for metastatic dissemination and therapeutic resistance. The goal of this study is to elucidate the functional consequence of induced epithelial plasticity on AR regulation during disease progression to identify factors important for treatment-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer. We pinpoint the epithelial plasticity transcription factor, Snail, at the nexus of enzalutamide resistance and prostate cancer metastasis both in preclinical models of prostate cancer and in patients. In patients, Snail expression is associated with Gleason 9-10 high-risk disease and is strongly overexpressed in metastases as compared to localized prostate cancer. Snail expression is also elevated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells compared to enzalutamide-sensitive cells, and downregulation of Snail re-sensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to enzalutamide. While activation of Snail increases migration and invasion, it is also capable of promoting enzalutamide resistance in enzalutamide-sensitive cells. This Snail-mediated enzalutamide resistance is a consequence of increased full-length AR and AR-V7 expression and nuclear localization. Downregulation of either full-length AR or AR-V7 re-sensitizes cells to enzalutamide in the presence of Snail, thus connecting Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance directly to AR biology. Finally, we demonstrate that Snail is capable of mediating-resistance through AR even in the absence of AR-V7. These findings imply that increased Snail expression during progression to metastatic disease may prime cells for resistance to AR-targeted therapies by promoting AR activity in prostate cancer.""","""['Kathryn E Ware', 'Jason A Somarelli', 'Daneen Schaeffer', 'Jing Li', 'Tian Zhang', 'Sally Park', 'Steven R Patierno', 'Jennifer Freedman', 'Wen-Chi Foo', 'Mariano A Garcia-Blanco', 'Andrew J Armstrong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Targeted suppression of AR-V7 using PIP5K1α inhibitor overcomes enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Niclosamide suppresses cell migration and invasion in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells via Stat3-AR axis inhibition.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A synthetic lethal screen for Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'ISL1 promotes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).']"""

Immunotherapy is a rapidly growing approach for treatment of cancer but has shown limited success to date in the treatment of mCRPC. We have developed a novel humanized bispecific antibody, MOR209/ES414, built on the ADAPTIR (modular protein technology) platform, to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity toward prostate cancer cells by specifically targeting T cells through CD3ε to prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen). In vitro cross-linking of T cells with PSMA-expressing tumor cells by MOR209/ES414 triggered potent target-dependent tumor lysis and induction of target-dependent T-cell activation and proliferation. This activity occurred at low picomolar concentrations of MOR209/ES414 and was effective at low T-effector to tumor target cell ratios. In addition, cytotoxic activity was equivalent over a wide range of PSMA expression on target cells, suggesting that as few as 3,700 PSMA receptors per cell are sufficient for tumor lysis. In addition to high sensitivity and in vitro activity, MOR209/ES414 induced limited production of cytokines compared with other bispecific antibody formats. Pharmacokinetic analysis of MOR209/ES414 demonstrated a serum elimination half-life in NOD/SCID γ (NSG) mice of 4 days. Administration of MOR209/ES414 in murine xenograft models of human prostate cancer significantly inhibited tumor growth, prolonged survival, and decreased serum prostate-specific antigen levels only in the presence of adoptively transferred human T cells. On the basis of these preclinical findings, MOR209/ES414 warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of CRPC.

We tested whether a lycopene-rich tomato intervention could reduce the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Prior to their curative treatment, 79 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a nutritional intervention with either 1) tomato products containing 30 mg lycopene per day; 2) tomato products plus selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, soy isoflavones, grape/pomegranate juice, and green/black tea (tomato-plus); or 3) control diet for 3 weeks.  Results:   The main analysis, which included patients in all risk categories, did not reveal differences in changes of PSA-values between the intervention and control groups. Post-hoc, exploratory analyses within intermediate risk (n = 41) patients based on tumor classification and Gleason score post-surgery, revealed that median PSA decreased significantly in the tomato group as compared to controls (-2.9% and +6.5% respectively, p = 0.016). In separate post-hoc analyses, we observed that median PSA-values decreased by 1% in patients with the highest increases in plasma lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid, compared to an 8.5% increase in the patients with the lowest increase in lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid (p = 0.003). Also, PSA decreased in patients with the highest increase in lycopene alone (p = 0.009).  Conclusions:   Three week nutritional interventions with tomato-products alone or in combination with selenium and n-3 fatty acids lower PSA in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer.

The enzyme β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2), which catalyzes asymmetric cleavage of several carotenoids, is the principal regulator of lycopene metabolism, but the range of BCO2 biological functions is incompletely understood. This study investigated expression and functional roles of BCO2 in human prostate cancer. Expression of the bco2 gene is dramatically decreased in prostate cancer tissue and in a range of prostate cancer cell lines as compared with nonneoplastic prostate tissue and normal prostatic epithelial cells, respectively. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity restored bco2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines tested. Treatment with lycopene or its metabolite, apo-10-lycopenal, also increased bco2 expression and reduced cell proliferation in androgen-sensitive cell lines, but lycopene neither altered bco2 expression nor cell growth in androgen-resistant cells. Notably, restoring bco2 expression in prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, irrespective of lycopene exposure. Exogenous expression of either wild-type BCO2 or a mutant (enzymatically inactive) BCO2 in prostate cancer cells reduced NF-κB activity and decreased NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Together, these results indicate epigenetic loss of BCO2 expression is associated with prostate cancer progression. Moreover, these findings describe previously unanticipated functions of BCO2 that are independent of its enzymatic role in lycopene metabolism.  Implications:   This study identifies BCO2 as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. BCO2-mediated inhibition of NF-κB signaling implies BCO2 status is important in prostate cancer progression.

A remaining challenge is the integration of fast, non-ionizing volumetric imaging. Recently, robotic ultrasound has been proposed as an intra-fraction image modality. We study the impact of integrating a light-weight robotic arm carrying an ultrasound probe with the CyberKnife system. Particularly, we analyze the effect of different robot poses on the plan quality.  Methods:   A method to detect the collision of beams with the robot or the transducer was developed and integrated into our treatment planning system. A safety margin accounts for beam motion and uncertainties. Using strict dose bounds and the objective to maximize target coverage, we generated a total of 7650 treatment plans for five different prostate cases. For each case, ten different poses of the ultrasound robot and transducer were considered. The effect of different sets of beam source positions and different motion margins ranging from 5 to 50 mm was analyzed.  Results:   Compared to reference plans without the ultrasound robot, the coverage typically drops for all poses. Depending on the patient, the robot pose, and the motion margin, the reduction in coverage may be up to 50 % points. However, for all patient cases, there exist poses for which the loss in coverage was below 1 % point for motion margins of up to 20 mm. In general, there is a positive correlation between the number of treatment beams and the coverage.  Conclusion:   While the blocking of beam directions has a negative effect on the plan quality, the results indicate that a careful choice of the ultrasound robot's pose and a large solid angle covered by beam starting positions can offset this effect. Identifying robot poses that yield acceptable plan quality and allow for intra-fraction ultrasound image guidance, therefore, appears feasible.""","""['Stefan Gerlach', 'Ivo Kuhlemann', 'Philipp Jauer', 'Ralf Bruder', 'Floris Ernst', 'Christoph Fürweger', 'Alexander Schlaefer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Impact of robotic ultrasound image guidance on plan quality in SBRT of the prostate.', 'Optimizing robot motion for robotic ultrasound-guided radiation therapy.', 'Telerobotic system concept for real-time soft-tissue imaging during radiotherapy beam delivery.', 'SBRT targets that move with respiration.', 'Review of ultrasound image guidance in external beam radiotherapy: I.

The corresponding health impacts have not been quantified. Nevertheless the public authority implemented an exposure reduction program in 2003. We develop methods for quantifying the health impacts of chlordecone and present the results in 2 articles: 1. hazard identification, exposure-response functions (ERF) and exposure in Guadeloupe, 2. Health impacts and benefits of exposure reduction. Here is the first article.  Methods:   Relevant data are extracted from publications searched in Medline and Toxline. Available knowledges on mode of action and key-event hazards of chlordecone are used to identify effects of chlordecone that could occur at low dose. Then a linear ERF is derived for each possible effect. From epidemiological data, ERF is the delta relative risk (RR-1) divided by the corresponding delta exposure. From animal studies, ERF is the benchmark response (10 %) divided by the best benchmark dose modeled with BMDS2.4.0. Our goal is to obtain central values for the ERF slopes, applicable to typical human populations, rather than lower or upper bounds in the most sensitive species or sex.  Results:   We derive ERFs for 3 possible effects at chronic low chlordecone dose: cancers, developmental impairment, and hepatotoxicity. Neurotoxicity in adults is also a possible effect at low dose but we lack quantitative data for the ERF derivation. A renal toxicity ERF is derived for comparison purpose. Two ERFs are based on epidemiological studies: prostate cancer in men aged >44y (0.0019 per μg/Lblood) and altered neurodevelopment in boys (-0.32 QIpoint per μg/Lcord-blood). Two are based on animal studies: liver cancer (2.69 per mg/kg/d), and renal dysfunction in women (0.0022 per mg/kg/d).  Conclusion:   The methodological framework developed here yields ERFs for central risk estimates for non-genotoxic effects of chemicals; it is robust with regard to models used. This framework can be used generally to derive ERFs suitable for risk assessment and for cost-benefit analysis of public health decisions.""","""['Vincent Nedellec', 'Ari Rabl', 'William Dab']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Environ Health""","""['Public health and chronic low chlordecone exposures in Guadeloupe; Part 2: Health impacts, and benefits of prevention.', 'Visuospatial processing and fine motor function among 7-years old Guadeloupe children pre- and postnatally exposed to the organochlorine pesticide chlordecone.', 'Chlordecone exposure and adverse effects in French West Indies populations.', 'Determination of a site-specific reference dose for methylmercury for fish-eating populations.', 'Chlordecone neurotoxicity: a brief overview.', 'Low Doses of PFOA Promote Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells Growth through Different Pathways.', 'A Review on Recent Sensing Methods for Determining Formaldehyde in Agri-Food Chain: A Comparison with the Conventional Analytical Approaches.', 'Critical Evaluation of Cross-Sectoral Collaborations to Inform the Implementation of the ""One Health"" Approach in Guadeloupe.', 'Brain Disorders and Chemical Pollutants: A Gap Junction Link?', 'Development of electrochemical biosensor based on CNT-Fe3O4 nanocomposite to determine formaldehyde adulteration in orange juice.']"""

Recently it was reported that silibinin inhibited tumor growth through activation of the apoptotic signaling pathway. Although various evidences showed multiple signaling pathways of silibinin in apoptosis, there were no reports to address the clear mechanism of ROS-mediated pathway in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Several studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in various signaling cascades, but the primary source of ROS was currently unclear.  Methods:   The effect of silibinin was investigated on cell growth of prostate cell lines by MTT assay. We examined whether silibinin induced apoptosis through production of ROS using flow cytometry. Expression of apoptosis-, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related protein and gene were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively.  Results:   Results showed that silibinin triggered mitochondrial ROS production through NOX4 expression and finally led to induce apoptosis. In addition, mitochondrial ROS caused ER stress through disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Co-treatment of ROS inhibitor reduced the silibinin-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of NOX4 expression, resulting in reduction of both Ca(2+) level and ER stress response.  Conclusions:   Taken together, silibinin induced mitochondrial ROS-dependent apoptosis through NOX4, which is associated with disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis and ER stress response. Therefore, the regulation of NOX4, mitochondrial ROS producer, could be a potential target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Sang-Hun Kim', 'Kwang-Youn Kim', 'Sun-Nyoung Yu', 'Young-Kyo Seo', 'Sung-Sik Chun', 'Hak-Sun Yu', 'Soon-Cheol Ahn']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Silibinin stimluates apoptosis by inducing generation of ROS and ER stress in human choriocarcinoma cells.', 'Autophagy inhibition enhances silibinin-induced apoptosis by regulating reactive oxygen species production in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway in quercetin-mediated cell death of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Nox NADPH oxidases and the endoplasmic reticulum.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress and Nox-mediated reactive oxygen species signaling in the peripheral vasculature: potential role in hypertension.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Silver nanoparticle-induced alteration of mitochondrial and ER homeostasis affects human breast cancer cell fate.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Silybin induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation via TRPV4 channels in mouse mesenteric arteries.', 'ROS and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pulmonary Disease.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men with elevated prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal exam underwent a 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with endorectal coil. ADC maps were calculated using b values of 0, 500, 1000, and 1500; additional images were obtained with b value of 2000. We prospectively enrolled 312 men with lesions suspicious for cancer (suspicion score 2-5) on mpMRI. MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsies were performed. Mean ADC of suspicious lesions were correlated against lesion volume, Gleason and D'Amico risk.  Results:   The cancer detection rate of fusion biopsy per lesion was 45.6% (206/452). Cancerous lesions were larger (median volume: 0.40 vs. 0.30 cm3 ; P = 0.016). The median ADC (×10-6 mm2 /sec) for lesions negative and positive for PCa were 984.5 and 666.5, respectively (P < 0.0001). The AUC of ADC in predicting PCa was 0.79. Larger lesions were associated with higher risk PCa (Gleason and D'Amico) and lower ADC (all P < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   The mean ADC of suspicious lesions on mpMRI was inversely correlated, while lesion volume had a direct correlation with PCa detection. Future follow-up studies are needed to assess longitudinal cancer risks of suspicious mpMRI lesions.  Level of evidence:   2 J. Magn. Reson.

Integrated delivery systems may have the greatest ability to deliver high quality, efficient care. We sought to understand the association between health care integration and quality of prostate cancer care.  Materials and methods:   We used SEER-Medicare data to perform a retrospective cohort study of men older than age 65 with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2007 and 2011. We defined integration within a health care market based on the number of discharges from a top 100 integrated delivery system, and compared rates of adherence to well accepted prostate cancer quality measures in markets with no integration vs full integration (greater than 90% of discharges from an integrated system).  Results:   The average man treated in a fully integrated market was more likely to receive pretreatment counseling by a urologist and radiation oncologist (62.6% vs 60.3%, p=0.03), avoid inappropriate imaging (72.2% avoided vs 60.6%, p <0.001), avoid treatment when life expectancy was less than 10 years (23.7% vs 17.3%, p <0.001) and avoid multiple hospitalizations in the last 30 days of life (50.2% vs 43.6%, p=0.001) than when treated in markets with no integration. Additionally, patients treated in fully integrated markets were more likely to have complete adherence to all eligible quality measures (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.27-1.50).  Conclusions:   Integrated systems are associated with improved adherence to several prostate cancer quality measures.

Tumors harboring genetic defects in homologous recombination (HR), a DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Early phase clinical trials with PARPi have been promising in patients with advanced BRCA1 or BRCA2-associated breast, ovary and prostate cancer and have led to limited approval for treatment of BRCA-deficient ovary cancer. Unlike HR-defective cells, HR-proficient cells manifest very low cytotoxicity when exposed to PARPi, although they mount a DNA damage response. However, the genotoxic effects on normal human cells when agents including PARPi disturb proficient cellular repair processes have not been substantially investigated. We quantified cytogenetic alterations of human cells, including primary lymphoid cells and non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, exposed to PARPi at clinically relevant doses by both sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assays and chromosome spreading. As expected, both olaparib and veliparib effectively inhibited poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR), and caused marked hypersensitivity in HR-deficient cells. Significant dose-dependent increases in SCEs were observed in normal and non-tumorigenic cells with minimal residual PAR activity. Clinically relevant doses of the FDA-approved olaparib led to a marked increase of SCEs (5-10-fold) and chromatid aberrations (2-6-fold). Furthermore, olaparib potentiated SCE induction by cisplatin in normal human cells. Our data have important implications for therapies with regard to sustained genotoxicity to normal cells. Genomic instability arising from PARPi warrants consideration, especially if these agents will be used in people with early stage cancers, in prevention strategies or for non-oncologic indications.""","""['Shuhei Ito', 'Conleth G Murphy', 'Ekaterina Doubrovina', 'Maria Jasin', 'Mary Ellen Moynahan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Use of poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors in cancer cells bearing DDR defects: the rationale for their inclusion in the clinic.', 'Synthetic lethality between BRCA1 deficiency and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition is modulated by processing of endogenous oxidative DNA damage.', 'New Targeted Agents in Gynecologic Cancers: Synthetic Lethality, Homologous Recombination Deficiency, and PARP Inhibitors.', 'Drug-Driven Synthetic Lethality: Bypassing Tumor Cell Genetics with a Combination of AsiDNA and PARP Inhibitors.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibition and anticancer activity of simmiparib, a new inhibitor undergoing clinical trials.', 'Inactive PARP1 causes embryonic lethality and genome instability in a dominant-negative manner.', 'Sister chromatid exchanges induced by perturbed replication can form independently of BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51.', 'The Influence of PARP, ATR, CHK1 Inhibitors on Premature Mitotic Entry and Genomic Instability in High-Grade Serous BRCAMUT and BRCAWT Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Cytocidal Antitumor Effects against Human Ovarian Cancer Cells Induced by B-Lactam Steroid Alkylators with Targeted Activity against Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Enzymes in a Cell-Free Assay.', 'Characterization of a RAD51C-silenced high-grade serous ovarian cancer model during development of PARP inhibitor resistance.']"""

Amongst 700 genes displaying reciprocal expression patterns we observed a significant enrichment in the cellular process glycosylation. Of 31 reciprocally-regulated glycosylation enzymes, a set of 8 (GALNT7, ST6GalNAc1, GCNT1, UAP1, PGM3, CSGALNACT1, ST6GAL1 and EDEM3) were significantly up-regulated in clinical prostate carcinoma. Androgen exposure stimulated synthesis of glycan structures downstream of this core set of regulated enzymes including sialyl-Tn (sTn), sialyl Lewis(X) (SLe(X)), O-GlcNAc and chondroitin sulphate, suggesting androgen regulation of the core set of enzymes controls key steps in glycan synthesis.

PDCA is rarely detected at an early stage but is characterized by rapid progression and invasiveness. We now report the significance of the subcellular localization of Kaiso in PDCAs from African Americans. Kaiso expression is higher in the cytoplasm of invasive and metastatic pancreatic cancers. In males, cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso correlates with cancer grade and lymph node positivity. In male and female patients, cytoplasmic Kaiso expression correlates with invasiveness. Also, nuclear expression of Kaiso increases with increased invasiveness and lymph node positivity. Further, analysis of the largest PDCA dataset available on ONCOMINE shows that as Kaiso increases, there is an overall increase in Zeb1, which is the inverse for E-cadherin.

Degarelix is a novel gonadotrophin-releasing hormone blocker, used to decrease serum androgen levels in order to treat advanced human prostate cancer. Little is known of the rapid metabolic response of the human prostate cancer tissue samples to the decreased androgen levels.  Objectives:   To investigate the metabolic responses in benign and cancerous tissue samples from patients after treatment with Degarelix by using HRMAS 1H NMR spectroscopy.  Methods:   Using non-destructive HR-MAS 1H NMR spectroscopy we analysed the metabolic changes induced by decreased AR signalling in human prostate cancer tissue samples. Absolute concentrations of the metabolites alanine, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, citrate, choline compounds [t-choline = choline + phosphocholine (PC) + glycerophosphocholine (GPC)], creatine compounds [t-creatine = creatine (Cr) + phosphocreatine (PCr)], taurine, myo-inositol and polyamines were measured in benign prostate tissue samples (n = 10), in prostate cancer specimens from untreated patients (n = 7) and prostate cancer specimens from patients treated with Degarelix (n = 6).  Results:   Lactate, alanine and t-choline concentrations were significantly elevated in high-grade prostate cancer samples when compared to benign samples in untreated patients. Decreased androgen levels resulted in significant decreases of lactate and t-choline concentrations in human prostate cancer biopsies.

Objective:   To characterize the clinical and biological presentations of patients with anti-CASPR2 antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 18 patients who had anti-CASPR2 antibodies in their CSF between March 2009 and November 2015 at the Centre National de Référence pour les Syndromes Neurologiques Paranéoplasiques in Lyon, France. Additionally, we analyzed 15 patients who were diagnosed as having NMT or MoS as a comparative group.  Main outcomes and measures:   Clinical presentations, anti-CASPR2 antibodies specificities, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and CSF analyses, cancer prevalence, and evolution.  Results:   In this cohort of 18 patients with anti-CASPR2 antibodies in their CSF, 17 (94.4%) were male and had a median (range) age of 64.5 (53-75) years; in the second group, 9 of 15 patients (60.0%) with NMT or MoS were male and had a median (range) age of 51 years (1 month to 75 years). Only 3 patients (16.7%) in this cohort had a previous or concomitant history of cancer (prostate, hematological, or thyroid), whereas 9 patients (60.0%) in the second group had a malignant thymoma. Symptoms of limbic encephalitis were observed in all patients, including temporal lobe seizures in 16 patients (88.9%) and memory disorders in 17 patients (94.4%) from the cohort. Extralimbic signs were also evident in 12 of 18 patients (66.7%), including cerebellar ataxia in 6 patients (33.3%). Only 2 patients (11.1%) from the cohort were diagnosed as having NMT. Brain magnetic resonance imaging displayed T2-weighted temporolimbic abnormalities in 14 of 15 patients (93.3%) in the second group. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was abnormal in 9 of 12 patients (75.0%). For 16 of 18 patients (88.9%), follow-up was performed for at least a 6-month period (median [range], 34 [11-114] months).

In previous in vitro and in vivo studies we have shown that ovarian cancer cells with amplified/overexpressed Pak1 were significantly more sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of Pak1 compared to cells without 11q13 amplification. In the present study we examined if additional signaling pathways might be targeted in tandem with the Group I Pak inhibitor Frax-1036 in ovarian cancer cells. Using the ICCB Known Bioactives Library, we found that the cytotoxic effect of Frax-1036 was significantly higher in combination with the PKCδ inhibitor, Rottlerin, suggesting that Pak inhibitors might be combined with other agents to treat 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer.""","""['Tatiana Y Prudnikova', 'Jonathan Chernoff']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Small GTPases""","""['Effects of p21-activated kinase 1 inhibition on 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer cells.', 'Small molecule inhibition of group I p21-activated kinases in breast cancer induces apoptosis and potentiates the activity of microtubule stabilizing agents.', 'Combined array comparative genomic hybridization and tissue microarray analysis suggest PAK1 at 11q13.5-q14 as a critical oncogene target in ovarian carcinoma.', 'P21 activated kinase signaling in cancer.', 'p21-activated kinase inhibitors.', 'Recent advances on development of p21-activated kinase 4 inhibitors as anti-tumor agents.', 'Exploring cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer through integrated bioinformatics approach and overcoming chemoresistance with sanguinarine.', 'Combined inhibition of Aurora A and p21-activated kinase 1 as a new treatment strategy in breast cancer.', 'Tumor suppressive role of rottlerin in cancer therapy.', 'Group I Paks are essential for epithelial- mesenchymal transition in an Apc-driven model of colorectal cancer.']"""

Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic predictors of risk factors as instrumental variables to eliminate reverse causation and reduce confounding bias. We performed MR analyses to assess the possible causal relationship of birthweight, childhood and adult body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on the risks of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers.  Methods:   We tested the association between genetic risk scores and each trait using summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and from 51 537 cancer cases and 61 600 controls in the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Consortium.  Results:   We found an inverse association between the genetic score for childhood BMI and risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71 per standard deviation (s.d.) increase in childhood BMI; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.80; P = 6.5 × 10(-5)). We also found the genetic score for adult BMI to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 0.66 per s.d. increase in BMI; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.77; P = 2.5 × 10(-7)), and positively associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.72; P = 0.017), lung cancer (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.49; P = 2.9 × 10(-3)) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.82, P = 0.016). The inverse association between genetically predicted adult BMI and breast cancer risk remained even after adjusting for directional pleiotropy via MR-Egger regression.

Methods:   Initial benchmarking of KBP was performed using prostate cancer cases. Structures and dose distributions from 40 patients previously treated using a 5-field IMRT technique were used for model training. Two types of model were created: one excluded statistical outliers (as identified by RapidPlan guidelines) and the other had no exclusions. A separate model for cervix uteri cancer cases was subsequently developed using 37 clinical patients treated for cervical cancer using RapidArc™ VMAT, with no exclusions. The resulting models were then used to generate plans for ten patients from each patient group who had not been included in the modelling process. Comparisons of generated RapidPlans with the corresponding clinical plans were carried out to indicate the required modifications to the models. Model parameters were then iteratively adjusted until plan quality converged with that obtained by experienced planners without KBP.  Results:   Initial automated model generation settings led to poor conformity, coverage and efficiency compared to clinical plans. Therefore a number of changes to the initial KBP models were required. Before model optimisation, it was found that the PTV coverage was slightly reduced in the superior and inferior directions for RapidPlan compared with clinical plans and therefore PTV parameters were adjusted to improve coverage. OAR doses were similar for both RapidPlan and clinical plans (p>0.05). Excluding outliers had little effect on plan quality (p≫0.05). Manually fixing key optimisation objectives enabled production of clinically acceptable treatment plans without further planner intervention for 9 of 10 prostate test patients and all 10 cervix test patients.  Conclusions:   The Varian RapidPlan™ system was able to produce IMRT & VMAT treatment plans in the pelvis, in a single optimisation, that had comparable sparing and comparable or better conformity than the original clinically acceptable plans. The system allows for better consistency and efficiency in the treatment planning process and has therefore been adopted clinically within our institute with over 100 patients treated.""","""['Mohammad Hussein', 'Christopher P South', 'Miriam A Barry', 'Elizabeth J Adams', 'Tom J Jordan', 'Alexandra J Stewart', 'Andrew Nisbet']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Is it possible for knowledge-based planning to improve intensity modulated radiation therapy plan quality for planners with different planning experiences in left-sided breast cancer patients?', 'Effectiveness of Multi-Criteria Optimization-based Trade-Off exploration in combination with RapidPlan for head & neck radiotherapy planning.', 'Clinical implementation of a knowledge based planning tool for prostate VMAT.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Can knowledge based treatment planning of VMAT for post-mastectomy locoregional radiotherapy involving internal mammary chain and supraclavicular fossa improve performance efficiency?', 'Implementation, Dosimetric Assessment, and Treatment Validation of Knowledge-Based Planning (KBP) Models in VMAT Head and Neck Radiation Oncology.', 'Prediction of dose deposition matrix using voxel features driven machine learning approach.', 'The effect of integrating knowledge-based planning with multicriteria optimization in treatment planning for prostate SBRT.', 'Validation of RapidPlan Knowledge-Based Model for Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy in Prostate Cancer.']"""

P450 17A1 catalyzes both 17-hydroxylation and subsequent 17,20-lyase reactions with pregnenolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone. The presence of cytochrome b5 (b5) markedly stimulates the 17,20-lyase reaction, with little effect on 17-hydroxylation; however, the mechanism of this b5 effect is not known. We determined the influence of b5 on coupling efficiency-defined as the ratio of product formation to NADPH consumption-in a reconstituted system using these 3 pairs of substrates for the 2 reactions. Rates of NADPH consumption ranged from 4 to 13 nmol/min/nmol P450 with wild-type P450 17A1. For the 17-hydroxylase reaction, progesterone oxidation was the most tightly coupled (∼50%) and negligibly changed upon addition of b5. Rates of NADPH consumption were similar for the 17-hydroxylase and corresponding 17,20-lyase reactions for each steroid series, and b5 only slightly increased NADPH consumption. For the 17,20-lyase reactions, b5 markedly increased product formation and coupling in parallel with all substrates, from 6% to 44% with the major substrate 17-hydroxypregnenolone. For the naturally occurring P450 17A1 mutations E305G and R347H, which impair 17,20-lyase activity, b5 failed to rescue the poor coupling with 17-hydroxypregnenolone (2-4%). When the conserved active-site threonine was mutated to alanine (T306A), both the activity and coupling were markedly decreased with all substrates. We conclude that b5 stimulation of the 17,20-lyase reaction primarily derives from more efficient use of NADPH for product formation rather than side products.""","""['Hwei-Ming Peng', 'Sang-Choul Im', 'Naw May Pearl', 'Adina F Turcu', 'Juilee Rege', 'Lucy Waskell', 'Richard J Auchus']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Kinetic processivity of the two-step oxidations of progesterone and pregnenolone to androgens by human cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Substrate-modulated cytochrome P450 17A1 and cytochrome b5 interactions revealed by NMR.', 'Tight binding of cytochrome b5 to cytochrome P450 17A1 is a critical feature of stimulation of C21 steroid lyase activity and androgen synthesis.', 'Role of cytochrome b5 in the modulation of the enzymatic activities of cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450 17A1).', 'A Homodimer Model Can Resolve the Conundrum as to How Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase and Cytochrome b5 Compete for the Same Binding Site on Cytochrome P450c17.', 'Solvent isotope effects in the catalytic cycle of P450 CYP17A1: Computational modeling of the hydroxylation and lyase reactions.', 'Human cytochrome P450 17A1 structures with metabolites of prostate cancer drug abiraterone reveal substrate-binding plasticity and a second binding site.', 'Three pairs of surrogate redox partners comparison for Class I cytochrome P450 enzyme activity reconstitution.', 'Association of Insulin Resistance and Elevated Androgen Levels with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS): A Review of Literature.', ""On 'Evidence for the participation of cytochrome b5 in hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidation reactions' by Alfred Hildebrandt and Ronald W.

However, the knowledge about this combination treatment in ovarian cancer is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and PARP inhibitor Olaparib on ovarian cancer cell lines bearing wild-type PIK3CA genes.  Methods:   We exposed three wild-type PIK3CA ovarian cancer cell lines to a PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and/or a PARP inhibitor Olaparib. The effect of BKM120 as a single-agent or in combination with Olaparib was evaluated by Cell Count Kit (CCK8) assay, immunoblotting, comet assay, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining assay. The combination indexes for synergistic effect on cell viability were calculated with the Chou-Talalay method. Ex vivo cultured ovarian cancer tissues from patients were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical analyses.  Results:   Combined inhibition of PI3K and PARP effectively synergized to block the growth of three wild-type PIK3CA ovarian cancer cell lines and explants of a primary ovarian tumor specimen. Mechanistically, dual blockade of PI3K and PARP in these ovarian cancer cell lines resulted in substantially attenuated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, impaired DNA damage response and deficient homologous recombination repair, with remarkable BRCA downregulation.  Conclusions:   The combined use of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and PARP inhibitor Olaparib may be effective in ovarian cancers with a broader spectrum of cancer-associated genetic alterations but not limited to those with mutant PIK3CA or BRCA genes.

Although Her-2, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) are the major diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets to breast cancer, searching for additional molecular targets remains an important issue and one of the candidates is androgen receptor (AR). AR has been shown expressed in 70% breast cancer patients and connects to low recurrence and high survival rate. Our previous study demonstrates that Ser81 phosphorylation of AR in prostate cancer cells is critical for its protein stability modulated by human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2). The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Her2 and AR in proliferation of breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. The data show that AR which was activated by synthetic androgen R1881 suppressed the proliferation of MDA-MB-453 cells. Notably, AR activation decreased the protein levels of cell growth-related proteins, including cyclin A, cyclin B, and early growth response protein 1 (Egr1), while cell-cycle inhibitor protein p27 was increased. Besides, Heregulin (HRG)-induced Her2 activation decreased the AR protein levels and its Ser81 phosphorylation. Her2 small molecular inhibitor, Lapatinib, dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation while the levels of phospho-Ser81 AR and p27 protein were increased. Phospho-Ser81 AR was also increased after Her2 knockdown. Specifically, the influence of phospho-Ser81 AR by Lapatinib was primarily found in the nucleus of MDA-MD-453 cells, where the cell proliferation might directly be interfered. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Her2 might negatively regulate AR phosphorylation/activation and contribute to regulate the proliferation of MDA-MB 453 cells.""","""['Pao-Hsuan Huang', 'Hsin-Yi Wang', 'Chen-Chuan Huang', 'Yueh-Tsung Lee', 'Chia-Herng Yue', 'Mei-Chih Chen', 'Ho Lin']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['The significance of Her2 on androgen receptor protein stability in the transition of androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mislocalization of p27 to the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells confers resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapy.', 'Lapatinib inhibits the activation of NF-κB through reducing phosphorylation of IκB-α in breast cancer cells.', 'A systematic review of dual targeting in HER2-positive breast cancer.', 'Does lapatinib work against HER2-negative breast cancers?', 'Testis-Specific SEPT12 Expression Affects SUN Protein Localization and is Involved in Mammalian Spermiogenesis.']"""

Although HOXB13 also plays a role in breast tumor progression, the association of HOXB13 p.G84E with breast cancer risk is less evident. Therefore, we comprehensively interrogated the entire HOXB13 coding sequence for mutations in 1,250 non-BRCA1/2 familial breast cancer cases and 800 controls. We identified two predicted deleterious missense mutations, p.G84E and p.R217C, that were recurrent among breast cancer cases and further evaluated their association with breast cancer risk in a larger study. Taken together, 4,520 familial non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer cases and 3,127 controls were genotyped including the cases and controls of the whole gene screen. The concordance rate for the genotyping assays compared with Sanger sequencing was 100%. The prostate cancer risk allele p.G84E was identified in 18 (0.56%) of 3,187 cases and 16 (0.70%) of 2,300 controls (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.41-1.59, P = 0.54).

A considerable uncertainty is associated with carcinogenesis from photon-based treatment, and even less established when including relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for particle therapy. The aim of this work was therefore to estimate and in particular explore relative risks (RR) of secondary cancer (SC) following particle therapy as applied in treatment of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   RRs of radiation-induced SC in the bladder and rectum were estimated using a bell-shaped dose-response model incorporating RBE and fractionation effects. The risks from volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were compared to intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and scanning carbon ions for ten patients.  Results:   The mean estimated RR (95% CI) of SC for VMAT/C-ion was 1.31 (0.65-2.18) for the bladder and 0.58 (0.41-0.80) for the rectum. Corresponding values for VMAT/IMPT were 1.72 (1.06-2.37) and 1.10 (0.78-1.43). The radio-sensitivity parameter α had the strongest influence on the results with decreasing RR for increasing values of α.

Patients and methods:   The present study retrospectively included 280 consecutive mCRPC patients, consisting of 113 and 167 who had received AA and Enz, respectively, without previous treatment with docetaxel.  Results:   Of the several baseline characteristics examined, some parameters, including performance status (PS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, and incidence of lymph node metastasis, significantly favored the Enz over the AA group. The PSA response rate in the Enz group was significantly greater than that in the AA group, and the PSA progression-free survival in the Enz group was significantly superior to that in the AA group. Multivariate analyses of several parameters identified the following independent predictors of PSA progression-free survival: duration of androgen deprivation therapy and PS for the AA group, age and PS for the Enz group, and PS but not the introduced agent (ie, AA vs. Enz) for the overall patients. The common adverse events observed in the present series were fatigue (19.4%) and liver toxicity (11.5%) in the AA group and fatigue (32.3%) and appetite loss (19.2%) in the Enz group. In addition, the proportion of patients with adverse events grade ≥ 3 in the Enz group (11.4%) was significantly greater than that in the AA group (4.4%).

We have isolated two syngeneic cell lines (indolent and aggressive) through in vivo selection by implanting PC3mm stem-like cells into tibial bones. We found that indolent cells retained the dormant phenotype, whereas aggressive cells grew rapidly in bone in vivo, and the growth rates of both cells in culture were similar, suggesting a role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of dormancy and recurrence. Indolent cells were found to secrete a high level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which significantly stimulated the expression of BMP7 in bone marrow stromal cells. The secreted BMP7 then kept cancer cells in a dormant state by inducing senescence, reducing ""stemness,"" and activating dormancy-associated p38 MAPK signaling and p21 expression in cancer cells. Importantly, we found that SPARC was epigenetically silenced in aggressive cells by promoter methylation, but 5-azacytidine treatment reactivated the expression. Furthermore, high SPARC promoter methylation negatively correlated with disease-free survival of prostate cancer patients. We also found that the COX2 inhibitor NS398 down-regulated DNMTs and increased expression of SPARC, which led to tumor growth suppression in bone in vivo These findings suggest that SPARC plays a key role in maintaining the dormancy of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.""","""['Sambad Sharma', 'Fei Xing', 'Yin Liu', 'Kerui Wu', 'Neveen Said', 'Radhika Pochampally', 'Yusuke Shiozawa', 'Hui-Kuan Lin', 'K C Balaji', 'Kounosuke Watabe']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Bone morphogenetic protein 7 in dormancy and metastasis of prostate cancer stem-like cells in bone.', 'Coordinate regulation of microenvironmental stimuli and role of methylation in bone metastasis from breast carcinoma.', 'Osteoblast-Secreted Factors Mediate Dormancy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone via Activation of the TGFβRIII-p38MAPK-pS249/T252RB Pathway.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'Bone Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in Tumour Cell Dormancy in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Dormancy, stemness, and therapy resistance: interconnected players in cancer evolution.', 'The genomic regulation of metastatic dormancy.', 'SFRP2 Overexpression Induces an Osteoblast-like Phenotype in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Autophagy and Hepatic Tumor Microenvironment Associated Dormancy.']"""

To address this need we used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to develop appropriateness criteria and counseling statements for active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   Panelists were recruited from MUSIC urology practices. Combinations of parameters thought to influence decision making were used to create and score 160 theoretical clinical scenarios for appropriateness of active surveillance. Recent rates of active surveillance among real patients across the state were assessed using the MUSIC registry.  Results:   Low volume Gleason 6 was deemed highly appropriate for active surveillance whereas high volume Gleason 6 and low volume Gleason 3+4 were deemed appropriate to uncertain. No scenario was deemed inappropriate or highly inappropriate. Prostate specific antigen density, race and life expectancy impacted scores for intermediate and high volume Gleason 6 and low volume Gleason 3+4. The greatest degree of score dispersion (disagreement) occurred in scenarios with long life expectancy, high volume Gleason 6 and low volume Gleason 3+4. Recent rates of active surveillance use among real patients ranged from 0% to 100% at the provider level for low or intermediate biopsy volume Gleason 6, demonstrating a clear opportunity for quality improvement.

Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy was performed at 6 months. The primary end point was absence or histological persistence of disease at 6-month biopsy. Secondary end points included quality of life, biochemical recurrence-free survival, overall survival, cancer specific survival and progression to androgen deprivation therapy. Survival analysis was performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test.  Results:   Mean ± SD prostate specific antigen before high intensity focused ultrasound was 4.06 ± 2.88 ng/ml. At 6 months 63 men underwent biopsy, of whom 22 (35%) had residual disease. At a mean followup of 53.5 ± 31.6 months median biochemical recurrence-free survival was 63 months. The 5-year overall and cancer specific survival rates were 88% and 94.4%, respectively.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether intrafractional motion of the prostate is of clinical consequence, using a novel 4D autoscan ultrasound probe.  Methods:   Ten prostate patients were ultrasound (US) scanned at the time of CT imaging and once a week during their course of radiotherapy treatment in an ethics-approved study, using the transperineal Clarity autoscan system (Clarity®, Elekta Inc., Stockholm, Sweden). At each US scanning session (fraction) the prostate was monitored for 2 to 2.5 min, a typical beam-on time to deliver a RapidArc® radiotherapy fraction. The patients were instructed to remain motionless in supine position throughout the US scans. They were also requested to comply with a bladder-filling protocol. In total, 51 monitoring curves were acquired. Data of the prostate motion in three orthogonal directions were analyzed. Finally, the BMI value was calculated to investigate correlation between BMI and the extent of prostate displacement.  Results:   The patients were cooperative, despite extra time for applying the TPUS scan. The mean (±1SD) of the maximal intrafractional displacements were [mm]; I(+)/S: (0.2 ± 0.9); L(+)/R: (-0.2 ± 0.8); and A(+)/P: (-0.2 ± 1.1), respectively. The largest displacement was 2.8 mm in the posterior direction. The percentage of fractions with displacements larger than 2.0 mm was 4 %, 2 %, and 10 % in the IS, LR, and AP directions, respectively. The mean of the maximal intrafractional Euclidean distance (3D vector) was 0.9 ± 0.6 mm. For 12 % of the fractions the maximal 3D vector displacements were larger than 2.0 mm. At only two fractions (4 %) displacements larger than 3.0 mm were observed. There was no correlation between BMI and the extent of the prostate displacement.  Conclusions:   The prostate intrafractional displacement is of no clinically consequence for treatment times in the order of 2 - 2.5 min, which is typical for a RapidArc radiotherapy fraction.

Methods:   Individual patient data were collected from six studies (32,057 participants); including one population-based cohort and five randomized controlled trials. Participants were grouped into one of five CKD categories (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR ≥60 to <75 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR ≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2); eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2); on dialysis). Stratified Cox regression was used to assess the impact of CKD category on cancer incidence and cancer death.  Results:   Over a follow-up period of 170,000 person-years (mean follow-up among survivors 5.6 years), 2626 participants developed cancer and 1095 participants died from cancer. Overall, there was no significant association between CKD category and cancer incidence or death. As compared with the reference group with eGFR ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m(2), adjusted hazard ratio (HR) estimates for each category of renal function, in descending order, were: 0.98 (95 % CI 0.87-1.10), 0.99 (0.88-1.13), 1.01 (0.84-1.22) and 1.24 (0.97-1.58) for cancer incidence, and 1.03 (95 % CI 0.86-1.24), 0.95 (0.78-1.16), 1.00 (0.76-1.33), and 1.58 (1.09-2.30) for cancer mortality.

Recently, F7 gene has been identified as a direct target of the androgen receptor in breast cancer. In this study, we examined the mRNA expression of F7 and AR in clinical sample series of prostate cancer and BPH.  Material and methods:   All the prostate cancer patients were new cases with no medical history of surgery or chemotherapy. The tissue samples were assigned as either prostate cancer tumor (n= 45) harboring at least 80% tumor cell content, or BPH (n= 36). Relative AR and F7 mRNA expression in each tissue sample was normalized to the mean of the Ct values determined for GAPDH and PSA genes.  Results:   Mean plasma level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 17.82 ± 3.71 ng/ml and 7.71 ± 1.28 ng/ml (Mean ± SEM) in PCa and BPH group, respectively.

ANOVA analysis of the gene expression results showed significant correlation between F7 and AR mRNA expression in tumor samples (p< 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our study findings suggest a link between FVII and AR in prostate cancer pathogenesis.

None of the patients were receiving hormonal therapy. All 3 cases showed benign glands with ciliated cuboidal to columnar cells and rare secretory cells, morphologically comparable with endosalpingiosis in women. These glands were diffusely positive for PAX-8, WT-1, estrogen receptor, and progesteron receptor consistent with müllerian origin. Our study is the first to confirm müllerian origin of these glands by PAX-8 and WT-1 positivity. This finding of müllerian glands in men identical to endosalpingiosis in women supports the theory that this entity can result from müllerian metaplasia of the peritoneal mesothelium rather than displacement of tubal-type epithelium.

The objective of this study was to determine whether academic centers have less sociodemographic treatment disparities than community centers using high-risk prostate cancer as a test case.  Methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify 138,019 patients who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic, high-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2012. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify independent determinants of definitive therapy. The Gray test and multivariable Cox regression were used to analyze the timing of therapy. All analyses were stratified by academic versus community cancer center.  Results:   Compared with white or privately insured patients, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients with prostate cancer were less likely to receive definitive therapy at both community centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.64], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.78], and 0.25 [95% CI, 0.22-0.30], respectively) and academic cancer centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46-0.54], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.64], and 0.31 [95% CI, 0.28-0.36], respectively). Among patients who received definitive therapy, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients were more likely to experience treatment delays at both community centers (≥15, ≥ 10, and ≥19 days, respectively; all Gray P < .001) and academic centers (≥19, ≥ 11, and ≥18 days, respectively); treatment delays were observed among the aforementioned groups even after multivariable Cox regression analysis (P < .001 for all adjusted hazard ratios).  Conclusions:   Nationally, academic cancer centers demonstrate similarly high rates of sociodemographic disparities in cancer treatment patterns as community cancer centers.

The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the prevalence of 7 modifiable factors related to prostate cancer: smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, weight, colorectal cancer screening, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcal vaccination.  Methods:   We used data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to calculate the racial/ethnic prevalence of sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, health behaviors, and preventive health care among prostate cancer survivors. Adjusted prevalence estimates were calculated by using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   We identified 8,016 men with a history of prostate cancer. Multivariable analyses indicated that more black men reported being obese (29.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.5%-35.9%) than white men (22.8%; 95% CI, 21.1%-24.6%). More white men (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.9%-4.5%) reported consuming more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day than black men (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.4%-2.0%). More white men aged 65 or older reported receiving pneumococcal vaccine (74.2%; 95% CI, 72.2%-76.1%) than black men of the same age (63.2%; 95% CI, 54.8%-70.8%).We did not observe any differences in the prevalence of health behaviors and preventive health care between white men and men in Hispanic or other race categories.  Conclusion:   Differences in alcohol consumption, obesity, and receipt of pneumococcal vaccination existed only between black and white prostate cancer survivors.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that Talin-1 expression (AUC = 0.766) had a better accuracy to predict PCa lymph node metastasis than Gleason score (AUC = 0.697), whereas their combination could further enhance the prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.803). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that increased Talin-1 expression was associated with shortened biochemical-free survival of PCa patients after radical prostatectomy (P <0.001).These findings suggested that Talin-1 protein was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues compared with that of BPH tissue and Talin-1 expression was an independent predictor for lymph node metastasis and biochemical recurrence of PCa.

Under castrate conditions, DHT is produced from the metabolism of the adrenal androgen precursors, DHEA and androstenedione. Recent studies have shown that the adrenal steroid 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA4) serves as the precursor to the androgens 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (11KDHT). In this study we comprehensively assess the androgenic activity of 11KT and 11KDHT. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that 11KT and 11KDHT, like T and DHT, are potent and efficacious agonists of the human androgen receptor (AR) and induced both the expression of representative AR-regulated genes as well as cellular proliferation in the androgen dependent prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP. Proteomic analysis revealed that 11KDHT regulated the expression of more AR-regulated proteins than DHT in VCaP cells, while in vitro conversion assays showed that 11KT and 11KDHT are metabolized at a significantly lower rate in both LNCaP and VCaP cells when compared to T and DHT, respectively. Our findings show that 11KT and 11KDHT are bona fide androgens capable of inducing androgen-dependant gene expression and cell growth, and that these steroids have the potential to remain active longer than T and DHT due to the decreased rate at which they are metabolised. Collectively, our data demonstrates that 11KT and 11KDHT likely play a vital, but overlooked, role in the development and progression of CRPC.""","""['Elzette Pretorius', 'Donita J Africander', 'Maré Vlok', 'Meghan S Perkins', 'Jonathan Quanson', 'Karl-Heinz Storbeck']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', '11β-Hydroxydihydrotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone, novel C19 steroids with androgenic activity: a putative role in castration resistant prostate cancer?', 'Profiles of 5α-Reduced Androgens in Humans and Eels: 5α-Dihydrotestosterone and 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone Are Active Androgens Produced in Eel Gonads.', 'A new dawn for androgens: Novel lessons from 11-oxygenated C19 steroids.', 'The role of adrenal derived androgens in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Circulating adrenal 11-oxygenated androgens are associated with clinical outcome in endometrial cancer.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The Roles of Androgens in Humans: Biology, Metabolic Regulation and Health.', ""11-Oxygenated C19 steroids are the predominant androgens responsible for hyperandrogenemia in Cushing's disease.""]"""

Objective:   The aim of this study is to explore the relationships among demographic and disease characteristics, resourcefulness, depressive symptoms, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).  Methods:   A descriptive, correlational design was used. A total of 200 individuals with prostate cancer were recruited. The participants completed a self-report regarding their depressive symptoms and HRQOL. Using a structural equation modeling approach, all relationships among the factors, mediators, depressive symptoms, and HRQOL were analyzed.  Results:   The more resourcefulness that participants perceived, the more likely they were to report better HRQOL. The best-fitted structural equation model included individual demographics and disease characteristics and resourcefulness as significant predictors of HRQOL. Moreover, this structural model explained 72%, 76%, and 57% of the variance in physical quality of life, mental quality of life, and depressive symptoms, respectively. In addition, resourcefulness had a positive mediating effect on increasing the physical and mental quality of life and decreasing the depressive symptoms for patients with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Resourcefulness helps patients with prostate cancer build a positive attitude and that it is crucial for enhancing the HRQOL of patients. By using the proper resourcefulness strategy, that is, either personal (self-help) or social (help-seeking), nursing professionals can substantially contribute to enhancing the HRQOL for patients with PC.

In addition, the resolution of a typical medical image is insufficient for visualizing the bladder wall, which makes it more difficult to precisely evaluate the dose to the bladder wall. This simulation study aimed to quantitatively investigate the relationship between the dose received by organs at risk and the intravesical volume in prostate radiotherapy. The high-resolution Visible Chinese Human phantom and the finite element method were used to construct 10 pelvic models with specific intravesical volumes ranging from 100 ml to 700 ml to represent bladders of patients with different bladder filling capacities during radiotherapy. This series of models was utilized in six-field coplanar 3D conformal radiotherapy simulations with different planning target volume (PTV) margins. Each organ's absorbed dose was calculated using the Monte Carlo method. The obtained bladder wall displacements during bladder filling were consistent with reported clinical measurements. The radiotherapy simulation revealed a linear relationship between the dose to non-targeted organs and the intravesical volume and indicated that a 10-mm PTV margin for a large bladder and a 5-mm PTV margin for a small bladder reduce the effective dose to the bladder wall to similar degrees. However, larger bladders were associated with evident protection of the intestines.

However, informative IHC analysis depends on both the specificity and affinity of the binding reagent, which are inherently difficult to quantify in situ. Here we describe a label-free method that allows for the direct and real-time assessment of molecular binding kinetics in situ on FFPE tissue specimens using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) enabled biosensor technology. We analysed the interaction between the rVAR2 protein and its placental-like chondroitin sulfate (pl-CS) receptor in primary human placenta tissue and in breast and prostate tumour specimens in situ. rVAR2 interacted with FFPE human placenta and cancer tissue with an affinity in the nanomolar range, and showed no detectable interaction with pl-CS negative normal tissue. We further validated the method by including analysis with the androgen receptor N-20 antibody (anti-AR). As the KD value produced by this method is independent of the number of epitopes available, this readout offers a quantitative and unbiased readout for in situ binding-avidity and amount of binding epitopes. In summary, this method adds a new and important dimension to classical IHC-based molecular pathology by adding information about the binding characteristics in biologically relevant conditions.

There are currently no commercially available assays to detect AR splice variants. The branched chain RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) platform enables the highly sensitive detection of RNA transcripts in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.  Experimental design:   We designed a branched chain RNA ISH probe to target the unique cryptic exon CE3 of AR-V7 using multiple tiling probes. This automated ISH assay was applied to tumor tissue from two distinct clinical cohorts that we hypothesized would differ in AR-V7 status.  Results:   We detected AR-V7 in all tumor samples from men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with tissue obtained after disease progression despite at least one subsequent line of hormonal therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or bicalutamide; n = 12). We detected AR-V7 in just one tumor from men who had undergone prostatectomy for localized adenocarcinoma (n = 30; Gleason 4 + 5 = 9 in the AR-V7-positive sample). Given the apparent distinction between the above groups by AR-V7 signal, we analyzed pretreatment AR-V7 status as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in men with treatment-naïve metastatic disease. Patients with metastases but without detectable AR-V7 RNA at baseline had significantly longer overall survival (log-rank P = 0.044) and a trend toward superior progression-free survival (log-rank P = 0.055).  Conclusions:   Within an institutional cohort, the RNA ISH assay identified AR-V7 within FFPE tissue and may have prognostic value in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.

The second aim was to compare the original ""Venezuelan"" chicken model described by Sotelo to our training model. Our training model consists of performing an anastomosis, reproducing the surgical procedure in ""vivo"" as in RARP, between proventriculus and the proximal portion of the esophagus. A posterior fascial reconstruction simulating Rocco's stitch is performed between the tissues located under the posterior surface of the esophagus and the tissue represented by the serosa of the proventriculus. From 2014 to 2015, during 6 different full-immersion training courses, thirty-four surgeons performed the urethrovesical anastomosis using our model and the Sotelo's one. After the training period, each surgeon was asked to fill out a non-validated questionnaire to perform an evaluation of the differences between the two training models. Our model was judged the best model, in terms of similarity with urethral tissue and similarity with the anatomic unit urethra-pelvic wall. Our training model as reported by all trainees is easily reproducible and anatomically comparable with the urethrovesical anastomosis as performed during radical prostatectomy in humans. It is suitable for performing posterior fascial reconstruction reported by Rocco.

Purpose To evaluate LCC using different MRI sequences for determining ECE in prostate cancer. Material and Methods A total of 185 patients underwent prostate MRI followed by radical prostatectomy. LCC was measured separately on T2-weighted (T2W) images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. LCCs (LCCT2, LCCADC, LCCDCE, and LCCmax [greatest value of 3 LCCs]) were compared between sequences using Wilcoxon signed rank test and was tested for determining ECE using the Mann-Whitney U test, ROC curve analysis, and logistic regression analysis. Results There were no significant differences among LCCs ( P = 0.333-0.837). All LCCs were significantly greater in patients with ECE ( P < 0.001). The optimal threshold value for predicting ECE was >14, >13, >12, and >14 mm for LCCT2, LCCADC, LCCDCE, and LCCmax, respectively. LCCmax yielded the highest area under the curve (0.895) which was significantly greater than that by LCCADC (0.858, P = 0.030). Otherwise, there were no significant difference between LCCs ( P = 0.052-0.985). At univariate analysis, age, clinical stage, PSA, Gleason score, and all LCCs were significantly associated with ECE ( P < 0.001-0.040). At multivariate analysis, GS ( P ≤ 0.008) and all LCCs ( P < 0.001) were independently predictive factors. Conclusion LCC measured on any sequence was significantly different in patients with and without ECE and was independently associated with the presence of ECE.

Interpretation of results is complicated by the nature of prostate tissue, which consists of four distinct compartments: vascular, ductal lumen, epithelium, and stroma. Current diffusion measurements are an ill-defined weighted average of these compartments. In this study, prostate diffusion is analyzed in terms of a model that takes explicit account of tissue compartmentalization, exchange effects, and the non-Gaussian behavior of tissue diffusion.  Method:   The model assumes that exchange between the cellular (ie, stromal plus epithelial) and the vascular and ductal compartments is slow. Ductal and cellular diffusion characteristics are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation and a two-compartment exchange model, respectively. Vascular pseudodiffusion is represented by an additional signal at b = 0. Most model parameters are obtained either from published data or by comparing model predictions with the published results from 41 studies. Model prediction error is estimated using 10-fold cross-validation.  Results:   Agreement between model predictions and published results is good. The model satisfactorily explains the variability of ADC estimates found in the literature.

We hypothesized that the αvβ3 integrin is transferred through exosomes and, upon transfer, has the ability to support functional aberrations in recipient cells. Here, for the first time, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is present in exosomes released from metastatic PC3 and CWR22Pc prostate cancer cells. Exosomal β3 is transferred as a protein from donor to nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cells as β3 protein or mRNA levels remain unaffected upon transcription or translation inhibition in recipient cells. Furthermore, it is shown that upon exosome uptake, de novo expression of an αvβ3 increases adhesion and migration of recipient cells on an αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin. To evaluate the relevance of these findings, exosomes were purified from the blood of TRAMP mice carrying tumors where the expression of αvβ3 is found higher than in exosomes from wild-type mice. In addition, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is coexpressed with synaptophysin, a biomarker for aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer.  Implications:   Overall this study reveals that the αvβ3 integrin is transferred from tumorigenic to nontumorigenic cells via exosomes, and its de novo expression in recipient cells promotes cell migration on its ligand. The increased expression of αvβ3 in exosomes from mice bearing tumors points to its clinical relevance and potential use as a biomarker.

The tumor environment of neuroendocrine prostate cancer is heterogeneous and characterized by hypoxia, necrosis, and numerous mitoses. Although acidic extracellular pH has been implicated in aggressive cancer features including metastasis and therapeutic resistance, its role in neuroendocrine prostate cancer physiology and metabolism has not yet been explored. We used the well-characterized PNEC cell line as a model to establish the effects of extracellular pH (pH 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5) on neuroendocrine prostate cancer cell metabolism. We discovered that alkalinization of extracellular pH converted cellular metabolism to a nutrient consumption-dependent state that was susceptible to glucose deprivation, glutamine deprivation, and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) mediated inhibition of glycolysis. Conversely, acidic pH shifted cellular metabolism toward an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent state that was susceptible to OXPHOS inhibition. Based upon this mechanistic knowledge of pH-dependent metabolism, we identified that the FDA-approved anti-helminthic niclosamide depolarized mitochondrial potential and depleted ATP levels in PNEC cells whose effects were enhanced in acidic pH. To further establish relevance of these findings, we tested the effects of extracellular pH on susceptibility to nutrient deprivation and OXPHOS inhibition in a cohort of castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B, PC-3, and PC-3M. We discovered similar pH-dependent toxicity profiles among all cell lines with these treatments. These findings underscore a potential importance to acidic extracellular pH in the modulation of cell metabolism in tumors and development of an emerging paradigm that exploits the synergy of environment and therapeutic efficacy in cancer.""","""['Joseph E Ippolito', 'Matthew W Brandenburg', 'Xia Ge', 'Jan R Crowley', 'Kristopher M Kirmess', 'Avik Som', ""D Andre D'Avignon"", 'Jeffrey M Arbeit', 'Samuel Achilefu', 'Kevin E Yarasheski', 'Jeffrey Milbrandt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Combining p53 stabilizers with metformin induces synergistic apoptosis through regulation of energy metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Subtype and Site Specific-Induced Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic plasticity of metastatic breast cancer cells: adaptation to changes in the microenvironment.', 'Current status of androgen receptor-splice variant 7 inhibitor niclosamide in castrate-resistant prostate-cancer.', 'Emerging Variants of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Constitutively Active Androgen Receptor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Detachment stress mediated bioenergetic switch of malignant melanoma cells into anti-Warburg phenotype.', 'Sorafenib and nitazoxanide disrupt mitochondrial function and inhibit regrowth capacity in three-dimensional models of hepatocellular and colorectal carcinoma.']"""

This study was designed to determine if lovastatin might reduce the incidence of late rectal injury in patients receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate receiving radiotherapy with curative intent were eligible. A portion of the rectum had to receive at least 60 Gy. Gastrointestinal functioning was assessed using both physician-reported and patient-reported instruments at baseline and at prescribed intervals during and after treatment. Lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) was started on day 1 of radiation and continued for 12 months. Patients were followed for an additional 12 months.

Using the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model system, we report that a hypofractionated radiation schedule (10 Gy/day for 5 consecutive days) effectively blocks prostate tumor growth in wild type (β1wt /TRAMP) mice as well as in mice carrying a conditional ablation of β1 integrins in the prostatic epithelium (β1pc-/- /TRAMP). Since JNK is known to be suppressed by β1 integrins and mediates radiation-induced apoptosis, we tested the effect of SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in the TRAMP model system. Our results show that SP600125 negates the effect of radiation on tumor growth in β1pc-/- /TRAMP mice and leads to invasive adenocarcinoma. These effects are associated with increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression and phosphorylation in prostate tumors in β1pc-/- /TRAMP mice. In marked contrast, radiation-induced tumor growth suppression, FAK expression and phosphorylation are not altered by SP600125 treatment of β1wt /TRAMP mice. Furthermore, we have reported earlier that abrogation of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in prostate cancer cells enhances the sensitivity to radiation. Here we further explore the β1/IGF-IR crosstalk and report that β1 integrins promote cell proliferation partly by enhancing the expression of IGF-IR. In conclusion, we demonstrate that β1 integrin-mediated inhibition of JNK signaling modulates tumor growth rate upon hypofractionated radiation.""","""['Aejaz Sayeed', 'Huimin Lu', 'Qin Liu', 'David Deming nd', 'Alexander Duffy', 'Peter McCue', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Roger J Davis', 'Dmitry Gabrilovich', 'Ulrich Rodeck', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['β1 integrins mediate resistance to ionizing radiation in vivo by inhibiting c-Jun amino terminal kinase 1.', 'beta1A integrin expression is required for type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor mitogenic and transforming activities and localization to focal contacts.', 'The insulin-like growth factor axis and prostate cancer: lessons from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.', 'beta1 integrin targeting to enhance radiation therapy.', 'The role of JNK in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic strategies.', 'Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Require β1 Integrins to Promote Anchorage-Independent Growth.', 'Adhesion- and stress-related adaptation of glioma radiochemoresistance is circumvented by β1 integrin/JNK co-targeting.', 'The c-Jun N-terminal kinase prevents oxidative stress induced by UV and thermal stresses in corals and human cells.']"""

Methylation status of the whole TERT gene in benign and malignant prostate samples was determined by MeDIP-Seq. The prognostic role of THOR in PCa was assessed by pyrosequencing on discovery and validation cohorts from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with long-term follow-up data.Most cancers (n = 3056) including PCa (n = 300) exhibited hypermethylation of THOR.

We used a sensitive, whole blood reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay that does not require circulating tumor cell enrichment to correlate outcomes of abiraterone with whole blood expression of AR-V7 and other prostate cancer associated transcripts.  Materials and methods:   We assessed the expression of AR-V7, FOXA1, GRHL2, HOXB13, KLK2, KLK3 and TMPRSS2:ERG mRNA in 2.5 ml whole blood from each of 27 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and 33 controls without cancer as the discovery cohort. Cycle threshold values of controls with the highest gene expression were set as the threshold for a positive test. Thresholds were then applied to a validation cohort of 37 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who were commencing abiraterone. Gene expression was correlated with the prostate specific antigen response rate using the chi-square test, and with time to prostate specific antigen progression and overall survival using the log rank test.  Results:   In the discovery cohort 3 of 27 patients (11.1%) with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer were AR-V7 positive vs 4 of 37 (10.8%) in the validation cohort.

Aim:   To analyze the 8-year follow-up effects of intramuscular TU therapy on metabolic parameters, urinary symptoms, bone mineral density, and sexual function and investigate CAG repeat lengths in men with LOH.  Methods:   We reviewed the medical records of 428 men with LOH who had been treated with TU and 5 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer during TU therapy. There were 120 patients (mean age = 65.6 ± 8.9 years) who had 5 to 8 years of continuous TU supplementation and sufficiently completed records for analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the CAG repeat region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Fragment analysis, sequencing, electropherography, and chromatography were performed.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome measure was dynamic parameter changes during testosterone supplementation.  Results:   TU did not improve all obesity parameters. A statistically significant decrease was found in waist circumference, percentage of body fat, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and International Prostate Symptom Score (P < .05). TU did not produce differences in body mass index, high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, or the Aging Male Symptoms score from baseline. However, a statistically significant increase was found in the level of testosterone, prostate-specific antigen, hematocrit, International Index of Erectile Function score, and vertebral and femoral bone mineral density (P < .05).

Methods:   This prospective phase I study was approved by the local ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Twenty patients with ≥1 cancer suspicious region (CSR) with a PI-RADS score of ≥3 detected on the diagnostic multi-parametric MRI and no prior prostate treatment underwent MR-guided biopsy with the aid of the RCM. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system for reporting surgical complications. For evaluation of the workflow, procedure- and manipulation times were recorded.  Results:   All CSR's (n=20) were reachable with the MR-compatible RCM and the cancer detection rate was 70 %. The median procedure time was 36:44 minutes (range, 23 - 61 minutes) and the median manipulation time for needle guide movement was 5:48 minutes (range, 1:15 - 18:35 minutes). Two Clavien grade 1 complications were reported.  Conclusions:   It is feasible and safe to perform transrectal MR-guided prostate biopsy using a MR-compatible RCM as an aid. It is a fast and efficient way to biopsy suspicious prostate lesions with a minimum number of biopsies per patient.

Methods:   We retrospectively selected 81 patients who underwent (i) whole-gland HIFU ablation between 2007 and 2011 as first-line therapy or salvage treatment after radiotherapy or brachytherapy, and (ii) pre- and postoperative MRI. On preoperative imaging, two senior (R1, R2) and one junior (R3) readers assessed the number of sectors invaded by the lesion with the highest Likert score (dominant lesion) using a 27-sector diagram. On postoperative imaging, readers assessed destruction of the dominant lesion using a three-level score. Multivariate analysis included the number of sectors invaded by the dominant lesion, its Likert and destruction scores, the pre-HIFU prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and the clinical setting (primary/salvage).  Results:   The most significant predictor was the number of prostate sectors invaded by the dominant lesion for R2 and R3 (p≤0.001) and the destruction score of the dominant lesion for R1 (p = 0.011).

CK2 is overexpressed, especially in the nuclear compartment, in the majority of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). CK2-mediated activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 is a key step in cellular proliferation, resulting in translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. As CK2 expression and activity are also elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), we sought to increase the knowledge of CK2 function in benign and malignant prostate by examination of the relationships between nuclear CK2 and nuclear NF-κB p65 protein expression. The expression level and localization of CK2α and NF-κB p65 proteins in PCa and BPH tissue specimens was determined. Nuclear CK2α and NF-κB p65 protein levels are significantly higher in PCa compared with BPH, and these proteins are positively correlated with each other in both diseases. Nuclear NF-κB p65 levels correlated with Ki-67 or with cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 expression in BPH, but not in PCa. The findings provide information that combined analysis of CK2α and NF-κB p65 expression in prostate specimens relates to the disease status. Increased nuclear NF-κB p65 expression levels in PCa specifically related to nuclear CK2α levels, indicating a possible CK2-dependent relationship in malignancy. In contrast, nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels related to both Ki-67 and cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 levels exclusively in BPH, suggesting a potential separate impact for NF-κB p65 function in proliferation for benign disease as opposed to malignant disease.""","""['Fatima Qaiser', 'Janeen H Trembley', 'Sarah Sadiq', 'Iqbal Muhammad', 'Rubina Younis', 'Shoaib Naiyar Hashmi', 'Badar Murtaza', 'Thomas S Rector', 'Abdul Khaliq Naveed', 'Khalil Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Ki-67 and PCNA expression in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Suppression of casein kinase 2 sensitizes tumor cells to antitumor TRAIL therapy by regulating the phosphorylation and localization of p65 in prostate cancer.', 'Dual specificity phosphatase 1 expression inversely correlates with NF-κB activity and expression in prostate cancer and promotes apoptosis through a p38 MAPK dependent mechanism.', 'Heat Shock Proteins in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate stem cells in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer: emerging role and concepts.', 'Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'CSNK2 in cancer: pathophysiology and translational applications.', 'An Integrative Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Prognostic and Immunological Role of Casein Kinase 2 Alpha Protein 1 (CSNK2A1) in Human Cancers: A Study Based on Bioinformatics and Immunohistochemical Analysis.', 'CK2 Pro-Survival Role in Prostate Cancer Is Mediated via Maintenance and Promotion of Androgen Receptor and NFκB p65 Expression.', ""Neurotropin reduces memory impairment and neuroinflammation via BDNF/NF-κB in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.""]"""

It is recommended to avoid nerve sparing in high risk patients to avoid residual cancer. We report our intermediate term oncologic and functional outcomes in patients with preoperative D'Amico high risk prostate cancer, who underwent selective nerve sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Between Jan 2008 till June 2013, 557 patients underwent RARP for D'Amico high risk prostate cancer. The criteria for nerve sparing were as follows-complete: non palpable disease with <3 cores involvement on prostate biopsy; partial: non palpable disease with <4 cores involvement on prostate biopsy; none: clinically palpable disease with ≥4 cores involvement on prostate biopsy and intraoperative visual cues of locally advanced disease (loss of dissection planes, focal bulge of prostatic capsule). Degree of nerve sparing (NS) was graded intraoperatively by the surgeon independently at either side as side specific margins were assessed to predict subjectivity of the intraoperative judgment. Various data were collected and analyzed. Of 557 patients who underwent RARP 140 underwent complete (group 1), 358 patients underwent partial (group 2), and 59 patients underwent non-nerve-sparing procedure (group 3). There were no difference in preoperative characteristic between the groups (p = 0.678), but group 3 had higher Gleason score sum (p = 0.001), positive cores on biopsy (p = 0.001) and higher t stage (p = 0.001). Postoperatively Extra prostatic extension (p = 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.001), and tumor volume (p < 0.001) were higher in Group 3. Side specific positive surgical margins (PSMs) rates were higher for non-nerve-sparing compared to partial and complete nerve sparing RARP (p < 0.001; overall PSMs = 25.2 %). On univariate and multivariate analysis, nerve sparing did not affect PSMs (p > 0.05). The overall biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate at mean follow-up of 24.3 months was 19.21 %. The continence rate at 3 month was significantly higher in complete NS group in comparison to non-NS group (p = 0.020), however, this difference was not statistically significant at 1 year. Similarly, mean time to continence was significantly lower in complete NS group in comparison to non-NS group (p = 0.030). The potency rate was significantly higher and mean time to potency was significantly lower in complete NS group in comparison to non-NS group (p = 0.010 and 0.020, respectively). In high risk prostate cancer patients, selective nerve sparing during RARP, using the preoperative clinical variables (clinical stage and positive cores on biopsy) and surgeon's intraoperative perception, could provide reasonable intermediate term oncologic, functional outcomes (continence and potency) with acceptable perioperative morbidity and positive surgical margins rate. Use of these preoperative factors and surgeon's intraoperative judgment can appropriately evaluate high risk prostate cancer patients for nerve sparing RARP.""","""['Anup Kumar', 'Srinivas Samavedi', 'Anthony S Bates', 'Vladimir Mouraviev', 'Rafael F Coelho', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of preoperative factors including urodynamic evaluations and nerve-sparing status for predicting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Nerve-sparing technique contributes to the reduction of postprostatectomy incontinence.', 'RARP in high-risk prostate cancer: use of multi-parametric MRI and nerve sparing techniques.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Erectile function, urinary continence and oncologic outcomes of neurovascular bundle sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Selection of patients for nerve sparing surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Concordance between Preoperative mpMRI and Pathological Stage and Its Influence on Nerve-Sparing Surgery in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary seminal vesicle invasion rates in NCCN high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the treatment of patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: single surgeons functional and oncologic outcomes.']"""

Among the family of platinum (IV)-based compounds, a member known as CPA-7 inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cell lines. However, how and to what extent CPA-7 elicits its anti-prostate cancer effects in vivo is largely unknown.  Methods:   In this study, we firstly assessed the potential toxicity of the synthesized CPA-7 in a prostate cancer model as well as in normal mice. Next, we evaluated the in vitro effects of CPA-7 on the growth of prostate cancer cells using cell counting assay, and calculated the tumor sizes and cumulative survival rate of the tumor bearing mice by Kaplan-Meier method during CPA-7 treatment. Then we measured the expression level of the activated form of STAT3 (one targets of CPA-7) and its transcriptive activity post CPA-7 treatment by synergistically using western blot, IHC, and firefly luciferase reporter assays. Finally, effects of CPA-7 on immune cell trafficking in the tumor draining lymph nodes and in the spleens are evaluated with flow cytometry.  Results:   Treatment with CPA-7 significantly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and also in mice resulting in a prolonged survival and a decreased recurrence rate. These therapeutic effects are due, at least in part, to functional depletion of STAT3 in prostate tumor tissue as well as in the surrounding areas of tumor cell invasion. CPA-7 treatment also resulted in a reduced level of regulatory T cells and increased levels of cytotoxic T and T helper cells in the spleen and in tumor infiltrating lymph nodes. This favorable effect on immune cell trafficking may account for the amnestic immune response against recurrent prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   CPA-7 is a promising new therapeutic agent for prostate cancer that both inhibits tumor cell proliferation and stimulates anti-tumor immunity.

TRAPEZE was a two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial of zoledronic acid (ZA) and strontium-89 (Sr-89), each combined with docetaxel. All have palliative benefits, are used to control bone symptoms and are used with docetaxel to prolong survival. ZA, approved on the basis of reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), is commonly combined with docetaxel in practice, although evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness is lacking. Sr-89, approved for controlling metastatic pain and reducing need for subsequent bone treatments, is generally palliatively used in patients unfit for chemotherapy. Phase II analysis confirmed the safety and feasibility of combining these agents. TRAPEZE aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each agent.  Methods:   Patients were randomised to receive six cycles of docetaxel plus prednisolone: alone, with ZA, with a single Sr-89 dose after cycle 6, or with both. Primary outcomes were clinical progression-free survival (CPFS: time to pain progression, SRE or death) and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were SRE-free interval (SREFI), total SREs, overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Log-rank test and Cox regression modelling were used to determine clinical effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the NHS perspective and expressed as cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). An additional analysis was carried out for ZA to reflect the availability of generic ZA.  Patients:   757 randomised (median age 68.7 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score 0, 40%; 1, 52%; 2, 8%; prior radiotherapy, 45%); median prostate-specific antigen 143.78 ng/ml (interquartile range 50.8-353.9 ng/ml). Stratified log-rank analysis of CPFS was statistically non-significant for either agent (Sr-89, p = 0.11; ZA, p = 0.45). Cox regression analysis adjusted for stratification variables showed CPFS benefit for Sr-89 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.99; p = 0.036] and confirmed no effect of ZA (p = 0.46). ZA showed a significant SREFI effect (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; p = 0.008). Neither agent affected OS (Sr-89, p = 0.74; ZA, p = 0.91), but both increased total cost (vs. no ZA and no Sr-89, respectively); decreased post-trial therapies partly offset costs [net difference: Sr-89 £1341; proprietary ZA (Zometa(®), East Hanover, NJ, USA) £1319; generic ZA £251]. QoL was maintained in all trial arms; Sr-89 (0.08 additional QALYs) and ZA (0.03 additional QALYs) showed slight improvements. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Sr-89 was £16,590, with £42,047 per QALY for Zometa and £8005 per QALY for generic ZA.  Conclusion:   Strontium-89 improved CPFS, but not OS. ZA did not improve CPFS or OS but significantly improved SREFI, mostly post progression, suggesting a role as post-chemotherapy maintenance therapy. QoL was well maintained in all treatment arms, with differing patterns of care resulting from the effects of Sr-89 on time to progression and ZA on SREFI and total SREs. The addition of Sr-89 resulted in additional cost and a small positive increase in QALYs, with an ICER below the £20,000 ceiling per QALY. The additional costs and small positive QALY changes in favour of ZA resulted in ICERs of £42,047 (Zometa) and £8005 for the generic alternative; thus, generic ZA represents a cost-effective option. Additional analyses on the basis of data from the Hospital Episode Statistics data set would allow corroborating the findings of this study.

Although inflammation and abnormal smooth muscle contractions are known to play key roles in the development of LUTS, tissue fibrosis may also be an important and previously unrecognized contributing factor. Tissue fibrosis arises from the unregulated differentiation of fibroblasts or other precursor cell types into myofibroblasts, which is usually accomplished by activation of the TGFβ/TGFβR axis. Previously we reported that the CXC-type chemokines, CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12, which are up-regulated in the aging in the prostate, can drive this differentiation process as well in the absence of TGFβ. Based on this data we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms employed by CXCL12, and its receptor CXCR4, during prostate myofibroblast phenoconversion. The results of these studies suggest that CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated signaling events in prostate myofibroblast phenoconversion may proceed through non-canonical pathways that do not depend on TGFβ/TGFβR axis activation or Smad signaling. Here we report that CXCL12/CXCR4 axis activation promotes signaling through the EGFR and downstream MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways during myofibroblast phenoconversion, but not through TGFβ/TGFβR and downstream Smad signaling, in prostate fibroblasts undergoing myofibroblast phenoconversion. We document that EGFR transactivation is required for CXCL12-mediated signaling and expression of genes associate with myofibroblast phenoconversion (α-SMA, COL1a1). Our study successfully identified TGFβ/TGFβR-independent molecular mechanisms that promote CXCL12/CXCR4-induced myofibroblast phenoconversion.

As a common mechanism for secretion, lysosomes must first traffic to the cell periphery (anterograde trafficking), consistent with invasive cells often containing lysosomes closer to the plasma membrane compared to non-invasive cells. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transcriptionally driven program that promotes an invasive phenotype, and Zeb1 is one transcription factor that activates the mesenchymal gene expression program. The role of lysosome trafficking in EMT-driven invasion has not been previously investigated. We found that cells with increased levels of Zeb1 displayed lysosomes located closer to the cell periphery and demonstrated increased protease secretion and invasion in 3-dimensional (3D) cultures compared to their epithelial counterparts. Additionally, preventing anterograde lysosome trafficking via pharmacological inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) or shRNA depletion of ADP-ribosylation like protein 8b (Arl8b) reversed the invasive phenotype of mesenchymal cells, thus supporting a role for lysosome positioning in EMT-mediated tumor cell invasion. Immunoblot revealed that expression of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 correlated with Zeb1 expression. Furthermore, we found that the transcription factor Zeb1 binds to the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 promoter, suggesting that Zeb1 directly controls Na+/H+ transcription. Collectively, these results provide insight into a novel mechanism regulating Na+/H+ exchanger 1 expression and support a role for anterograde lysosome trafficking in Zeb1-driven cancer progression. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.""","""['Samantha S Dykes', 'ChongFeng Gao', 'William K Songock', 'Rebecca L Bigelow', 'George Vande Woude', 'Jason M Bodily', 'James A Cardelli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Lysosome trafficking is necessary for EGF-driven invasion and is regulated by p38 MAPK and Na+/H+ exchangers.', 'The transcription factor ZEB1 promotes an aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'HGF-induced invasion by prostate tumor cells requires anterograde lysosome trafficking and activity of Na+-H+ exchangers.', 'ZEB1: New advances in fibrosis and cancer.', 'ZEB1: Catalyst of immune escape during tumor metastasis.', 'Targeting Na-H exchanger 1 overcomes nuclear factor kappa B-mediated tumor resistance to radiotherapy.', 'Roles of the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1 and Urokinase in Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.', 'Shikonin suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by downregulating NHE1 in bladder cancer cells.', 'Sodium bicarbonate transporter NBCe1 regulates proliferation and viability of human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC3.', 'Pathophysiology of skeletal muscle disturbances in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).']"""

Nevertheless therapeutic options are mostly limited to surgery and radio-chemotherapy resulting in 5-year survival rates of around 50%. Therefore new therapeutic options are urgently needed. During the last years, targeting of receptor tyrosine kinases has emerged as a promising strategy that can complement standard therapeutical approaches. Here, we aimed at investigating if the receptor tyrosine kinase DDR2 is a targetable structure in HNSCC. DDR2 expression was assessed on a large HNSCC cohort (554 patients) including primary tumors, lymph node metastases and recurrences and normal mucosa as control. Subsequently, DDR2 was stably overexpressed in two different cell lines (FaDu and HSC-3) using lentiviral technology. Different tumorigenic properties such as proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion and anchorage independent growth were assessed with and without dasatinib treatment using in-vitro cell models and in-vivo zebrafish xenografts. DDR2 was overexpressed in all tumor tissues when compared to normal mucosa. DDR2 overexpression led to increased migration, invasion, adhesion and anchorage independent growth whereas proliferation remained unaltered. Upon dasatinib treatment migration, invasion and adhesion could be inhibited in-vitro and in-vivo whereas proliferation was unchanged. Our data suggest treatment with dasatinib as a promising new therapeutic option for patients suffering from DDR2 overexpressing HNSCC. Since dasatinib is already FDA-approved we propose to test this drug in clinical trials so that patients could directly benefit from this new treatment option.""","""['Anne von Mässenhausen', 'Christine Sanders', 'Johannes Brägelmann', 'Martina Konantz', 'Angela Queisser', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Stefan Duensing', 'Andreas Schröck', 'Friedrich Bootz', 'Peter Brossart', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Claudia Lengerke', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Overexpression of DDR2 contributes to cell invasion and migration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Elevated RET expression enhances EGFR activation and mediates EGFR inhibitor resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Genetic landscape of metastatic and recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Current challenges and clinical investigations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- and ErbB family-targeted agents in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).', 'Autophagic action of new targeting agents in head and neck oncology.', 'Cytomorphology and Gene Expression Signatures of Anchorage-independent Aggregations of Oral Cancer Cells.', 'Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by tumor microenvironmental signals and its implication in cancer therapeutics.', 'The Zebrafish model in dermatology: an update for clinicians.', 'Targeting Discoidin Domain Receptors DDR1 and DDR2 overcomes matrix-mediated tumor cell adaptation and tolerance to BRAF-targeted therapy in melanoma.', 'The Yin and Yang of Discoidin Domain Receptors (DDRs): Implications in Tumor Growth and Metastasis Development.']"""

Methods:   Proved by pathologic biopsy, 92 patients diagnosed with PCa and also underwent resection operation and 85 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were selected in this study, as well as 97 healthy volunteers were chosen as the control group. PBMC were extracted to examine the relative expression of miR-21 by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drew to analyze the diagnosis value of PCa. The survival function curves were made by Kaplan-Meier method to show the miR-21 expression levels of PCa patients. The Log-rank test was adopted to compare the differences among the different groups. The Cox proportional hazard risk regression analysis was used to screen the independent factors affected the PCa patients.  Results:   The expression levels of miR-21 in PCa group were increased compared to BPH and control group (P < 0.05). The expression of miR-21 was significantly correlated with the Gleason score, clinical stages, bone metastasis and tumor recurrence (all P < 0.05). ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve of PCa and BPH distinguished by the miR-21 were 0.974 and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 0.956∼ 0.993. The sensitivity and specificity were 93.5% and 92.9%.

Although the prevalence of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with localized prostate cancer who are unselected for family predisposition is insufficient to warrant routine testing, the frequency of such mutations in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has not been established.  Methods:   We recruited 692 men with documented metastatic prostate cancer who were unselected for family history of cancer or age at diagnosis. We isolated germline DNA and used multiplex sequencing assays to assess mutations in 20 DNA-repair genes associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes.  Results:   A total of 84 germline DNA-repair gene mutations that were presumed to be deleterious were identified in 82 men (11.8%); mutations were found in 16 genes, including BRCA2 (37 men [5.3%]), ATM (11 [1.6%]), CHEK2 (10 [1.9% of 534 men with data]), BRCA1 (6 [0.9%]), RAD51D (3 [0.4%]), and PALB2 (3 [0.4%]). Mutation frequencies did not differ according to whether a family history of prostate cancer was present or according to age at diagnosis. Overall, the frequency of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with metastatic prostate cancer significantly exceeded the prevalence of 4.6% among 499 men with localized prostate cancer (P<0.001), including men with high-risk disease, and the prevalence of 2.7% in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which includes 53,105 persons without a known cancer diagnosis (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   In our multicenter study, the incidence of germline mutations in genes mediating DNA-repair processes among men with metastatic prostate cancer was 11.8%, which was significantly higher than the incidence among men with localized prostate cancer. The frequencies of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with metastatic disease did not differ significantly according to age at diagnosis or family history of prostate cancer.

Targeted use of PSA screening may reduce overdiagnosis. Multimarker genomic testing shows promise for risk assessment and could be used to target PSA screening.  Methods:   To test whether counseling based on the family history (FH) and counseling based on a genetic risk score (GRS) plus FH would differentially affect subsequent PSA screening at 3 months (primary outcome), a randomized trial of FH versus GRS plus FH was conducted with 700 whites aged 40 to 49 years without prior PSA screening. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, recall, physician discussion at 3 months, and PSA screening at 3 years. Pictographs versus numeric presentations of genetic risk were also evaluated.  Results:   At 3 months, no significant differences were observed in the rates of PSA screening between the FH arm (2.1%) and the GRS-FH arm (4.5% with GRS-FH vs. 2.1% with FH: χ2 = 3.13, P = .077); however, PSA screening rates at 3 months significantly increased with given risk in the GRS-FH arm (P = .013). Similar results were observed for discussions with physicians at 3 months and PSA screening at 3 years. Average anxiety levels decreased after the individual cancer risk was provided (P = .0007), with no differences between groups. Visual presentation by pictographs did not significantly alter comprehension or anxiety.  Conclusions:   This is likely the first randomized trial of multimarker genomic testing to report genomic targeting of cancer screening.

WASF3 function is regulated through a protein complex that includes the NCKAP1 and CYFIP1 proteins. Here, we report that silencing NCKAP1 destabilizes the WASF3 complex, resulting in a suppression of the invasive capacity of breast, prostate, and colon cancer cells. In an in vivo model of spontaneous metastasis in immunocompromized mice, loss of NCKAP1 also suppresses metastasis. Activation of the WASF protein complex occurs through interaction with RAC1, and inactivation of NCKAP1 prevents the association of RAC1 with the WASF3 complex. Thus, WASF3 depends on NCKAP1 to promote invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that stapled peptides targeting the interface between NCKAP1 and CYFIP1 destabilize the WASF3 complex and suppress RAC1 binding, thereby suppressing invasion. Using a complex-disrupting compound identified in this study termed WANT3, our results offer a mechanistic proof of concept to target this interaction as a novel approach to inhibit breast cancer metastasis.

Then, this study investigated the combinational effect of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer and aging or smoking on comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer.  Methods:   This study included 754 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (n = 319) and radical prostatectomy (n = 435) from 2000 through 2013. The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined.  Results:   During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Saiji Ohga', 'Tomonari Sasaki', 'Katsumasa Nakamura', 'Hiroshi Honda', 'Masatoshi Eto']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study.', 'External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis.', 'The Patient Burden of Bladder Outlet Obstruction after Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Surgery Versus Radiotherapy for Clinically-localized Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Impact of Advanced Radiotherapy on Second Primary Cancer Risk in Prostate Cancer Survivors: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'An overview of patients with urothelial bladder cancer over the past two decades: a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) study.', 'The Impact of Radiotherapy on the Incidence of Secondary Malignancies: A Pan-Cancer Study in the US SEER Cancer Registries.', 'The Risk of Second Primary Cancers in Prostate Cancer Survivors Treated in the Modern Radiotherapy Era.', 'High prevalence of secondary bladder cancer in men on radiotherapy for prostate cancer: evidence from a meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   Cross-sectional study involved 562 men diagnosed with low-risk or intermediate-risk Pca (median time since diagnosis, 48mo), measuring preferred decision-making role (Control Preference Scale) and the evaluation of information received (EORTC QLQ-INFO25). Analyses were performed using analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and multivariable linear regression models.  Results:   Men who preferred a passive role were older and less educated than other preference groups and more often selected a noninvasive treatment option (all with P<0.001). The passive role preference group reported having received less information, judged the received information as less helpful, and indicated lower overall satisfaction with information received (all with P<0.05). Role preference groups did not differ in their desire to receive more information.  Conclusion:   Compared with nonpassive preference groups, the preference for a passive role in Pca treatment decision-making is associated with less satisfaction with the information received.

Meta-analyses combining the largest GWA meta-analysis data sets for these cancers totaling 112,349 cases and 116,421 controls of European ancestry, all together and in pairs, identified at P < 10(-8) seven new cross-cancer loci: three associated with susceptibility to all three cancers (rs17041869/2q13/BCL2L11; rs7937840/11q12/INCENP; rs1469713/19p13/GATAD2A), two breast and ovarian cancer risk loci (rs200182588/9q31/SMC2; rs8037137/15q26/RCCD1), and two breast and prostate cancer risk loci (rs5013329/1p34/NSUN4; rs9375701/6q23/L3MBTL3). Index variants in five additional regions previously associated with only one cancer also showed clear association with a second cancer type. Cell-type-specific expression quantitative trait locus and enhancer-gene interaction annotations suggested target genes with potential cross-cancer roles at the new loci. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of death receptor signaling genes near loci with P < 10(-5) in the three-cancer meta-analysis.  Significance:   We demonstrate that combining large-scale GWA meta-analysis findings across cancer types can identify completely new risk loci common to breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. We show that the identification of such cross-cancer risk loci has the potential to shed new light on the shared biology underlying these hormone-related cancers.

In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity of these radiopharmaceuticals, the short-lived radionuclide Ga-68 offers almost ideal nuclear characteristics for use in PET. Ga-68 is obtained from a germanium-gallium-generator system, so that the availability of Ga-68-labeled radiotracers is independent of an on-site-cyclotron regardless of the short half-life of Ga-68 of about 68minutes. Regarding the disposal of the radioactively contaminated waste from the preparation of the radiopharmaceutical, the eluted Ga-68 has to be considered to be additionally contaminated with its parent nuclide Ge-68.

The effect of miR‑30a overexpression on CRPC cell lines and the predicted target gene, CCNE2, were evaluated by MTT assay, flow cytometry, tumor formation, luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. miR‑30a overexpression resulted in a significant suppression of cell growth in vitro, and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. miR‑30a repressed the expression of CCNE2 through binding to its 3'‑untranslated region. CCNE2 was observed to be overexpressed in patients with CRCP and had an approximately inverse correlation with the level of miR‑30a. The results suggest that miR‑30a may function as a novel tumor suppressor in CRPC. Its anti‑oncogenic activity may occur by the reduced expression of a distinct cell cycle protein, CCNE2.""","""['Lei Zhang', 'Xiao-Wen Zhang', 'Chun-Hui Liu', 'Kai Lu', 'Ye-Qing Huang', 'Yi-Duo Wang', 'Li Xing', 'Li-Jie Zhang', 'Ning Liu', 'Hua Jiang', 'Chao Sun', 'Yu Yang', 'Shu-Qiu Chen', 'Ming Chen', 'Bin Xu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['MicroRNA-19a regulates proliferation and apoptosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by targeting BTG1.', 'Overexpression of microRNA-30a-5p inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting MTDH/PTEN/AKT pathway.', 'Androgen receptor-mediated downregulation of microRNA-221 and -222 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CD73/NT5E is a target of miR-30a-5p and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The role of microRNA in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A γ-Secretase Inhibitor Attenuates Cell Cycle Progression and Invasion in Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: An In Vitro Study.', 'Curcumin inhibits prostate cancer progression by regulating the miR-30a-5p/PCLAF axis.', 'CARM1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression through upregulating CCNE2 expression.', 'MicroRNA-211 expression is down-regulated and associated with poor prognosis in human glioma.', 'Micrornas in prostate cancer: an overview.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prospectively collected data from men who underwent prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Rates of adverse pathological features and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were compared between tumours positive, negative or 'equivocal' for LVI. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of BCR.  Results:   Of 1 310 consecutive cases, LVI was present definitively in 82 (6.3%) and equivocally in 43 (3.3%) cases. Similar to definitive LVI, equivocal LVI was significantly associated with other adverse pathological features, including advanced stage, higher Gleason grade and positive surgical margins. BCR occurred more frequently in patients with tumours that were equivocal (61%) or positive for LVI (71%) than in patients with negative results (14.7%). In addition, patients with both definitive and equivocal LVI had a significantly shorter BCR-free survival time compared with those with negative LVI. Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that the presence of either definitive or equivocal LVI were independent predictors of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-4.8; P <0.001 vs HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05-2.65; P = 0.032, respectively).

The age-specific incidence patterns exhibited remarkable shifts to younger ages, and declining rates were observed at old ages. Similar trends were seen in Norway. We investigate whether these features could, in combination with PSA testing, be explained by a varying degree of susceptibility to prostate cancer in the populations. We analyzed incidence data from the United States' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for 1973-2010, comprising 511,027 prostate cancers in men ≥40 years old, and Norwegian national incidence data for 1953-2011, comprising 113,837 prostate cancers in men ≥50 years old. We developed a frailty model where only a proportion of the population could develop prostate cancer, and where the increased risk of diagnosis due to the massive use of PSA testing was modelled by encompassing this heterogeneity in risk. The frailty model fits the observed data well, and captures the changing age-specific incidence patterns across birth cohorts. The susceptible proportion of men is [Formula: see text] in the United States and [Formula: see text] in Norway. Cumulative incidence rates at old age are unchanged across birth cohort exposed to PSA testing at younger and younger ages. The peaking cohort-specific age-incidence curves of prostate cancer may be explained by the underlying heterogeneity in prostate cancer risk. The introduction of the PSA test has led to a larger number of diagnosed men. However, no more cases are being diagnosed in total in birth cohorts exposed to the PSA era at younger and younger ages, even though they are diagnosed at younger ages. Together with the earlier peak in the age-incidence curves for younger cohorts, and the strong familial association of the cancer, this constitutes convincing evidence that the PSA test has led to a higher proportion, and an earlier timing, of diagnoses in a limited pool of susceptible individuals.""","""['Morten Valberg', 'Tom Grotmol', 'Steinar Tretli', 'Marit B Veierød', 'Tron A Moger', 'Susan S Devesa', 'Odd O Aalen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Epidemiol""","""['Prostate cancer incidence as an iceberg.', 'Overdiagnosis due to prostate-specific antigen screening: lessons from U.S. prostate cancer incidence trends.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing patterns in the recent prostate cancer incidence decline in the United States.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Heterogeneity in risk of prostate cancer: A Swedish population-based cohort study of competing risks and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Prostate cancer incidence as an iceberg.']"""

Methazolamide, an inhibitor of cytochrome c, was added to examine its blockade effect on BBM. PC-3 cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, and BBM or saline was administrated intravenously. Diameters of induced tumors were compared, and ratios of apoptotic cells in tumor tissues were calculated.  Results:   BBM inhibited viability of cultured PC-3 and LNCaP cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Flow cytometry showed BBM induced apoptosis in cultured cells. Mitochondria showed swelling, vacuolization and fused mitochondrial cristae. Western blot and real-time PCR analysis both showed increases of bax/bcl-2, active caspase-9 and active caspase-3. Methazolamide impeded effect of BBM on inducing apoptosis of cultured cells, and activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were also inhibited. Growth of tumors by grafted PC-3 cells was significantly slower in BBM group. Ratios of apoptotic cells in tumors were significantly higher in BBM group.

Between 2005 and 2012, we identified 50 men who underwent whole-gland HIFU following histological confirmation of localised disease following prior external beam radiotherapy (2005-2012). No upper threshold was applied for risk category, PSA or Gleason grade either at presentation or at the time of failure. Progression was defined as a composite with biochemical failure (Phoenix criteria (PSA>nadir+2 ng ml(-1))), start of systemic therapies or metastases.  Results:   Median age (interquartile range (IQR)), pretreatment PSA (IQR) and Gleason score (range) were 68 years (64-72), 5.9 ng ml(-1) (2.2-11.3) and 7 (6-9), respectively. Median follow-up was 64 months (49-84). In all, 24/50 (48%) avoided androgen-deprivation therapies. Also, a total of 28/50 (56%) achieved a PSA nadir <0.5 ng ml(-1), 15/50 (30%) had a nadir ⩾0.5 ng ml(-1) and 7/50 (14%) did not nadir (PSA non-responders). Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72, 40 and 31%, respectively. Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 100, 94 and 87%, respectively. When comparing patients with PSA nadir <0.5 ng ml(-1), nadir ⩾0.5 and non-responders, a statistically significant difference in PFS was seen (P<0.0001).

This is one of the few studies to focus on male willingness to allow future research use of biospecimens.  Methods:   This study analyzed the future research consent questions from a prostate cancer biorepository study (N = 1931). The consent form asked two questions regarding use of samples in future studies (1) without and (2) with protected health information (PHI). Yes to both questions of use of samples was categorized as Yes-Always; Yes to without and No to with PHI was categorized as Yes-Conditional; No to without PHI was categorized as Never. We analyzed this outcome to determine significant predictors for consent to Yes-Always vs. Yes-Conditional.  Results:   99.33 % consented to future use of samples; 88.19 % consented to future use without PHI, and among those men 10.2 % consented to future use with PHI. Comparing Yes Always and Yes Conditional responses, bivariate analyses showed that race, family history, stage of cancer, and grade of cancer (Gleason), were significant at the α = 0.05 level. Using stepwise multivariable logistic regression, we found that African-American men were significantly more likely to respond Yes Always when compared to White men (p < 0.001).

To investigate the role of MYO6 in prostate cancer, immunohistochemical analysis was firstly applied to prostate cancer tissues and revealed that MYO6 was closely related with the Gleason score in prostate cancer. Then we used specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to downregulate MYO6 expression in DU145 and PC-3 cells and found that decreased MYO6 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, as determined by MTT and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry confirmed that the suppression of MYO6 promoted cell cycle arrest at the G2/M and sub-G1 phase in the DU145 cells. Furthermore, PathScan intracellular signaling array analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PRAS40 was downregulated in the DU145 cells following MYO6 knockdown. Knockdown of MYO6 downregulated the expression of AKT3 and upregulated the expression of PARP, as confirmed by western blot analysis.

The beneficial effects of coumestrol are well known in various biological processes including; neuroprotective effects on the nervous system, function of the female reproductive system, anti-bacterial properties, and anti-cancer effects. Although the anti-tumor activity of coumestrol has been demonstrated for ovarian, breast, lung, and cervical cancers, little is known of its effects on prostate cancer. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of coumestrol on two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP. Our results showed that coumestrol decreased proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in both PC3 and LNCaP cells. Moreover, effects of coumestrol on cell signaling pathways were investigated and it increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, P90RSK, and P53 proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner whereas phosphorylation of AKT was reduced by coumestrol under the same conditions for culture of PC3 and LNCaP cells. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction was induced by coumestrol as evidenced by a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9, the apoptotic proteins associated with mitochondria, also changed in response to coumestrol. Coumestrol also caused mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in an increase in ROS production in PC3 and LNCaP cells. These results suggest that coumestrol can inhibit progression of prostate cancer and may be a novel chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of prostate cancer via effects mediated via the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK cell signaling pathways.

The corresponding health impacts have not been quantified. We develop a quantitative method and present the results in two articles: 1. Hazard identification, exposure-response functions, and exposure, 2. Health impacts, and benefits of a program to reduce the exposure of the population. Here is the second article.  Methods:   The exposure-response functions derived in Part 1 (for liver and prostate cancer, renal dysfunction and cognitive development) are combined with the exposure data to calculate the impacts. The corresponding costs are calculated via DALY's and VOLY. A no-effect threshold is included via the marginal fraction of the collective exposure above the reference dose. The health benefits are the impacts in 2002 (before the exposure reduction program) minus the impacts in 2006 (since the program). They are compared to the costs, namely the public annual expenditures for reducing the population exposure.  Results:   Without threshold, estimated annual cases of liver cancer, prostate cancer and renal dysfunction are respectively 5.4, 2.8, 0.10 in 2002; and 2.0, 1.0, 0.04 in 2006. Annual IQ points lost (cognitive development) are respectively: 1 173 and 1 003. The annual cost of total impacts is 38.3 Million Euros (M€) in 2002 and 23.7 M€ in 2006. Comparing the benefit of 14.6 M€ with the 3.25 M€ spent for prevention, the program appears well justified. With threshold, the costs of the impacts are lower, respectively: 26.5 M€ in 2002 and 12.8 M€ in 2006, but the benefit is not very different: 13.7 M€.  Conclusion:   This is the first study that quantified chronic non genotoxic effects of chlordecone exposures in Guadeloupe. According to our results, preventive actions should be focused on pregnant women because of the high social cost of development impairment and also because their exposures decreased less rapidly than others. Prevention effort should be sustained as long as chlordecone remains in soils. Additional toxicological and epidemiological research would also be required for health endpoints that could not be taken into account (neurotoxicity of adults, autoimmune diseases and other developmental effects).""","""['Vincent Nedellec', 'Ari Rabl', 'William Dab']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Environ Health""","""['Public health and chronic low chlordecone exposure in Guadeloupe, Part 1: hazards, exposure-response functions, and exposures.', 'Chlordecone exposure and adverse effects in French West Indies populations.', 'Visuospatial processing and fine motor function among 7-years old Guadeloupe children pre- and postnatally exposed to the organochlorine pesticide chlordecone.', 'Chlordecone-induced hepatic dysfunction.', 'Determination of a site-specific reference dose for methylmercury for fish-eating populations.', 'Critical Evaluation of Cross-Sectoral Collaborations to Inform the Implementation of the ""One Health"" Approach in Guadeloupe.', 'Neonatal exposure to chlordecone alters female social behaviors and central estrogen alpha receptor expression in socially monogamous mandarin voles.']"""

In the present study, we found that sulforaphane-cysteine (SFN-Cys), as a metabolite of SFN, inhibits invasion and possesses a novel mechanism in prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells. The scratch and Transwell assays showed that SFN-Cys (15 µM) inhibited both migration and invasion, with cell morphological changes, such as cell shrinkage and pseudopodia shortening. The cell proliferation (MTS) assay indicated that cell viability was markedly suppressed with increasing concentrations of SFN‑Cys. Furthermore, the Transwell assay showed that inhibition of SFN‑Cys‑triggered invasion was tightly linked to the sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Western blot analysis revealed that SFN-Cys downregulated galectin-1 protein, an invasion‑related protein, and that the galectin‑1 reduction could be blocked by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (25 µM). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression level of galectin-1 protein was significantly reduced in the cells treated with SFN‑Cys.

In order to clarify the prognostic role of p16 and to draw conclusions on interactions with key molecular features of prostate cancer, we studied p16 expression in a tissue microarray (TMA) with more than 12,400 prostate cancers and attached clinical, pathological, and molecular data such as ERG status and deletions of 3p13, 5q21, 6q15, and PTEN. p16 immunostaining was absent in non-neoplastic prostate cells but was found in 37 % of 9627 interpretable prostate cancers. Finding p16 expression in 58 % of ERG positive but in only 22 % of ERG negative cancers (p < 0.0001), highlights the known androgen-dependence of both genes. Significant associations between p16 upregulation and tumor phenotype or patient prognosis were strictly limited to the subset of ERG negative cancers. For example, p16 positivity increased from 15 % in Gleason ≤3 + 3 to 38 % in Gleason ≥4 + 4 cancers (p < 0.0001) and was associated with early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). p16 upregulation was strongly linked to deletions of PTEN (p < 0.0001), highlighting the interaction of both genes in growth control.

Aim:   We therefore investigated the interplay between proinflammatory cytokines and (PSMA,PSA) sub-groups.  Materials and methods:   27 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 18 prostate cancers (PC) were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Serum levels of PSA were assayed by Immulite autoanalyser.  Results:   In BPH and PC patients with elevated serum PSA levels, IL-1α was the most proinflammatory cytokine expressed in (PSMA+,PSA-) subgroup. However, most samples of (PSMA+,PSA+) subgroup had positive immunoreaction to IL-6. In samples of PC with PSA serum levels of 4-20ng/mL or >20ng/mL, immunoreaction to TNF-α was seen only in (PSMA+,PSA+) subgroup. Interestingly, several combinations of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1α and TNF-α) showed that coexpression of tissue PSMA and PSA was concomitant with high immunoreactions to (IL-6+,TNF-α-), (IL-6+,IL-1α+) and (IL-1α+,TNFα-) in BPH and PC patients. (PSMA,PSA) subgroup lacking tissue PSA expression showed a high immunoexpression of the profile (IL-6+,TNF-α-).

Materials and methods:   This phase II evaluation of focal laser ablation included men with stage T1c-T2a, prostate specific antigen less than 15 ng/ml or prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml3, Gleason 7 or less in 25% or less of biopsies and magnetic resonance imaging with 1 or 2 lesions concordant with biopsy detected cancer. At 3 months all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging with biopsy of ablation zone(s). At 12 months all underwent magnetic resonance imaging and systematic biopsy. I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) and SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) scores were collected before focal laser ablation, and at 1, 3 and 12 months. The primary end point was no cancer on the 3-month ablation zone biopsy. Secondary end points were safety, 12-month biopsy, and urinary and sexual function.  Results:   In the 27 men median age was 62 years and mean prostate specific antigen was 4.4 ng/ml. Biopsy Gleason score was 6 in 23 patients (85%) and Gleason 7 in 4 (15%). Seven men (26%) had low volume Gleason 6 disease outside the intended ablation zone(s). At 3 months 26 patients (96%) had no evidence of cancer on magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy of the ablation zone. No significant I-PSS changes were observed (each p >0.05). SHIM was lower at 1 month (p = 0.03), marginally lower at 3 months (p = 0.05) and without a significant difference at 12 months (p = 0.38). At 12-month biopsy cancer was identified in 10 patients (37%), including in the ablation zone(s) in 3 (11%) and outside the ablation zone(s) in 8 (30%) with cancer in and outside the ablation zone in 1.

The AR (androgen receptor) signaling axis remains active in castration resistant prostate cancer. Recent studies suggest that expression of the AR-V (AR splice variant) AR-V7 may underlie resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. However, controversy exists over the optimal assay. Our objective was to develop a fast and sensitive assay for AR-Vs in patients.  Materials and methods:   Two approaches were assessed in this study. The first approach was based on depletion of leukocytes and the second one used RNA purified directly from whole blood preserved in PAXgene® tubes. Transcript expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Through a side-by-side comparison we found that the whole blood approach was suitable to detect AR-Vs. The specificity of the assay was corroborated in a cancer-free cohort. Using the PAXgene assay samples from a cohort of 46 patients with castration resistant prostate cancer were analyzed. Overall, AR-V7 and ARv567es were detected in 67.53% and 29.87% of samples, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a strong association of AR-V positivity with a history of second line hormonal therapies.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that PAXgene preserved whole blood can be used to obtain clinically relevant information regarding the expression of 2 AR-Vs. These data on a castration resistant prostate cancer cohort support a role for AR-Vs in resistance to therapies targeting the AR ligand-binding domain.""","""['Xichun Liu', 'Elisa Ledet', 'Dongying Li', 'Ary Dotiwala', 'Allie Steinberger', 'Allison Feibus', 'Jianzhuo Li', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Jonathan Silberstein', 'Benjamin Lee', 'Yan Dong', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Haitao Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Blood Based Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 or 9 in Whole Blood Does Not Predict Response to Androgen-Axis-targeting Agents in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Standardization of CTC AR-V7 PCR assay and evaluation of its role in castration resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'AR-V7 Transcripts in Whole Blood RNA of Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Correlate with Response to Abiraterone Acetate.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy-based targeted gene screening highlights tumor cell subtypes in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'The Prognostic Value of Liquid Biopsies for Benefit of Salvage Radiotherapy in Relapsed Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy Based Circulating Biomarkers in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variant shows heterogeneous expression in prostate cancer according to differentiation stage.']"""

Materials and methods:   A brief survey was sent to 1229 members of the French society of urology in order to identify their indications of prostate MRI and its impact on patient management. The urologists were asked to answer several questions regarding age, practice modality, prostate MRI examinations (technique, indication before first biopsy, second biopsy, cancer staging, active surveillance, recurrence, focal therapy) and quality of reports.  Results:   A total of 445 responses were received (participation rate of 36%). The mean delay for obtaining an appointment for prostate MRI ranged between 15-30 days in 54%. Fifty-four percent of MRI reports contained a PIRADS score and 23% a Likert score. The indications of multiparametric-MRI were tumor detection/location prior to repeat biopsy (90%), cancer staging (85%), management of patients under active surveillance (85%), selection of candidates to focal therapy (63%), tumor detection/location in biopsy naïve patients (53%), detection of local recurrence after radical (51%).

Incomplete sampling of CaP multiclonality has limited the implications for molecular subtyping, stratification, and systemic treatment.  Objective:   To determine the impact of genomic and transcriptomic diversity within and among intraprostatic CaP foci on CaP molecular taxonomy, predictors of progression, and actionable therapeutic targets.  Design, setting, and participants:   Four consecutive patients with clinically localized National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk CaP who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy underwent radical prostatectomy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in June-July 2014. Presurgical information on CaP content and a customized tissue procurement procedure were used to isolate nonmicroscopic and noncontiguous CaP foci in radical prostatectomy specimens. Three cores were obtained from the index lesion and one core from smaller lesions. RNA and DNA were extracted simultaneously from 26 cores with ≥90% CaP content and analyzed using whole-exome sequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and RNA sequencing.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Somatic mutations, copy number alternations, gene expression, gene fusions, and phylogeny were defined. The impact of genomic alterations on CaP molecular classification, gene sets measured in Oncotype DX, Prolaris, and Decipher assays, and androgen receptor activity among CaP cores was determined.  Results and limitations:   There was considerable variability in genomic alterations among CaP cores, and between RNA- and DNA-based platforms. Heterogeneity was found in molecular grouping of individual CaP foci and the activity of gene sets underlying the assays for risk stratification and androgen receptor activity, and was validated in independent genomic data sets. Determination of the implications for clinical decision-making requires follow-up studies.  Conclusions:   Genomic make-up varies widely among CaP foci, so care should be taken when making treatment decisions based on a single biopsy or index lesions.

Although bone metastases frequently occur in prostate cancer patients, the significance of PGE2 in stromal responses to the tumor is not known. In this study, we report that PGE2 and its receptor EP4 play a pivotal role in bone destruction and metastasis in an experimental metastasis model of prostate cancer in nude mice. Using human prostate cancer PC-3 cells that are stably transfected with luciferase, we showed that the development of bone metastasis was accompanied by increased osteoclastic bone resorption in the bone metastasis microenvironment, and could be abrogated by an EP4 receptor antagonist. The growth of PC-3 cells in vitro was not influenced by PGE2 or by the EP4 receptor. However, cell-cell interactions between fixed PC-3 cells and host osteoblasts induced PGE2 production and RANKL expression in the osteoblasts. Addition of an EP4 antagonist suppressed both PGE2 and RANKL expression induced by the PC3-osteoblast interaction, which would have consequent effects on osteoclast activation and osteolysis. These results indicate that the blockage of PGE2-EP4 signaling prevents the bone destruction required for prostate cancer metastases, and that this is, in part due to the abrogation of bone cell responses. The study provides further evidence that an EP4 antagonist is a candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer in the blockade of bone metastasis.""","""['Kenta Watanabe', 'Tsukasa Tominari', 'Michiko Hirata', 'Chiho Matsumoto', 'Takayuki Maruyama', 'Gillian Murphy', 'Hideaki Nagase', 'Chisato Miyaura', 'Masaki Inada']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Role of prostaglandin E produced by osteoblasts in osteolysis due to bone metastasis.', 'Direct Melanoma Cell Contact Induces Stromal Cell Autocrine Prostaglandin E2-EP4 Receptor Signaling That Drives Tumor Growth, Angiogenesis, and Metastasis.', 'An EP4 antagonist ONO-AE3-208 suppresses cell invasion, migration, and metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Role of PGE2 in bone metastatic cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'Role of prostate and bone stromal cells on prostate cancer progression.', 'Eicosanoid regulation of debris-stimulated metastasis.', 'Eicosanoids in Cancer: Prostaglandin E2 Receptor 4 in Cancer Therapeutics and Immunotherapy.', 'Growth factors involve in cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration during prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

High activity has been proven in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel and in chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC. However, its activity in patients previously treated with other novel agents (for example, abiraterone and/or cabazitaxel), remains controversial.  Patients and methods:   The aim of this retrospective analysis of the Swiss Enzalutamide Named Patient Program was to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of enzalutamide treatment in patients with mCRPC progressing after docetaxel and other lines of therapy considering different treatment sequences. We report on 44 patients treated with enzalutamide.  Results:   The median survival time from diagnosis of CPRC was 41.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.3-49.8 months). Enzalutamide was used as a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh-line therapy in 13%, 20%, 31%, 20%, 11%, and 2% of patients. The median duration of enzalutamide treatment was 3.0 months (range, 1-21 months). Median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.4-3.7 months). The estimated median overall survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.1 months). Sixteen patients (36.4%) had a prostate-specific antigen decrease of ≥ 30%, and 11 patients (25.0%) of ≥ 50%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the absence of previous therapy with abiraterone and a prostate-specific antigen response of ≥ 50% on enzalutamide therapy were significantly associated with overall survival on enzalutamide treatment.

However, mechanisms of resistance to therapeutic androgen ablation are not well understood. Here, using a prostate cancer mouse model, Pten(pc-/-), carrying a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we show that the αvβ6 integrin is required for tumor growth in vivo of castrated as well as of noncastrated mice. We describe a novel signaling pathway that couples the αvβ6 integrin cell surface receptor to androgen receptor via activation of JNK1 and causes increased nuclear localization and activity of androgen receptor. This downstream kinase activation by αvβ6 is specific for JNK1, with no involvement of p38 or ERK kinase. In addition, differential phosphorylation of Akt is not observed under these conditions, nor is cell morphology affected by αvβ6 expression. This pathway, which is specific for αvβ6, because it is not regulated by a different αv-containing integrin, αvβ3, promotes upregulation of survivin, which in turn supports anchorage-independent growth of αvβ6-expressing cells. Consistently, both αvβ6 and survivin are significantly increased in prostatic adenocarcinoma, but are not detected in normal prostatic epithelium. Neither XIAP nor Bcl-2 is affected by αvβ6 expression. In conclusion, we show that αvβ6 expression is required for prostate cancer progression, including castrate-resistant prostate cancer; mechanistically, by promoting activation of JNK1, the αvβ6 integrin causes androgen receptor-increased activity in the absence of androgen and consequent upregulation of survivin. These preclinical results pave the way for further clinical development of αvβ6 antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated serum testosterone levels in 53 consecutive patients. Low testosterone was defined as <280 ng/dL and found in 30/53 patients (56.6%). Chi-square and Student t tests, Kaplan-Meier analysis, binary logistic regression, and Cox regression analysis were used to determine statistical significance.  Results:   Nearly all men with AUS cuff erosions had low serum testosterone (18/20, 90.0%) compared to those without erosions (12/33, 36.4%, P < .001). Mean time to erosion was 1.70 years (0.83-6.86); mean follow-up was 2.76 years (0.34-7.92). Low testosterone had a hazard ratio of 7.15 for erosion in a Cox regression analysis (95% confidence interval 1.64-31.17, P = .009) and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated decreased erosion-free follow-up (log-rank P = .002). Low testosterone was the sole independent risk factor for erosion in a multivariable model including coronary artery disease and radiation (odds ratio 15.78; 95% confidence interval 2.77-89.92, P = .002). Notably, history of prior AUS, radiation, androgen ablation therapy, or concomitant penile implant did not confound risk of cuff erosion in men with low testosterone levels.

Mc also altered the thermal stability of SENP1 in a newly developed cellular thermal shift assay, indicating that Mc directly interacts with SENP1 in PCa cells.

Compared to LNCaP and normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells, PC3 cells had higher levels of SENP1 mRNA and were more sensitive to Mc-induced growth inhibition. Mc also reduced SENP1 mRNA levels in PCa cells. Overexpression of SENP1 rescued PC3 cells from Mc-induced apoptosis.

Of these men 261 (87%) were classified as having NCCN very low or low risk disease at diagnosis. Disease reclassification on active surveillance was defined as the presence of 50% or more positive cores and/or surveillance prostate biopsy Gleason score upgrading. Patients with type I disease reclassification included those with any surveillance prostate biopsy Gleason score upgrading, while patients with type II reclassification had to have primary Gleason pattern 4-5 disease on surveillance prostate biopsy. Outcomes after initial surveillance prostate biopsy were evaluated using actuarial analyses.  Results:   At the time of initial surveillance prostate biopsy 49 (16%) and 19 (6%) patients had type I and type II disease reclassification, respectively. Those who underwent confirmatory biopsy had significantly reduced rates of type I (9% vs 23%, p=0.001) and type II (3% vs 9%, p=0.01) reclassification at initial surveillance prostate biopsy.

GHRH antagonists, JMR-132 and JV-1-38 inhibit the growth of androgen-independent prostate tumors. Here we investigated the involvement of GHRH antagonists in proliferative and apoptotic processes. We used non-tumoral RWPE-1 and tumoral LNCaP and PC3 human prostatic epithelial cells, as well as an experimental model of human tumor PC3 cells. We evaluated the effects of JMR-132 and JV-1-38 antagonists on cell viability and proliferation in the three cell lines by means of MTT and BrdU assays, respectively, as well as on cell cycle and apoptotic process in PC3 cells. The expression levels of PCNA, p53, p21, CD44, Cyclin D1, c-myc, Bax and Bcl2 were determined in both in vivo and in vitro models by means of Western-blot and RT-PCR. GHRH antagonists suppressed cell proliferation and decreased the levels of the proliferation marker, PCNA, in the three cell lines and in PC3 tumor. GHRH antagonists led to an increase of cells in S-phase and a decrease in G1 and G2/M phases, and induced S-phase arrest and increase of apoptotic cells. The effects of GHRH-antagonists on cell cycle could be due to the changes observed in the expression of p21, p53, Bax, Bcl2, CD44, Cyclin D1, c-myc and caspase 3.

The early diagnosis and treatment of PCa are still challenging due to the lack of efficient tumor targeting agents in traditional managements. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in PCa, while only has limited expression in other organs, providing an ideal target for the diagnosis and therapy of PCa. The antibody library technique has opened the avenue for the discovery of novel antibodies to be used in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer. In this paper, by screening a large yeast display naive human single chain antibody fragment (scFv) library, we obtained a high affinity scFv targeting PSMA, called gy1. The gy1 scFv was expressed in E.coli and purified via a C terminal 6His tag. The binding affinity of gy1 was shown to be at the nanomolar level and gy1 can specifically bind with PSMA positive cancer cells, and binding triggers its rapid internalization through the endosome-lysosome pathway. The specific targeting of gy1 to PSMA positive tumor tissues was also evaluated in vivo. We showed that the IRDye800CW labeled gy1 can efficiently target and specifically distribute in PSMA positive tumor tissues after being injected into xenograft nude mice.

Aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor for dioxin-like compounds, functions as a transcription factor through dimerization with hypoxia-inducible factors 1β (HIF-1β) and inhibits the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The purpose of this study was to explore whether AHR can suppress hypoxia-induced VEGF production in prostate bone metastasis cells and repress neovascularization in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and, if so, through what mechanisms.  Methods:   PC-3 or LNCaP cells induced angiogenesis was detected by Matrigel-based tube formation assay, mRNA expression levels was measured by qRT-PCR, VEGF secretion level was determined by ELISA assay, respectively.  Results:   AHR activation inhibits hypoxia-induced adhesiveness and vasculogenesis of EPCs induced by PC-3 or LNCaP cells under hypoxia. Moreover, AHR activation suppressed hypoxia-induced VEGF production in PC-3 and LNCaP cells (48 ± 14% in PC-3, p = 0.000; 41 ± 14% in LNCaP, p = 0.000) by attenuating HIF-1α and HIF-1β level that in turn diminished the angiogenic ability of EPCs in vitro. Furthermore, we found the mRNA level of hypoxia-inducible factors 1α (HIF-1α) (1.54 ± 0.13 fold in PC-3, p = 0.002, 1.62 ± 0.12 fold in LNCaP, p = 0.001) and HIF-1β (1.67 ± 0.23 fold in PC-3, p = 0.007; 1.75 ± 0.26 fold in LNCaP, p=0.008) were upregulated in prostate cancer bone metastasis PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines in response to hypoxia, and revealed that the regulation of VEGF by HIF-1α and HIF-1β was possibly mediated by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.

Importantly, inducible miR-199a-3p expression in pre-established prostate tumors in NOD/SCID mice inhibited tumor growth. Using target prediction program and luciferase assays, we show mechanistically that CD44 is a direct functional target of miR-199a-3p in PCa cells. Moreover, miR-199a-3p also directly or indirectly targeted several additional mitogenic molecules, including c-MYC, cyclin D1 (CCND1) and EGFR. Taken together, our results demonstrate how the aberrant loss of a miRNA-mediated mechanism can lead to the expansion and tumorigenic activity of prostate CSCs, further supporting the development and implementation of miRNA mimics for cancer treatment.""","""['Ruifang Liu', 'Can Liu', 'Dingxiao Zhang', 'Bigang Liu', 'Xin Chen', 'Kiera Rycaj', 'Collene Jeter', 'Tammy Calhoun-Davis', 'Yandong Li', 'Tao Yang', 'Junchen Wang', 'Dean G Tang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MiR-199a-5p represses the stemness of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma stem cells by targeting Sirt1 and CD44ICD cleavage signaling.', 'miR-199a-3p inhibits aurora kinase A and attenuates prostate cancer growth: new avenue for prostate cancer treatment.', 'MicroRNA-199a targets CD44 to suppress the tumorigenicity and multidrug resistance of ovarian cancer-initiating cells.', 'Activation of Matrix Hyaluronan-Mediated CD44 Signaling, Epigenetic Regulation and Chemoresistance in Head and Neck Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Hyaluronan-CD44 interaction promotes oncogenic signaling, microRNA functions, chemoresistance, and radiation resistance in cancer stem cells leading to tumor progression.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as new tools for delivery of miRNAs in the treatment of cancer.', 'Identification of Potential Key Genes in Prostate Cancer with Gene Expression, Pivotal Pathways and Regulatory Networks Analysis Using Integrated Bioinformatics Methods.', 'MicroRNA-199a-3p promotes drug sensitivity in triple negative breast cancer by down-regulation of BRCA1.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.']"""

We investigated the prognostic significance of percent free PSA value (free PSA/total PSA × 100) in female patients with colorectal cancer.  Methods:   The serum concentrations of total and free PSA were measured by solid-phase two-site immunoradiometric assay in 184 patients.  Results:   The cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with percent free PSA value ≥35 was significantly better compared to that of patients with percent free PSA value <35 (CSS rate was 82.9 and 55.5 %, respectively; log-rank x2 = 8135, p = 0.004). In multivariate Cox analysis, this percent free PSA threshold value had independent prognostic significance (relative risk 0.27, 95 % confidence interval 0.11-0.64, p = 0.003).

Despite its prevalence, PCa has proven very difficult to propagate in vitro. PCa represents a complex organ-like multicellular structure maintained by the dynamic interaction of tumoral cells with parenchymal stroma, endothelial and immune cells, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The lack of PCa models that recapitulate this intricate system has hampered progress toward understanding disease progression and lackluster therapeutic responses. Tissue slices, monolayer cultures and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) fail to mimic the complexities of the PCa microenvironment or reproduce the diverse mechanisms of therapy resistance. Moreover, patient derived xenografts (PDXs) are expensive, time consuming, difficult to establish for prostate cancer, lack immune cell-tumor regulation, and often tumors undergo selective engraftments. Here, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using primary PCa and tumor initiating cells (TICs), three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering, genetic and morphometric profiling, and humanized mice to generate patient-derived organoids for examining personalized therapeutic responses in vitro and in mice co-engrafted with a human immune system (HIS), employing adaptive T-cell- and chimeric antigen receptor- (CAR) immunotherapy.

Here, we demonstrate a metal-linked immunosorbent assay (MeLISA) based on a robust signal amplification mechanism that faithfully replaces the essential element of the enzyme. As an enzyme-free alternative to ELISA, this methodology works by the detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP), prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) at concentrations of 0.1 ng mL(-1), 0.1 ng mL(-1) and 1 ng mL(-1) respectively.

Methodology:   Nine patients with histopathological proven primary PCa underwent (68)Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT followed by radical prostatectomy. Resected prostates were scanned by ex-vivo CT in a special localizer and histopathologically prepared. Histopathological information was matched to ex-vivo CT. PCa volume (PCa-histo) and non-PCa tissue in the prostate (NPCa-histo) were processed to obtain a PCa-model, which was adjusted to PET-resolution (histo-PET).

The packaging of miR-182 into exosomes was examined in MDA-MB-231 (MDA-182) breast cancer cells with miR-182 overexpression. Levels of mature miR-182 increased in exosomes in a dose-dependent manner compared to intracellular expression. Furthermore, co-culture of MDA-182 cells with naïve MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in an increase in mature miR-182 in the naïve cells, which was blocked by a chemical inhibitor of microvesicle formation.

Several factors, such as cell type, survival rate, proliferation rate, and gene and protein expression patterns, determine whether a particular cell line can be adapted to a 3D system. The 3D system may overcome some of the limitations of 2D cultures in terms of cell-cell communication and cell networks, which are essential for understanding differentiation, structural organization, shape, and extended connections with other cells or organs. Here, the effect of the anticancer drug cisplatin, also known as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) or CDDP, on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation was investigated using 3D spheroid-forming cells and real-time monitoring for 7 days. First, 12 cell lines were screened for their ability to form 3D spheroids: prostate (DU145), testis (F9), embryonic fibroblast (NIH-3T3), muscle (C2C12), embryonic kidney (293T), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial cell (A549), cervical cancer (HeLa), HeLa contaminant (HEp2), pituitary epithelial-like cell (GH3), embryonic cell (PA317), and osteosarcoma (U-2OS) cells. Of these, eight cell lines were selected: NIH-3T3, C2C12, 293T, SH-SY5Y, A549, HeLa, PA317, and U-2OS; and five underwent real-time monitoring of CDDP cytotoxicity: HeLa, A549, 293T, SH-SY5Y, and U-2OS. ATP generation was blocked 1 day after addition of 50 μM CDDP, but cytotoxicity in HeLa, A549, SH-SY5Y, and U-2OS cells could be visualized only 4 days after treatment. In 293T cells, CDDP failed to kill entirely the culture and ATP generation was only partially blocked after 1 day. This suggests potential CDDP resistance of 293T cells or metabolic clearance of the drug. Real-time monitoring and ATP measurements directly confirmed the cytotoxicity of CDDP, indicating that CDDP may interfere with mitochondrial activity.""","""['NamHuk Baek', 'Ok Won Seo', 'Jaehwa Lee', 'John Hulme', 'Seong Soo A An']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Monitoring the effects of doxorubicin on 3D-spheroid tumor cells in real-time.', 'Three dimensional spheroid cell culture for nanoparticle safety testing.', 'Differences in drug sensitivity between two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture systems in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.', 'Electromagnetic Field Could Protect SH-SY5Y Cells Against Cisplatin Cytotoxicity, But Not MCF-7 Cells.', 'The multilayered postconfluent cell culture as a model for drug screening.', 'The Antiproliferative Effect of Chloroform Fraction of Eleutherine bulbosa (Mill.)

This study aimed to evaluate the repeatability of 18F-NaF PET-derived SUV imaging metrics in individual bone lesions from patients in a multicenter study.  Methods:   Thirty-five castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with multiple metastases underwent 2 whole-body (test-retest) 18F-NaF PET/CT scans 3 ± 2 d apart from 1 of 3 imaging sites. A total of 411 bone lesions larger than 1.5 cm3 were automatically segmented using an SUV threshold of 15 g/mL. Two levels of analysis were performed: lesion-level, in which measures were extracted from individual-lesion regions of interest (ROI), and patient-level, in which all lesions within a patient were grouped into a patient ROI for analysis. Uptake was quantified with SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVtotal Test-retest repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation, critical percentage difference, and repeatability coefficient. The 95% limit of agreement (LOA) of the ratio between test and retest measurements was calculated.  Results:   At the lesion level, the coefficient of variation for SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVtotal was 14.1%, 6.6%, and 25.5%, respectively. At the patient level, it was slightly smaller: 12.0%, 5.3%, and 18.5%, respectively. ICC was excellent (>0.95) for all SUV metrics. Lesion-level 95% LOA for SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVtotal was (0.76, 1.32), (0.88, 1.14), and (0.63, 1.71), respectively.

Here, we have developed and performed preanalytical studies to assess the impact of the variability in scanning speed and in vendor-specific γ-camera on reproducibility and accuracy of the automated bone scan index (BSI).  Methods:   Two separate preanalytical studies were performed: a patient study and a simulation study. In the patient study, to evaluate the effect on BSI reproducibility, repeated bone scans were prospectively obtained from metastatic prostate cancer patients enrolled in 3 groups (Grp). In Grp1, the repeated scan speed and the γ-camera vendor were the same as that of the original scan. In Grp2, the repeated scan was twice the speed of the original scan. In Grp3, the repeated scan used a different γ-camera vendor than that used in the original scan. In the simulation study, to evaluate the effect on BSI accuracy, bone scans of a virtual phantom with predefined skeletal tumor burden (phantom-BSI) were simulated against the range of image counts (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 million) and separately against the resolution settings of the γ-cameras. The automated BSI was measured with a computer-automated platform. Reproducibility was measured as the absolute difference between the repeated BSI values, and accuracy was measured as the absolute difference between the observed BSI and the phantom-BSI values. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the generated data.  Results:   In the patient study, 75 patients, 25 in each group, were enrolled. The reproducibility of Grp2 (mean ± SD, 0.35 ± 0.59) was observed to be significantly lower than that of Grp1 (mean ± SD, 0.10 ± 0.13; P < 0.0001) and that of Grp3 (mean ± SD, 0.09 ± 0.10; P < 0.0001). However, no significant difference was observed between the reproducibility of Grp3 and Grp1 (P = 0.388). In the simulation study, the accuracy at 0.5 million counts (mean ± SD, 0.57 ± 0.38) and at 0.2 million counts (mean ± SD, 4.67 ± 0.85) was significantly lower than that observed at 1.5 million counts (mean ± SD, 0.20 ± 0.26; P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed in the accuracy data of the simulation study with vendor-specific γ-cameras (P = 0.266).  Conclusion:   In this study, we observed that the automated BSI accuracy and reproducibility were dependent on scanning speed but not on the vendor-specific γ-cameras.

There was no difference in positive margins (p = 0.79), length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.30), catheter days (p = 0.17), readmission (p = 0.33), or reoperation (p = 0.73) when comparing surgeon-only to resident-involved cases. Residents performing the BN step had no effect on BN margins (p = 0.73) or prolonged catheterization (p = 0.62). ORT was significantly prolonged if BTD was performed by a resident (233.0 vs 191.7 minutes, p < 0.0001). Residents performing anastomosis had no effect on prolonged catheter time (p = 0.62) or LOS (p = 0.20). Residents were more likely to be involved in at least one portion of RARP following the purchase of a Mimic simulator (Mimic Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA) in January 2012.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are able to deliver anticancer agents selectively into tumour cells, which highly express GnRH receptors. However, the effectiveness of different analogues as targeting moiety in drug delivery systems is rarely compared, and the investigated types of cancer are also limited. Therefore, we prepared selectively labelled, fluorescent derivatives of GnRH-I, -II and -III analogues, which were successfully used for drug targeting. In this manuscript, we investigated these analogues' solubility, stability and passive membrane permeability and compared their cellular uptake by various cancer cells. We found that these labelled GnRH conjugates provide great detectability, without undesired cytotoxicity and passive membrane permeability. The introduced experiments with these conjugates proved their reliable tracking, quantification and comparison. Cellular uptake efficiency was studied on human breast, colon, pancreas and prostate cancer cells (MCF-7, HT-29, BxPC-3, LNCaP) and on dog kidney cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney). Each of the three conjugates was taken up by GnRH-I receptor-expressing cells, but the different cells preferred different analogues. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time the high cell surface expression of GnRH-I receptors and the effective cellular uptake of GnRH analogues on human pharynx tumour (Detroit-562) cells. In summary, our presented results detail that the introduced conjugates could be innovative tools for the examination of the GnRH-based drug delivery systems on various cells and offer novel information about these peptides.

Methods:   Among the 2571 prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2011, a subset of 633 patients was randomly selected from the prospectively accrued cohort of the Regional Cancer Registry, among the 17 participating institutions. Treatment distributions were examined for patients at each individual prostate cancer risk, age and comorbidity level and analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Treatments with curative intent were observed less often when age increased (p < 0.001). We found no impact of the Charlson score on the selection of a curative treatment [HR 0.89, 95 % CI (0.70-1.15)]. A 20 % overtreatment rate was reported in low-risk prostate cancer patients. For younger patients (65-75 years) with high comorbidity score, a 14 % overtreatment rate was observed. Conversely, a 16 % undertreatment rate was reported in older patients >75 years without any significant comorbidity.

However, only limited data on its routine use are available and its effect on quality of life (QoL) has not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical benefit of (188)Re-HEDP in routine clinical care.  Patients and methods:   Prostate or breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases receiving (188)Re-HEDP as a routine clinical procedure were eligible for evaluation. Clinical benefit was assessed in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Pain palliation and QoL were monitored using the visual analogue scale (VAS), corrected for opioid intake, and the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global health status/QoL-scale. Thrombocyte and leukocyte nadirs were used to assess haematological toxicity.  Results:   45 and 47 patients were evaluable for pain palliation and QoL, respectively. After a single injection of (188)Re-HEDP, the overall pain response rate was 69% and mean VAS-scores decreased relevantly and significantly (p < 0.05). Repeated treatment resulted in similar pain response. The overall QoL response rate was 68% and mean Global health status/QoL-scores increased relevantly and significantly. Haematological side effects were mild and transient.

The objective of this study was to assess the treatment patterns and the overall survival (OS) outcomes in men with pN+prostate cancer using the National Cancer Data Base.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2004 and 2011, who underwent radical prostatectomy for pN+were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were stratified into subgroups of those receiving no adjuvant therapy and those receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT) alone, aRT alone, and aRT+aHT. OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the groups using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify covariates that affected OS.  Results:   A total of 7,225 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 3,636 (50.3%) received no adjuvant therapy, 2,041 (28.2%) received aHT alone, 350 (4.8%) received aRT alone, and 1,198 (16.5%) received aRT+aHT. The 5-year OS rates were 85.2% for no adjuvant therapy, 82.9% for aHT alone, 88.3% for aRT alone, and 88.8% for combination hormonal therapy, i.e., aRT+aHT (P<0.001). On multivariable analysis, aRT+aHT was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.54-0.83; P<0.001) compared with no adjuvant therapy, whereas aHT alone (HR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.85-1.15; P = 0.90) and aRT alone (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.74-1.40; P = 0.92) were not.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA/FOLH1) is expressed in the neovasculature of several types of cancer. However, the study of neovascular PSMA expression has been impeded as human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures are PSMA-negative and both tumor xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are not known to express PSMA in their vasculature. Therefore, PSMA expression was examined in HUVECs, in vitro and in vivo, and we tested the hypothesis that cancer cell-HUVEC crosstalk could induce the expression of PSMA in HUVECs. Interestingly, conditioned media from several cancer cell lines induced PSMA expression in HUVECs, in vitro, and these lines induced PSMA, in vivo, in a HUVEC coimplantation mouse model. Furthermore, HUVECs in which PSMA expression was induced were able to internalize J591, a mAb that recognizes an extracellular epitope of PSMA as well as nanoparticles bearing a PSMA-binding ligand/inhibitor. These findings offer new avenues to study the molecular mechanism responsible for tumor cell induction of PSMA in neovasculature as well as the biological role of PSMA in neovasculature. Finally, these data suggest that PSMA-targeted therapies could synergize with antiangiogenic and/or other antitumor agents and provide a promising model system to test therapeutic modalities that target PSMA in these settings.  Implications:   Cancer cells are able to induce PSMA expression in HUVECs, in vitro and in vivo, allowing internalization of PSMA-specific mAbs and nanoparticles bearing a PSMA-binding ligand/inhibitor.

The authors investigated how the net benefit of PSA screening varies between common practice versus ""good practice.""  Methods:   Microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) was used to evaluate the effect on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) if 4 recommendations were followed: limited screening in older men, selective biopsy in men with elevated PSA, active surveillance for low-risk tumors, and treatment preferentially delivered at high-volume centers. Outcomes were compared with a base model in which annual screening started at ages 55 to 69 years and were simulated using data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.  Results:   In terms of QALYs gained compared with no screening, for 1000 screened men who were followed over their lifetime, recommended good practice led to 73 life-years (LYs) and 74 QALYs gained compared with 73 LYs and 56 QALYs for the base model. In contrast, common practice led to 78 LYs gained but only 19 QALYs gained, for a greater than 75% relative reduction in QALYs gained from unadjusted LYs gained. The poor outcomes for common practice were influenced predominantly by the use of aggressive treatment for men with low-risk disease, and PSA testing in older men also strongly reduced potential QALY gains.  Conclusions:   Commonly used PSA screening and treatment practices are associated with little net benefit. Following a few straightforward clinical recommendations, particularly greater use of active surveillance for low-risk disease and reducing screening in older men, would lead to an almost 4-fold increase in the net benefit of prostate cancer screening.

Methods:   Men with mCRPC and non-progressive disease after a cumulative dose of ≥300 mg/m2 docetaxel for first line treatment were randomized 1:1 to receive orteronel 300 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from randomization to death or the combination of at least two of radiographic, clinical, or PSA progression. Ninety-six patients per arm were planned to demonstrate an improvement of median EFS from 4 months on placebo to 6.7 months on orteronel (hazard ratio (HR) 0.6; type I error 5% and power 90%).  Results:   Forty-seven patients (23 orteronel, 24 placebo) were randomized before premature closure of the trial because of discontinuation of clinical development of orteronel. Median EFS was 8.5 months with orteronel and 2.9 months with placebo (P = 0.001; HR 0.32; 95%CI 0.15-0.65). Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 8.5 and 2.8 months (P = 0.02; HR 0.42; 95%CI 0.20-0.91) in the orteronel and placebo arm, respectively.

Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) relapse, time to symptomatic metastasis and overall survival (OS) were also described for the two groups.  Patients and methods:   From 2005 to 2011, a total of 110 patients were randomised at a ratio of 1:1. HRQoL was assessed at six time points: before randomisation, before radiotherapy (RT) start and 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after randomisation, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ-PR25.  Results:   At the 3-month follow-up, statistically significant differences between the two groups were found for overall quality of life (p = 0.006), fatigue (p = 0.023), sexual interest (p < 0.001) and urinary problems (p = 0.036). Small clinical differences were noted for overall quality of life, role functioning, fatigue, pain, sleeping problems and urinary problems. At that assessment point, clinical differences between the groups were substantial regarding sexual interest and moderate regarding sexual functioning (the latter indicated only by patients reporting having sexual interest at baseline). All statistical and clinical differences favoured the androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy arm. At 18 months after randomisation, statistically significant differences were found for cognitive functioning (p = 0.040) and sexual interest (p = 0.011), both favouring the androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy arm.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that neo-adjuvant androgen receptor inhibitor monotherapy might be preferred compared to castration plus an androgen receptor inhibitor before curative intended RT in men with localised/locally advanced PC, with higher levels of HRQoL, especially concerning sexual interest. HRQoL differences over time were small. The observation time and study sample were too small for evaluating time to PSA progression and OS. Further studies are needed to confirm the results.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the oncological and urological outcomes of seven patients treated between 1992 and 2014 according to the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe protocols. Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study staging: local, six patients; and IV, one patient.  Histology:   embryonal, five patients; unclassified, one patient; triton tumor one patient. Surgical treatment included: cystectomy, uterectomy and partial vaginectomy, one patient; radical cystectomy, two patients; cystectomy, one patient; cystectomy with partial prostatectomy, one patient; partial cystectomy, one patient; and partial prostatectomy, one patient.  Results:   All patients were alive in complete remission at last follow up. In four cases, ileal conduit with ureteral reimplantation with serous-lined extramural tunnel (Abol-Enein technique) was carried out, which was followed by conversion into ileal continent bladder with continent appendiceal stoma for clean intermittent catheterization in three patients. In one boy, partial cystectomy and continent reconstruction was carried out during a single surgical procedure. One child with incontinent urinary diversion is still awaiting a continence solution. One child after partial prostatectomy is continent without any voiding disturbances.  Conclusions:   The timing and extent of radical surgery for treatment of genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma depend on the local anatomical conditions, and the response to previous chemo- and radiotherapy.

We examined the trend in obesity prevalence among cancer survivors in the United States in the past two decades and compared trends with those of adults without a history of cancer.  Patients and methods:   This was a population-based nationally representative sample of 538,969 noninstitutionalized US adults 18 to 85 years old with and without a history of cancer who participated in annual cross-sectional National Health Interview Surveys from 1997 to 2014. Obesity was defined as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) for non-Asians and body mass index ≥ 27.5 kg/m(2) for Asians.  Results:   Among 32,447 cancer survivors identified, the most common cancer diagnoses were breast (n = 6,948), prostate (n = 3,984), and colorectal (n = 2,546). From 1997 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity increased from 22.4% to 31.7% in cancer survivors and from 20.9% to 29.5% in adults without a history of cancer (P for trend < .001, both groups). Over this period, the estimated rate of annual increase in obesity prevalence was higher in women and men with a history of cancer compared with those without a history of cancer (all P for interaction < .001). The estimated rate of annual increase in obesity prevalence was 3.1% in female and 3.7% in male colorectal cancer survivors, 3.0% in breast cancer survivors, and 2.1% in prostate cancer survivors (all P < .001). In subgroup analyses, populations with the highest rates of increasing obesity burden were colorectal cancer survivors, breast cancer survivors, and non-Hispanic blacks.  Conclusion:   From 1997 to 2014, obesity increased more rapidly among adult cancer survivors compared with the general population. Colorectal and breast cancer survivors and non-Hispanic blacks were identified as being at the highest risk for obesity.""","""['Heather Greenlee', 'Zaixing Shi', 'Christine L Sardo Molmenti', 'Andrew Rundle', 'Wei Yann Tsai']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Trends in obesity and adiposity measures by race or ethnicity among adults in the United States 2011-18: population based study.', 'Racial and ethnic differences in health status and health behavior among breast cancer survivors--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2009.', 'Racial and Ethnic Differences in Dietary Intake, Physical Activity, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Among Cancer Survivors: 2005 and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS).', 'Black-white disparities in overweight and obesity trends by educational attainment in the United States, 1997-2008.', 'The physiology of obesity.', 'Potential involvement of circulating extracellular vesicles and particles on exercise effects in malignancies.', 'The effects of exercise and diet on oxidative stress and telomere length in breast cancer survivors.', 'Relationships between Obesity, Exercise Preferences, and Related Social Cognitive Theory Variables among Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in mortality among breast cancer survivors after a second malignancy.', 'Trends in Obesity Prevalence Among Patients Enrolled in Clinical Trials for Obesity-Related Cancers, 1986 to 2016.']"""

Here, we investigated whether capsazepine (Capz), a synthetic analogue of capsaicin, exerts anticancer effects by inhibiting STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells. Capz inhibited both constitutive and induced STAT3 activation in human prostate carcinoma cells. Capz also inhibited activation of the upstream kinases JAK1/2 and c-Src. The phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate reversed Capz-induced STAT3 inhibition, indicating that the effect of Capz depends on a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Capz treatment increased PTPε protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTPε reversed the Capz-induced induction of PTPε and inhibition of STAT3 activation, indicating that PTPε is crucial for Capz-dependent STAT3 dephosphorylation. Capz also decreased levels of the protein products of various oncogenes, which in turn inhibited proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis. Finally, intraperitoneal Capz administration decreased tumor growth in a xenograft mouse prostate cancer model and reduced p-STAT3 and Ki-67 expression. These data suggest that Capz is a novel pharmacological inhibitor of STAT3 activation with several anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jong Hyun Lee', 'Chulwon Kim', 'Seung Ho Baek', 'Jeong-Hyeon Ko', 'Seok Geun Lee', 'Woong Mo Yang', 'Jae-Young Um', 'Gautam Sethi', 'Kwang Seok Ahn']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Capsaicin is a novel blocker of constitutive and interleukin-6-inducible STAT3 activation.', 'Inhibition of JAK1/STAT3 signaling mediates compound K-induced apoptosis in human multiple myeloma U266 cells.', 'Physalin A exerts anti-tumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by suppressing JAK/STAT3 signaling.', 'Pleiotropic Pharmacological Actions of Capsazepine, a Synthetic Analogue of Capsaicin, against Various Cancers and Inflammatory Diseases.', 'The role of STAT3 signaling in mediating tumor resistance to cancer therapy.', 'Withaferin A: A Pleiotropic Anticancer Agent from the Indian Medicinal Plant Withania somnifera (L.)

However, the biological function of PCAT6 in lung cancer is still largely unknown. In this study, we found that PCAT6 is significantly increased in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and positively correlates with metastasis of lung cancer in patients. We then examined PCAT6 expression in lung cancer cell lines and identified that PCAT6 expression was significantly elevated in lung cancer cells compared to normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, especially in CL1-5 and H446 cells. PCAT6 knockdown significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and metastasis, as well as induced early apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Molecular analysis revealed that PCAT6 regulated the expression of two pivotal cancer-related proteins, c-Myc and p53, in lung cancer cells. However, PCAT6 was not directly combined with c-Myc and p53 as confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation. Finally, a retrospective study further revealed that PCAT6 negatively correlates with overall survival of lung cancer patients.

We have previously presented a program called HistoStitcher, which allows for more efficient manual reconstruction than general purpose image editing tools (such as Photoshop). However HistoStitcher is still manual and hence can be laborious and subjective, especially when doing large cohort studies. In this work we present AutoStitcher, a novel automated algorithm for reconstructing PWMHSs from digitized tissue fragments. AutoStitcher reconstructs (""stitches"") a PWMHS from a set of 4 fragments by optimizing a novel cost function that is domain-inspired to ensure (i) alignment of similar tissue regions, and (ii) contiguity of the prostate boundary. The algorithm achieves computational efficiency by performing reconstruction in a multi-resolution hierarchy. Automated PWMHS reconstruction results (via AutoStitcher) were quantitatively and qualitatively compared to manual reconstructions obtained via HistoStitcher for 113 prostate pathology sections.

They not only induce DNA demethylation but also have significant cytostatic and cytotoxic effects; however, the relationships between these characteristics have not been established yet due to the lack of a method to induce only DNA demethylation. Herein, we show that a fusion protein comprised of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) and the catalytic domain of Ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1-CD) globally demethylates and upregulates a number of methylated genes. These upregulated genes frequently contained CpG islands (CGIs) within ± 1000 bp of the transcription start site (TSS). Interestingly, 65% of the genes upregulated fivefold or more by MBD-TET1-CDwt were also reactivated after treatment with a DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (Aza-CR), suggesting that gene reactivation by both methods primarily shares the same mechanism, DNA demethylation. In order to examine whether DNA demethylation affects the growth of cancer cells, we have established a tetracycline inducible system that can regulate the expression of MBD-TET1-CDwt in a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. The induction of MBD-TET1-CDwt demethylated and upregulated glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), one of the hypermethylated genes in prostate cancer. In accordance with the reactivation of methylated genes, induction of MBD-TET1-CDwt extensively suppressed the growth of LNCaP cells through G1/S arrest. These results clearly indicate that TET oxidase activity recruited at methyl-CpG sites through MBD induces reactivation of hypermethylated genes by DNA demethylation and allows us to analyze the effect of only global DNA demethylation in a wide variety of cancer cells.""","""['Yasuhiko Mizuguchi', 'Yuriko Saiki', 'Akira Horii', 'Shinichi Fukushige']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 represses transcription from hypermethylated pi-class glutathione S-transferase gene promoters in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2 plays a key role in maintenance and spread of DNA methylation at CpG islands and shores in cancer.', 'Dual action on promoter demethylation and chromatin by an isothiocyanate restored GSTP1 silenced in prostate cancer.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Regulation of CpG methylation by Dnmt and Tet in pluripotent stem cells.', 'Aberrant Hypermethylation-Mediated Suppression of PYCARD Is Extremely Frequent in Prostate Cancer with Gleason Score\u2009≥\u20097.', 'Epigenetic inactivation of IRX4 is responsible for acceleration of cell growth in human pancreatic cancer.']"""

Evidence suggests that small incremental differences in the quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 on biopsy stratify disease extent, biochemical failure following surgery and eligibility for active surveillance. We explored the overall quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 levels and adverse outcomes in patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer to whom active surveillance may be offered under expanded criteria.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) or 7 (3 + 4) who underwent radical prostatectomy from January 2008 to August 2015. Age, prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4, overall percent positive cores (percent of prostate cancer) and clinical stage were explored as predictors of nonorgan confined disease and time to failure after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   In 1,255 patients biopsy Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) was associated with T3 or greater disease at radical prostatectomy in 35.0% compared with Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) in 19.0% (p <0.001). On multivariate analysis for each quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 increase there were 2% higher odds of T3 or greater disease (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, p <0.001). When stratified, patients with Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) only approximated the pT3 rates of Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) when prostate specific antigen was less than 8 ng/ml and the percent of prostate cancer was less than 15%. In those cases the quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 had less effect. Time to failure after radical prostatectomy was worse in Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) than 6 (3 + 3) cases.  Conclusions:   The quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 helps predict advanced disease and Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) is associated with worse outcomes. However, the impact of the quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 on adverse pathological and clinical outcomes is best used in combination with prostate specific antigen, age and disease volume since each has a greater impact on predicting nonorgan confined disease. The calculated absolute risk of T3 or greater can be used in shared decision making on prostate cancer treatment by patients and clinicians.""","""['Nathan Perlis', 'Rashid Sayyid', 'Andrew Evans', 'Theodorus Van Der Kwast', 'Ants Toi', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Rob Hamilton', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Neil E Fleshner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Percent of prostate needle biopsy cores with cancer is significant independent predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from SEARCH database.', 'Percent prostate needle biopsy tissue with cancer is more predictive of biochemical failure or adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy than prostate specific antigen or Gleason score.', 'Long-Term Outcomes after Deferred Radical Prostatectomy in Men Initially Treated with Active Surveillance.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Clinical and molecular rationale to retain the cancer descriptor for Gleason score 6 disease.', 'The highest percentage of Gleason Pattern 4 is a predictor in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Oncologic Outcomes of Total Length Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy in Men with Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer.', 'Metastasis and Mortality in Men With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Hyperpolarised 13C-MRI identifies the emergence of a glycolytic cell population within intermediate-risk human prostate cancer.', 'Grade group 2 (10%\u2009≥\u2009GP4) patients have very similar malignant potential with grade group 1 patients, given the risk of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

Although numerous methods for eliciting expert opinion as probability distributions exist, there is little research to suggest whether one method is more useful than any other method. This study had three objectives: (i) to obtain subjective probability distributions characterising parameter uncertainty in the context of a health technology assessment; (ii) to compare two elicitation methods by eliciting the same parameters in different ways; (iii) to collect subjective preferences of the experts for the different elicitation methods used.  Methods:   Twenty-seven clinical experts were invited to participate in an elicitation exercise to inform a published model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative treatments for prostate cancer. Participants were individually asked to express their judgements as probability distributions using two different methods - the histogram and hybrid elicitation methods - presented in a random order. Individual distributions were mathematically aggregated across experts with and without weighting. The resulting combined distributions were used in the probabilistic analysis of the decision model and mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and the expected values of perfect information (EVPI) were calculated for each method, and compared with the original cost-effectiveness analysis. Scores on the ease of use of the two methods and the extent to which the probability distributions obtained from each method accurately reflected the expert's opinion were also recorded.  Results:   Six experts completed the task. Mean ICERs from the probabilistic analysis ranged between £162,600-£175,500 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) depending on the elicitation and weighting methods used. Compared to having no information, use of expert opinion decreased decision uncertainty: the EVPI value at the £30,000 per QALY threshold decreased by 74-86 % from the original cost-effectiveness analysis. Experts indicated that the histogram method was easier to use, but attributed a perception of more accuracy to the hybrid method.  Conclusions:   Inclusion of expert elicitation can decrease decision uncertainty. Here, choice of method did not affect the overall cost-effectiveness conclusions, but researchers intending to use expert elicitation need to be aware of the impact different methods could have.""","""['Bogdan Grigore', 'Jaime Peters', 'Christopher Hyde', 'Ken Stein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['EXPLICIT: a feasibility study of remote expert elicitation in health technology assessment.', 'Developing a reference protocol for structured expert elicitation in health-care decision-making: a mixed-methods study.', 'A preliminary model-based assessment of the cost-utility of a screening programme for early age-related macular degeneration.', 'Informing Reimbursement Decisions Using Cost-Effectiveness Modelling: A Guide to the Process of Generating Elicited Priors to Capture Model Uncertainties.', 'Methods to elicit probability distributions from experts: a systematic review of reported practice in health technology assessment.', 'The Gap Between AI and Bedside: Participatory Workshop on the Barriers to the Integration, Translation, and Adoption of Digital Health Care and AI Startup Technology Into Clinical Practice.', 'Comprehensive Review of Methods to Assess Uncertainty in Health Economic Evaluations.', 'Structured expert elicitation to inform long-term survival extrapolations using alternative parametric distributions: a case study of CAR T therapy for relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.', 'Understanding current UK practice for the incidental identification of vertebral fragility fractures from CT scans: an expert elicitation study.', 'Heterogeneity in Survival with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Its Implications for Survival Extrapolations: A Case Study in Advanced Melanoma.']"""

We retrospectively evaluated 292 Japanese patients. The impact of the BED and ADT on treatment outcomes was investigated. Cox proportional hazard models were used for univariate and multivariate analysis with biological progression-free survival (bPFS) and clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) as the primary outcome measures. The median follow-up was 66 months. The bPFS and cPFS rates at 5-/7-years were 91.6/87.7% and 95.9/94.0%, respectively. When stratified by BED levels, the bPFS rates at 5-/7-years were 92.1/89.3% for <178.0 Gy2, and 91.2/86.0% for ≥178.0 Gy2 , respectively (P > 0.05).

For the univariate analysis, the use of ADT and its duration were significant predictors for bPFS, whereas BED was not significant. A multivariate analysis did not indicate the use of ADT itself was significant, however, when covariates were accounted for by the duration of ADT, the longer use of ADT was found to significantly improve bPFS. Although cPFS was associated neither with the BED levels nor ADT duration (P > 0.05), ADT duration had a trend of improving cPFS (P = 0.053). The higher levels of BED did not significantly impact bPFS for intermediate-risk PCa after LDR-BT with or without supplemental EBRT and ADT.

Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had had three or more GP consultations about cancer-related health problems before being referred to hospital. The secondary outcome was the interval between the patient first suspecting a problem and their seeing a hospital specialist.  Results:   34% of the patients included in the final analyses (426 of 1248) had visited a GP at least three times before referral to a hospital doctor. The odds ratios (reference: rectal cancer; adjusted for age, sex, language spoken at home, and socio-economic disadvantage index score) varied according to cancer type, being highest for pancreatic cancer (3.2; 95% CI, 1.02-9.9), thyroid cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.9-6.6), vulval cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.7-8.7) and multiple myeloma (2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.5), and lowest for patients with breast cancer (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8), cervical cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.1-2.1), endometrial cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.4) or melanoma (0.7; 95% CI, 0.3-1.5). Cancer type also affected the duration of the interval from symptom onset to seeing a hospital doctor; it took at least 3 months for more than one-third of patients with prostate or colon cancer to see a hospital doctor.  Conclusion:   Certain cancer types were more frequently associated with multiple GP visits, suggesting they are more challenging to recognise early.

Additionally, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that elicit signaling downstream of TrkB in the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

We wish to test if a cohort of men with inherited risk of mismatch repair defect through BRCA1/2 or Lynch Syndrome mutations represents a target population for prostate cancer testing.  Methods:   Fifty-eight men (aged 40-69 years) from families with a history of BRCA1/2 or HNPCC/Lynch mutations were invited to take part. Men with PSA >3.0 ng/ml were recommended to have transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsies.  Results:   Overall 1 of 7 (14 %) and 1 of 20 (5 %) men with BRCA1/2 mutations were positive for a diagnosis of prostate cancer. In men with Lynch syndrome, 1 of 4 (25 %) was diagnosed to have prostate cancer. The index case with Lynch syndrome harbours a heterozygous mutation in the mismatch repair MSH6 gene. Near to complete loss of MSH6 immunoreactivity in the prostate tumour supports silencing of the remaining MSH6 allele during prostate carcinogenesis.  Conclusion:   The finding of near-to-complete loss of MSH6 expression in affected men with a family history of Lynch Syndrome supports its mechanistic involvement during prostate carcinogenesis.

Several prognostic factors are already used in daily clinical practice, but factors related to stability of SBM are still unknown. Therefore, we designed this study to identify these prognostic factors.  Methods:   We retrospectively assessed 915 patients from solid tumors with commonly metastased into the bone treated at our department between January 2000 and January 2012. Lung cancer (NSCLC), breast and renal cancer listed in Table 1 are the most common solid tumors with bone metastasis in this study. Prostate carcinoma was excluded due to osteoblastic SBM with no influence for stability. We calculated overall survival (OS) and bone survival (BS; time between first diagnosis of bone metastases until death) with the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed prognostic factors for BS with the log-rank test and a Cox regression model separately for patients with stable and unstable SBM.  Results:   Median follow-up was 9.3 months. OS after 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years was 81, 62, 42, and 25 % in patients with stable SBM and 78, 57, 38, and 22 % in patients with unstable SBM (p = 0.851). BS was 57, 38, 22, and 5 % in the group of stable SBM after 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years. For patients with unstable SBM BS after 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years was 59, 39, 19, and 8 % (p = 0.755). In multivariate analysis we found male gender (HR = 1.27 [95 % CI 1.01-1.60], p = 0.04), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80 % (HR = 1.27 [95%CI 1.04-1.55], p = 0.02) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; HR = 2.77 [95%CI 1.99-3.86], p < 0.0001) to be independent prognostic factors for shortened survival in patients with stable SBM. Independent prognostic factors for unstable SBM were age per year (HR = 1.01 [95 % CI 1.0-1.02], p = 0.025), multiple SBM (HR = 1.35 [95 % CI 1.1-1.65], p = 0.003), and NSCLC (HR = 2.0 [95 % CI 1.43-2.80], p < 0.0001). Additionally, not wearing an orthopedic corset (HR = 0.77 [95 % CI 0.62-0.96], p = 0.02) was associated with prolonged BS in patients with unstable SBM and in both groups BS was significantly longer in patients without liver metastases (stable SBM: HR = 0.72 [95 % CI 0.56-0.92], p = 0.008; unstable SBM: HR = 0.71 [95 % CI 0.54-0.92], p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   Survival was equal for patients with stable and unstable SBM. However, prognostic factors differed in both groups and stability should therefore be considered in treatment decision-making.""","""['Robert J Wolf', 'Robert Foerster', 'Thomas Bruckner', 'Tilman Bostel', 'Ingmar Schlampp', 'Juergen Debus', 'Harald Rief;German Bone Research Group']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The influence of fractionated radiotherapy on the stability of spinal bone metastases: a retrospective analysis from 1047 cases.', 'Prognostic factors for survival of women with unstable spinal bone metastases from breast cancer.', 'Stability, prognostic factors and survival of spinal bone metastases in malignant melanoma patients after palliative radiotherapy.', 'Outcome and prognostic factors in single brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer.', 'Prognostic factors associated with survival in patients with symptomatic spinal bone metastases: a retrospective cohort study of 1,043 patients.', 'Outcomes of surgical treatments of spinal metastases: a prospective study.', 'A gene expression signature-based nomogram model in prediction of breast cancer bone metastases.', 'Outcomes and prognostic factors for surgically treated patients with breast cancer spine metastases.', 'The influence of fractionated radiotherapy on the stability of spinal bone metastases: a retrospective analysis from 1047 cases.']"""

Pinnacle3 SSIMRT plans consisting of 5, 10, and 15 identical 5 × 5 cm2 MLC defined segments and MU/segment values of 5 MU, 10 MU, and 20 MU were utilized and delivered at 600/300 MU/min. Independent of the number of segments the overshoot and undershoot at 600 MU/min were approximately ± 10%, ± 5%, and ± 2.5% for 5 MU/segment, 10 MU/segment, and 20 MU/segment, respectively. At 300 MU/min, each of these values is approximately halved. Interfractional variation of these effects (10 fractions), as well as dosimetric variations for intermediate segments, are reduced at the lower dose rate. QA point-dose measurements for a sample (n = 29) of head and neck SSIMRT beams were on average 2.9% (600 MU/min) and 1.7% (300 MU/min) higher than Pinnacle3 planned doses. In comparison for prostate beams (n = 46), measured point doses were 0.8% (600 MU/min) and 0.4% (300 MU/min) higher. The reduction in planned-measured point-dose discrepancies at 300 MU/min can be attributed in part to the inclusion of the first segment (overshoot) in the admixture of segments that deliver measured dose. Pinnacle3 plans for 10/9 head and neck/prostate treatments were adjusted by ± 0.5 MU to include the effects of overshoot and undershoot at 600 MU/min. Comparing original and adjusted plans for each site indicated that the original plan was preferred in 70% and 89% of head and neck and prostate cases, respectively. The disparity between planned and delivered treatment that this suggests can potentially be mitigated by treating SSIMRT at a dose rate below 600 MU/min.""","""['John Baines', 'Sylwia J Zawlodzka', 'Matthew L Parfitt', 'Brigid E Hickey', 'Andrew P Pullar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['The overshoot phenomenon in step-and-shoot IMRT delivery.', 'Dosimetry limitations and a dose correction methodology for step-and-shoot IMRT.', 'Improvements in dose accuracy delivered with static-MLC IMRT on an integrated linear accelerator control system.', 'Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.']"""

Here, we present an algorithm that automates part of this process, in particular the adaptation of voxel-based penalties within normal tissue. Thereby, the proposed algorithm explicitly considers a priori known physical limitations of photon irradiation. The efficacy of the developed algorithm is assessed during treatment planning studies comprising 16 prostate and 5 head and neck cases. We study the eradication of hot spots in the normal tissue, effects on target coverage and target conformity, as well as selected dose volume points for organs at risk. The potential of the proposed method to generate class solutions for the two indications is investigated. Run-times of the algorithms are reported. Physically constrained voxel-based penalty adaptation is an adequate means to automatically detect and eradicate hot-spots during IMRT planning while maintaining target coverage and conformity. Negative effects on organs at risk are comparably small and restricted to lower doses. Using physically constrained voxel-based penalty adaptation, it was possible to improve the generation of class solutions for both indications. Considering the reported run-times of less than 20 s, physically constrained voxel-based penalty adaptation has the potential to reduce the clinical workload during planning and automated treatment plan generation in the long run, facilitating adaptive radiation treatments.""","""['Niklas Wahl', 'Mark Bangert', 'Cornelis P Kamerling', 'Peter Ziegenhein', 'Gijsbert H Bol', 'Bas W Raaymakers', 'Uwe Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Toward truly optimal IMRT dose distribution: inverse planning with voxel-specific penalty.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'A DVH-guided IMRT optimization algorithm for automatic treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy replanning.', 'Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the patient.', 'Automated Radiotherapy Treatment Planning.', 'A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for intelligent automatic treatment planning of prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Improving efficiency of training a virtual treatment planner network via knowledge-guided deep reinforcement learning for intelligent automatic treatment planning of radiotherapy.', 'Operating a treatment planning system using a deep-reinforcement learning-based virtual treatment planner for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Intelligent inverse treatment planning via deep reinforcement learning, a proof-of-principle study in high dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Voxel-based automatic multi-criteria optimization for intensity modulated radiation therapy.']"""

Akt activation is important for Snail stabilization and transcription in PCa. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the relationship between the phosphorylated level of Akt (p-Akt) in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and cancer biochemical recurrence (BCR). Using a tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry, the expression of p-Akt was measured in benign and neoplastic tissues from RP specimens in 53 patients whose cancer was pathologically defined as T2 without positive margins. Herein, we observed that the p-Akt level was higher in PCa than in benign tissues and was significantly associated with the Snail level. A high p-Akt image score (≥8) was significantly correlated with a higher histological Gleason sum, Snail image score, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value. Moreover, the high p-Akt image score and Gleason score sum (≥7) showed similar discriminatory abilities for BCR according to a receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis and were correlated with worse recurrence-free survival according to a log-rank test (p < 0.05). To further determine whether a high p-Akt image score could predict the risk of BCR, a Cox proportional hazard model showed that only a high p-Akt image score (hazard ratio (HR): 3.12, p = 0.05) and a high Gleason score sum (≥7) (HR: 1.18, p = 0.05) but not a high preoperative PSA value (HR: 0.62, p = 0.57) were significantly associated with a higher risk of developing BCR.

Methods:   A fully automated analysis tool was used for a retrospective analysis of mpMRI sets (T2-weighted, T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted sequences). The software provided a malignancy prediction value for each image pixel, defined as Malignancy Attention Index (MAI) that can be depicted as a colour map overlay on the original images.

The impact of adherence on total medical costs was then evaluated using the generalized linear model (GLM) with the log-link function and gamma error distribution.  Results and discussion:   Of 1918 diabetic, cancer patients who newly initiated oral diabetic drugs, only 37·6% were adherent to oral diabetic medications; a similar proportion of adherence was found in the non-cancer control population (35·8%, P = 0·24). Younger age, living in the southern region, using combination therapy vs. monotherapy, and using retail pharmacy vs. mail order pharmacy were significantly associated with non-adherence in patients with cancer. Adherence to oral antidiabetic drugs was associated with 24% fewer all-cause hospitalizations (P = 0·02).  What is new and conclusion:   We identified high prevalence of non-adherence to oral antidiabetic medications as well as negative consequences associated with non-adherence, among patients with cancer. These findings may underscore the importance of developing relevant intervention strategies for improving diabetes management and treatment outcomes among cancer patients with diabetes.""","""['X Tan', 'X Feng', 'J Chang', 'G Higa', 'L Wang', 'D Leslie']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Pharm Ther""","""['Antiretroviral therapy adherence, medication use, and health care costs during 3 years of a community pharmacy medication therapy management program for Medi-Cal beneficiaries with HIV/AIDS.', 'Evaluation of the first year of a pilot program in community pharmacy: HIV/AIDS medication therapy management for Medi-Cal beneficiaries.', 'Determinants of adherence to diabetes medications: findings from a large pharmacy claims database.', 'Adherence to and persistence with antidiabetic medications and associations with clinical and economic outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic literature review.', 'A systematic review of adherence, treatment satisfaction and costs, in fixed-dose combination regimens in type 2 diabetes.', 'Metformin, placebo, and endocrine therapy discontinuation among participants in a randomized double-blind trial of metformin vs placebo in hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer (CCTG MA32).', 'Public Perceptions About Home Delivery of Medication Service and Factors Associated with the Utilization of This Service.', 'The association between cancer-related fatigue and diabetes from pre-chemotherapy to 6\xa0months post-chemotherapy.', 'Adherence to cardiovascular disease risk factor medications among patients with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Cardiovascular disease-related chronic conditions among Veterans Affairs nonmetastatic colorectal cancer survivors: a matched case-control analysis.']"""

In this study, we proposed a novel PSA-related parameter named PSA density variation rate (PSADVR) and designed a clinical trial to evaluate its potential diagnostic value for detecting PCa on a second prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Data from 184 males who underwent second ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy 6 months after the first biopsy were included in the study. The subjects were divided into PCa and non-PCa groups according to the second biopsy pathological results. Prostate volume, PSA density (PSAD), free-total PSA ratio, and PSADVR were calculated according to corresponding formulas at the second biopsy. These parameters were compared using t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test between PCa and non-PCa groups, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to evaluate their predictability on PCa detection.  Results:   PCa was detected in 24 patients on the second biopsy. Mean values of PSA, PSAD, and PSADVR were greater in the PCa group than in the non-PCa group (8.39 μg/L vs. 7.16 μg/L, 0.20 vs. 0.16, 14.15% vs. -1.36%, respectively). PSADVR had the largest area under the curve, with 0.667 sensitivity and 0.824 specificity when the cutoff was 10%. The PCa detection rate was significantly greater in subjects with PSADVR >10% than PSADVR ≤10% (28.6% vs. 6.5%, P< 0.001). In addition, PSADVR was the only parameter in this study that showed a significant correlation with mid-to-high-risk PCa (r = 0.63, P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that PSADVR improved the PCa detection rate on second biopsies, especially for mid-to-high-risk cancers requiring prompt treatment.""","""['Gan-Sheng Xie', 'Jin-Xing Lyv', 'Gang Li', 'Chun-Yin Yan', 'Jian-Quan Hou', 'Jin-Xian Pu', 'Xiang Ding', 'Yu-Hua Huang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Risk of repeat biopsy and prostate cancer detection after an initial extended negative biopsy: longitudinal follow-up from a prospective trial.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Optimal predictors of prostate cancer on repeat prostate biopsy: a prospective study of 1,051 men.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Current evidence and future perspectives about the role of iXip® in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Significant Diagnostic Value of Free-Serum PSA (FPSA)/Prostate-Specific Antigen Density (PSAD) and (F/T)/PSAD for Prostate Cancer of the Chinese Population in a Single Institution.']"""

Gleason score (GS) 9-10 CaP is particularly aggressive, and clinically-relevant endpoints occur early, facilitating meaningful comparisons.  Objective:   To compare outcomes of patients with GS 9-10 CaP following EBRT, extremely-dose escalated radiotherapy (as exemplified by EBRT+brachytherapy [EBRT+BT]), and RP.  Design, setting, participants:   Retrospective analysis of 487 patients with biopsy GS 9-10 CaP treated between 2000 and 2013 (230 with EBRT, 87 with EBRT+BT, and 170 with RP). Most radiotherapy patients received ADT and dose-escalated radiotherapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression estimated and compared 5-yr and 10-yr rates of distant metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS).  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 4.6 yr. Local salvage and systemic salvage were performed more frequently in RP patients (49.0% and 30.1%) when compared with either EBRT patients (0.9% and 19.7%) or EBRT+BT patients (1.2% and 16.1%, p<0.0001). Five-yr and 10-yr distant metastasis-free survival rates were significantly higher with EBRT+BT (94.6% and 89.8%) than with EBRT (78.7% and 66.7%, p=0.0005) or RP (79.1% and 61.5%, p<0.0001). The 5-yr and 10-yr CSS and OS rates were similar across all three cohorts.  Conclusions:   Radiotherapy and RP provide equivalent CSS and OS. Extremely dose-escalated radiotherapy with ADT in particular offers improved systemic control when compared with either EBRT or RP. These data suggest that extremely dose-escalated radiotherapy with ADT might be the optimal upfront treatment for patients with biopsy GS 9-10 CaP.  Patient summary:   While some prostate cancers are slow-growing requiring many years, sometimes decades, of follow-up in order to compare between radiation and surgery, high-risk and very aggressive cancers follow a much shorter time course allowing such comparisons to be made and updated as treatments, especially radiation, rapidly evolve. We showed that radiation-based treatments and surgery, with contemporary standards, offer equivalent survival for patients with very aggressive cancers (defined as Gleason score 9-10). Extremely-dose escalated radiotherapy with short-course androgen deprivation therapy offered the least risk of developing metastases, and equivalent long term survival.""","""['Amar U Kishan', 'Talha Shaikh', 'Pin-Chieh Wang', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Jonathan Said', 'Govind Raghavan', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'William J Aronson', 'Ahmad Sadeghi', 'Mitchell Kamrava', 'David Jeffrey Demanes', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Local Therapy for Gleason 9-10 Prostate Cancer: Looking to the Future.', 'Re: Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treated With Radiotherapy or Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-institutional Comparative Analysis.', 'Re: Amar U.

The decrease in PSA level was observed in 125 cases (52.3%). Rate of PSA decline ＞50 and ＞25% were 18.4 and 43.1, respectively, and rate of PSA best response (PSA decline ＞ 50%) was 32.6%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that long duration of prior CAB therapy, Estracyt○R - pretreatment PSA value and bone metastasis influenced progression-free survival significantly. Adverse events were observed in 127 cases (38.6%). The major adverse events were anorexia which was observed in 35 cases (10.9%), gastrointestinal disorders observed in 32 cases (9.7%), abnormal laboratory test values observed in 31 cases (9.4%) and gynecomastia observed in 16 cases (4.9%). These results suggest the clinical efficacy and safety of Estracyt○R for chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and Estracyt○R is regarded as one of the treatment options for patients with CRPC, especially for patients who had long duration of prior CAB therapy.""","""['Kazunori Murachi', 'Tadashi Kumagai', 'Tatsunori Masuda', 'Tadaharu Nakanishi', 'Shinichi Tanaka', 'Koyuki Tajima', 'Yasushi Takebe', 'Takayuki Oda']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hinyokika Kiyo""","""['Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effective and Safe Administration of Low-Dose Estramustine Phosphate for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy of estramustine phosphate sodium hydrate (EMP) monotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: report of 102 cases and review of literature.', 'Understanding prostate-specific antigen dynamics in monitoring metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for clinical practice.', 'Chemotherapy with or without estramustine for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

However, due of its nonenzymatic nature, development of suitable strategies to block its protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction is challenging. Thus, c-Myc has been recognized as an elusive molecular target for cancer control, and various approaches are in development to inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity. We observed that wedelolactone (WDL), an anti-inflammatory botanical compound, severely downregulates the expression of c-Myc mRNA in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, WDL dramatically decreases the protein level, nuclear accumulation, DNA-binding, and transcriptional activities of c-Myc. c-Myc is a transforming oncogene widely expressed in prostate cancer cells and is critical for maintaining their transformed phenotype. Interestingly, WDL was found to strongly affect the viability of Myc-activated prostate cancer cells and completely block their invasion as well as soft agar colony formation in vitro WDL was also found to downregulate c-Myc in vivo in nude mice xenografts. Moreover, WDL synergizes with enzalutamide to decrease the viability of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells via induction of apoptosis. These findings reveal a novel anticancer mechanism of the natural compound WDL, and suggest that the oncogenic function of c-Myc in prostate cancer cells can be effectively downregulated by WDL for the development of a new therapeutic strategy against Myc-driven prostate cancer.

Methods:   The clinical data of 894 patients who received TRUS-guided biopsy and prior MRI test from a large Chinese center was reviewed. Based on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring, all MRIs were re-reviewed and assigned as Grade 0-2 (PI-RADS 1-2; PI-RADS 3; PI-RADS 4-5). We constructed two models both in predicting PCa and HGPCa (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3): Model 1 with MRI and Model 2 without MRI. Other clinical factors include age, digital rectal examination, PSA, free-PSA, volume, and TRUS.  Results:   PCa and HGPCa were present in 434 (48.5 %) and 218 (24.4 %) patients. An MRI Grade 0, 1, and 2 were assigned in 324 (36.2 %), 193 (21.6 %) and 377 (42.2 %) patients, which was associated with the presence of PCa (p < 0.001) and HGPCa (p < 0.001). Particularly in patients aged ≤55 years, the assignment of MRI Grade 0 was correlated with extremely low rate of PCa (1/27) and no HGPCa. The c-statistic of Model 1 and Model 2 for predicting PCa was 0.875 and 0.841 (Z = 4.2302, p < 0.001), whereas for predicting HGPCa was 0.872 and 0.850 (Z = 3.265, p = 0.001).

The control group included 80 patients who were referred to the urology outpatient clinic with normal rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The patients' characteristics, baseline PSA value, and serum endocan levels were recorded. The patients were followed up with the measurement of PSA concentration every 3 months during the first year, thereafter every 6 months until 5 years, then yearly after surgery.

Current inadequacies for stratifying patients with aggressive disease presents a strong rationale to systematically identify lncRNAs as clinical predictors in localized prostate cancer.  Objective:   To identify RNA biomarkers associated with aggressive prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Radical prostatectomy microarray and clinical data was obtained from 910 patients in three published institutional cohorts: Mayo Clinic I (N=545, median follow-up 13.8 yr), Mayo Clinic II (N=235, median follow-up 6.7 yr), and Thomas Jefferson University (N=130, median follow-up 9.6 yr).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary clinical endpoint was distant metastasis-free survival. Secondary endpoints include prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to evaluate the association of lncRNA expression and these endpoints.  Results and limitations:   An integrative analysis revealed Prostate Cancer Associated Transcript-14 (PCAT-14) as the most prevalent lncRNA that is aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer patients. Down-regulation of PCAT-14 expression significantly associated with Gleason score and a greater probability of metastatic progression, overall survival, and prostate cancer-specific mortality across multiple independent datasets and ethnicities. Low PCAT-14 expression was implicated with genes involved in biological processes promoting aggressive disease. In-vitro analysis confirmed that low PCAT-14 expression increased migration while overexpressing PCAT-14 reduced cellular growth, migration, and invasion.  Conclusions:   We discovered that androgen-regulated PCAT-14 is overexpressed in prostate cancer, suppresses invasive phenotypes, and lower expression is significantly prognostic for multiple clinical endpoints supporting its significance for predicting metastatic disease that could be used to improve patient management.  Patient summary:   We discovered that aberrant prostate cancer associated transcript-14 expression during prostate cancer progression is prevalent across cancer patients.

Constitutively active splice variants of androgen receptor (AR) have emerged as drivers for resistance to androgen deprivation therapy, including the next-generation androgen-AR axis inhibitors abiraterone and enzalutamide. In this study, we describe the characteristics of a novel castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) model, designated JDCaP-hr (hormone refractory).  Methods:   JDCaP-hr was established from an androgen-dependent JDCaP xenograft model after surgical castration. The expression of AR and its splice variants in JDCaP-hr was evaluated by immunoblotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effects of AR antagonists and testosterone on JDCaP-hr were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The roles of full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7 in JDCaP-hr cell growth were evaluated using RNA interference.  Results:   JDCaP-hr acquired a C-terminally truncated AR protein during progression from the parental JDCaP. The expression of AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA was upregulated by 10-fold in JDCaP-hr compared with that in JDCaP, indicating that the JDCaP and JDCaP-hr models simulate castration resistance with some clinical features, such as overexpression of AR and its splice variants. The AR antagonist bicalutamide did not affect JDCaP-hr xenograft growth, and importantly, testosterone induced tumor regression. In vitro analysis demonstrated that androgen-independent prostate-specific antigen secretion and cell proliferation of JDCaP-hr were predominantly mediated by AR-V7. JDCaP-hr cell growth displayed a bell-shaped dependence on testosterone, and it was suppressed by physiological concentrations of testosterone. Testosterone induced rapid downregulation of both AR-FL and AR-V7 expression at physiological concentrations and suppressed expression of the AR target gene KLK3.  Conclusions:   Our findings support the clinical value of testosterone therapy, including bipolar androgen therapy, in the treatment of AR-overexpressed CRPC driven by AR splice variants that are not clinically actionable at present.

Absent/weak AZGP1 expression and Gleason grade ≥4 at the margin are each independent predictors of BR in patients with PSMs. Our study aimed to determine whether the biomarkers AZGP1 expression and Gleason grade at the site of a PSM are significant independent markers of biochemical and clinical relapse (CR) when modeled together and whether one of these biomarkers may be superior in its capacity to predict outcome.  Methods:   A cohort of 275 consecutive patients with margin-positive localized PC following surgery were assessed for Gleason grade and AZGP1 expression at the PSM. BR-free survival was the primary end-point, while CR-free survival and PC-specific death were secondary endpoints. Kaplan-Meier Analysis and Cox Proportional Hazards Modeling were performed.  Results:   Absent AZGP1 expression was significantly associated with increased risk of BR (P = 0.001) and PC-specific death (P = 0.02). Gleason grade ≥4 at PSM was associated with BR (P = 0.02), CR (P = 0.003), and PC-specific death (P = 0.004). On multivariable analysis, absent AZGP1 expression remained an independent predictor of BR (HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.5-3.9, P < 0.001) when modeled with Gleason grade at margin (HR 1.3, 95%CI 0.9-1.9, P = 0.16), preoperative PSA (P = 0.002), seminal vesicle involvement (P = 0.002), extraprostatic extension (P = 0.001), Gleason score (P = 0.01), adjuvant treatment (P = 0.75), linear length of the involved margin (P = 0.001) and margin number (P = 0.09).  Conclusion:   Absent AZGP1 expression is an independent predictor of BR in margin-positive localized PC and is associated with increased PC-specific mortality in a Phase II study.

Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that free fatty acid 4 (FFA4), a GPCR activated by ω-3 fatty acids, inhibits responses to both LPA and EGF in these cells. One potential mechanism for the inhibition involves negative interactions between FFA4 and LPA1, thereby suppressing responses to EGF that require LPA1 In the current study, we examined the role of LPA1 in mediating EGF and FFA4 agonist responses in two human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. The results show that an LPA1-selective antagonist inhibits proliferation and migration to both LPA and EGF. Knockdown of LPA1 expression, using silencing RNA, blocks responses to LPA and significantly inhibits responses to EGF. The partial response to EGF that is observed after LPA1 knockdown is not inhibited by FFA4 agonists. Finally, the role of arrestin-3, a GPCR-binding protein that mediates many actions of activated GPCRs, was tested. Knockdown of arrestin-3 completely inhibits responses to both LPA and EGF in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that LPA1 plays a critical role in EGF responses and that FFA4 agonists inhibit proliferation by suppressing positive cross-talk between LPA1 and the EGF receptor.""","""['Mandi M Hopkins', 'Ze Liu', 'Kathryn E Meier']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Omega-3 fatty acids and other FFA4 agonists inhibit growth factor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Cross-talk between lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 and tropomyosin receptor kinase A promotes lung epithelial cell migration.', 'Lysophosphatidic acid inhibits Ca2+ signaling in response to epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation in human astrocytoma cells by a mechanism involving phospholipase C(gamma) and a G(alphai) protein.', 'GPR87 mediates lysophosphatidic acid-induced colony dispersal in A431 cells.', 'The autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor cascade: proposal of a novel potential therapeutic target for treating glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Free-fatty acid receptor-1 (FFA1/GPR40) promotes papillary RCC proliferation and tumor growth via Src/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB but suppresses migration by inhibition of EGFR, ERK1/2, STAT3 and EMT.', 'From outside to inside and back again: the lysophosphatidic acid-CCN axis in signal transduction.', 'Integration and Spatial Organization of Signaling by G Protein-Coupled Receptor Homo- and Heterodimers.', 'Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling in Cancer Cells: What Makes LPA So Special?', 'GPR120/FFAR4 Pharmacology: Focus on Agonists in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Drug Discovery.']"""

We aimed to compare these two approaches in terms of functional and oncological outcomes and report the early postoperative outcomes at 12 weeks.  Method:   In this randomised controlled phase 3 study, men who had newly diagnosed clinically localised prostate cancer and who had chosen surgery as their treatment approach, were able to read and speak English, had no previous history of head injury, dementia, or psychiatric illness or no other concurrent cancer, had an estimated life expectancy of 10 years or more, and were aged between 35 years and 70 years were eligible and recruited from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (Brisbane, QLD). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or radical retropubic prostatectomy. Randomisation was computer generated and occurred in blocks of ten. This was an open trial; however, study investigators involved in data analysis were masked to each patient's condition. Further, a masked central pathologist reviewed the biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Primary outcomes were urinary function (urinary domain of EPIC) and sexual function (sexual domain of EPIC and IIEF) at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 months and oncological outcome (positive surgical margin status and biochemical and imaging evidence of progression at 24 months). The trial was powered to assess health-related and domain-specific quality of life outcomes over 24 months. We report here the early outcomes at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The per-protocol populations were included in the primary and safety analyses. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), number ACTRN12611000661976.  Findings:   Between Aug 23, 2010, and Nov 25, 2014, 326 men were enrolled, of whom 163 were randomly assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and 163 to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. 18 withdrew (12 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and six assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy); thus, 151 in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group proceeded to surgery and 157 in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group. 121 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy completed the 12 week questionnaire versus 131 assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group at 6 weeks post-surgery (74·50 vs 71·10; p=0·09) or 12 weeks post-surgery (83·80 vs 82·50; p=0·48). Sexual function scores did not differ significantly between the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group at 6 weeks post-surgery (30·70 vs 32·70; p=0·45) or 12 weeks post-surgery (35·00 vs 38·90; p=0·18). Equivalence testing on the difference between the proportion of positive surgical margins between the two groups (15 [10%] in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group vs 23 [15%] in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group) showed that equality between the two techniques could not be established based on a 90% CI with a Δ of 10%. However, a superiority test showed that the two proportions were not significantly different (p=0·21). 14 patients (9%) in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group versus six (4%) in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group had postoperative complications (p=0·052). 12 (8%) men receiving radical retropubic prostatectomy and three (2%) men receiving robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy experienced intraoperative adverse events.  Interpretation:   These two techniques yield similar functional outcomes at 12 weeks. Longer term follow-up is needed. In the interim, we encourage patients to choose an experienced surgeon they trust and with whom they have rapport, rather than a specific surgical approach.

In this study, we investigated safety and overall survival in radium-223 treated patients in an early access programme done after the ALSYMPCA study and before regulatory approval of radium-223.  Methods:   We did an international, prospective, interventional, open-label, single-arm, phase 3b study. Enrolled patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed progressive bone-predominant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with two or more skeletal metastases on imaging (with no restriction as to whether they were symptomatic or asymptomatic; without visceral disease but lymph node metastases were allowed). Patients received intravenous injections of radium-223, 50 kBq/kg (current recommendation 55 kBq/kg after implementation of National Institute of Standards and Technology update on April 18, 2016) every 4 weeks for up to six injections. Other concomitant anticancer therapies were allowed. Primary endpoints were safety and overall survival. The safety and efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The study has been completed, and we report the final analysis here. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01618370, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2012-000075-16.  Findings:   Between July 22, 2012, and Dec 19, 2013, 839 patients were enrolled from 113 sites in 14 countries. 696 patients received one or more doses of radium-223; 403 (58%) of these patients had all six planned injections. Any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 523 (75%) of 696 patients; any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events deemed to be related to treatment were reported in 281 (40%) patients. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia in 32 (5%) patients, thrombocytopenia in 15 (2%) patients, neutropenia in ten (1%) patients, and leucopenia in nine (1%) patients. Any grade of serious adverse events were reported in 243 (35%) patients. Median follow-up was 7·5 months (IQR 5-11) and 210 deaths were reported; median overall survival was 16 months (95% CI 13-not available [NA]). In an exploratory analysis of overall survival with predefined factors, median overall survival was longer for: patients with baseline alkaline phosphatase concentration less than the upper limit of normal (ULN; median NA, 95% CI 16 months-NA) than for patients with an alkaline phosphatase concentration equal to or greater than the ULN (median 12 months, 11-15); patients with baseline haemoglobin levels 10 g/dL or greater (median 17 months, 14-NA) than for patients with haemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL (median 10 months, 8-14); patients with a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 (median NA, 17 months-NA) than for patients with an ECOG PS of 1 (median 13 months, 11-NA) or an ECOG PS of 2 or more (median 7 months, 5-11); and for patients with no reported baseline pain (median NA, 16 months-NA) than for those with mild pain (median 14 months, 13-NA) or moderate-severe pain (median 11 months, 9-13). Median overall survival was also longer in patients who received radium-223 plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or both (median NA, 95% CI 16 months-NA) than in those who did not receive these agents (median 13 months, 12-16), and in patients who received radium-223 plus denosumab (median NA, 15 months-NA) than in patients who received radium-223 without denosumab (median 13 months, 12-NA).  Interpretation:   Our findings show that radium-223 can be safely combined with abiraterone or enzalutamide, which are now both part of the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, our findings extend to patients who were asymptomatic at baseline, unlike those enrolled in the pivotal ALSYMPCA study. The findings of prolonged survival in patients treated with concomitant abiraterone, enzalutamide, or denosumab require confirmation in prospective randomised trials.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of body mass index in predicting adverse clinical outcomes which require adjuvant RT among men with organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   We used a prospective cohort of 1,170 low-intermediate PCa risk men who underwent radical prostatectomy and evaluated the effect of body mass index on adverse pathologic features and freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF). Clinical and pathologic variables were compared across the body mass index groups using an analysis of variance model for continuous variables or χ(2) for categorical variables. Factors related to adverse pathologic features were examined using logistic regression models. Time to biochemical recurrence was compared across the groups using a log-rank survivorship analysis. Multivariable analysis predicting biochemical recurrence was conducted with a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Patients with elevated body mass index (defined as body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)) had greater extraprostatic extension (p = 0.004), and positive surgical margins (p = 0.01). Elevated body mass index did not correlate with preoperative risk groupings (p = 0.94). However, when compared with non-obese patients (body mass index <30 kg/m(2)), obese patients (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)) were much more likely to have higher rate of adverse pathologic features (p = 0.006). In patients with low- and intermediate- risk disease, obesity was strongly associated with rate of pathologic upgrading of tumors (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02), respectively. After controlling for known preoperative risk factors, body mass index was independently associated with ≥2 adverse pathologic features (p = 0.002), an indicator for adjuvant RT as well as FFbF (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   Body mass index of ≥30 kg/m(2) is independently associated with adverse pathologic features, which is an indicator for additional RT, particularly in patients with low-intermediate risk disease. Future studies may determine if this select group of patients may be best treated with definitive RT to reduce toxicity from additional RT following radical prostatectomy.

AR mutations associated to prostate cancer (PCa) have been shown to result in receptor activation by non-androgenic substances and anti-androgenic drugs. Two AR mutations known to alter the function of anti-androgens are the ART877A mutation, which is frequently detected mutation in PCa tumors and the ARW741C that is rare and has been derived in vitro following exposure of cells to the anti-androgen bicalutamide. AR activation by non-androgenic environmental substances has been suggested to affect PCa progression. In the present study we investigated the effect of AR mutations (ARW741C and ART877A) on the transcriptional activation following exposure of cells to an androgenic brominated flame retardant, 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2 dibromoethyl) cyclohexane (TBECH, also named DBE-DBCH). The AR mutations resulted in higher interaction energies and increased transcriptional activation in response to TBECH diastereomer exposures. The ART877A mutation rendered AR highly responsive to low levels of DHT and TBECH and led to increased AR nuclear translocation. Gene expression analysis showed a stronger induction of AR target genes in LNCaP cells (ART877A) compared to T-47D cells (ARWT) following TBECH exposure. Furthermore, AR knockdown experiments confirmed the AR dependency of these responses. The higher sensitivity of ART877A and ARW741C to low levels of TBECH suggests that cells with these AR mutations are more susceptible to androgenic endocrine disrupters.""","""['Joubert Banjop Kharlyngdoh', 'Solomon Asnake', 'Ajay Pradhan', 'Per-Erik Olsson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Diastereomers of the brominated flame retardant 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2 dibromoethyl)cyclohexane induce androgen receptor activation in the hepg2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and the lncap prostate cancer cell line.', 'The Effects of the Organic Flame-Retardant 1,2-Dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl) Cyclohexane (TBECH) on Androgen Signaling in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The brominated flame retardants TBECH and DPTE alter prostate growth, histology and gene expression patterns in the mouse.', 'A review of 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane in the environment and assessment of its persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor modulation following combination exposure to brominated flame-retardants.']"""

In this study, the outcome of therapies and prognostic factors affecting surgical outcomes for patients with PCa spinal metastases are discussed to select the best candidates for aggressive surgical resection.  Methods:   All patients affected by the spinal metastatic PCa surgically treated at our spine tumor center were reviewed. Overall survival was analyzed from the time of spinal surgery. A univariate survival analysis and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis to identify independent prognostic factors were carried out. The survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were analyzed by the log-rank test. Factors with P values of 0.1 or less were subjected to multivariate analysis for survival rate by multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis.  Results:   A total of 31 consecutive patients were identified. Of these, 29 underwent surgical resection. The median survival time of all patients after their spinal surgery was 44.0 months. Visceral metastases, revised Tokuhashi scores (0-8/9-11/12-15), Tomita scores (7-10/2-6), hormone status, and bisphosphonate treatment were suggested as the potential prognostic factors through univariate analysis.

Here, we describe the development of novel aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for drug delivery, with an eye towards ablation of cancer cells. The aminoglycoside paromomycin was first cross-linked with resorcinol diglycidyl ether leading to the formation of a poly (amino ether), PAE. PAE molecules were further derivatized with methoxy-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG resulting in the formation of mPEG-PAE polymer, which self-assembled to form nanoparticles. Formation of the mPEG-PAE amphiphile was characterized using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and FTIR spectroscopy. Self-assembly of the polymer into nanoparticles was characterized using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analyses, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the pyrene fluorescence assay. mPEG-PAE nanoparticles were able to carry significant amounts of doxorubicin (DOX), presumably by means of hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the core. Cell-based studies indicated that mPEG-PAE nanoparticles, loaded with doxorubicin, were able to induce significant loss in viabilities of PC3 human prostate cancer, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer, and MB49 murine bladder cancer cells; empty nanoparticles resulted in negligible losses of cell viability under the conditions investigated. Taken together, our results indicate that the mPEG-PAE nanoparticle platform is attractive for drug delivery in different applications, including cancer.""","""['Bhavani Miryala', 'Sudhakar Godeshala', 'Taraka Sai Pavan Grandhi', 'Matthew D Christensen', 'Yanqing Tian', 'Kaushal Rege']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces""","""['Folate-conjugated amphiphilic hyperbranched block copolymers based on Boltorn H40, poly(L-lactide) and poly(ethylene glycol) for tumor-targeted drug delivery.', 'Enzyme and Thermal Dual Responsive Amphiphilic Polymer Core-Shell Nanoparticle for Doxorubicin Delivery to Cancer Cells.', 'Co-delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs by micelles: a new approach using drug conjugated PEG-PCLNanoparticles.', 'A comprehensive review on alginate-based delivery systems for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agent: Doxorubicin.', 'Nanoparticle delivery strategies to target doxorubicin to tumor cells and reduce side effects.', 'Encapsulation of Amikacin into Microparticles Based on Low-Molecular-Weight Poly(lactic acid) and Poly(lactic acid-co-polyethylene glycol).', 'Multifunctional Neomycin-Triazine-Based Cationic Lipids for Gene Delivery with Antibacterial Properties.', 'Amphiphilic Aminoglycosides as Medicinal Agents.', 'A library of aminoglycoside-derived lipopolymer nanoparticles for delivery of small molecules and nucleic acids.', 'Bioreducible Poly(Amino Ethers) Based mTOR siRNA Delivery for Lung Cancer.']"""

Further, we demonstrated that increasing the encoded antigen's MHC-binding affinity led to increased PD-1 expression on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Together these phenomena provided resistance to antitumor immunization that was abrogated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. We consequently sought to determine whether similar regulation occurred in human patients following antitumor immunization. Using clinical samples from prostate cancer patients who were previously immunized with a DNA vaccine, we analyzed changes in checkpoint receptor expression on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, the effect of PD-1 blockade on elicited immune responses, and for changes in checkpoint ligand expression on patients' circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We observed no significant changes in T-cell expression of PD-1 or other checkpoint receptors, but antigen-specific immune responses were detected and/or augmented with PD-1 blockade as detected by IFNγ and granzyme B secretion or trans vivo DTH testing. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was increased on CTCs following vaccination, and this PD-L1 upregulation was associated with the development of sustained T-cell immunity and longer progression-free survival. Finally, similar results were observed with patients treated with sipuleucel-T, another vaccine targeting the same prostate antigen. These findings provide in-human rationale for combining anticancer vaccines with PD-1 blocking antibodies, particularly for the treatment of prostate cancer, a disease for which vaccines have demonstrated benefit and yet PD-1 inhibitors have shown little clinical benefit to date as monotherapies.""","""['Brian T Rekoske', 'Brian M Olson', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['PD-1 or PD-L1 Blockade Restores Antitumor Efficacy Following SSX2 Epitope-Modified DNA Vaccine Immunization.', 'Vaccination with High-Affinity Epitopes Impairs Antitumor Efficacy by Increasing PD-1 Expression on CD8+ T Cells.', 'Combination of Sunitinib and PD-L1 Blockade Enhances Anticancer Efficacy of TLR7/8 Agonist-Based Nanovaccine.', 'The Next Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors: PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade in Melanoma.', 'Epigenetic strategies synergize with PD-L1/PD-1 targeted cancer immunotherapies to enhance antitumor responses.', 'Current status and progress of the development of prostate cancer vaccines.', 'An Immunological Perspective of Circulating Tumor Cells as Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

When combined with pathway analysis, profiling approaches are able to identify molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer, group patients by cancer subtype, and predict prognosis. This strategy can also be implemented to study prostate cancer in very specific populations, such as African Americans who have higher rates of prostate cancer incidence and mortality than other racial groups in the United States. In this study, age-, stage-, and Gleason score-matched prostate tumor specimen from African American and Caucasian American men, along with non-malignant adjacent prostate tissue from these same patients, were compared. Protein expression changes and altered pathway associations were identified in prostate cancer generally and in African American prostate cancer specifically. In comparing tumor to non-malignant samples, 45 proteins were significantly cancer-associated and 3 proteins were significantly downregulated in tumor samples. Notably, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (FABP5) were upregulated in human prostate cancer tissues, consistent with their known functions in prostate cancer progression. Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3 (ALDH1A3) was also upregulated in tumor samples. The Metastasis Associated Protein 3 (MTA3) pathway was significantly enriched in tumor samples compared to non-malignant samples. While the current experiment was unable to detect statistically significant differences in protein expression between African American and Caucasian American samples, differences in overrepresentation and pathway enrichment were found. Structural components (Cytoskeletal Proteins and Extracellular Matrix Protein protein classes, and Biological Adhesion Gene Ontology (GO) annotation) were overrepresented in African American but not Caucasian American tumors. Additionally, 5 pathways were enriched in African American prostate tumors: the Small Cell Lung Cancer, Platelet-Amyloid Precursor Protein, Agrin, Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction, and Intrinsic pathways.

However, its roles in prostate cancer (PCa) are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of SLC39A14 in patients with PCa and its functions in malignant phenotypes of PCa cells.  Patients and methods:   Subcellular localization and expression pattern of SLC39A14 protein were examined by immunohistochemistry. Then, the associations of SLC39A14 expression with various clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of patients with PCa were statistically evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of SLC39A14 overexpression and knockdown on PCa cell proliferation and motility were, respectively, examined by Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell, and wound-healing assays.  Results:   The immunoreactive scores of SLC39A14 protein in human PCa tissues were significantly lower than those in normal prostate tissues. Based on the Taylor dataset, SLC39A14 downregulation occurred more frequently in patients with PCa with a higher Gleason score (P<0.001), advanced clinical stage (P=0.008), presence of metastasis (P=0.009), and prostate-specific antigen failure (P=0.006). More interestingly, the survival analysis identified SLC39A14 as an independent factor for predicting the biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients with PCa (P=0.017). Functionally, the enforced expression of SLC39A14 could suppress cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa cell lines in vitro, which could be reversed by the knockdown of SLC39A14.  Conclusion:   Decreased expression of SLC39A14 may lead to malignant phenotypes of PCa cells and aggressive tumor progression in patients with PCa. Importantly, SLC39A14 may function as a tumor suppressor and a biomarker for screening patients with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy.""","""['Xiao-Ming Xu', 'Cheng-Gong Wang', 'Yu-Di Zhu', 'Wei-Hua Chen', 'Si-Liang Shao', 'Fu-Neng Jiang', 'Qian-De Liao']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['High expression of Rab25 contributes to malignant phenotypes and biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'HMGCS2 functions as a tumor suppressor and has a prognostic impact in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of SLC6A1 associates with drug resistance and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'ARRDC3 Inhibits the Progression of Human Prostate Cancer Through ARRDC3-ITGβ4 Pathway.', 'Decreased expression of TCF12 contributes to progression and predicts biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Chromosomal assembly of the flat oyster (Ostrea edulis L.) genome as a new genetic resource for aquaculture.', 'Nuclear size rectification: A potential new therapeutic approach to reduce metastasis in cancer.', 'Single-cell transcriptomics uncover the key ferroptosis regulators contribute to cancer progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Role of the Metabolism of Zinc and Manganese Ions in Human Cancerogenesis.', 'Evaluation of the prognostic values of solute carrier (SLC) family 39 genes for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

However, we recently identified one patient showing a response from abiraterone despite expression of AR-V7 in his circulating tumour cells (CTC). Therefore, we precisely assessed the response in a cohort of 21 AR-V7 positive castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who had received therapy with abiraterone or enzalutamide. We detected a subgroup of six AR-V7 positive patients showing benefit from either abiraterone or enzalutamide. Their progression free survival was 26 d (censored) to 188 d. Four patients displayed a prostate-specific antigen decrease of >50%. When analysing prior therapies, we noticed that only one of the six patients had received next-generation ADT prior to CTC collection. As a result, we conclude that AR-V7 status in CTC cannot entirely predict nonresponse to next generation ADT and AR-V7-positive patients should not be systematically denied abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment, especially as effective alternative treatment options are still limited.

This study investigates the quality of treatment plans and the accuracy of in vivo portal dosimetry in such a hybrid approach for the case of prostate radiotherapy.  Material and methods:   Conformal and limited-modulation VMAT plans were produced, together with five hybrid IMRT/VMAT plans, in which 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the segments were sequenced for IMRT, while the remainder were sequenced for VMAT. Integrated portal images were predicted for the plans. The plans were then delivered as a single hybrid beam using an Elekta Synergy accelerator with Agility head to a water-equivalent phantom and treatment time, isocentric dose and portal images were measured.  Results:   Increasing the IMRT percentage improves dose uniformity to the planning target volume (p<0.01 for 50% IMRT or more), substantially reduces the volume of rectum irradiated to 65Gy (p=0.02 for 25% IMRT) and increases the monitor units (p<0.001). Delivery time also increases substantially. All plans show accurate delivery of dose and reliable prediction of portal images.  Conclusions:   Hybrid IMRT/VMAT can be efficiently planned and delivered as a single beam sequence. Beyond 25% IMRT, the delivery time becomes unacceptably long, with increased risk of intrafraction motion, but 25% IMRT is an attractive compromise.

We determined the extent to which objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior were independently associated with quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   An exploratory cross-sectional analysis was undertaken on baseline data from a multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a clinician referral and 12-week exercise program for men who had completed active treatment for prostate cancer. Multiple regression analyses were performed using data from 98 prostate cancer survivors who wore hip-mounted accelerometers (time spent sedentary defined as <100 counts per minute [CPM]; MVPA defined as >1,951 CPM) and completed self-report instruments on their quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results were compared with minimal clinically important differences for the quality of life scales.  Results:   Independent of sedentary behavior, increases in MVPA of between 15 and 33 min/day were associated with clinically important (but not statistically significant) improvements in three quality of life scales (insomnia, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Independent of MVPA, decreases in sedentary behavior of 119 and 107 min/day were associated with clinically important (but not statistically significant) improvements in physical functioning and role functioning, respectively.  Conclusion:   Within our exploratory study, modest increases in MVPA and more substantive decreases in sedentary behavior were independently associated with clinically important improvements in several quality of life scales.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate intra-patient DIR for two highly deformable organs-the bladder and the rectum-in prostate cancer RT using a quantitative metric based on multiple image registration, the distance discordance metric (DDM). Voxel-by-voxel DIR uncertainties of the bladder and rectum were evaluated using DDM on weekly CT scans of 38 subjects previously treated with RT for prostate cancer (six scans/subject). The DDM was obtained from group-wise B-spline registration of each patient's collection of repeat CT scans. For each structure, registration uncertainties were derived from DDM-related metrics. In addition, five other quantitative measures, including inverse consistency error (ICE), transitivity error (TE), Dice similarity (DSC) and volume ratios between corresponding structures from pre- and post- registered images were computed and compared with the DDM. The DDM varied across subjects and structures; DDMmean of the bladder ranged from 2 to 13 mm and from 1 to 11 mm for the rectum. There was a high correlation between DDMmean of the bladder and the rectum (Pearson's correlation coefficient, R p = 0.62). The correlation between DDMmean and the volume ratios post-DIR was stronger (R p = 0.51; 0.68) than the correlation with the TE (bladder: R p = 0.46; rectum: R p = 0.47), or the ICE (bladder: R p = 0.34; rectum: R p = 0.37). There was a negative correlation between DSC and DDMmean of both the bladder (R p = -0.23) and the rectum (R p = -0.63). The DDM uncertainty metric indicated considerable DIR variability across subjects and structures. Our results show a stronger correlation with volume ratios and with the DSC using DDM compared to using ICE and TE. The DDM has the potential to quantitatively identify regions of large DIR uncertainties and consequently identify anatomical/scan outliers. The DDM can, thus, be applied to improve the adaptive RT process for tumor sites subject to motion.""","""['Ziad Saleh', 'Maria Thor', 'Aditya P Apte', 'Gregory Sharp', 'Xiaoli Tang', 'Harini Veeraraghavan', 'Ludvig Muren', 'Joseph Deasy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['The distance discordance metric-a novel approach to quantifying spatial uncertainties in intra- and inter-patient deformable image registration.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Roles of Deformable Image Registration in adaptive RT: From contour propagation to dose monitoring.']"""

Currently, the screening for early detection of PCa is based on determination of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. But this biomarker presents some disadvantages related to its specificity and sensitivity. In our study, we want to determine if methylation levels of the glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) gene could be used as a new biomarker for the early detection of PCa and to distinguish between malignant and benign pros-tatic lesions.  Methods:   To determine the methylation levels of the GSTP1 gene, 31 men with histopathological diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma and 34 men with the histopathological diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as controls were included in the study group. The genomic DNA was extracted from urine samples. We analyzed the methylation levels of the GSTP1 gene by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) method.  Results:   In prostate cancer patients 27 of 31 (87%) presented hypermethylated levels of the GSTP1 gene, whereas 4 of 34 (11.8%) BPH patients had hypermethylated levels of the GSTP1 gene. Further, in the case of these four patients a second biopsy was done, which confirmed the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. Using the receiver operating curve (ROC), we obtained a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 98% for the GSTP1 gene.

The goal of this study was to investigate prostate cancer risk in outdoor workers, a population with high sun exposure.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cases and controls from a large study (conducted between 1994 and 1997) were used for this analysis. A job exposure matrix (JEM) was used to assign solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) at work as moderate (2 to <6 hours outside/day) or high (≥6 hours). Average daily satellite UV-B measures were linked to the latitude/longitude of the residences of each participant. Several other exposure metrics were also examined, including ever/never exposed and standard erythemal dose by years (SED×years). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between solar UVR exposure and the odds of prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 1638 cases and 1697 controls were included.

Patients with CRPC usually succumb to death in less than 5 years and there is no cure. Here, we investigated reasons for ADT failure.  Materials and methods:   Biopsy specimens from untreated and diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated patients were assessed for localization of antibody IgGs against androgen (AR) and estrogen (ER) receptors.  Results:   In untreated and DES-treated sections, methylene blue stained basic proteins in dark basal (undifferentiated) PCa cells, whereas light basal cells were not stained. AR localized to light basal cells which showed widespread degeneration in sections from DES-treated patients, indicating their dependence on androgen. In contrast, dark basal cells did not show widespread degeneration in DES-treated patients; ER was usually localized in dark cells. The number of dark cells progressively increased in DES-treated patients indicating their androgen-independence. The localization of AR and ER in some light and dark basal cells indicated that the supply of androgen/estrogen was not inhibited during ADT. Dark basal cells had emerged prior to treatment and proliferated during DES treatment, that also indicated their androgen-independence.  Conclusion:   PCa has at least two populations of cells: androgen-dependent light basal and estrogen-dependent dark basal cells. ADT did not destroy estrogen-dependent cells which may have given rise to CRPC tumors. Therefore, ADT is an incomplete treatment.

The framework has three main functions: MARGE-potential, MARGE-express, and MARGE-cistrome. MARGE-potential defines a regulatory potential (RP) for each gene as the sum of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals weighted by a function of genomic distance from the transcription start site. The MARGE framework includes a compendium of RPs derived from 365 human and 267 mouse H3K27ac ChIP-seq data sets. Relative RPs, scaled using this compendium, are superior to superenhancers in predicting BET (bromodomain and extraterminal domain) -inhibitor repressed genes. MARGE-express, which uses logistic regression to retrieve relevant H3K27ac profiles from the compendium to accurately model a query set of differentially expressed genes, was tested on 671 diverse gene sets from MSigDB. MARGE-cistrome adopts a novel semisupervised learning approach to identify cis-regulatory elements regulating a gene set. MARGE-cistrome exploits information from H3K27ac signal at DNase I hypersensitive sites identified from published human and mouse DNase-seq data. We tested the framework on newly generated RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq profiles upon siRNA silencing of multiple transcriptional and epigenetic regulators in a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP-abl.

ASC-derived conditioned medium (CM) significantly inhibited PC3M-luc2 cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, but the effect was canceled by miR-145 knockdown in ASCs. ASC miR-145 knockdown CM also reduced the expression of Caspase 3/7 with increased antiapoptotic protein, BclxL, expression in PC3M-luc2 cells. This study provides preclinical data that ASCs inhibit PCa growth, inducing PCa cell apoptosis with reduced activity of BclxL, at least in part, by miR-145, including exosomes released from ASCs, suggesting that ASC administration could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PCa.""","""['Kiyoshi Takahara', 'Masaaki Ii', 'Teruo Inamoto', 'Takatoshi Nakagawa', 'Naokazu Ibuki', 'Yuki Yoshikawa', 'Takuya Tsujino', 'Taizo Uchimoto', 'Kenkichi Saito', 'Tomoaki Takai', 'Naoki Tanda', 'Koichiro Minami', 'Hirofumi Uehara', 'Kazumasa Komura', 'Hajime Hirano', 'Hayahito Nomi', 'Satoshi Kiyama', 'Michio Asahi', 'Haruhito Azuma']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Stem Cells Dev""","""['Adipose-derived stromal cells inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation inducing apoptosis.', 'Differential Response of Non-cancerous and Malignant Breast Cancer Cells to Conditioned Medium of Adipose tissue-derived Stromal Cells (ASCs).', 'Exosomes from bulk and stem cells from human prostate cancer have a differential microRNA content that contributes cooperatively over local and pre-metastatic niche.', 'Regulatory role of microRNAs in the proliferation and differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells.', 'The Crosstalk Between Adipose-Derived Stem or Stromal Cells (ASC) and Cancer Cells and ASC-Mediated Effects on Cancer Formation and Progression-ASCs: Safety Hazard or Harmless Source of Tropism?', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Roles of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal-Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer Therapy.', 'Characterization and Comparison of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosome Isolation Methods using Culture Supernatant.', 'Cell-Free Therapies: The Use of Cell Extracts to Mitigate Irradiation-Injured Salivary Glands.', 'The emerging role of exosomes in innate immunity, diagnosis and therapy.']"""

Overall, 50 (37%) patients worsened by at least one IIEF-EF category. Conversel, 23 (17%) patients reported an improvement in postoperative IIEF-EF score; 75 (55.6%) and 10 (7.4%) patients maintained and eventually improved their IIEF-EF category, respectively. Patients reporting a decrease in the postoperative IIEF-EF score were significantly older (P=0.03) and showed a significantly longer mean FU (P<0.01) than those reporting postoperative improvements of IIEF-EF. Nine (6.7%) patients showed significant EF improvement according to MCIDs criteria. Both higher IPSS scores (odds ratio (OR): 1.12; P=0.02) and lower IIEF-EF (OR: 0.88; P<0.01) at baseline, emerged as independent predictors of postoperative EF improvement. HoLEP was associated with a decrease in EF and a persistent amelioration of BPH-related urinary symptoms at long-term FU. Almost one third of patients worsened by at least one IIEF-EF category. However, a clinically meaningful EF improvement was observed in roughly 7% of the individuals.

The detection of circulating tumor cells could potentially improve the management of patients with disseminated cancer, including diagnosis, treatment strategies, and surveillance. Currently, CellSearch(®) is the most widely used and the only Food and Drug Administration-cleared system for circulating tumor cells detection in patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. In most cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, only low counts of circulating tumor cells have been reported.  Case presentation:   A 56-year-old white male with no particular medical history, was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity. According to the imaging results (computed tomography and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography) and panendoscopy, the TNM staging was classified as T4N2M0. A non-interruptive pelvimandibulectomy was conducted according to the multidisciplinary meeting advices and the postoperative observations were normal. The patient complained of a painful cervical edema and a trismus 6 weeks after the surgery. A relapse was found by computed tomography and the patient died two weeks later. The search for circulating tumor cells in peripheral venous blood by using the CellSearch(®) system revealed a very high count compared with published reports at three time points (pre-operative: 400; intra-operative: 150 and post-operative day 7: 1400 circulating tumor cells). Of note, all detected circulating tumor cells were epidermal growth factor receptor negative.  Conclusion:   We report here for the first time a rare case of oral squamous cell carcinoma with extremely high circulating tumor cells counts using the CellSearch(®) system. The absolute number of circulating tumor cells might predict a particular phase of cancer development as well as a poor survival, potentially contributing to a personalized healthcare.""","""['Xianglei Wu', 'Romina Mastronicola', 'Qian Tu', 'Gilbert Charles Faure', 'Marcelo De Carvalho Bittencourt', 'Gilles Dolivet']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['18F-FDG PET/CT in Oral Cuniculatum Carcinoma.', 'Positron emission tomography in the evaluation of the negative neck in patients with oral cavity cancer.', 'Post-operative PET/CT improves the detection of early recurrence of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity.', 'Circulating tumour cells in metastatic head and neck cancers.', 'Enrichment and detection of circulating tumor cells and its application in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Salivary Biomarkers for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis and Follow-Up: Current Status and Perspectives.', 'Circulating Tumour Cells (CTC), Head and Neck Cancer and Radiotherapy; Future Perspectives.', 'Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging Elucidates the Complex Relationship Between Glucose Uptake and Tissue Blood Flow Mechanism in Squamous Cell Oral Cancer Patients.', 'The use of rapid and cost-effective blood-based biomarkers in combination with tumour TNM stage for individual head and neck cancer patient treatment selection.']"""

Network meta-analysis is becoming more widely used as a means to compare multiple treatments in the same analysis. However, a network meta-analysis may exhibit inconsistency, whereby the treatment effect estimates do not agree across all trial designs, even after taking between-study heterogeneity into account. We propose two new estimation methods for network meta-analysis models with random inconsistency effects.  Methods:   The model we consider is an extension of the conventional random-effects model for meta-analysis to the network meta-analysis setting and allows for potential inconsistency using random inconsistency effects. Our first new estimation method uses a Bayesian framework with empirically-based prior distributions for both the heterogeneity and the inconsistency variances. We fit the model using importance sampling and thereby avoid some of the difficulties that might be associated with using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, we confirm the accuracy of our importance sampling method by comparing the results to those obtained using MCMC as the gold standard. The second new estimation method we describe uses a likelihood-based approach, implemented in the metafor package, which can be used to obtain (restricted) maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters and profile likelihood confidence intervals of the variance components.  Results:   We illustrate the application of the methods using two contrasting examples. The first uses all-cause mortality as an outcome, and shows little evidence of between-study heterogeneity or inconsistency. The second uses ""ear discharge"" as an outcome, and exhibits substantial between-study heterogeneity and inconsistency. Both new estimation methods give results similar to those obtained using MCMC.  Conclusions:   The extent of heterogeneity and inconsistency should be assessed and reported in any network meta-analysis. Our two new methods can be used to fit models for network meta-analysis with random inconsistency effects. They are easily implemented using the accompanying R code in the Additional file 1. Using these estimation methods, the extent of inconsistency can be assessed and reported.""","""['Martin Law', 'Dan Jackson', 'Rebecca Turner', 'Kirsty Rhodes', 'Wolfgang Viechtbauer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['A design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis and meta-regression with integrated nested Laplace approximations.', 'Implementing informative priors for heterogeneity in meta-analysis using meta-regression and pseudo data.', 'Paule-Mandel estimators for network meta-analysis with random inconsistency effects.', 'Bayesian hypothesis testing and estimation under the marginalized random-effects meta-analysis model.', 'Causal inference and adjustment for reference-arm risk in indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis.', 'A cumulative Bayesian network meta-analysis on the comparative efficacy of pharmacotherapies for mania over the last 40\xa0years.', 'Changes in glycaemic control of oral anti-diabetic medications assessed by continuous glucose monitors among patients with type 2 diabetes: a protocol of network meta-analysis.', 'Concepts and emerging issues of network meta-analysis.', 'Role of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in coronary atherosclerosis regression: a meta-analysis and meta-regression.', 'A simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for network meta-analysis and corresponding methods to evaluate the consistency assumption.']"""

These clinical factors are not accurate enough to predict individual risk of local failure of prostate cancer after radiotherapy. Parameters involved with radiosensitivity are required to improve the predictive capability for local relapse.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed 58 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate between August 2007 and October 2010 treated with 76 Gy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as a discovery cohort and 42 patients between March 2001 and May 2007 treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) as a validation cohort. Immunohistochemical examination for proteins involved in nonhomologous end-joining was performed using biopsy specimens.  Results:   Ku70 expression was not correlated with various clinical parameters, such as the Gleason score and D'amico risk classification, indicating that Ku70 expression was an independent prognostic factor. The predictive value for PSA relapse was markedly improved after the combination of Gleason score and Ku70 expression, as compared with Gleason score alone. In patients treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), no relapses were observed in patients with Gleason score ≤7 or low Ku70 expression. In contrast, patients with Gleason score ≥8 and high Ku70 expression had high PSA relapse rates. In the validation cohort, similar results were obtained.

The Wald-test was used to evaluate the prognostic importance of pathological fracture, primary site, Karnofsky performance status, localization of metastases, number of metastases, and cerebral metastases.  Results:   Median follow-up was 10 months (range 2-35). Bone survival showed no significant difference between groups (p = .303).

Improved techniques enabling the genome-wide analysis of FFPE material would be of great value, both from a research and clinical perspective.Comparing a single-strand DNA library preparation method originally developed for ancient DNA to conventional protocols using double-stranded DNA derived from FFPE material we obtain on average 900-fold more library molecules and improved sequence complexity from as little as 5 ng input DNA. FFPE DNA is highly fragmented, usually below 100bp, and up to 60% of reads start after or end prior to adenine residues, suggesting that crosslinks predominate at adenine residues. Similar to ancient DNA, C > T substitutions are slightly increased with maximum rates up to 3% at the ends of molecules. In whole exome sequencing of single-strand libraries from lung, breast, colorectal, prostate and skin cancers we identify known cancer mutations. In summary, we show that single-strand library preparation enables genomic sequencing, even from low amounts of degraded FFPE DNA. This method provides a clear advantage both in research and clinical settings, where FFPE material (e.g. from biopsies) often is the only source of DNA available.

In this study, we identified the epigenetic modulators that mediate the apoptotic effect of delphinidin in human prostate cancer cells. We found that treatment of LNCaP cells (a p53 wild-type, human prostate cancer cell line) with delphinidin increased caspase-3, -7, and -8 activity, whereas it decreased histone deacetylase activity. Among class I HDACs, the activity of HDAC3 was specifically inhibited by delphinidin. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by delphinidin was dependent on caspase-mediated cleavage of HDAC3, which results in the acetylation and stabilization of p53. We also observed that delphinidin potently upregulated pro-apoptotic genes that are positively regulated by p53, and downregulated various anti-apoptotic genes.

Recent data suggest that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is functionally linked to the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint. We evaluated the prognostic value of aberrant CXCL12 DNA methylation with respect to PD-L1 expression in primary PCa.  Results:   CXCL12 methylation showed a consistent significant correlation with Gleason grading groups in both cohorts (p < 0.001 for training and p = 0.034 for testing cohort). Short BCR-free survival was significantly associated with aberrant CXCL12 methylation in both cohorts and served as an independent prognostic factor in the testing cohort (hazard ratio = 1.92 [95%CI: 1.12-3.27], p = 0.049). Concomitant aberrant CXCL12 methylation and high PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with shorter BCR-free survival (p = 0.005).

Thus, this method is an attractive way to slow down the metabolic rate and modulate pharmacokinetics.  Purpose:   Enzalutamide (ENT) acts as a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor and has been approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. To attenuate the N-demethylation pathway, hydrogen atoms of the N-CH3 moiety were replaced by the relatively stable isotope deuterium, which showed similar pharmacological activities but exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties.  Methods:   We estimated in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters for ENT and its deuterated analog (d3-ENT). For in vitro studies, intrinsic primary isotope effects (K H/K D) were determined by the ratio of intrinsic clearance (CLint) obtained for ENT and d3-ENT. The CLint values were obtained by the substrate depletion method. For in vivo studies, ENT and d3-ENT were orally given to male Sprague Dawley rats separately and simultaneously to assess the disposition and metabolism of them. We also investigated the main metabolic pathway of ENT by comparing the rate of oxidation and hydrolysis in vitro.  Results:   The in vitro CLint (maximum velocity/Michaelis constant [V max/K m]) of d3-ENT in rat and human liver microsomes were 49.7% and 72.9% lower than those of the non-deuterated compound, corresponding to the K H/K D value of ~2. The maximum observed plasma concentration, C max, and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the last measurable sampling time point (AUC0-t) were 35% and 102% higher than those of ENT when orally administered to rats (10 mg/kg). The exposure of the N-demethyl metabolite M2 was eightfold lower, whereas that of the amide hydrolysis metabolite M1 and other minor metabolites was unchanged. The observed hydrolysis rate of M2 was at least ten times higher than that of ENT and d3-ENT in rat plasma.  Conclusion:   ENT was mainly metabolized through the ""parent→M2→M1"" pathway based on in vitro and in vivo elimination behavior. The observed in vitro deuterium isotope effect translated into increased exposure of the deuterated analog in rats. Once the carbon-hydrogen was replaced with carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds, the major metabolic pathway was retarded because of the relatively stable C-D bonds. The systemic exposure to d3-ENT can increase in humans, so the dose requirements can be reduced appropriately.""","""['Jinfang Jiang', 'Xuehai Pang', 'Liang Li', 'Xiaojian Dai', 'Xingxing Diao', 'Xiaoyan Chen', 'Dafang Zhong', 'Yingwei Wang', 'Yuanwei Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Application of a deuterium replacement strategy to modulate the pharmacokinetics of 7-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-3-(4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl)-2,6-dimethylpyrazolo5,1-boxazole, a novel CRF1 antagonist.', 'Effect of N-methyl deuteration on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enzalutamide.', 'Altering Metabolic Profiles of Drugs by Precision Deuteration 2: Discovery of a Deuterated Analog of Ivacaftor with Differentiated Pharmacokinetics for Clinical Development.', 'Deuterium isotope effect on the metabolism of N-nitrosodimethylamine and related compounds by cytochrome P4502E1.', 'The use of isotope effects to determine enzyme mechanisms.', 'Effect of deuteration on the single dose pharmacokinetic properties and postoperative analgesic activity of methadone.', 'Phase I clinical trial of HC-1119 soft capsule in Chinese healthy adult male subjects: Pharmacokinetics and safety of single-dose proportionality and effects of food.', 'Deuteration enhances the anti-tumor effects and relative anti-inflammatory effects via affecting proliferation and apoptosis.']"""

In prostate cancer, ID4 is epigenetically silenced and acts as a tumor suppressor. In normal prostate epithelial cells, ID4 collaborates with androgen receptor (AR) and p53 to exert its tumor suppressor activity. Previous studies have shown that ID4 promotes tumor suppressive function of AR whereas loss of ID4 results in tumor promoter activity of AR. Previous study from our lab showed that ectopic ID4 expression in DU145 attenuates proliferation and promotes AR expression suggesting that ID4 dependent AR activity is tumor suppressive. In this study, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of ID4 on highly malignant prostate cancer cell, PC3. Here we show that stable overexpression of ID4 in PC3 cells leads to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation and migration. In addition, in vivo studies showed a decrease in tumor size and volume of ID4 overexpressing PC3 cells, in nude mice. At the molecular level, these changes were associated with increased androgen receptor (AR), p21, and AR dependent FKBP51 expression.

It remains unclear whether salvage radiotherapy confers equivalent outcomes. Practice guidelines recommend referral to radiation oncology within 6 months after prostatectomy to discuss adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy. The study objectives were to assess, at a population level: (i) post-prostatectomy referral patterns for radiotherapy; (ii) adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy utilisation; and (iii) time trends in relation to clinical trials and guidelines. These findings provide indications of access to quality care.  Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study. Electronic radiotherapy consultation and treatment records were linked to the population-based Ontario Cancer Registry. The population included prostate cancer cases treated with prostatectomy in Ontario between 2003 and 2012. Radiotherapy referral and treatment rates over time were analysed using the chi-squared trend test.  Results:   Over the study period, 30 447 prostate cancer patients received prostatectomy. The proportion seen by radiation oncology within 6 months after prostatectomy doubled from 10.7% in 2003-2004 to 21.7% in 2011-2012 (P < 0.0001 for trend), with the largest annual percentage difference in 2009-2011 (3.4%). Among 4641 patients seen within 6 months, adjuvant radiotherapy rates remained at 51.0% ± 3.0%. Contemporaneous with radiation oncology referral trends, overall adjuvant radiotherapy use increased from 6.2% in 2003-2004 to 11.0% in 2011-2012 (P < 0.001), while salvage radiotherapy remained at 8.4% ± 0.4%. Consequently, the total proportion receiving radiotherapy within 24 months increased from 14.1% in 2003-2004 to 17.7% in 2009-2010 (P < 0.0001).

In vitro growth analysis showed that CXCR3A acted as a positive mediator in regulating cell growth, whereas CXCR3B exerted the opposite effect. In vitro invasion and migration assays showed that CXCL10 promoted gastric cancer cell invasion and migration via CXCR3A, but not CXCR3B.

Methods:   A total of 69 patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were enrolled. Thirty-four patients were treated with SBRT (36.25 Gy in five fractions) using Cyberknife and 35 patients treated with CF-EBRT (70.2-75.6 Gy in 39-42 fractions). PSA nadir, rate of PSA decline and biochemical failure (BCF) free survival were calculated and compared.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 53.6 months (range, 14-74), the median slopes for SBRT were -0.430, -0.199, -0.127 and -0.094 ng/mL/month, respectively, for durations of 1, 2, 3 and 4 years following radiotherapy. Similarly, for CF-EBRT, the median slopes were -0.529, -0.138, -0.109 and -0.056 ng/mL/month, respectively. The slope of CF-EBRT was significantly different with a greater median rate of change for 1 year than SBRT (P = 0.018). Conversely, the slopes of SBRT for duration for 2, 3 and 4 year tended to be continuously greater than CF-EBRT (P = 0.028, P = 0.058 and P = 0.128, respectively). The significantly lower PSA nadir was observed in SBRT (nadir 0.23 ng/mL) compared with CF-EBRT (nadir 0.37 ng/mL) (P = 0.011). Five-year BCF free survivals were 100% for SBRT and 80.8% for CF-EBRT (P = 0.031).  Conclusions:   Patients treated with SBRT experienced a lower PSA nadir and tended to a continuously greater rate of decline of PSA for duration 2, 3 and 4 years than CF-EBRT. The improved PSA kinetics of SBRT leaded to favorable BCF-free survival.""","""['Seok Ho Lee', 'Hun Jung Kim', 'Woo Chul Kim']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen kinetics following hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost as post-external beam radiotherapy versus conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated SBRT versus conventionally fractionated EBRT for prostate cancer: comparison of PSA slope and nadir.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics following hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost and whole pelvic radiotherapy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Patients with Early-stage Prostate Cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: An ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA Evidence-Based Guideline.', 'Cyberknife Radioablation of Prostate Cancer – Preliminary Results for 400 Patients.']"""

Consequently, CBCT images cannot be used directly for radiotherapy dose calculation. The aim of this study is to enable dose calculations to be performed with the use of CBCT images taken during radiotherapy and evaluate the necessity of replanning.  Methods:   A patient with prostate cancer with bilateral metallic prosthetic hip replacements was imaged using both CT and CBCT. The multilevel threshold (MLT) algorithm was used to categorize pixel values in the CBCT images into segments of homogeneous HU. The variation in HU with position in the CBCT images was taken into consideration. This segmentation method relies on the operator dividing the CBCT data into a set of volumes where the variation in the relationship between pixel values and HUs is small. An automated MLT algorithm was developed to reduce the operator time associated with the process. An intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan was generated from CT images of the patient. The plan was then copied to the segmented CBCT (sCBCT) data sets with identical settings, and the doses were recalculated and compared.  Results:   Gamma evaluation showed that the percentage of points in the rectum with γ < 1 (3%/3 mm) were 98.7% and 97.7% in the sCBCT using MLT and the automated MLT algorithms, respectively. Compared with the planning CT (pCT) plan, the MLT algorithm showed -0.46% dose difference with 8 h operator time while the automated MLT algorithm showed -1.3%, which are both considered to be clinically acceptable, when using collapsed cone algorithm.  Conclusion:   The segmentation of CBCT images using the method in this study can be used for dose calculation. For a patient with prostate cancer with bilateral hip prostheses and the associated issues with CT imaging, the MLT algorithms achieved a sufficient dose calculation accuracy that is clinically acceptable. The automated MLT algorithm reduced the operator time associated with implementing the MLT algorithm to achieve clinically acceptable accuracy. This saved time makes the automated MLT algorithm superior and easier to implement in the clinical setting.  Advances in knowledge:   The MLT algorithm has been extended to the complex example of a patient with bilateral hip prostheses, which with the introduction of automation is feasible for use in adaptive radiotherapy, as an alternative to obtaining a new pCT and reoutlining the structures.""","""['Turki Almatani', 'Richard P Hugtenburg', 'Ryan D Lewis', 'Susan E Barley', 'Mark A Edwards']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Evaluation of on-board kV cone beam computed tomography-based dose calculation with deformable image registration using Hounsfield unit modifications.', 'Enhancement of Hounsfield unit distribution in cone-beam CT images for adaptive radiation therapy: Evaluation of a hybrid correction approach.', 'Investigating deformable image registration and scatter correction for CBCT-based dose calculation in adaptive IMPT.', 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', 'Megavoltage CT images of helical tomotherapy unit for radiation treatment simulation: impact on feasibility of treatment planning in a prostate cancer patient with bilateral femoral prostheses.', 'Evaluation of dose accumulation methods and workflows utilising cone beam computed tomography images.', 'Feasibility evaluation of kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography dose calculation following scatter correction: investigations of phantom and representative tumor sites.', 'Geometric and Dosimetric Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation on CBCT-Synthesized CT and Planning CT for Breast Cancer Adaptive Radiotherapy: A Multi-Institutional Study.', 'Cone Beam CT (CBCT) Based Synthetic CT Generation Using Deep Learning Methods for Dose Calculation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy.', 'Pelvic multi-organ segmentation on cone-beam CT for prostate adaptive radiotherapy.']"""

We used these to estimate the probability of finding PCa on prostate biopsy, on an individual basis.  Materials and methods:   A total of 371 men who had undergone transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy were enrolled in the present study. Given that PCa risk relates to the total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) level, age, prostate volume, free PSA (fPSA), fPSA/tPSA ratio, and PSA density and that tPSA ≥ 50 ng/mL has a 98.5% positive predictive value for a PCa diagnosis, we hypothesized that correlating 2 variables composed of 3 ratios (1, tPSA/age; 2, tPSA/prostate volume; and 3, fPSA/tPSA; 1 variable including the patient's tPSA and the other, a tPSA value of 50 ng/mL) could operate as a PCa conditions imitating/simulating model. Linear regression analysis was used to derive the coefficient of determination (R2), termed the PCRD index. To estimate the PCRD index's predictive validity, we used the χ2 test, multiple logistic regression analysis with PCa risk equation formation, calculation of test performance characteristics, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis using SPSS, version 22 (P < .05).  Results:   The biopsy findings were positive for PCa in 167 patients (45.1%) and negative in 164 (44.2%). The PCRD index was positively signed in 89.82% positive PCa cases and negative in 91.46% negative PCa cases (χ2 test; P < .001; relative risk, 8.98). The sensitivity was 89.8%, specificity was 91.5%, positive predictive value was 91.5%, negative predictive value was 89.8%, positive likelihood ratio was 10.5, negative likelihood ratio was 0.11, and accuracy was 90.6%. Multiple logistic regression revealed the PCRD index as an independent PCa predictor, and the formulated risk equation was 91% accurate in predicting the probability of finding PCa. On the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the PCRD index (area under the curve, 0.926) significantly (P < .001) outperformed other, established PCa predictors.  Conclusion:   The PCRD index effectively predicted the prostate biopsy outcome, correctly identifying 9 of 10 men who were eventually diagnosed with PCa and correctly ruling out PCa for 9 of 10 men who did not have PCa. Its predictive power significantly outperformed established PCa predictors, and the formulated risk equation accurately calculated the probability of finding cancer on biopsy, on an individual patient basis.""","""['Evangelos Spyropoulos', 'Dimitrios Kotsiris', 'Katherine Spyropoulos', 'Aggelos Panagopoulos', 'Ioannis Galanakis', 'Stamatios Mavrikos']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Serum isoform -2proPSA derivatives significantly improve prediction of prostate cancer at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml: a multicentric European study.', 'Evaluation of prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivates, %p2PSA, prostate health index and prostate dimension-adjusted related index in the detection of prostate cancer at first biopsy: an exploratory, prospective study.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Simultaneous 18F-fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Method:   Eighty men undergoing AdVance sling for PPI during 2008-2013 were reviewed. Pre-op urodynamics, pre and post-op pad usage, prior radiotherapy, and PGI-I scores were recorded.  Result:   Mean follow-up was 36 months (range 14-72). Twelve men had radiotherapy pre-op, 10 had detrusor overactivity (DO), and 20 reduced compliance. Pre-op mean 24-hr pad weight was 264 g and mean pads-per-day (PPD) 2.60 ± 0.29. In the early post-op period (3-6 months), mean PPD was 0.40 (SD 0.16); at mid-term follow-up mean PPD was 1.02 ± 0.31. Radiotherapy and DO were independently predictive of poor mid-term outcome. Men with DO or radiotherapy were using 1.03 ± 0.42 (P = 0.019) and 1.17 ± 0.41 (P = 0.02) more PPD, respectively than men without these factors. At mid-term follow-up, men without radiotherapy or DO were using 1.98 ± 0.28 less PPD compared to pre-operatively (P < 0.0001); with radiotherapy or DO men were using 0.73 ± 0.38 (P = 0.057) and 0.72 ± 0.43 (P = 0.092) less PPD, respectively. PGI-I score for men without radiotherapy or DO was 1.98 ± 0.40 (""much better""); with radiotherapy or DO PGI-I score was 3.80 ± 0.49 (""no difference"").  Conclusion:   The AdVance sling provides mid-term improvement in men with PPI. However, men with radiotherapy or DO have significantly poorer outcomes with mid-term results indicating a return to baseline degree of incontinence. Caution should be taken when considering the AdVance sling in these men. Pre-op urodynamics in men with radiotherapy and/or overactive bladder may be important when considering men for AdVance sling.
