Unfortunately, few are reproducibly linked to aggressive disease, the phenotype of greatest clinical relevance. One possible explanation is that rare genetic variants underlie a significant proportion of the risk for aggressive disease.  Method:   To identify such variants, we performed a two-stage approach using whole-exome sequencing followed by targeted sequencing of 800 genes in 652 aggressive prostate cancer patients and 752 disease-free controls in both African and European Americans. In each population, we tested rare variants for association using two gene-based aggregation tests. We established a study-wide significance threshold of 3.125 × 10-5 to correct for multiple testing.  Results:   TET2 in African Americans was associated with aggressive disease, with 24.4% of cases harboring a rare deleterious variant compared with 9.6% of controls (FET P = 1.84 × 10-5, OR = 3.0; SKAT-O P = 2.74 × 10-5). We report 8 additional genes with suggestive evidence of association, including the DNA repair genes PARP2 and MSH6 Finally, we observed an excess of rare truncation variants in 5 genes, including the DNA repair genes MSH6, BRCA1, and BRCA2 This adds to the growing body of evidence that DNA repair pathway defects may influence susceptibility to aggressive prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that rare variants influence risk of clinically relevant prostate cancer and, if validated, could serve to identify men for screening, prophylaxis, and treatment.  Impact:   This study provides evidence that rare variants in TET2 may help identify African American men at increased risk for clinically relevant prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   The subjects were 114 men who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy with patient specific mold processing of the specimen from 2013 to 2015. T2-weighted images were used to contour the prostate capsule and cancer suspicious regions of interest. The contours were used to design and print 3-dimensional custom molds, which permitted alignment of excised prostates with magnetic resonance imaging scans. Tumors were reconstructed in 3 dimensions from digitized whole mount sections. Tumors were then matched with regions of interest and the relative geometries were compared.  Results:   Of the 222 tumors evident on whole mount sections 118 had been identified on magnetic resonance imaging. For the 118 regions of interest mean volume was 0.8 cc and the longest 3-dimensional diameter was 17 mm. However, for matched pathological tumors, of which most were Gleason score 3 + 4 or greater, mean volume was 2.5 cc and the longest 3-dimensional diameter was 28 mm. The median tumor had a 13.5 mm maximal extent beyond the magnetic resonance imaging contour and 80% of cancer volume from matched tumors was outside region of interest boundaries. Size estimation was most accurate in the axial plane and least accurate along the base-apex axis.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging consistently underestimates the size and extent of prostate tumors. Prostate cancer foci had an average diameter 11 mm longer and a volume 3 times greater than T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging segmentations. These results may have important implications for the assessment and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Alan Priester', 'Shyam Natarajan', 'Pooria Khoshnoodi', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Steven S Raman', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Warren Grundfest', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Re: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Underestimation of Prostate Cancer Geometry: Use of Patient Specific Molds to Correlate Images with Whole Mount Pathology: A.

Once disseminated, the prognosis is poor as these tumors often display generalized chemoresistance, particularly for carcinomas that derive not from the aerodigestive tract. When these cancers seed the liver, the aggressive cells usually undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition that both aids colonization and renders the tumor cells chemoresistant. In vitro studies demonstrate that hepatocytes drive this phenotypic shift. However, the in vivo evidence and the molecular signals that protect these cells from induced death are yet to be defined. Herein, we report that membrane surface E-cadherin-expressing prostate cancer cells were resistant to cell death by chemotherapeutic drugs but E-cadherin null cells or those expressing E-cadherin only in the cytoplasm were sensitive to death signals and chemotherapies both in vitro and in vivo. While cell-cell E-cadherin ligandation reduced mitogenesis, this chemoprotection was proliferation-independent as killing of both 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-positive (or Ki67+ ) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-negative (Ki67- ) cells was inversely related to membrane-bound E-cadherin. Inhibiting the canonical survival kinases extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, protein kinase B, and Janus kinase, which are activated by chemotherapeutics in epithelial cell-transitioned prostate cancer, abrogated the chemoresistance both in cell culture and in animal models of metastatic cancer. For disseminated tumors, protein kinase B disruption in itself had no effect on tumor survival but was synergistic with chemotherapy, leading to increased killing.  Conclusion:   Liver microenvironment-driven phenotypic switching of carcinoma cells and subsequent survival signaling results in activation of canonical survival pathways that protect the disseminated prostate cancer liver micrometastases in a proliferation-independent manner, and these pathways can be targeted as an adjuvant treatment to improve the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutics (Hepatology 2016;64:1725-1742).""","""['Bo Ma', 'Sarah E Wheeler', 'Amanda M Clark', 'Diana L Whaley', 'Min Yang', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Hepatology""","""['Friend or foe: role of E-cadherin in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in hepatocyte-mediated phenotypic switching in prostate cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Co-culturing human prostate carcinoma cells with hepatocytes leads to increased expression of E-cadherin.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing factor TWIST is an attractive target in advanced and/or metastatic bladder and prostate cancers.', 'E-cadherin as an indicator of mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transitions during the metastatic seeding of disseminated carcinomas.', 'Liver Microenvironment Response to Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Hormonal Therapy.', 'Interferon-γ increases sensitivity to chemotherapy and provides immunotherapy targets in models of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Autophagy and Hepatic Tumor Microenvironment Associated Dormancy.', 'Akt isoforms differentially provide for chemoresistance in prostate cancer.', 'Atorvastatin facilitates chemotherapy effects in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.']"""

However, it is not clear which mechanisms drive this association within the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this pilot study was to examine prostatic inflammation via tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages characterized by obesity and cancer severity.  Methods:   We studied paraffin-embedded prostatectomy tissue from 99 participants (63 non-obese and 36 obese) from the Study of Clinical Outcomes, Risk and Ethnicity (University of Pennsylvania). Pathologists analyzed the tissue for type and count of lymphocytes and macrophages, including CD3, CD8, FOXP3, and CD68. Pathology data were linked to clinical and demographic variables. Statistical analyses included frequency tables, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Spearman correlations, and multivariable models.  Results:   We observed positive univariate associations between the number of CD68 cells and tumor grade (p = 0.019). In multivariable analysis, CD8 counts were associated with time to biochemical failure (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.004-1.192, p-value = 0.041.) There were no differences in lymphocytes or macrophages by obesity status or BMI.  Conclusions:   The number of lymphocytes and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment did not differ by obesity status. However, these inflammation markers were associated with poor prostate cancer outcomes. Further examination of underlying mechanisms that influence obesity-related effects on prostate cancer outcomes is warranted.

The CE of TW (in combination with Dtx) was evaluated in two Dtx resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR) and the efficacy of the combination for resistant PC3-TxR tumor was investigated using a xenograft mouse model. For mechanistic study, the inhibitory effect of TW on P-glycoprotein activity was assessed. In addition, novel gene targets of TW were identified using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR. Results showed that TW induced a CE of 8 and >38 folds in PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells, respectively with Dtx IC50 reversed back to that of the sensitive parent cells. An optimum dose of TW+Dtx significantly retarded tumor growth in mice compared to TW or Dtx alone. TW inhibited P-glycoprotein activity and induced a significant gene expression changes in genes related to angiogenesis, cell cycle regulation and differentiation.

In the present study we established three different cellular models of enzalutamide resistance including a cell line with wild type AR (LAPC4), DuCaP cells which overexpress wild-type AR, as well as a cell which has been adapted to long term androgen ablation (LNCaP Abl) and harbors the AR T878A mutation.

When compared to controls, resistant cells exhibit significantly decreased sensitivity to enzalutamide as measured with 3[H]thymidine incorporation and WST assay. Moreover, these cell models exhibit partly re-activated AR signaling despite presence of enzalutamide. In addition, we show that enzalutamide resistant cells are insensitive to bicalutamide but retain considerable sensitivity to abiraterone.

The disease is also more aggressive in this group possibly due to biologically more aggressive tumor or late presentation. Currently, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay plays a significant role in making the diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, the obtained value of serum PSA may not directly relate with the Gleason score (GS), a measure of tumor aggression in prostate cancer. This study explores the relationship between serum total PSA at presentation (iPSA) and GS.  Patients and methods:   The iPSA of patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer was compared with the obtained GS of the prostate biopsy specimens. The age of the patients at presentation and the prostate volumes were also analyzed with respect to the iPSA and GS. The data were analyzed retrospectively using IBM SPSS Version 20. Pearson correlation was used for numeric variables, whereas Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. Significance was set at P≤0.05.  Results:   There were 205 patients from January 2010 to November 2013 who satisfied the inclusion criteria. iPSA as well as age at presentation and prostate volume were not found to significantly correlate with the primary Gleason grade, the secondary Gleason grade, or the GS. However, the presence of distant metastasis was identified to significantly correlate positively with GS.  Conclusion:   GS may not be confidently predicted by the iPSA.

Metastasis is the primary cause of prostate cancer mortality. Survival rate is only 28% for metastatic patients, but is nearly 100% for patients with localized prostate cancers. Molecular mechanisms that underlie this malignancy remain obscure, and this study investigated the role of SPARC/osteonectin, cwcv, and kazal-like domain proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1) in prostate cancer progression. Initially, we found that SPOCK1 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues relative to noncancerous tissues. In particular, SPOCK1 expression was also markedly high in metastatic tissues compared with nonmetastatic cancerous tissues. SPOCK1 expression knockdown by specific short hairpin RNA in PC3 cells was significantly inhibited, whereas SPOCK1 overexpression in RWPE-1 cells promoted cell viability, colony formation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, the SPOCK1 knockdown in PC3 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, while the SPOCK1 overexpression in RWPE-1 cells induced cell cycle arrest in S phase. The SPOCK1 knockdown in PC3 cells even increased cell apoptosis. SPOCK1 modulation was also observed to affect cancerous cell proliferation and apoptotic processes in the mouse model of prostate cancer. Additionally, the SPOCK1 knockdown decreased, whereas the SPOCK1 overexpression increased cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro. Injection of SPOCK1-depleted PC3 cells significantly decreased metastatic nodules in mouse lungs. These findings suggest that SPOCK1 is a critical mediator of tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer.""","""['Qi Chen', 'Yuan-Ting Yao', 'Huan Xu', 'Yan-Bo Chen', 'Meng Gu', 'Zhi-Kang Cai', 'Zhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'SPOCK1 as a potential cancer prognostic marker promotes the proliferation and metastasis of gallbladder cancer cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'A potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target: SPOCK1 promotes the proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.', 'SPOCK1: a multi-domain proteoglycan at the crossroads of extracellular matrix remodeling and cancer development.', 'SPOCK1 Involvement in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition: A New Target in Cancer Therapy?', 'LINC00562 drives gastric cancer development by regulating miR-4636-AP1S3 axis.', 'SPOCK1 Overexpression Suggests Poor Prognosis of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Proteoglycan SPOCK1 as a Poor Prognostic Marker Promotes Malignant Progression of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma via Triggering the Snail/Slug-MMP-2 Axis-Mediated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Leucine zipper protein 2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer correlating with immune infiltration and epigenetic regulation.', 'Epigenetic analysis in placentas from sickle cell disease patients reveals a hypermethylation profile.']"""

Here, we sought to study the impact of reagent circulating half-life on ""active"" and ""passive"" tumor uptake. The humanized prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting antibody HuJ591 was used as the ""active"" targeting agent.

""Active"" and ""passive"" tumor targeting of intravenously injected antibody conjugates were then quantified by NIR fluorescent imaging of immunocompromised mice bearing bilateral isogenic PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative human tumor xenografts. Two isogenic tumor pairs were applied, PC3 ± PSMA (PC3-PIP/PC3-Flu) or LMD-MDA-MB-231 ± PSMA (LMD-PSMA/LMD). This study provided a unique model system to simultaneously observe ""active"" and ""passive"" tumor targeting within a single animal. ""Passive"" targeting was observed in all PSMA-negative tumors, and was not enhanced by increased HuJ591 size or extended circulating half-life.

Upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and function is characteristic of MYC-driven tumors. In addition, PIM kinases activate MYC signaling and mRNA translation in prostate cancer and cooperate with MYC to accelerate tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the efficacy of a single and dual approach targeting ribosome biogenesis and function to treat prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   The inhibition of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis with CX-5461, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, has been successfully exploited therapeutically but only in models of hematologic malignancy. CX-5461 and CX-6258, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, were tested alone and in combination in prostate cancer cell lines, in Hi-MYC- and PTEN-deficient mouse models and in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of metastatic tissue obtained from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Results:   CX-5461 inhibited anchorage-independent growth and induced cell-cycle arrest in prostate cancer cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg CX-5461 induced TP53 expression and activity and reduced proliferation (MKI67) and invasion (loss of ductal actin) in Hi-MYC tumors, but not in PTEN-null (low MYC) tumors. While 100 mg/kg CX-6258 showed limited effect alone, its combination with CX-5461 further suppressed proliferation and dramatically reduced large invasive lesions in both models. This rational combination strategy significantly inhibited proliferation and induced cell death in PDX of prostate cancer.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment of cancer-associated VTE, but it is unclear how frequently these are followed. This study assessed anticoagulation treatment patterns for VTE in newly diagnosed cancer patients in the United States.  Materials and methods:   MarketScan® claims records of more than 80 million insured members between January 1, 2009 and July 31, 2014 were retrospectively analyzed.

Results:   VTE developed in 6.2% of cancer patients (median, 181days after cancer diagnosis). VTE rates were highest for pancreatic (17.5%) and lung (12.6%) cancer and lowest for breast (4.2%) and prostate (4.1%) cancer. For patients for whom outpatient prescription data were available, warfarin was most commonly used (50.0%), followed by LMWH (40.0%) and other anticoagulants (10.0%). Over 6months, 13% of patients who initiated injectable anticoagulants remained on them compared with 30% of those who initiated oral anticoagulants. More patients switched from LMWH to warfarin and other anticoagulants (44%) versus those who switched from warfarin (28%).

For each CBCT, the bladder and rectum were contoured and volume sizes were normalized to those on their original CT. The daily delivered dose was recalculated on the CBCT images and the doses to bladder and rectum were investigated. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the mean dose change of the volume change using SPSS 19.  Results:   The data show that the variances of the normalized volume of the bladder and the rectum are 0.13-0.58 and 0.12-0.50 respectively. The variances of V70Gy, V60Gy, V50Gy, V40Gy and V30Gy of bladder are bigger than those of rectum for 17 patients. The linear regression analysis indicates a 10 % increase in bladder volume will cause a 5.6 % (±4.9 %) reduction in mean dose (p <0.05).  Conclusions:   The bladder's volume change is more significant than that of the rectum for the prostate cancer patient. The rectum volume variations are not significant except for air bubbles, which change the shape and the position of the rectum. The bladder volume variations may cause dose changes proportionately.

Prostate cancer progression is associated with aberrant O-glycosylation of cancer cell surface receptors, but the functional impact of such events is uncertain. Here we report spontaneous metastasis of human prostate cancer xenografts that express high levels of galectin-4 along with genetic signatures of EGFR-HER2 signaling and O-glycosylation. Galectin-4 expression in clinical specimens of prostate cancer correlated with poor patient survival. Galectin-4 binding to multiple receptor tyrosine kinases stimulated their autophosphorylation, activated expression of pERK, pAkt, fibronectin, and Twist1, and lowered expression of E-cadherin, thereby facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. In vivo investigations established that galectin-4 expression enabled prostate cancer cells to repopulate tumors in orthotopic and heterotopic tissues. Notably, these effects of galectin-4 relied upon O-glycosylation mediated by C1GALT1, a galactosyltransferase implicated in other cancers. Parallel changes in galectin-4 and O-glycosylation triggered aberrant receptor signaling and more aggressive invasive character in prostate cancer cells, which through better survival in the circulation also contributed to the bulk cell progeny of distal tumors. Our findings establish galectin-4 and C1GALT1-mediated glycosylation in a signaling axis that is activated during prostate cancer progression, with implications for therapeutic targeting of advanced metastatic disease.

The procedural time was recorded. The level of pain experienced during the procedure was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS), and the rate of complications was evaluated in comparison of the two methods.  Results:   The procedural time was significantly shorter in the first group (p < 0.001). In the first group, pain occurred less frequently (p = 0.002), with a significantly lower VAS score being experienced (p < 0.002). No patient had post procedural fever.

We thus analyzed immune cell subsets within peripheral blood mononuclear cells to determine if a ""peripheral immunoscore"" could have any prognostic significance for patients before receiving immunotherapy. Patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel ± PANVAC vaccine. In another trial, prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone lesions were randomly assigned to receive a bone-seeking radionuclide ± PROSTVAC vaccine. Predefined analyses of ""classic"" immune cell types (CD4, CD8, natural killer cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and ratios) revealed no differences in progression-free survival (PFS) for either arm in both trials. Predefined analyses of refined immune cell subsets for which a biologic function had been previously reported also showed no significant prognostic value in PFS for patients receiving either docetaxel or radionuclide alone; however, in patients receiving these agents in combination with vaccine, the peripheral immunoscore of refined subsets revealed statistically significant differences in PFS (P < 0.001) for breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel plus vaccine, and in prostate cancer patients receiving radionuclide plus vaccine (P = 0.004).

However, ADT has well documented side effects that could alter the patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The current study aims to test whether a genetic stratification could provide better knowledge for optimising ADT options to minimize HRQoL effects.  Methods:   A cohort of 206 PC survivors (75 treated with and 131 without ADT) was recruited with written consent to collect patient characteristics, clinical data and HRQoL data related to PC management. The primary outcomes were the percentage scores under each HRQoL subscale assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and PR25) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales developed by the University of Melbourne, Australia. Genotyping of these men was carried out for the aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C3 (AKR1C3) rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Analysis of HRQoL scores were carried out against ADT duration and in association with the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP using the generalised linear model. P-values <0 · 05 were considered significant, and were further tested for restriction with Bonferroni correction.  Results:   Increase in hormone treatment-related effects were recorded with long-term ADT compared to no ADT. The C and G allele frequencies of the AKR1C3rs12529 SNP were 53·4 % and 46·6 % respectively. Hormone treatment-related symptoms showed an increase with ADT when associated with the AKR1C3 rs12529 G allele. Meanwhile, decreasing trends on cancer-specific symptoms and increased sexual interest were recorded with no ADT when associated with the AKR1C3 rs12529 G allele and reverse trends with the C allele. As higher incidence of cancer-specific symptoms relate to cancer retention it is possible that associated with the C allele there could be higher incidence of unresolved cancers under no ADT options.  Conclusions:   If these findings can be reproduced in larger homogeneous cohorts, a genetic stratification based on the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP, can minimize ADT-related HRQoL effects in PC patients. Our data additionally show that with this stratification it could also be possible to identify men needing ADT for better oncological advantage.""","""['Nishi Karunasinghe', 'Yifei Zhu', 'Dug Yeo Han', 'Katja Lange', 'Shuotun Zhu', 'Alice Wang', 'Stephanie Ellett', 'Jonathan Masters', 'Megan Goudie', 'Justin Keogh', 'Benji Benjamin', 'Michael Holmes', 'Lynnette R Ferguson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Interaction between leukocyte aldo-keto reductase 1C3 activity, genotypes, biological, lifestyle and clinical features in a prostate cancer cohort from New Zealand.', 'Influence of lifestyle and genetic variants in the aldo-keto reductase 1C3 rs12529 polymorphism in high-risk prostate cancer detection variability assessed between US and New Zealand cohorts.', 'Polymorphisms in androgen metabolism genes with serum testosterone levels and prognosis in androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Improving the management of patients with prostate cancer receiving long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Contemporary use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: managing complications and addressing quality-of-life issues.', 'Germline Mutations in Steroid Metabolizing Enzymes: A Focus on Steroid Transforming Aldo-Keto Reductases.', 'Characterization of the major single nucleotide polymorphic variants of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).', 'Interaction between leukocyte aldo-keto reductase 1C3 activity, genotypes, biological, lifestyle and clinical features in a prostate cancer cohort from New Zealand.', 'Prostate Cancer: Is It a Battle Lost to Age?', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.']"""

None of these trials systematically included patients who underwent early salvage radiation therapy (esRT).  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that aRT was associated with better cancer control and survival compared with observation followed by esRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a multi-institutional cohort from seven tertiary referral centres, we retrospectively identified 510 pT3pN0 patients with undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RP between 1996 and 2009. Patients were stratified into two groups: aRT (group 1) versus observation followed by esRT in case of PSA relapse (group 2). Specifically, esRT was administered at a PSA level ≤0.5ng/ml.  Intervention:   We compared aRT versus observation followed by esRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The evaluated outcomes were MFS and OS. Multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the association between groups (aRT vs observation followed by esRT) and oncologic outcomes. Covariates consisted of pathologic stage (pT3a vs pT3b or higher), pathologic Gleason score (≤6, 7, or ≥8), surgical margin status (negative vs positive), and year of surgery. An interaction with groups and baseline patient risk was tested for the hypothesis that the impact of aRT versus observation followed by esRT was different by pathologic characteristics. The nonparametric curve fitting method was used to explore graphically the relationship between MFS and OS at 8 yr and baseline patient risk (derived from the multivariable analysis).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 243 patients (48%) underwent aRT, and 267 (52%) underwent initial observation. Within the latter group, 141 patients experienced PSA relapse and received esRT. Median follow-up after RP was 94 mo (interquartile range [IQR]: 53-126) and 92 mo (IQR: 70-136), respectively (p=0.2). MFS (92% vs 91%; p=0.9) and OS (89% vs 92%; p=0.9) at 8 yr after surgery were not significantly different between the two groups. These results were confirmed in multivariable analysis, in which observation followed by esRT was not associated with a significantly higher risk of distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.35; p=0.4) and overall mortality (HR: 1.39; p=0.4) compared with aRT. Using the nonparametric curve fitting method, a comparable proportion of MFS and OS at 8 yr among groups was observed regardless of pathologic cancer features (p=0.9 and p=0.7, respectively). Limitations consisted of the retrospective nature of the study and the relatively small size of the patient population.  Conclusions:   At long-term follow-up, no significant differences between aRT and esRT were observed for MFS and OS. Our study, although based on retrospective data, suggests that esRT does not compromise cancer control and potentially reduces overtreatment associated with aRT.  Patient summary:   At long-term follow-up, no significant differences in terms of distant metastasis and mortality were observed between immediate postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) and initial observation followed by early salvage radiation therapy (esRT) in case of prostate-specific antigen relapse.

Cisplatin, also known as cis‑diamminedichloroplatinum or DDP, is a standard chemotherapeutic agent used to treat prostate cancer; however, it has the disadvantage of various serious side effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of LSD1 knockdown, and the interplay between LSD1 and DDP, on prostate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion, and, therefore, the potential of LSD1 as a target for prostate cancer therapy. Flow cytometric analysis, Cell Counting kit 8 assay, Transwell assay and western blotting results revealed that LSD1 knockdown, in combination with DDP treatment, exerted antiproliferative, proapoptotic and anti‑invasive effects on PC3 prostate cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of LSD1 acted synergistically with DDP, thereby enhancing the induction of apoptosis, and the inhibition of proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer cells.

Active Surveillance (AS) has been developed to allow men with lower risk disease to postpone or avoid the adverse side effects associated with curative treatments until the disease progresses. Despite the medical benefits of AS, it is reported that living with untreated cancer can create a significant emotional burden for patients.  Methods/design:   The aim of this study is to gain insight into the experiences of men eligible to undergo AS for favourable-risk PCa. This study has a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design consisting of two phases: quantitative followed by qualitative. Phase 1 has a multiple point, prospective, longitudinal exploratory design. Ninety men diagnosed with favourable-risk prostate cancer will be assessed immediately post-diagnosis (baseline) and followed over a period of 12 months, in intervals of 3 month. Ninety age-matched men with no cancer diagnosis will also be recruited using peer nomination and followed up in the same 3 month intervals. Following completion of Phase 1, 10-15 AS participants who have reported both the best and worst psychological functioning will be invited to participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Phase 2 will facilitate further exploration of the quantitative results and obtain a richer understanding of participants' personal interpretations of their illness and psychological wellbeing.

The synthesis of AgNPs using Plumbago zeylanica (Pz), Semecarpus anacardium (Sa) and Terminalia arjuna (Ta) plant extracts in the reaction mixture was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. FTIR results clearly illustrated that the plant extracts containing prominent peaks of functional groups and biomolecules viz., tannins, phenols, flavonoids and triterpenoids those act as capping agents and involved in the stabilization of the synthesised silver nanoparticles. Synthesized AgNPs were spherical and cuboid in shape which is determined by SEM. Average size of the AgNPs were between 80-98, 60-95 and 34-70 nm for PzAgNPs, SaAgNPs and TaAgNPs, respectively. Further, the synthesized AgNPs were characterized by XRD, EDX, DLS and Zeta potential analysis. Moreover, the synthesized AgNPs exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human liver and prostate cancer cell lines.

Risk stratification is the cornerstone for clinical decision making and treatment selection for these men. The most widely applied stratification systems use presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, biopsy Gleason grade, and clinical stage to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk. There is, however, significant heterogeneity in outcomes within these standard groupings. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has recently adopted a prognosis-based pathological classification that has yet to be included within a risk stratification system. Here we developed and tested a new stratification system based on the number of individual risk factors and incorporating the new ISUP prognostic score.  Methods and findings:   Diagnostic clinicopathological data from 10,139 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer were available for this study from the Public Health England National Cancer Registration Service Eastern Office. This cohort was divided into a training set (n = 6,026; 1,557 total deaths, with 462 from prostate cancer) and a testing set (n = 4,113; 1,053 total deaths, with 327 from prostate cancer). The median follow-up was 6.9 y, and the primary outcome measure was prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). An external validation cohort (n = 1,706) was also used. Patients were first categorised as low, intermediate, or high risk using the current three-stratum stratification system endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The variables used to define the groups (PSA concentration, Gleason grading, and clinical stage) were then used to sub-stratify within each risk category by testing the individual and then combined number of risk factors. In addition, we incorporated the new ISUP prognostic score as a discriminator. Using this approach, a new five-stratum risk stratification system was produced, and its prognostic power was compared against the current system, with PCSM as the outcome. The results were analysed using a Cox hazards model, the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves, competing-risks regression, and concordance indices. In the training set, the new risk stratification system identified distinct subgroups with different risks of PCSM in pair-wise comparison (p < 0.0001). Specifically, the new classification identified a very low-risk group (Group 1), a subgroup of intermediate-risk cancers with a low PCSM risk (Group 2, hazard ratio [HR] 1.62 [95% CI 0.96-2.75]), and a subgroup of intermediate-risk cancers with an increased PCSM risk (Group 3, HR 3.35 [95% CI 2.04-5.49]) (p < 0.0001). High-risk cancers were also sub-classified by the new system into subgroups with lower and higher PCSM risk: Group 4 (HR 5.03 [95% CI 3.25-7.80]) and Group 5 (HR 17.28 [95% CI 11.2-26.67]) (p < 0.0001), respectively. These results were recapitulated in the testing set and remained robust after inclusion of competing risks. In comparison to the current risk stratification system, the new system demonstrated improved prognostic performance, with a concordance index of 0.75 (95% CI 0.72-0.77) versus 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.71) (p < 0.0001). In an external cohort, the new system achieved a concordance index of 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) for predicting PCSM versus 0.66 (95% CI 0.63-0.69) (p < 0.0001) for the current NICE risk stratification system. The main limitations of the study were that it was registry based and that follow-up was relatively short.  Conclusions:   A novel and simple five-stratum risk stratification system outperforms the standard three-stratum risk stratification system in predicting the risk of PCSM at diagnosis in men with primary non-metastatic prostate cancer, even when accounting for competing risks. This model also allows delineation of new clinically relevant subgroups of men who might potentially receive more appropriate therapy for their disease. Future research will seek to validate our results in external datasets and will explore the value of including additional variables in the system in order in improve prognostic performance.""","""['Vincent J Gnanapragasam', 'Artitaya Lophatananon', 'Karen A Wright', 'Kenneth R Muir', 'Anna Gavin', 'David C Greenberg']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['On Risk Estimation versus Risk Stratification in Early Prostate Cancer.', 'Individual prognosis at diagnosis in nonmetastatic prostate cancer: Development and external validation of the PREDICT Prostate multivariable model.', 'The Cambridge Prognostic Groups for improved prediction of disease mortality at diagnosis in primary non-metastatic prostate cancer: a validation study.', 'Advancing age within established Gleason score categories and the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).', 'Variability in Outcomes for Patients with Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 7, International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Group 2-3) and Implications for Risk Stratification: A Systematic Review.', 'Use of classical and novel biomarkers as prognostic risk factors for localised prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'The prognostic nomogram for PSA-incongruent low-risk prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Immune-Activated B Cells Are Dominant in Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and External Validation of the STRATified CANcer Surveillance (STRATCANS) Multivariable Model for Predicting Progression in Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Starting Active Surveillance.', 'Gene expression analysis reveals a 5-gene signature for progression-free survival in prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the impact of MRI based diagnostics on pre-treatment disease classification and prognostic model performance in men diagnosed with new prostate cancer from an unscreened population.']"""

We aimed to describe the time trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Portugal, overall and by region, and to estimate the number of incident cases and deaths in 2020. The number of cases and incidence rates in 1998-2009 were collected from the Regional Cancer Registries. The number of deaths and mortality rates were obtained from the WHO mortality database (1988-2003 and 2007-2013) and Statistics Portugal (2004-2006; 1991-2013 by region). JoinPoint analyses were used to identify significant changes in trends in age-standardized incidence and mortality rates. Incidence and mortality predictions for 2020 were performed using Poisson regression models and population projections provided by Statistics Portugal. In Portugal, prostate cancer incidence has been increasing since 1998 (1.8%/year), with the exception of the North Region, with a decrease since 2006 (-3.2%/year). An overall mortality decline has been observed since 1997 (-2.2%/year), although there were two patterns of mortality variation at the regional level: one with an inflection point or significant variation in the rates and the other without significant variation. If these trends are maintained, ∼8600 incident cases and 1700 deaths may be expected to occur in Portugal in 2020. Despite the overall increasing incidence and decreasing mortality, there is a large heterogeneity across regions.

The possible impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on cancer patient survival is unclear. Our objective was to examine survival among elderly patients with RA who develop cancer.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2001 and 2010 were identified from the Texas Cancer Registry and Medicare-linked databases. The cohort was categorized into 3 groups according to the number of claims patients had with a diagnosis of RA in the year prior to the cancer diagnosis: 2-RA (patients with ≥2 claims), 1-RA (1 claim), and no claims. Overall survival was estimated for these groups and for each cancer, using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for covariates.  Results:   The cohort included 139,097 patients with cancer (35,026 breast, 43,181 prostate, 31,103 colorectal, and 29,787 lung); 1.7% had 1 RA claim, and 1.1% had 2 or more. Adjusted hazard ratios for patients in the 2-RA group were 1.41 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21-1.65) for breast and 1.53 (95% CI 1.26-1.85) for prostate. No significant differences were observed for those with colorectal or lung cancer.  Conclusion:   Mortality was increased by 40% and 50%, respectively, in elderly patients with RA who developed breast or prostate cancer, after controlling for other comorbidities. This association was not seen in cancers with shorter survival time (colorectal or lung).

Results:   The ethanol Bane skin extract inhibited proliferation and caused cell death with IC50 values of 2.8 mg/mL on PC3 cells and the IC50 was 6.1 mg/mL on l929 cells. Morphological changes and apoptotic bodies were observed in PC3 cells faced with the ethanol Bane skin extract by staining with Gimsa.  Conclusions:   The ethanol Bane skin extract could repress the growth of PC3 cell line. This inhibitory effect of the Bane extract depended on the dose and the time on PC3.

In particular, unless a particular transporter exists that may transport the agent across the BBB, most agents that are larger than 500 Da or that are hydrophilic will be excluded by the BBB. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in the periphery, has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions. As all agents that target GCPII are hydrophilic and thereby excluded from the CNS, we used GCPII as a platform for demonstrating our MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) technique for delivery of GCPII/PSMA-specific imaging agents to the brain.  Procedures:   Female rats underwent MRgFUS-mediated opening of the BBB. After opening of the BBB, either a radio- or fluorescently labeled ureido-based ligand for GCPII/PSMA was administered intravenously. Brain uptake was assessed for 2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid ([18F]DCFPyL) and YC-27, two compounds known to bind GCPII/PSMA with high affinity, using positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, respectively. Specificity of ligand binding to GCPII/PSMA in the brain was determined with co-administration of a molar excess of ZJ-43, a compound of the same chemical class but different structure from either [18F]DCFPyL or YC-27, which competes for GCPII/PSMA binding.  Results:   Dynamic PET imaging using [18F]DCFPyL demonstrated that target uptake reached a plateau by ∼1 h after radiotracer administration, with target/background ratios continuing to increase throughout the course of imaging, from a ratio of ∼4:1 at 45 min to ∼7:1 by 80 min. NIRF imaging likewise demonstrated delivery of YC-27 to the brain, with clear visualization of tracer in the brain at 24 h. Tissue uptake of both ligands was greatly diminished by ZJ-43 co-administration, establishing specificity of binding of each to GCPII/PSMA. On gross and histological examination, animals showed no evidence for hemorrhage or other deleterious consequences of MRgFUS.

Objective:   To investigate the association between radical local treatment and mortality in men with very high-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Semiecologic study of men aged <80 yr within the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden, diagnosed in 1998-2012 with very high-risk PCa (local clinical stage T4 and/or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level 50-200ng/ml, any N, and M0). Men with locally advanced PCa (local clinical stage T3 and PSA level <50ng/ml, any N, and M0) were used as positive controls.  Intervention:   Proportion of men who received prostatectomy or full-dose radiotherapy in 640 experimental units defined by county, diagnostic period, and age at diagnosis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCa and all-cause mortality rate ratios (MRRs).  Results and limitations:   Both PCa and all-cause mortality were half as high in units in the highest tertile of exposure to radical local treatment compared with units in the lowest tertile (PCa MRR: 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.95; and all-cause MRR: 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.92). The results observed for locally advanced PCa for highest versus lowest tertile of exposure were in agreement with results from randomized trials (PCa MRR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.94; and all-cause MRR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00). Although the semiecologic design minimized selection bias on an individual level, the effect of high therapeutic activity could not be separated from that of high diagnostic activity.  Conclusions:   The substantially lower mortality in units with the highest exposure to radical local treatment suggests that radical treatment decreases mortality even in men with very high-risk PCa for whom such treatment has been considered ineffective.  Patient summary:   Men with very high-risk prostate cancer diagnosed and treated in units with the highest exposure to surgery or radiotherapy had a substantially lower mortality.""","""['Pär Stattin', 'Fredrik Sandin', 'Frederik Birkebæk Thomsen', 'Hans Garmo', 'David Robinson', 'Ingela Franck Lissbrant', 'Håkan Jonsson', 'Ola Bratt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Pär Stattin, Fredrik Sandin, Frederik Birkebæk Thomsen, et al.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of bone metastases on staging prostate MRI and evaluate associations between their MRI features and clinical/pathologic characteristics.  Methods:   Retrospective, IRB-approved study of 3765 patients undergoing prostate MRI for newly diagnosed PCa between 2000 and 2014. The reference standard to calculate the prevalence of bone metastases was bone biopsy and/or ≥1-year follow-up after MRI. In a subsample of 228 patients, the MRI characteristics of bone lesions were recorded by two radiologists independently. Associations between MRI and clinical/pathologic findings, including National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories, were calculated.  Results:   57/3765 patients (1.5%, 95% CI 1.2-2.0%) had bone metastases. No patient with NCCN low-risk PCa (Gleason < 7, PSA < 10 ng/mL, cT1-2a) had bone metastases. In the subsample, ≥1 bone lesion was present on MRI in 74% (95% CI 0.67-0.79) and 72% (95% CI 0.66-0.78) of patients (R1 and R2). Larger lesion diameter (OR 1.33/1.19; p < 0.001 for both readers) and the absence of intralesional fat (OR 0.07/0.11; p = 0.004/0.002 for R1/R2) were significantly associated with bone metastases.

Little is known about the prevalence of vulnerability and predictors of mortality in this population compared to men without a PCa diagnosis. We examined the predictive utility of the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) for mortality in older men with a PCa diagnosis as compared to controls.  Materials and methods:   Men aged ≥65years from an urban geriatrics clinic completed the VES-13 between 2003 and 2008. Each patient with a PCa diagnosis was matched by age to five controls, resulting in 59 patients with a PCa diagnosis and 318 controls. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of a PCa diagnosis and vulnerability on the VES-13 with mortality.  Results and conclusions:   The mean age for men with a PCa diagnosis and controls was 77.9years and 76.1years, respectively. Of those with a PCa diagnosis, 74.6% had no active disease or a rising PSA only. Regardless of PCa diagnosis, vulnerable individuals on the VES-13 were more likely to die during the study period (VES-13≥3: HR=4.46, p<0.01; VES13≥6: HR=3.77, p<0.01). Men with a PCa diagnosis were not more likely to die compared to age-matched controls (VES-13≥3: HR=1.14, p=0.59; VES13≥6: HR=1.06, p=0.83). Vulnerability for men with a PCa diagnosis was more predictive of mortality.

In prostate cancer xenograft studies, the method effectively normalized the confounding baseline variability, and resulted in animal allocations which were supported by RNA-seq profiling of the individual tumours. The matching information increased the statistical power to detect true treatment effects at smaller sample sizes in two castration-resistant prostate cancer models, thereby leading to saving of both animal lives and research costs.

Methods:   All consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent RALP with primary curative intent in January 2008-July 2014 in a large tertiary hospital were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The patients were divided into groups according to whether the biopsy-RALP interval was ≤2, ≤4, ≤6, or >6 weeks. Estimated blood loss and operating room time were surrogates for surgical difficulty. Surgical margin status and continence at the 1 year were surrogates for surgical efficacy. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as two consecutive postoperative prostate serum antigen values of ≥0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   Of the 1446 enrolled patients, the biopsy-RALP interval was ≤2, ≤4, ≤6, and >6 weeks in 145 (10 %), 728 (50.3 %), 1124 (77.7 %), and 322 (22.3 %) patients, respectively.

Subjects and methods:   We identified all men randomized to the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) trial for whom DRE results were available. Men were excluded if they had a history of prostate surgery or incident prostate cancer. Prostate posterior surface area was derived from DRE sagittal and transverse estimates. Relationships between prostate posterior surface area, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and nocturia were analysed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Spearman's rank correlation and multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 30 500 men met the inclusion criteria, with 103 275 screening visits containing paired DRE and PSA data. Digital rectal examination posterior surface area estimates had an ICC of 0.547 (95% CI 0.541-0.554) and were significantly yet modestly correlated with elevated PSA level (rs = 0.18, P < 0.001) and TRUS prostate volume (rs = 0.32, P < 0.001). Prostate posterior surface area was significantly associated with nocturia on multivariable analysis, but was not significant in stratified analysis of men with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, high body mass index, stroke). In men without these risk factors, the highest quintile of DRE posterior surface area had 22% greater odds of nocturia than the lowest quintile (odds ratio 1.216, 95% CI 1.036-1.427).

WD repeat domain 77 (WDR77), also known as p44, MEP50, or WD45, forms a stoichiometric complex with PRMT5. The PRMT5/p44 complex is required for cellular proliferation of lung and prostate epithelial cells during earlier stages of development and is re-activated during prostate and lung tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms by which PRMT5 and p44 promote cellular proliferation are unknown.  Methods:   Expression of PRMT5 and p44 in lung and prostate cancer cells was silenced and their target genes were identified. The regulation of target genes was validated in various cancer cells during lung development and tumorigenesis. Altered expression of target genes was achieved by ectopic cDNA expression and shRNA-mediated silencing.  Results:   PRMT5 and p44 regulate expression of a specific set of genes encoding growth and anti-growth factors, including receptor tyrosine kinases and antiproliferative proteins. Genes whose expression was suppressed by PRMT5 and p44 encoded anti-growth factors and inhibited cell growth when ectopically expressed. In contrast, genes whose expression was enhanced by PRMT5 and p44 encoded growth factors and increased cell growth when expressed. Altered expression of target genes is associated with re-activation of PRMT5 and p44 during lung tumorigenesis.

Patients and Methods A total of 1,106 patients received SRT between January 1987 and July 2013, with median follow-up 8.9 years. Outcomes were estimated using Kaplan-Meier for overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence for biochemical recurrence (BcR), distant metastases (DM), and cause-specific mortality (CSM). Variable associations with outcomes used Cox or Fine-Gray methods, as appropriate. Multiple variable analyses used backward selection with P < .05 for retention. Results In multiple variable analyses, pathologic tumor stage, Gleason score, and pre-SRT PSA were associated with BcR, DM, CSM, and OS; androgen suppression and SRT doses > 68 Gy were associated with BcR; and age was associated with OS. Each pre-SRT PSA doubling increased significantly the relative risk of BcR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; P < .001), DM (HR, 1.32; P < .001), CSM (HR, 1.40; P < .001), and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.12; P = .02). Using a pre-SRT PSA cutoff ≤ 0.5 versus > 0.5 ng/mL, 5-year and 10-year cumulative incidences for BcR were 42% versus 56% and 60% versus 68% ( P < .001), DM 7% versus 14% and 13% versus 25% ( P < .001), CSM 1% versus 4% and 6% versus 13% ( P < .001), and OS of 94% versus 92% and 83% versus 73% ( P > .05). Conclusion SRT outcomes are in part affected by factors associated with prostatectomy findings but may be positively affected by using SRT at lower PSA levels, including reductions in BcR, DM, CSM, and all-cause mortality. These findings argue against prolonged monitoring of detectable postprostatectomy PSA levels that delay initiation of SRT.""","""['Bradley J Stish', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'William S Harmsen', 'Brian J Davis', 'Katherine S Tzou', 'Richard Choo', 'Steven J Buskirk']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Salvage Radiation Therapy for Increasing Prostate-Specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy: Who, When, and How?', 'Reply to N.

Asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3R2 by PRMT6 acts as a repressive mark that antagonizes trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 by the MLL histone H3K4 methyltransferase. PRMT6 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including prostate, bladder and lung cancers; therefore, it is of great interest to develop potent and selective inhibitors for PRMT6. Here, we report the synthesis of a potent bisubstrate inhibitor GMS [6'-methyleneamine sinefungin, an analog of sinefungin (SNF)], and the crystal structures of human PRMT6 in complex, respectively, with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and the bisubstrate inhibitor GMS that shed light on the significantly improved inhibition effect of GMS on methylation activity of PRMT6 compared with SAH and an S-adenosyl-L-methionine competitive methyltransferase inhibitor SNF. In addition, we also crystallized PRMT6 in complex with SAH and a short arginine-containing peptide.

Ignoring the informative drop-out can cause bias in estimation of the longitudinal model. In such cases, a full parametric specification may be insufficient to capture the complicated pattern of the longitudinal biomarkers. For these types of longitudinal data with the issue of informative drop-outs, we develop a joint partially linear model, with an aim to find the trajectory of the longitudinal biomarker. Specifically, an arbitrary function of time along with linear fixed and random covariate effects is proposed in the model for the biomarker, while a flexible semiparametric transformation model is used to describe the drop-out mechanism. Advantages of this semiparametric joint modeling approach are the following: 1) it provides an easier interpretation, compared to standard nonparametric regression models, and 2) it is a natural way to control for common (observable and unobservable) prognostic factors that may affect both the longitudinal trajectory and the drop-out process. We describe a sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure using the EM algorithm, where the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are considered to select the number of knots. We show that the proposed estimators achieve desirable asymptotic properties through empirical process theory.

In this study we report on the development of a high throughput ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPC(2)-MS/MS) method for the analysis of thirteen 11-oxygenated and six canonical C19 steroids isolated from a cell culture matrix. Using an Acquity UPC(2) BEH 2-EP column we found that UPC(2) resulted in superior selectivity, increased chromatographic efficiency and a scattered elution order when compared to conventional reverse phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in sensitivity (5-50 times). The lower limits of quantification ranged between 0.01-10ngmL(-1), while the upper limit of quantification was 100ngmL(-1) for all steroids. Accuracy, precision, intra-day variation, recovery, matrix effects and process efficiency were all evaluated and found to be within acceptable limits. Taken together we show that the increased power of UPC(2)-MS/MS allows the analyst to complete in vitro assays at biologically relevant concentrations for the first time and in so doing determine the routes of steroid metabolism which is vital for studies of androgen responsive cancers, such as prostate cancer, and could highlight new mechanisms of disease progression and new targets for cancer therapy.""","""['Jonathan L Quanson', 'Marietjie A Stander', 'Elzette Pretorius', 'Carl Jenkinson', 'Angela E Taylor', 'Karl-Heinz Storbeck']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Analysis of 52 C19 and C21 steroids by UPC2-MS/MS: Characterising the C11-oxy steroid metabolome in serum.', 'A high-throughput UPC2-MS/MS method for the separation and quantification of C19 and C21 steroids and their C11-oxy steroid metabolites in the classical, alternative, backdoor and 11OHA4 steroid pathways.', ""What's in a whisker?

However, no empirical evidence is available to determine how much a cognitive impairment shortens survival in older patients when cancer treatment is initiated.  Purpose:   To longitudinally investigate how much a cognitive impairment detected at the initiation of cancer treatment influences survival of older patients during a two-year follow-up duration and to compare the predictive value of a cognitive impairment on patients survival with the predictive value of other vulnerabilities associated with older age.  Methods:   Three hundred and fifty-seven consecutive patients (≥65 years old) admitted for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer surgeries were prospectively recruited. A cognitive impairment was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA<26). Socio-demographic, disease-related, and geriatric vulnerabilities were assessed using validated tools. Univariate and subsequent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models stratified for diagnosis (breast/prostate cancer versus colorectal cancer) and disease status (metastatic versus non-metastatic) were used.  Results:   A cognitive impairment was detected in 46% (n = 163) of patients. Survival was significantly influenced by a cognitive impairment (HR = 6.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.07-18.09; p = 0.001), a loss in instrumental autonomy (IADL ≤7) (HR = 3.06; 95% CI = 1.31-7.11; p = 0.009) and fatigue (Mob-T<5) (HR = 5.98; 95% CI = 2.47-14.44; p <0.001).  Conclusions:   During the two years following cancer treatment initiation, older patients with a cognitive impairment were up to six times more likely to die than patients without. Older patients should be screened for cognitive impairments at cancer treatment initiation to enable interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Further studies should address processes underlying the relationship between cognitive impairments and an increased risk of dying in older cancer patients.""","""['Yves Libert', 'Stéphanie Dubruille', 'Cindy Borghgraef', 'Anne-Marie Etienne', 'Isabelle Merckaert', 'Marianne Paesmans', 'Christine Reynaert', 'Myriam Roos', 'Jean-Louis Slachmuylder', 'Sandrine Vandenbossche', 'Dominique Bron', 'Darius Razavi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prediction of incident dementia: impact of impairment in instrumental activities of daily living and mild cognitive impairment-results from the German study on ageing, cognition, and dementia in primary care patients.', 'Incidence and predictors of depression in non-demented primary care attenders aged 75 years and older: results from a 3-year follow-up study.', 'The prevalence and impact of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older vascular surgical patients.', 'An examination of instrumental activities of daily living assessment in older adults and mild cognitive impairment.', 'Is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test better suited than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection among people aged over 60?

The purpose of our proof of concept study was to investigate the use of a medical wire (CellCollector, GILUPI) to isolate CTCs in the blood of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, which allowed CTCs to be counted and molecularly characterized. Forty-three PCa patients in different stages and 11 control subjects were studied. Some randomized samples were used to detect tumor-associated transcripts, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in the isolated CTCs.  Results:   The mean CTC counts were 4.6 CTCs [range, 0-8] in patients with localized PCa, 16.8 CTCs [range, 10-25] in patients with locally advanced PCa, and 26.8 CTCs [range, 0-98] in patients with metastatic PCa. The median follow-up time was 24 months, and there was a significant difference in the cancer-specific survival rates. Patients with CTC counts under 5 CTCs lived significantly longer (p = 0.035) than patients with more than 5 CTCs. We also demonstrated that the captured CTCs could be molecularly characterized. We detected tumor-associated transcripts of EGFR and PSMA in patients with metastatic PCa in 42.8% and 14.3% of the analyzed samples, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that the sensitive isolation and molecular characterization of CTCs can be achieved ex vivo using the wire. Patients with more than 5 CTCs had a mortality risk that was 7.0 times greater that of those with fewer than 5 CTCs (hazard ratio 7.0 95%, CI 1.1-29.39). This proof of concept was required for the approval of the use of the CellCollector in a clinical study for the in vivo isolation of CTCs from the blood stream of PCa patients by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical devices (Germany, BfArM).""","""['Gerit Theil', 'Kersten Fischer', 'Ekkehard Weber', 'Rita Medek', 'Raschid Hoda', 'Klaus Lücke', 'Paolo Fornara']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['In vivo isolation of circulating tumor cells in patients with different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Filtration-based enrichment of circulating tumor cells from all prostate cancer risk groups.', 'Analogous detection of circulating tumor cells using the AccuCyte® -CyteFinder® system and ISET system in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer: a potential surrogate marker of survival.', 'Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Patients at PSA Recurrence and Review of the Literature.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Strategies for Isolating and Propagating Circulating Tumor Cells in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Potential Use of CTCs as Biomarkers in Renal Cancer Patients.', 'In vivo isolation of circulating tumor cells in patients with different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Electrochemical Detection and Point-of-Care Testing for Circulating Tumor Cells: Current Techniques and Future Potentials.']"""

The most significant hallmarks of cancer are directly or indirectly linked to deregulated mitochondria. In this study, we sought to profile mitochondria associated genes in isogenic prostate cell lines with different tumorigenic phenotypes from the same patient. Results. Two isogenic human prostate cell lines RC77N/E (nonmalignant cells) and RC77T/E (malignant cells) were profiled for expression of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism genes by qRT-PCR using the Human Mitochondria and the Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism RT(2) PCR arrays. Forty-seven genes were differentially regulated between the two cell lines. The interaction and regulatory networks of these genes were generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. UCP2 was the most significantly upregulated gene in primary adenocarcinoma cells in the current study. The overexpression of UCP2 upon malignant transformation was further validated using human prostatectomy clinical specimens. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the overexpression of multiple genes that are involved in mitochondria biogenesis, bioenergetics, and modulation of apoptosis. These genes may play a role in malignant transformation and disease progression. The upregulation of some of these genes in clinical samples indicates that some of the differentially transcribed genes could be the potential targets for therapeutic interventions.""","""['Tanya C Burch', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Julius O Nyalwidhe']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Leptin contributes to long-term stabilization of HIF-1α in cancer cells subjected to oxygen limiting conditions.', 'The roles of AIF and Endo G in the apoptotic effects of benzyl isothiocyanate on DU 145 human prostate cancer cells via the mitochondrial signaling pathway.', 'Identifying molecular features for prostate cancer with Gleason 7 based on microarray gene expression profiles.', 'MitomiRs in human inflamm-aging: a hypothesis involving miR-181a, miR-34a and miR-146a.', 'Prostate cancer regulatory networks.', 'Differential Activation of NRF2 Signaling Pathway in Renal-Cell Carcinoma Caki Cell Lines.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Genetic Evidence of Burn-Induced Cardiac Mitochondrial Metabolism Dysfunction.', 'Activation of Mitochondrial 2-Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase by Cocarboxylase in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells A549 Is p53/p21-Dependent and Impairs Cellular Redox State, Mimicking the Cisplatin Action.']"""

This research thus aimed to examine news portrayal of specific cancer types with respect to threat and efficacy, and to investigate whether news portrayal corresponds to actual cancer statistics. A content analysis of 1,138 cancer news stories was conducted, using a representative sample from 23 news outlets (television, newspapers, and other news media) in Korea over a 5-year period from 2008 to 2012. Cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service. Results suggest that threat was most prominent in news stories on pancreatic cancer (with 87% of the articles containing threat information with specific details), followed by liver (80%) and lung cancers (70%), and least in stomach cancer (41%). Efficacy information with details was conveyed most often in articles on colorectal (54%), skin (54%), and liver (50%) cancers, and least in thyroid cancer (17%). In terms of discrepancies between news portrayal and actual statistics, the threat of pancreatic and liver cancers was overreported, whereas the threat of stomach and prostate cancers was underreported. Efficacy information regarding cervical and colorectal cancers was overrepresented in the news relative to cancer statistics; efficacy of lung and thyroid cancers was underreported.

Methods and materials:   In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, we identified 23,790 patients aged 80 years or more with clinically localized PCa treated with either RT or observation between 1991 and 2009. Competing risks analyses focused on cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality, after accounting for confounders. All analyses were repeated after stratification according to grade (well-differentiated vs moderately differentiated vs poorly differentiated disease), race, and United States region, in patients with no comorbidities and in patients with at least 1 comorbidity. Analyses were repeated within most contemporary patients, namely those treated between 2001 and 2009.  Results:   Radiation therapy was associated with more favorable cancer-specific mortality rates than observation in patients with moderately differentiated disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.94; P=.009) and in patients with poorly differentiated disease (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.49-0.69; P<.001). Conversely, the benefit of RT was not observed in well-differentiated disease. The benefit of RT was confirmed in black men (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.35-0.83; P=.004), across all United States regions (all P≤.004), in the subgroups of the healthiest patients (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.57-0.78; P<.001), in patients with at least 1 comorbidity (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.83; P<.001), and in most contemporary patients (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.46-0.66; P<.001).

Opioids are frequently used throughout the course of SRE treatment. This study describes the treatment patterns and incremental use of opioids in MPC patients diagnosed with SREs.  Methods:   PC patients with bone metastases newly diagnosed with an SRE between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2014, were identified using MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases. Included patients were aged ≥40 years, had medical/pharmacy benefits for ≥12 months before (preindex) and ≥6 months after (postindex) diagnosis, and were without evidence of other primary cancers. Patients were categorized as nonusers of opioids (<10 days), short-term users (≥10 and <60 days), or long-term users (≥60 days) and further by SRE type. Opioid type, proportion of time on opioids, morphine-equivalent dose, adjuvant medications, and radiation use before and after SRE diagnosis were evaluated.  Findings:   A total of 1071 eligible patients were identified (mean age, 71 years; 10.8% had chronic pain at baseline). The most common SRE types present were radiation (60.2%), radiation and bone surgery (15.0%), pathologic fracture (7.2%), and bone surgery (6.5%). Opioid use increased from 49.9% preindex to 53.3% postindex (P < 0.0001). The proportion of time on opioids doubled after SRE (pre, 0.3 vs post, 0.6; P < 0.0001). A greater percentage of patients used only opioids after an SRE (pre, 11.0%; post, 46.1% [P < 0.0001]), while a lesser percentage of patients used only radiation after an SRE (pre, 36.0%; post, 4.7% [P < 0.0001]). An increase was observed in patients using neither radiation nor opioids (pre, 14.5%; post, 42.0% [P < 0.0001]). An increase of ~50% was noted in long-term opioid users (from 22.1% to 32.1%). The use of monotherapy with a short-acting opioid decreased (pre, 35.1%; post, 32.5% [P < 0.0001]), while use of mixed opioids increased (pre, 13.7%; post, 19.1% [P < 0.0001]). Mean morphine-equivalent dose increased from pre- to post-SRE (9.1 vs 13.1 mg). Bisphosphonate and NSAID users decreased from before to after an SRE diagnosis (bisphosphonates, 40.2% vs 8.6%; NSAIDs, 26.7% vs 17.5% [both, P < 0.0001]).  Implications:   Long-term opioid use and dose were significantly increased after SRE development in MPC. The high percentage of patients not treated with an opioid or radiation potentially supports the need for additional treatment options for controlling pain if medically necessary and/or to prevent SREs.""","""['Avin Yaldo', 'Lonnie Wen', 'Augustina Ogbonnaya', 'Adriana Valderrama', 'Jonathan Kish', 'Michael Eaddy', 'Charles Kreilick', 'Krishna Tangirala', 'Katarzyna Shields']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Ther""","""['Payer costs for inpatient treatment of pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression among patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis secondary to prostate or breast cancer.', 'Measurement of skeletal related events in SEER-Medicare: a comparison of claims-based methods.', 'The cost of treatment of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer.', 'Burden of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer: unmet need in pain improvement.', 'A systematic review of the role of bisphosphonates in metastatic disease.', 'Short- and Long-term Opioid Use in Patients with Oral and Oropharynx Cancer.']"""

The proposed scheme follows seed selection, region growing-merging and fusion of multiple image segments. In this process initially, an image is divided into a number of blocks and for each block we compute the phase component of the Fourier transform. The phase component of each block reflects the gray level variation among the block but contains a large correlation among them. Hence a singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is adhered to generate a singular value of each block. Then a thresholding procedure is applied on these singular values to identify edgy and smooth regions and some seed points are selected for segmentation. By considering each seed point we perform a binary segmentation of the complete MRI and hence with all seed points we get an equal number of binary images. A parcel based statistical fusion process is used to fuse all the binary images into multiple segments. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on identifying different abnormalities: prostatic carcinoma detection, tuberculous granulomas identification and intracranial neoplasm or brain tumor detection.

Although ERG rearrangement is less common in AA compared to EA PCa, the relative frequency of PTEN loss and the association of PTEN/ERG molecular subtypes with outcomes is unknown for AA PCa. We examined PTEN/ERG status by immunohistochemistry in self-identified AA patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins with tumor tissue available on tissue microarray (TMA; n=169) and matched these cases by pathologic parameters to 169 EA patients from the same TMAs.

Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.""","""['Nathan T Zwagerman', 'Michael M McDowell', 'Ronald L Hamilton', 'Edward A Monaco rd', 'John C Flickinger', 'Peter C Gerszten']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neurosurg Focus""","""['Pathological characteristics of spine metastases treated with high-dose single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.', 'Tumor pseudoprogression of spinal metastasis after radiosurgery: a novel concept and case reports.', 'Radiosurgery for benign tumors of the spine: clinical experience and current trends.', 'The use of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal axis tumors: a review.', 'Review of stereotactic radiosurgery for intradural spine tumors.', 'Pathological characteristics of spine metastases treated with high-dose single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.']"""

In this study, we discovered quite a new function of curcumin, i.e. pH-responsive endosomal disrupting activity, derived from curcumin's self-assembly. We selected anticancer activity as an example of biological activities of curcumin, and investigated the contribution of pH-responsive property to its anticancer activity. As a result, we demonstrated that the pH-responsive property significantly enhances the anticancer activity of curcumin. Furthermore, we demonstrated a utility of the pH-responsive property of curcumin as delivery nanocarriers for doxorubicin toward combination cancer therapy.

Acquisitions of diverse sets of hallmark capabilities along with an aberrant functioning of androgen receptor signaling are the central driving forces behind prostatic tumorigenesis and its transition into metastatic castration resistant disease. These hallmark capabilities arise due to an intense orchestration of several crucial factors, including deregulation of vital cell physiological processes, inactivation of tumor suppressive activity and disruption of prostate gland specific cellular homeostasis. The molecular complexity and redundancy of oncoproteins signaling in prostate cancer demands for concurrent inhibition of multiple hallmark associated pathways. By an extensive manual curation of the published biomedical literature, we have developed Human Prostate Cancer Hallmarks Map (HPCHM), an onco-functional atlas of human prostate cancer associated signaling and events. It explores molecular architecture of prostate cancer signaling at various levels, namely key protein components, molecular connectivity map, oncogenic signaling pathway map, pathway based functional connectivity map etc. Here, we briefly represent the systems level understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with prostate tumorigenesis by considering each and individual molecular and cell biological events of this disease process.""","""['Dipamoy Datta', 'Md Aftabuddin', 'Dinesh Kumar Gupta', 'Sanghamitra Raha', 'Prosenjit Sen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['An original patient-derived xenograft of prostate cancer with cyst formation.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: deciphering the origins and pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis and aggression.', 'Plumbagin elicits differential proteomic responses mainly involving cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways in human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells.', 'Recent progress in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting androgen receptor-coactivator binding in prostate cancer.', 'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.', 'Racial differences in prostate tumor microenvironment: implications for disparate clinical outcomes and potential opportunities.', 'Toxicoproteomics of Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid in Models of Prostatic Diseases.', 'Effects of Green Tea Catechins on Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention: The Role of the Gut Microbiome.', 'A Tale of Two Cancers: A Current Concise Overview of Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of novel prostate cancer genes in patients stratified by Gleason classification: Role of antitumoral genes.']"""

Flavonols are a major sub-class of flavonoids featuring a hydroxyl group at C-3. Certain natural flavonols, such as quercetin and fisetin, have been shown by in vitro cell-based and in vivo animal experiments to be potential anti-prostate cancer agents. However, the Achilles' heel of flavonols as drug candidates is their moderate potency and poor pharmacokinetic profiles. This study aims to explore the substitution effect of 3-OH in flavonols on the in vitro anti-proliferative potency against both androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive human prostate cancer cell lines. Our first lead flavonol (3',4'-dimethoxyflavonol), eight 3-O-alkyl-3',4'-dimethoxyflavonols, and six 3-O-aminoalkyl-3',4'-dimethoxyflavonols have been synthesized through aldol condensation and the Algar-Flynn-Oyamada (AFO) reaction. The WST-1 cell proliferation assay indicates (i) that all synthesized 3-O-alkyl-3',4'-dimethoxyflavonols and 3-O-aminoalkyl-3',4'-dimethoxyflavonols are more potent than the parent 3',4'-dimethoxyflavonol and the natural flavonol quercetin in suppressing prostate cancer cell proliferation; and (ii) that incorporation of a dibutylamino group to the 3-OH group through a three- to five-carbon linker leads to the optimal derivatives with up to 292-fold enhanced potency as compared with the parent flavonol. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the most potent derivative 22 can activate PC-3 cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induce PC-3 cell apoptosis. No inhibitory ability of 22 up to 50μM concentration was observed against PWR-1E normal human epithelial prostate cells, suggesting its in vitro safety profile. The results indicate that chemical modulation at 3-OH is a vital strategy to optimize flavonols as anti-prostate cancer agents.""","""['Xiang Li', 'Guanglin Chen', 'Xiaojie Zhang', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Shilong Zheng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['Structure-activity relationship and pharmacokinetic studies of 3-O-substitutedflavonols as anti-prostate cancer agents.', ""3-O-Substituted-3',4',5'-trimethoxyflavonols: Synthesis and cell-based evaluation as anti-prostate cancer agents."", 'Silibinin derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents: Synthesis and cell-based evaluations.', 'The role of quercetin, flavonols and flavones in modulating inflammatory cell function.', 'Bioavailability and health effects of dietary flavonols in man.', 'In-silico activity prediction and docking studies of some flavonol derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents based on Monte Carlo optimization.', 'Synthesis, inverse docking-assisted identification and in vitro biological characterization of Flavonol-based analogs of fisetin as c-Kit, CDK2 and mTOR inhibitors against melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.', 'Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators for Prostate Cancer Prevention.', 'Progress in Research on the Role of Flavonoids in Lung Cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.']"""

Methods and materials:   537 early breast cancer patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy after conservative surgery were enrolled from April 2009 to December 2014, in an Italian cancer institute. The dose was 42.4 Gy in 16 daily fractions, 2.65 Gy per fraction. The boost to the tumor bed was administered only in grade III breast cancer patients and in patients with close or positive margins. Acute and late toxicity were prospectively assessed during and after radiotherapy according to RTOG scale. The impact of patients clinical characteristics, performed treatments and dose inhomogeneities on the occurrence of an higher level of acute skin toxicity and late fibrosis has been evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   The mean age was 74 (range 46-91 yrs). 27% of patients received boost. 22% of cases (n = 119) received also chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 32 months. G1 and G2/G3 acute skin toxicity were 61.3% and 20.5% and G1 and G2/G3 late fibrosis 12.6% and 4.3% respectively. Chemotherapy (p = 0.04), diabetes (p = 0.04) and boost administration (p < 0.01) were found to be statistically significant on the occurrence of late fibrosis, but a multivariate analysis did not show any factors connected. The boost administration (p < 0.01), the breast volume (p = 0.05), dose inhomogeneities (p < 0.01) and boost volume (p = 0.04) were found to be statistically significant as concerns the occurrence of acute skin reaction at the univariate analysis, but only the boost administration (p = 0.02), at multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   The results of our study, according to the large randomized trials, confirmed that hypofractionated whole breast irradiation is safe, and only the boost administration seems to be an important predictor for toxicity.

New methods are needed to examine temporal trends in the incidence of clinically significant PCa and whether trends vary by race.  Objective:   To conduct an in-depth analysis of incidence trends in clinically significant PCa, defined as cases in which PCa was the underlying cause of death within 10 yr of diagnosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   We extracted incident PCa cases during the period 1975-2002 and associated causes of death and survival through 2012 from nine cancer registries in the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We applied joinpoint regression analysis to identify when significant changes in trends occurred and age-period-cohort models to examine longitudinal and cross-sectional trends in the incidence of fatal PCa.  Results and limitations:   Among 51 680 fatal PCa cases, incidence increased 1% per year prior to 1992, declined 15% per year from 1992 to 1995, and further declined by 5% per year through 2002. Age-specific incidence rates of fatal disease decreased >2% per year among men aged ≥60 yr, yet rates remained relatively stable among men aged ≤55 yr. Fatal disease rates were >2-fold higher in black men compared with white men, a racial disparity that increased to 4.2-fold among younger men.  Conclusions:   The incidence of fatal PCa substantially declined after widespread PSA screening and treatment advances. Nevertheless, rates of fatal disease among younger men have remained relatively stable, suggesting the need for additional attention to early onset PCa, especially among black men. The persistent black-to-white racial disparity observed in fatal PCa underscores the need for greater understanding of the causes of this difference so that strategies can be implemented to eliminate racial disparities.  Patient summary:   We assessed how the incidence of ultimately fatal prostate cancer (PCa) changed over time. We found that the incidence of fatal PCa declined by >50% since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen testing and advances in treatment options; however, incidence rates among younger men remained relatively stable, and younger black men exhibited a 4.2-fold higher risk for fatal disease compared with white men.""","""['Scott P Kelly', 'Philip S Rosenberg', 'William F Anderson', 'Gabriella Andreotti', 'Naji Younes', 'Sean D Cleary', 'Michael B Cook']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Lead Time, Like Trains and Tides, Stops for No One.', 'Re: Scott P.

In this study, based on different PCa cell lines and knockout mice, we showed that PROX1 could be suppressed by DAB2IP, a novel member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein family and a critical player in control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and PCa metastasis. Mechanistically, PROX1 overexpression in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells could enhance the accumulation of HIF1α protein by inhibiting ubiquitin pathway and then consequently induce an EMT response, which is characterized by repression of E-cadherin, up-regulation of vimentin and matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and enhancement of cell migration.

In particular, the prognostic significance of salvage radiotherapy delivered before a current definition of biochemical recurrence, i.e. ultra-early salvage radiotherapy, is unclear.  Methods:   We reviewed 76 patients with pT2-3N0M0 prostate cancer who underwent salvage radiotherapy for post-prostatectomy biochemical recurrence at the following three timings: ultra-early salvage radiotherapy (n = 20) delivered before meeting a current definition of biochemical recurrence (two consecutive prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values ≥0.2 ng/mL); early salvage radiotherapy (n = 40) delivered after meeting the definition but before PSA reached 0.5 ng/mL; and delayed salvage radiotherapy (n = 16) delivered after PSA reached 0.5 ng/mL. The primary endpoint was failure of salvage radiotherapy, defined as a PSA value ≥0.2 ng/mL. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.  Results:   During the follow-up period (median: 70 months), four of 20 (20 %), nine of 40 (23 %) and seven of 16 (44 %) patients failed biochemically in the ultra-early, early and delayed salvage radiotherapy groups, respectively. On univariate analyses, the outcome of delayed salvage radiotherapy was worse than the others, while there was no significant difference between ultra-early and early groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the presence of Gleason pattern 5, perineural invasion and delayed salvage radiotherapy as independent predictors of poorer survival.  Conclusions:   No survival benefit of ultra-early salvage radiotherapy was demonstrated, whereas delayed salvage radiotherapy was associated with worse outcome as reported in previous studies.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed health related quality of life outcomes in 482 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution from 2010 to 2014. EPIC-CP was administered and interpreted in routine clinical practice without research personnel. We compared practitioner documented rates of incontinence pad use and functional erections to patient reported rates using EPIC-CP.  Results:   A total of 708 EPIC-CP questionnaires were completed. Mean urinary incontinence domain scores were significantly higher (worse) than baseline (mean ± SD 0.6 ± 0.2) 3 and 6 months after treatment (mean 3.1 ± 2.3 and 2.2 ± 2.1, respectively, each p <0.05) but they returned to baseline at 12 months (mean 1.6 ± 1.7, p >0.05). Mean sexual domain scores were significantly worse than baseline (mean 2.4 ± 2.8) at all posttreatment time points (each p <0.05).

Methods and materials:   Fourteen patients with presumed exclusive local recurrence after primary EBRT with or without BT were considered eligible for reirradiation. The median normalized total dose in 2-Gy fractions (NTD2Gy, α/β ratio = 1.5 Gy) was 74 Gy (range, 66-98.4 Gy) at first irradiation. Median time between the first irradiation and the reirradiation was 6.1 years (range, 4.7-10.2 years).  Results:   Between 2003 and 2008 salvage treatment was delivered with a median NTD2Gy of 85.1 Gy (range, 70-93.4) to the prostate with EBRT with (n=10) or without (n=4) BT. Androgen deprivation was given to 12 patients (median time of 12 months). No grade ≥3 toxicity was observed during and within 6 weeks after RT.

Methods and materials:   Patients with intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer were treated with conformal RT and short-course androgen deprivation. Both the prostate and the entire seminal vesicles were treated to 80 Gy in 40 fractions over 8 weeks (CFRT) or 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 5 weeks (MHRT). The endpoint of the present study was the development of any episode or grade of macroscopic hematuria. The median follow-up period was 93 months (range 6-143).  Results:   Macroscopic hematuria was reported by 25 of 168 patients (14.9%). The actuarial estimate of hematuria at 8 years was 17.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7%-23.3%). The number of patients with hematuria was 6 and 19 in the CFRT and MHRT arms, respectively, for an actuarial 8-year estimate of 9.7% and 24.3%, respectively (hazard ratio 3.468, 95% CI 1.385-8.684; P=.008). Overall, 8 of 25 patients were found to have biopsy-proven urothelial carcinoma (3 in the CFRT arm and 5 in the MHRT arm; P=.27). Thus, the 8-year actuarial incidence of macroscopic hematuria (after censoring urothelial cancer-related episodes) was 4.1% and 18.2% after CFRT and MHRT, respectively (hazard ratio 4.961, 95% CI 1.426-17.263; P=.012).

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare data with the Australian population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the actuarial second malignancy and pelvic malignancy rates and the death from SPC and from any cause.  Results:   A total of 889 patients were followed up for a median of 4.16 (0-13) years with 370 (42%) patients having ≥5 years of followup.

We report on the development, testing and application of a promising new approach to repositioning.  Methods:   Our approach is based on mining a human functional linkage network for inversely correlated modules of drug and disease gene targets. The method takes account of multiple information sources, including gene mutation, gene expression, and functional connectivity and proximity of within module genes.  Results:   The method was used to identify candidates for treating breast and prostate cancer. We found that (i) the recall rate for FDA approved drugs for breast (prostate) cancer is 20/20 (10/11), while the rates for drugs in clinical trials were 131/154 and 82/106; (ii) the ROC/AUC performance substantially exceeds that of comparable methods; (iii) preliminary in vitro studies indicate that 5/5 candidates have therapeutic indices superior to that of Doxorubicin in MCF7 and SUM149 cancer cell lines. We briefly discuss the biological plausibility of the candidates at a molecular level in the context of the biological processes that they mediate.  Conclusions:   Our method appears to offer promise for the identification of multi-targeted drug candidates that can correct aberrant cellular functions. In particular the computational performance exceeded that of other CMap-based methods, and in vitro experiments indicate that 5/5 candidates have therapeutic indices superior to that of Doxorubicin in MCF7 and SUM149 cancer cell lines.

Materials and methods:   We searched our RP database to indentify cases of GS ≤7 prostate cancer with simultaneous pelvic LN dissection (PLND) in the period between 2005 and 2014. Since 2005, we have graded all glomeruloid and cribriform cancer as Gleason pattern 4 and have graded mucinous adenocarcinoma based on the underlying architectural pattern, consistent with the 2014 modified Gleason grading system. All RPs were embedded in entirety, including the PLND. A total of 7 442 cases were identified, of which 73 had at least one positive LN (+LN).  Results:   The incidence rates for regional LN metastases at RP for 3 + 3 = 6 (GG1), 3 + 4 = 7 (GG2), 3 + 4 = 7 (GG2) with T5, 4 + 3 = 7 (GG3) and 4 + 3 = 7 (GG3) with T5 were 0, 0.6, 0.4, 4.3 and 6.3%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in risk of +LNs at RP between the grade groups, as defined by the novel GG system. There was no statistically significant difference in risk of +LNs at RP for men with 3 + 4 (GG2) vs 3 + 4 (GG2) with T5 and for men with 4 + 3 (GG3) vs 4 + 3 (GG3) with T5. Non-pelvic LN involvement was identified in 0.2% of all RP cases. Two patients with GS 3 + 4 = 7 with <5% pattern 4 experienced LN metastases.  Conclusion:   This study supports our previous finding that men with GS 6 (GG1) at RP have no risk of LN metastases. These findings also support the 2014 revisions to the Gleason grading system where 3 + 3 with T4 (2005 modified grading system) is now considered 3 + 4 (GG2), with a comment on percent pattern 4, because <5% pattern 4 increases the risk of LN metastases. It also supports keeping 3 + 4 (GG2) with T5 (<5% pattern 5) and 4 + 3 (GG3) with T5 with their respective grade groups, with a notation of T5 because the <5% higher grade component did not increase the risk of LN metastases within a given GG. Our findings highlight that 3 + 4 (GG2) and 4 + 3 (GG3), even with a 5% higher grade component, are distinct groups with respect to LN metastases and should not be combined under the umbrella designation of GS 7 as is often the case in the literature with the Gleason grading system.""","""['Mairo L Diolombi', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prevalence of adverse pathology features in grade group 2 prostatectomy specimens with syn- or metachronous metastatic disease.', 'PIN-like (Ductal) Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Do adenocarcinomas of the prostate with Gleason score (GS) ≤6 have the potential to metastasize to lymph nodes?', 'Variance of Tumor Grade at Radical Prostatectomy With Assessment of Each Tumor Nodule Versus Global Grading.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Single center analysis of an advisable control interval for follow-up of patients with PI-RADS category 3 in multiparametric MRI of the prostate.', 'Risk Factors for Pathologically Confirmed Lymph Nodes Metastasis in Patients With Clinical T2N0M0 Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Practice Patterns in Reporting Tertiary Grades at Radical Prostatectomy: Survey of a Large Group of Experienced Urologic Pathologists.', 'Contemporary grading of prostate cancer: 2017 update for pathologists and clinicians.', 'Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Conclusions:   Increased prostate-specific antigen serum concentrations without a diagnosis of prostate cancer in histopathologic examinations should not be an independent contraindication for performing organ transplantation.

Methods and materials:   We identified 222,804 patients diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, or high-risk N0M0 prostate cancer and treated with local therapy (surgery or radiation alone, with or without hormone therapy) using the National Cancer Database. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine whether the choice of radiation therapy vs radical prostatectomy varied by distance among patients living in rural and urban areas. Analyses were adjusted for geographic location within the United States, age, race, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, year of diagnosis, income quartile, education quartile, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and T stage.  Results:   Patients living in urban or rural areas were less likely to receive radiation compared with surgery if they lived farther from the treatment facility. Among urban patients living ≤5 miles from the treatment facility, 53.3% received radiation, compared with 47.0%, 43.6%, and 33.8% of those living 5 to 10, 10 to 15, or >15 miles away, respectively (P<.001 in all cases). Similarly, rural patients were less likely to receive radiation the farther they lived from the treatment facility (≤25 miles: 62.3%; 25-50 miles: 55.5%; 50-75 miles: 38.4%; >75 miles: 23.8%; P<.05 in all cases). These trends were also present when each risk group was analyzed separately.  Conclusion:   Patients with prostate cancer in both urban and rural settings were less likely to receive radiation therapy rather than surgery the farther away they lived from a treatment center.

Methods:   We identified Medicare and private payer patients undergoing RP from 2012 to 2014 from the claims-based registry maintained by the Michigan Value Collaborative, a statewide consortium that provides hospitals with price-standardized and risk-adjusted 90-day episode costs for common medical and surgical procedures. We divided hospitals into quartiles based on mean total episode cost for RP. Total episode costs were further classified into 4 payment categories: index hospitalization, professional services, readmissions, and postacute care. Component payments were then compared across high-cost and low-cost hospitals.  Results:   We identified 3077 patients undergoing RP in 42 hospitals. Mean 90-day total episode cost was $14,614, ranging from $13,043 to $16,749 across quartiles (28.4% difference, P < .001). Overall variation in total episode cost was divided nearly equally among readmissions (29%), postacute care (29%), and professional payments (26%).

To enhance its efficacy, we designed a novel series of twenty-four monocarbonyl curcumin analogue-1,2,3-triazole conjugates and evaluated their anti-cancer activity towards endocrine related cancers. The new compounds (17-40) were synthesized through CuAAC click reaction and SAR analysis carried out. Out of these all, compound 17 showed most significant anti-cancer activity against prostate cancer cells with IC50 values of 8.8μM and 9.5μM in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, respectively. Another compound 26 showed significant anti-cancer activity against breast cancer cells with IC50 of 6μM, 10μM and 6.4μM in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells, respectively while maintaining low toxicity towards non-cancer originated cell line, HEK-293. Compounds 17 and 26 arrested cell cycle and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Further, both of these compounds significantly down-regulated cell proliferation marker (PCNA), inhibited activation of cell survival protein (Akt phosphorylation), upregulated pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and down-regulated anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in their respective cell lines. In addition, in vitro stability, solubility and plasma binding studies of the compounds 17 and 26 showed them to be metabolically stable.

The aim of this study was to describe annual trends in clinical and treatment characteristics, and changes in surveillance practice within a large combined cohort of men with PCa in South Australia (SA) and Victoria, Australia in 2008-2013.  Methods:   Common data items from clinical registries in SA and Victoria were merged to develop a cross-jurisdictional dataset consisting of 13,598 men with PCa. Frequencies were used to describe these variables using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk of disease progression categories in 10 year age groups. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of a number of factors (both individually and together) on the likelihood of men receiving no active treatment within twelve months of the diagnosis (i.e. managed with active surveillance/watchful waiting).  Results:   Trend analysis showed that over time: (1) men in SA and Victoria are being diagnosed at older age in 2013, 66.1 (SD = 9.7) years compared to 2009 (64.5 (SD = 9.7)); (2) diagnostic methods and characteristics have changed with time; and (3) types of the treatments have changed, with more men having no active treatment. The majority of men were diagnosed with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) <10 ng/mL (66 %) and Grade Group < 4 (65 %). Nearly seventy percent received radical treatment within 12 months of diagnosis, while ~20 % had no active treatment. In 14 % of cases treatment was not recorded or had not commenced. Having no active treatment was strongly associated older age, lower PSA and lower Grade Group at diagnosis, and in 2013 it was offered more frequently (more than 3 times) than in 2009 (OR = 2.63, 95 % CI: 2.16-3.22).  Conclusions:   Findings of this study provide the first cross-jurisdictional description of PCa characteristics and management in Australia. These findings will provide benchmarking for ongoing monitoring and feedback of disease management and outcomes of PCa through the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Australia New Zealand to improve evidence-based practice.""","""['Rasa Ruseckaite', 'Kerri Beckmann', ""Michael O'Callaghan"", 'David Roder', 'Kim Moretti', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Sue Evans']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Development of South Australian-Victorian Prostate Cancer Health Outcomes Research Dataset.', 'The current use of active surveillance in an Australian cohort of men: a pattern of care analysis from the Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Patterns of care for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Victoria from 2008 to 2011.', 'Prostate Cancer Registries: Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Updated trends in imaging use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.', 'Why do men with prostate cancer discontinue active surveillance for definitive treatment?

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an inducer of EMT in epithelial cells and is obligatory for acquiring invasive phenotype in carcinoma. TGF-β plays a vital role in metastasis and tumorigenesis in prostate cancer, and mutations in the components of Wnt signaling pathways are associated with various kinds of cancers including prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify alterations in Wnt signaling pathway components involved during prostate cancer progression and to determine the effect of quercetin on TGF-β-induced EMT in prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line. The expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers and the components of Wnt signaling pathway were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. It was observed that quercetin prevented TGF-β-induced expression of vimentin and N-cadherin and increased the expression of E-cadherin in PC-3 cells, thus preventing TGF-β-induced EMT. Furthermore, the relative expression of Twist, Snail, and Slug showed that quercetin significantly decreased TGF-β-induced expression of Twist, Snail, and Slug. In the present study, the expression of epithelial markers were found to be upregulated in naive state and downregulated in induced state whereas the mesenchymal markers were found to be downregulated in naive state and upregulated in induced state.

Here, we investigated the relationship between TCM use and the survival of prostate cancer patients.A retrospective nationwide cohort study of prostate cancer patients was conducted between 1998 and 2003 using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were classified as TCM users or nonusers, and monitored from the day of prostate cancer diagnosis to death or end of 2012.

First, we modeled the spiked-in data set where differentially expressed genes were known and spiked-in at different known concentrations, showing that the precisions established by different gene ranking methods were higher than working with raw data. The results obtained from the spiked-in experiment were extrapolated to the CF data set to run learning and blind validation. RMA and MAS5 provided different sets of discriminatory genes that have a higher predictive accuracy in the learning phase, but lower predictive accuracy during the blind validation phase, suggesting that the genetic signatures generated using both preprocessing techniques cannot be generalizable. The pathways found using the raw data set better described what is a priori known for the CF disease. Besides, RMA produced more reliable pathways than MAS5. Understanding the strengths of these two preprocessing techniques in phenotype prediction is critical for precision medicine. Particularly, this article concludes that biological pathways might be better unraveled working with raw expression data. Moreover, the interpretation of the predictive gene profiles generated by RMA and MAS5 should be done with caution.

From 2002 to 2006, 20 patients who showed PSA failure after first-line hormonal therapy with a luteinizing hormone-release hormone (LH-RH) agonist and BCL were enrolled. All patients were immediately switched from BCL to FLT, administered with an LH-RH agonist, as second-line combined androgen blockade (CAB). We evaluated the PSA response to second-line CAB. Eight patients (40%) were responsive, showing PSA decreases of at least 50%. The median (range) duration of the PSA response was 18.4 (3-26) months. Second-line CAB using FLT was effective in 40% of patients who received first-line CAB using BCL. The lower Gleason scores at the initial prostate biopsy probably reflect the response to second-line CAB. Responders showed significantly better OS and CSS in the determination of any PSA decline and 40% PSA decline.

Results:   NeoBOMB1 and natGa-, natIn-, and natLu-NeoBOMB1 bound to GRPR with high affinity (half maximal inhibitory concentration, 1-2 nM). 67Ga-, 111In-, and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1 specifically and strongly bound on the cell membrane of PC-3 cells displaying low internalization, as expected for receptor antagonists. They showed excellent metabolic stability in peripheral mouse blood (>95% intact at 5 min after injection). After injection in mice, all 3 (67Ga-, 111In-, and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1) showed comparably high and GRPR-specific uptake in the PC-3 xenografts (e.g., 30.6 ± 3.9, 28.6 ± 6.0, and >35 percentage injected dose per gram at 4 h after injection, respectively), clearing from background predominantly via the kidneys. During a translational study in prostate cancer patients, 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 rapidly localized in pathologic lesions, achieving high-contrast imaging.  Conclusion:   The GRPR antagonist radioligands 67Ga-, 111In-, and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1, independent of the radiometal applied, have shown comparable behavior in prostate cancer models, in favor of future theranostic use in GRPR-positive cancer patients. Such translational prospects were further supported by the successful visualization of prostate cancer lesions in men using 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and PET/CT.""","""['Berthold A Nock', 'Aikaterini Kaloudi', 'Emmanouil Lymperis', 'Athina Giarika', 'Harshad R Kulkarni', 'Ingo Klette', 'Aviral Singh', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Marion de Jong', 'Theodosia Maina', 'Richard P Baum']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga/177Lu-NeoBOMB1, a Novel Radiolabeled GRPR Antagonist for Theranostic Use in Oncology.', 'Preclinical and first clinical experience with the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-antagonist ⁶⁸GaSB3 and PET/CT.', 'Preclinical comparison of Al18F- and 68Ga-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonists for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', 'Peptide Radioligands in Cancer Theranostics: Agonists and Antagonists.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'An Overview of In Vitro Assays of 64Cu-, 68Ga-, 125I-, and 99mTc-Labelled Radiopharmaceuticals Using Radiometric Counters in the Era of Radiotheranostics.', '68Ga-Labeled Thz14Bombesin(7-14) Analogs: Promising GRPR-Targeting Agonist PET Tracers with Low Pancreas Uptake.', 'Targeting the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRP-R) in Cancer Therapy: Development of Bombesin-Based Peptide-Drug Conjugates.']"""

This study was conducted to investigate the doses received by the different pelvic nodal regions with varying techniques used for prostate radiotherapy.  Methods and materials:   Twenty patients of high-risk node-negative prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate alone were studied. Replanning was done for intensity-modulated radiotherapy, 3-dimensional conformal treatment, and 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy with additional delineation of the pelvic nodal regions, namely, common iliac (upper and lower), presacral, internal iliac, obturator, and external iliac. Dose-volume parameters such as Dmean, D100%, D66%, D33%, V40, and V50 to each of the nodal regions were estimated for all patients.  Results:   The obturator nodes received the highest dose among all nodal regions. The mean dose received by obturator nodal region was 44, 29, and 22 Gy from 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy, 3-dimensional conformal treatment, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, respectively. The mean dose was significantly higher when compared between 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy and 3-dimensional conformal treatment ( P < .001), 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( P < .001), and 3-dimensional conformal treatment and intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( P < .001). The D33% of the obturator region was 64, 39, and 37 Gy from 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy, 3-dimensional conformal treatment, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, respectively. The dose received by all other pelvic nodal regions was low and not clinically relevant.  Conclusion:   The incidental dose received by obturator regions is significant especially with 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy and 3-dimensional conformal treatment techniques as used in the trials studying elective pelvic nodal irradiation. However, with intensity-modulated radiotherapy, this dose is lower, making elective pelvic irradiation more relevant. Advances in Knowledge: This study highlights that incidental dose received by obturator regions is significant especially with 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy and 3-dimensional conformal treatment techniques.""","""['Vedang Murthy', 'Shirley Lewis', 'Mayur Sawant', 'Siji N Paul', 'Umesh Mahantshetty', 'Shyam Kishore Shrivastava']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Incidental Dose to Pelvic Nodes in Bladder-Only Radiotherapy: Is It Clinically Relevant?', 'Pelvic nodal dose escalation with prostate hypofractionation using conformal avoidance defined (H-CAD) intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy improves lymph node coverage and dose to critical structures compared with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic nodal radiotherapy in patients with unfavorable intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer: evidence, rationale, and future directions.', 'Australasian Gastrointestinal Trials Group (AGITG) contouring atlas and planning guidelines for intensity-modulated radiotherapy in anal cancer.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.', 'Dosimetric and Hematologic Implications of Prostate-Only Versus Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy: Results of the Multicentric Phase 3 PROPER Study.']"""

Aberrant AR function becomes a risk factor for promoting the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we examined the roles of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) and ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in regulating AR expression and activity and growth properties in PCa cells. Compared with normal prostate tissues, PCa tumors exhibited high levels of PYK2 and S6K1 expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of PYK2 and S6K1 were significantly correlated with nuclear AR expression in PCa tissues. We further found the association between PYK2, S6K1, and AR in their protein expression and phosphorylation levels among normal prostate PZ-HPV-7 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Overexpression of the wild-type PYK2 in PZ-HPV-7 and LNCaP cells promoted AR and S6K1 expression and phosphorylation as well as enhanced cell growth. In contrast, expression of the mutated PYK2 or knockdown of PYK2 expression in LNCaP or 22Rv1 cells caused reduced expression or phosphorylation of AR and S6K1 as well as retarded cell growth. Under an androgen-deprived condition, PYK2-promoted AR expression and phosphorylation and PSA production in LNCaP cells can be abolished by knocking down S6K1 expression. In summary, our data suggested that PYK2 via S6K1 activation modulated AR function and growth properties in PCa cells. Thus, PYK2 and S6K1 may potentially serve as therapeutic targets for PCa treatment.""","""['Yu-Hsuan Hsiao', 'Yu-Ting Huang', 'Chia-Yu Hung', 'Tzu-Chien Kuo', 'Fuh-Jinn Luo', 'Ta-Chun Yuan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'ErbB-2 via PYK2 upregulates the adhesive ability of androgen receptor-positive human prostate cancer cells.', 'Isosilybin B causes androgen receptor degradation in human prostate carcinoma cells via PI3K-Akt-Mdm2-mediated pathway.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'The role of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase family in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance.', 'A novel biguanide derivative, IM176, induces prostate cancer cell death by modulating the AMPK-mTOR and androgen receptor signaling pathways.', 'Activated PyK2 and Its Associated Molecules Transduce Cellular Signaling from the Cancerous Milieu for Cancer Metastasis.', 'Reciprocal regulation of CIP2A and AR expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'ACK1 upregulated the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells by promoting p27 phosphorylation and degradation.', 'Pyk2 level is a novel prognostic marker for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after radical surgery.']"""

This study aimed to develop and characterise a 3D in vitro co-culture model to simulate prostate cancer bone metastasis and to assess the ability of the model to investigate nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery and gene knockdown. PC3 or LNCaP prostate cancer cells were co-cultured with hFOB 1.19 osteoblast cells in 2D on plastic tissue culture plates and in 3D on collagen scaffolds mimicking the bone microenvironment. To characterise the co-culture model, cell proliferation, enzyme secretion and the utility of two different gene delivery vectors to mediate siRNA uptake and gene knockdown were assessed. Cell proliferation was reduced by∼50% by day 7 in the co-culture system relative to monoculture (PC3 and LNCaP co-cultures, in 2D and 3D) and an enhanced level of MMP9 (a marker of bone metastasis) was secreted into the media (1.2-4-fold increase depending on the co-culture system). A cationic cyclodextrin gene delivery vector proved significantly less toxic in the co-culture system relative to the commercially available vector Lipofectamine 2000(®). In addition, knockdown of both the GAPDH gene (minimum 15%) and RelA subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor (minimum 20%) was achieved in 2D and 3D cell co-cultures. Results indicate that the prostate cancer-osteoblast in vitro co-culture model was more physiologically relevant vs the monoculture.

We sought to explore how well-informed members of the public allocate responsibilities in prostate-specific antigen screening decision-making. In 2014, we convened two Community juries in Sydney, Australia, to address questions related to the content and timing of information provision and respective roles of patients and general practitioners in screening decisions. Participants in the first jury were of mixed gender and of all ages (n = 15); the participants in the second jury were all male and of screening age (n = 12). Both juries were presented with balanced factual evidence on the harms and benefits of prostate-specific antigen screening and expert perspectives on ethico-legal aspects of consent in medical practice. In their deliberations, jurors agreed that general practitioners should take responsibility for informing men of the options, risks and benefits of prostate-specific antigen testing, but arrived at different positions on whether or not general practitioners should also guide screening decisions. Jurors also disagreed on how much and when general practitioners should provide detailed information about biopsies and treatments. These responses suggest that for prostate-specific antigen testing, there is a public expectation that both the allocation of responsibility between general practitioners and their male patients, and the level of information provided will be tailored to individual men.

Methods:   Fifty-six histopathological whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens from ten randomly selected patients with prostate cancer (PC) were matched with corresponding transverse mpMRI slices. The mpMRI was performed prior to biopsy and consisted of T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).  Results:   In each prostate specimen, a wide range of histopathological conditions were observed. They showed consistent but overlapping characteristics on mpMRI. Normal glands in the transition zone showed lower signal intensity (SI) on T2-WI, lower ADC values and lower citrate peaks on MRSI as compared to the peripheral zone (PZ) due to sparser glandular elements and more prominent collagenous fibres. In the PZ, normal glands were iso-intense on T2-WI, while high SI areas represented cystic atrophy. Mimickers of well-differentiated PC on mpMRI were inflammation, adenosis, HG-PIN and post-atrophic hyperplasia.  Conclusion:   Each prostate is a unique mix of normal, benign and/or malignant areas that vary in extent and distribution resulting in very heterogeneous characteristics on mpMRI. Understanding the main concepts of this mpMRI-histopathological correlation may increase the diagnostic confidence in reporting mpMRI.  Keypoints:   • In each prostate specimen a wide range of histopathological conditions was observed. • Interpretation of mpMRI may be difficult because benign conditions may mimic PC. • High signal intensity areas in the PZ on T2-WI represented cystic atrophy. • The TZ showed sparser glands and more collagenous fibres than the PZ.""","""['Pieter J L De Visschere', 'Anne Vral', 'Gianpaolo Perletti', 'Eva Pattyn', 'Marleen Praet', 'Vittorio Magri', 'Geert M Villeirs']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI Features and Pathologic Outcome of Wedge-Shaped Lesions in the Peripheral Zone on T2-Weighted Images of the Prostate.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for transition zone prostate cancer: essential findings, limitations, and future directions.', 'Prostate MR: pitfalls and benign lesions.', 'PI-RADS-Based Segmented Threshold of PSMA-PET SUVmax Is Better than Traditional Fixed Threshold for Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Especially for PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'Prostate imaging-reporting and data system version 2 in combination with clinical parameters for prostate cancer detection: a single center experience.', 'Development and validation of a predictive model for diagnosing prostate cancer after transperineal prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging appearance of diffuse adenosis of the peripheral zone (DAPZ).', 'Simplified PI-RADS (S-PI-RADS) for biparametric MRI to detect and manage prostate cancer: What urologists need to know.']"""

S6K is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and is correlated to poor prognosis in prostate cancer. Due to the current urgency to identify factors involved in prostate cancer progression, we aimed to reveal the cellular functions of three S6K isoforms-p70-S6K1, p85-S6K1 and p54-S6K2-in prostate cancer, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets.  Methods:   In this study we performed S6K knockdown and overexpression and investigated its role in prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, viability, migration and resistance to docetaxel treatment. In addition, we measured tumor growth in Nude mice injected with PC3 cells overexpressing S6K isoforms and tested the efficacy of a new available S6K1 inhibitor in vitro.  Results:   S6Ks overexpression enhanced PC3-luc cell line viability, migration, resistance to docetaxel and tumor formation in Nude mice. Only S6K2 knockdown rendered prostate cancer cells more sensitive to docetaxel. S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 was particularly effective for reducing migration and proliferation of PC3 cell line.  Conclusions:   These findings demonstrate that S6Ks play an important role in prostate cancer progression, enhancing cell viability, migration and chemotherapy resistance, and place both S6K1 and S6K2 as a potential targets in advanced prostate cancer.

Methods:   This retrospective, observational study evaluated adult male patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 185) in the EMR database between July 1, 2011, and March 31, 2014, who had initiated first-line treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2014. The first record for a patient initiating abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide was the index date. Patients had 6 months of pre-index medical record history and a variable length follow-up period, extending from the index date to the end of medical record data availability or date of the end of the study (March 31, 2014). The sequence of first- and second-line therapies for advanced prostate cancer therapy was reported.  Findings:   A total of 809 patients met study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This study found that the majority of patients who initiated treatment with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2014, received a single line of therapy (72%); abiraterone acetate was the most common first-line treatment (74% of first-line patients). A subset of patients treated first-line with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide were transitioned to an oral second-line agent (17% of first-line abiraterone acetate-treated patients transitioned to second-line enzalutamide, and 16% of first-line enzalutamide-treated patients transitioned to second-line abiraterone acetate). Chemotherapy with docetaxel was also a commonly observed second-line treatment selection, occurring in 8% of first-line abiraterone acetate-treated patients and in 7% of first-line enzalutamide-treated patients.

In this way, these patients' quality of life (QOL) were improved and time to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was delayed, even some patients were clinically cured. There are lack of effective medicines and methods for CRPC patients. Greatly tonifying original qi is mainly used for improving their clinical symptoms and prolonging survivals. Practice has proved staging based strategies and practice of IM has favorable advantages in treating prostate cancer, especially showing prospect in prolonging survival and postponing progression of advanced prostate cancer patients.

This study assessed the impact that race had on the risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) among men definitively treated for favorable-risk prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Between 1997 and 2013, 7252 men with low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk PC were treated with brachytherapy with neoadjuvant ADT (n = 1501) or without neoadjuvant ADT (n = 5751) for a 4-month median duration. Cox and Fine-Gray multivariate regressions were used to analyze whether the risk of ACM and OCM increased among AA men versus non-AA men receiving ADT; adjustments were made for the age at brachytherapy, year of brachytherapy, cardiometabolic comorbidity status, risk group, and ADT treatment propensity score.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 8.04 years, 869 men (12.0%) died: 48 (5.52%) of PC and 821 (94.48%) of other causes. There was a significant association between AA race and an increased risk of both ACM (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.94; P = .028) and OCM (AHR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.08-3.19; P = .024) among AA men versus non-AA men who received ADT but not among those who did not receive ADT (AHR for ACM, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.93-1.91; P = .12; AHR for OCM, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.96-2.02; P = .08).  Conclusions:   ADT use may shorten survival in AA men with favorable-risk PC; therefore, its reservation for the treatment of higher risk PC, for which level 1 evidence supports its use, should be considered.

The associations between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and prostate cancer risk have been inconsistent. Using Mendelian randomisation, we evaluated associations between PUFAs and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We used individual-level data from a consortium of 22 721 cases and 23 034 controls of European ancestry. Externally-weighted PUFA-specific polygenic risk scores (wPRSs), with explanatory variation ranging from 0.65 to 33.07%, were constructed and used to evaluate associations with prostate cancer risk per one standard deviation (s.d.) increase in genetically-predicted plasma PUFA levels using multivariable-adjusted unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   No overall association was observed between the genetically-predicted PUFAs evaluated in this study and prostate cancer risk. However, risk reductions were observed for short-chain PUFAs, linoleic (ORLA=0.95, 95%CI=0.92, 0.98) and α-linolenic acids (ORALA=0.96, 95%CI=0.93, 0.98), among men <62 years; whereas increased risk was found among men ⩾62 years for LA (ORLA=1.04, 95%CI=1.01, 1.07).

The abundance of selected miRNAs was analysed in urine specimens from two independent cohorts of patients with PCa (N=215 overall), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; N=23), and asymptomatic controls (ASC; N=62) by means of quantitative reverse transcription PCR.  Results:   Over 100 miRNAs were found deregulated in PCa as compared with non-cancerous prostate tissue. After thorough validation, four miRNAs were selected for the analysis in urine specimens.

Experimental design:   RNA levels of AR-V7 and PSA in peripheral blood collected before treatment were quantified using droplet digital-PCR in retrospective cohorts treated with abiraterone acetate (N = 81) or enzalutamide (N = 51) for CRPC. Multivariable Cox regression adjusted for known prognostic factors was used for analyses.  Results:   PSA transcripts were detected in 57% of abiraterone acetate-treated patients and in 63% of enzalutamide-treated patients. PSA-positive patients had a shorter TTF than PSA-negative patients [adjusted HR = 2.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-4.10) and 2.60 (95% CI, 1.19-5.69); P = 0.006 and 0.017 in abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide cohorts, respectively]. Patients with a higher-AR-V7 transcript level had a shorter TTF with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide in univariate analysis (median 8.0 months vs. 15.6 months, P = 0.046 in abiraterone acetate-cohort and 3.6 months vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.050 in enzalutamide cohort). In multivariable models, the association with TTF remained significant in the enzalutamide cohort (adjusted HR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.01-4.05; P = 0.048), but statistically insignificant in the abiraterone acetate cohort. In both cohorts, we observed potential prognostic value of both PSA and AR-V7 RNA expression on OS; patients with detectable PSA transcripts and high AR-V7 predicted the poorest OS.  Conclusions:   PSA and AR-V7 transcripts in blood potentially serve as biomarkers predicting TTF and OS with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment.

We included all non-metastatic cases from 1998 to 2013 referred for urinary/prostatic symptoms or elevated PSA level. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to identify characteristics associated with symptomatic presentation and compare treatments according to reason for referral. Outcomes (i.e. overall survival, PCa-specific survival, metastasis-free survival and disease-free survival) were compared using multivariate Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression.  Results:   Our analytical cohort consisted of 4 841 men with localized PCa. Symptomatic men had lower-risk disease (incidence ratio [IR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.81 for high vs low risk), fewer radical prostatectomies (IR 0.64, CI: 0.56-0.75) and less radiotherapy (IR 0.86, CI: 0.77-0.96) than men presenting with elevated PSA level. All-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, CI: 1.16-1.47), disease-specific mortality (HR 1.42, CI: 1.13-1.77) and risk of metastases (HR 1.36, CI: 1.13-1.64) were higher for men presenting with symptoms, after adjustment for other clinical characteristics; however, risk of disease progression did not differ (HR 0.90, CI: 0.74-1.07) amongst those treated curatively. Subgroup analyses indicated poorer PCa survival for symptomatic referral among men undergoing radical prostatectomy (HR 3.4, CI: 1.3-8.8), those aged >70 years (HR 1.4, CI: 1.0-1.8), men receiving private treatment (HR 2.1, CI: 1.3-3.3), those diagnosed via biopsy (HR 1.3, CI: 1.0-1.7) and those diagnosed before 2006 (HR 1.6, CI: 1.2-2.7).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that symptomatic presentation may be an independent negative prognostic indicator for PCa survival.

Subjects and methods:   A total of 45 540 ostensibly healthy men aged 55-69 years who underwent routine health check-ups at Beijing Shijitan Hospital between 2008 and 2015 were included in the study. All the men underwent detailed clinical evaluations. PSA mass density was calculated (serum PSA level × plasma volume ÷ prostate volume) for simultaneously adjusting plasma volume and prostate volume. According to the modified National Cholesterol Education Programme-Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III criteria, patients were dichotomized by the presence of MetS, and differences in PSA density and PSA mass density were compared between groups. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of MetS on serum PSA levels.  Results:   When larger prostate volume in men with MetS was adjusted for, both PSA density and PSA mass density in men with MetS were significantly lower than in men without MetS, and the estimated difference in mean serum PSA level between men with and without MetS was greater than that before adjusting for prostate volume. In the multivariate regression model, the presence of MetS was independently associated with an 11.3% decline in serum PSA levels compared with the absence of MetS. In addition, increasing number of positive MetS components was significantly and linearly associated with decline in serum PSA levels.  Conclusion:   The actual lowering effect of MetS on serum PSA levels was partly concealed by the enlarged prostate in men with MetS, and the presence of MetS was independently associated with lower serum PSA levels.

Patients and methods:   Retrospective study of 514 men with previous prostate biopsy showing no or Gleason score 6 cancer. All had mpMRI, graded 1-5 on a Likert scale for cancer suspicion, and subsequent targeted and 24-core systematic image-fusion guided transperineal biopsy in 2013-2015. The NPVs and PPVs of mpMRIs for detecting Gleason score ≥7 cancer were calculated (±95% confidence intervals) for PSAD ≤0.1, 0.1-0.2, ≤0.2 and >0.2 ng/mL/mL, and compared by chi-square test for linear trend.  Results:   Gleason score ≥7 cancer was detected in 31% of the men. The NPV of Likert 1-2 mpMRI was 0.91 (±0.04) with a PSAD of ≤0.2 ng/mL/mL and 0.71 (±0.16) with a PSAD of >0.2 ng/mL/mL (P = 0.003).

PSAD also significantly affected the PPV of Likert 4-5 mpMRI lesions: the PPV was 0.47 (±0.08) with a PSAD of ≤0.2 ng/mL/mL and 0.66 (±0.10) with a PSAD of >0.2 ng/mL/mL (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In a repeat biopsy setting, a PSAD of ≤0.2 ng/mL/mL is associated with low detection of Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer, not only in men with negative mpMRI, but also in men with equivocal imaging.

We aimed to assess the associations between data-derived blood fatty acid patterns and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study in the Physicians' Health Study. Fatty acids levels were measured in whole blood samples of 476 cases and their matched controls by age and smoking status. Fatty acid patterns were identified using principal component analysis.

Results:   Two patterns explaining 40.9 % of total variation in blood fatty acid levels were identified. Pattern 1, which mainly reflects polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, was suggestively positively related to prostate cancer risk (ORquintile 5 vs. quintile 1 = 1.37, 95 % CI = 0.91-2.05, P trend = 0.07). Pattern 2, which largely reflects de novo lipogenesis, was significantly associated with higher prostate cancer risk (ORquintile5 vs. quintile1 = 1.63, 95 % CI = 1.04-2.55, P trend = 0.02). This association was similar across tumor stage, grade, clinical aggressiveness categories and follow-up time.

While there is no debate about the deleterious impact of violence and other adverse psychosocial exposures on health status, the key question raised here is about the value of routine screening in primary care for such exposures.  Discussion:   Several characteristics of IPV have led to consideration for routine IPV screening in primary care and during other healthcare encounters (e.g., emergency room visits) including: its high prevalence, concern that it may not be raised spontaneously if not prompted, and the burden of suffering associated with this exposure. Despite these factors, there are now three randomized controlled trials showing that screening does not reduce IPV or improve health outcomes. Yet, recommendations to routinely screen for IPV persist. Similarly, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have several characteristics (e.g., high frequency, predictive power of such experiences for subsequent health problems, and concerns that they might not be identified without screening) suggesting they too should be considered for routine primary care screening. However, demonstration of strong associations with health outcomes, and even causality, do not necessarily translate into the benefits of routine screening for such experiences. To date, there have been no controlled trials examining the impact and outcomes - either beneficial or harmful - of routine ACEs screening. Even so, there is an expansion of calls for routine screening for ACEs. While we must prioritize how best to support and intervene with patients who have experienced IPV and other adverse psychosocial exposures, we should not be lulled into a false sense of security that our routine use of ""screeners"" results in better health outcomes or less violence without evidence for such. Decisions about implementation of routine screening for psychosocial concerns need similar rigorous debate and scrutiny of empirical evidence as that recommended for proposed physical health screening (e.g., for prostate and breast cancer).""","""['John D McLennan', 'Harriet L MacMillan']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Fam Pract""","""['Intimate partner violence: analysis of current screening practices in the primary care setting.', 'Screening for Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence in College Women: Missed Opportunities.', ""Women's Healthcare Utilization Following Routine Screening for Past-Year Intimate Partner Violence in the Veterans Health Administration."", 'Intimate partner violence victimization: identification and response in primary care.', 'Intimate Partner Violence and the Rural-Urban-Suburban Divide: Myth or Reality?

Therefore, new strategies to block androgen receptor (AR) function in prostate cancer are required. Here, we report the characterization of a multivalent conjugate presenting two bioactive ethisterone ligands arrayed as spatially defined pendant groups on a peptoid oligomer. The conjugate, named Multivalent Peptoid Conjugate 6 (MPC6), suppressed the proliferation of multiple AR-expressing prostate cancer cell lines including those that failed to respond to enzalutamide and ARN509. The structure-activity relationships of MPC6 variants were evaluated, revealing that increased spacing between ethisterone moieties and changes in peptoid topology eliminated its antiproliferative effect, suggesting that both ethisterone ligand presentation and scaffold characteristics contribute to MPC6 activity. Mechanistically, MPC6 blocked AR coactivator-peptide interaction and prevented AR intermolecular interactions. Protease sensitivity assays suggested that the MPC6-bound AR induced a receptor conformation distinct from that of dihydrotestosterone- or enzalutamide-bound AR. Pharmacologic studies revealed that MPC6 was metabolically stable and displayed a low plasma clearance rate. Notably, MPC6 treatment reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki67 and AR expression in mouse xenograft models of enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP-abl cells. Thus, MPC6 represents a new class of compounds with the potential to combat treatment-resistant prostate cancer.

Objectives:   The aim of this study was to examine whether adherence to the cancer prevention recommendations of the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is associated with reduced all-cause, total cancer, and specific cancer type mortality.  Design:   We built a lifestyle score that included 3 categories, based on the recommendations of the WCRF/AICR. Applying Cox regression models, we investigated the association with all-cause, total cancer, and specific cancer type mortality; in addition, we included cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We used census- and death registry-linked survey data allowing a mortality follow-up for ≤32 y. Our analysis included 16,722 participants. Information on lifestyle score components and confounders was collected at baseline.  Results:   Over a mean follow-up of 21.7 y, 3730 deaths were observed (1332 cancer deaths). Comparing best with poorest category of the lifestyle score showed an inverse association with all-cause (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.89) and total cancer (men only, HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.84) mortality. We estimated that ∼13% of premature cancer deaths in men would have been preventable if lifestyle score levels had been high. Inverse associations were observed for lung, upper aerodigestive tract, stomach, and prostate cancer mortality [men and women combined, HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99; HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.92; HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.83; HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82 (men only), respectively].

This can be achieved by converting the MRI scan to the so-called pseudo-computed tomography (pCT). An obstacle is that the voxel intensities in conventional MRI scans are not uniquely related to electron density. The authors previously demonstrated that a patch-based method could produce accurate pCTs of the brain using conventional T1-weighted MRI scans. The method was driven mainly by local patch similarities and relied on simple affine registrations between an atlas database of the co-registered MRI/CT scan pairs and the MRI scan to be converted. In this study, the authors investigate the applicability of the patch-based approach in the pelvis. This region is challenging for a method based on local similarities due to the greater inter-patient variation. The authors benchmark the method against a baseline pCT strategy where all voxels inside the body contour are assigned a water-equivalent bulk density. Furthermore, the authors implement a parallelized approximate patch search strategy to speed up the pCT generation time to a more clinically relevant level.  Methods:   The data consisted of CT and T1-weighted MRI scans of 10 prostate patients. pCTs were generated using an approximate patch search algorithm in a leave-one-out fashion and compared with the CT using frequently described metrics such as the voxel-wise mean absolute error (MAEvox) and the deviation in water-equivalent path lengths. Furthermore, the dosimetric accuracy was tested for a volumetric modulated arc therapy plan using dose-volume histogram (DVH) point deviations and γ-index analysis.  Results:   The patch-based approach had an average MAEvox of 54 HU; median deviations of less than 0.4% in relevant DVH points and a γ-index pass rate of 0.97 using a 1%/1 mm criterion. The patch-based approach showed a significantly better performance than the baseline water pCT in almost all metrics. The approximate patch search strategy was 70x faster than a brute-force search, with an average prediction time of 20.8 min.  Conclusions:   The authors showed that a patch-based method based on affine registrations and T1-weighted MRI could generate accurate pCTs of the pelvis.

This study aims to show that a MRI-only based RTP workflow is also feasible for proton beam therapy plans generated in MRI-based substitute computed tomography (sCT) images of the head and the pelvis.  Methods:   The sCTs were constructed for ten prostate cancer and ten brain tumor patients primarily by transforming the intensity values of in-phase MR images to Hounsfield units (HUs) with a dual model HU conversion technique to enable heterogeneous tissue representation. HU conversion models for the pelvis were adopted from previous studies, further extended in this study also for head MRI by generating anatomical site-specific conversion models (a new training data set of ten other brain patients). This study also evaluated two other types of simplified sCT: dual bulk density (for bone and water) and homogeneous (water only). For every clinical case, intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans robustly optimized in standard planning CTs were calculated in sCT for evaluation, and vice versa. Overall dose agreement was evaluated using dose-volume histogram parameters and 3D gamma criteria.  Results:   In heterogeneous sCTs, the mean absolute errors in HUs were 34 (soft tissues: 13, bones: 92) and 42 (soft tissues: 9, bones: 97) in the head and in the pelvis, respectively. The maximum absolute dose differences relative to CT in the brain tumor clinical target volume (CTV) were 1.4% for heterogeneous sCT, 1.8% for dual bulk sCT, and 8.9% for homogenous sCT. The corresponding maximum differences in the prostate CTV were 0.6%, 1.2%, and 3.6%, respectively. The percentages of dose points in the head and pelvis passing 1% and 1 mm gamma index criteria were over 91%, 85%, and 38% with heterogeneous, dual bulk, and homogeneous sCTs, respectively. There were no significant changes to gamma index pass rates for IMPT plans first optimized in CT and then calculated in heterogeneous sCT versus IMPT plans first optimized in heterogeneous sCT and then calculated on standard CT.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that proton therapy dose calculations on heterogeneous sCTs are in good agreement with plans generated with standard planning CT.

Methods:   The Clarity calibration and quality assurance phantom was mounted on a motion platform moving with a periodic sine wave trajectory. The detected position of a 30 mm hypoechogenic sphere within the phantom was continuously reported via Clarity's real-time streaming interface to an in-house tracking and delivery software and subsequently used to adapt the MLC aperture. A portal imager measured MV treatment field/MLC apertures and motion platform positions throughout each experiment to independently quantify system latency and geometric error. Based on the measured range of latency values, a prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivery was performed with three realistic motion trajectories. The dosimetric impact of system latency on MLC tracking was directly measured using a 3D dosimeter mounted on the motion platform.  Results:   For 2D US imaging, the overall system latency, including all delay times from the imaging and delivery chain, ranged from 392 to 424 ms depending on the lateral sector size. For 3D US imaging, the latency ranged from 566 to 1031 ms depending on the elevational sweep. The latency-corrected geometric root-mean squared error was below 0.75 mm (2D US) and below 1.75 mm (3D US). For the prostate SBRT delivery, the impact of a range of system latencies (400-1000 ms) on the MLC tracking performance was minimal in terms of gamma failure rate.  Conclusions:   Real-time MLC tracking based on a noninvasive US input is technologically feasible.

For IMRT/VMAT with flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams, however, SAM method would lead to an adverse translational dose effect due to the beam unflattening. Here the authors propose a new two-step process to address both the translational effect of FFF beams and the target deformation.  Methods:   The replanning method consists of an offline and an online step. The offline step is to create a series of preshifted-plans (PSPs) obtained by a so-called ""warm start"" optimization (starting optimization from the original plan, rather than from scratch) at a series of isocenter shifts. The PSPs all have the same number of segments with very similar shapes, since the warm start optimization only adjusts the MLC positions instead of regenerating them. In the online step, a new plan is obtained by picking the closest PSP or linearly interpolating the MLC positions and the monitor units of the closest PSPs for the shift determined from the image of the day. This two-step process is completely automated and almost instantaneous (no optimization or dose calculation needed). The previously developed SAM algorithm is then applied for daily deformation. The authors tested the method on sample prostate and pancreas cases.  Results:   The two-step interpolation method can account for the adverse dose effects from FFF beams, while SAM corrects for the target deformation.

Methods:   This paper discusses the steering of a 20 gauge (G) FBG-integrated needle with three sets of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. A fourth-order polynomial shape reconstruction method is introduced and compared with previous approaches. To control the needle, a bicycle model based navigation method is developed to provide visual guidance lines for clinicians. A real-time model updating method is proposed for needle steering inside inhomogeneous tissue. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed needle shape reconstruction, visual guidance and real-time model updating methods.  Results:   Targeting experiments were performed in soft plastic phantoms and in vitro tissues with insertion depths ranging between 90 and 120 mm. Average targeting errors calculated based upon the acquired camera images were 0.40 ± 0.35 mm in homogeneous plastic phantoms, 0.61 ± 0.45 mm in multilayer plastic phantoms and 0.69 ± 0.25 mm in ex vivo tissue.  Conclusions:   Results endorse the feasibility and accuracy of the needle shape reconstruction and visual guidance methods developed in this work. The approach implemented for the multilayer phantom study could facilitate accurate needle placement efforts in real inhomogeneous tissues.

In this study we assessed the reproducibility of reporting GP4 on prostate biopsies. We analyzed prospectively 422 cores containing GP4 from our consult cases over a period of 2.5 months. The percent pattern 4 was assigned to all the cases in 10% increments from 0% to 100% (with the addition of 5%) by 1 of 4 fellows in urological pathology and by the expert urological pathologist. Out of 422 cores, 32% were an exact match and 75% were within ±10% (weighted κ [κW] value 0.67). Cases were further stratified on the basis of (1) scattered versus clustered GP4 in the background of Gleason pattern 3, (2) continuous versus discontinuous tumor involvement, (3) cribriform/glomeruloid pattern only versus poorly formed/fused pattern versus mixed cribriform and poorly formed/fused pattern, and (4) total tumor involvement of the core (≤10% vs. >10% of the core). No significant differences were observed in the first 3 variables. However, in cases with ≤10% involvement of the core, 61% were within ±10% (κW=0.50) compared with cases with >10% involvement of the core, in which 78% were within ±10% (κW=0.70). In summary, we showed that assessment of percent GP4 was relatively reproducible, with substantial agreement within ±10% in cases. However, with <10% involvement of the core, it was more difficult to assess in smaller foci, with only moderate agreement. Given that in a small focus only a few glands of a given pattern can markedly affect the percent GP4, consideration should be given to not recording percent GP4 in small foci of Gleason score 7 tumors on needle biopsy.""","""['Evita T Sadimin', 'Francesca Khani', 'Mairo Diolombi', 'Abdelrazak Meliti', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Accuracy of Grading Gleason Score 7 Prostatic Adenocarcinoma on Needle Biopsy: Influence of Percent Pattern 4 and Other Histological Factors.', 'Diagnosis of ""Poorly Formed Glands"" Gleason Pattern 4 Prostatic Adenocarcinoma on Needle Biopsy: An Interobserver Reproducibility Study Among Urologic Pathologists With Recommendations.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094=7 prostate cancer with minimal quantity of gleason pattern 4 on needle biopsy is associated with low-risk tumor in radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Region Segmentation of Whole-Slide Images for Analyzing Histological Differentiation of Prostate Adenocarcinoma Using Ensemble EfficientNetB2 U-Net with Transfer Learning Mechanism.', 'Inference of core needle biopsy whole slide images requiring definitive therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The value of artificial intelligence for detection and grading of prostate cancer in human prostatectomy specimens: a validation study.', 'Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Platform for Prostate Cancer Grading and Quantification.', 'Interchangeability of light and virtual microscopy for histopathological evaluation of prostate cancer.']"""

PC cells may survive and function in androgen-deprived environments, where they could establish paracrine signaling networks, providing stimuli for the propagation of local carcinoma cells. We previously demonstrated, using electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPXMA), in LNCaP, PC-3, and Du 145 cell lines that apoptosis is associated with intracellular elemental changes, and that the NE secretory products, bombesin and calcitonin, inhibit etoposide-induced apoptosis, as well as some of these elemental changes. In this study, LNCaP cells were induced in vitro to transdifferentiate under androgen deprivation, to mimic the role of NE cells in the apoptotic activity of transdifferentiated androgen-dependent PC cells. Changes in intracellular ion content associated with apoptosis, assessed by EPXMA, demonstrate that the transdifferentiated LNCaP cells are resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis and also to the etoposide-induced elemental changes. The aggressive malignant potential of PC with neuroendocrine differentiation, associated with hormonal independence, is partly because of the ability that most NE tumor cells have to escape apoptosis, which can enhance the malignant properties of tumor cells and may have therapeutic implications as tumor cells are usually resistant to cytotoxic drugs as etoposide.""","""['Mercedes Salido', 'Jose Vilches']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Microsc Microanal""","""['Neuropeptides, apoptosis and ion changes in prostate cancer.

Objective:   We aimed to assess the evolution of urogenital functions over time after the treatment for rectal cancer.  Design:   This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study.  Settings:   This study was conducted at a quaternary referral center for colorectal surgery.  Patients:   A total of 250 consecutive patients treated for rectal cancer were prospectively enrolled for urogenital assessment.  Main outcome measures:   End points were the International Prostatic Symptom Score, the International Index of Erectile Function, and the Female Sexual Index obtained by questionnaires before (baseline status) and after preoperative radiotherapy and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.  Results:   Overall, 169 patients (68%) responded to the questionnaires.

The authors hypothesized that, in an equal-access setting among patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and no known metastases (M0/Mx), black men would receive imaging tests at similar rates as nonblack men (ie, there would be an equal opportunity to detect metastases) but would have a higher risk of metastatic disease.  Methods:   In total, 837 men who were diagnosed with M0/Mx CRPC during 2000 through 2014 from 5 Veterans Affairs hospitals in the SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database were analyzed. Data on all imaging tests after CRPC diagnosis were collected, including date, type, and outcome. Multivariable Cox models were used to test associations between race and the time to first metastasis, first bone metastasis, first bone scan, second bone scan among men who had a negative first bone scan, and overall survival.  Results:   Black men (n = 306) were equally as likely as nonblack men (n = 531) to receive a first and second bone scan after a diagnosis of CRPC. There were no significant differences in the risk of developing any metastases, bone metastases, time to bone scans, or overall survival between black men and nonblack men (all P > .2).  Conclusions:   The lack of racial differences in the development of metastases and scanning practices observed in this study suggests that, once men have a diagnosis of M0/Mx CRPC, race may not be a prognostic factor. Efforts to understand prostate cancer racial disparities may derive greater benefit by focusing on the risk of developing prostate cancer and on the outcomes of men who have early stage disease.

Patients and methods:   We prospectively followed men with localized prostate cancer undergoing RARP by a single surgeon from August 2012 to October 2015. Patients before April 2014 underwent only bladder neck preservation (controls), while patients after April 2014 also underwent PUS. Patients were given a modified Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire, along with questions depicting objective measures of urinary control (type of pad, number of pads, wetness of pad). Time points queried were preoperatively and postoperatively at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12. Our primary outcome was pad-free survival.  Results:   Questionnaire response rate was 52% (56/107) for controls and 43% (36/83) for PUS. There were no differences in baseline demographics, preoperative urinary control, intraoperative variables, or postoperative complications between groups. There were few subjective improvements in urinary control for PUS compared with controls.

They also wore fewer pads and had less leakage on each pad that lasted from week 1 to week 4 after catheter removal (p < 0.01). PUS patients had pad-free rates of 37%, 47%, 54%, and 60% compared with controls 15%, 18%, 24%, and 36%, at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12 after catheter removal (p = 0.07).  Conclusion:   PUS may improve objective measures of early urinary control compared with controls. With no increase in operative time and no change in complication rates, further work in a randomized setting would provide additional weight to our findings.""","""['Noah E Canvasser', 'Aaron H Lay', 'Ersin Koseoglu', 'Monica S C Morgan', 'Jeffrey A Cadeddu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prevention of Urethral Retraction with Stay Sutures (PURS) During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Improves Early Urinary Control: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current techniques to improve outcomes for early return of urinary continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Acupuncture for prostatectomy incontinence: study protocol for a multicenter single-blind randomized parallel controlled trial.', 'Subsphincteric Anastomosis During Laparoscopic Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Its Positive Impact on Continence Recovery.', 'Simple vs six-branches autologous suburethral sling during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy to improve early urinary continence recovery: prospective randomized study.']"""

In a nationwide case-control study, using Danish high-quality registry data, we evaluated the association between the use of low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified 35,600 patients (cases) with histologically verified prostate cancer during 2000-2012. Cases were matched to 177,992 population controls on age and residence by risk-set sampling. Aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID exposure was defined by type, estimated dose, duration, and consistency of use. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), for prostate cancer associated with low-dose aspirin (75-150 mg) or nonaspirin NSAID use, adjusted for potential confounders.  Results:   Use of low-dose aspirin was associated with an OR for prostate cancer of 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91-0.97). Slightly lower ORs were seen with increasing cumulative amount, duration, and consistency of low-dose aspirin use (continuous use, ≥5 years: OR 0.89; 95 % CI 0.82-0.97; ≥10 years: OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.70-1.06). Nonaspirin NSAID use was associated with a slightly increased OR for prostate cancer (1.13; 95 % CI 1.10-1.15); however, this association was confined to localized disease and did not vary materially with amount, duration, or consistency of nonaspirin NSAID use.  Conclusions:   Our study indicates that long-term, consistent low-dose aspirin use may provide modest protection against prostate cancer. The slightly increased risk of only localized prostate cancer with nonaspirin NSAID use suggests a noncausal explanation of the observed association.""","""['Charlotte Skriver', 'Christian Dehlendorff', 'Michael Borre', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Henrik Toft Sørensen', 'Jesper Hallas', 'Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Søren Friis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Associations of low-dose aspirin or other NSAID use with prostate cancer risk in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study.', 'Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of endometrial cancer: a nationwide case-control study.', 'Low-Dose Aspirin or Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Use and Colorectal Cancer Risk: A Population-Based, Case-Control Study.', 'Effect of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on prostate cancer incidence and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The epidemiology of prostate cancer--with a focus on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.', 'A systematic assessment of the association between frequently prescribed medicines and the risk of common cancers: a series of nested case-control studies.', 'Risks of solid cancers in elderly persons with osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.', 'Diabetes and its Potential Impact on Head and Neck Oncogenesis.', 'Chronic inflammatory diseases, anti-inflammatory medications and risk of prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study.', 'Intake of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods:   A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy of a 10-week self-guided online psychological intervention called My Road Ahead (MRA) for men with localized prostate cancer in improving sexual satisfaction. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions MRA alone or MRA plus online forum, or forum access alone. Pre, post, and follow-up assessments of overall sexual satisfaction were conducted. Mixed models and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data.  Results:   One hundred forty-two men (mean age 61 y; SD = 7) participated. The majority of participants had undergone radical prostatectomy (88%) and all men had received treatment for localized prostate cancer. Significant differences were obtained for the 3 groups (P = .026) and a significant improvement in total sexual satisfaction was observed only for participants who were allocated to MRA + forum with a large effect size (P = .004, partial η2 = 0.256). Structural equation modeling indicated that increases in sexual function, masculine self-esteem, and sexual confidence contributed significantly to overall sexual satisfaction for the MRA + forum plus forum condition.  Conclusions:   This study is the first, to our knowledge, that has evaluated a self-guided online psychological intervention tailored to the specific needs of men with prostate cancer.

Methods:   The study population included 1314 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital during 1995-2009. Causes of deaths were collected from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Individual-level data on medication use during 1995-2009 was obtained from national prescription database. Fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c values during the study period were gathered from hospital district database. Gleason grade and pathological stage were compared by drug use before surgery and separately by metformin usage. Risk of biochemical recurrence, all-cause death and PCa-specific death were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, glycemic control and use of other drug groups.  Results:   High-grade tumors were more common among antidiabetic drug users (P=0.032), including metformin users (P=0.012). Despite this, no difference in PSA levels was observed. Men who had used antidiabetic drugs before surgery had an increased risk of Gleason 7-10 disease (odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-3.23). The risk of high-grade PCa was higher among metformin users compared with other antidiabetic drug users (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.16-8.33). During the median follow-up of 8.6 years after surgery, 551 men had biochemical recurrence and 244 died, 32 owing to PCa. Generally, no association with risk of disease recurrence was observed. Risk of death was increased by preoperative use of antidiabetic drugs (hazard ratio 1.81 95% CI 1.03-3.19), but no survival associations for postoperative use of antidiabetic drugs or metformin were observed.

Given that heterogeneous patient responses are observed, we sought to identify clinical factors associated with duration of abiraterone.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone in our database. Patient characteristics and types and duration of prostate cancer (PC) therapies were analyzed. These parameters were analyzed with duration of abiraterone in univariate and multivariable analyses.  Results:   We identified 161 patients who had received abiraterone. All had received primary androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), 86% prior secondary hormone therapy (SHT) and 33% prior chemotherapy. The median duration of primary ADT was 23 months, duration of SHT (excluding abiraterone) was 17 months and duration of chemotherapy was 8 months. We demonstrated that lower PSA at abiraterone initiation, longer primary ADT duration, no prior ketoconazole, no prior chemotherapy and longer chemotherapy duration were associated with a longer duration on abiraterone in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, duration of primary ADT (duration of abiraterone 9 versus 13 months for ⩽12 versus >12 months, P=0.03) and no use of prior chemotherapy (duration of abiraterone 16 versus 7 months for no versus yes prior chemotherapy, P<0.01) were associated with duration of abiraterone.  Conclusions:   Several clinical parameters, including type and duration of prior therapy, are predictive of responsiveness to abiraterone. These parameters are logical and correlate with smaller disease burden or less exposure to PC therapies.

The diagnosis is mostly based on patient-reported symptoms, and current medication often fails to completely eliminate these symptoms. There is a pressing need for objective non-invasive approaches to measure symptoms and understand disease mechanisms. We developed an in-depth workflow combining urine metabolomics analysis and machine learning bioinformatics to characterize metabolic alterations and support objective diagnosis of LUTS. Machine learning feature selection and statistical tests were combined to identify candidate biomarkers, which were statistically validated with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and absolutely quantified by selected reaction monitoring assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed highly-accurate prediction power of candidate biomarkers to stratify patients into disease or non-diseased categories.

Subjects and methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked databases for men aged 65-79 years who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for cT1 or cT2 prostate cancer from 2000 to 2008. We categorized treatment according to primary therapy and receipt of ADT. We described the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal-related events.  Results:   Among 60,156 men, 14,403 underwent surgery and 45,753 underwent radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6.0 years. After adjusting for baseline differences, treatments with radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] 1.16-1.28, P <.0001-.04) and ADT (aHR 1.18-1.32, P <.0001-.008) were each independently associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac death, fracture, and fracture requiring hospitalization. Radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (aHR 1.20, P = .02), whereas ADT was not (P = .5). We did not identify a significant statistical interaction between primary and hormonal treatment.  Conclusion:   Care for cardiovascular and skeletal-related events is an important part of the survivorship phase for a significant proportion of patients with localized prostate cancer. Increasing use of ADT for patients with localized disease undergoing radiotherapy and the observed higher prevalence of these events in these patients should be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of treatment for localized prostate cancer and when formulating a survivorship plan.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Alyson L Mahar', 'Raj Satkunasivam', 'Sender Herschorn', 'Ronald T Kodama', 'Yuna Lee', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Steven A Narod', 'Robert K Nam']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Differential Risk of Castration Resistance After Initial Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer and the risk of cardiovascular mortality.', 'Risks of Major Long-Term Side Effects Associated with Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary role of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Potential Molecular Connections.', 'Cardiovascular outcomes after curative prostate cancer treatment: A population-based cohort study.', 'Cardiovascular Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and Gleason grade: unravelling implications on survival.', 'CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY.']"""

However it causes autophagy as a protective response in prostate and other types of cancers, thus unveiling the underlying mechanisms may benefit its future application. In the present study, we demonstrate that the miR-17-92a cluster plays a negative role in celastrol induced-autophagy. Dissection of miR-17-92a cluster revealed the role of miR-17 seed family (miR-20a and miR-17) in autophagy inhibition in the context of prostate cancer cells. Autophagy-related gene ATG7 was validated as a target of miR-17 seed family by dual-luciferase assay and qPCR. Celastrol induced autophagy was inhibited by miR-20a or miR-17, while the inhibitory effects were rescued in the presence of pcDNA-ATG7 lacking 3' UTR, demonstrating that these two members target ATG7 to inhibit celastrol-induced autophagy. As celastrol degrades androgen receptor (AR), a key transcription factor in prostate cancer cells, we further investigated whether AR affected miR-17-92a expression in prostate cancer cells. AR binding sites were found in the promoter and two introns of miR-17-92a. In addition, higher expression levels of miR-17-92a were observed in AR positive cells compared with AR negative cells. Ectopic expression of AR could enhance the expression of miR-17-92a cluster in AR-negative prostate cancer cells while knockdown of AR decreased miR-17-92a expression in AR-positive cells, demonstrating the regulation of AR on miR-17-92a transcription. In summary, our results demonstrate that celastrol downregulates AR and its target miR-17-92a, leading to autophagy induction in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jianquan Guo', 'Yu Mei', 'Kai Li', 'Xuemei Huang', 'Huanjie Yang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Celastrol Induces Autophagy by Targeting AR/miR-101 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The other face of miR-17-92a cluster, exhibiting tumor suppressor effects in prostate cancer.', ""Molecular characterization of a novel androgen receptor transgene responsive to MicroRNA mediated post-transcriptional control exerted via 3'-untranslated region."", 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).', 'Multi-omics characterization of autophagy-related molecular features for therapeutic targeting of autophagy.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Celastrol inhibits pathologic neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy by targeting the miR-17-5p/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.']"""

Of the 96-gene panel, 32 genes showed at least 10% differentially methylation level in response to hormonal treatment when compared to untreated cells. Genes that were hypomethylated included CXCL12, CXCL5, CCL25, IL1F8, IL13RAI, STAT5A, CXCR4 and TLR5; and genes that were hypermethylated included ELA2, TOLLIP, LAG3, CD276 and MALT1. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of select genes represented in a cytokine expression array panel showed inverse association between DNA methylation and gene expression for TOLLIP, CXCL5, CCL18 and IL5 genes and treatment of prostate cancer cells with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine with or without trichostatin A induced up-regulation of TOLLIP expression. Further analysis of relative gene expression of matched prostate cancer tissues when compared to benign tissues from individual patients with prostate cancer showed increased and significant expression for CCL18 (2.6-fold; p<0.001), a modest yet significant increase in IL5 expression (1.17-fold; p=0.015), and a modest increase in CXCL5 expression (1.4-fold; p=0.25).

Patients and methods:   Patients with low-risk, low-grade, localised prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled and submitted to a 3-T 16-channel cardiac surface coil mpMRI of the prostate and confirmatory biopsy (CBx), which included a standard biopsy (SBx) and visual estimation-guided TRUS-Bx. Cancer-suspicious regions were defined using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores. Reclassification occurred if CBx confirmed the presence of a Gleason score ≥7, greater than three positive fragments, or ≥50% involvement of any core. The performance of mpMRI for the prediction of CBx results was assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to study relationships between age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density (PSAD), number of positive cores in the initial biopsy, and mpMRI grade on CBx reclassification. Our report is consistent with the Standards of Reporting for MRI-targeted Biopsy Studies (START) guidelines.  Results:   In all, 105 patients were available for analysis in the study. From this cohort, 42 (40%) had PI-RADS 1, 2, or 3 lesions and 63 (60%) had only grade 4 or 5 lesions. Overall, 87 patients underwent visual estimation TRUS-Bx. Reclassification among patients with PI-RADS 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 0%, 23.1%, 9.1%, 74.5%, and 100%, respectively. Overall, mpMRI sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for disease reclassification were 92.5%, 76%, 81%, and 90.5%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, only PSAD and mpMRI remained significant for reclassification (P < 0.05). In the cross-tabulation, SBx would have missed 15 significant cases detected by targeted biopsy, but SBx did detect five cases of significant cancer not detected by targeted biopsy alone.  Conclusion:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is a significant tool for predicting cancer severity reclassification on CBx among AS candidates. The reclassification rate on CBx is particularly high in the group of patients who have PI-RADS grades 4 or 5 lesions.

Hence, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) using anti-androgens, e.g. bicalutamide (BIC) and enzalutamide (ENZ), is a mainstay of treatment. However, the outgrowth of castration resistant PCa (CRPC) cells remains a significant problem. These CRPC cells express androgen receptor (AR) and utilize the intratumoral androgen towards their continued growth and invasion. Sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, can decrease AR protein levels. In the present study, we tested the combined efficacy of anti-androgens and SFN in suppressing PCa cell growth, motility and clonogenic ability. Both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (C4-2B) cells were used to monitor the effects of BIC and ENZ, alone and in combination with SFN. Co-exposure to SFN significantly (p<0.005) enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of anti-androgens and downregulated expression of the AR-responsive gene, prostate specific antigen (PSA) (p<0.05). Exposure to SFN decreased AR protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner with almost no AR detected at 24 h with 15 µM SFN (p<0.005). This rapid and potent AR suppression by SFN occurred by both AR protein degradation, as suggested by cycloheximide (CHX) co-exposure studies, and by suppression of AR gene expression, as evident from quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Pre-exposure to SFN also reduced R1881-stimulated nuclear localization of AR, and combined treatment with SFN and anti-androgens abrogated the mitogenic effects of this AR-agonist (p<0.005). Wound-healing assays revealed that co-exposure to SFN and anti-androgens can significantly (p<0.005) reduce PCa cell migration. In addition, long-term exposures (14 days) to much lower concentrations of these agents, SFN (0.2 µM), BIC (1 µM) and/or ENZ (0.4 µM) significantly (p<0.005) decreased the number of colony forming units (CFUs).

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Unchecked CRPC followed by metastasis is lethal. Some CRPCs show decreased AR gene expression due to epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. The aim of this study was to epigenetically modulate the methylated state of the AR gene leading to targeted demethylation and AR gene expression in androgen-independent human prostate cancer DU145 cell line, representing the CRPC model with very low or undetectable AR levels. The cell treatment was based on single and combined applications of two epigenetic inhibitors, sodium butyrate (NaB) as histone deacetylases inhibitor and 5'-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) as DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. We found that the Aza-dC in combination with NaB may help reduce the toxicity of higher NaB concentrations in cancer cells. In normal RWPE-1 cells and even stronger in cancer DU145 cells, the combined treatment induced both AR gene expression on the mRNA level and increased histone H4 acetylation in AR gene promoter. Also activation and maintenance of G2/M cell cycle arrest and better survival in normal RWPE-1 cells compared to cancer DU145 cells were observed after the treatments. These results imply the selective toxicity effect of both inhibitors used and their potentially more effective combined use in the epigenetic therapy of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Barbora Fialova', 'Petra Luzna', 'Jan Gursky', 'Katerina Langova', 'Zdenek Kolar', 'Katerina Smesny Trtkova']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Effect of histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on the expression of the androgen receptor gene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', ""Demethylation of the miR-146a promoter by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine correlates with delayed progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'HDAC inhibitors with potential to overcome drug resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combining Sodium Butyrate With Cisplatin Increases the Apoptosis of Gastric Cancer In Vivo and In Vitro via the Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway.', ""The Differential Antitumor Activity of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in Prostate Cancer DU145, 22RV1, and LNCaP Cells.""]"""

Emerging evidence suggests that the acidic extracellular microenvironment plays significant roles in the growth and metastasis of tumors. However, the effects of acidity on bone metastasis of PCa remain undefined. In the present study, PC-3 cells were cultured in acidic medium (AM; pH 6.5) or neutral medium (NM; pH 7.4), aiming to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of acidic extracellular microenvironment in bone metastasis of PCa. Our results showed that AM can promote spheroid and colony formations, cell viability and expression of stem cell characteristic-related markers in PC-3 cells. Moreover, AM stimulates MMP-9 secretion and promotes invasiveness of PC-3 cells, and these effects can be inhibited by blocking of MMP-9. Furthermore, AM stimulates VEGF secretion of PC-3 and AM conditioned medium (CMAM) promotes vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs by increasing cell viability, migration, tube formation, which involved activating the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Akt and P38, when pH of NM conditioned medium (CMNM) was modulated the same as AM conditioned medium (CMAM). Further studies have shown that CMNM induced vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs can be inhibited by the inhibition of VEGFR2 with DMH4.

Breast cancers may be associated with PCa, but whether this is true for other tumor types is poorly established. We used a novel approach to study familial associations of any type of cancer with PCa. We assessed the relative risk (RR) for all types of tumors as a function of the number of first-degree relatives diagnosed with PCa. We hypothesized that for a familial association to be real, the RR for a given type of cancer should increase with the number of PCa diagnoses. In families with multiple PCa patients, significantly increased risks were observed for female breast cancer (RR 1.37 for families with three men with PCa), kidney cancer (RR 2.32), nervous system tumors (RR 1.77; RR 2.40 when PCa was diagnosed before age 70 yr), and myeloma (RR 2.44; RR 6.29 when PCa was diagnosed before age 70 yr). Some evidence of association was also found for melanoma (RR 1.82) and endocrine tumors (RR 2.18). The consistency and magnitude of the effects suggest that familial PCa is genetically associated with breast, kidney, and nervous system tumors and myeloma. This suggestion has implications for clinical counseling and design of genetic studies.

Aneuploidies represent common manifestations of chromosome instability, which is frequently observed in human embryos and malignant solid tumors. Activation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV)-derived loci is documented in preimplantation human embryos, hESC, and multiple types of human malignancies. It remains unknown whether the HERV activation may highlight a common molecular pathway contributing to the frequent occurrence of chromosome instability in the early stages of human embryonic development and the emergence of genomic aberrations in cancer. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of human preimplantation embryos reveals activation of specific LTR7/HERVH loci during the transition from the oocytes to zygotes and identifies HERVH network signatures associated with the aneuploidy in human embryos. The correlation patterns' analysis links transcriptome signatures of the HERVH network activation of the in vivo matured human oocytes with gene expression profiles of clinical samples of prostate tumors supporting the existence of a cancer progression pathway from putative precursor lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) to localized and metastatic prostate cancers. Tracking signatures of HERVH networks' activation in tumor samples from cancer patients with known long-term therapy outcomes enabled patients' stratification into sub-groups with markedly distinct likelihoods of therapy failure and death from cancer. Genome-wide analyses of human-specific genetic elements of stem cell-associated retroviruses (SCARs)-regulated networks in 12,093 clinical tumor samples across 29 cancer types revealed pan-cancer genomic signatures of clinically-lethal therapy resistant disease defined by the presence of somatic non-silent mutations (SNMs), gene-level copy number changes, and transcripts and proteins' expression of SCARs-regulated host genes. More than 73% of all cancer deaths occurred in patients whose tumors harbor the SNMs' signatures. Linear regression analysis of the cancer intractability in the United States population demonstrated that organ-specific cancer death rates are directly correlated with the percentages of patients whose tumors harbor the SNMs' signatures.

Objective:   To examine the impact of enzalutamide versus bicalutamide on HRQoL in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   TERRAIN is a multinational, phase 2, randomised, double-blind study in asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men with mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01288911). Patients were randomised (1:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to enzalutamide 160mg/d (n=184) or bicalutamide 50mg/d (n=191), with androgen deprivation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   HRQoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), European Quality of Life 5-Domain Scale (EQ-5D), and Brief Pain Inventory, Short-form questionnaires every 12 wk. Primary and secondary analyses utilised mixed models for repeated measures and pattern mixture models, respectively.  Results and limitations:   At 61 wk, 84 (46%) enzalutamide and 39 (20%) bicalutamide patients in the study were assessed. At 61 wk, changes from baseline favoured enzalutamide versus bicalutamide on three FACT-P domains in mixed models for repeated measures analyses and seven in pattern mixture models analyses.

Risk of first deterioration was lower with enzalutamide for FACT-P total (hazard ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.89, p=0.007), FACT-G total (hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.98, p=0.04), PCS pain (hazard ratio: 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-1.00, p=0.048), and EQ-5D index (hazard ratio: 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.93, p=0.02) scores versus bicalutamide. Brief Pain Inventory, Short-form scores increased in both groups. There was no difference in time-to-pain progression. Study limitations include the exploratory nature of the HRQoL analyses, lack of multiple comparisons corrections, and unknown effects of anxiety/depression on HRQoL.

Objectives:   To identify molecular subgroups of PC bone metastases of relevance for therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Fresh-frozen bone metastasis samples from men with CRPC (n=40), treatment-naïve PC (n=8), or other malignancies (n=12) were characterized using whole-genome expression profiling, multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), and functional enrichment analysis. Expression profiles were verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an extended set of bone metastases (n=77) and compared to levels in malignant and adjacent benign prostate tissue from patients with localized disease (n=12). Selected proteins were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. A cohort of PC patients (n=284) diagnosed at transurethral resection with long follow-up was used for prognostic evaluation.  Results and limitations:   The majority of CRPC bone metastases (80%) was defined as AR-driven based on PCA analysis and high expression of the AR, AR co-regulators (FOXA1, HOXB13), and AR-regulated genes (KLK2, KLK3, NKX3.1, STEAP2, TMPRSS2); 20% were non-AR-driven. Functional enrichment analysis indicated high metabolic activity and low immune responses in AR-driven metastases. Accordingly, infiltration of CD3+ and CD68+ cells was lower in AR-driven than in non-AR-driven metastases, and tumor cell HLA class I ABC immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with nuclear AR immunoreactivity. RT-PCR analysis showed low MHC class I expression (HLA-A, TAP1, and PSMB9 mRNA) in PC bone metastases compared to benign and malignant prostate tissue and bone metastases of other origins. In primary PC, low HLA class I ABC immunoreactivity was associated with high Gleason score, bone metastasis, and short cancer-specific survival. Limitations include the limited number of patients studied and the single metastasis sample studied per patient.  Conclusions:   Most CRPC bone metastases show high AR and metabolic activities and low immune responses. A subgroup instead shows low AR and metabolic activities, but high immune responses. Targeted therapy for these groups should be explored.  Patient summary:   We studied heterogeneities at a molecular level in bone metastasis samples obtained from men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found differences of possible importance for therapy selection in individual patients.""","""['Erik Bovinder Ylitalo', 'Elin Thysell', 'Emma Jernberg', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Sead Crnalic', 'Lars Egevad', 'Pär Stattin', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate Cancer and Immune Monitoring: Are We Heading Towards Better Selection of Patients and Treatment Strategies?', 'Re: Erik Bovinder Ylitalo, Elin Thysell, Emma Jernberg, et al.

Methods and materials:   Considering pre-RT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a surrogate of the number of clonogens, bRFS may be expressed as a function of dose-per-fraction-dependent radiosensitivity (αeff), the number of clonogens for pre-RT PSA = 1 ng/mL (C), and the fraction of patients who relapse because of clonogens outside the treated volume (K), assumed to depend (linearly or exponentially) on pre-RT PSA and Gleason score (GS). Data from 894 node-negative, ≥pT2, pN0 hormone-naive patients treated with adjuvant (n=331) or salvage (n=563) intent were available: 5-year bRFS data were fitted grouping patients according to GS (<7:392, =7:383, >7:119).  Results:   The median follow-up time, pre-RT PSA, and dose were 72 months, 0.25 ng/mL, and 66.6 Gy (range 59.4-77.4 Gy), respectively. The best-fit values were 0.23 to 0.26 Gy(-1) and 10(7) for αeff and C for the model considering a linear dependence between K and PSA. Calibration plots showed good agreement between expected and observed incidences (slope: 0.90-0.93) and moderately high discriminative power (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.68-0.69). Cross-validation showed satisfactory results (average AUCs in the training/validation groups: 0.66-0.70). The resulting dose-effect curves strongly depend on pre-RT PSA and GS. bRFS rapidly decreases with PSA: the maximum obtainable bRFS (defined as 95% of the maximum) declined by about 2.7% and 4.5% for each increment of 0.1 ng/mL for GS <7 and ≥7, respectively.  Conclusions:   Individual data were fitted by a TCP model, and the resulting best-fit parameters were radiobiologically consistent. The model suggests that relapses frequently result from clonogens outside the irradiated volume, supporting the choice of lymph-node irradiation, systemic therapy, or both for specific subgroups (GS <7: PSA >0.8-1.0 ng/mL; GS ≥7: PSA >0.3 ng/mL). Early RT should be preferred over delayed RT; the detrimental effect of PSA increase can never be fully compensated by increasing the dose, especially for patients with GS ≥7.""","""['Claudio Fiorino', 'Sara Broggi', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Gregor Goldner', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Wolfgang Hinkelbein', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Steven Joniau', 'Federica Palorini', 'Shahrokh Shariat', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Hein Van Poppel', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Riccardo Calandrino', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk stratification system and pattern of relapse in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'PSA recurrence following radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant or Salvage Setting: A Systematic Review.', 'Predictors of Patient-Reported Incontinence at Adjuvant/Salvage Radiotherapy after Prostatectomy: Impact of Time between Surgery and Radiotherapy.', 'Predictors of 2-Year Incidence of Patient-Reported Urinary Incontinence After Post-prostatectomy Radiotherapy: Evidence of Dose and Fractionation Effects.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: does the outcome depend on the prostate cancer characteristics?', 'Postoperative adjuvant and very early salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer patients can improve specific and overall survival.']"""

In addition, the improvement of its pharmacokinetic profile (PK) was investigated through the co-administration of a succinylated gelatin plasma expander (Gelofusine), aiming to reduce its kidney accumulation and enhance its tumor-to-normal tissue contrast ratios. Biodistribution data were collected from normal mice and rats, and PC-3 tumor bearing mice, in reference to its PK, metabolism and tumor uptake. Imaging data were also collected from PC-3 tumor bearing mice. Biodistribution and imaging experiments showed that (99m)Tc-BN-O was able to efficiently localize the tumor (5.23 and 7.00% ID/g at 30 and 60min post injection, respectively), while at the same time it was rapidly cleared from the circulation through the kidneys. HPLC analysis of kidney samples, collected at 60min p.i. from normal mice and rats, showed that the majority of radioactivity detected was due to intact peptide i.e. 56% for mice and 73% for rats. Co-administration of (99m)Tc-BN-O with Gelo resulted in the reduction of kidney uptake in both animal models. The integrated area under the curve (AUC30-60 min) from the concentration-time plots of kidneys was decreased in both mice and rats by 25 and 50%, respectively. In PC-3 tumor bearing mice, an increase of tumor uptake (AUCtumor increased by 69%) was also observed with Gelo. An improvement in tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios was noted in all cases with the exception of the pancreas, which normally expresses GRPr.

Patients and methods:   In the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe), 2,574 men assessed with the original Gleason classification and 1,890 men assessed with the modified Gleason classification, diagnosed between 2003 and 2007, underwent primary RP. Histopathology was reported according to the Gleason Grading Groups (GGG): GGG1 = Gleason score (GS) 6, GGG2 = GS 7(3 + 4), GGG3 = GS 7(4 + 3), GGG4 = GS 8 and GGG5 = GS 9-10. Cumulative incidence and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess difference in BCR.  Results:   The cumulative incidence of BCR was lower using the modified compared to the original classification: GGG2 (16% vs. 23%), GGG3 (21% vs. 35%) and GGG4 (18% vs. 34%), respectively.

However, its biological role in thyroid cancer remains totally unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the biological functions of EHF and its potential as a therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay, we evaluated mRNA expression of EHF in a cohort of primary papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) and matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues. The functions of knockdown and ectopic expression of EHF in thyroid cancer cells were determine by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to identify its downstream targets. Our data showed that EHF expression was significantly increased in PTCs compared with matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues. EHF knockdown significantly inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic potential in nude mice and induced cell cycle arrested and apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling pathways.

In this work, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database for somatic point mutations in colorectal cancer revealed that inactivating mutations are absent or extremely rare in CHGs. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we found a strong increase in mRNA levels of the membrane copper transporter 1 protein [CTR1; encoded by the solute carrier family 31 member 1 gene (SLC31A1 gene)] in our series of colorectal carcinoma samples. CTR1 is the main copper influx transporter and changes in its expression are able to induce modifications of cellular copper accumulation. The increased SLC31A1 mRNA level is accompanied by a parallel increase in transcript levels for copper efflux pump ATP7A, copper metabolism Murr1 domain containing 1 (COMMD1), the cytochrome C oxidase assembly factors [synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 1 (SCO1) and cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone 11 (COX11)], the cupric reductase six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP3), and the metal-regulatory transcription factors (MTF1, MTF2) and specificity protein 1 (SP1). The significant correlation between SLC31A1,SCO1, and COX11 mRNA levels suggests that this transcriptional upregulation might be part of a coordinated program of gene regulation. Transcript-level upregulation of SLC31A1,SCO1, and COX11 was also confirmed by the analysis of different colon carcinoma cell lines (Caco-2, HT116, HT29) and cancer cell lines of different tissue origin (MCF7, PC3). Finally, exon-level expression analysis of SLC31A1 reveals differential expression of alternative transcripts in colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa.""","""['Vincenza Barresi', 'Angela Trovato-Salinaro', 'Giorgia Spampinato', 'Nicolò Musso', 'Sergio Castorina', 'Enrico Rizzarelli', 'Daniele Filippo Condorelli']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""FEBS Open Bio""","""['Specific copper transfer from the Cox17 metallochaperone to both Sco1 and Cox11 in the assembly of yeast cytochrome C oxidase.', 'Systematic pan-cancer analysis identifies SLC31A1 as a biomarker in multiple tumor types.', 'The Mitochondrial Metallochaperone SCO1 Is Required to Sustain Expression of the High-Affinity Copper Transporter CTR1 and Preserve Copper Homeostasis.', 'The families of zinc (SLC30 and SLC39) and copper (SLC31) transporters.', 'The mammalian copper transporters CTR1 and CTR2 and their roles in development and disease.', 'The Crucial Findings Derived from the Special Issue ""Inside Cancer Genomics: From Structure to Therapy"".', 'Copper in cancer: from limiting nutrient to therapeutic target.', 'Construction and validation of a novel cuproptosis-mitochondrion prognostic model related with tumor immunity in osteosarcoma.', 'Role of cuproptosis in understanding diseases.', 'The huge potential of targeting copper status in the treatment of colorectal cancer.']"""

The goal of this study was to develop a dual-modality imaging probe that can be used for noninvasive PET imaging and optical imaging of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We designed and synthesized an IRDye 650 and DOTA-conjugated GRPr antagonist, HZ220 (DOTA-Lys(IRDye 650)-PEG4-[D-Phe6, Sta13]-BN(6-14)NH2), by reacting DOTA-Lys-PEG4-[D-Phe6, Sta13]-BN(6-14)NH2 (HZ219) with IRDye 650 N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester. Receptor-specific binding of gallium-labeled HZ220 was characterized in PC-3 prostate cancer cells (PC-3), and tumor uptake in mice was imaged with PET/CT and fluorescence imaging. Receptor binding affinity, in vivo tumor uptake, and biodistribution were compared with the GRPr antagonists HZ219, DOTA-PEG4-[D-Phe6, Sta13]-BN(6-14)NH2 (DOTA-AR), and DOTA-(4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine)-[D-Phe6, Sta13]-BN(6-14)NH2 (DOTA-RM2).  Results:   After hydrophilic-lipophilic balance cartridge purification, 68Ga-HZ220 was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 56% ± 8% (non-decay-corrected), and the radiochemical purity was greater than 95%. Ga-HZ220 had a lower affinity for GRPr (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC50], 21.4 ± 7.4 nM) than Ga-DOTA-AR (IC50, 0.48 ± 0.18 nM) or Ga-HZ219 (IC50, 0.69 ± 0.18 nM). Nevertheless, 68Ga-HZ220 had an in vivo tumor accumulation similar to 68Ga-DOTA-AR (4.63 ± 0.31 vs. 4.07 ± 0.29 percentage injected activity per mL [%IA/mL] at 1 h after injection) but lower than that of 68Ga-DOTA-RM2 (10.4 ± 0.4 %IA/mL). The tumor uptake of 68Ga-HZ220 was blocked significantly with an excessive amount of GRP antagonists. IVIS spectrum imaging also visualized PC-3 xenografts in vivo and ex vivo with a high-contrast ratio. Autoradiography and fluorescent-based microscopic imaging with 68Ga-HZ220 consistently colocated the expression of GRPr. 68Ga-HZ220 displayed a higher kidney uptake than both 68Ga-DOTA-AR and 68Ga-DOTA-RM2 (16.9 ± 6.5 vs. 4.48 ± 1.63 vs. 5.01 ± 2.29 %IA/mL).  Conclusion: 68Ga-HZ220 is a promising bimodal ligand for noninvasive PET imaging and intraoperative optical imaging of GRPr-expressing malignancies.

The need of prostate biopsy in these patients is object of debate. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of intravesical therapy on PSA after transurethral resection (TUR) of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).  Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy for NMIBC were entered. PSA was measured before TUR, before the first and after the sixth instillation, 30 and 90 days after the last instillation. Patients with PSA ≥4 ng/ml or palpable prostate nodule were excluded.  Results:   Out of 130 patients, 105 were evaluable. PSA increase (mean: 7.15 ng/ml) was detected after TUR and before intravesical therapy in 14 patients (13.3%). Of the remaining 91 patients, 65 (71.4%) received chemotherapy and 26 (28.6%) BCG. Median PSA before and during therapy was 1.80 and 1.97 ng/ml, with a 36% median increase in 66 patients (72.5%) (p = 0.13). No statistically significant difference emerged between chemotherapy and BCG (p = 0.22). PSA higher than 4 ng/ml was detected in six (6.3%) and two (2.1%) patients after chemotherapy and BCG, respectively, and was no more evident at 90 days.  Discussion:   PSA increase due to intravesical therapy is rare and usually not clinically significant. PSA rising above 4 ng/ml during intravesical treatment was evident only in 8% of patients. PSA before TUR should be available and considered as the basal value. Elevated PSA detected during therapy should be monitored and biopsy proposed only if persisting more than 3 months after the end.""","""['Vincenzo Serretta', 'Cristina Scalici Gesolfo', 'Fabrizio Di Maida', 'Giovanni Caruana', 'Lorenzo Rocchini', 'Marco Moschini', 'Renzo Colombo', 'Alchiede Simonato']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Is intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy superior to chemotherapy for intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer?

Materials and methods:   Using a prospectively populated database of 3042 men who underwent open radical prostatectomy, patients were grouped according to reported statin use at the time of surgery. The primary outcome was time to biochemical recurrence. The secondary outcome was risk of pathologic upgrading among a subset of 1256 patients with Gleason pattern 3 + 3 = 6 on biopsy. A multivariable Cox model was used to assess risk of biochemical recurrence, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk of pathologic upgrading.  Results:   Eight hundred twenty-four men (27%) reported statin use at the time of radical prostatectomy. Statin users were older and had higher body mass index, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower pretreatment prostate-specific antigen values than statin nonusers. Over a median follow-up of 70 months (interquartile range: 36-107), a total of 455 men (15%) experienced biochemical recurrence. Statin use was not associated with biochemical recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.31).

The Wnt signaling pathway is important for prostate cancer development and progression. Identifying genetic variants associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and reclassification may have a potential role in the management of localized patients. In this study, we used a three-phase design. In phases I and II prostate cancer patient cohort, 578 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 45 genes of the Wnt signaling pathway were analyzed in 1762 localized prostate cancer patients. Twelve SNPs from four regions were significantly associated with aggressive disease, among which, three linked SNPs in CSNK1A1 at 5q32 (represented by rs752822) may differentiate GS 4+3 from GS 3+4 patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.12-1.87, P = 4.76×10(-3)).

However, maximal therapeutic benefit from (131)I-MIBG is likely to be obtained by its combination with chemotherapy. We previously reported enhanced antitumour efficacy of (131)I-MIBG by inhibition of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) DNA repair pathway using the phenanthridinone derivative PJ34. Recently developed alternative PARP-1 inhibitors have greater target specificity and are expected to be associated with reduced toxicity to normal tissue. Therefore, our purpose was to determine whether the more specific PARP-1 inhibitors rucaparib and olaparib enhanced the efficacy of X-radiation or (131)I-MIBG.  Methods:   Radiosensitisation of SK-N-BE(2c) neuroblastoma cells or noradrenaline transporter gene-transfected glioma cells (UVW/NAT) was investigated using clonogenic assay. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry was used to analyse cell cycle progression. DNA damage was quantified by the phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX).  Results:   By combining PARP-1 inhibition with radiation treatment, it was possible to reduce the X-radiation dose or (131)I-MIBG activity concentration required to achieve 50 % cell kill by approximately 50 %. Rucaparib and olaparib were equally effective inhibitors of PARP-1 activity. X-radiation-induced DNA damage was significantly increased 2 h after irradiation by combination with PARP-1 inhibitors (10-fold greater DNA damage compared to untreated controls; p < 0.01). Moreover, combination treatment (i) prevented the restitution of DNA, exemplified by the persistence of 3-fold greater DNA damage after 24 h, compared to untreated controls (p < 0.01) and (ii) induced greater G2/M arrest (p < 0.05) than either single agent alone.  Conclusion:   Rucaparib and olaparib sensitise cancer cells to X-radiation or (131)I-MIBG treatment. It is likely that the mechanism of radiosensitisation entails the accumulation of unrepaired radiation-induced DNA damage. Our findings suggest that the administration of PARP-1 inhibitors and (131)I-MIBG to high risk neuroblastoma patients may be beneficial.""","""['Donna L Nile', 'Colin Rae', 'Iain J Hyndman', 'Mark N Gaze', 'Robert J Mairs']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Inhibition of poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase enhances the toxicity of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine/topotecan combination therapy to cells and xenografts that express the noradrenaline transporter.', 'Stereospecific PARP trapping by BMN 673 and comparison with olaparib and rucaparib.', 'Augmented antitumor activity by olaparib plus AZD1775 in gastric cancer through disrupting DNA damage repair pathways and DNA damage checkpoint.', 'The promising PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer therapy: From Olaparib to others.', 'Clinical Application of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.', 'The PARP inhibitor Rucaparib synergizes with radiation to attenuate atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor growth.', 'BMN673 Is a PARP Inhibitor with Unique Radiosensitizing Properties: Mechanisms and Potential in Radiation Therapy.', 'Development of Novel Pyridine-Thiazole Hybrid Molecules as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Role of PARP Inhibitors in Glioblastoma and Perceiving Challenges as Well as Strategies for Successful Clinical Development.', ""Anti-CD37 radioimmunotherapy with 177Lu-NNV003 synergizes with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in vitro.""]"""

Retrospective analysis of 61 patients with CRPC on AA or enzalutamide, treated at the Boston Medical Center, was performed. We evaluated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and BMI within 2months before the initiation of treatment with AA or enzalutamide and progression-free survival (PFS) under this treatment. Regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to evaluate the data. HbA1c levels were found to predict adversely the PFS on the novel agents (df (1, 37), P=0.00, R(2)=0.40, coeff=-3.28). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that there is significant difference in survival between the HbA1c 4.7-5.9% compared with patients with HbA1c 7.8-11.6% (6.72±1.3months, log rank test P<0.0001) LDL (P=0.07), HDL (P=0.14), and triglycerides (P=0.33) were not found to predict PFS.

The design is based on the plasmonic coupling effect between noble metal nanoparticles. First, the primary and secondary antibodies were conjugated onto the surface of 60 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, act as capture probes) and 50 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, act as signal amplification probes) respectively. In the presence of corresponding antigen, a sandwiched immunocomplex was formed, resulting a significantly enhanced scattering intensity in contrast to that of individual probes. By measuring the intensity change of the particles with a dark-field microscope (DFM), the amount of target protein could be accurately quantified. As a proof of concept experiment, quantification of three types of antigens, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) by this platform was demonstrated with limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7, 3.3, and 5.9 pM, respectively, with a linear dynamic range of 0 to 300 pM. Furthermore, to elucidate the potential in clinical application, the content of antigens in a serum sample was also quantified directly without additional sample pretreatment. In order to validate the reliability of this method, the measured result was also compared with that obtained by regular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, showing good consistency between these two data sets. Therefore, owing to the simplicity and accuracy of this method, it could be potentially applied for massive disease screening in clinical assay in the future.""","""['Chung-Yan Poon', 'Lin Wei', 'Yueling Xu', 'Bo Chen', 'Lehui Xiao', 'Hung-Wing Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Color-Encoded Assays for the Simultaneous Quantification of Dual Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Vertical flow assays based on core-shell SERS nanotags for multiplex prostate cancer biomarker detection.', 'Ultrasensitive non enzymatic multiple immunosensor for tumor markers detection by coupling DNA hybridization chain reaction with intercalated molecules.', 'Immunosensing procedures for carcinoembryonic antigen using graphene and nanocomposites.', 'Nanotechnology-based approaches for effective detection of tumor markers: A comprehensive state-of-the-art review.', 'Nucleic Acids Detection for Mycobacterium tuberculosis Based on Gold Nanoparticles Counting and Rolling-Circle Amplification.', 'Cancer Diagnosis through SERS and Other Related Techniques.', 'Advances in Optical Single-Molecule Detection: En\u2005Route to Supersensitive Bioaffinity Assays.', 'Optical aptasensing of mercury(II) by using salt-induced and exonuclease I-induced gold nanoparticle aggregation under dark-field microscope observation.', 'Colorimetric and dark-field microscopic determination of cadmium(II) using unmodified gold nanoparticles and\xa0based on the formation of glutathione-cadmium(II) complexes.']"""

Methods and materials:   We report our initial findings from a cohort of 41 patients, of the first enrolled on a randomized controlled trial, who were randomized to the (18)F-fluciclovine arm. All patients underwent (18)F-fluciclovine PET-CT for the detection of metabolic abnormalities and high-resolution CT for treatment planning. The 2 datasets were registered first by use of a rigid registration. If soft tissue displacement was observable, the rigid registration was improved with a deformable registration. Each (18)F-fluciclovine abnormality was segmented as a percentage of the maximum standard uptake value (SUV) within a small region of interest around the lesion. The percentage best describing the SUV falloff was integrated in planning by expanding standard target volumes with the PET abnormality.  Results:   In 21 of 55 abnormalities, a deformable registration was needed to map the (18)F-fluciclovine activity into the simulation CT. The most selected percentage was 50% of maximum SUV, although values ranging from 15% to 70% were used for specific patients, illustrating the need for a per-patient selection of a threshold SUV value. The inclusion of (18)F-fluciclovine changed the planning volumes for 46 abnormalities (83%) of the total 55, with 28 (51%) located in the lymph nodes, 11 (20%) in the prostate bed, 10 (18%) in the prostate, and 6 (11%) in the seminal vesicles. Only 9 PET abnormalities were fully contained in the standard target volumes based on the CT-based segmentations and did not necessitate expansion.

Setting The ERSPC has shown a 21% reduction in prostate cancer mortality in men invited to screening with follow-up truncated at 13 years. Centres either used pre-consent randomisation (effectiveness design) or post-consent randomisation (efficacy design). Methods In six centres (three effectiveness design, three efficacy design) with follow-up until the end of 2010, or maximum 13 years, the effect of screening was estimated as both effectiveness (mortality reduction in the target population) and efficacy (reduction in those actually screened). Results The overall crude prostate cancer mortality risk ratio in the intervention arm vs control arm for the six centres was 0.79 ranging from a 14% increase to a 38% reduction. The risk ratio was 0.85 in centres with effectiveness design and 0.73 in those with efficacy design. After correcting for design, overall efficacy was 27%, 24% in pre-consent and 29% in post-consent centres, ranging between a 12% increase and a 52% reduction. Conclusion The estimated overall effect of screening in attenders (efficacy) was a 27% reduction in prostate cancer mortality at 13 years' follow-up. The variation in efficacy between centres was greater than the range in risk ratio without correction for design.

Nevertheless, it has been assumed that the nuclear pH is regulated by the cytoplasmic proton transporters via the diffusion of H+ across the nuclear pores because of their large diameter. However, it has been demonstrated that ion gradients exist between cytosol and nucleus, suggesting that the permeability of ions across the nuclear pores is restricted. Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-H+-ATPase) is responsible for the creation and maintenance of trans-membrane electrochemical gradient. We hypothesize that V-H+-ATPase located in the nuclear membranes functions as the primary mechanism to regulate nuclear pH and generate H+ gradients across the nuclear envelope. We studied the subcellular heterogeneity of H+ concentration in the nucleus and cytosol using ratio imaging microscopy and SNARF-1, a pH indicator, in prostate cells. Our results indicate that there are proton gradients across the nuclear membranes that are generated by V-H+-ATPase located in the outer and inner nuclear membranes. We demonstrated that these gradients are mostly dissipated by inhibiting V-H+-ATPase. Immunoblots and V-H+-ATPase activity corroborated the existence of V-H+-ATPase in the nuclear membranes. This study demonstrates that V-H+-ATPase is functionally expressed in nuclear membranes and is responsible for nuclear H+ gradients that may promote not only the coupled transport of substrates, but also most electrochemically driven events across the nuclear membranes. This study represents a paradigm shift that the nucleus can regulate its own pH microenvironment, providing new insights into nuclear ion homeostasis and signaling.""","""['Julianna Maria Santos', 'Raul Martínez-Zaguilán', 'Arnoldo Rocha Facanha', 'Fazle Hussain', 'Souad R Sennoune']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Cell Physiol""","""['Nuclear V-type ATPase.

Methods:   Multiparametric MRIs (mpMRI) of 50 consecutive patients with biopsy proven PCa, which had originally been evaluated according to PIRADS v1, were now retrospectively re-evaluated, comparing PI-RADS v1 and v2. MpMRI data were evaluated in comparison with histopathological whole-mount step-section slides. MRI examinations included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.  Results:   Overall PI-RADS v1 showed a significantly larger discriminative ability of tumor detection: PI-RADS v1 AUC 0.96 (95 % CI 0.94-0.98) and v2 AUC 0.90 (95 % CI 0.86-0.94). For peripheral zone lesions, PI-RADS v1 showed a significantly larger ability of PCa discrimination: v1 AUC 0.97 (95 % CI 0.95-0.99) and v2 AUC 0.92 (95 % CI 0.88-0.96). For transition zone lesions, PI-RADS v1 showed more discrimination: v1 AUC 0.96 (95 % CI 0.92-1.00) and v2 0.90 (95 % CI 0.83-0.97), but the difference was not significant. PI-RADS v2 resulted in significantly more false negative results (3 % in v1, 14 % in v2) and a comparable number of true positive results (82 % in v1, 80 % in v2).  Conclusion:   PI-RADS v2 uses a simplified approach, but shows a lower diagnostic accuracy. This could lead to a higher rate of false negative results with the risk of missing tumors within low PI-RADS score levels.

We measured patients' baseline preferences prior to their urology appointments, including initial treatment preference, cancer-related anxiety, and interest in sex.

Results:   Patients' initial treatment preferences did not predict receipt of active treatment versus surveillance, Δχ2(4) = 3.67, P = 0.45. Instead, receipt of active treatment was predicted primarily by urologists' recommendations, Δχ2(2) = 32.81, P < 0.001.

Chronic Cd exposure malignantly transforms RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells into CTPE cells by an unclear mechanism. Previous studies show that RWPE-1 can also be malignantly transformed by arsenic, and KRAS activation is key to causation and maintenance of this phenotype. Although Cd and arsenic can both transform prostate epithelial cells, it is uncertain whether their mechanisms are similar. Thus, here we determined whether KRAS activation is critical in causing and maintaining Cd-induced malignant transformation in CTPE cells. Expression of KRAS, miRNAs, and other genes of interest was analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. Following stable KRAS knockdown (KD) by RNA interference using shRNAmir, the malignant phenotype was assessed by various physical and genetic parameters. CTPE cells greatly overexpressed KRAS by 20-fold, indicating a likely role in Cd transformation. Thus, we attempted to reverse the malignant phenotype via KRAS KD. Two weeks after shRNAmir transduction, KRAS protein was undetectable in CTPE KD cells, confirming stable KD. KRAS KD reduced stimulated RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and markedly mitigated multiple physical and molecular malignant cell characteristics including: hypersecretion of MMP-2, colony formation, cell survival, and expression of cancer-relevant genes (reduced proliferation and cell cycle-related genes; activated tumor suppressor PTEN). However, KRAS KD did not reverse miRNA expression originally down-regulated by Cd transformation. These data strongly suggest KRAS is a key gene in development and maintenance of the Cd-induced malignant phenotype, at least in the prostate. It is not, however, the only genetic factor sustaining this phenotype.""","""['Ntube N O Ngalame', 'Michael P Waalkes', 'Erik J Tokar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chem Res Toxicol""","""['Silencing KRAS overexpression in arsenic-transformed prostate epithelial and stem cells partially mitigates malignant phenotype.', 'Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls RAS oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic.', 'Arsenic Alters Exosome Quantity and Cargo to Mediate Stem Cell Recruitment Into a Cancer Stem Cell-Like Phenotype.', 'Biological and molecular modifications induced by cadmium and arsenic during breast and prostate cancer development.', 'Is Nanoclustering essential for all oncogenic KRas pathways?

In this exploratory study, we hypothesized that the expression of vinculin (VCL) and chemokine X3C ligand 1 (CX3CL1) might be downregulated in clinical samples, most likely due to the posttranscriptional modification by microRNAs. Targeted genes would be upregulated upon transfection of the bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC3, with specific microRNA inhibitors.  Materials and methods:   MicroRNA software predicted that miR21 targets VCL while miR29a targets CX3CL1. Twenty benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 16 high grade CaP formalinfixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens were analysed. From the bone scan results, high grade CaP samples were further classified into CaP with no BM and CaP with BM. Transient transfection with respective microRNA inhibitors was done in both RWPE1 (normal) and PC3 cell lines. QPCR was performed in all FFPE samples and transfected cell lines to measure VCL and CX3CL1 levels.  Results:   QPCR confirmed that VCL messenger RNA (mRNA) was significantly down regulated while CX3CL1 was upregulated in all FFPE specimens. Transient transfection with microRNA inhibitors in PC3 cells followed by qPCR of the targeted genes showed that VCL mRNA was significantly up regulated while CX3CL1 mRNA was significantly downregulated compared to the RWPE1 case.  Conclusions:   The downregulation of VCL in FFPE specimens is most likely regulated by miR21 based on the in vitro evidence but the exact mechanism of how miR21 can regulate VCL is unclear. Upregulated in CaP, CX3CL1 was found not regulated by miR29a. More microRNA screening is required to understand the regulation of this chemokine in CaP with bone metastasis.

Metastasis may result in failure of conventional treatment and death Hence, research on metastatic suppressors in cancer is a high priority. The metastatic suppressor gene CD82, also known as KAI1, is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily which was first identified in carcinoma of prostate. Little work has been done on this gene in breast cancer. Herein, we aimed to determine the gene and protein level expression of CD82/KAI1 in breast cancer and its role as a prognosticator.  Materials and methods:   In this study, 83 histologically proven cases of breast cancer and a similar number of controls were included. Patient age ranged from 1870 years. Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate KAI1 expression at gene and protein levels, respectively. Statistical analysis was done to correlate expression of KAI1 and clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   It was revealed that: (i) KAI1 was remarkably diminished in metastatic vs non metastatic breast cancer both at the gene and the protein levels (P<.05); (ii) KAI1 expression levels were strongly correlated with TNM staging, histological grade and advanced stage (p<0.001) and no association was found with any other studied parameter; (iii) Lastly, a significant correlation was observed between expression of KAI1 and overall median survival of BC patients (P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that lack of expression of the KAI1 might indicate a more aggressive form of breast cancer. Loss of KAI1 may be considered a significant prognostic marker in predicting metastatic manifestation. When evaluated along with the clinical and pathological factors, KAI1 expression may be beneficial to tailor aggressive therapeutic strategies for such patients.""","""['Richa Singh', 'Madan Lal Brahma Bhatt', 'Saurabh Pratap Singh', 'Vijay Kumar', 'Madhu Mati Goel', 'Durga Prasad Mishra', 'Kirti Srivastava', 'Rajendra Kumar']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'Role of a metastatic suppressor gene KAI1/CD82 in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.', 'Down Regulation of KAI1/CD82 in Lymph Node Positive and Advanced T-Stage Group in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'The expression of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 and KAI1 in gastric adenocarcinoma and their clinical significance.', 'Evaluation of the correlation of KAI1/CD82, CD44, MMP7 and β-catenin in the prediction of prognosis and metastasis in colorectal carcinoma.', 'Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'Role of a metastatic suppressor gene KAI1/CD82 in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.', 'Down Regulation of KAI1/CD82 in Lymph Node Positive and Advanced T-Stage Group in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Significance of MMP-9 and VEGF-C expression in North Indian women with breast cancer diagnosis.', '10 Year Biochemical Failure Free Survival of Men with CD82 Positive Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Results:   Totals of 649 men attended Hospital A, and 552 men attended Hospital B; there were no significant differences in age or serum PSA levels. In Hospital A, 228 (35.1%) men had prostate cancer detected, CPC detection had a sensitivity of 80.7%, a specificity of 88.6%, and a negative predictive value of 89.5%. Some 39/44 men CPC negative with a positive biopsy had low grade small volume tumors. In Hospital B, 316 (57.2%) underwent biopsy. There were no significant differences between populations in terms of CPC and biopsy results. The reduction in the number of biopsies was 40%.

Materials and methods:   A single centre prospective study of men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy was conducted between 2004 and 2014. Clinicalpathological details were registered, along with total serum PSA presurgery, Gleason score, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins, infiltration of lymph nodes, seminal vesicles and pathological stage. Primary circulating prostate cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation and detected using standard immunocytochemistry with antiPSA. Biochemical failure was defined as a PSA >0.2ng/ml, predictive values were calculated using the Walz nomagram and CPC detection.  Results:   A total of 285 men participated, of whom 103/285 (36.1%) suffered biochemcial failure; 32/103 (31.1%) within two years of radical prostatectomy. Men with higher Gleason scores, higher pathological stage, infiltration of the surgical margin or prostate capsule and infiltration of seminal vesicles were more likely to undergo biochemical failure. There was a significant increase in the frequency of biochemical failure with increasing number of CPCs detected (p<0.0004 Chi squared for trend) and increasing percent prediction for the Walz nomogram (p<0.0001 Chi squared for trends). The positive predictive value of primary CPC detection, even using a cutoff point of ≥ 4 cells/sample was very low.  Conclusions:   The detection of primary CPCs in men as a prognostic factor pretreatment fails to identify those at high risk of biochemical failure within two years of curative therapy.

Socioeconomic level, health behaviors and cancer incidence were compared between the groups and Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for potential confounders assessed hazard risk ratios for cancer by exposure status. All-cause mortality was studied as a competing risk. In total, 241, 682, and 522 cancer cases were diagnosed in the E, PE, and NE, respectively.

Integrin internalization is an important determinant of their cell surface expression and function. Using flow cytometry, and first order kinetic modeling, we quantitated the intrinsic internalization rates of integrin subunits in a single cycle of internalization. In PCa cell line DU145, α6 integrin internalized with a rate constant (kactual ) of 3.25 min-1 , threefold faster than α3 integrin (1.0 min-1 ), 1.5-fold faster than the vitronectin binding αv integrin (CD51) (2.2 min-1 ), and significantly slower than the unrelated transferrin receptor (CD71) (15 min-1 ). Silencing of α3 integrin protein expression in DU145, PC3, and PC3B1 cells resulted in up to a 1.71-fold increase in kactual for α6 integrin. The internalized α6 integrin was targeted to early endosomes but not to lamp1 vesicles. Depletion of α3 integrin expression resulted in redistribution of α6β4 integrin to an observed cell-cell staining pattern that is consistent with a suprabasal distribution observed in epidermis and early PIN lesions in PCa. Depletion of α3 integrin increased cell migration by 1.8-fold, which was dependent on α6β1 integrin. Silencing of α6 integrin expression however, had no significant effect on the kactual of α3 integrin or its distribution in early endosomes. These results indicate that α3 and α6 integrins have significantly different internalization kinetics and that coordination exists between them for internalization. J. Cell.

No antioxidant effects were displayed by both compounds, though CuIrb behaved as a weak 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(·)) scavenger (IC50 = 425 μM). The measurements of the contractile capacity on human mesangial cell lines showed that CuIrb improved the antihypertensive effects of the parent medication. In vitro cell growth inhibition against prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU 145) was measured for CuIrb, irbesartan and copper(II). These cell lines have been selected since the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor (that was blocked by the angiotensin receptor blockers, ARB) has been identified in them.

Results:   In the sample as a whole the participants who were more emotionally distressed at diagnosis were more likely to choose surgery over active surveillance (RRR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01, 1.14; p=0.02). Men who were more distressed close to the time they made a treatment choice were more likely to have chosen surgery over active surveillance (RRR 1.16; 95% CI 1.09, 1.24; p <0.001) or surgery over radiation (RRR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05, 1.19; p=0.001). This pattern was also found in men with low risk disease.  Conclusions:   Emotional distress may motivate men with low risk prostate cancer to choose more aggressive treatment. Addressing emotional distress before and during treatment decision making may reduce a barrier to the uptake of active surveillance.""","""['Heather Orom', 'Willie Underwood rd', 'Caitlin Biddle']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""[""Prospective study of men's psychological and decision-related adjustment after treatment for localized prostate cancer."", 'Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'A longitudinal study on the impact of active surveillance for prostate cancer on anxiety and distress levels.', 'Psychological aspects of active surveillance.', 'Patient reported factors influencing the decision-making process of men with localised prostate cancer when considering Active Surveillance-A systematic review and thematic synthesis.', 'Challenges to Recruiting Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Clinical Chemoprevention Trials.', 'Effects of Green Tea Catechins on Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention: The Role of the Gut Microbiome.', 'Concordance between influential adverse treatment outcomes and localized prostate cancer treatment decisions.', 'Development of the Prostate Cancer Treatment Decision Framework: A Context-Specific Expansion of the Risk-as-Feelings Hypothesis.', 'The Treatment Decision-making Preferences of Patients with Prostate Cancer Should Be Recorded in Research and Clinical Routine: a Pooled Analysis of Four Survey Studies with 7169 Patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 12,624 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2007 to 2013. The association of the number of biopsy sessions (range 1 to 3 or more) with pathological outcomes and perioperative complications was analyzed using the Wilcoxon matched pair test. To test the association between biopsy sessions and biochemical recurrence-free survival we used Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Of the patients 89.2% had 1 biopsy session, 7.4% had 2 sessions and 3.4% had 3 or more sessions. Median followup was 36.6 months. In patients with 1, 2 and 3 or more biopsy sessions prostate volume (38, 44 and 45 ml) and prostate specific antigen (6.7, 7.6 and 10.1 ng/ml, respectively) were greater (each p <0.001). The perioperative outcome was more favorable. Patients with 1, 2 and 3 or more biopsy sessions more often had organ confined tumors (67.6%, 72.1% and 72.9%, p = 0.003) and higher tumor volume (3.1, 3.0 and 3.6 ml, p <0.001) but a lower tumor percent (7.5%, 3.7% and 2.4%, respectively, p <0.001). More biopsy sessions were associated with fewer lymph node metastases (1, 2 and 3 sessions 0.23, 0.13 and 0.17, respectively, p <0.001). Gleason score and surgical margin status did not differ. The overall biochemical recurrence rate was 18.9% and it was comparable among the biopsy groups. No association was found between the number of biopsies and biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Patients with multiple biopsy sessions experience a slightly more favorable pathological outcome without an impact on the oncologic outcome. The perioperative outcome was more favorable in patients with multiple biopsies.""","""['Clemens M Rosenbaum', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Katharina Boehm', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Derya Tilki', 'Georg Salomon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Limitations in Predicting Organ Confined Prostate Cancer in Patients with Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Prognostic Factors for Biochemical Recurrence More than 10 Years after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Homologous blood transfusion in patients with prostate cancer: no effect on tumor progression or survival.', 'Association between previous negative biopsies and lower rates of progression during active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical proteomics for prostate cancer: understanding prostate cancer pathology and protein biomarkers for improved disease management.']"""

Methods:   Thirty-one mCRPC patients with progressive disease despite second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CCPET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients then underwent quarterly 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy. Hematological, kidney function, liver function tests, and serum PSA levels were recorded before and after therapy at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 month intervals. Biochemical response was assessed with trend in serum PSA levels. Metabolic response was assessed by PERCIST 1 criteria. Clinical response was assessed by visual analogue score (VASmax) analgesic score (AS), Karanofsky performance status (KPS), and ttoxicity and response criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 65.93 ± 9.77 years (range: 38-81 years). The mean activity administered in the 31 patients was 5069 ± 1845 MBq ranging from one to four cycles. There was a decline in the mean serum PSA levels from the baseline (baseline: 275 ng/mL, post 1st cycle therapy: 141.75 ng/mL). Based on biochemical response criteria 2/31, 20/31, 3/31, and 6/31 had complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), respectively.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a label-free method with immobilized anti-PSA was applied for PSA detection and lectins to glycoprofile captured PSA on the same surface. A proper choice of blocking agent providing high selectivity of biosensor detection with the immobilized anti-PSA antibody was done. The biosensor could detect PSA down to 100 ag/mL with a linear concentration working range from 100 ag/mL up to 1 μg/mL, i.e. 10 orders of concentration magnitude and the sensitivity of (5.5 ± 0.2)%/decade. The results showed that a commercial carbo-free blocking solution was the best one, reducing non-specific binding 55-fold when compared to the immunosensor surface without any blocking agent applied, while allowing to detect PSA. The biosensor response obtained after addition of lectin (i.e. proportional to the amount of a particular glycan on PSA) divided by the biosensor response obtained after incubation with a sample (i.e. proportional to the PSA level in the sample) was applied to distinguish serum samples of PCa patients from those of healthy individuals. The results showed that Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) recognizing α-2,3-terminal sialic acid can be applied to distinguish between these two sets of samples since the MAA/PSA response obtained from the analysis of the PCa samples was significantly higher (5.3-fold) compared to the MAA/PSA response obtained by the analysis of samples from healthy individuals.

The most interest on the bacterial cancer therapy is about Salmonella spp. with a special emphasis of S.Typhimurium. The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumorigenic effects of food-borne non-pathogenic and pathogenic Salmonella enterica strains on different cell cultures. Non-pathogenic Salmonella Enteriditis (A17) and pathogenic Salmonella Telaviv (A22) strains isolated from chicken carcasses which were put on the market in Edirne province (located at Thrace region of Turkey), and Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain were used in the study. ATCC-derived MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), DU145 (human prostate cancer cells), and HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) cell lines were cocultivated with Salmonella strains of MOI (Multiplicity of infection; number of bacteria:number of cell) of 1000:1, 100:1, 10:1, 1:1, 0.1:1. The cell viability was measured by colorimetric MTT cytotoxicity assay, the percentage of apoptosis was assessed by Tali® Apoptosis Assay-Annexin V Alexa Fluor® 488 kit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA), and the caspase-3 activity was determined by colorimetric protease ApoTarget™ kit (Invitrogen, BioSource International, USA). It was shown that non-pathogenic S.Enteriditis (A17) decreased cell viability approximately to 70%, wheras patogenic S.Telaviv (A22) and standart S.Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strains reduced cell viability approximately to 80%. Adversely, it was also observed that pathogenic S.Telaviv (A22) strain induces apoptosis more effectively than non-pathogenic S.Enteriditis (A17) and S.Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strains. Apoptosis percentage induced by pathogenic S.Telaviv (A22) strain was approximately 15% while 5% for both non-pathogenic S.Enteriditis (A17) and S.Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strains. Similarly, average OD405 values of caspase-3 activity was shown as 0.01 for both non-pathogenic S.Enteriditis (A17) and S.Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strains whereas average OD405 value of caspase-3 activity for pathogenic S.Telaviv (A22) strain was very close to 0.02 and it doubled the value for negative control.

Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with metastatic prostate cancer. However, their potential roles for affecting prostate cancer initiation and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the aberrant expression profiles of miRNAs in human metastatic prostate cancer tissues. We further validated our miRNA expression data using two large, independent clinical prostate cancer datasets from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our data support a model in which hsa-miR-135-1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in metastatic prostate cancer. First, its downregulation was positively correlated with late TNM stage, high Gleason score, and adverse prognosis. Second, cell growth, cell cycle progression, cell migration and invasion, and xenograft tumor formation were dramatically inhibited by miR-135a overexpression. Third, in the microarray gene expression data analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and Oncomine concept analysis, we showed that miR-135a targets multiple oncogenic pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which we verified using functional experimental assays.

Background:   Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis.  Design:   All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study.  Methods:   Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status.  Results:   Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication.  Conclusion:   Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.""","""['Dot Brown', 'John Oetzel', 'Alison Henderson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""[""Men's use of networks to manage communication tensions related to a\xa0potential diagnosis of prostate cancer."", 'Disclosure of diagnosis and treatment among early stage prostate cancer survivors.', '""Prostate cancer is far more hidden…"": Perceptions of stigma, social isolation and help-seeking among men with prostate cancer.', 'Are schizophrenic patients being told their diagnosis today in France?.', ""Prostate cancer and supportive care: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of men's experiences and unmet needs."", ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", ""Men's perception of information and descriptions of emotional strain in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer-a qualitative individual interview study."", 'Sources of Information for Learning and Decision-Making in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding health decision making: An exploration of homophily.']"""

Hyperthermia (HT) is known to serve as a powerful tool in treatment of prostate cancer in clinical. The combination treatment with HT and cisplatin has a synergistic effect to inhibit prostate cancer progression and demonstrates better clinical effectiveness than HT or chemotherapy alone. But molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been illuminated clearly. In this study, we used MTS assay to examine cell viabilities of PC-3, LNCaP, DU-145 and RM-1 cells after treated by HT and cisplatin. Then colony formation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells after treated with HT and cisplatin were photographed. To investigate whether the combination therapy would enhance apoptosis of PC-3 and DU-145 cells, we used Western blot analysis to detect expression level of proteins on apoptosis-regulated signaling pathway in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Our results showed that the combination treatment decreased cell viabilities and colony formation of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and this combination therapy enhanced apoptosis of PC-3 and DU-145 cells via activation of Caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. We also found that the combination therapy could down-regulate the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and IAP family proteins. At last, the combination therapy activated AMPKα-JNK signaling pathway and inhibited Akt-mTOR-p70s6k signaling pathway to promote apoptosis of PC-3 and DU-145 cells. In conclusion, this study clearly elucidated how the combination therapy with HT and cisplatin promoted apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in synergy.""","""['Jian-Fu Zhang', 'Xiang-Ming Yan', 'Bin Lan', 'Yin-Rui Lei', 'Xiao-Hu Li', 'Shuai Gao', 'Yi-Feng Guo', 'Fang Guo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Cisplatin in combination with programmed cell death protein\xa05 increases antitumor activity in prostate cancer cells by promoting apoptosis.', 'R115777 (Zarnestra)/Zoledronic acid (Zometa) cooperation on inhibition of prostate cancer proliferation is paralleled by Erk/Akt inactivation and reduced Bcl-2 and bad phosphorylation.', 'Novel titanocene anti-cancer drugs and their effect on apoptosis and the apoptotic pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'PAR-4 as a possible new target for pancreatic cancer therapy.', 'Novel targeting of apoptosis pathways for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Development of handheld induction heaters for magnetic fluid hyperthermia applications andin-vitroevaluation on ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Hyperthermia Treatment as a Promising Anti-Cancer Strategy: Therapeutic Targets, Perspective Mechanisms and Synergistic Combinations in Experimental Approaches.', 'Ferroptosis: Cancer Stem Cells Rely on Iron until ""to Die for"" It.', 'miR-451 on Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion in Rats by Regulating AMPK Signaling Pathway.', 'Microwave hyperthermia promotes caspase‑3-dependent apoptosis and induces G2/M checkpoint arrest via the ATM pathway in non‑small cell lung cancer cells.']"""

However, imaging and surgical series have demonstrated a high frequency of prostatic lymph node (LN) drainage beyond these landmarks.  Objective:   To determine the patterns of radiographically defined abdominopelvic LN failures and their potential implications for PRT field design.  Design, setting, and participants:   During 1992-2008, 2694 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with prostate/seminal vesicle-only radiotherapy without PRT. Some 156 patients had their first failure within the abdominopelvic LNs, of whom 60 had isolated failures within the pelvic LNs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A radiologist reviewed all imaging and mapped each LN failure to a template consisting of 34 abdominopelvic LN stations.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 8.9 yr. Of patients who experienced first recurrence in the pelvic LNs (n=60), the common iliac station was involved in 55% (n=33) of patients, including 10% (n=6) who had isolated common iliac failures. Use of a PRT field superior border of L5/S1 would fully cover only 42% of the first recurrences among these patients. Extending the field to cover the common iliac stations would increase coverage to 93% of recurrences. The presence of T3/T4 disease and omission of androgen-deprivation therapy both independently conferred an approximate fivefold increase in the likelihood of having a common iliac LN failure. Use of imaging as a surrogate for LN involvement is the primary study limitation.  Conclusions:   Pelvic LN failures frequently occur superior to the commonly used L5/S1 landmark for PRT coverage, and use of ADT may be protective of more superior LN failures. The current RTOG 0924 trial is evaluating the benefit of PRT with extended superior coverage to L4/5 when possible, which, according to our data, should significantly improve the coverage of potential sites of failure.  Patient summary:   We looked at lymph node recurrence patterns after external beam radiotherapy of the prostate in men who did not have their lymph nodes treated. We found that there was a high incidence of pelvic lymph node recurrences above the internal and external iliac lymph node regions. Therefore, the current field recommendation for pelvic lymph nodes that stops at the superior border of the internal and external iliac vessels provides inadequate coverage of common sites of cancer recurrence, namely the common iliac lymph nodes.""","""['Daniel E Spratt', 'Hebert A Vargas', 'Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Jennifer S Golia Pernicka', 'Joseph R Osborne', 'Xin Pei', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Whole-pelvis Radiotherapy in the Radiation Treatment of Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer: How to Improve the Therapeutic Ratio of a Potentially Effective but still Unsatisfactory Treatment?', ""Reply to Filippo Alongi, Rosario Mazzola, Dario Aiello and Matteo Salgarello's Letter to the Editor re: Re: Daniel E.

Imperfect alignment of prostate biopsy and Gleason score after radical prostatectomy (RP) may be a contributing factor.  Objective:   To develop a statistical model that predicts the post-RP Gleason score (pathologic Gleason score [PGS]) using clinical observations made in the course of AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   Repeated prostate-specific antigen measurements and biopsy Gleason scores from 964 very low-risk patients in the Johns Hopkins Active Surveillance cohort were used in the analysis. PGS observations from 191 patients who underwent RP were also included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A Bayesian joint model based on accumulated clinical data was used to predict PGS in these categories: 6 (grade group 1), 3+4 (grade group 2), 4+3 (grade group 3), and 8-10 (grade groups 4 and 5). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration of predictions was assessed in patients with post-RP Gleason score observations.  Results and limitations:   The estimated probability of harboring a PGS >6 was <20% for most patients who had not experienced grade reclassification or elected surgery. Among patients with post-RP Gleason score observations, the AUC for predictions of PGS >6 was 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.81), and the mean absolute error was 0.022.  Conclusions:   Although the model requires external validation prior to adoption, PGS predictions can be used in AS to inform decisions regarding follow-up biopsies and remaining on AS. Predictions can be updated as additional data are observed. The joint modeling framework also accommodates novel biomarkers as they are identified and measured on AS patients.  Patient summary:   Measurements taken in the course of active surveillance can be used to accurately predict patients' underlying prostate cancer status.

This study aimed to (1) characterize the content of tweets authored by the United States cancer patients; and (2) use patient tweets to compute the average happiness of cancer patients for each cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   A large sample of English tweets from March 2014 through December 2014 was obtained from Twitter. Using regular expression software pattern matching, the tweets were filtered by cancer diagnosis. For each cancer-specific tweetset, individual patients were extracted, and the content of the tweet was categorized. The patients' Twitter identification numbers were used to gather all tweets for each patient, and happiness values for patient tweets were calculated using a quantitative hedonometric analysis.  Results:   The most frequently tweeted cancers were breast (n = 15,421, 11% of total cancer tweets), lung (n = 2928, 2.0%), prostate (n = 1036, 0.7%), and colorectal (n = 773, 0.5%). Patient tweets pertained to the treatment course (n = 73, 26%), diagnosis (n = 65, 23%), and then surgery and/or biopsy (n = 42, 15%). Computed happiness values for each cancer diagnosis revealed higher average happiness values for thyroid (h_avg = 6.1625), breast (h_avg = 6.1485), and lymphoma (h_avg = 6.0977) cancers and lower average happiness values for pancreatic (h_avg = 5.8766), lung (h_avg = 5.8733), and kidney (h_avg = 5.8464) cancers.

Results:   The response rate to the ARAT agent in group A (63.6%) was significantly higher than those to the ARAT agent introduced late-line in groups B and C (20.6% and 29.6%, respectively). In addition, prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival during the ARAT therapy in group A was significantly superior to those during the ARAT therapy conducted late-line in groups B and C.

Sites studied are prostate, head and neck (HN), and rectal cancer treatments.  Methods:   The system compares measured cumulative transit EPID image frames with predicted cumulative image frames in real-time during treatment using a χ comparison with 4 %, 4 mm criteria. The treatment site-specific thresholds (prostate, HN and rectum IMRT) were determined using initial data collected from 137 patients (274 measured treatment fractions) and a statistical process control methodology. These thresholds were then applied to data from 15 selected patients including 5 prostate, 5 HN, and 5 rectum IMRT treatments for system evaluation and classification of error sources.  Results:   Clinical demonstration of real-time transit EPID dosimetry in IMRT was presented. For error simulation, the system could detect gross errors (i.e. wrong patient, wrong plan, wrong gantry angle) immediately after EPID stabilisation; 2 seconds after the start of treatment. The average rate of error detection was 7.0 % (prostate = 5.6 %, HN= 8.7 % and rectum = 6.7 %). The detected errors were classified as either clinical in origin (e.g. patient anatomical changes), or non-clinical in origin (e.g. detection system errors). Classified errors were 3.2 % clinical and 3.9 % non-clinical.  Conclusion:   An EPID-based real-time error detection method for treatment verification during dynamic IMRT has been developed and tested for its performance and limitations.

One major factor that drives this therapy is the ability to carefully control and prevent inadvertent damage to local tissues, while focusing therapeutic heating to specific regions of the tumor tissues. To this end, it is critical to generate efficient heating in the targeted tumors while monitoring the extent and distribution of heating. In our study, we demonstrated the photothermal heating properties of our synthesized branched Au nanoparticles (b-AuNPs) using non-invasive MR thermometry (MRT) techniques to assess its effects both in vitro and in vivo. 75 nm b-AuNPs were synthesized; these b-AuNPs demonstrated strong near infrared (NIR) absorption and high heat transducing efficiency. Proton resonance frequency MRT approaches for monitoring b-AuNPs mediated heating were validated using in vitro agar phantoms and further evaluated during in vivo animal model tumor ablation studies. In vitro phantom studies demonstrated a strong linear correlation between MRT and reference-standard thermocouple measurements of b-AuNPs-mediated heating upon NIR laser irradiation; temperatures increased with both an increase in laser power and increased exposure duration. Localized photothermal heating in regions containing the b-AuNPs was confirmed through MRT generated temperature maps acquired serially at increasing depths during both phantom and in vivo studies. Our results suggested that b-AuNPs exposed to NIR radiation produced highly efficient localized heating that can be accurately monitored dynamically using non-invasive MRT measurements. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Targeting microRNA (miRNA) has been considered as a therapeutic strategy against cancers. Human miR-204-5p potentially targeting BCL2 has been reported to be downregulated in various cancers. We hypothesized that miR-204-5p overexpression induces cancer cell apoptosis by repressing BCL2 expression.  Methods:   A vector harboring mature miR-204-5p was constructed and delivered into human PCa cells. The expression level of miR-204-5p was determined by miRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the function of mature miR-204-5p and its direct binding to BCL2 transcripts. The expression levels of BCL-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein samples were measured by QPCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell viability was detected by WST-1 assays. Induction of apoptosis was determined by increased levels of cleavage caspase 3 and caspase 3/7 activity.  Results:   The expression levels of miR-204-5p were downregulated in PCa cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells. Transfection of pSM-204 resulted in up to 6.2-fold higher expression of miR-204-5p when compared with pSM control. The mRNA levels of several potential target genes of miR-204-5p were decreased in pSM-204-transfected PC3 and Rv1 cells. BCL2 mRNA and protein expression decreased in miR-204-5p-transfected cells, which led to cytochrome C release from mitochondria. It subsequently increased cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 3/7 activities and reduced cell viability. Cotransfection of a reporter vector harboring the BCL2 3'-untranslated region to compete with endogenous transcripts partially rescued miR-204-5p-induced apoptosis.  Conclusion:   Human miR-204-5p targets BCL2 in PCa cells.

We determined which single comorbid conditions are independently associated with competing mortality after radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy in order to develop a mortality index.  Methods:   The study samples consisted of 2,961 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2007 for clinically localized prostate cancer and 932 consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 1993 and 2012 for high-risk non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive urothelial or undifferentiated bladder cancer. Competing mortality was the study endpoint. Proportional hazard models for the subdistribution of competing risks were used for analysis.  Results:   Age, angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe renal disease, current smoking, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class 3 to 4 were independent predictors of competing mortality after radical prostatectomy. After identifying radical cystectomy, age, angina pectoris, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, ASA class 3 to 4, and male sex as independent predictors of competing mortality, a combined mortality index using the conditions independently associated with competing mortality in both samples stratified the patients into risk groups with 0% 10-year competing mortality in the lowest and approximately 50% in the highest-risk classes.

Gay/bisexual men have different social networks and unique social support needs, particularly as it pertains to health care access and prostate side effects. Few studies have investigated the availability and provision of social support for gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer (GBMPCa).  Methods:   This study used qualitative data from in-depth, semistructured, one-on-one telephone interviews with 30 GBMPCa recruited from a national cancer support group network, Malecare. Inductive and deductive codes were used to identify themes about social support provided to GBMPCa during diagnosis and treatment.  Results:   GBMPCa reported help from friends, family (parents and siblings), ex-partners, and paid caregivers. Men in relationships reported varying levels of reliance on their partners for support, in part due to relationship dynamics and living arrangements. Single men showed a theme of independence (""I turned down all help,"" ""My friends don't want to be bothered""). After diagnosis, many men reported seeking informational and emotional support from prostate cancer support groups; most expressed wanting more support groups specifically for GBMPCa. During or after treatment, men reported receiving a range of instrumental support, largely a function of relationship status and treatment type.  Conclusions:   GBMPCa received variable, but generally low, social support during diagnosis and treatment and from a diverse social network, including a prominence of friends and family.

Potential black/white disparities in cancer incidence, stage, and survival among the oldest old (≥85 years) were examined using data from the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute.  Methods:   Differences in cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis were examined for cases diagnosed within the most recent 5-year period, and changes in these differences over time were examined for white and black cases aged ≥85 years. Five-year relative cancer survival rate was also examined by race.  Results:   Among those aged ≥85 years, black men had higher colorectal, lung and bronchus, and prostate cancer incidence rates than white men, respectively. From 1973 to 2012, lung and bronchus and female breast cancer incidence increased, while colorectal and prostate cancer incidence decreased among this population. Blacks had higher rates of unstaged cancer compared with whites. The 5-year relative survival rate for all invasive cancers combined was higher for whites than blacks. Notably, whites had more than three times the relative survival rate of lung and bronchus cancer when diagnosed at localized (35.1% vs. 11.6%) and regional (12.2% vs. 3.2%) stages than blacks, respectively.

Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs play critical roles in prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis and have potential use as therapeutic targets. Although dysregulated miR-132/212 have been suggested to be directly involved in the proliferation and invasion of multiple malignancies, the exact role of miR-132/212 in PCa has not yet been fully understood.  Methods:   Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and bioinformatics analysis were used to validate the expression levels of miR-132/212 in PCa cell lines as well as in prostatic tissues. The biological function of miR-132/212 was evaluated by MTS, transwell, and wound healing assays, respectively. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to study the transcript and protein expression levels. Bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to identify the molecular target of miR-132/212. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of SOX4.  Results:   miR-132 and miR-212 from the same gene cluster are downregulated in human PCa tissues when compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (both P < 0.05). Functionally, upregulation of miR-132/212 inhibits the migration and invasive capacity of Vcap and Lncap cells by wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. Notably, overexpression of miR-132/212 could inhibit TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-induced EMT in Vcap and Lncap cells at both the mRNA and protein expression levels. SOX4 gene, an important EMT regulator of PCa, was identified as the target of miR-132/212 by bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assay. Clinically, miR-132/212 expression levels were adversely correlated with Gleason score (P < 0.001) and SOX4 expression by IHC and RT-qPCR in PCa tissues.

These N-terminal binding agents induce a heat shock response that activates compensatory heat shock proteins, which is believed to contribute in part to the agents' lack of efficacy. Here, we describe the functional characterization of two novel agents, SM253 and SM258, that bind the N-middle linker region of Hsp90, resulting in reduced client protein activation and preventing C-terminal co-chaperones and client proteins from binding to Hsp90.  Methods:   Inhibition of Hsp90 activity in prostate cancer cells by SM253 and SM 258 was assessed by pull-down assays. Cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were assayed in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3) cultured with N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors (AUY922, 17-AAG), SM253 or SM258. Expression of HSR heat shock proteins, Hsp90 client proteins and co-chaperones was assessed by immunoblotting. Efficacy of the SM compounds was evaluated in human primary prostate tumors cultured ex vivo by immunohistochemical detection of Hsp70 and Ki67.  Results:   SM253 and SM258 exhibit antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in multiple prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3) at low micromolar concentrations. Unlike the N-terminal inhibitors AUY922 and 17-AAG, these SM agents do not induce expression of Hsp27, Hsp40, or Hsp70, proteins that are characteristic of the heat shock response, in any of the prostate cell lines analyzed. Notably, SM258 significantly reduced proliferation within 2 days in human primary prostate tumors cultured ex vivo, without the significant induction of Hsp70 that was caused by AUY922 in the tissues.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide the first evidence of efficacy of this class of C-terminal modulators of Hsp90 in human prostate tumors, and indicate that further evaluation of these promising new agents is warranted.

These factors regulate tumor cell survival and proliferation, and remain as crucial drivers of castration-resistant PCa progression. Icaritin (ICT) is a prenyl flavonoid derived from the Epimedium genus, which has many biological and pharmacological effects. Using androgen-sensitive human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cell lines, we found that 35 μg/ml of ICT could inhibit more than 50% of cell proliferation, induce cell apoptosis, and lead to a strong G1 phase arrest by targeting cyclin-related proteins and suppressing the ability of cell invasion. Moreover, ICT exerts its potent anticancer efficacy by inducing polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (PEA3) to inhibit the aberrantly activated HER2/AR signaling. In addition, after PEA3 expression was silenced by specific small-interference RNA, we found that both the ICT-inhibited effect on LNCaP cell proliferation and the ICT-induced cell apoptosis rate decreased.

However, resistance to taxanes is common. Our objective was to investigate mechanisms of taxane resistance in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two docetaxel-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of CRPC were established (PC339-DOC and PC346C-DOC) in male athymic nude mice by frequent intraperitoneal administrations of docetaxel. Next-generation sequencing was performed on PDX tissue pre- and post-docetaxel resistance and gene expression profiles were compared. [(14)C]-docetaxel and [(14)C]-cabazitaxel uptake assays in vitro and cytotoxicity assays were performed to validate direct involvement of transporter genes in taxane sensitivity.  Results:   Organic anion-transporting polypeptide (SLCO1B3), an influx transporter of docetaxel, was significantly downregulated in PC346C-DOC tumours. In accordance with this finding, intratumoural concentrations of docetaxel and cabazitaxel were significantly decreased in PC346C-DOC as compared with levels in chemotherapy-naive PC346C tumours. In addition, silencing of SLCO1B3 in chemo-naive PC346C resulted in a two-fold decrease in intracellular concentrations of both taxanes. Overexpression of SLCO1B3 showed higher sensitivity to docetaxel and cabazitaxel.

Previous studies have revealed that overexpression of PLAGL2 is associated with many human cancers. However, it has been reported that PLAGL2 also plays as a tumor suppressor. The precise role of PLAGL2 in prostate cancer (PCa) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of PLAGL2 in PCa. Data from microarray datasets demonstrated that the DNA copy number and mRNA level of PLAGL2 were significantly increased in PCa compared with normal prostate. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis from paired PCa samples and prostate cell lines confirmed upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels in PCa. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that staining of PLAGL2 in PCa tissues was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. In addition, the high expression of PLAGL2 was only involved in preoperative PSA, but was not related to age, Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin status, clinical stage and positive lymph node metastasis. Moreover, our results showed that PLAGL2 was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) of PCa patients, and overexpressed PLAGL2 was related to early development of BCR and poor OS. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PLAGL2 is overexpressed in PCa.

However, nanobubbles (NBs) have better stability and stronger penetration than microbubbles, and drug delivery assisted by US-targeted NB destruction (UTND) still needs to be investigated. Our aim was to investigate the effect of doxorubicin (DOX) on the inhibition of prostate cancer growth under UTND. Contrast-enhanced US imaging of transplanted PC3 prostate cancer in mice showed that under a combination of 1 W/cm(2) US power and a 100 Hz intermittent pulse with a ""5 seconds on, 5 seconds off"" mode, NBs with an average size of (485.7±33) nm were effectively destroyed within 15 minutes in the tumor location. PC3 cells and 20 tumor-bearing mice were divided into four groups: a DOX group, a DOX + NB group, a DOX + US group, and a DOX + NB + US group. The cell growth-inhibition rate and DOX concentration of xenografts in the DOX + NB + US group were highest. Based on another control group and these four groups, another 25 tumor-bearing mice were used to observe the treatment effect of nine DOX injections under UTND. The xenografts in the DOX + NB + US group decreased more obviously and had more cellular apoptosis than other groups. Finally, electron microscopy was used to estimate the cavitation effect of NBs under US irradiation in the control group, NB group, US group, and NB + US group. The results of scanning electron microscopy showed that PC3 cells in the DOX + NB + US group had more holes and significantly increased cell-surface folds. Meanwhile, transmission electric microscopy confirmed that more lanthanum nitrate particles entered the parenchymal cells in xenografts in the NB + US group compared with the other groups. This study suggested that UTND technology could be an effective method to promote drugs to function in US-irradiated sites, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with a cavitation effect.""","""['Xiaozhou Fan', 'Luofu Wang', 'Yanli Guo', 'Xingyu Xiong', 'Lianhua Zhu', 'Kejing Fang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Effectiveness of localized ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction with doxorubicin liposomes in H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma model.', 'Preparation Of Nanobubbles Modified With A Small-Molecule CXCR4 Antagonist For Targeted Drug Delivery To Tumors And Enhanced Ultrasound Molecular Imaging.', 'Doxorubicin nanobubble for combining ultrasonography and targeted chemotherapy of rabbit with VX2 liver tumor.', 'Nano-lipospheres as acoustically active ultrasound contrast agents: evolving tumor imaging and therapy technique.', 'A comprehensive update of micro- and nanobubbles as theranostics in oncology.', 'Development of an Antibody Delivery Method for Cancer Treatment by Combining Ultrasound with Therapeutic Antibody-Modified Nanobubbles Using Fc-Binding Polypeptide.', 'Construction and validation of a prognostic marker and risk model for HCC ultrasound therapy combined with WGCNA identification.', 'ICAM-1-carrying targeted nano contrast agent for evaluating inflammatory injury in rabbits with atherosclerosis.', 'Nanovectorization of Prostate Cancer Treatment Strategies: A New Approach to Improved Outcomes.', 'Ultrasound-Responsive Nanocarriers in Cancer Treatment: A Review.']"""

Deregulation of ANK3 expression has been observed in multiple human cancers but its mechanism remains unknown. ANK3 expression in relation to disease progression and patients' outcome was investigated in two cohorts of prostate cancer (PCA). Mechanistic studies were carried out in vitro and in vivo using several PCA cell lines and the avian embryo model. Silencing ANK3 resulted in significant reduction of cell proliferation through an AR-independent mechanism. Decreased ANK3 expression delayed S phase to G2/M cell cycle transition and reduced the expression of cyclins A and B. However, cells with knocked-down ANK3 exhibited significant increase in cell invasion through an AR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we found that ANK3 is a regulator of AR protein stability. ANK3 knockdown also promoted cancer cell invasion and extravasations in vivo using the avian embryo model (p < 0.01). In human samples, ANK3 expression was dramatically upregulated in high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and localized PCA (p < 0.0001). However, it was downregulated castration resistant stage (p < 0.0001) and showed inverse relation to Gleason score (p < 0.0001). In addition, increased expression of ANK3 in cancer tissues was correlated with better cancer-specific survival of PCA patients (p = 0.012).

Objective:   To assess patterns of physician ordering of services that tend to be overused in the treatment of patients with cancer. We hypothesized that physicians exhibit consistent behavior.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective study of patients 66 years and older diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2011, using population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to assess physician-level variation in 5 nonrecommended services. Services included imaging for staging and surveillance in low-risk disease, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery, and extended fractionation schemes for palliation of bone metastases.  Main outcome and measures:   To assess variation in service use between physicians, we used a random effects model and a logistic regression model with a lag variable to assess whether a physician's use of a service for a prior patient predicts subsequent service use.  Results:   Cohorts ranged from 3464 to 89 006 patients. The total proportion of patients receiving each service varied from 14% for imaging in staging early breast cancer to 41% in early prostate cancer. From the random effects analysis, we found significant unexplained variation in service use between physicians (P < .001 for each service; ICC, 0.04-0.59). Controlling for case mix, whether a physician ordered a service for the prior patient was highly predictive of service use, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) ranging from 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.18) for surveillance imaging for patients with breast cancer (28% service use if prior patient had imaging vs 25% if not), to 24.91 (95% CI, 22.86-27.15) for IMRT for whole breast radiotherapy (69% vs 7%, respectively).

At 5-10 nm, KLK14 converts pro-HGF to the two-chain heterodimer required for Met activation, while higher concentrations degrade the HGF α-chain.

Here, we analyzed silibinin (a natural flavonoid) efficacy to target cell growth, angiogenesis, and metabolic changes in human PCa, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells under hypoxic condition. Silibinin treatment inhibited the proliferation, clonogenicity, and endothelial cells tube formation by hypoxic (1% O2 ) PCa cells. Interestingly, hypoxia promoted a lipogenic phenotype in PCa cells via activating acetyl-Co A carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) that was inhibited by silibinin treatment. Importantly, silibinin treatment strongly decreased hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression in PCa cells together with a strong reduction in hypoxia-induced NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity. HIF-1α overexpression in LNCaP cells significantly increased the lipid accumulation and NOX activity; however, silibinin treatment reduced HIF-1α expression, lipid levels, clonogenicity, and NOX activity even in HIF-1α overexpressing LNCaP cells. In vivo, silibinin feeding (200 mg/kg body weight) to male nude mice with 22Rv1 tumors, specifically inhibited tumor vascularity (measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) resulting in tumor growth inhibition without directly inducing necrosis (as revealed by diffusion-weighted MRI). Silibinin feeding did not significantly affect tumor glucose uptake measured by FDG-PET; however, reduced the lipid synthesis measured by quantitative 1 H-NMR metabolomics. IHC analyses of tumor tissues confirmed that silibinin feeding decreased proliferation and angiogenesis as well as reduced HIF-1α, FASN, and ACC levels.

Chromosome 6p contains several members of the B7 family of immune regulator genes, including butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2; OMIM, 606000), which is associated with prostate cancer risk and autoimmune diseases.  Objective:   To investigate the expression and variant allele frequencies of BTNL2, a candidate gene for chromosome 6 amplification, in patients with UM.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this case-control study, we analyzed the expression of BTNL2 in UM cell lines and human macrophages in patients with UM. Variants of BTNL2 were analyzed using probes for polymerase chain reaction and high-resolution melting. The association of missense variants rs28362679 and rs41441651 with tumor risk was analyzed in 209 patients with UM and 116 matched control patients as well as 12 UM and 64 other tumor cell lines. Genes that were differentially expressed in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages were identified by microarray analysis of 111 patients with UM, and the association of the expression of these genes with disease-free survival was analyzed by Cox regression analysis. Data were collected from September 2013 to November 2015.  Main outcomes and measures:   Butyrophilin-like 2 single-nucleotide variants were associated with UM risk; M1 and M2 macrophage-specific gene expression was associated with disease-free survival.  Results:   We genotyped a total of 325 patients. Of the 209 patients with UM, 124 (59.3%) were male, 114 (54.5%) were Italian, and 95 (45.5%) were German; the mean (range) age was 65 (27-94) years. Of the 116 Italian control patients, 67 (57.8%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 39 (21-88) years. Butyrophilin-like 2 is expressed in patients with UM and macrophages. The frequency of the rs28362679 variant was higher in patients with UM (16 of 209 [7.7%]; 95% CI, 4.7-12.2) than frequencies from European Variation Archive and Exome Aggregation Consortium data (2134 of 118 564 [1.8%]; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9) and Exome Sequencing Project data (100 of 4540 [2.2%]; 95% CI, 1.8-2.7) but were not higher compared with Italian control patients (10 of 116 [8.6%]; 95% CI, 4.6-15.4). The rs41441651 variant was present in 5 patients with UM (2.4%; 95% CI, 0.9-5.7), 2 Italian control patients (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.1-6.5), 2846 patients from European Variation Archive and Exome Aggregation Consortium data (2.4%; 95% CI, 2.3-2.5), and 23 patients from Exome Sequencing Project data (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Human UM cells express M1 and M2 macrophage-specific genes, whose expression is associated with disease-free survival.  Conclusions and relevance:   Butyrophilin-like 2, expressed at various levels by UM cells and macrophages, might interfere with the immune control of the tumor. Butyrophilin-like 2 variants showed highly variable frequencies among ethnically related cohorts.

The objective of this work was to quantify the contribution of the founder mutations BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu and BRCA1 c.3331_3334del for cancer etiology in unselected hospital-based cohorts of Portuguese patients diagnosed with these rarer cancers, by using a strategy that included testing of archival tumor tissue. A total of 102 male breast, 68 pancreatic and 33 peritoneal/fallopian tube carcinoma cases were included in the study. The BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu mutation was observed with a frequency of 7.8% in male breast cancers, 3.0% in peritoneal/fallopian tube cancers, and 1.6% in pancreatic cancers, with estimated total contributions of germline BRCA2 mutations of 14.3%, 5.5%, and 2.8%, respectively. No carriers of the BRCA1 c.3331_3334del mutation were identified. During our study, a patient with an ampulla of Vater carcinoma was incidentally found to carry the BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu mutation, so we decided to test a consecutive series of additional 15 ampullary carcinomas for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations using a combination of direct founder mutation testing and full gene analysis with next generation sequencing. BRCA2 mutations were observed with a frequency of 14.3% in ampulla of Vater carcinomas. In conclusion, taking into account the implications for both the individuals and their family members, we recommend that patients with these neoplasias should be offered BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing and we here show that it is feasible to test for founder mutations in archival tumor tissue. Furthermore, we identified for the first time a high frequency of germline BRCA2 mutations in ampullary cancers.""","""['Pedro Pinto', 'Ana Peixoto', 'Catarina Santos', 'Patrícia Rocha', 'Carla Pinto', 'Manuela Pinheiro', 'Luís Leça', 'Ana Teresa Martins', 'Verónica Ferreira', 'Carla Bartosch', 'Manuel R Teixeira']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in males with familial breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

Methods:   We used the cost of illness methodology, through the assessment of the direct and indirect costs associated with cancer treatment. Data was obtained from 2009 registries of the Chilean Ministry of Health and the Superintendence of Health. Indirect costs were calculated by days of job absenteeism and potential years of life lost.  Results:   Over US$ 2.1 billion were spent on cancer in 2009, which represents almost 1% of Chiles Gross Domestic Product. The direct per capita cost was US$ 47. Indirect costs were 1.92 times more than direct costs. The three types of cancer that embody the highest share of costs were gastric cancer (17.6%), breast cancer (7%) and prostate cancer (4.2%) in the public sector, and breast cancer (14%), lung cancer (7.5%) and prostate cancer (4.1%) in the private sector. On average men spent 30.33% more than women.  Conclusion:   There are few studies of this kind in Chile and the region. The country can be classified as having a cancer economic impact below the average of those in European Union countries. We expect that this information can be used to develop access policies and resource allocation decision making, and as a first step into further cancer-costing studies in Chile and the Latin American and Caribbean region.""","""['Camilo Cid', 'Cristian Herrera', 'Rodrigo Rodríguez', 'Gabriel Bastías', 'Jorge Jiménez']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Medwave""","""['Economic burden of cancer across the European Union: a population-based cost analysis.', 'Integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess wintertime illness-related absenteeism and its direct and indirect costs among the private sector in Ulaanbaatar.', 'The cost of dementia in an unequal country: The case of Chile.', 'Cost of lost productivity in pharmacoeconomics analysis.

Percentages were used for the descriptive analysis.  Results:   Eighty-five surveys were conducted at the Institute of Oncology and Radiobiology of Cuba.

To investigate mechanisms by which the tumor can synthesize its own androgens and develop resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, methods to measure a complete androgen profile are imperative. Here, we report the development and validation of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (SID-LC-ESI-MS/MS) method to quantify nine human hydroxy-androgens as picolinates, simultaneously with requisite specificity and sensitivity. In the established method, the fragmentation patterns of all nine hydroxy-androgen picolinates were identified, and [13C3]-5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol and [13C3]-5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol used as internal standards were synthesized enzymatically. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy corresponds to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Criteria for Bioanalytical Method Validation. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of nine hydroxy-androgens is 1.0pg to 2.5pg on column. Diols which have been infrequently measured: 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol and 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol can be determined in serum at values as low as 1.0pg on column. The method also permits the quantitation of conjugated hydroxy-androgens following enzymatic digestion. While direct detection of steroid conjugates by electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry has advantages the detection of unconjugated and conjugated steroids would require separate methods for each set of analytes. Our method was applied to pooled serum from male and female donors to provide reference values for both unconjugated and conjugated hydroxy-androgens. This method will allow us to interrogate the involvement of the conversion of 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol to T, the backdoor pathway involving the conversion of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to DHT and the inactivation of DHT to 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Tianzhu Zang', 'Daniel Tamae', 'Clementina Mesaros', 'Qingqing Wang', 'Meng Huang', 'Ian A Blair', 'Trevor M Penning']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Simultaneous measurement of 18 steroids in human and mouse serum by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry without derivatization to profile the classical and alternate pathways of androgen synthesis and metabolism.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Development, validation and application of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization/selected reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (SID-LC/ESI/SRM/MS) method for quantification of keto-androgens in human serum.', 'Testicular vs adrenal sources of hydroxy-androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Conversion of Classical and 11-Oxygenated Androgens by Insulin-Induced AKR1C3 in a Model of Human PCOS Adipocytes.', 'Simultaneous measurement of 18 steroids in human and mouse serum by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry without derivatization to profile the classical and alternate pathways of androgen synthesis and metabolism.', 'Derivatization with 2-hydrazino-1-methylpyridine enhances sensitivity of analysis of 5α-dihydrotestosterone in human plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Human and murine steroid 5β-reductases (AKR1D1 and AKR1D4): insights into the role of the catalytic glutamic acid.', 'The Divergent Function of Androgen Receptor in Breast Cancer; Analysis of Steroid Mediators and Tumor Intracrinology.']"""

Although some studies investigate DR after treatment for localised prostate cancer, none report DR in patients undergoing surgery and post-prostatectomy radiotherapy. We evaluated DR in this group of patients overall, and for specific components of therapy.  Methods:   We surveyed 83 patients, with minimum 5 years follow-up, treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) and post-prostatectomy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) to 64-66 Gy following www.EviQ.org.au protocols. A validated questionnaire identified DR if men either indicated that they would have been better off had they chosen another treatment, or they wished they could change their mind about treatment.  Results:   There was an 85.5% response rate, with median follow-up post-IMRT 78 months. Adjuvant IG-IMRT was used in 28% of patients, salvage in 72% and ADT in 48%. A total of 70% of patients remained disease-free. Overall, 16.9% of patients expressed DR for treatment, with fourfold more regret for the RP component of treatment compared to radiotherapy (16.9% vs 4.2%, P = 0.01). DR for androgen deprivation was 14.3%. Patients were regretful of surgery due to toxicity, not being adequately informed about radiotherapy as an alternative, positive margins and surgery costs (83%, 33%, 25% and 8% of regretful patients respectively). Toxicity caused DR in the three radiotherapy-regretful and four ADT-regretful patients. Patients were twice as regretful overall, and of surgery, for salvage vs adjuvant approaches (both 19.6% vs 10.0%).  Conclusion:   Decision regret after RP and post-prostatectomy IG-IMRT is uncommon, although patients regret RP more than post-operative IG-IMRT. This should reassure urologists referring patients for post-prostatectomy IG-IMRT, particularly in the immediate adjuvant setting. Other implications include appropriate patient selection for RP (and obtaining clear margins), and ensuring adequately discussing definitive radiotherapy as an alternative to surgery.""","""['Thomas P Shakespeare', 'Stephen Chin', 'Lucy Manuel', 'Shelly Wen', 'Matthew Hoffman', 'Shea W Wilcox', 'Noel J Aherne']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Decision regret in men undergoing dose-escalated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Toxicity after post-prostatectomy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy using Australian guidelines.', ""Exploring Value From the Patient's Perspective Between Modern Radiation Therapy Modalities for Localized Prostate Cancer."", 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting: What is the evidence so far?', 'Patients Regret Their Choice of Therapy Significantly Less Frequently after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy as Opposed to Open Radical Prostatectomy: Patient-Reported Results of the Multicenter Cross-Sectional IMPROVE Study.', 'Bone health assessment with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in men with high-risk prostate carcinoma commencing adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Evidence of depression-associated circadian rhythm disruption and regret in prostate cancer patients after surgery.']"""

Thanks to recent advances in sequencing technologies, 'liquid biopsy', the sampling of patient's bodily fluids such as blood and urine, is considered as one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal. In many cancer patients, and especially those with advanced metastatic disease, deep sequencing of circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from patient's blood yields a mixture of reads originating from the normal DNA and from multiple tumour subclones-called circulating tumour DNA or ctDNA. The ctDNA/cfDNA ratio as well as the proportion of ctDNA originating from specific tumour subclones depend on multiple factors, making comprehensive detection of mutations difficult, especially at early stages of cancer. Furthermore, sensitive and accurate detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels from cfDNA is constrained by several factors such as the sequencing errors and PCR artifacts, and mapping errors related to repeat regions within the genome. In this article, we introduce SiNVICT, a computational method that increases the sensitivity and specificity of SNV and indel detection at very low variant allele frequencies. SiNVICT has the capability to handle multiple sequencing platforms with different error properties; it minimizes false positives resulting from mapping errors and other technology specific artifacts including strand bias and low base quality at read ends. SiNVICT also has the capability to perform time-series analysis, where samples from a patient sequenced at multiple time points are jointly examined to report locations of interest where there is a possibility that certain clones were wiped out by some treatment while some subclones gained selective advantage.  Results:   We tested SiNVICT on simulated data as well as prostate cancer cell lines and cfDNA obtained from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. On both simulated and biological data, SiNVICT was able to detect SNVs and indels with variant allele percentages as low as 0.5%. The lowest amounts of total DNA used for the biological data where SNVs and indels could be detected with very high sensitivity were 2.5 ng on the Ion Torrent platform and 10 ng on Illumina. With increased sequencing and mapping accuracy, SiNVICT might be utilized in clinical settings, making it possible to track the progress of point mutations and indels that are associated with resistance to cancer therapies and provide patients personalized treatment. We also compared SiNVICT with other popular SNV callers such as MuTect, VarScan2 and Freebayes. Our results show that SiNVICT performs better than these tools in most cases and allows further data exploration such as time-series analysis on cfDNA sequencing data.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the preoperative physical activity level and subsequent postoperative complications, sick-leave and hospital stay after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the setting of the LAPPRO trial (LAParoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open).  Methods:   LAPPRO is a prospective controlled trial, comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic and open surgery for localized prostate cancer between 2008 and 2011. 1569 patients aged 64 or less with an occupation were included in this sub-study. The Gleason score was <7 in 52 % of the patients. Demographics and the level of self-assessed preoperative physical activity, length of hospital stay, complications, quality of life, recovery and sick-leave were extracted from clinical record forms and questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression, with log-link and logit-link functions, was used to adjust for potential confounding variables.  Results:   The patients were divided into four groups based on their level of activity. As the group with lowest engagement of physical activity was found to be significantly different in base line characteristics from the other groups they were excluded from further analysis. Among patients that were physically active preoperativelly (n = 1467) there was no significant difference between the physical activity-groups regarding hospital stay, recovery or complications. However, in the group with the highest self-assessed level of physical activity, 5-7 times per week, 13 % required no sick leave, compared to 6.3 % in the group with a physical activity level of 1-2 times per week only (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   In our study of med operated with radical prostatectomy, a high level of physical activity preoperatively was associated with reduced need for sick leave after radical prostatectomy compared to men with lower physical activity.

Furthermore, different regions in the United States may be more negatively impacted due to higher population growth rates. The state of Florida witnessed over a 10% higher growth rate compared with national figures between 2000 and 2015. Coupled with data suggesting that since the 1980s, the number of U.S. urologists per capita has been decreasing, the foreseeable future presents many challenges regarding health equity and accessibility. This secondary analysis aimed to investigate the implications of forecasted urologic care decline within a growing population and how it can contribute to adverse male health outcomes. National- and state-level data were collected to calculate a series of urologic care ratios as defined by the number of urologists compared with population sizes. Analyses revealed that national-level urologic care ratios and prostate cancer incidence rates have a significant positive relationship, lending to the conclusion that with fewer urologists, the number of cases identified will decrease. State-level forecasted models indicated that the urologic care ratio will decrease approximately 30% in Florida from 6.23 per 100,000 in 2010 to 4.39 per 100,000 by the year 2030. As growth in demand for urologic care will increase in the next decade, a dire public health scenario is potentially unfolding.

Ten day before SPBx, all patients underwent 3.0 T pelvic mpMRI (Achieva 3T; Philips Healthcare Best, Netherlands). In the presence of mpMRI lesions suggestive of cancer (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] score 4/5), targeted mpMRI/TRUS TR fusion guided biopsies (4 cores) and TP cognitive biopsies (4 cores) were added to SPBx.

Treatment regret is associated with lower physical and mental quality of life. We investigated whether, in men with prostate cancer, spirituality is associated with lower decisional regret 6 months after treatment and whether this is, in part, because men with stronger spiritual beliefs experience lower decisional conflict when they are deciding how to treat their cancer.  Methods:   One thousand ninety three patients with prostate cancer (84% white, 10% black, and 6% Hispanic; mean age = 63.18; SD = 7.75) completed measures of spiritual beliefs and decisional conflict after diagnosis and decisional regret 6 months after treatment. We used multivariable linear regression to test whether there is an association between spirituality and decisional regret and structural equation modeling to test whether decisional conflict mediated this relationship.  Results:   Stronger spiritual beliefs were associated with less decisional regret (b = -0.39, 95% CI = -0.53, -0.26, P < .001, partial η2 = 0.024, confidence interval = -0.55, 39%, P < .001, partial η2 = 0.03), after controlling for covariates.

The efficacy of group interventions for reducing psychological morbidity is lacking. This study investigated the relative benefits of a group nurse-led intervention on psychological morbidity, unmet needs, treatment-related concerns and prostate cancer-specific quality of life in men receiving curative intent radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   This phase III, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial included 331 men (consent rate: 72 %; attrition: 5 %) randomised to the intervention (n = 166) or usual care (n = 165). The intervention comprised four group and one individual consultation all delivered by specialist uro-oncology nurses. Primary outcomes were anxious and depressive symptoms as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Unmet needs were assessed with the Supportive Care Needs Survey-SF34 Revised, treatment-related concerns with the Cancer Treatment Scale and quality of life with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index -26. Assessments occurred before, at the end of and 6 months post-radiotherapy. Primary outcome analysis was by intention-to-treat and performed by fitting a linear mixed model to each outcome separately using all observed data.  Results:   Mixed models analysis indicated that group consultations had a significant beneficial effect on one of two primary endpoints, depressive symptoms (p = 0.009), and one of twelve secondary endpoints, procedural concerns related to cancer treatment (p = 0.049). Group consultations did not have a significant beneficial effect on generalised anxiety, unmet needs and prostate cancer-specific quality of life.

Several studies had proposed intratumoral heterogeneity of these fusions. This study was designed to determine frequency and extent of ERG fusion heterogeneity in early-onset prostate cancer (EO-PCA, <50 years) and in elderly patients.  Methods:   The prostates from 63 EO-PCA and 62 elderly prostate cancer patients were thoroughly reviewed for presence of cancer foci. All 1592 tumor-containing sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for ERG expression.  Results:   The prostates included in this study contained one tumor focus in 44, two tumor foci in 21, three tumor foci in 32, four tumor foci in 15, and five or more tumor foci in 13 patients. Among 59 cancer foci with ≤3 mm, 19 (32.2 %) were homogeneously ERG positive, 39 66.1 %) were homogeneously ERG negative, and one case (1.7 %) showed a heterogeneous ERG status. The fraction of homogeneously ERG positive cancer foci remained largely constant (14-37 %) with increasing tumor focus diameter but the fraction of heterogeneous ERG findings continuously increased with tumor size and reached 39 % in cancer foci larger than 22 mm. On a patient level, ERG expression was markedly more frequent in EO-PCA than in elderly patients: 13 % of EO-PCA were homogeneously and 62 % were heterogeneously ERG positive. In elderly patients, 3 % of cancers were homogeneously and 57 % were heterogeneously ERG positive (p = 0.0721).  Conclusion:   These data show that about 20-30 % of prostate cancer foci have early ERG fusions. ERG fusions further occur in about 50 % of initially ERG negative cancer foci during cancer progression.

We investigated the utilization and factors associated with the omission of ADT in radiation-managed high-risk PCa.  Methods and materials:   We used the National Cancer Database to identify men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk PCa treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without brachytherapy boost from 2004 to 2012. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors was used to identify independent predictors for ADT use.  Results:   A total of 57,968 radiation-treated high-risk PCa men were included in our analysis. There were 49,363 patients (85.2%) treated with EBRT alone and 8605 patients (14.8%) treated with EBRT plus brachytherapy boost. Overall, 77% of men received ADT. In multivariable regression analysis, the use of brachytherapy boost was associated with a significantly lower utilization of ADT (70% vs. 78%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.62-0.69; p-Value <0.0001), as was treatment at an academic vs. nonacademic center (AOR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.86-0.95; p-Value <0.0001) and treatment in 2010-2012 compared to 2004-2006 (AOR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.81-0.90; p-Value <0.0001). Conversely, greater ADT use was seen with higher Gleason scores, PSA, and T-category (all p-Values <0.001).  Conclusions:   Approximately one in four men with radiation-managed high-risk PCa do not receive ADT, which may reflect concerns about its toxicity profile despite known improvements in overall survival. Practice patterns suggest that some providers believe dose escalation through brachytherapy boost may obviate the need for ADT in some high-risk patients, but this hypothesis requires further testing.""","""['Yu-Wei Chen', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Michelle D Nezolosky', 'Clair J Beard', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Neil E Martin', 'Peter F Orio', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['National Trends and Predictors of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Variations in patterns of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy use based on dose escalation with external beam radiotherapy vs. brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer.', 'Lack of Apparent Survival Benefit With Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer Receiving Combined External Beam Radiation Therapy and Brachytherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Variation in the Prescription of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy in the Netherlands, and Adherence to European Association of Urology Guidelines: A Population-based Study.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'Suboptimal use of hormonal therapy among German men with localized high-risk prostate Cancer during 2005 to 2015: analysis of registry data.', 'Addition of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy or Brachytherapy Boost to External Beam Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism of PC remains unclear. Numerous studies have demonstrated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can act as microRNA (miRNA) sponge, one type of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which offers a novel viewpoint to elucidate the mechanisms of PC. Here, we proposed an integrative systems biology approach to infer the gain and loss of ceRNAs in PC. First, we re-annotated exon microarray data to obtain lncRNA expression profiles of PC. Second, by integrating mRNA and miRNA expression, as well as miRNA targets, we constructed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks in cancer and normal samples. The lncRNAs in these two ceRNA networks tended to have a longer transcript length and cover more exons than the lncRNAs not involved in ceRNA networks. Next, we further extracted the gain and loss ceRNA networks in PC. We found that the gain ceRNAs in PC participated in cell cycle, and the loss ceRNAs in PC were associated with metabolism. We also identified potential prognostic ceRNA pairs such as MALAT1-EGR2 and MEG3-AQP3. Finally, we inferred a novel mechanism of known drugs, such as cisplatin, for the treatment of PC through gain and loss ceRNA networks. The potential drugs such as 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (TGGP) could modulate lncRNA-mRNA competing relationships, which may uncover new strategy for treating PC. In summary, we systematically investigated the gain and loss of ceRNAs in PC, which may prove useful for identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutics for PC.""","""['Dianming Liu', 'Xuexin Yu', 'Shuyuan Wang', 'Enyu Dai', 'Leiming Jiang', 'Jing Wang', 'Qian Yang', 'Feng Yang', 'Shunheng Zhou', 'Wei Jiang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Construction and analysis of dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network identified novel lncRNA biomarkers for early diagnosis of human pancreatic cancer.', 'Comprehensive characterization of lncRNA-mRNA related ceRNA network across 12 major cancers.', 'Systematic analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA network identifies four-lncRNA signature as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.', 'Roles of competing endogenous RNAs in gastric cancer.', 'Insight into long noncoding competing endogenous RNA networks in hepatic fibrosis: The potential implications for mechanism and therapy.', 'Hotair promotes the migration and proliferation in ovarian cancer by miR-222-3p/CDK19 axis.', 'Identification of a Prognostic Signature Composed of GPI, IL22RA1, CCT6A and SPOCK1 for Lung Adenocarcinoma Based on Bioinformatic Analysis of lncRNA-Mediated ceRNA Network and Sample Validation.', 'LncRNACASC9 promotes proliferation, metastasis, and cell cycle inovarian carcinoma cells through cyclinG1/TP53/MMP7 signaling.', 'H3K4me3-Mediated Upregulation of LncRNA-HEIPP in Preeclampsia Placenta Affects Invasion of Trophoblast Cells.', 'Systematic Evaluation of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Significance of Competitive Endogenous RNA Networks in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We present a PDX Authentication System (PAS), by combining a commercially available OpenArray assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with in-house R studio programs, to validate PDXs established in individual mice from acute lymphoblastic leukemia biopsies. The PAS is sufficiently robust to identify contamination at levels as low as 3%, similar to the gold standard of short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. We have surveyed a panel of PDXs established from 73 individual leukemia patients, and found that the PAS provided sufficient discriminatory power to identify each xenograft. The identified SNP-discrepant PDXs demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles, indicating a risk of contamination for PDXs at high passage number. The PAS also allows for the authentication of tumor cells with complex karyotypes from solid tumors including prostate cancer and Ewing's sarcoma.

The aim of the study is to determine the diagnostic performance of mpMRI in characterizing viable recurrent tumor and lymph node metastasis following radiation therapy (RT) failure.  Methods and materials:   Between January 2007 and July 2014, 19 patients with biopsy-proven recurrent PCa after primary RT underwent 3T mpMRI and subsequent salvage prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. mpMRI images were independently reviewed by 2 genitourinary MRI radiologists (R1 and R2), blinded to the pathology results, to evaluate extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic curves, and interobserver agreement (R1 and R2) were evaluated for each outcome on a per-patient basis. Final pathologic results were used as a gold standard for comparison in all patients. A multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the index lesion's apparent diffusion coefficient value and its enhancement characteristics with the Gleason score.  Results:   EPE was found in 14 (73.7%) patients, SVI in 13 (68.4%), and PLNM in 5 (26.3%). mpMRI sensitivity for PLNM was 60.0% (R1 and R2) with specificity of 85.7% (R1) and 92.8% (R2). With regards to SVI, the sensitivity was 61.5% (R1) and 76.9% (R2), with a specificity of 66.6% (R1 and R2). Sensitivity for EPE was 50.0% (R1) and 71.43% (R2), with a specificity of 80.0% (R1) and 100.00% (R2). No significant associations were found at multivariate analysis. The evaluation of PLNM, SVI, and PCa recurrence within the prostate demonstrated moderate interobserver agreement (κ, 0.51-0.57).

We recently identified a Myc target and chromatin reader protein, ING4, as a necessary component of human prostate luminal epithelial cell differentiation, which is often lost in primary prostate tumors. Furthermore, loss of ING4 in the context of oncogenic mutations is required for prostate tumorigenesis. Identifying the gene targets of ING4 can provide insight into how its loss disrupts differentiation and leads to prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a combination of RNA-Seq, a best candidate approach, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we identified Miz1 as a new ING4 target. ING4 or Miz1 overexpression, shRNA knock-down, and a Myc-binding mutant were used in a human in vitro differentiation assay to assess the role of Miz1 in luminal cell differentiation.  Results:   ING4 directly binds the Miz1 promoter and is required to induce Miz1 mRNA and protein expression during luminal cell differentiation. Miz1 mRNA was not induced in shING4 expressing cells or tumorigenic cells in which ING4 is not expressed. Miz1 dependency on ING4 was unique to differentiating luminal cells; Miz1 mRNA expression was not induced in basal cells. Although Miz1 is a direct target of ING4, and its overexpression can drive luminal cell differentiation, Miz1 was not required for differentiation.  Conclusions:   Miz1 is a newly identified ING4-induced target gene which can drive prostate luminal epithelial cell differentiation although it is not absolutely required.

Materials and methods:   Prostates were obtained from: normal prostates from 20 men, diagnosis of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) from 35 men and prostate cancer from 86 men. We studied the behavior of cytokines that have been implicated in inflammatory processes: TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-1, EGF and TGF-B. Expression of these cytokines and its receptors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Spearman's test, Kaplan-Meier curves, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed.  Results:   Spearman's analysis showed that there was at least one correlation between TGFB-B, IL-6, gp-130, IL-1B, IL-1R, IL-1RII and clinic pathological feature (preoperative serum PSA, clinical t stage, pathological t stage, positive surgical margins, biochemical progression, survival). Immunostaining score was correlated with some of the clinicopathological feature. In Cox multivariate analysis between the prognostic variables (pathological T stage, Gleason score and lymph node) and immunohistochemical parameters (TGF-B, IL-1a, intensity TGFBRI and intensity TGFBRII) only the expression of IL-1a was retained as independent predictors of biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest a role for prostatic expression of TGF-B, IL-1a, TGFBRI and TGFBRII as prognostic markers for prostate cancer.

This study estimates RRs for lethal prostate cancer based on comprehensive family history data, with the goal of improving identification of those men at highest risk of dying from prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used a population-based genealogical resource linked to a statewide electronic SEER cancer registry and death certificates to estimate relative risks (RR) for death from prostate cancer based upon family history. Over 600,000 male probands were analyzed, representing a variety of family history constellations of lethal prostate cancer. RR estimates were based on the ratio of the observed to the expected number of lethal prostate cancer cases using internal rates.  Results:   RRs for lethal prostate cancer based on the number of affected first-degree relatives (FDR) ranged from 2.49 (95% CI: 2.27, 2.73) for exactly 1 FDR to 5.30 (2.13, 10.93) for ≥3 affected FDRs. In an absence of affected FDRs, increased risk was also significant for increasing numbers of affected second-degree or third degree relatives. Equivalent risks were observed for similar maternal and paternal family history.  Conclusions:   This study provides population-based estimates of lethal prostate cancer risk based on lethal prostate cancer family history.

Frequently, abiraterone and enzalutamide are used prior to chemotherapy in mCRPC, given the more favorable safety profiles. However, there is no published data on clinical outcomes regarding best sequencing of these two agents.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide and abiraterone at Johns Hopkins was conducted. Patients were treated with sequential enzalutamide and abiraterone, in either order. The combined progression-free survival (PFS: PFS1 + PFS2) of abiraterone-to-enzalutamide was compared to the reverse sequence, where PFS1 and PFS2 represented clinical/radiographic progression-free survival on the first and second agents, respectively. Overall survival (OS) from the start of the first therapy to death and PSA response rates (defined as ≥50% PSA declines at any time) were also compared between groups. Outcomes were adjusted using propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox analyses.  Results:   Eighty-one patients who satisfied our entry criteria were identified: 65 in the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide group and 16 in the enzalutamide-to-abiraterone group. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. Multivariable analysis suggested a difference between groups favoring the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide sequence with respect to combined PFS (HR 0.37, 95%CI 0.22-0.64, P < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in OS between the groups after multivariable adjustment (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.29-1.11, P = 0.098), although OS was numerically superior in the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide group.  Conclusions:   We observed differences suggesting improved outcomes favoring the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide sequence in men with mCRPC, with statistical confirmation in terms of PFS but not OS. Prospective studies are required to verify these hypothesis-generating findings. Further evaluation of biomarkers to inform optimal treatment sequencing in men with mCRPC is urgently needed.

Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in cancer progression and is regulated by a complex mechanism that includes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. However, there is little information regarding relationship between lymphangiogenesis and androgen deprivation. The aim of this study was to clarify changes in lymphangiogenesis and VEGF expression induced by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro.  Methods:   Patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy were enrolled in the study (NHT, n = 60 and non-NHT, n = 64). Lymph vessels were identified by D2-40 immunoreactivity and lymph vessel density and lymph vessel area (LVD and LVA, respectively) were measured from micrographs. The expression of VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of LVD and LVA for biochemical recurrence was also investigated.  Results:   Mean LVD ± SD was higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (11.3 ± 3.0 vs. 7.1 ± 3.4 per high power field; P < 0.001). LVA was larger in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (512.8 ± 174.9 vs. 202.7 ± 72.8 µm2 ; P < 0.001). VEGF-A expression was lower whereas VEGF-C and -D levels were higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group. VEGF-B expression in specimens with NHT was lower than that in biopsy specimens at diagnosis. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies used androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line. LVA was found to be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in patients who received NHT.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that NHT stimulates lymphangiogenesis via upregulation of VEGF-C and -D, which may increase LVA and affect the outcome of prostate cancer patients. This findings were supported by in vitro data of prostate cancer cell. Prostate 77:255-262, 2017. © 2016 The Authors.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of men between 40 and 80 years of age who underwent PSA screening for prostate cancer from 2008 to 2013 in a population-based cohort of privately insured patients. Unadjusted and adjusted rates were calculated using member-years and reported per 1000 member-years.  Results:   Rates of PSA screening remained stable from 190.4 per 1000 member-years in 2008 to 196.4 in 2013 (P = .66). From 2008 to 2013, PSA screening did not change for patients aged 50-59 (236.5 to 241.1 per 1000 member-years; P = .78), 60-64 (284.1 to 288.3 per 1000 member-years; P = .77), 65-69 (250.6 to 248.0 per 1000 member-years; P = .56), and 70-74 (266.4 to 280.3 per 1000 member-years; P = .17). However, patients ≥75 years had marked decrease in the rate of PSA screening from 201.5 to 124.1 per 1000 member-years (P = .04). Across different racial groups, PSA screening rates remain unchanged over time irrespective of age.  Conclusion:   Among this population-based cohort of privately insured men, we found little effect on PSA screening from changes to the US Preventive Services Task Force clinical practice guidelines. However, the rates of PSA screening were much lower among older men (>75 years).

Methods:   Within a multi-institutional cohort, 262 patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for hPCa were identified. CF was defined as local recurrence or distant metastases. A time dependent ROC curve was used to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) using TV as single marker to predict clinical failure at 10 years. We searched for the TV cut off value with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity predicting CF. Three multivariable Cox regression analyses (MVA) tested the predictors of CF after RP. Predictors of the model 1 were pre-operative PSA, pathologic stage (PT), pathologic Gleason sum (GS), surgical margin status, and lymph node invasion. Predictors of the models 2 and 3 were the same of model 1 plus TV as a continuous or dichotomous variable using the defined cutoff, respectively. Validation (leave-one-out-cross-validation-LOOCV) of each model was performed.  Results:   Overall, 46 (17.6%) patients experienced CF. The TV value was 6.29 ml. In MVA of models 2 and 3, PT and GS remained independent predictors of CF. Moreover, in model 2 TV (HR:1.07,) and in model 3 TV >6.29 ml (HR:2.99,) were independently associated with CF. In LOOCV, the C-index of models 1-3 were 65.53%, 71.75%, and 70.26%, respectively.  Conclusions:   TV is an independent predictor of CF in hPCa patients.

These complications are increasing alarmingly.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study of 17 183 transrectal prostate biopsies performed at the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district in southern Finland during 2005-2013. Biopsies were linked to a database of positive blood cultures, yielding 111 bacteremic cases, and yearly bacteremia rates were determined. By multiple regression analysis, demographic risk factors of the whole biopsy cohort for developing bacteremia or fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant bacteremia were studied. Clinical risk factors for bacteremia caused by an FQ-resistant organism and for serious bacteremic outcomes were studied by univariate and multivariate analyzes.  Results:   The average bacteremia rate was 0.7% (111 of 17 183 biopsies) and an increase was observed from 0.5% in 2005 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-0.9) to 1.2% in 2012 (95% CI 0.8-1.8); 53.2% were caused by an FQ-resistant organism. In univariate regression analysis, previous biopsy sessions and increasing calendar year of biopsy associated with the risk of developing bacteremia (odds ratio (OR) 1.232, 95% CI: 1.020-1.488, P=0.030 and OR 1.164, 95% CI: 1.079-1.255, P<0.001, respectively), but only increasing calendar year of biopsy remained statistically significant (OR 1.155, 95% CI: 1.070-1.247, P<0.001) in multivariate analysis. Foreign travel within 3 months was associated with FQ resistance in multivariate analysis (OR 7.158, 95% CI: 1.042 to infinite, P=0.045). The study failed to show any significant clinical risk factors for serious bacteremic outcomes (requiring intensive care, developing deep infection foci or death).  Conclusions:   The postbiopsy bacteremia rate doubled during the study period and half of the cases were caused by FQ-resistant organisms. Recent foreign travel increased the risk for FQ resistance.

A pamphlet and video outlining the proper preparation for prostate IMRT was created to decrease additional scans and the associated costs, while increasing patient satisfaction. A controlled, randomized experimental group study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the multimedia tools (the video and the pamphlet), as compared to the pamphlet only, in preparing patients for their planning CT appointment. We found no statistical difference between the multimedia group and the pamphlet group in patients' preparedness for their appointments and the rescanning rate. However, patients in the multimedia group indicated that they felt more prepared about their treatment after watching the video and stated that they would recommend the video to other patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, patients who had to wait longer for their planning CT appointment felt less prepared by the materials than those with a shorter wait time. We recommend reducing wait times between appointments as much as possible to increase patients' preparedness for the planning CT.

We found that PECs stimulated with Tv increased the production of IL-6, as well as the expression of TLR2, TLR4, MAPKs (p38, JNK, ERK), NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3, and levels of ROS. Inhibition of TLR2 or TLR4 reduced IL-6 production as well as expression of these other factors, and agents inhibiting ROS, MAPKs, NF-κB and JAK reduced IL-6 production. However, when PECs were stimulated with Tv, transcripts of mesenchymal cell markers increased, and epithelial cell markers decreased. In addition, the induction of EMT was suppressed by inhibitors of JAK or NF-κB. These findings are the first evidence that Tv infection of prostate epithelial cells may induce EMT.""","""['I H Han', 'J H Kim', 'S S Kim', 'M H Ahn', 'J S Ryu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Parasite Immunol""","""['Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Inflammatory mediators of prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis promote proliferative and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells.', 'Inflammatory Responses in a Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Line (BPH-1) Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Proliferation of prostate epithelia induced by IL-6 from stroma reacted with Trichomonas\xa0vaginalis.', 'Trichomonas vaginalis: Pathogenesis, Symbiont Interactions, and Host Cell Immune Responses.', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Infinity war: Trichomonas vaginalis and interactions with host immune response.', 'Trichomonas tenax induces barrier defects and modulates the inflammatory cytotoxicity of gingival and pulmonary epithelial cells.', 'The correlation between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and reproductive system cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between trichomoniasis and prostate and bladder diseases: a population-based case-control study.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated toxicity, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression data from 47 CRPC patients treated with fourth- or fifth-line Enz.  Results:   All patients were treated with docetaxel and abiraterone acetate and 42 patients (89%) with cabazitaxel. The median age of the patients was 69 years (IQR, 63-73.5), 79% had bone metastases, 55% had lymph node metastases, and 17% had visceral metastases. The median duration of Enz treatment was 12.0 weeks (IQR, 8.3-20.4), and 11 patients (23%) responded to Enz (maximum PSA decline ≥50%). In general, Enz was well tolerated, with the most frequently reported adverse events being fatigue and nausea. The median OS was 40.1 weeks (95% CI, 25.4-61.4), the median PFS was 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.9-14.0) and the median time to PSA progression was 15.7 weeks (95% CI, 14.0-28.7).

Reports in the literature on rectourethral fistula repair technique and outcomes are limited to single institution series. We examined the variations in technique and outcomes of rectourethral fistula repair in a multi-institutional setting.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively identified patients who underwent rectourethral fistula repair after prostate cancer treatment at 1 of 4 large volume reconstructive urology centers, including University of California-San Francisco, University College London Hospitals, Lahey Clinic and Devine-Jordan Center for Reconstructive Surgery, in a 15-year period. We examined the types of prostate cancer treatment, technical aspects of rectourethral fistula repair and outcomes.  Results:   After prostate cancer treatment 201 patients underwent rectourethral fistula repair. The fistula developed in 97 men (48.2%) after radical prostatectomy alone and in 104 (51.8%) who received a form of energy ablation. In the ablation group 84% of patients underwent bowel diversion before rectourethral fistula repair compared to 65% in the prostatectomy group. An interposition flap or graft was placed in 91% and 92% of the 2 groups, respectively. Concomitant bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture developed in 26% of patients in the ablation group and in 14% in the prostatectomy group. Postoperatively the rates of urinary incontinence and complications were higher in the energy ablation group at 35% and 25% vs 16% and 11%, respectively. The ultimate success rate of fistula repair in the energy ablation and radical prostatectomy groups was 87% and 99% with 92% overall success.  Conclusions:   Rectourethral fistulas due to prostate cancer therapy can be reconstructed successfully in a high percent of patients. This avoids permanent urinary diversion in these complex cases.""","""['Catherine R Harris', 'Jack W McAninch', 'Anthony R Mundy', 'Leonard N Zinman', 'Gerald H Jordan', 'Daniela Andrich', 'Alex J Vanni', 'Ramón Virasoro', 'Benjamin N Breyer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Transperineal management for postoperative and radiation rectourethral fistulas.', 'Gracilis Muscle Interposition for Rectourethral Fistula After Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: A Prospective Evaluation and Long-term Follow-up.', 'Transsphincteric repair of rectourethral fistulas: 15 years of experience with the York Mason approach.', 'Recto-urethral fistula secondary to prostate cancer.', 'Complications after radical prostatectomy: anastomotic stricture and rectourethral fistula.', 'Outcomes of gracilis muscle interposition for rectourethral fistulas caused by treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic Radiation Disease.', 'Gracilis muscle flap combined with a laparoscopic transabdominal approach is effective in the treatment of post-prostatectomy rectourethral fistula: A case report.', 'A Curious Case of Rectal Ejaculation.', 'Management of Medium and Long Term Complications Following Prostate Cancer Treatment Resulting in Urinary Diversion - A Narrative Review.']"""

Over the years, various techniques have been introduced to prevent lymphocele, but no final conclusion can be drawn regarding the superiority of one technique over another. In this prospective study, 220 patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between 2012 and 2015 were randomized to receive titanium clips (group A, n=110) or bipolar coagulation (group B, n=110) to seal lymphatic vessels at the level of the femoral canal during extended PLND (ePLND). Ultrasound examination was used to detect lymphoceles at 10 and 90 d after surgery. Lymphocele was defined as any clearly definable fluid collection and was considered clinically significant when requiring treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between groups A and B regarding overall lymphocele incidence (47% vs 48%; difference -0.91%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 0.7; p=0.9) and the rate of clinically significant lymphocele [5% vs 4%; difference 0.75%, 95% CI, 0.1-3.2; p=0.7]. The two groups were comparable regarding mean (±SD) lymphocele volume (30±32 vs 35±39ml; p=0.6), lymphocele location (unilateral, 37% vs 35%, p=0.7; bilateral, 13% vs 14%, p=0.9), and time to lymphocele diagnosis (95% vs 98% on postoperative day 10; p=0.5). In conclusion, this trial failed to identify a difference in lymphocele occurrence between clipping and coagulation of the lymphatic vessels at the level of the femoral canal during robot-assisted ePLND for prostate cancer.

Limited evidence suggests laser ablation/vaporization is inferior to enucleation with respect to reoperation rates. Our objective was to determine if properly performed laser ablation results in outcomes similar to enucleation.  Materials and methods:   A total of 198 patients with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and/or acute urinary retention had holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) or HoLAP between 2008 and 2014. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer, prior pelvic radiation, or bladder cancer involving the bladder neck or prostatic urethra were excluded. All procedures involved residents and were supervised by one experienced surgeon. The decision to perform HoLAP versus HoLEP was made intraoperatively. Demographics, pre, peri and postoperative data were collected.  Results:   A total of 169 men were analyzed: 54 had HoLAP and 115 had HoLEP. Mean follow up was 27.16 months for HoLAP, and 38.18 months for HoLEP. As expected, the HoLEP group had larger prostates, longer mean operative times, and greater reduction in total PSA. There was no difference in the net change of flow rate between groups.  Conclusion:   Both HoLEP and HoLAP are appropriate surgical interventions for the management of BPH, when properly performed.

Results:   Although EPS volume, total recovered RNA, and RNA expression biomarkers (TMPRSS2: ERG, PCA3, PSA) have been successful in both biopsy outcome prediction, and in the prediction of upstaging in active surveillance eligible patients, they were unable to predict upgrading in patients eligible for active surveillance under National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

The therapeutic efficacy of epigenetic inhibitors was determined in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and LNCaP) using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Cells were also treated with carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-convulsant with histone deacetylase inhibitor-like properties. 5-Aza, TSA or CBZ alone did not decrease MTT staining in PC-3 or LNCaP cells after 48 h. In contrast, docetaxel, a frontline chemotherapeutic induced concentration-dependent decreases in MTT staining. Pretreatment with 5-Aza or TSA increased docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells, but not PC-3 cells. TSA pretreatment also increased cisplatin-induced toxicity in LNCaP cells. Carfilzomib (CFZ), a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma had minimal effect on LNCaP cell viability, but reduced MTT staining 50% in PC-3 cells compared to control, and pretreatment with 5-Aza further enhanced toxicity. Treatment of normal rat kidney (NRK) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with the same concentrations of epigenetic inhibitors used in prostate cancer cells significantly decreased MTT staining in all cell lines after 48 h. Interestingly, we found that the toxicity of epigenetic inhibitors to kidney cells was dependent on both the compound and the stage of cell growth. The effect of 5-Aza and TSA on DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity, respectively, was confirmed by assessing the methylation and acetylation of the CDK inhibitor p21. Collectively, these data show that combinatorial treatment with epigenetic inhibitors alters the efficacy of chemotherapeutics in cancer cells in a compound- and cell-specific manner; however, this treatment also has the potential to induce nephrotoxic cell injury.""","""['N E Scholpa', 'R T Kolli', 'M Moore', 'R D Arnold', 'T C Glenn', 'B S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Bromate-induced Changes in p21 DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation in Renal Cells.', 'Incubation with somatostatin, 5-aza decitabine and trichostatin up-regulates somatostatin receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.', ""Treatment of buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) donor cells with trichostatin A and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine alters their growth characteristics, gene expression and epigenetic status and improves the in vitro developmental competence, quality and epigenetic status of cloned embryos."", 'New clinical developments in histone deacetylase inhibitors for epigenetic therapy of cancer.', 'Epigenetic Targets and their Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy.', 'Epigenetic Mechanisms Involved in Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity: An Update.', 'Bromate-induced Changes in p21 DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation in Renal Cells.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between October 2010 and April 2014, a total of 137 patients underwent PPB and 4-month followup pelvic and chest x-ray imaging. All patients had exclusively SSs placed and an immediate postimplant fluoroscopic image of the seed cluster. Followup x-ray images were evaluated for the number, location, and displacement of seeds in comparison to Day 0 fluoroscopic images. Significant seed displacement was defined as seed displacement >1 cm from the seed cluster. Followup chest x-rays were evaluated for seed migration to the chest.  Results:   Seed migration to the chest occurred in 3 of the 137 patients (2%). Seed loss occurred in 38 of the 137 patients (28%), with median loss of one seed (range, 1-16), and total seeds loss of 104 of 10,088 (1.0%) implanted. Local seed displacement was seen in 12 of the 137 patients (8.8%), and total seeds displaced were 0.15% (15/10,088).  Conclusions:   SS placement in PPB is associated with low rates of substantial seed loss, local displacement, or migration to the chest. Comparing immediate postimplant fluoroscopic images to followup plain x-ray images is a straightforward method to supplement quality assurance in PPB and was found to be useful in identifying cases where seed loss was potentially of clinical significance.""","""['B J Birckhead', 'C C Fossum', 'C L Deufel', 'K M Furutani', 'K W Merrell', 'B A Schueler', 'L A Mynderse', 'R Choo', 'B J Davis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Reducing seed migration to near zero with stranded-seed implants: Comparison of seed migration rates to the chest in 1000 permanent prostate brachytherapy patients undergoing implants with loose or stranded seeds.', 'Sequential comparison of seed loss and prostate dosimetry of stranded seeds with loose seeds in 125I permanent implant for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Seed fixity in the prostate/periprostatic region following brachytherapy.', 'Incidence of seed migration to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds.', 'A review on permanent implants for prostate brachytherapy with comparison between stranded and loose seeds.', 'Dosimetric outcomes of preoperative treatment planning with intraoperative optimization using stranded seeds in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Self-Expanding Anchors for Stabilizing Percutaneously Implanted Microdevices in Biological Tissues.', 'Low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Men who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and underwent prostatectomy between 2004 and 2012 were abstracted from the National Cancer Data Base. Only those with pT3-4Nx-0M0 or pT2cNx-0M0 with positive margins were included. We identified patients receiving RT to the pelvis to a dose between 5940 and 7560 cGy. Delivery of hormone therapy was also identified. Descriptive statistics were used to determine adjuvant RT use as well as patterns of care regarding RT dose and hormone use; data were compared by Pearson's chi-square test.  Results:   A total of 133,874 men were included in this study, of whom 12,073 (9.0%) received adjuvant RT. Of those receiving adjuvant RT, 4011 (33.2%) also received hormone therapy. There was a trend toward more frequent use of higher RT doses over time. RT doses of ≥ 7000 cGy were provided 21.4% of the time in 2004-2006 and increased over time to 38.9% by 2010-2012 (P < .001). There was also a rapid increase in the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy from 20.7% of patients in 2004 to 69.2% in 2012.  Conclusion:   Most men (91.0%) with pT3/T4 or pT2 disease with positive margins do not receive adjuvant RT.

In the current studies, we have explored the possibility that cytokines may be one of the common regulatory molecules for elevated Tn levels in both cancer and inflammation. We showed that the Tn level is elevated by the conditioned media of HrasG12V-transformed-BEAS-2B cells. Similarly, the conditioned media obtained from LPS-stimulated monocytes also elevated Tn levels in primary human gingival fibroblasts, suggesting the involvement of cytokines and/or other soluble factors. Indeed, purified inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 up-regulated Tn levels in gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, TNF-α was shown to down-regulate the COSMC gene as evidenced by reduced levels of the COSMC mRNA and protein, as well as hypermethylation of the CpG islands of the COSMC gene promoter.

Growing evidences support the idea that deregulated cellular metabolism is linked to such resistance. Indeed, both components of the glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways are involved in altered metabolism linked to chemoresistance of several cancers. Here we investigated the drug-induced metabolic adaptations able to confer advantages to docetaxel resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We found that docetaxel-resistant PC3 cells (PC3-DR) acquire a pro-invasive behavior undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and a decrease of both intracellular ROS and cell growth. Metabolic analyses revealed that PC3-DR cells have a more efficient respiratory phenotype than sensitive cells, involving utilization of glucose, glutamine and lactate by the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Consequently, targeting mitochondrial complex I by metformin administration, impairs proliferation and invasiveness of PC3-DR cells without effects on parental cells. Furthermore, stromal fibroblasts, which cause a ""reverse Warburg"" phenotype in PCa cells, reduce docetaxel toxicity in both sensitive and resistant PCa cells. However, re-expression of miR-205, a microRNA strongly down-regulated in EMT and associated to docetaxel resistance, is able to shift OXPHOS to a Warburg metabolism, thereby resulting in an elevated docetaxel toxicity in PCa cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that resistance to docetaxel induces a shift from Warburg to OXPHOS, mandatory for conferring a survival advantage to resistant cells, suggesting that impairing such metabolic reprogramming could be a successful therapeutic approach.""","""['Luigi Ippolito', 'Alberto Marini', 'Lorenzo Cavallini', 'Andrea Morandi', 'Laura Pietrovito', 'Gianfranco Pintus', 'Elisa Giannoni', 'Thomas Schrader', 'Martin Puhr', 'Paola Chiarugi', 'Maria Letizia Taddei']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['INPP4B reverses docetaxel resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'miR-27b and miR-34a enhance docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB1.', 'The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition drivers ZEB1 and ZEB2 in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Warburg effect in tumor progression: mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as an anti-metastasis mechanism.', 'Hypoxia Dictates Metabolic Rewiring of Tumors: Implications for Chemoresistance.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Mitochondrial structure and function adaptation in residual triple negative breast cancer cells surviving chemotherapy treatment.', 'Prognostic significance of CKAP2L expression in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Understanding the Contribution of Lactate Metabolism in Cancer Progress: A Perspective from Isomers.', 'Drug resistance mechanisms create targetable proteostatic vulnerabilities in Her2+ breast cancers.']"""

Primary stromal cultures derived from human bone marrow, normal prostate, or prostate cancer tissue are highly enriched in MSCs and stromal progenitors. Using conditioned media from these primary cultures, a robust pro-angiogenic response was observed in a physiologically-relevant three-dimensional fibrin matrix assay. To evaluate the utility of this assay, the allosteric HDAC4 inhibitor tasquinimod and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab were used as model compounds with distinct mechanisms of action.

Previously, we demonstrated that activation of NF-κB signaling increases ARVs expression in prostate cancer (PC) cells, thereby promoting progression to CRPC. However, it is unclear how NF-κB signaling is activated in CRPC. In this study, we report that long-term treatment with anti-androgens increases a neuroendocrine (NE) hormone - gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRP-R) expression in PC cells. In addition, activation of GRP/GRP-R signaling increases ARVs expression through activating NF-κB signaling. This results in an androgen-dependent tumor progressing to a castrate resistant tumor. The knock-down of AR-V7 restores sensitivity to antiandrogens of PC cells over-expressing the GRP/GRP-R signaling pathway. These findings strongly indicate that the axis of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) induces GRP/GRP-R activity, activation NF-κB and increased levels of AR-V7 expression resulting in progression to CRPC.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) is the most important member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. MMP2 digests the basement membrane and causes changes in the extracellular matrix which in turn facilitate cancer invasion. It, therefore, has a major role in tumor angiogenesis. Previous studies have identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism C/T at position -1306 of MMP2 gene promoter which is a key regulatory factor in cancer progression.  Aim:   The present study aimed to determine the association between MMP2 polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer in Iranian men.  Methods:   This case-control study was performed on 50 paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissue samples and 54 blood samples from healthy men. Genotyping of the samples was performed using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM). Finally, 20 % of the genotypes were confirmed by sequencing.  Results:   No significant associations were found between CT and TT genotypes and the risk of prostate cancer. However, there were no significant relationships between the genotypes and the studied factors, e.g., age, pathological stage, and Gleason Score.

OL inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast, thyroid, prostate, and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Much less is known about the effects of OL on animal models of carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the ability of OL to prevent the azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer upset and DNA damage in mice. Animals, fed with a basal diet either enriched or not with OL (125 mg/kg), were injected with AOM (10 mg/kg, once a week for 6 weeks) and sacrificed after either 7 weeks for histological analysis of colon crypt dysplasia and evaluation of DNA damage in leukocytes or 17 weeks for counting the macroscopically observable colon tumors. An OL-enriched diet prevented the AOM-induced preneoplastic lesions in different colon segments, reducing the severity of crypt dysplasia and DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes. In addition, OL significantly reduced the AOM-induced tumor incidence from 57% to 14% (P < .05, chi-square test) in the medial colon segment. This study shows that OL is able to prevent CRC and DNA damage in mice treated with the carcinogen AOM. These results stimulate further human cancer prevention studies with OL-enriched food supplements that are actually available on the market.""","""['Maria Vittoria Sepporta', 'Raffaela Fuccelli', 'Patrizia Rosignoli', 'Giovanni Ricci', 'Maurizio Servili', 'Roberto Fabiani']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Med Food""","""['Inhibition of Formation of Azoxymethane-induced Colonic Aberrant Crypt Foci in Rats by Edible Green Algae Capsosiphon fulvescens and Brown Algae Hizikia fusiforme.', 'Sequential and morphological analyses of aberrant crypt foci formation in mice of differing susceptibility to azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis.', 'Effect of dietary apigenin on colonic ornithine decarboxylase activity, aberrant crypt foci formation, and tumorigenesis in different experimental models.', 'Dietary iron promotes azoxymethane-induced colon tumors in mice.', 'Dietary folate protects against azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci development and oxidative stress in rat colon.', 'Deficiency in mammalian STN1 promotes colon cancer development via inhibiting DNA repair.', 'Phenolic Phytochemicals for Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer: A Critical Evaluation of In Vivo Studies.', 'Oxidative Stress and Inflammation as Targets for Novel Preventive and Therapeutic Approaches in Non-Communicable Diseases II.', 'Olea europea L.

In this study, we have evaluated the efficacy of TAS-115 in preventing prostate cancer metastasis to the bone and bone destruction using the PC3 cell line. When PC3 cells were injected into proximal tibiae in nude mouse, severe trabecular and cortical bone destruction and subsequent tumor growths were detected. Oral administration of TAS-115 almost completely inhibited both PC3-induced bone loss and PC3 cell proliferation by suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption. In an ex vivo bone organ culture, PC3 cells induced osteoclastic bone resorption when co-cultured with calvarial bone, but TAS-115 effectively suppressed the PC3-induced bone destruction. We found that macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation and subsequent receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclast formation were largely suppressed by adding TAS-115. The phosphorylation of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor FMS and osteoclast related kinases such as ERK and Akt were also suppressed by the presence of TAS-115. Gene expression profiling showed that FMS expression was only seen in macrophage and in the osteoclast cell lineage.

The development of antibody-based radiotracers requires extensive characterization of their in vitro and in vivo properties, including their ability to target tumors in an antigen-selective manner. In this study, we investigated the use of Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) as compared with PET as a modality for evaluating the in vivo behavior of antibody-based radiotracers.  Methods:   The anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) huJ591 antibody (IgG; 150 kDa) and its minibody (Mb; 80 kDa) format were functionalized with the chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1-glutaric acid-4,7-diacetic acid (NODAGA) and radiolabeled with the positron-emitting radionuclide 64Cu (half-life, 12.7 h). Immunoreactive preparations of the radiolabeled antibodies were injected into NCr nu/nu mice harboring PSMA-positive CWR22Rv1 and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumor xenografts. Tumor targeting was evaluated by both PET and CLI.  Results: 64Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-IgG and 64Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-Mb retained the ability to bind cell surface PSMA, and both radiotracers exhibited selective uptake into PSMA-positive tumors. Under the experimental conditions used, PSMA-selective uptake of 64Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-IgG and 64Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-Mb was observed by CLI as early as 3 h after injection, with tumor-to-background ratios peaking at 24 (IgG) and 16 (Mb) h after injection. Targeting data generated by CLI correlated with that generated by PET and necropsy.  Conclusion:   CLI provided a rapid and simple assessment of the targeting specificity and pharmacokinetics of the antibody-based PET radiotracers that correlated well with the behavior observed by standard PET imaging. Moreover, CLI provided clear discrimination between uptake kinetics of an intact IgG and its small-molecular-weight derivative Mb. These data support the use of CLI for the evaluation of radiotracer performance.""","""[""Jimson W D'Souza"", 'Harvey Hensley', 'Mohan Doss', 'Charles Beigarten', 'Michael Torgov', 'Tove Olafsen', 'Jian Q Yu', 'Matthew K Robinson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Comparative immuno-Cerenkov luminescence and -PET imaging enables detection of PSMA+ tumors in mice using 64Cu-radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies.', 'Noninvasive Imaging of PSMA in prostate tumors with (89)Zr-Labeled huJ591 engineered antibody fragments: the faster alternatives.', 'Cerenkov luminescence imaging of medical isotopes.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'PET imaging of colorectal and breast cancer by targeting EphB4 receptor with 64Cu-labeled hAb47 and hAb131 antibodies.', 'A review of recent and emerging approaches for the clinical application of Cerenkov luminescence imaging.', 'Synthesis and In Vivo Evaluation of a Site-specifically Labeled Radioimmunoconjugate for Dual-Modal (PET/NIRF) Imaging of MT1-MMP in Sarcomas.', 'Detection of Shortwave-Infrared Cerenkov Luminescence from Medical Isotopes.', 'In situ lymphoma imaging in a spontaneous mouse model using the Cerenkov Luminescence of F-18 and Ga-67 isotopes.', 'Site-specific antibody fragment conjugates for targeted imaging.']"""

Patients and methods:   This is a retrospective analysis of 294 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer treated with RS-RALP in a high-volume centre from November 2012 to February 2015. Patients were divided into three groups based on their transrectal ultrasonography estimated PV as follows: group 1, <40 mL (231 patients); group 2, 40-60 mL (47); group 3, >60 mL (16). Perioperative, oncological, and continence outcomes were compared between the three groups.  Results:   The median [interquartile range (IQR)] PV for each group was; 26.1 (22-31) mL, 45.9 (41-50) mL, and 70 (68-85) mL.

DEPTH is a machine learning algorithm for feature ranking of ultra-high dimensional datasets, built from well-established statistical tools such as bootstrapping, penalized regression, and decision trees. Unlike marginal regression, which considers each SNP individually, the key idea behind DEPTH is to rank groups of SNPs in terms of their joint strength of association with the outcome. Our aim was to compare the performance of DEPTH with that of standard logistic regression analysis.  Methods:   We selected 1,854 prostate cancer cases and 1,894 controls from the UK for whom 541,129 SNPs were measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanHap550 array. Confirmation was sought using 4,152 cases and 2,874 controls, ascertained from the UK and Australia, for whom 211,155 SNPs were measured using the iCOGS Illumina Infinium array.  Results:   From the DEPTH analysis, we identified 14 regions associated with prostate cancer risk that had been reported previously, five of which would not have been identified by conventional logistic regression. We also identified 112 novel putative susceptibility regions.  Conclusions:   DEPTH can reveal new risk-associated regions that would not have been identified using a conventional logistic regression analysis of individual SNPs.  Impact:   This study demonstrates that the DEPTH algorithm could identify additional genetic susceptibility regions that merit further investigation.

SLC44A4 is a member of a family of putative choline transporters that we show to be markedly upregulated in a variety of epithelial tumors, most notably prostate and pancreatic cancer. SLC44A4 is normally expressed on the apical surface of secretory epithelial cells, but in cancer we show expression is not restricted to the luminal surface in advanced and undifferentiated tumors. ASG-5ME consists of a human IgG2 anti-SLC44A4 antibody conjugated through a cleavable linker to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethylauristatin E. It has potent antitumor activity in both cell line - and patient-derived xenograft models of pancreatic and prostate cancers. Combination studies with ASG-5ME and nab-paclitaxel demonstrated combination effect in both pancreatic and prostate tumor models.

A subset of patients on active surveillance will later reclassify with disease progression, prompting definitive treatment. To minimize the risk of under treating such patients on active surveillance minimally invasive tests are urgently needed incorporating biomarkers to identify patients who will reclassify.  Materials and methods:   We assessed post-digital rectal examination urine samples of patients on active surveillance for select DNA methylation biomarkers that were previously investigated in radical prostatectomy specimens and shown to correlate with an increasing risk of prostate cancer. Post-digital rectal examination urine samples were prospectively collected from 153 men on active surveillance who were diagnosed with Gleason score 6 disease. Urinary sediment DNA was analyzed for 8 DNA methylation biomarkers by multiplex MethyLight assay. Correlative analyses were performed on gene methylation and clinicopathological variables to test the ability to predict patient risk reclassification.  Results:   Using backward logistic regression a 4-gene methylation classifier panel (APC, CRIP3, GSTP1 and HOXD8) was identified. The classifier panel was able to predict patient reclassification (OR 2.559, 95% CI 1.257-5.212). We observed this panel to be an independent and superior predictor compared to current clinical predictors such as prostate specific antigen at diagnosis or the percent of tumor positive cores in the initial biopsy.  Conclusion:   We report that a urine based classifier panel of 4 methylation biomarkers predicts disease progression in patients on active surveillance. Once validated in independent active surveillance cohorts, these promising biomarkers may help establish a less invasive method to monitor patients on active surveillance programs.""","""['Fang Zhao', 'Ekaterina Olkhov-Mitsel', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Jenna Sykes', 'Darko Zdravic', 'Vasundara Venkateswaran', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Urinary DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Noninvasive Prediction of Aggressive Disease in Patients with Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance: F.

We constructed conjugates of thiosalicylamides and the AR-binding small molecule tolfenamic acid, which binds the BF-3 site of AR, proximal to the coactivator ""FXXLF"" binding surface. The thiosalicylamide-tolfenamic acid conjugate, YZ03, but not the separate thiosalicylamide plus tolfenamic acid, significantly enhanced acetylation of endogenous AR in CWR22Rv1 cells. Further analysis confirms that Lys720, a residue critical to FXXLF coactivator peptide binding, is a site of acyl-YZ03 acetylation. Under acyl-transfer conditions, YZ03 significantly enhances the ability of BF-3 site binding ligands to inhibit AR-coactivator peptide association.

Reciprocal activation of these oncogenic pathways from negative cross talks contributes to low/limited success of pathway-selective inhibitors in curbing prostate cancer progression. We report that the antibiotic salinomycin, a cancer stem cell blocker, is a dual-acting AR and mTORC1 inhibitor, inhibiting PTEN-deficient castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer in culture and xenograft tumors. AR expression, its transcriptional activity, and androgen biosynthesis regulating enzymes CYP17A1, HSD3β1 were reduced by sub-micro molar salinomycin. Estrogen receptor-α expression was unchanged. Loss of phosphorylated AR at serine-81, which is an index for nuclear AR activity, preceded total AR reduction. Rapamycin enhanced the AR protein level without altering phosphoAR-Ser81 and CYP17A1. Inactivation of mTORC1, evident from reduced phosphorylation of mTOR and downstream effectors, as well as AMPK activation led to robust autophagy induction. Apoptosis increased modestly, albeit significantly, by sub-micro molar salinomycin. Enhanced stimulatory TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser-1387 by AMPK, and reduced inhibitory TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser-939/Thr-1462 catalyzed by AKT augmented TSC2/TSC1 activity, which led to mTORC1 inhibition. AMPK-mediated raptor phosphorylation further reduced mTOR's kinase function and mTORC1 activity.

Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine-threonine kinase that is often overexpressed across multiple tumor types, is one of the key regulators of CIN and is considered as a potential therapeutic target. However, targeting PLK1 has remained a challenge due to the off-target effects caused by the inhibition of other members of the polo-like family. Here we use synthetic dosage lethality (SDL), where the overexpression of PLK1 is lethal only when another, normally non-lethal, mutation or deletion is present. Rather than directly inhibiting PLK1, we found that inhibition of PP2A causes selective lethality to PLK1-overexpressing breast, pancreatic, ovarian, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer cells. As PP2A is widely regarded as a tumor suppressor, we resorted to gene expression datasets from cancer patients to functionally dissect its therapeutic relevance. We identified two major classes of PP2A subunits that negatively correlated with each other. Interestingly, most mitotic regulators, including PLK1, exhibited SDL interactions with only one class of PP2A subunits (PPP2R1A, PPP2R2D, PPP2R3B, PPP2R5B and PPP2R5D). Validation studies and other functional cell-based assays showed that inhibition of PPP2R5D affects both levels of phospho-Rb as well as sister chromatid cohesion in PLK1-overexpressing cells. Finally, analysis of clinical data revealed that patients with high expression of mitotic regulators and low expression of Class I subunits of PP2A improved survival.

Incidence and mortality trends for selected countries were analysed with data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) series and the WHO Mortality Database, respectively.  Results:   In 2012, almost 1.1 million new cancer cases were estimated annually, with important variations in rates across countries. The most common cancer types were breast, prostate, colorectum and lung cancer; stomach and cervical cancer ranked high in less developed countries. Increasing trends were observed in prostate, breast and colorectal cancer; lung cancer mortality trends diverged among males and females, while cervix cancer incidence and stomach cancer mortality uniformly decreased. A 66% increase in cancer cases in the region by 2030 is projected based on population aging and growth.

Many experimental techniques have been developed to measure the level of DNA methylation. Methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture followed by high-throughput sequencing (MBDCap-seq) is a widely used method for characterizing DNA methylation patterns in a genome-wide manner. However, current methods for processing MBDCap-seq datasets does not take into account of the region-specific genomic characteristics that might have an impact on the measurements of the amount of methylated DNA (signal) and background fluctuation (noise). Thus, specific software needs to be developed for MBDCap-seq experiments.  Results:   A new differential methylation quantification algorithm for MBDCap-seq, MBDDiff, was implemented. To evaluate the performance of the MBDDiff algorithm, a set of simulated signal based on negative binomial and Poisson distribution with parameters estimated from real MBDCap-seq datasets accompanied with different background noises were generated, and then performed against a set of commonly used algorithms for MBDCap-seq data analysis in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC), number of false discoveries and statistical power. In addition, we also demonstrated the effective of MBDDiff algorithm to a set of in-house prostate cancer samples, endometrial cancer samples published earlier, and a set of public-domain triple negative breast cancer samples to identify potential factors that contribute to cancer development and recurrence.  Conclusions:   In this paper we developed an algorithm, MBDDiff, designed specifically for datasets derived from MBDCap-seq. MBDDiff contains three modules: quality assessment of datasets and quantification of DNA methylation; determination of differential methylation of promoter regions; and visualization functionalities. Simulation results suggest that MBDDiff performs better compared to MEDIPS and DESeq in terms of AUC and the number of false discoveries at different levels of background noise. MBDDiff outperforms MEDIPS with increased backgrounds noise, but comparable performance when noise level is lower. By applying MBDDiff to several MBDCap-seq datasets, we were able to identify potential targets that contribute to the corresponding biological processes. Taken together, MBDDiff provides user an accurate differential methylation analysis for data generated by MBDCap-seq, especially under noisy conditions.""","""['Yuanhang Liu', 'Desiree Wilson', 'Robin J Leach', 'Yidong Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['BIMMER: a novel algorithm for detecting differential DNA methylation regions from MBDCap-seq data.', 'Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data by incorporating non-exonic mapped reads.', 'Comprehensive Whole DNA Methylome Analysis by Integrating MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq.', 'Detection of DNA methylation by MeDIP and MBDCap assays: an overview of techniques.', 'Methodological aspects of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis.', 'Differentially Methylated Super-Enhancers Regulate Target Gene Expression in Human Cancer.', 'A model of pulldown alignments from SssI-treated DNA improves DNA methylation prediction.']"""

In practice it is often impossible to observe the latent event precisely, making inference about this process difficult. To address this problem, we propose a joint model for the unobserved time to the latent and terminal events, with the two events linked by the baseline hazard. Covariates enter the model parametrically as linear combinations that multiply, respectively, the hazard for the latent event and the hazard for the terminal event conditional on the latent one. We derive the partial likelihood estimators for this problem assuming the latent event is observed, and propose a profile likelihood-based method for estimation when the latent event is unobserved. The baseline hazard in this case is estimated nonparametrically using the EM algorithm, which allows for closed-form Breslow-type estimators at each iteration, bringing improved computational efficiency and stability compared with maximizing the marginal likelihood directly.

Materials and methods:   Forty-six prostate cancer patients were scanned at 3T. Spectra were acquired with the point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) localization technique. Single-voxel spectra of four healthy volunteers were used to estimate T1 relaxation time of Spm. Spm, Cho concentrations, and ADC values of benign prostate tissues were correlated with Cit content.  Results:   The T1 value, 708 ± 132 msec, was estimated for Spm. Mean concentrations in the benign peripheral zone (PZ) were Cho, 4.5 ± 1 mM, Spm, 13.0 ± 4.4 mM, Cit, 64.4 ± 16.1 mM. Corresponding values in the benign central gland (CG) were Cho, 3.6 ± 1 mM, Spm, 13.3 ± 4.5 mM, Cit, 34.3 ± 12.9 mM.

The specific adherence is mediated by the VAR2CSA protein, which binds to placental chondroitin sulfate (CS) on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the placental syncytium. However, the identity of the CSPG core protein and the cellular impact of the interaction have remain elusive. In this study we identified the specific CSPG core protein to which the CS is attached, and characterized its exact placental location. VAR2CSA pull-down experiments using placental extracts from whole placenta or syncytiotrophoblast microvillous cell membranes showed three distinct CSPGs available for VAR2CSA adherence. Further examination of these three CSPGs by immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays showed that syndecan-1 is the main receptor for VAR2CSA mediated placental adherence. We further show that the commonly used placental choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo, express a different set of proteoglycans than those present on placental syncytiotrophoblast and may not be the most biologically relevant model to study placental malaria. Syncytial fusion of the BeWo cells, triggered by forskolin treatment, caused an increased expression of placental CS-modified syndecan-1.

In this study, we firstly conducted analysis of global lncRNA expression patterns by using our own cohort (GSE73397) and two public available gene expression datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE55909. Next, we performed microarray to observe genome-wide lncRNAs' expressions under dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation in LNCaP cells (GSE72866), and overlapped the result with ChIPBase data to predict androgen-responsive lncRNAs with ARE. Combined the two results, a total of 44 androgen-responsive lncRNAs with ARE were found to be over-expressed in PCa samples. Ten lncRNAs were selected for further validation by examining their expressions in LNCaP cells under DHT stimulation, and in PCa samples and cell lines. Among them, RP1-4514.2, LINC01138, SUZ12P1 and KLKP1 were validated as directly AR-targeted lncRNAs by ChIP-PCR. Then we conducted a bioinformatic analysis to identify lncRNAs as putative prognostic and therapeutic targets by using TCGA data. Three androgen-responsive lncRNAs, LINC01138, SUZ12P1 and SNHG1 showed association with gleason score and pT-stage.

A number of factors, both genetic and non-genetic, determine variation of serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations in the population. We have recently found three KLK3 deletions in individuals with very low prostate-specific antigen concentrations, suggesting a link between abnormally reduced KLK3 expression and deletions of KLK3. Here, we aim to determine the frequency of kallikrein gene 3 deletions in the general population. Methods The frequency of KLK3 deletions in the general population was estimated from the 1958 Birth Cohort sample ( n = 3815) using amplification ratiometry control system. In silico analyses using PennCNV were carried out in the same cohort and in NBS-WTCCC2 in order to provide an independent estimation of the frequency of KLK3 deletions in the general population. Results Amplification ratiometry control system results from the 1958 cohort indicated a frequency of KLK3 deletions of 0.81% (3.98% following a less stringent calling criterion). From in silico analyses, we found that potential deletions harbouring the KLK3 gene occurred at rates of 2.13% (1958 Cohort, n = 2867) and 0.99% (NBS-WTCCC2, n = 2737), respectively. These results are in good agreement with our in vitro experiments. All deletions found were in heterozygosis. Conclusions We conclude that a number of individuals from the general population present KLK3 deletions in heterozygosis.

Materials and method:   253 PC patients with bone metastases were prospectively randomized. All patients received baseline assessments including a dental panoramic tomogram. Group A was monitored and treated where deemed necessary by the patient's dentist and were re-evaluated once a year. In group B patients were monitored and treated where necessary by the authors at 12 week intervals. We compared the incidence rate per year (IR) and incidence proportion (IP) in both cohorts and assessed independent risk factors for BRONJ.  Results:   Patients in group A were evaluated 3.2 (range 2-4) vs. 6.8 times (range 4-24) in group B. A significantly higher proportion of dental extractions was performed in group B vs. A (26.7% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.006). A BRONJ was detected with an IP of 23.3% vs. 2.2% in group A vs. B, revealing a 2.59 fold higher relative risk for group A (p = 0.01, 95% CI 0.01-0.56). The IR in group A was 0.073 cases/year while the IR in group B was significantly decreased by 82% to 0.0131 (p < 0.001). Extraction therapy was the only independent risk factor for BRONJ (p < 0.0001; 95% CI 21.22-189.06).  Conclusions:   Preventive oral and maxillofacial treatment before bisphosphonate application combined with 3-monthly dental follow-ups significantly reduces the occurrence and risk of BRONJ in PC patients.

Using functional genomics we identified for the first time that Hsp27 regulates the gene signature of transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, which are negatively regulated by the Hippo Tumor Suppressor pathway. The Hippo pathway inactivates YAP by phosphorylating and increasing its cytoplasmic retention with the 14.3.3 proteins. Gain and loss of function experiments in prostate, breast and lung cancer cells showed that Hsp27 knockdown induced YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization while overexpression of Hsp27 displayed opposite results. Mechanistically, Hsp27 regulates the Hippo pathway by accelerating the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated MST1, the core Hippo kinase, resulting in reduced phosphorylation/activity of LATS1 and MOB1, its downstream effectors. Importantly, our in vitro results were supported by data from human tumors; clinically, high expression of Hsp27 in prostate tumors is correlated with increased expression of YAP gene signature and reduced phosphorylation of YAP in lung and invasive breast cancer clinical samples. This study reveals for the first time a link between Hsp27 and the Hippo cascade, providing a novel mechanism of deregulation of this tumor suppressor pathway across multiple cancers.""","""['Sepideh Vahid', 'Daksh Thaper', 'Kate F Gibson', 'Jennifer L Bishop', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Sphingosylphosphorylcholine regulates the Hippo signaling pathway in a dual manner.', 'Upregulation of miR-181c contributes to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway.', 'Regulation of Hippo pathway transcription factor TEAD by p38 MAPK-induced cytoplasmic translocation.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'YAP/TAZ for cancer therapy: opportunities and challenges (review).', 'Identification of Bone Metastatic and Prognostic Alternative Splicing Signatures in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Ponciri Fructus Immatarus Sensitizes the Apoptotic Effect of Hyperthermia Treatment in AGS Gastric Cancer Cells through ROS-Dependent HSP Suppression.', ""HSF1 and Its Role in Huntington's Disease Pathology."", 'Emerging Role of YAP and the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Interplay of Developmental Hippo-Notch Signaling Pathways with the DNA Damage Response in Prostate Cancer.']"""

RUNX2 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and modulates its transcriptional activity in a locus-specific manner. RUNX2 and AR synergistically stimulate a subset of genes, including the pro-oncogene snail family zinc finger 2 (SNAI2). AR-RUNX2 signaling cooperatively induces invasiveness of prostate cancer cells via SNAI2; and coexpression of AR, RUNX2, and SNAI2 in prostate cancer biopsy samples predicts disease recurrence. Competitive inhibition of AR alone could not disrupt the synergistic activation of SNAI2. We therefore established a phenotypic cell-based screening assay for compounds that could inhibit AR-RUNX2 synergistic activity either directly or indirectly. This assay was used to screen 880 compounds as a proof of concept, resulting in identification of several compounds that disrupted the synergistic stimulation of genes. Further investigation suggested the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in AR/RUNX2 synergistic activity.

Results:   Cancers were stiffer than benign PZ and TZ. All tissue classes were stiffer on sagittal than on axial imaging, in TZ than in PZ, and in median PZ than in lateral PZ.

Previously, we reported that ER stress-induced apoptosis is a critical host defense mechanism against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We sought to understand the role of Par-4 during ER stress-induced apoptosis in response to mycobacterial infection. Par-4 and GRP78 protein levels increased in response Mtb (strain: H37Ra) infection. Furthermore, Par-4 and GRP78 translocate to the surface of Mtb H37Ra-infected macrophages and induce apoptosis via caspase activation. NF-κB activation, Mtb-mediated ER stress, and Par-4 production were significantly diminished in macrophages with inhibited ROS production. To test Par-4 function during mycobacterial infection, we analyzed intracellular survival of Mtb H37Ra in macrophages with Par-4 overexpression or knockdown. Mtb H37Ra growth was significantly reduced in Par-4 overexpressing macrophages and increased in knockdown macrophages. We also observed increased Par-4, GRP78, and caspases activation in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-infected prostate cancer cells. Our data demonstrate that Par-4 is associated with ER stress-induced apoptosis resulting in reduced intracellular survival of mycobacteria.

In the last two decades members of the OR family were detected to be functional expressed in different parts of the human body such as in liver, prostate or intestine cancer cells. Here, we detected the expression of several ORs in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and in white blood cells of clinically diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. With calcium-imaging, we characterized in greater detail the cell biological role of one OR (OR2AT4) in leukemia. In both cell systems, the OR2AT4 agonist Sandalore-evoked strong Ca(2+) influx via the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-mediated pathway. The OR2AT4 antagonist Phenirat prevented the Sandalore-induced intracellular Ca(2+) increase. Western blot and flow cytometric experiments revealed that stimulation of OR2AT4 reduced the proliferation by decreasing p38-MAPK phosphorylation and induced apoptosis via phosphorylation of p44/42-MAPK. Furthermore, Sandalore increased the number of hemoglobin-containing cells in culture. We described for the first time an OR-mediated pathway in CML and AML that can regulate proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation after activation. This mechanism offers novel therapeutic options for the treatment of AML.""","""['S Manteniotis', 'S Wojcik', 'P Brauhoff', 'M Möllmann', 'L Petersen', 'J R Göthert', 'W Schmiegel', 'U Dührsen', 'G Gisselmann', 'H Hatt']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Death Discov""","""['Deorphanization and characterization of the ectopically expressed olfactory receptor OR51B5 in myelogenous leukemia cells.', 'OR2AT4, an Ectopic Olfactory Receptor, Suppresses Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence in Human Keratinocytes.', 'A synthetic sandalwood odorant induces wound-healing processes in human keratinocytes via the olfactory receptor OR2AT4.', 'Expression of FLT3 receptor and response to FLT3 ligand by leukemic cells.', 'Odorants could elicit repair processes in melanized neuronal and skin cells.', 'OR2AT4 and OR1A2 counterregulate molecular pathophysiological processes of steroid-resistant inflammatory lung diseases in human alveolar macrophages.', 'Olfactory Receptors as an Emerging Chemical Sensing Scaffold.', 'The regulatory landscape of retinoblastoma: a pathway analysis perspective.', 'Association between Olfactory Receptors and Skin Physiology.', 'Odorant receptors in cancer.']"""

Traditionally, the boost phase is planned independently from the primary plan with the risk of generating hot or cold spots in the composite plan. Alternatively, boost phase can be planned taking into account the primary dose. The aim of this study was to compare the composite plans from independently and dependently planned boosts using dosimetric and radiobiological metrics. Ten consecutive prostate patients previously treated at our institution were used to conduct this study on the Raystation™ 4.0 treatment planning system. For each patient, two composite plans were developed: a primary plan with an independently planned boost and a primary plan with a dependently planned boost phase. The primary plan was prescribed to 54 Gy in 30 fractions to the primary planning target volume (PTV1) which includes prostate and seminal vesicles, while the boost phases were prescribed to 24 Gy in 12 fractions to the boost planning target volume (PTV2) that targets only the prostate. PTV coverage, max dose, median dose, target conformity, dose homogeneity, dose to OARs, and probabilities of benefit, injury, and complication-free tumor control (P+) were compared. Statistical significance was tested using either a 2-tailed Student's t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Dosimetrically, the composite plan with dependent boost phase exhibited smaller hotspots, lower maximum dose to the target without any significant change to normal tissue dose. Radiobiologically, for all but one patient, the percent difference in the P+ values between the two methods was not significant. A large percent difference in P+ value could be attributed to an inferior primary plan. The benefits of considering the dose in primary plan while planning the boost is not significant unless a poor primary plan was achieved.""","""['Ganesh Narayanasamy', 'Gabrielle Avila', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Niko Papanikolaou', 'Alonso Gutierrez', 'Diana Baacke', 'Zheng Shi', 'Sotirios Stathakis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of non-exclusion of the rectum from the boost PTV in IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Dosimetric effect of photon beam energy on volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plan quality due to body habitus in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy as a boost to the prostate.', 'The simultaneous boost technique: the concept of relative normalized total dose.']"""

Then, we evaluated AR-V7 and changes of its target gene, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) which is an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in serial tumor biopsies from patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods:   We used RT-PCR and Q-PCR assay to evaluate AR-V7, androgen receptor full length (AR-FL), and UBE2C in tumor biopsies from patients with HSPC and CRPC. We examined associations between mRNA expression of AR-V7 and clinicopathologic factors. Furthermore, to identify other potential genes involved in the development of CRPC, RNA sequencing was conducted, using paired prostate cancer (PCa) tissues obtained immediately prior to treatment and at the time of therapeutic resistance.  Results:   A total of 13 HSPC patients and three CRPC patients were enrolled. Neither a high Gleason score (score of 8 and 9) nor a high risk of PCa (a high risk of locally advanced PCa according to NCCN guidelines) was correlated with mRNA expression of AR-V7 in HSPC (P = 0.153 and P = 0.215). The mRNA expression of AR-FL, but not AR-V7, was significantly associated with the mRNA expression of UBE2C level in HSPC (P = 0.007). However, increased expression of AR-V7, not AR-FL, paralleled increased expression of UBE2C in the CRPC specimens (P = 0.03). AR-V7 expression status before ADT was likely related to shorter CRPC development in patients treating ADT. The result of the RNA-sequencing analysis using serial samples from the same patient before and after castration demonstrated an increased level of the PI3K regulatory subunit 1 (P = 0.018).  Conclusion:   Our study revealed the role of UBE2C as a marker of the androgen signaling pathway in PCa. Differential gene expression analysis using serial samples from the same patient before and after castration revealed potential genes and pathways involved in development of CRPC. Further studies are needed to determine whether these genes and pathways are potential therapeutic target for CRPC.

Methods:   Next-generation sequencing, qRTPCR and immunoblot analysis revealed an elevated expression of a de novo purine biosynthetic gene, Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole Carboxylase, Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole Succinocarboxamide Synthetase (PAICS) in a progressive manner in prostate cancer. Functional analyses were performed using prostate cancer cell lines- DU145, PC3, LnCaP, and VCaP. The oncogenic properties of PAICS were studied both by transient and stable knockdown strategies, in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and murine xenograft models. Effect of BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 on the expression level of PAICS was also studied.  Results:   Molecular staging of prostate cancer is important factor in effective diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this study, we identified a de novo purine biosynthetic gene; PAICS is overexpressed in PCa and its expression correlated with disease aggressiveness. Through several in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we show that PAICS is necessary for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer cells. We identified JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor previously implicated in regulating MYC expression and demonstrated role in prostate cancer, abrogates PAICS expression in several prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we observe loss of MYC occupancy on PAICS promoter in presence of JQ1.  Conclusions:   Here, we report that evaluation of PAICS in prostate cancer progression and its role in prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion and suggest it as a valid therapeutic target. We suggest JQ1, a BET-domain inhibitor, as possible therapeutic option in targeting PAICS in prostate cancer.

We hypothesized that the advent of robotics and the establishment of certified prostate cancer centers caused centralization in the German radical prostatectomy market.  Methods:   Using remote data processing we analyzed the nationwide German billing data from 2006 to 2013. We supplemented this database with additional hospital characteristics like the prostate cancer center certification status. Inclusion criteria were a prostate cancer diagnosis combined with radical prostatectomy. Hospitals with certification or a surgical robot in 2009 were defined as 'early' group. Linear covariant-analytic models were applied to describe trends over time.  Results:   Annual radical prostatectomy numbers declined from 28 374 (2006) to 21 850 (2013). High-volume hospitals (⩾100 cases) decreased from 87 (22.0%) in 2006 to 43 (10.4%) in 2013. Low-volume hospitals (<50 cases) increased from 193 (48.7%) to 280 (67.4%). Mean radical prostatectomy caseloads of hospitals with early vs without certification declined from 155 to 130 vs 77 to 39 (P=0.021 for trend comparison). Early robotic hospitals maintained their volume >200 cases per year contrary to the overall trend (P<0.001 for trend comparison). A multivariate model for caseload numbers of 2013 indicated a robotic system to be the most important factor for higher caseloads (multiplication factor 7.3; 95% confidence interval: 6.6-8.0). A prostate cancer center certification (multiplication factor 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.50-1.59) had a much smaller impact.  Conclusions:   We found decentralization of radical prostatectomy in Germany. The driving force for this development might consist in the overall decline of radical prostatectomy numbers. The most important factor for achieving higher caseloads was the presence of a robotic system.

Prior research suggests mind-body techniques may improve these outcomes. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of qigong/tai chi (QGTC) in men with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy.  Methods:   Men with prostate cancer starting definitive radiation were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) QGTC; (2) light exercise (LE); or (3) waiting list control. Sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory) were assessed at baseline, midway through radiotherapy (T2), during the last week of radiotherapy (T3), and at 1 (T4) and 3 months (T5) after the end of radiotherapy. Patients in the QGTC and LE groups attended three 40-minute classes per week throughout radiotherapy.  Results:   Ninety patients were randomized to the 3 groups (QGTC = 26; LE = 26; waiting list control = 24). The QGTC group reported longer sleep duration midway through radiotherapy (QGTC = 7.01 h; LE = 6.42; WL = 6.50; P = .05), but this difference did not persist over time. There were no group differences in other domains of sleep or fatigue. Exploratory analyses conducted to examine the effect of health-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and American Urological Association Symptom score) on sleep and fatigue showed significant correlations across multiple domains.  Conclusions:   Qigong/tai chi during radiation for prostate cancer resulted in superior sleep duration midway through radiation, but this effect was not durable, and there were no differences in other domains of sleep or fatigue. Exploratory analysis demonstrated that both sleep and fatigue were highly correlated with prostate cancer-related physical symptoms.

Model development is motivated by the need to integrate multiple sources of data to improve clinical decisions about whether to remove or irradiate a patient's prostate cancer. Existing modeling approaches are extended to accommodate measurement error in cancer state determinations based on biopsied tissue, clinical measurements possibly not missing at random, and informative partial observation of the true state. The proposed model enables estimation of whether an individual's underlying prostate cancer is aggressive, requiring surgery and/or radiation, or indolent, permitting continued surveillance. These individualized predictions can then be communicated to clinicians and patients to inform decision-making. We demonstrate the model with data from a cohort of low-risk prostate cancer patients at Johns Hopkins University and assess predictive accuracy among a subset for whom true cancer state is observed. Simulation studies confirm model performance and explore the impact of adjusting for informative missingness on true state predictions.

Results:   The patients' ages were between 52 and 76, and 50 and 77 in groups 1 and 2, retrospectively. There were 69 and 66 patients in groups 1 and 2, retrospectively. The mean age of patients, PSA levels, PSA density, and prostate volumes were 63.89 ± 5.89 years, 5.82 ± 1.84 ng/ml, 0.14 ± 0.07 and 51.21 ± 31.75 cc (Group 1) and 65.77 ± 6.36 years, 13.65 ± 17.11 ng/ml, 0.63 ± 1.03 and 45.44 ± 26.77 cc (Group 2). T2a, T2c, T3a and T3b were reported in 28 patients, 36 patients, 3 patients and 2 patients after pathological evaluation in Group 1,respectively. T2a, T2c, T3a and T3b were reported in 13 patients, 47 patients, 5 patients and 1 patient in the other group, respectively.  Conclusion:   The final pathology showed that there is no difference in the positive surgical margin, proportion of insignificant prostate cancer and Gleason upgrading between groups.

Accumulating evidence suggests that PRMT5 may function as an oncogene to drive cancer cell growth by epigenetic inactivation of several tumor suppressors. Here, we provide evidence that PRMT5 promotes prostate cancer cell growth by epigenetically activating transcription of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of PRMT5 or inhibition of PRMT5 by a specific inhibitor reduces the expression of AR and suppresses the growth of multiple AR-positive, but not AR-negative, prostate cancer cells. Significantly, knockdown of PRMT5 in AR-positive LNCaP cells completely suppresses the growth of xenograft tumors in mice. Molecular analysis reveals that PRMT5 binds to the proximal promoter region of the AR gene and contributes mainly to the enriched symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 in the same region. Mechanistically, PRMT5 is recruited to the AR promoter by its interaction with Sp1, the major transcription factor responsible for AR transcription, and forms a complex with Brg1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, on the proximal promoter region of the AR gene. Furthermore, PRMT5 expression in prostate cancer tissues is significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, and PRMT5 expression correlates positively with AR expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, our results identify PRMT5 as a novel epigenetic activator of AR in prostate cancer. Given that inhibiting AR transcriptional activity or androgen synthesis remains the major mechanism of action for most existing anti-androgen agents, our findings also raise an interesting possibility that targeting PRMT5 may represent a novel approach for prostate cancer treatment by eliminating AR expression.""","""['X Deng', 'G Shao', 'H-T Zhang', 'C Li', 'D Zhang', 'L Cheng', 'B D Elzey', 'R Pili', 'T L Ratliff', 'J Huang', 'C-D Hu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 Promotes pICln-Dependent Androgen Receptor Transcription in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ERG signaling in prostate cancer is driven through PRMT5-dependent methylation of the Androgen Receptor.', 'Purification and identification of a novel complex which is involved in androgen receptor-dependent transcription.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'PRMT5: a putative oncogene and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'PRMT5 links lipid metabolism to contractile function of skeletal muscles.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with the snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'Research progress on PRMTs involved in epigenetic modification and tumour signalling pathway regulation (Review).', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'JNJ-64619178 radiosensitizes and suppresses fractionated ionizing radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer.']"""

The latter is characterised by the well-established histopathological Gleason grading system used in the current clinical care. Nevertheless, a large discrepancy exists on initial biopsy and after the final radical prostatectomy. Moreover, there is no reliable imaging modality to study these foci, in particular at the level of the cells and surrounding matrix. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling is significant in cancer progression with collagen as the dominant structural component providing mechanical strength and flexibility of tissue. In this study, the collagen assembly in prostate tissue was investigated with second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy: malignant foci demonstrated a reticular pattern, with a typical collagen pattern for each Gleason score. The orientation of collagen for each biopsy was computed by applying a ratio of the anisotropic and isotropic collagen fibres. This value was found to be distinct for each Gleason score.

However, the actions of AKBA in multidrug-resistant cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. The current study examined the reversal of MDR by AKBA in a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line with vincristine-induced resistance, HCT-8/VCR. A 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that cytotoxicity increased drastically and the IC50 of VCR in HCT-8/VCR cells decreased in the presence of AKBA. AKBA had a maximum ""fold reversal"" of MDR (FR) of 9.19-fold. In addition, HCT-8/VCR cells treated with AKBA and VCR exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic tumor cells according to flow cytometry. The reversal of MDR by AKBA was evident in an intracellular increase in Rhodamine (Rh123), indicating that the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was blocked. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the expression of P-gp and decreased levels of expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 in HCT-8/VCR cells.

Biopsy results, stratified by biopsy indication and PCA3 score, were recorded. Receiver operating characteristics curves and multivariable logistic regressions were used to model the association of PCA3 and mSS with cancer detection on MRF-TB.  Results:   PCA3 is associated with cancer detection on MRF-TB for men with no prior biopsies (area under the curve: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.76). Using a cutoff of ≥35, PCA3 was associated with cancer risk among men with mSS 2-3 (P = .004), but not among those with mSS 4-5 (P = .340). The interaction of PCA3 and mSS demonstrated significantly higher discrimination for cancer than mSS alone (area under the curve: 0.83 vs 0.79, P = .0434).  Conclusion:   Urinary PCA3 is associated with mSS and the detection of cancer on MRF-TB for men with no prior biopsies. PCA3 notably demonstrates a high negative predictive value among mSS 2-3.

Even with targeted therapeutic agent, bevacitumab, malignant glioma often develops resistance and recurrence. Thus, developing alternative interventions (therapeutic targets, biomarkers) is urgently required. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has been long implicated in B cell malignancies but surprisingly it has recently been shown to also play a tumorigenic role in solid tumors such as ovarian and prostate cancer. Bioinformatics data indicates that Btk is significantly higher in clinical glioma samples as compared to normal brain cells and Btk expression level is associated with stage progression. This prompts us to investigate the potential role of Btk as a therapeutic target for glioma. Here, we demonstrate Btk expression is associated with GBM tumorigenesis. Down-regulation of Btk in GBM cell lines showed a significantly reduced abilities in colony formation, migration and GBM sphere-forming potential. Mechanistically, Btk-silenced cells showed a concomitant reduction in the expression of CD133 and Akt/mTOR signaling. In parallel, Ibrutinib (a Btk inhibitor) treatment led to a similar anti-tumorigenic response. Using xenograft mouse model, tumorigenesis was significantly reduced in Btk-silenced or ibrutinib-treated mice as compared to control counterparts.

In the present study, the influence of miR-26a and miR-138 on EZH2 and cellular function including the impact on the cell cycle regulating network was evaluated in PCa cells.  Methods:   PC-3 and DU-145 PCa cells were transfected with 100 nM of miRNA mimics, siRNA against EZH2 (siR-EZH2) or control constructs for 4 h. Analyses of gene expression and cellular function were conducted 48 h after transfection.  Results:   Both miRNAs influenced the EZH2 expression and activity only marginally, whereas siR-EZH2 led to a notable decrease of the EZH2 expression and activity. Both miRNAs inhibited short- and/or long-term proliferation of PCa cells but showed no effect on viability and apoptosis. In PC-3 cells, miR-26a and miR-138 caused a significant surplus of cells in the G0/G1 phase of 6 and 12 %, respectively, thus blocking the G1/S-phase transition. Treatment with siR-EZH2 was without substantial influence on cellular function and cell cycle. Therefore, alternative target genes involved in cell cycle regulation were identified in silico. MiR-26a significantly diminished the expression of its targets CCNE1, CCNE2 and CDK6, whereas CCND1, CCND3 and CDK6 were suppressed by their regulator miR-138.  Conclusions:   The present findings suggest an anti-proliferative role for miR-26a and miR-138 in PCa by blocking the G1/S-phase transition independent of EZH2 but via a concerted inhibition of crucial cell cycle regulators.""","""['Kati Erdmann', 'Knut Kaulke', 'Christiane Rieger', 'Karsten Salomo', 'Manfred P Wirth', 'Susanne Fuessel']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['MiRNA-26a Contributes to the Acquisition of Malignant Behaviors of Doctaxel-Resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells through Targeting EZH2.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-144 Suppresses Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis by Targeting EZH2.', 'The long and short non-coding RNAs modulating EZH2 signaling in cancer.', 'Double sword role of EZH2 in leukemia.', 'The targets of aspirin in bladder cancer: bioinformatics analysis.', 'Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Breast Milk: MicroRNA Contents and Potential Epigenetic Effects.', 'DNA methylation of miR-138 regulates cell proliferation and EMT in cervical cancer by targeting EZH2.', 'miR-21 facilitates the diagnostic value of miR-138 for papillary thyroid cancer in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.', 'Human Prostate Tissue MicroRNAs and Their Predicted Target Pathways Linked to Prostate Cancer Risk Factors.']"""

The present study evaluated the relationship between miR-139-5p expression levels and prostate cancer (PCa), to assess the feasibility of using peripheral blood miR-139-5p as a potential non-invasive biomarker for PCa.  Methods:   Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 45 PCa patients, 45 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). The expression of miR-139-5p was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   MiR-139-5p in peripheral blood was significantly higher in PCa patients than in patients with BPH and HC individuals (P<0.001). Higher miR-139-5p expression was observed to be associated with certain clinicopathological parameters, including PSA>20ng/ml (P<0.05), pathological tumor stage 3/4 (P<0.05) and Gleason score >7 (P<0.01).

However, prolonged androgen deprivation results eventually in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with metastasis and poor survival. Emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may facilitate castration-resistance and cancer metastasis in PCa. The human androgen-dependent, castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) cell line LNCaP and the CRPC cell line C4-2 are often used as a model system for human PCa. However, the role of the AR and the effect of AR antagonist (antiandrogen) treatment on the RNA expression of key factors of EMT including the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) DRAIC in PCa cells remain elusive. Although as expected the established AR target genes PSA and FKBP5 are strongly induced by androgens in both cell lines, both E-cadherin and vimentin mRNA levels are upregulated by androgens in LNCaP but not in C4-2 cells by short- and long-term treatments. The mRNA levels of E-cadherin and vimentin remain unchanged by antiandrogen treatment in both cell lines. The expression of transcription factors that regulate EMT including Slug, Snail and ZEB1 and the lncRNA DRAIC were affected by androgen treatment in both cell lines. The mRNA level of Slug is upregulated by androgens and interestingly downregulated by antiandrogens in both cell lines. On the other hand, ZEB1 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated by androgens but remain unchanged by antiandrogens. In contrast, Snail mRNA levels are repressed by androgen treatment similar to DRAIC RNA levels. However, while antiandrogen treatment seems not to change Snail mRNA levels, antiandrogen treatments induce DRAIC RNA levels. Moreover, despite the strong upregulation of Zeb1 mRNA, no significant increase of the ZEB1 protein was observed indicating that despite androgen upregulation, posttranscriptional regulation of EMT controlling transcription factors occurs. SLUG protein was enhanced in both cell lines by androgens and reduced by antiandrogens. Taken together, our data suggest that the ligand-activated AR regulates the expression of several EMT key factors and antiandrogens counteract AR activity only on selected genes.""","""['Juliane Colditz', 'Benjamin Rupf', 'Caroline Maiwald', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'Crosstalk between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and castration resistance mediated by Twist1/AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The emerging potentials of lncRNA DRAIC in human cancers.', 'Histone Demethylase LSD1 Regulates Kidney Cancer Progression by Modulating Androgen Receptor Activity.', 'MicroRNA-100 functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer via downregulating the SATB1 expression and regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'LncRNA DRAIC inhibits proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells through interfering with NFRKB deubiquitination mediated by UCHL5.', 'Non-redundant functions of EMT transcription factors.']"""

Current prognostic variables, stage, and Gleason score have limitations in assessing treatment regimens for individual patients, especially in the intermediate-risk group of Gleason score 7. ERG:TMPRSS2 fusion and loss of PTEN are some of the most common genetic alterations in prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry of PTEN and ERG has generated interest as a promising method for more precise outcome prediction but requires further validation in population-based cohorts. We studied the predictive value of ERG and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry in two large radical prostatectomy cohorts comprising 815 patients with extensive follow-up information. Clinical end points were initiation of secondary therapy, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. Predictions of clinical outcomes were also assessed according to androgen receptor (AR) activity. PTEN loss, especially in ERG-negative cancers, predicted initiation of secondary treatments and shortened disease-specific survival time, as well as stratifying Gleason score 7 patients into different prognostic groups with regard to secondary treatments and disease-specific survival. High AR immunoreactivity in ERG-negative cancers with PTEN loss predicted worse disease-specific survival. We also observed that in Gleason score 7 ERG-negative cases with PTEN loss and high AR expression have significantly shorter disease-specific survival time compared with ERG-positive cases. Our conclusion is that loss of PTEN is a strong determining factor for shorter disease-specific survival time and initiation of secondary therapies after radical prostatectomy. The predictive value of PTEN immunoreactivity is further accentuated in ERG-negative cancers with high AR expression. Negative PTEN expression, accompanied by ERG status, can be used to stratify patients with Gleason score 7 into different survival groups.

Indeed, antagonists bind to a greater number of sst2 sites than agonists. Whether sst2 antagonists could be used successfully to target non-NETs, expressing low sst2 density, is unknown. Here, we compare quantitatively 125I-JR11 sst2 antagonist binding in vitro with that of the sst2 agonist 125I-Tyr3-octreotide in large varieties of non-NET and NET.  Methods:   In vitro receptor autoradiography was performed with 125I-JR11 and 125I-Tyr3-octreotide in cancers from prostate, breast, colon, kidney, thyroid, and lymphoid tissues as well as NETs as reference.  Results:   In general, 125I-JR11 binds to many more sst2 sites than 125I-Tyr3-octreotide. In 13 breast cancers, 8 had a low binding (mean density, 844 ± 168 dpm/mg of tissue) with the agonist whereas 12 had a high binding (mean density, 4,447 ± 1,128 dpm/mg of tissue) with the antagonist. All 12 renal cell cancers showed a low binding of sst2 with the agonist (mean density, 348 ± 49 dpm/mg of tissue) whereas all cases had a high sst2 binding with the antagonist (mean density, 3,777 ± 582 dpm/mg of tissue). One of 5 medullary thyroid cancers was positive with the agonist, whereas 5 of 5 were positive with the antagonist. In 15 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, many more sst2 sites were labeled with the antagonist than with the agonist. In 14 prostate cancers, none had sst2 binding with the agonist and only 4 had a weak binding with the antagonist. None of 17 colon cancers showed sst2 sites with the agonist, and only 3 cases were weakly positive with the antagonist. In the various tumor types, adjacent sst2-expressing tissues such as vessels, lymphocytes, nerves, mucosa, or stroma were more strongly labeled with the antagonist than with the agonist. The reference NET cases, incubated with a smaller amount of tracer, were also found to have many more sst2 sites measured with the antagonist.  Conclusion:   All renal cell cancers and most breast cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and medullary thyroid cancers represent novel indications for the in vivo radiopeptide targeting of sst2 by sst2 antagonists, comparable to NET radiotargeting with sst2 agonists.""","""['Jean Claude Reubi', 'Beatrice Waser', 'Helmut Mäcke', 'Jean Rivier']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Somatostatin Antagonists for Radioligand Therapy of Nonendocrine Tumors.', 'Evaluation of 177Lu-DOTA-sst2 antagonist versus 177Lu-DOTA-sst2 agonist binding in human cancers in vitro.', 'Somatostatin receptor sst1-sst5 expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues using receptor autoradiography with subtype-selective ligands.', 'SSTR-Mediated Imaging in Breast Cancer: Is There a Role for Radiolabeled Somatostatin Receptor Antagonists?', 'Somatostatin Receptor Antagonists for Imaging and Therapy.', 'Distribution of somatostatin receptors in normal and neoplastic human tissues: recent advances and potential relevance.', 'Peptide Radioligands in Cancer Theranostics: Agonists and Antagonists.', 'Theranostics of Primary Prostate Cancer: Beyond PSMA and GRP-R.', 'Current status and future of targeted peptide receptor radionuclide positron emission tomography imaging and therapy of gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma: a new way forward.', 'Diagnostic Value of Radiolabelled Somatostatin Analogues for Neuroendocrine Tumour Diagnosis: The Benefits and Drawbacks of 64CuCu-DOTA-TOC.']"""

By using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we evaluated the intratumoral DHT synthesis from 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-diol), which is inactive androgen metabolized from DHT. 3β-diol had biochemical potential to be converted to DHT via three metabolic pathways and could stimulate PC cell growth. Especially, 3β-diol was not only converted back to upstream androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or Δ5-androstenediol but also converted directly to DHT which is the main pathway from 3β-diol to DHT. Abiraterone had a significant influence on the metabolism of DHEA, epiandrosterone and 3β-diol, by the inhibition of the intratumoural 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) activities which is one of key catalysts in androgen metabolic pathway. The direct-conversion of 3β-diol to DHT was catalysed by 3β-HSD and abiraterone could inhibit this activity of 3β-HSD. These results suggest that PC had a mechanism of intratumoural androgen metabolism to return inactive androgen to active androgen and intratumoural DHT synthesis from 3β-diol is important as one of the mechanisms of castration resistance in PC.

Patients and methods:   We identified 29 571 patients aged 66-75 years without significant comorbidity from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database who were diagnosed with localised prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009. We compared the rates of all-cause and treatment-related hospitalisation that occurred within 365 days of the initiation of definitive therapy. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify determinants associated with hospitalisation.  Results:   Men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) rather than radiotherapy (RT) had lower odds of being hospitalised for any cause after therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.87]. Patients who underwent RP rather than RT had higher odds of being hospitalised for treatment-related complications (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29). However, men who underwent external beam RT (EBRT)/intensity modulated RT (IMRT) (OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.99) had a 16% lower odds of hospitalisation from treatment-related complications than patients undergoing RP. Using propensity score-weighted analyses there was no significant difference in the odds of hospitalisation from treatment-related complications for men who underwent RP vs RT (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.92-1.21). Patients hospitalised for treatment-related complications after RT were costlier than patients who underwent RP (Mean $18 381 vs $13 203, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   With the exception of men who underwent EBRT/IMRT, there was no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalisation from treatment-related complications.

All were physician members of the NCCN guideline committees for lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer as of the end of 2014. The data source for FCOIs was Open Payments, which is publically reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This study was cross-sectional.  Main outcomes and measures:   The proportion of NCCN authors having FCOIs with industry; the average amount received from industry sources per author.  Results:   Of 125 guideline authors, 108 (86%) had at least 1 reported FCOI. Authors received an average of $10 011 (range, $0-$106 859) in general payments (GPs), which include consulting, meals, lodging, and similar transfers of value, and $236 066 (range $0-$2 756 713) in industry research payments (RPs), including funding associated with clinical trials. Approximately 84% of authors received GPs, while 47% received RPs. Eight (6%) had FCOIs in excess of the $50 000 net and/or $20 000 single-company maximums stipulated by NCCN.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among NCCN guideline authors, FCOIs involving RPs were of greater value, while those involving GPs were more prevalent.

It is unknown whether it is beneficial for patients to continue treatment upon 6 cycles.  Objective:   To investigate whether the number of docetaxel cycles administered to patients deriving clinical benefit was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in a post hoc analysis of the Mainsail trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Mainsail trial was a multinational randomized phase 3 study of 1059 patients with mCRPC receiving docetaxel, prednisone, and lenalidomide (DPL) or docetaxel, prednisone, and a placebo (DP). Study patients were treated until progressive disease or unacceptable adverse effects occurred. Median OS was found to be inferior in the DPL arm compared with the DP arm. As a result of increased toxic effects with the DPL combination, patients on DPL received fewer docetaxel cycles (median, 6) vs 8 cycles in the control group. As the dose intensity was comparable in both treatment arms, we investigated whether the number of docetaxel cycles administered to patients deriving clinical benefit on Mainsail was an independent prognostic factor for OS. We conducted primary univariate and multivariate analyses for the intention-to-treat population. Additional sensitivity analyses were done, excluding patients who stopped treatment for reasons of disease progression and those who received 4 or fewer cycles of docetaxel for other reasons, minimizing the effect of confounding factors.  Main outcomes and measures:   Total number of docetaxel cycles delivered as an independent factor for OS.  Results:   Overall, all 1059 patients from the Mainsail trial were included (mean [SD] age, 68.7 [7.89] years). Treatment with 8 or more cycles of docetaxel was associated with superior OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.909; 95% CI, 1.660-2.194; P < .001), irrespective of lenalidomide treatment (HR, 1.060; 95% CI, 0.924-1.215; P = .41). Likewise, in the sensitivity analysis, patients who received a greater number of docetaxel cycles had superior OS; patients who received more than 10 cycles had a median OS of 33.0 months compared with 26.9 months in patients treated with 8 to 10 cycles; and patients who received 5 to 7 cycles had a median OS of 22.8 months (P < .001).

We hypothesized that specialty bias would manifest in all settings, trumping available evidence.  Methods:   A survey of practicing urologists and radiation oncologists was distributed through electronic mail. Questions pertained to upfront management, postoperative treatment, and local salvage for postradiation BCRs. The associations between 26 selected categorical responses and specialty were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Training level/expertise, practice setting, percentage of consultation caseload consisting of prostate cancer, and nationality were set as effect modifiers.  Results:   One thousand two hundred fifty-three physicians (846 radiation oncologists and 407 urologists) completed the survey. Radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend adjuvant RT and consider it to be underutilized, and more likely to recommend salvage RT at lower prostate-specific antigen thresholds (P<0.0001). Urologists were more likely to recommend salvage radical prostatectomy or cryoablation for local salvage after RT, whereas radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend RT-based modalities and more likely to report that local salvage was underutilized after RT (P<0.0001). Urologists were more likely to report that upfront radical prostatectomy was a better definitive treatment (P<0.0001), whereas radiation oncologists were more likely to report the opposite (P=0.005).

LncRNA CCAT2 is a novel identified lncRNA that was previously reported to be up-regulated in different cancers, however, its role in prostate cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and role of lncRNA CCAT2 in prostate cancer. The expression levels of lncRNA CCAT2 in PCa tissues and cell lines (DU145 and 22RV1) were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and its association with prognosis of patients was analyzed by statistical analysis. Furthermore, the effect of CCAT2 on proliferation, migration, and invasion was studied in PCa cells. We found that the expression level of CCAT2 was higher in PCa tissues and cells compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal prostate stromal immortalized cells WPMY-1. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with high CCAT2 expression level had poorer overall survival and progression-free survival than those with low CCAT2 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that the status of CCAT2 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for this disease. We also found that knockdown of CCAT2 could inhibit cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro. In addition, knockdown of CCAT2 stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through abrogating N-cadherin, vimentin expression and intensifing the expression levels of E-cadherin. In conclusion, our data suggested that lncRNA CCAT2 was a novel molecule involved in PCa progression, which provided a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for new therapies in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Jinfeng Zheng', 'Shaoxiong Zhao', 'Xiaolong He', 'Zhili Zheng', 'Weibin Bai', 'Youlin Duan', 'Shanlin Cheng', 'Juncai Wang', 'Xucheng Liu', 'Gang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['The long non-coding RNA CCAT2 is up-regulated in ovarian cancer and associated with poor prognosis.', 'Long non-coding RNA CCAT2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer and associated with poor prognosis.', 'Overexpression of long non-coding RNA LOC400891 promotes tumor progression and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Roles of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent advances in machine learning methods for predicting LncRNA and disease associations.', 'Long non-coding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 2: role and function in human cancers.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Upregulation of lncRNA SUMO1P3 promotes proliferation, invasion and drug resistance in gastric cancer through interacting with the CNBP protein.', 'The Roles of the Colon Cancer Associated Transcript 2 (CCAT2) Long Non-Coding RNA in Cancer: A Comprehensive Characterization of the Tumorigenic and Molecular Functions.']"""

We present here a unique case of gastroesophageal carcinoma with metastasis to the rectum. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old female patient presented with constipation, bloating, and weight loss of 4-month duration. She had undergone sleeve gastrectomy 6 years before. Endoscopies performed revealed a friable-looking mucosa in the lower esophagus and a polypoid rectal mass. Histopathological examination from both the esophageal and rectal lesions revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells. Immunohistochemistry stain from both specimens was positive for CK7 supporting the gastric site primary with metastasis to the rectum. Further evaluation also revealed metastasis to bone and malignant pleural effusion. Chemotherapy with palliative intent was initiated. CONCLUSIONS Colorectal metastasis is commonly seen from cancers of the breast, stomach, melanoma, kidney, prostate, and ovaries. However, colorectal metastasis from gastroesophageal cancer has never been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis relies on histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining of the tumor. Treatment depends on the tumor stage. Tumors with widespread metastatic disease are candidates for palliative chemotherapy.""","""['Jasbir Makker', 'Niraj Karki', 'Binita Sapkota', 'Masooma Niazi', 'Prospere Remy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""['Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Methods:   We applied competing risk survival models to administrative data from the Queensland Cancer Registry (Australia) for men diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 2005 and July 2007, including stratification by Gleason score.  Results:   The men (n = 7393) in the study cohort had a median follow-up of 5 years 3 months. After adjustment, remoteness and area-level disadvantage were not significantly associated with prostate cancer mortality. However, area-level disadvantage had a significant negative relationship with hazard of death from a cause other than prostate cancer within 7 years; compared with those living in the most advantaged areas, the likelihood of mortality was higher for those in the most disadvantaged (subhazard ratio [SHR] = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.90; P = 0.041), disadvantaged (SHR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.14-2.00; P = 0.004), middle (SHR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75; P = 0.034) and advantaged areas (SHR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.89; P = 0.009). Those with Gleason score of 7 and higher had a lower hazard of prostate cancer mortality if they were living with a partner, whereas those with lower Gleason scores and living a partner had lower hazards of other-cause mortality.

However, telmisartan comprised 85% of the data in the original meta-analysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether the use of telmisartan, compared with other ARBs, is associated with an increased risk of cancer.  Methods:   We used the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assemble a cohort of all patients newly treated with ARBs between 2000 and 2008, and followed until December 2010. Time-dependent cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer associated with telmisartan, compared with other ARBs, adjusted for potential confounders. Secondary analyses assessed the risk with each of the 4 most common cancers (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal).  Results:   The cohort consisted of 62,109 new ARB users, which included 3,438 telmisartan and 58,671 other ARB users. Compared with other ARBs, telmisartan use was not associated with an increased risk of cancer overall (16.3 vs. 15.0 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.81-1.06) or by cancer site (lung, HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.55-1.51; breast, HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.90-1.82; prostate, HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.53-1.18; colorectal, HR: 1.41, 95% CI 0.95-2.10).

While PET/CT using 11C-choline was considered as the gold standard in the staging of prostate cancer, PET with radiolabelled PSMA ligands was introduced into the clinic in recent years. Our aim was to compare the PSMA ligand 68Ga-PSMA-11 with 11C-choline in patients with primary and recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   123 patients underwent a whole-body PET/CT examination using 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 11C-choline. Suspicious lesions were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively (SUVavg). Out of these, 103 suffered from a confirmed biochemical relapse after prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy (mean PSA level of 4.5 ng/ml), while 20 patients underwent primary staging.  Results:   In 67 patients with biochemical relapse, we detected 458 lymph nodes suspicious for metastasis. PET using 68Ga-PSMA-11 showed a significantly higher uptake and detection rate than 11C-choline PET. Also 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET identified significantly more patients with suspicious lymph nodes as well as affected lymph nodes regions especially at low PSA levels. Bone lesions suspicious for prostate cancer metastasis were revealed in 36 patients' biochemical relapse. Significantly more bone lesions were detected by 68Ga-PSMA-11, but only 3 patients had only PSMA-positive bone lesions. Nevertheless, we detected also 29 suspicious lymph nodes and 8 bone lesions, which were only positive as per 11C-choline PET. These findings led to crucial differences in the TNM classification and the identification of oligometastatic patients. In the patients who underwent initial staging, all primary tumors showed uptake of both tracers. Although significantly more suspicious lymph nodes and bone lesions were identified, only 2 patients presented with bone lesions only detected by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.  Conclusion:   Thus, PET using 68Ga-PSMA-11 showed a higher detection rate than 11C-choline PET for lymph nodes as well as bone lesions.

We examined how type and duration of ADT affects risk of T2DM. Using data from Prostate Cancer database Sweden (PCBaSe) we investigated risk of T2DM in a cohort of 34,031 men with PCa on ADT; i.e., anti-androgens (AA), orchiectomy, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists compared to an age-matched, PCa-free comparison cohort (n = 167,205) using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. T2DM was defined as a newly filled prescription for metformin, sulphonylurea, or insulin in the Prescribed Drug Register. A total of 21,874 men with PCa received GnRH agonists, 9,143 AA and 3,014 underwent orchiectomy. Risk of T2DM was increased in men in the GnRH agonists/orchiectomy group during the first 3 years of ADT [i.e., 1 - 1.5 years HR: 1.61 (95%CI: 1.36 - 1.91)], compared to PCa-free men.

We applied flow cytometry sorting of side population cells to cultures of prostate cancer cell lines (TSU, DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP). The proportion of SP cells in the TSU line was 1.60±0.40% (mean ± SD), while that of the DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP lines was 0.60±0.05, 0.80±0.05 and 0.60±0.20%, respectively. Because the proportion of SP cells derived from TSU cells is greater, these cells were selected to sort side population cells and non-side population cells. The stem-like properties of SP cells had been identified by in vivo and in vitro experiments, and the related study was published. RNA was extracted from the SP cells and non-SP cells and analyzed using miRNA microarray technology. Fifty-three miRNAs with significant differences in their expression were detected in total. Furthermore, 20 of these miRNAs were validated by qPCR. We found that hsa-miR‑149 expression in SP cells and non-SP cells was significantly different; hsa-miR-149 was significantly upregulated in SP cells. By constructing a vector for lentiviral infection, we found that the downregulation of hsa-miR-149 leads to a reduction in proliferation, an increase in apoptosis, and a significant reduction in the colony formation potential, thus, inhibiting tumor growth in vivo of SP cells from the TSU cell line.

Data from November 1995 to May 2013 were extracted from a prospectively collected database. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival, and secondary outcomes were overall survival, cause specific survival and treatment-free survival.  Results:   A total of 213 intermediate risk and 732 low risk cases were identified. Median age was 72 years (IQR 67.3, 76.8) in the intermediate risk cohort and 67 years (IQR 60.6, 71.9) in the low risk group.

Results:   Among all screening encounters with a suspicious digital rectal examination only 15.4% had a concurrently abnormal prostate specific antigen (McNemar's test p <0.001). During followup there were 1,612 clinically significant prostate cancers detected, 64 prostate cancer specific deaths and 4,600 deaths. On multivariable analysis suspicious digital rectal examination and abnormal prostate specific antigen were associated with a greater risk of clinically significant prostate cancer (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.99-2.44 vs HR 5.48, 95% CI 5.05-5.96, p <0.001 and p <0.001) and prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.41-4.58 vs HR 5.23, 95% CI 3.08-8.88, p=0.002 and p <0.001), respectively.  Conclusions:   In a secondary analysis of a contemporary U.S. cohort, suspicious digital rectal examination and abnormal prostate specific antigen on routine screening were independently associated with clinically significant prostate cancer and prostate cancer specific mortality.

According to the free hormone hypothesis, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) determines free and bioavailable testosterone concentrations. Previous studies have suggested that in vitro androgen bioassay results may also be influenced by SHBG and correlate with free or bioavailable testosterone concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we established a stable HEK293 cell line with high expression of the human androgen receptor (AR) and a luciferase reporter downstream of a classical androgen response element. Importantly, we demonstrate that bioassay results are sensitive to dilution effects which increase apparent bioactivity in an SHBG-dependent manner. We therefore adopted a method using undiluted serum, which reduced cell proliferation but did not significantly affect the luciferase signal, cell viability or cytotoxicity. To correct for serum matrix effects, we applied signal correction based on internal controls with AR agonists or antagonists. Using this method, we provide direct evidence that in vitro androgen bioactivity reflects the inhibitory effects of SHBG, and correlates with free or bioavailable testosterone concentrations in adult hypogonadal men receiving androgen replacement therapy. In men receiving anti-androgens, serum bioactivity decreased tenfold while serum testosterone concentrations decreased only four-fold. Further pilot results in prostate cancer patients showed that androgen synthesis inhibitors result in more complete inhibition of androgen bioactivity than gonadorelin-based androgen deprivation therapy, even in patients whose testosterone concentrations were undetectable by mass spectrometry. We conclude that in vitro androgen reporter bioassays are useful tools to study how androgen bioactivity in serum is determined by androgens, anti-androgens as well as SHBG, provided that dilution and matrix effects are accounted for.""","""['Michaël R Laurent', 'Christine Helsen', 'Leen Antonio', 'Dieter Schollaert', 'Steven Joniau', 'Michel J Vos', 'Brigitte Decallonne', 'Geoffrey L Hammond', 'Dirk Vanderschueren', 'Frank Claessens']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Sex hormone-binding globulin regulation of androgen bioactivity in vivo: validation of the free hormone hypothesis.', 'Serum androgens and sex hormone-binding globulins in relation to lifestyle factors in older African-American, white, and Asian men in the United States and Canada.', 'Sex hormone-binding globulin is associated with androgen deficiency features independently of total testosterone.', 'Contribution of bioavailable testosterone assay for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency in elderly men.', 'Sex hormone binding globulin: origin, function and clinical significance.', 'Menopause, androgens, and cardiovascular ageing: a narrative review.', 'Role of sex hormone-binding globulin in the free hormone hypothesis and the relevance of free testosterone in androgen physiology.', 'Interaction between mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and retinoic acid alters Sertoli cell development during fetal mouse testis cord morphogenesis.', 'Effects of testosterone on skin structure and factors related to androgen conversion and binding in Hetian sheep.', 'Preterm infant circulating sex steroid levels are not altered by transfusion with adult male plasma: a retrospective multicentre cohort study.']"""

We postulated that men inheriting the HSD3B1 (1245C) allele would exhibit resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   In this multicohort study, we determined HSD3B1 genotype retrospectively in men treated with ADT for post-prostatectomy biochemical failure and correlated genotype with long-term clinical outcomes. We used data and samples from prospectively maintained prostate cancer registries at the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH, USA; primary study cohort) and the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA; post-prostatectomy and metastatic validation cohorts). In the post-prostatectomy cohorts, patients of any age were eligible if they underwent prostatectomy between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2009 (at the Cleveland Clinic; primary cohort), or between Jan 1, 1987, and Dec 31, 2011 (at the Mayo Clinic; post-prostatectomy cohort) and were treated with ADT for biochemical failure or for non-metastatic clinical failure. In the metastatic validation cohort, patients of any age were eligible if they were enrolled at Mayo Clinic between Sept 1, 2009, and July 31, 2013, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to HSD3B1 genotype. We did prespecified multivariable analyses to assess the independent predictive value of HSD3B1 genotype on outcomes.  Findings:   We included and genotyped 443 patients: 118 in the primary cohort (who underwent prostatectomy), 137 in the post-prostatectomy validation cohort, and 188 in the metastatic validation cohort. In the primary study cohort, median progression-free survival diminished as a function of the number of variant alleles inherited: 6·6 years (95% CI 3·8-not reached) in men with homozygous wild-type genotype, 4·1 years (3·0-5·5) in men with heterozygous variant genotype, and 2·5 years (0·7 to not reached) in men with homozygous variant genotype (p=0·011). Relative to the homozygous wild-type genotype, inheritance of two copies of the variant allele was predictive of decreased progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2·4 [95% CI 1·1-5·3], p=0·029), as was inheritance of one copy of the variant allele (HR 1·7 [1·0-2·9], p=0·041). Findings were similar for distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival. The effect of the HSD3B1 genotype was independently confirmed in the validation cohorts.  Interpretation:   Inheritance of the HSD3B1 (1245C) allele that enhances dihydrotestosterone synthesis is associated with prostate cancer resistance to ADT. HSD3B1 could therefore potentially be a powerful genetic biomarker capable of distinguishing men who are a priori likely to fare favourably with ADT from those who harbour disease liable to behave more aggressively, and who therefore might warrant early escalated therapy.

(99m)Tc-TCP-1 was generated by modifying TCP-1 with succinimidyl-6-hydrazino-nicotinamide (S-HYNIC) followed by radiolabeling. In vitro saturation binding experiments were performed for (99m)Tc-TCP-1 in human HCT116 colon cancer cells. SCID mice with human HCT116 cancer xenografts were imaged with (99m)Tc-TCP-1 or control peptide using a small-animal SPECT imager: Group I (n=5) received no blockade; Group II (n=5) received a blocking dose of non-radiolabeled TCP-1. Group III (n=5) were imaged with (99m)Tc-labeled control peptide (inactive peptide). SCID mice with human PC3 prostate cancer xenografts (Group IV, n=5) were also imaged with (99m)Tc-TCP-1. Eight additional SCID mice bearing HCT116 xenografts in dorsal skinfold window chambers (DSWC) were imaged by direct positron imaging of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and fluorescence microscopy of Cy7-TCP-1. In vitro(99m)Tc-HYNIC-TCP-1 binding assays on HCT 116 cells indicated a mean Kd of 3.04±0.52nM. In cancer xenografts, (99m)Tc-TCP-1 radioactivity (%ID/g) was 1.01±0.15 in the absence of blockade and was reduced to 0.26±0.04 (P<0.01) with blockade. No radioactive uptake was observed in the PC3 tumors with (99m)Tc-TCP-1 or HCT116 tumors with inactive peptide. Cy7-TCP-1 activity localized not only in metabolically active tumors, as defined by (18)F-FDG imaging, but also in peritumoral microvasculature.

As many of the studies evaluating MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy were conducted in specialized quaternary care centers, the question remains whether this technology is transferable to general practice. Our study assesses the diagnostic ability of MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy compared with standard biopsy in the new era of prostate cancer Grade Grouping. We reviewed our prostate biopsy database evaluating men who underwent MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy with concurrent standard 12-core extended-sextant biopsy. Patient demographics and pathologic findings were reviewed. All patient biopsies were performed by 1 of 2 urologic oncologists. Tumors were given a Grade Group for each biopsy based on the core with the highest grade in each case. A total of 191 patients underwent MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy with concurrent 12-core extended sextant biopsy, with a cancer detection rate of 56%. The average number of biopsy cores obtained via the targeted approach was significantly less than those obtained by standard biopsy, 4.8 cores versus 12 cores, respectively, P<0.001. There was no difference in cancer detection between targeted and standard biopsy, 41.4% and 49.2%, respectively, P=0.15. However, when comparing the 2 techniques, the degree of detection of ≥Grade Group 3 tumors significantly favored targeted biopsy over standard biopsy (P=0.009).

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Complete information on PSA, PSA density (PSAD), clinical stage, percentage of positive cores, percentage of maximum surface specimen involvement, and RP pathology were available. GS upgrade and downgrade, non-organ-confined and non-specimen-confined disease, unfavorable disease (pT3-T4 and/or pN1 and/or a pGS ≥4 + 3) were the outcomes. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 156 patients (13.1%) experienced GS upgrade; 201 (16.9%) were downgraded. Overall, 205 men (17.2%) harbored non-organ-confined disease, and 295 (24.8%) had unfavorable disease. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06), percentage surface involvement (OR: 1.01), and PSAD (OR: 1.83) were the only significant predictors of upgrade. Age (OR: 1.05), clinical stage (OR: 1.74), percentage of positive cores >50% (OR 1.57), percentage of surface area (OR: 1.02), and perineural invasion (OR: 1.89) were significant predictors of unfavorable disease at RP. The retrospective design is a limitation.  Conclusions:   AS is a possible option for a subset of men with FIR GS 3 + 4. However, clinical models alone have a limited role in GS upgrade prediction, and alternative tools warrant further investigation.  Patient summary:   Patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 at biopsy, low prostate-specific antigen, and low stage might consider the option of active surveillance, but the use of clinical information alone might be not adequate for thorough risk-adapted counseling.""","""['Alessandro Morlacco', 'John C Cheville', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Derek J Gearman', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Alessandro Morlacco, John C.

Materials including 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, carboxyl-modified 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and polyethyleneglycol-2000 were for mechanical oscillation, and nanobubbles were obtained through the centrifugal flotation method. After mice were injected with nanobubbles, abdominal color Doppler blood flow imaging significantly improved. Through left ventricular perfusion with normal saline to empty the circulating nanobubbles, nanobubbles still existed in tumor tissue sections, which demonstrated that nanobubbles could enter tissue spaces via the permeability and retention effect. Fluorinated A10-3.2 aptamers obtained by chemical synthesis had good specificity for PSMA-positive cells, and were linked with carboxyl-modified 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine lipid molecules from the outer shell of nanobubbles via amide reaction to construct targeted nanobubbles. Gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence confirmed that targeted nanobubbles were fabricated successfully. Next, targeted nanobubbles could bind with PSMA-positive cells (C4-2 cells), while not with PSMA-negative cells (PC-3 cells), using in vitro binding experiments and flow cytometry at the cellular level. Finally, C4-2 and PC-3 xenografts in mice were used to observe changes in parameters of targeted and non-targeted nanobubbles in the contrast-enhanced ultrasound mode, and the distribution of Cy5.5-labeled targeted nanobubbles in fluorescent imaging of live small animals. Comparison of ultrasound indicators between targeted and non-targeted nanobubbles in C4-2 xenografts showed that they had similar peak times (P>0.05), while the peak intensity, half time of peak intensity, and area under the curve of ½ peak intensity were significantly different (P<0.05). In PC-3 xenografts, there were no differences in these four indicators. Fluorescent imaging indicated that targeted nanobubbles had an aggregation ability in C4-2 xenograft tumors.

Herein, we report the development of a glucose conjugate of triptolide, named glutriptolide, which was intended to target tumor cells overexpressing glucose transporters selectively. Glutriptolide did not inhibit XPB activity in vitro but demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity against tumor cells over normal cells with greater water solubility than triptolide. Furthermore, it exhibited remarkable tumor control in vivo, which is likely due to sustained stepwise release of active triptolide within cancer cells.

There is uncertainty as to which patients benefit from genomic testing and for whom these tests should be ordered. Here, we examined the correlation patterns of Decipher assay to understand the relationship between the Decipher and patient tumor characteristics.  Methods:   De-identified Decipher test results (including Decipher risk scores and clinicopathologic data) from 2 342 consecutive radical prostatectomy (RP) patients tested between January and September 2015 were analyzed. For clinical testing, tumor specimen from the highest Gleason grade was sampled using a 1.5 mm tissue punch. Decipher scores were calculated based on a previously locked model. Correlations between Decipher score and clinicopathologic variables were computed using Spearman's rank correlation. Mixed-effect linear models were used to study the association of practice type and Decipher score. The significance level was 0.05 for all tests.  Results:   Decipher score had a positive correlation with pathologic Gleason score (PGS; r=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.41), pathologic T-stage (r=0.31, 95% CI 0.28-0.35), CAPRA-S (r=0.32, 95% CI 0.28-0.37) and patient age (r=0.09, 95% CI 0.05-0.13). Decipher reclassified 52%, 76% and 40% of patients in CAPRA-S low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. We detected a 28% incidence of high-risk disease through the Decipher score in pT2 patients and 7% low risk in pT3b/pT4, PGS 8-10 patients. There was no significant difference in the Decipher score between patients from community centers and those from academic centers (P=0.82).  Conclusions:   Although Decipher correlated with baseline tumor characteristics for over 2 000 patients, there was significant reclassification of tumor aggressiveness as compared to clinical parameters alone. Utilization of the Decipher genomic classifier can have major implications in assessment of postoperative risk that may impact physician-patient decision making and ultimately patient management.""","""['R B Den', 'M Santiago-Jimenez', 'J Alter', 'M Schliekelman', 'J R Wagner', 'J F Renzulli Ii', 'D I Lee', 'C G Brito', 'K Monahan', 'B Gburek', 'N Kella', 'G Vallabhan', 'F Abdollah', 'E J Trabulsi', 'C D Lallas', 'L G Gomella', 'T L Woodlief', 'Z Haddad', 'L L C Lam', 'S Deheshi', 'Q Wang', 'V Choeurng', 'M du Plessis', 'J Jordan', 'B Parks', 'H Shin', 'C Buerki', 'K Yousefi', 'E Davicioni', 'V R Patel', 'N L Shah']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis of the Performance of the Decipher Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Men After Prostatectomy to Predict Development of Metastatic Disease.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Association between Expression of Connective Tissue Genes and Prostate Cancer Growth and Progression.', 'Fusion Gene Detection in Prostate Cancer Samples Enhances the Prediction of Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes from Radical Prostatectomy through Machine Learning in a Multi-Institutional Analysis.', 'Differences in Prostate Cancer Transcriptomes by Age at Diagnosis: Are Primary Tumors from Older Men Inherently Different?', 'Association between Incidental Pelvic Inflammation and Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular risk classifier score and biochemical recurrence risk are associated with cribriform pattern type in Gleason 3+4=7 prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We performed multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging on freshly excised human prostate specimens taken from a total of 30 patients undergoing prostatectomy for biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. Histologic slides marked by a genitourinary pathologist were used as ground truth to define regions of interest (ROIs) in the photoacoustic images. Primarily, 3 different prostate tissue categories, namely malignant, BPH, and normal, were considered, while a fourth category named nonmalignant was formed by combining the ROIs corresponding to BPH and normal tissue together. We extracted 3 spectral parameters, namely slope, midband fit, and intercept, from power spectra of the radiofrequency photoacoustic signals corresponding to the 3 primary tissue categories.  Results:   We analyzed data from 53 ROIs selected from the photoacoustic images of 30 patients. According to the histopathologic analysis, 19 ROIs were malignant, 8 were BPH, and 26 were normal.

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of FOXQ1 in regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer and the underlying mechanism. We found that FOXQ1 was highly expressed in the prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. In our FOXQ1 loss-of-function experiments, the data indicate that the expression of BCL11A and MDM2 was significantly downregulated, prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion were markedly suppressed, and apoptosis was significantly induced. Moreover, overexpression of BCL11A obviously reversed the effect of FOXQ1 inhibition on apoptosis, proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In addition, BCL11A overexpression also abrogated the inhibitory effect of FOXQ1 suppression on MDM2 expression.

However, whether cabazitaxel may inhibit the proliferation of other tissue‑derived cancer cells, and its underlying mechanism, remains unknown. In the present study, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line was exposed to cabazitaxel, in order to investigate its cytotoxic effect and determine the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that cabazitaxel was able to induce autophagy in A549 cells, as evidenced by the formation of autophagosomes, upregulated LC3‑II expression and increased LC3 puncta. Cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy had a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells, as evidenced by the induction of cell death and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, which was independent of the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, transfection with Beclin1 small interfering RNA and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3‑methyladenine protected cells from cabazitaxel‑induced cell death, thus confirming that cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy contributed to A549 cell death. In addition, cabazitaxel targeted the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to induce autophagy, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that cabazitaxel exerts a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells by acting on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote autophagic cell death.

Methods:   Clinical outcomes were obtained from the PREVAIL and COU-AA-302 trials. Three outcomes were evaluated: radiographic progression-free survival, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy initiation, and overall survival at 1 year. NNT was calculated as the reciprocal of the outcome event rate difference for ENZA compared with AA. The incremental costs to achieve one additional outcome at 1 year were calculated as the difference in cost per treated patient multiplied by the NNT.

Results:   Within a 1-year time horizon, the total cost per treated patient for ENZA was $2,666 less than AA. Compared with AA, treating 14 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient free of progression or death over 1 year; treating 26 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient with chemotherapy delayed over 1 year; and treating 91 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient free of death over 1 year. Therefore, ENZA is cost-effective compared with AA for all three outcomes evaluated, and the modeled results suggest ENZA is associated with potentially improved clinical outcomes in delaying chemotherapy initiation and disease progression for chemotherapy-naïve patients. The results are robust in sensitivity analyses, where the effect of changes in key model inputs and assumptions were tested.  Conclusion:   The results modeled in the present study suggest ENZA is cost-effective compared with AA for treating chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC.""","""['Marjan Massoudi', 'Mark Balk', 'Hongbo Yang', 'Cat N Bui', 'Bhavik J Pandya', 'Jenny Guo', 'Yan Song', 'Eric Q Wu', 'Bruce Brown', 'Arie Barlev', 'Scott Flanders']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Cost per median overall survival month associated with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone Acetate for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of an NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Treatments for Chemotherapy-Naive Patients with Asymptomatic/Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of enzalutamide for patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Genomic Test-Directed Olaparib for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment-Related Healthcare Costs of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in Germany: A Claims Data Study.', 'Budget Impact of Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of long-acting insulin analogues vs intermediate/long-acting human insulin for type 1 diabetes: A population-based cohort followed over 10 years.']"""

It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥ 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥ 65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥ 65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥ 65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care. Such findings highlight the need for solutions to prevent dementia-related costs from jeopardizing the health and financial security of the families of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias.""","""[""Alzheimer's Association""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Alzheimers Dement""","""[""2015 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2014 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", 'Dementia -- Caring, Ethics, Ethnical and Economical Aspects: A Systematic Review Internet.', ""The costs of Alzheimer's disease and the value of effective therapies."", ""Transcranial magnetic stimulation effects on cognitive enhancement in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis."", ""Unveiling the Enigma: Exploring Risk Factors and Mechanisms for Psychotic Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease through Electronic Medical Records with Deep Learning Models."", 'Potential Role of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in the Treatment of Cognitive Decline and Dementia in Diabetes Mellitus.', ""Micheliolide attenuates neuroinflammation to improve cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways."", ""Identification of diagnostic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease by integrated bioinformatic analysis and machine learning strategies.""]"""

Establishment of aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and DNA methylation (DNAme) produce alterations of gene expression that are common in PCa. Genes of the SFRP family are tumor suppressor genes that are frequently silenced by DNA hypermethylation in many cancer types. The SFRP family is composed of 5 members (SFRP1-5) that modulate the WNT pathway, which is aberrantly activated in PCa. The expression of SFRP genes in PCa and their regulation by DNAme has been controversial. Our objective was to determine the gene expression pattern of the SFRP family in prostatic cell lines and fresh frozen tissues from normal prostates (NP), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa), by qRT-PCR, and their DNAme status by MSP and bisulfite sequencing. In prostatic cancer cell lines, the 5 SFRPs showed significantly decreased expression levels compared to a control normal prostatic cell line (p<0.0001). In agreement, SFRP1 and SFRP5 genes showed decreased expression levels in CaP fresh frozen tissues compared to NP (p<0.01), while a similar trend was observed for SFRP2. Conversely, increased levels of SFRP4 expression were found in PCa compared to BPH (p<0.01). Moreover, SFRP2, SFRP3, and SFRP5 showed DNA hypermethylation in PCa cell lines. Interestingly, we observed DNA hypermethylation at the promoter of SFRP1 in the PC3 cell line, but not in LNCaP. However, in the LNCaP cell line we found an aberrant gain of the repressive histone posttranslational modification Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). In conclusion, decreased expression by DNA hypermethylation of SFRP5 is a common feature of PCa, while decreased expression of SFRP1 can be due to DNA hypermethylation, but sometimes an aberrant gain of the histone mark H3K27me3 is observed instead.""","""['Pilar García-Tobilla', 'Susana R Solórzano', 'Iván Salido-Guadarrama', 'Vanessa González-Covarrubias', 'Gustavo Morales-Montor', 'Carlos E Díaz-Otañez', 'Mauricio Rodríguez-Dorantes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Change in gene expression profiles of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) by sodium butyrate in gastric cancers: induction of promoter demethylation and histone modification causing inhibition of Wnt signaling.', 'Hypermethylation and expression regulation of secreted frizzled-related protein genes in colorectal tumor.', 'Methylation analysis of SFRP genes family in cervical adenocarcinoma.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer: biologic and clinical relevance.', 'The role of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer chemoresistance: A narrative review.', 'SFRP1 induces a stem cell phenotype in prostate cancer cells.', 'Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 5 (SFRP5) Serum Levels Are Decreased in Critical Illness and Sepsis and Are Associated with Short-Term Mortality.', 'Effect of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 5 in Mice with Heart Failure.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials & methods:   The final cohort of a multi-institutional study, consisting of 539 patients with PCa treated with conventionally (CONV:1.8-2Gy/fr) or moderately hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HYPO:2.2-2.7Gy/fr) was considered. Urinary toxicity was evaluated through the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) administered before and after radiotherapy. IPSS increases ⩾10 and 15 points at the end of radiotherapy (ΔIPSS⩾10 and ΔIPSS⩾15) were chosen as endpoints. Average DSMs (corrected into 2Gy-equivalent doses) of patients with/without toxicity were compared through a pixel-wise method. This allowed the extraction of selected spatial descriptors discriminating between patients with/without toxicity. Previously logistic models based on dose-surface histograms (DSH) were considered and replaced with DSM descriptors. Discrimination power, calibration and log-likelihood were considered to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of spatial descriptors.  Results:   Data of 375/539 patients were available. ΔIPSS⩾10 was recorded in 76/375 (20%) patients, while 30/375 (8%) experienced ΔIPSS⩾15. The posterior dose at 12mm from the bladder base (roughly corresponding to the trigone region) resulted significantly associated to toxicity in the whole/HYPO populations. The cranial extension of the 75Gy isodose along the bladder central axis was the best DSM-based predictor in CONV patients. Multi-variable models including DSM descriptors showed better discrimination (AUC=0.66-0.77) when compared to DSH-based models (AUC=0.58-0.71) and higher log-likelihoods.

In the light of the steadily improving prognosis for patients with RMS through interdisciplinary-multimodal study protocols with 60-70% long-term survivors, non oncological aspects such as erectile function (EF) have become increasingly important. The aim of this study was to evaluate EF in patients having undergone treatment for RMS of the bladder and prostate.  Design:   The medical records of 24 male patients having undergone surgical treatment for pelvic RMS between 1975 and 2014 were reviewed, and follow-up was obtained. Erectile function was determined using the Self-Estimation Index of Erectile Function-No Sexual Intercourse (SIEF-NS) and the Erection Hardness Scale (EHS). Potential prognostic factors were evaluated in respect to their impact on EF.  Results:   Thirteen patients were included in the study (median age 20 years). Median follow-up period was 12.7 years (1.09-39.85). All patients completed the EHS; nine patients completed the SIEF-NS. All three patients with preserved erectile function (EHS = 4) showed a score indicating no or minimal impairment on sexual function on SIEF-NS (median 33). None of these patients had undergone external radiotherapy, and radical cystoprostatectomy had been performed before the third year of life in two out of three. The remaining patients had erectile dysfunction (EHS = 0). Three patients had an unsatisfying treatment attempt with sildenafil. Seven patients, including all with failures of oral PDE-5-inhibitors, were successfully treated with intracavernous injection of Alprostadil (Summary Table).  Discussion:   This was the largest study, to date, evaluating erectile EF in patients treated for RMS of the bladder or prostate. EF was preserved in some patients, despite aggressive treatment modalities. Patients affected by erectile dysfunction after therapy showed limited response to PDE-5 inhibitors, but even after failure of the latter, an intracavernous injection of Alprostadil showed a significant improvement in EHS and SIEF-NS. Limitations of the study included the retrospective nature, small sample size, and heterogeneity of underlying disease, stage, and treatment modalities used.  Conclusions:   The results suggested that in a subset of patients, EF was preserved after radical surgical treatment of RMS, especially in young boys. Intracavernous injection of Alprostadil was effective, even after failure of PDE-5-inhibitors, and should be offered to patients without spontaneous erections, whereas PDE-5-inhibitors appeared to be largely ineffective.

The efficacy of apigenin on cell survival, apoptosis, migration and stemness properties were analyzed in CSCs.  Main methods:   Prostate CSCs (CD44(+)) were isolated from human prostate cancer (PCa) PC3 cells using a magnetic-activated cell sorting system. PC3 and CSCs were treated with various concentrations of apigenin, docetaxel and their combinations for 48h.  Key findings:   Apigenin dose dependently inhibited CSCs and PC3 cell survival, and this was accompanied with a significant increase of p21 and p27. Apigenin induced apoptosis via an extrinsic caspase-dependent pathway by upregulating the mRNA expressions of caspases-8, -3 and TNF-α, but failed to regulate the intrinsic pathway as determined by the Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and APAF-1 in CSCs. In contrary to CSCs, apigenin induced intrinsic apoptosis pathway as evidenced by the induction of Bax, Cyt-c and caspase-3 while caspase-8, TNF-α and Bcl-2 levels remained unchanged in PC3 cells. The flavonoid strongly suppressed the migration rate of CSCs compared to untreated cells. Significant downregulation of matrix metallopeptidases-2, -9, Snail and Slug exhibits the ability of apigenin treatment to suppress invasion. The expressions of NF-κB p105/p50, PI3K, Akt and the phosphorylation of pAkt were decreased after apigenin treatment. Moreover, apigenin treatment significantly reduced pluripotency marker Oct3/4 protein expression which might be associated with the down-regulation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling.

In castrate-resistant disease, AR-V7 variants were shown to be predictive factors for resistance to next-generation AR axis-targeting agents and DNA repair targeting emerged as a promising new strategy. In poor-prognosis advanced non-seminoma, a better outcome was randomly demonstrated for the first time when a switch-intensified treatment was used in patients with a slow tumour marker decline. In metastatic kidney cancer, both cabozantinib and checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab) are now associated with improved outcomes in pretreated patients and should soon change the standard of care for these patients. Last but not least, in urothelial bladder cancer, molecular classification is evolving and suggesting that immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is active, as demonstrated in early trials.""","""['Karim Fizazi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Genitourinary cancer.', 'Immunotherapy in uropathology.', 'Role of multidrug resistance in tumors of the genitourinary tract.', 'A review of therapeutic strategies for phase I-II trials in genitourinary cancer.', 'Chemotherapy of urologic metastases.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

The LPN formulation with the highest transfection efficiency (64%) and stability was selected for the study. Mice bearing tumors of PC-3Mcells were treated with LPNs labeled with IR780 or AF647-siRNA. Near infrared imaging showed that LPNs achieved favorable in vivo biodistribution with high tumor/low organ ratios. LPN accumulation was also observed in liver metastatic tissue. Result of extravasation study confirmed that encapsulated siRNA molecules were able to escape into the tumor tissue at the extravascular area. When LPN levels in large (volume>750mm3) and small (<500mm3) tumors were compared, no significant difference was observed. However, both docetaxel pretreatment (72hbefore LPN) and concurrent docetaxel treatment significantly enhanced the tumor LPN levels by 3.9- and 3.1-fold, respectively (both p<0.01).

CIN has been linked to carcinogenesis, metastasis, poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapy. We previously reported that the DAB2IP is a tumor suppressor, and that loss of DAB2IP is often detected in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and is indicative of poor prognosis. Here, we report that the loss of DAB2IP results in impaired KT-MT attachment, compromised SAC and aberrant chromosomal segregation. We discovered that DAB2IP directly interacts with Plk1 and its loss inhibits Plk1 kinase activity, thereby impairing Plk1-mediated BubR1 phosphorylation. Loss of DAB2IP decreases the localization of BubR1 at the kinetochore during mitosis progression. In addition, the reconstitution of DAB2IP enhances the sensitivity of PCa cells to microtubule stabilizing drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel) and Plk1 inhibitor (BI2536).

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of prostate cancer patients who underwent geriatric assessment during the therapeutic management from 2008 to 2014. Patient, tumor, treatment characteristics and their associated toxicity as well as the parameters of geriatric assessment were studied. The occurrence of geriatric assessment within the 3 months preceding a therapeutic decision was reviewed.  Results:   Data of seventy-four patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 15.6 years. The average age at diagnosis was 74.3 and 80.6 at the geriatric assessment. At the time of the geriatric assessment 64 patients had metastatic disease, 39 were in poor condition more than 50% of patients had walking ability disorders. Thirteen patients underwent radical surgery, 28 received radiotherapy, 30 patients had chemotherapy and hormonotherapy was prescribed for 72 patients. The geriatric assessment, requested on average 15 years after diagnosis, was not carried out within the 3 months preceding treatment decision for 55 patients.  Conclusion:   The recourse to geriatric assessment is predominantly used to endorse a decision of supportive care for elderly patients with prostate cancer. An early intervention by a geriatrician consultant for the initial management and then at each therapeutic event is a sine qua non condition for efficient personalized therapeutic management suitable to every patient according to physiological age.

Epigenetic modifications of histones contribute to chromatin structure and result in the alterations in gene expression. Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with the promoters of actively transcribed genes and can serve as a transcriptional on/off switch. RbBP5 is a component of the COMPASS/ -like complex, which catalyzes H3K4me3 formation. In this study, we found that in the process of TGF-Beta1 induced EMT in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, H3K4me3 enrichment and RbBP5 binding increased in the vicinity of Snail (SNAI1) transcription start site. Knocking-down of RbBP5 notably decreased Snail expression and EMT. Recruitment of RbBP5 and formation of H3K4me3 at Snail TSS during EMT depend on binding of SMAD2/3 and CBP at Snail TSS. This study links the SMAD2/3 signal with Snail transcription via a histone modification - H3K4me3. Furthermore, our research also demonstrates that RbBP5 and even WRAD may be a promising therapeutic candidates in treating prostate cancer metastasis, and that DU145 cells maintain their incomplete mesenchymal state in an auto/ paracrine manner.""","""['Dong Li', 'Hui Sun', 'Wen-Jing Sun', 'Hong-Bo Bao', 'Shu-Han Si', 'Jia-Lin Fan', 'Ping Lin', 'Rong-Jun Cui', 'Yu-Jia Pan', 'Si-Min Wen', 'Xiu-Lan Zheng', 'Xiao-Guang Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Keratin 13 gene is epigenetically suppressed during transforming growth factor-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a human keratinocyte cell line.', 'Smad3-mediated recruitment of the methyltransferase SETDB1/ESET controls Snail1 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'EGF induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition through phospho-Smad2/3-Snail signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition: focusing on hypoxia and TGF-β signaling.', 'Epigenetic Regulation and Post-Translational Modifications of SNAI1 in Cancer Metastasis.', 'LPCAT1 enhances the invasion and migration in gastric cancer: Based on computational biology methods and in vitro experiments.', 'FOXQ1 recruits the MLL complex to activate transcription of EMT and promote breast cancer metastasis.', 'TGF-β in developmental and fibrogenic EMTs.', 'Up-regulation of microRNA-34a mediates ethanol-induced impairment of neural crest cell migration in vitro and in zebrafish embryos through modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting Snail1.', 'Crosstalk Between Inflammatory Signaling and Methylation in Cancer.']"""

However, image quality may suffer from long acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, which also leads to patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition times can reduce patient discomfort leading to reduced motion artifacts from the acquisition process. Compressive sensing strategies applied to MRI have been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing acquisition times significantly by sparsely sampling the k-space during the acquisition process. However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction algorithms to produce high quality and reliable images from compressive sensing MRI.  Methods:   This paper proposes a new reconstruction approach based on cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces constraints in both k-space and spatial domains within a stochastically fully connected graphical model to produce improved MRI reconstruction.  Results:   Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate show strong performance in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the reconstructed images when compared to other tested methods even at low sampling rates.  Conclusions:   The ability to better utilize a limited amount of information to reconstruct T2w and DWI images in a short amount of time while preserving the important details in the images demonstrates the potential of the proposed CD-SFCRF framework as a viable reconstruction algorithm for compressive sensing MRI.""","""['Edward Li', 'Farzad Khalvati', 'Mohammad Javad Shafiee', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Alexander Wong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""BMC Med Imaging""","""['Prior data assisted compressed sensing: a novel MR imaging strategy for real time tracking of lung tumors.', 'Visually weighted reconstruction of compressive sensing MRI.', 'Local sparsity enhanced compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging in uniform discrete curvelet domain.', 'An Algorithm Combining Analysis-based Blind Compressed Sensing and Nonlocal Low-rank Constraints for MRI Reconstruction.', 'Application of Compressive Sensing to Ultrasound Images: A Review.', 'Joint sparse reconstruction of multi-contrast MRI images with graph based redundant wavelet transform.']"""

Methods:   The 50 largest cities in the US were the units of analysis. Data from two 5-year periods were analyzed: 1990-1994 and 2005-2009. Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasm of prostate (prostate cancer) (ICD9=185 and ICD10=C61). Population-based denominators were obtained from US Census data. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic Black: non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs), rate differences (RDs), and corresponding confidence intervals for each 5-year period. We also calculated correlation and unadjusted regression coefficients for 11 city-level variables, such as segregation and median income, and the RDs.  Results:   At the final time point (2005-2009), the US and all 41 cities included in the analyses had a RR greater than 1 (indicating that the Black rate was higher than the White rate) (range=1.13 in Minneapolis to 3.24 in Los Angeles), 37 of them statistically significantly so. The US and 26 of the 41 cities saw an increase in the Black:White RR between the time points. The level of disparity within a city was associated with the degree of Black segregation.  Conclusion:   This analysis revealed large disparities in Black:White prostate cancer mortality in the US and many of its largest cities over the past two decades. The data show considerable variation in the degree of disparity across cities, even among cities within the same state. This type of specific city-level data can be used to motivate public health professionals, government officials, cancer control agencies, and community-based organizations in cities with large or increasing disparities to demand more resources, focus research efforts, and implement effective policy and programmatic changes in order to combat this highly prevalent condition.""","""['Maureen R Benjamins', 'Bijou R Hunt', 'Sarah M Raleigh', 'Jana L Hirschtick', 'Michelle M Hughes']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Black:White disparities in lung cancer mortality in the 50 largest cities in the United States.', 'Black:white disparities in breast cancer mortality in the 50 largest cities in the United States, 2005-2014.', 'Increasing Black:White disparities in breast cancer mortality in the 50 largest cities in the United States.', 'Age-related racial disparities in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Prostate cancer in black and white Americans.', 'Racial disparities in inpatient clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes in brain metastasis.', 'Prostate cancer upgrading and adverse pathology in Hispanic men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.', 'Trends in mortality among Black and White men with prostate cancer in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania: Race and neighborhood socioeconomic position.', 'Identifying Risk Profiles of Malignant Prostate Cancer Surgical Delay Using a Person-Centered Approach to Understand Prostate Cancer Disparities: The Constellation of Health Determinants Using Latent Class Analysis on Cancer Registry Data.']"""

We observed rapid adaptation to hypoxia, with drug resistance to 2 μM staurosporine established within 30 min of hypoxia. Annexin-V/Sytox Green apoptosis assays over 9 h showed 78.0% viability, compared to 84.5% viability in control cells (normoxic cells with no staurosporine). Normoxic cells exposed to the same staurosporine concentration had a viability of 48.6% after 9 h. Hypoxia adaptation was rapid and reversible, with Hypoxic cells treated with 20% oxygen for 30 min responding to staurosporine with 51.6% viability after drug treatment for 9 h. Induction of apoptosis through the receptor-mediated pathway, which bypasses anti-apoptosis mechanisms induced by hypoxia, resulted in 39.4 ± 7% cell viability.

Methods:   This study was based on the 2001-2002 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A subsample of 1,127 men aged 40-85 years without prior history of prostate cancer who provided informed consent and blood samples were selected. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) relative to standard DNA reference (T/S ratio) was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Survey-weighted multivariable linear regression was performed to examine T/S ratio across quintiles of total and free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio (%fPSA). A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding men dying from prostate cancer during follow-up through to December 31, 2006. Stratification analyses were carried out to assess any effect modification by age group, race, body mass index (BMI), and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation.  Results:   Higher total PSA levels were associated to longer LTL, with approximately 8% increase in log-transformed T/S ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2-13%) among men in the highest quintile of total PSA compared to the lowest in the fully adjusted model (Ptrend = 0.01). No significant association was found for free PSA or %fPSA, although nonlinearity between all PSA measures and T/S ratio was indicated. Similar results were found after excluding men who died from prostate cancer during follow-up. We also found the associations between total PSA and T/S ratio to be strongest among non-Hispanic blacks, non-obese men (BMI <30 kg/m2 ), and those with low CRP. However, a significant interaction was only found between total PSA and race/ethnicity (Pinteraction = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Total PSA levels were strongly associated to LTL, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks.

Here we assembled and analyzed a large RNA-seq dataset, from 585 patient samples, including benign prostate tissue and both localized and metastatic PCa to discover and validate differentially expressed genes associated with disease aggressiveness. We performed Sample Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA) and identified genes associated with low versus high Gleason score in the RNA-seq database. Comparing Gleason 6 versus 9+ PCa samples, we identified 99 differentially expressed genes with variable association to Gleason grade as well as robust expression in prostate cancer. The top-ranked novel lncRNA PCAT14, exhibits both cancer and lineage specificity. On multivariate analysis, low PCAT14 expression independently predicts for BPFS (P=.00126), PSS (P=.0385), and MFS (P=.000609), with trends for OS as well (P=.056). An RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) assay for PCAT14 distinguished benign vs malignant cases, as well as high vs low Gleason disease. PCAT14 is transcriptionally regulated by AR, and endogenous PCAT14 overexpression suppresses cell invasion.

The long-term adverse and beneficial consequences of finasteride have not been examined.  Methods:   We used a linkage between data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and Medicare claims. Patients were examined by randomized study arm (finasteride vs placebo for 7 years) for long-term consequences of the intervention, including cardiac, endocrine, and sexual dysfunction, depression, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related events. To examine time to events, we used cumulative incidence and Cox regression, adjusting for covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   A total of 13 935 of 18 880 participants (73.8%) in the PCPT were linked to Medicare claims, with median Medicare follow-up assessment time of 16 years from trial registration. There were no differences between finasteride and placebo participants with respect to important baseline factors or amount of Medicare follow-up assessment time. Finasteride patients had a 10% higher risk of new claims for depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.19, P = .04) and a 6% lower risk of procedures for BPH-related events (primarily lower urinary tract symptoms; HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.00, P = .03). No other differences were found in rates of long-term consequences of intervention in the two study arms.  Conclusions:   Finasteride use is associated with reduced need for procedures for relief of BPH-related events and a modest increase in depression. Overall, there is little need to worry about long-term noncancer consequences of finasteride use in those who use it for treatment of symptomatic BPH, hair growth, or prevention of cancer.""","""['Joseph M Unger', 'Cathee Till', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Phyllis J Goodman', 'Jason D Wright', 'William E Barlow', 'Scott D Ramsey', 'Lori M Minasian', 'Dawn L Hershman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Re: Long-Term Consequences of Finasteride vs Placebo in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Using Medicare Claims to Examine Long-term Prostate Cancer Risk of Finasteride in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'The effects of dutasteride and finasteride on BPH-related hospitalization, surgery and prostate cancer diagnosis: a record-linkage analysis.', 'Clinical effects and economical impact of dutasteride and finasteride therapy in Italian men with LUTS.', 'The clinical applications of five-alpha reductase inhibitors.', 'Five-alpha-reductase Inhibitors for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Beliefs and counseling practices among dermatologists regarding sexual and other adverse effects of finasteride.', 'Suicidal risk associated with finasteride versus dutasteride among men treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia: nationwide cohort study.', 'Association of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors With Dementia, Depression, and Suicide.', 'Pharmacological and interventional treatment of benign prostatic obstruction: An evidence-based comparative review.', '5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors and Prostate Cancer Mortality among Men with Regular Access to Screening and Health Care.']"""

Sunitinib is attractive as a maintenance therapy due to its mechanism of action, oral route of administration, and acceptable toxicity profile. We designed a phase II study of sunitinib in patients with mCRPC who responded to docetaxel. Methods Patients with responding or stable disease at the completion of docetaxel treatment received 50 mg of sunitinib on 4 week on 2 week off cycles. Treatment continued until disease progression (either by RECIST 1.1 criteria or by cancer related symptomatic progression), intolerable toxicity, start of new cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included PSA response rate and safety. Results Twenty-three patients were enrolled and treated. The mean number of prior cycles of docetaxel given was 8.6 (range 4-12). The median number of cycles of sunitinib administered was 4 (range 1-11). Adverse events were generally grade 1-2 with 12 % grade ≥ 3 which were of a type and severity expected for sunitinib. Median PFS was 4.4 months (95 % CI: 1.6-5.1). Most patients had immediate PSA increases without other evidence of disease progression, with the mean increases in PSA over baseline being 197 %, 342 %, and 1437 % in Cycles 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusion Sunitinib was tolerable as maintenance therapy but median PFS was significantly lower than the predefined threshold of 6 months.""","""['Sunil Parimi', 'Misha Eliasziw', 'Scott North', 'Marc Trudeau', 'Eric Winquist', 'Kim N Chi', 'Dean Ruether', 'Tina Cheng', 'Bernhard J Eigl']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Radiographic progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 criteria as an intermediate endpoint for drug development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Sunitinib malate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Phase 2 Trial of Abiraterone Followed by Randomization to Addition of Dasatinib or Sunitinib in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Analyzing data from 3,610 cancer survivors and 59,539 individuals without cancer in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined the relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL, taking remission status into account and controlling for patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities. HRQOL measurements included the six-dimensional health state short form (derived from 36-item short form health survey) (SF-6D) utility scores, the physical component summary score, and the mental component summary score.  Results:   The relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL varied substantially across cancer types. Compared with individuals without cancer, survivors of breast, prostate, or poor-prognosis cancer had statistically lower SF-6D scores within 2 years of diagnosis (-0.044, -0.062, and -0.088, respectively). Breast cancer survivors had SF-6D scores similar to those of individuals without cancer after 2 years, as did patients with poor-prognosis cancer after 5 years. Nevertheless, even after a period of 10 years, survivors of prostate or cervical cancer had a lower level of SF-6D scores (-0.027 and -0.042, respectively). The comparisons of physical health between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer were similar to those of SF-6D. In contrast, most cancer survivors did not experience poorer mental health; survivors of prostate or cervical cancer, however, had lower mental component summary scores after 10 years of diagnosis.  Conclusions:   The level of HRQOL among cancer survivors depends on time since cancer diagnosis and cancer type. Some cancer survivors have lower HRQOL after a decade of diagnosis, even in remission.""","""['Shi-Yi Wang', 'Sylvia H Hsu', 'Cary P Gross', 'Tara Sanft', 'Amy J Davidoff', 'Xiaomei Ma', 'James B Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life and Health-Related Quality of Life in Young Adult Thyroid Cancer Survivors.', 'Health-related quality of life in older adult survivors of selected cancers: data from the SEER-MHOS linkage.', 'Health-Related Quality of Life of Community Thyroid Cancer Survivors in Hangzhou, China.', 'Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients assessed by 36-item short form health survey (SF-36): a meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of health-related quality of life in pediatric CNS tumor survivors.', 'Mental health at different stages of cancer survival: a natural language processing study of Reddit posts.', 'Critical Appraisal of Decision Models Used for the Economic Evaluation of Bladder Cancer Screening and Diagnosis: A Systematic Review.', 'Illness perceptions, fear of progression and health-related quality of life during acute treatment and follow-up care in paediatric cancer patients and their parents: a cross-sectional study.', 'A Systematic Literature Review of Health Utility Values in Breast Cancer.', 'Two-year quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy according to pentafecta criteria and cancer of the prostate risk assessment (CAPRA-S).']"""

Although MDx are used to screen patients and inform disease management and treatment decisions, there is no uniform approach to their evaluation by HTA organizations.  Objectives:   The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group reviewed diagnostic-specific HTA programs and identified elements representing common and best practices.  Methods:   MDx-specific HTA programs in Europe, Australia, and North America were characterized by methodology, evaluation framework, and impact. Published MDx HTAs were reviewed, and five representative case studies of test evaluations were developed: United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Diagnostics Assessment Programme, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase mutation), United States (Palmetto's Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, OncotypeDx prostate cancer test), Germany (Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare, human papillomavirus testing), Australia (Medical Services Advisory Committee, anaplastic lymphoma kinase testing for non-small cell lung cancer), and Canada (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Rapid Response: Non-invasive Prenatal Testing).  Results:   Overall, the few HTA programs that have MDx-specific methods do not provide clear parameters of acceptability related to clinical and analytic performance, clinical utility, and economic impact. The case studies highlight similarities and differences in evaluation approaches across HTAs in the performance metrics used (analytic and clinical validity, clinical utility), evidence requirements, and how value is measured. Not all HTAs are directly linked to reimbursement outcomes.  Conclusions:   To improve MDx HTAs, organizations should provide greater transparency, better communication and collaboration between industry and HTA stakeholders, clearer links between HTA and funding decisions, explicit recognition of and rationale for differential approaches to laboratory-developed versus regulatory-approved test, and clear evidence requirements.""","""['Susan Garfield', 'Julie Polisena', 'Daryl S Spinner', 'Anne Postulka', 'Christine Y Lu', 'Simrandeep K Tiwana', 'Eric Faulkner', 'Nick Poulios', 'Vladimir Zah', 'Michael Longacre']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Health technology assessment of medical devices: What is different?
