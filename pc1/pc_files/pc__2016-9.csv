In this manner, we identified MNX1 as a novel oncogene upregulated to a relatively greater degree in prostate cancer from AA men. Androgen and AKT signaling play a central role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and we found that both of these signaling pathways increased MNX1 expression. MNX1 in turn upregulated lipid synthesis by stimulating expression of SREBP1 and fatty acid synthetase.

Material and methods:   The patient-reported QOL was evaluated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26). According to the progression in QOL score over 12months, patients were assigned to one of three subgroups: score decrement, no change, or increment. The dosimetric parameters were cross-compared among subgroups in urinary and bowel domains using univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The evaluated dosimetric metrics included target volume, V100 (volume receiving 100% prescription dose); rectal volume/dose-volume endpoints, maximum/mean doses; bladder volume/dose-volume endpoints, and maximum/mean doses.  Results:   Patients with consistent QOL reduction in urinary irritation function were significantly associated with greater mean bladder dose, greater V85/V90/V95/V100 and D2cc/D10cc. Patients with QOL reduction in urinary incontinence were marginally associated with greater mean bladder dose (p=0.06). None of the evaluated dosimetric parameters showed a significant correlation with QOL score change in bowel function.  Conclusions:   Patients with large prostate size were more susceptible to QOL decrements for urinary irritative and incontinency functions.

Material and methods:   844 CBCT images from 20 patients undergoing radical prostate radiotherapy were included. Patients received a dose of 74Gy in 37 fractions using 7-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

A daily online CBCT verification schedule was compared with a protocol of verification on days 1-3 followed by weekly online imaging. PTV margins of 3mm, 5mm, and 7mm were compared for the daily imaging protocol.  Results:   90% of patients had improved target coverage with daily online in comparison to weekly online imaging. A median of 37 fractions per treatment course achieved CTV coverage with daily imaging compared to 34 fractions with a weekly online protocol. 80% of patients had a reduction in rectal dose with the daily protocol.

In this study, a novel combinatorial phage biopanning procedure was developed to discover PSMA-specific peptides that can be potentially used as ligands for targeted drug delivery to prostate cancer cells. Five rounds of biopanning against recombinant human PSMA extracellular domain (ECD), PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, and LNCaP xenografts in nude mice were conducted. Various affinity assays were conducted to identify high-affinity peptides for PSMA ECD and PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells. Among them, the GTI peptide shows the highest affinity as well as specificity to PSMA in prostate cancer cells. The apparent Kd values of the GTI peptide to PSMA-positive LNCaP and C4-2 cells are 8.22Î¼M and 8.91Î¼M, respectively. The GTI peptide can specifically deliver the proapoptotic peptide D(KLAKLAK)2 to LNCaP cells to induce cell death. In the biodistribution study, the GTI peptide shows the highest uptake in C4-2 xenografts, while its uptake in other major organs, such as the liver and spleen, are either low or negligible. Compared to its scrambled control (random permutation of the GTI peptide), the GTI peptide exhibits higher and more specific uptake in C4-2 xenografts. All the results suggest that the GTI peptide is a potentially promising ligand for PSMA-targeted drug delivery for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Wei Jin', 'Bin Qin', 'Zhijin Chen', 'Hao Liu', 'Ashutosh Barve', 'Kun Cheng']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Synthesis and Initial Biological Evaluation of Boron-Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands for Treatment of Prostate Cancer Using Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA-Paclitaxel Conjugate.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Bispecific radioligands targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors on the surface of prostate cancer cells.', 'Multivalent effect of peptide functionalized polymeric nanoparticles towards selective prostate cancer targeting.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'The establishment of polypeptide PSMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-engineered natural killer cells for castration-resistant prostate cancer and the induction of ferroptosis-related cell death.', 'Discovery of Anti-PD-L1 Human Domain Antibodies for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Peptides for Vaccine Development.']"""

We had earlier shown that serum levels of TrxR protein are very low in healthy mice, but can in close correlation to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase more than 200-fold upon chemically induced liver damage. We also found that enzymatic TrxR activity in serum is counteracted by a yet unidentified oxidase activity in serum. In the present study we found that mice carrying H22 hepatocellular carcinoma tumors present highly increased levels of TrxR in serum, similarly to that reported in human patients. In this case ALT levels did not parallel those of TrxR. We also discovered here that the TrxR-antagonistic oxidase activity in serum is due to the presence of quiescin Q6 sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1). We furthermore found that the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin or auranofin, when given systemically to H22 tumor bearing mice, can further inhibit TrxR activities in serum. The TrxR serum activity was also inhibited by endogenous electrophilic inhibitors, found to increase in tumor-bearing mice and to include protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Thus, hepatocellular carcinoma triggers high levels of serum TrxR that are not paralleled by ALT, and TrxR enzyme activity in serum is counteracted by several different mechanisms. The physiological role of TrxR in serum, if any, as well as its potential value as a prognostic marker for tumor progression, needs to be studied further.""","""['Le Zhang', 'Qing Cheng', 'Longjie Zhang', 'Yijun Wang', 'Gary F Merrill', 'Tal Ilani', 'Deborah Fass', 'Elias S J ArnÃ©r', 'Jinsong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Correlation of plasma thioredoxin reductase activity to growth of H22 hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in Kunming mice.', 'Auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells by generation of reactive oxygen species.', 'Inhibitory effects of thioredoxin reductase antisense RNA on the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Potential Anticancer Activity of Auranofin.', 'Potential Anticancer Activity of Auranofin.', 'Evaluation of dithiothreitol-oxidizing capacity (DOC) as a serum biomarker for chronic hepatitis B in patients exhibiting normal alanine aminotransferase levels: a pilot study towards better monitoring of disease.', 'Protoporphyrin IX is a dual inhibitor of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions and induces apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.', 'NADPH-dependent and -independent disulfide reductase systems.', 'Butaselen prevents hepatocarcinogenesis and progression through inhibiting thioredoxin reductase activity.']"""

Adhesion of prostate cancer cells to fibronectin via the integrin Î±5 (ITGA5) has been proposed as a candidate bone marrow niche localization mechanism. We hypothesized that the mechanisms whereby ITGA5 regulates the adhesion-mediated survival of prostate cancer cells will define novel therapeutic approaches. ITGA5 shRNA reduced expression of BCL-2 family members and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In these PTEN-mutant cells, pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway in combination with ITGA5 knockdown enhanced apoptosis. Chemical parsing studies with BH3 mimetics indicated that PI3K/Akt inhibition in combination with BCL-XL-specific inhibition induces synergistic apoptosis specifically in PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells, whereas single-agent PI3K/Akt inhibitors did not. Given the importance of PTEN loss in the progression of prostate and other cancers, synthetic lethality induced by combinatorial PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic strategy.  Implications:   Activation of the PI3K pathway through PTEN loss represents a major molecular pathway in the progression of prostate and other cancers. This study defines a synthetic lethal therapeutic combination with significant translational potential.  Overview:   Synthetic lethality in PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells with combined PI3K/Akt and BCL-XL inhibition. PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cells expressing ITGA5 bind to fibronectin in the putative bone marrow niche and transduce survival signals to BCL-XL Additional PTEN-regulated signals independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway likely feed into the BCL-XL-regulated survival program to explain synthetic lethality observed with the combination.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2016/12/02/1541-7786.MCR-16-0202/F1.large.jpg.

Our objective was to identify and describe (1) physician knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the use of imaging to stage prostate cancer, (2) patient attitudes and behaviors related to use of imaging, and (3) to compare responses across three VA medical centers (VAMCs).  Methods:   A qualitative approach was used to explore patient and provider knowledge and behaviors relating to the use of imaging. We conducted 39 semi-structured interviews total-including 22 interviews with patients with newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 17 interviews with physicians caring for them-between September 2014 and July 2015 at three VAMCs representing a spectrum of inappropriate imaging rates. After core theoretical concepts were identified, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was selected to explore linkages between themes within the dataset and existing domains within the framework. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded and analyzed using Nvivo software.  Results:   Themes from patient interviews were categorized within four TDF domains. Patients reported little interest in staging as compared to disease treatment (goals), and many could not remember if they had imaging at all (knowledge). Patients tended to trust their doctor to make decisions about appropriate tests (beliefs about capabilities). Some patients expressed a minor concern for radiation exposure, but anxiety about cancer outcomes outweighed these fears (emotion). Themes from physician interviews were categorized within five TDF domains. Most physicians self-reported that they know and trust imaging guidelines (knowledge) yet some were still likely to follow their own intuition, whether due to clinical suspicion or years of experience (beliefs about capabilities). Additionally, physicians reported that medico-legal concerns, fear of missing associated diagnoses (beliefs about consequences), influence from colleagues who image frequently (social influences), and the facility where they practice influences rates of imaging (environmental context).  Conclusions:   Interviews with patients and physicians suggest that physicians are the primary (and in some cases only) decision-makers regarding staging imaging for prostate cancer.

This study aims to describe patterns-of- presentation and -care for men diagnosed with PCa in a specific regional Victorian area, and compare the outcomes with other Victorian regions.  Methods:   Information on consecutive men diagnosed between 2008 and 2013 was extracted from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria. Descriptive analyses summarized diagnostic and treatment patterns of the 7,204 men with PCa in the selected region (n = 373), metropolitan Melbourne (n = 2,565) and remaining areas of Victoria (n = 4,266) to compare risk factors, treatments and time-taken-to-treatment.  Results:   Men with PCa in the selected region were more likely to be diagnosed at older age (aged 68.6 vs 66 years in the rest of Victoria), and incidentally rather than through case-finding PSA blood tests. They were more likely to be presented with higher NCCN risk of the disease (High: 26 %, 24 % and 20.3 %; Very high/Metastasis: 11.8 %, 5.2 % and 5.7 % in the study region, metropolitan Melbourne and elsewhere in Victoria, respectively). Men in the selected region were also more likely to have a longer time from diagnosis to treatment (on average 15-30 days longer when compared to the rest of Victoria).  Conclusions:   Poorer outcomes of men with PCa in this specific region might be explained by multiple factors, including clinical-, patient-, and health-system-related. This range of explanatory factors, occurring at multiple points along the pathway of diagnosis and detection, suggests that interventions to improve outcomes for PCa in regional areas such as this need to be systematic.

Bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrates the MIEN1 promoter contains a short interspersed nuclear Alu element (SINE Alu) repeat sequence. Validation of methylation inhibition on MIEN1 was performed using nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors and resulted in an increase in both MIEN1 RNA and protein in normal cells. MIEN1 mRNA and protein increases upon inhibition of individual DNA methyltransferases using RNA interference technologies. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays, in silico analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a sequence upstream of the transcription start site that has a site for binding of the USF transcription factors.

The proposed signal amplification strategy is an integrated ""biological circuit"" designed to initiate a cascade of enzymatic reactions in order to detect, amplify, and measure a specific miRNA sequence by using the isothermal cleavage property of a DSN. The circuit is composed of two molecular switches operating in series: the amplification reaction activated by a specific miRNA and the strand-displacement polymerization reaction designed to initiate molecular beacon-assisted amplification and signal transduction by using MG/G-quadruplex complex. The hsa-miR-141 (miR141) was chosen as a target miRNA because its level specifically abnormal in a wide range of common human cancers including breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancer. The proposed method allowed quantitative sequence-specific detection of miR141 (with a detection limit of 1.03pM) in a dynamic range from 1pM to 10Î¼M, with an excellent ability to discriminate differences in miRNAs. Moreover, the detection assay was applied to quantify miR141 in cancerous cell lysates.

Bone marrow adipocytes are metabolically active cells capable of shaping tumor metabolism via lipolysis and lipid transfer. In this study, using in vitro and in vivo models of marrow adiposity, we demonstrate that marrow fat cells promote Warburg phenotype in metastatic prostate cancer cells. We show increased expression of glycolytic enzymes, increased lactate production, and decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells exposed to adipocytes that require paracrine signaling between the two cell types. We also reveal that prostate cancer cells are capable of inducing adipocyte lipolysis as a postulated mechanism of sustenance. We provide evidence that adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells via oxygen-independent mechanism of HIF-1Î± activation that can be reversed by HIF-1Î± downregulation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the observed metabolic signature in tumor cells exposed to adipocytes mimics the expression patterns seen in patients with metastatic disease.

In this study, we observed that ST6Gal-I expression was upregulated in human PCa tissues compared to non-malignant prostate tissues. High ST6Gal-I expression was positively correlated with Gleason scores, seminal vesicle involvement and poor survival in patients with PCa. ST6Gal-I knockdown in aggressive prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells significantly inhibited the proliferation, growth, migration and invasion capabilities of these cells. ST6Gal-I knockdown decreased the levels of several PI3K/Akt/GSK-3Î²/ Î²-catenin pathway components, such as p-PI3K, (Ser473)p-Akt, (Ser9)p-GSK-3Î² and Î²-catenin.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that NKAIN2 truncation is specific to Chinese while deletion of the gene is frequent in both Chinese and UK prostate cancers. Significantly reduced expression of NKAIN2 was also detected at both RNA and protein levels. Somatic mutations of NKAIN2 in prostate cancer samples exist but at very low frequency, suggesting that it is a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG) with haploid insufficiency. Our functional studies showed that overexpression of NKAIN2 in prostate cancer cells inhibits cellular growth by promoting cell apoptosis, and decreasing cell migration and invasion. Conversely, knockdown of NKAIN2 promotes prostate cancer cell growth by inhibiting cell apoptosis, and increasing cell migration and invasion. These data imply that NKAIN2 is a novel TSG whose activity is commonly reduced in prostate cancer.

Factor analysis has the potential to identify an optimal number of latent factors (i.e., symptom groups). However, the ultimate goal of treatment response modeling is to understand the relationship between treatment variables such as radiation dose and symptom groups resulting from FA. Hence, it is crucial to identify clinically more relevant symptom groups and improved response variables from those symptom groups for a quantitative analysis.  Objectives:   The goal of this study is to design a computational method for finding clinically relevant symptom groups from PROs and to test associations between symptom groups and radiation dose.  Methods:   We propose a novel approach where exploratory factor analysis is followed by confirmatory factor analysis to determine the relevant number of symptom groups. We also propose to use a combination of symptoms in a symptom group identified as a new response variable in linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the symptom group and dose-volume variables.  Results:   We analyzed patient-reported gastrointestinal symptom profiles from 3 datasets in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. The final structural model of each dataset was validated using the other two datasets and compared to four other existing FA methods. Our systematic EFA-CFA approach provided clinically more relevant solutions than other methods, resulting in new clinically relevant outcome variables that enabled a quantitative analysis. As a result, statistically significant correlations were found between some dose-volume variables to relevant anatomic structures and symptom groups identified by FA.

When a treatment is prescribed depending on the biomarker, confounding by indication might be introduced if the treatment modifies the marker profile and risk of failure. Objective Our aim was to highlight the flexibility of a two-stage model fitted within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. For this purpose, we monitored the prostate-specific antigens in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy. In the presence of rising prostate-specific antigens after external beam radiation therapy, salvage hormone therapy can be prescribed to reduce both the prostate-specific antigens concentration and the risk of clinical failure, an illustration of confounding by indication. We focused on the assessment of the prognostic value of hormone therapy and prostate-specific antigens trajectory on the risk of failure. Methods We used a two-stage model within a Bayesian framework to assess the role of the prostate-specific antigens profile on clinical failure while accounting for a secondary treatment prescribed by indication. We modeled prostate-specific antigens using a hierarchical piecewise linear trajectory with a random changepoint. Residual prostate-specific antigens variability was expressed as a function of prostate-specific antigens concentration. Covariates in the survival model included hormone therapy, baseline characteristics, and individual predictions of the prostate-specific antigens nadir and timing and prostate-specific antigens slopes before and after the nadir as provided by the longitudinal process. Results We showed positive associations between an increased prostate-specific antigens nadir, an earlier changepoint and a steeper post-nadir slope with an increased risk of failure. Importantly, we highlighted a significant benefit of hormone therapy, an effect that was not observed when the prostate-specific antigens trajectory was not accounted for in the survival model.

Radiotherapy can salvage those patients, provided that all disease is encompassed within the target volume. We hypothesized that this can be achieved more adequately with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided treatment planning.  Material and methods:   From January 2009 to April 2014, 183 patients were referred to our department for salvage radiotherapy (SRT). According to protocol, patients received a planning computed tomography (CT) as well as an MRI in treatment position. All MRI scans were retrospectively reviewed by an experienced uro-radiologist.  Results:   Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at time of referral was 0.3 ng/ml (range 0.02-4.7 ng/ml). MRI did not show any suspected macroscopic disease in 137 patients (75%). In 46 (25%) patients, MRI did indicate a pelvic recurrence. The mean PSA level was significantly higher in patients with a suspected recurrence on MRI (0.4 vs. 1.4 ng/ml, p < .001) on a Student's t-test. The mean follow-up was 33 months (range 5-69 months). Biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was significantly worse in patients with suspected disease on MRI [hazard ratio (HR) 2.9, p < .0001]. bDFS was significantly worse in the subgroup where the macroscopic recurrences on MRI received a lower radiation dose (HR 3.4, p = .01).  Conclusion:   MRI detects loco-regional disease in a substantial subset of patients with a biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy, especially in a PSA above 0.5 Î¼g/l. Lack of MRI-based dose escalation on these macroscopic recurrences could explain some of the biochemical progression observed after SRT.""","""['Piet Dirix', 'Lien van Walle', 'Filip Deckers', 'FranÃ§ois Van Mieghem', 'Guido Buelens', 'Paul Meijnders', 'Philippe Huget', 'Steven Van Laere']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic factors after salvage radiotherapy alone in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'PET/CT and MRI directed extended salvage radiotherapy in recurrent prostate cancer with lymph node metastases.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Brachytherapy for the treatment of recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy.', 'Targeting Local Recurrence After Surgery With MRI Imaging for Prostate Cancer in the Setting of Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'A Prospective Study Assessing the Post-Prostatectomy Detection Rate of a Presumed Local Failure at mpMR with Either 64CuCl2 or 64CuPSMA PET/CT.', 'The Role of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance in\xa0Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiation Therapy Planning for Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-guided salvage radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: restaging performance of 18F-choline hybrid PET/MRI.']"""

Blood boric acid (BA) levels reflect recent B intake, and men at the US mean intake have a reported non-fasting level of 10 Î¼M. Treatment of DU-145 prostate cancer cells with physiological concentrations of BA inhibits cell proliferation without causing apoptosis and activates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2Î±). EIF2Î± induces cell differentiation and protects cells by redirecting gene expression to manage endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our objective was to determine the temporal expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-activated genes in DU-145 prostate cells treated with 10 Î¼M BA. Immunoblots showed post-treatment increases in eIF2Î± protein at 30 min and ATF4 and ATF6 proteins at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. The increase in ATF4 was accompanied by an increase in the expression of its downstream genes growth arrest and DNA damage-induced protein 34 (GADD34) and homocysteine-induced ER protein (Herp), but a decrease in GADD153/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), a pro-apoptotic gene. The increase in ATF6 was accompanied by an increase in expression of its downstream genes GRP78/BiP, calreticulin, Grp94, and EDEM. BA did not activate IRE1 or induce cleavage of XBP1 mRNA, a target of IRE1. Low boron status has been associated with increased cancer risk, low bone mineralization, and retinal degeneration. ATF4 and BiP/GRP78 function in osteogenesis and bone remodeling, calreticulin is required for tumor suppressor p53 function and mineralization of teeth, and BiP/GRP78 and EDEM prevent the aggregation of misfolded opsins which leads to retinal degeneration.

Materials and methods:   Thirty-one patients who underwent integrated PET/MRI using 18 F-choline and 18 F-FDG with an integrated PET/MRI scanner followed by radical prostatectomy were included. The prostate was divided into six segments (sextants) according to anatomical landmarks. Three radiologists noted the presence and location of cancer in each sextant on four different image interpretation modalities in consensus (1, multiparametric MRI; 2, integrated 18 F-FDG PET/MRI; 3, integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI; and 4, combined interpretation of 1 and 18 F-FDG PET/CT). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic performance based on the DOR (diagnostic odds ratio) and NNM (number needed to misdiagnose) were evaluated for each interpretation modality, using the pathologic result as the reference standard. Detection rates of seminal vesicle invasion and extracapsular invasion were also evaluated.  Results:   Integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI showed significantly higher sensitivity than did multiparametric MRI alone in high Gleason score patients (77.0% and 66.2%, P = 0.011), low Gleason score patients (66.7% and 47.4%, P = 0.007), and total patients (72.5% and 58.0%, P = 0.008) groups. Integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI and 18 F-FDG PET/MRI showed similar sensitivity and specificity to combined interpretation of multiparametric MRI and 18 F-FDG PET/CT (for sensitivity, 58.0%, 63.4%, 72.5%, and 68.7%, respectively, and for specificity, 87.3%, 80.0%, 81.8%, 72.7%, respectively, in total patient group). However, integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI showed the best diagnostic performance (as DOR, 11.875 in total patients, 27.941 in high Gleason score patients, 5.714 in low Gleason score groups) among the imaging modalities, regardless of Gleason score. Integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI showed higher sensitivity and diagnostic performance than did integrated 18 F-FDG PET/MRI (as DOR, 6.917 in total patients, 15.143 in high Gleason score patients, 3.175 in low Gleason score groups) in all three patient groups.  Conclusion:   Integrated PET/MRI carried out using a dedicated integrated PET/MRI scanner provides better sensitivity, accuracy, and diagnostic value for detection/localization of prostate cancer compared to multiparametric MRI. Generally, integrated 18 F-choline PET/MRI shows better sensitivity, accuracy, and diagnostic performance than does integrated 18 F-FDG PET/MRI as well as combined interpretation of multiparametric MRI with 18 F-FDG PET/CT.

Unlike gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists, a GnRH antagonist such as degarelix can achieve castrate levels of testosterone without testosterone flare. However, normalization of serum testosterone levels following completion of neoadjuvant ADT in either form of treatment has never been compared in clinical trials.  Methods/design:   This is a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled study that will compare the efficacy and safety of degarelix with those of existing GnRH agonists combined with (125)I-TPPB. A total of 56 patients with low/intermediate-risk clinically localized PCa will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment groups: the GnRH agonist group and the degarelix group. Patients in the GnRH agonist group will receive leuprorelin acetate or goserelin acetate, and those in the degarelix group will receive the initial dose of 240 mg as 2 subcutaneous injections of 120 mg each, and then 80 mg of maintenance doses every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Those randomly assigned to the 12-week intervention period will subsequently undergo 48-weeks of follow-up after (125)I-TPPB. The primary endpoint is defined as normalization of serum testosterone levels (>50 ng/dL) following completion of neoadjuvant ADT. All patients will be assessed every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks for the next 36 weeks after administrations of these drugs. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of normalized serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the percent reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) compared with pretreatment levels, the percent reduction in total prostate volume (TPV) during neoadjuvant ADT, the percent increase in TPV after (125)I-TPPB, the percent reduction in hemoglobin, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), changes in free testosterone and bone mineral content measurement, the proportion of patients who have serum testosterone levels over 50 ng/dL at 12 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant ADT, and the improvement of quality of life (QOL).  Discussion:   The present study will provide additional insight regarding the benefit and potency of degarelix and will examine its potential as a new option for administration in neoadjuvant ADT.

We tested the link between sexual function and prostate cancer risk adjusting for multiple demographic and clinical characteristics using logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the associations with risk of low-grade (Gleason â¤6) and high-grade (Gleason â¥7 or â¥4 + 3) disease versus no cancer. Of 448 men, 209 (47%) had a positive biopsy; these men were less likely to be white (43% vs 55%, P = 0.013), had higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (6.0 vs 5.4 ng ml-1 , P < 0.001), but with lower mean sexual function score (47 vs 54, P = 0.007).

Physical function is a known predictor of morbidity and mortality, with initial evidence indicating that presurgical exercise is associated with fewer postsurgical complications and shorter hospitalization. The aim was to determine the feasibility of a supervised presurgical exercise program for prostate cancer (PCa) patients scheduled for prostatectomy.  Methods:   Ten men (68+6.4 years old) with localized PCa undertook a 6-week resistance and aerobic exercise program prior surgery. Training was undertaken twice weekly and patients were assessed at baseline, presurgery, and 6 weeks postsurgery. Outcome measures included muscle and physical performance, body composition, urinary incontinence and questionnaire.  Results:   Muscle strength increased by 7.5% to 24.3% ( P < .05) from baseline to presurgery but decreased to pretraining levels postsurgery, except for knee extensor strength ( P = .247). There were significant improvements ( P < .05) in the 6-m fast walk (9.3%), 400-m walk (7.4%), and chair rise (12.3%) at presurgery. Following surgery, improvements in physical performance were maintained. There was no change in lean or fat mass prior to surgery, but lean mass declined by 2.7 kg ( P = .014) following surgery. There were no adverse effects from the exercise program.  Conclusions:   Exercise undertaken prior to prostatectomy improved muscle and physical performance, with functional benefits maintained 6 weeks postsurgery. Presurgical exercise for PCa patients has the potential to facilitate recovery by improving physical reserve capacity, especially in men with poor muscle nd physical performance.""","""['Favil Singh', 'Robert U Newton', 'Michael K Baker', 'Nigel A Spry', 'Dennis R Taaffe', 'Jeffery Thavaseelan', 'Daniel A GalvÃ£o']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Feasibility and Efficacy of Presurgical Exercise in Survivors of Rectal Cancer Scheduled to Receive Curative Resection.', 'Prehabilitation for men undergoing radical prostatectomy: a multi-centre, pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'A multicentre year-long randomised controlled trial of exercise training targeting physical functioning in men with prostate cancer previously treated with androgen suppression and radiation from TROG 03.04 RADAR.', 'Exercise and prostate cancer: From basic science to clinical applications.', 'Effects of resistance exercise in prostate cancer patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Exercise medicine for cancer cachexia: targeted exercise to counteract mechanisms and treatment side effects.', 'Perceptions of wellbeing and quality of life following participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer: A qualitative pilot study.', 'Preoperative exercise interventions to optimize continence outcomes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Supported progressive resistance exercise training to counter the adverse side effects of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Resistance Exercise Dosage in Men with Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression.']"""

Herein, a fascinating potentiometric addressable photoelectrochemical biosensor was reported for double biomarkers' detection by varying the applied bias in the detection process. In this biosensor, the nanocomposite of cube anatase TiO2 mesocrystals and polyamidoamine dendrimers modified a dual disk electrode as an excellent photoelectrochemical sensing matrix. Subsequently, two important biomarkers in serum for prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen and human interleukin-6, were immobilized onto the different disks of modified electrode via glutaraldehyde bridges. Then another two photosensitizers, graphitic-carbon-nitride-labeled and CS-AgI-labeled different antibodies, were self-assembled onto the electrode surface by a corresponding competitive immune recognition reaction. The change in photocurrent with the target antigen concentration at different critical voltages enables us to selectively and quantitatively determine targets. The results demonstrated that this potentiometric addressable photoelectrochemical biosensing strategy not only has great promise as a new point-of-care diagnostic tool for early detection of prostate cancer but also can be conveniently expanded to multiplex biosensing by simply change biomarkers.

Methods:   A total 140 men (mean age 48 years) were enrolled and treated in this study. All patients were administered IDIProstÂ® Gold (Crocus sativus, PMBE, Serenoa repens) once daily for three months. At visit (T0) and after ninety days of treatment (T90), the patients were evaluated and asked to complete two self-administered questionnaires: International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). The main outcomes were the improved IIEF-5 and IPSS scores in the 40-60 age group. The secondary outcome was the improved quality of life score among treated patients.  Results:   The baseline mean scores at T0 were 17.29 and 15.12 for the IPSS and IIEF-5 respectively. After three months of treatment (T90), the questionnaire results were as follows: 10.21 and 20.53 for IPSS and IIEF-5 respectively. Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) were reported between the two visits in terms of IPSS and IIEF-5 for all the groups treated, but particularly the 40-60 age group.

For prostate cancer however, statins are known to compete with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) for the transport into the cytosol both using the cell by the Solute Carrier Transporter and thus diminish the cellular uptake of DHEAS as a precursor of androgens. Abiraterone inhibits CYP17A1 and thus effectively decreases the production of all relevant androgens including DHEAS. In this study we examined whether statins still affect survival outcome in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) when treated with Abiraterone.  Patients and methods:   108 men with mCRPC treated with Abiraterone from 02/2010 to 07/2015 with (n = 21) or without (n = 87) concomitant treatment with statins were investigated. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier-estimates and univariate Cox-regression analysis. The influence on best clinical benefit under Abiraterone treatment was analyzed with bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   PSA-decline â¥ 50% was not significantly different in both groups (57 vs. 53%; p = 0.73). The median PFS (9 vs. 10 months; p = 0.97) and OS (14 vs. 18 months; p = 0.77) did not differ significantly between those men treated with and without concomitant statin therapy, respectively. Accordingly, there was no improvement for best clinical benefit in patients using statins (odds ratio: 1.2 (CI: 0.4-4.2); p = 0.76).

It acts as an endocrine disruptor targeting steroid hormone receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), estrogen-related receptor (ERR) and androgen receptor (AR). BPA-derived molecules have recently been shown to interact with the AR N-terminal domain (AR-NTD), which is known to be largely intrinsically disordered. This N-terminal domain contains an 11 residue conserved domain that forms amyloid fibers upon oxidative dimerisation through its strictly conserved Cys240 residue. We investigate here the interaction of BPA, and other potential endocrine disruptors, with AR-NTD amyloid fibers using the WaterLOGSY NMR experiment. We observed a selective binding of these compounds to the amyloid fibers formed by the AR-NTD conserved region and glutamine homopolymers. This observation suggests that the high potency of endocrine disruptors may result, in part, from their ability to bind amyloid forms of nuclear receptors in addition to their cognate binding sites. This property may be exploited to design future therapeutic strategies targeting AR related diseases such as the spinal bulbar muscular atrophy or prostate cancer. The ability of NMR WaterLOGSY experiments to detect weak interactions between small ligands and amyloid fibers may prove to be of particular interest for identifying promising hit molecules.""","""['Julia Asencio-HernÃ¡ndez', 'Bruno Kieffer', 'Marc-AndrÃ© Delsuc']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Reversible amyloid fiber formation in the N terminus of androgen receptor.', 'An Amyloidogenic Sequence at the N-Terminus of the Androgen Receptor Impacts Polyglutamine Aggregation.', 'Androgen and Progesterone Receptors Are Targets for Bisphenol A (BPA), 4-Methyl-2,4-bis-(P-Hydroxyphenyl)Pent-1-Ene--A Potent Metabolite of BPA, and 4-Tert-Octylphenol: A Computational Insight.', 'Nuclear receptor profiling of bisphenol-A and its halogenated analogues.', 'A sting in the tail: the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor as a drug target.', 'Endocrine Disruptors Acting on Estrogen and Androgen Pathways Cause Reproductive Disorders through Multiple Mechanisms: A Review.', '1D NMR WaterLOGSY as an efficient method for fragment-based lead discovery.']"""

Eupafolin induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels in cathepsin S-dependent manner, and over-expression of Mcl-1 markedly blocked apoptosis induced by combined treatment with eupafolin and TRAIL. In addition, eupafolin increased Bim expression at the post-translational levels via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated inhibition of proteasome activity. Knock-down of Bim expression by siRNA inhibited eupafolin plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, combined treatment with eupafolin and TRAIL reduced tumor growth in xenograft models.

Among those younger than 65, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79 and 80 years or older, observed survival vs NCCN predicted life expectancy in years was similar at 10.4 vs 11.1, 10.0 vs 7.8, 6.2 vs 6.4, 4.4 vs 4.9 and 3.7 vs 3.3, respectively. Yet within the lowest quartile there was significant heterogeneity in survival among men with differing Charlson scores. For example, men age 65 to 69 years with Charlson scores 2, 3 and 4+ had an observed median survival greater than 13.3, 9.4 and 4.3 years, respectively. NCCN guidelines misclassified 10-year life expectancy in 24% and 56% of men age less than 65 and 65 to 69 years, and 5-year life expectancy in 18% of men age 70 to 74 years.  Conclusions:   While NCCN predictions matched observed survival on average for the lowest quartile of health, there was substantial heterogeneity in survival by Charlson scores. More granular assessments of life expectancy should be used for those at highest risk for mortality.""","""['Timothy J Daskivich', 'Lauren N Wood', 'Douglas Skarecky', 'Thomas Ahlering', 'Stephen Freedland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: Estimated life expectancy: integration of age and comorbidities.', 'Undertreatment of Men in Their Seventies with High-risk Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Questioning the 10-year Life Expectancy Rule for High-grade Prostate Cancer: Comparative Effectiveness of Aggressive vs Nonaggressive Treatment of High-grade Disease in Older Men With Differing Comorbid Disease Burdens.', 'Variation in treatment associated with life expectancy in a population-based cohort of men with early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Predicting Life Expectancy in Men Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.', 'Point: the value of predicting life expectancy in men with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer therapy personalization via multi-modal deep learning on randomized phase III clinical trials.', 'Time Trends in Use of Radical Prostatectomy by Tumor Risk and Life Expectancy in a National Veterans Affairs Cohort.', 'Influence of Baseline Cardiovascular Comorbidities on Mortality after Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Claims-Based Approach to Predict Cause-Specific Survival in Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Estimated life expectancy: integration of age and comorbidities.']"""

We investigated the effect of African-American race on pathological upgrading and/or up staging at prostatectomy in men with clinically low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We queried the National Cancer Database for men with low risk prostate cancer (clinical stage T2a or less, Gleason score 6 or less, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) treated with radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2013. The outcomes were pathological upgrading to Gleason score greater than 6 (primary) or Gleason score greater than 3+4=7 (secondary) and/or up staging (pathological T3-4 or N1 disease). The association between race and the end points was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. To further adjust for potential confounders, stratification by urban residence and comorbidity score, and subgroup analyses were performed.  Results:   With adjustment for age, comorbidity, income, urban residence, T stage, prostate specific antigen and percentage of positive biopsy cores, African-American race conferred 1.2-fold higher odds of pathological upgrading to Gleason score greater than 6 and/or up staging (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, p <0.01). African-American race also was an independent predictor of pathological upgrading to Gleason score greater than 3+4=7 and/or up staging (p=0.03).  Conclusions:   African-American men with low risk prostate cancer are more likely to harbor higher risk disease, which may lead to adverse outcomes. This finding alone does not preclude active surveillance. However, race should be considered as men weigh the risks and benefits of active surveillance vs treatment.""","""['Matthew J Maurice', 'Debasish Sundi', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Robert Abouassaly']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Incidence and Predictors of Upgrading and Up Staging among 10,000 Contemporary Patients with Low Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Comorbid Disease Burden is Independently Associated with Higher Risk Disease at Prostatectomy in Patients Eligible for Active Surveillance.', 'Pathological and Biochemical Outcomes among African-American and Caucasian Men with Low Risk Prostate Cancer in the SEARCH Database: Implications for Active Surveillance Candidacy.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

The study is nested among 9,582 men with incident prostate cancer within a prospective cohort of 336,381 Swedish construction workers. Information on tobacco use was collected at study entry between 1971 and 1992, and categorized into (i) never users of any tobacco, (ii) exclusive snus: ever users of snus only, (iii) exclusive smokers: ever smokers (cigarette, cigar and/or pipe) only and (iv) ever users of both snus and smoking. Hazard ratios for prostate cancer-specific and total mortality for smoking and snus use based on Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, calendar period at diagnosis and body mass index at baseline. During 36 years of follow-up, 4,758 patients died-2,489 due to prostate cancer. Compared to never users of tobacco, exclusive smokers were at increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27) and total mortality (HR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.26). Exclusive snus users also had increased risks for prostate cancer mortality (HR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.49) and total mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04-1.37). Among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic disease, the HR for prostate cancer death among exclusive snus users was 3.17 (95% CI: 1.66-6.06). The study is limited by a single assessment of tobacco use prior to diagnosis. Snus use was associated with increased risks of prostate cancer and total mortality among prostate cancer patients.

The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±) is the main regulator under the hypoxic environment. HIF-1Î± regulates various genes to enhance tumour progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK-1) is a modulator of HIF-1Î±.  Methods:   To investigate the molecular mechanisms of pristimerin in association with SPHK-1 pathways in hypoxic PC-3 cancer cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, cell cycles, and SPHK-1 activity were measured, and western blotting, an MTT assay, and an RNA interference assay were performed.  Results:   Pristimerin inhibited HIF-1Î± accumulation in a concentration- and-time-dependent manner in hypoxic PC-3 cells. Pristimerin suppressed the expression of HIF-1Î± by inhibiting SPHK-1. Moreover, inhibiting SPHK-1 with a sphingosine kinase inhibitor enhanced the suppression of HIF-1Î±, phosphorylation AKT, and glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) by pristimerin under hypoxia. Furthermore, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger enhanced the inhibition of HIF-1Î± and SPHK-1 by pristimerin.

In this manuscript the impact of applying the CRM with different prior skeleton approaches and the 3 + 3 method are compared in terms of ability to determine the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and number of patients allocated to sub-optimal and toxic doses.  Methods:   Post-hoc dose-escalation analyses on real-life clinical trial data on an early oncology compound (AZD3514), using the 3 + 3 method and CRM using six different prior skeleton approaches.  Results:   All methods correctly identified the true MTD. The 3 + 3 method allocated six patients to both sub-optimal and toxic doses. All CRM approaches allocated four patients to sub-optimal doses. No patients were allocated to toxic doses from sigmoidal, two from conservative and five from other approaches.  Conclusions:   Prior skeletons for the CRM for phase 1 clinical trials are proposed in this manuscript and applied to a real clinical trial dataset. Highly accurate initial skeleton estimates may not be essential to determine the true MTD, and, as expected, all CRM methods out-performed the 3 + 3 method. There were differences in performance between skeletons. The choice of skeleton should depend on whether minimizing the number of patients allocated to suboptimal or toxic doses is more important.

Main recommendations:   Key points and recommendations are:Excess cardiovascular events have been reported in some but not all studies of older men without pathological hypogonadism who were given testosterone treatment. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether testosterone therapy influences cardiovascular risk.Testosterone is the native hormone that should be replaced in men being treated for pathological hypogonadism. Convenient and cost-effective treatment modalities include depot intramuscular injection and transdermal administration (gel, cream or liquid formulations).Monitoring of testosterone therapy is recommended for efficacy and safety, focusing on ameliorating symptoms, restoring virilisation, avoiding polycythaemia and maintaining or improving bone mineral density.Treatment aims to relieve an individual's symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency by administering standard doses and maintaining circulating testosterone levels within the reference interval for eugonadal men.Evaluation for cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer risks should be undertaken as appropriate for eugonadal men of similar age. Nevertheless, when there is a reasonable possibility of substantive pre-existing prostate disease, digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen testing should be performed before commencing testosterone treatment.Changes in management as result of the position statement: Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency, using convenient and effective formulations of testosterone.

Prostate volume (PV) was determined by ultrasound.  Results:   A total of 4208 participants met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the whole participants was 65.8Â±7.7 years. Overall, participants with LUTS/BPH accounted for 61.4% (2584/4208) of the respondents, whose data were processed in the following statistical analysis. Generally, prostate enlargement was greatest in south China. LUTS and male sexual dysfunction (MSD) were most severe in northwest China. Based on multivariable analysis, PV enlarged as the age (p<0.001), body mass index (BMI; p<0.001) and vegetable intake (p<0.001) increased. Age (p<0.001) and BMI (p<0.05) independently increased the IPSS. A higher level of education (p<0.001) and more frequent meat, fish and egg intake (p<0.05) decreased the IPSS. Age (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), low education level (p<0.05), vegetable intake (p=0.001), and milk and dairy product intake (p=0.001) decreased the IIEF-5 score.

Materials and methods:   At a single institution between January 2007 and June 2014, we reviewed 277 men who first underwent a negative transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy of the prostate, and who then subsequently underwent a second biopsy. Detection rates were compared via Chi-square analysis. Race, age, PSA, presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, presence of atypical small acinar proliferation, prostate volume, PSA velocity and PSA density were compared via a multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   496 AA men and 352 Caucasian men underwent initial biopsy, and AA men had a 49 % cancer detection rate, compared to 34 % in Caucasians (p < 0.0001). AA men also had a greater incidence of Gleason 7 cancers (p = 0.00018) and a smaller mean TRUS volume (p = 0.006) compared to Caucasians. On repeat biopsy, AA men no longer had a higher cancer detection rate (p = 0.227), nor difference in Gleason 7 detection or TRUS volume (p = 0.0992). On initial biopsy, AA race and increasing PSA were both associated with an increased likelihood for cancer detection (p < 0.001 for both). After an initial negative biopsy, AA race no longer predicted for future malignancy detection (p = 0.57), nor did PSA (p = 0.36).

A magnetic field causes a deflection of electrons in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, and it leads to less lateral scattering along the direction parallel with the magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to determine the influence of the magnetic field on the electron behavior and on the total dose distribution around an Ir-192 source. Furthermore, the influence of air pockets being present near the source was studied. The Monte Carlo package Geant4 was utilized for the simulations. The simulated geometries consisted of a simplified point source inside a water phantom. Magnetic field strengths of 0 T, 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T were considered. The simulation results demonstrated that the dose distribution was nearly unaffected by the magnetic field for all investigated magnetic field strengths. Evidence was found that, from a dose perspective, the HDR prostate brachytherapy treatment using Ir-192 can be performed safely inside the MRI scanner. No need was found to account for the magnetic field during treatment planning.

A reduction in volume during external beam radiation therapy may lead to the exposure of normal tissues to an unexpected dose. In fact, prostate volume reductions have primarily been reported in European and American institutions. Although the prostate volume of Japanese patients is known to be small, the trends in prostate volume change during radiation therapy remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the changes in prostate volume of Japanese patients during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with NAD. Nineteen Japanese patients with prostate cancer underwent IMRT with NAD. Kilovoltage computed tomography (CT) images were obtained for treatment planning and verification of the treatment position for each treatment fraction. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the duration of NAD, as follows: NAD < 3 months (short NAD: S-NAD), 3 months â¤ NAD < 6 months (middle NAD: M-NAD), and NAD â¥ 6 months (long NAD: L-NAD). The prostate volume reductions at the 36th treatment fraction, relative to the planning CT, were 7.8%, 2.0%, and 1.7% for the S-NAD, M-NAD, and L-NAD groups, respectively. Prostate volume shrunk greater in the S-NAD group than in the M-NAD and L-NAD groups; this finding was consistent with those of previous studies.

Whole blood mRNA has been used in studies on a number of cancers, most notably two separate studies that used whole blood mRNA to define non-overlapping signatures of prostate cancer that has become castration independent. Prostate cancer is known to rely on androgens for initial growth, and there is increasing evidence on the importance of the androgen axis in advanced disease. Using whole blood mRNA samples from patients with prostate cancer, we have identified the four-gene panel of FAM129A, MME, KRT7 and SOD2 in circulating mRNA that are differentially expressed in a discovery cohort of metastatic samples. Validation of these genes at the mRNA and protein level was undertaken in additional cohorts defined by risk of relapse following surgery and hormone status. All the four genes were downregulated at the mRNA level in the circulation and in primary tissue, but this was not always reflected in tissue protein expression. MME demonstrated significant differences in the hormone cohorts, whereas FAM129A is downregulated at the mRNA level but is raised at the protein level in tumours. Using published ChIP-seq data, we have demonstrated that this may be due to AR binding at the FAM129A and MME loci in multiple cell lines.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from men with low-risk prostate cancer who were treated with low-dose rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT), proton beam therapy, or robotic-assisted prostatectomy. Patient-reported outcomes comprised the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50 domains for sexual function, urinary incontinence and/or bother, bowel bother, and vitality 12 months after treatment. Costs were measured by time-driven activity-based costing for the first 12 months of the care cycle. Outcome and cost data were plotted on a single radar chart for each treatment modality.  Results:   Outcome and cost data from patients who were treated with robotic-assisted prostatectomy (n = 381), proton beam therapy (n = 165), and LDR-BT (n = 238) were incorporated into the radar chart. LDR-BT seemed to deliver the highest overall value of the three treatment modalities; however, incorporation of patient preferences regarding outcomes may allow other modalities to be considered high-value treatment options.  Conclusion:   Standardization and visualization of outcome and cost metrics may allow more comprehensive and collaborative discussions about the value of health care services. Communicating the value framework by using radar charts may be an effective method to present total value and the value of all outcomes and costs in a manner that is accessible to all stakeholders.

Treatment involves coordination within oncology health-care teams and across other teams of referring primary and specialty providers (a team of teams). Each team interfaces with patients and caregivers to offer component parts of comprehensive care. Because patients frequently obtain specialty care from divergent health-care systems resulting in cross-system health-care use, oncology teams need mechanisms to coordinate and collaborate within and across health-care systems to optimize clinical outcomes for all cancer patients. Transactive memory is one potential strategy that can help improve comprehensive patient care delivery. Transactive memory is a process by which two or more team professionals develop a shared system for encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Each professional is responsible for retaining only part of the total information. Applying this concept to a team of teams results in system benefits wherein all teams share an understanding of specialized knowledge held by each component team. The patient's role as the unifying member of the team of teams is central to successful treatment delivery. This clinical case presents a patient who is receiving oral treatment for advanced prostate cancer within two health systems. The case emphasizes the potential for error when multiple teams function without a point team (the team coordinating efforts of all other primary and specialty teams) and when the specialty knowledge of providers and patients is not well integrated into all phases of the care delivery process.""","""['Elizabeth Henry', 'Abigail Silva', 'Elizabeth Tarlov', 'Cheryl Czerlanis', 'Margie Bernard', 'Cynthia Chauhan', 'Denise Schalk', 'Greg Stewart']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Improving the Transition From Oncology to Primary Care Teams: A Case for Shared Leadership.', 'Impact of Interprofessional Teamwork on Aligning Intensive Care Unit Care with Patient Goals: A Qualitative Study of Transactive Memory Systems.', 'Influence of transactive memory on perceived performance, job satisfaction and identification in anaesthesia teams.', 'Team science and critical care.', 'Advanced practice nursing, health care teams, and perceptions of team effectiveness.', 'IMPACT the Brain: A Team-Based Approach to Management of Metastatic Breast Cancer With CNS Metastases.', 'Understanding primary care-oncology relationships within a changing healthcare environment.', 'Innovating Cancer Care Delivery: the Example of the 4R Oncology Model for Colorectal Cancer Patients.']"""

We have previously established that over-expression of I-kappa-B-kinase-epsilon (IKKÎµ also named IKKi or IÎºBKÎµ) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines induces IL-6 secretion.

We observed a significant growth delay in IKKÎµ-silenced PC-3 cells injected in SCID mice fed with a doxycycline-supplemented diet in comparison with mice fed with a normal diet. We also found a decrease in IL-6 secretion levels that strongly correlated with tumor growth inhibition.

Although our patient's blood pressure steadily decreased during the procedure, his systolic blood pressure remained above 80 mmHg while he was tilted head downward at an angle of 28Â°. However, his blood pressure dropped immediately after he was returned to the horizontal position and abdominal insufflation - to create a pneumoperitoneum - was ceased at the end of surgery. We returned the patient to a head-down tilt to keep his blood pressure stable and began fluid infusion. Blood test results indicated that a hemorrhage was the cause of his hypotension. Open abdominal surgery was performed to stop the bleeding. The surgeons found blood pooling inside his abdomen from a longitudinal cut in a small arterial vessel in his abdominal wall, possibly a branch of his external iliac artery. The surgeons successfully controlled the hemorrhage and our patient was moved to our intensive care unit. Our patient recovered completely over the next few days, without any neurological deficits.  Conclusions:   We suspect that blood began to pool in our patient's superior abdomen during surgery, and that increased intra-abdominal pressure suppressed the hemorrhage. When our patient was returned to the horizontal position and insufflation of his abdomen was discontinued, the resulting increased rate of hemorrhage caused a sudden drop in blood pressure. Surgeons and anesthesiologists must understand the hemodynamic changes that result from head-down patient positioning and abdominal insufflation.""","""['Shoko Nakano', 'Junko Nakahira', 'Toshiyuki Sawai', 'Noriko Kadono', 'Toshiaki Minami']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Med Case Rep""","""['Changes in cardiac function and hemodynamics during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with steep head-down tilt: a prospective observational study.', 'Hemodynamic perturbations during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 45Â° Trendelenburg position.', 'Cardiovascular and respiratory effects of the degree of head-down angle during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Prevention of complications of general anesthesia linked with laparoscopic access and with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: how does it compare with other surgical approaches?', 'Unexpected hemorrhage of a rare vessel, a pubic branch of the external iliac artery, after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: Case report.', 'Stylistic features of case reports as a genre of medical discourse.']"""

Clinical and histopathological variables were used to calculate Partin estimates and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. MRI results in terms of extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph-node invasion (N+) were recorded. Using RP pathology as gold standard, we developed multivariate logistic regression models based on clinical variables, Partin Tables, and CAPRA score, and assessed their predictive accuracy before and after the addition of MRI results. Five hundred and one patients were included. MRI + clinical models outperformed clinical-based models alone for all outcomes. Comparing Partin and Partin + MRI predictive models, the areas under the curve were 0.61 versus 0.73 for ECE, 0.75 versus 0.82 for SVI, and 0.82 versus 0.85 for N+. Comparing CAPRA and CAPRA + MRI models, the areas under the curve were 0.69 versus 0.77 for ECE, 0.75 versus 0.83 for SVI, and 0.82 versus 0.85 for N+.

All current hormone therapies for CRPC target the C-terminal ligand-binding domain of AR and ultimately all fail with resumed AR transcriptional activity. Within the AR N-terminal domain (NTD) is activation function-1 (AF-1) that is essential for AR transcriptional activity. Inhibitors of AR AF-1 would potentially block most AR mechanisms of resistance including constitutively active AR splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Here we provide evidence that sintokamide A (SINT1) binds AR AF-1 region to specifically inhibit transactivation of AR NTD. Consistent with SINT1 targeting AR AF-1, it attenuated transcriptional activities of both full-length AR and constitutively active AR splice variants, which correlated with inhibition of growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells expressing AR splice variants. In vivo, SINT1 caused regression of CRPC xenografts and reduced expression of prostate-specific antigen, a gene transcriptionally regulated by AR. Inhibition of AR activity by SINT1 was additive to EPI-002, a known AR AF-1 inhibitor that is in clinical trials (NCT02606123). This implies that SINT1 binds to a site on AF-1 that is unique from EPI. Consistent with this suggestion, these two compounds showed differences in blocking AR interaction with STAT3.

Characterizing aberrant DNA methylation changes associated with prostate carcinogenesis could potentially identify a tumour-specific methylation pattern, facilitating the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The objective of the study was to assess the methylation status of 40 tumour suppressor genes in prostate cancer and healthy prostatic tissues.  Methods:   We used methylation specific-multiplex ligation probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay in two independent case series (training and validation set). The training set comprised samples of prostate cancer tissue (n = 40), healthy prostatic tissue adjacent to the tumor (n = 26), and healthy non prostatic tissue (n = 23), for a total of 89 DNA samples; the validation set was composed of 40 prostate cancer tissue samples and their adjacent healthy prostatic tissue, for a total of 80 DNA samples.

Our current understanding of prostate lineage specification stems from the use of developmental model systems that rely upon the embryonic preprostatic urogenital sinus mesenchyme to induce the formation of mature prostate epithelial cells. It is unclear, however, how the urogenital sinus epithelium can derive both adult urethral glands and prostate epithelia. Furthermore, the vast disparity in disease initiation between these two glands highlights key developmental factors that predispose prostate epithelia to hyperplasia and cancer. In this study we demonstrate that the caudal MÃ¼llerian duct mesenchyme (CMDM) drives prostate epithelial differentiation and is a key determinant in cell lineage specification between urethral glands and prostate epithelia. Utilizing both human embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic tissues, we document that the CMDM is capable of inducing the specification of androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, NKX3.1, and Hoxb13-positive prostate epithelial cells.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 13,904 urology outpatients who had undergone biopsy for the indications of prostate specific antigen greater than 4.0 ng/ml or prostate specific antigen less than 4.0 ng/ml but with abnormal digital rectal examination results. The prostate specific antigen measurements were performed in accordance with the standard procedures at the respective institutions. The type of assay used was documented and recalibrated to the WHO standard.  Results:   The incidence of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer was lower in the Chinese cohort than the Western cohorts at any given prostate specific antigen level. Around 25% of patients with a prostate specific antigen of 4.0 to 10.0 ng/ml were found to have prostate cancer compared to approximately 40% in U.S. clinical practice. Moreover, the risk curves were generally flatter than those of the Western cohorts, that is risk did not increase as rapidly with higher prostate specific antigen.  Conclusions:   The relationship between prostate specific antigen and prostate cancer risk differs importantly between Chinese and Western populations, with an overall lower risk in the Chinese cohort.

We investigated gene expression associated with radiosensitisation of normoxic and hypoxic prostate cancer cells by vorinostat.  Methods:   Cells were exposed to vorinostat under normoxia or hypoxia and subjected to gene expression profiling before irradiation and clonogenic survival analysis.  Results:   Pretreatment with vorinostat led to radiosensitisation of the intrinsically radioresistant DU 145 cells, but not the radiosensitive PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells, and was independent of hypoxia status. Knockdown experiments showed that the sensitisation was not caused by repression of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1 or tumour protein TP53. Global deregulation of DNA repair and chromatin organisation genes was associated with radiosensitisation under both normoxia and hypoxia. A radiosensitisation signature with expression changes of 56 genes was generated and valid for both conditions. For eight signature genes, baseline expression also correlated with sensitisation, showing potential as pretreatment biomarker. The hypoxia independence of the signature was confirmed in a clinical data set.

Patients and methods:   Between November 2005 and December 2010, 355 eligible men with cT1c-T3aN0M0 PCa and intermediate-risk and high-risk factors (2005 National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria) were randomized to 4 months of AD combined with HDRT (median dose, 78 Gy) (STAD) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of AD (LTAD). Treatment-related complications were assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 scoring schemes. Multivariate analyses for late toxicity were done using the Fine-Gray method.  Results:   The 5-year incidence of grade â¥2 rectal and urinary toxicity was 11.1% and 8.2% for LTAD and 7.6% and 7.3% for STAD, respectively. Compared with STAD, LTAD was not significantly associated with a higher risk of late grade â¥2 rectal toxicity (hazard ratio [HR] 1.360, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.660-2.790, P=.410) or urinary toxicity (HR 1.028, 95% CI 0.495-2.130, P=.940). The multivariate analysis showed that a baseline history of intestinal comorbidity (HR 3.510, 95% CI 1.560-7.930, P=.025) and the rectal volume receiving >60 Gy (Vr60) (HR 1.030, 95% CI 1.001-1.060, P=.043) were the only factors significantly correlated with the risk of late grade â¥2 rectal complications. A history of previous surgical prostate manipulations was significantly associated with a higher risk of grade â¥2 urinary complications (HR 2.427, 95% CI 1.051-5.600, P=.038). Long-term AD (HR 2.090; 95% CI 1.170-3.720, P=.012) and a history of myocardial infarction (HR 2.080; 95% CI 1.130-3.810, P=.018) were significantly correlated with a higher probability of cardiovascular events.

Surgical series have shown that pathologic (p)N1 PC does not behave the same in all patients. The aim of this study was to perform a matched-case analysis to compare the outcome of pN1 and pN0 PC after high-dose EBRT plus ADT.  Methods and materials:   Radiation therapy up to 80 Gy was delivered to the prostate with a minimal dose of 45 Gy to the pelvis for pN1 patients. After matching, Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare the 5-year biochemical and clinical relapse-free survival (bRFS and cRFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS). Acute and late rectal and urinary toxicity was evaluated.  Results:   Sixty-nine pN1 PC patients were matched 1:1 with pN0 PC patients. The median follow-up time was 60 months. The 5-year bRFS and cRFS for pN1 versus pN0 PC patients were 65% Â± 7% versus 79% Â± 5% (P=.08) and 70% Â± 6% versus 83% Â± 5% (P=.04) respectively. No significant difference was found in bRFS or cRFS rates between low volume pN1 (â¤2 positive LNs) and pN0 patients. The 5-year PCSS and OS were comparable between pN1 and pN0 PC patients: PCSS: 92% Â± 4% versus 93% Â± 3% (P=.66); OS: 82% Â± 5% versus 80% Â± 5% (P=.58). Severe toxicity was rare for both groups, although pN1 patients experienced significantly more acute grade 2 rectal toxicity.  Conclusion:   Primary EBRT plus 2 to 3 years of ADT is a legitimate treatment option for pN1 PC patients, especially those with â¤2 positive LNs, and this with bRFS and cRFS rates comparable to those in pN0 PC patients. For pN1 PC patients with >2 positive LNs, bRFS and cRFS are worse than in pN0 patients, but even in this subgroup, long-term disease control is obtained.""","""['Annelies Van Hemelryk', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Piet Ost', 'Filip Poelaert', 'Werner De Gersem', 'Karel Decaestecker', 'Pieter De Visschere', 'ValÃ©rie Fonteyne']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A Comparison Between Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy With or Without Androgen Deprivation, External Beam Radiation Therapy With or Without Androgen Deprivation, and Radical Prostatectomy With or Without Adjuvant or Salvage Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Outcomes and prognostic factors in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: multi-institutional analysis of the Spanish RECAP database.', 'Posttreatment Prostate-Specific Antigen 6\xa0Months After Radiation With Androgen Deprivation Therapy Predicts for Distant Metastasis-Free Survival and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on survival in men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Radiotherapy and Hormone Treatment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Tolerability of concurrent external beam radiotherapy and 177LuLu-PSMA-617 for node-positive prostate cancer in treatment naÃ¯ve patients, phase I study (PROQURE-I trial).', 'Sentinel Node Procedure to Select Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with Occult Nodal Metastases for Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy.', 'PEARLS - A multicentre phase II/III trial of extended field radiotherapy for androgen sensitive prostate cancer patients with PSMA-avid pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes at presentation.', '11C-Choline PET Guided Salvage Radiation Therapy for Isolated Pelvic and Paraortic Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Rationale and Early Genitourinary or Gastrointestinal Toxicities.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer with seminal vesicle involvement (T3b): A multicentric retrospective analysis.']"""

Research work has been on-going to assess if there are other better tests suitable for primary or secondary screening of PCa to supplement the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which fails to work accurately in a grey zone of 4-10ng/ml. In this pilot study, the potential roles of urinary polyamines as prostate cancer biomarkers were evaluated. PCa, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls (HC) showing PSA>4.0ng/ml were enrolled in the study. Their urine samples were obtained, and the urinary levels of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and Student's t-test were used to evaluate their diagnostic accuracies. Among the three biogenic polyamines, Spm had demonstrated a good diagnostic performance when comparing their levels in PCa patients with BPH patients (1.47 in PCa vs 5.87 in BPH; p<0.0001). Results are in accordance with transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy (TRUSPB) results, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.83Â±0.03.

Therapeutic options to treat the disease in advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) include cystectomy and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is effective in MIBC; however, it has not been widely adopted by the community. One reason is that many patients do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and no biomarker currently exists to identify these patients. It is also not clear whether a strategy to sensitize chemoresistant patients may exist. We sought to identify cisplatin-resistance patterns in preclinical models of bladder cancer, and test whether treatment with the epigenetic modifier decitabine is able to sensitize cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines. Using a screening approach in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines, we identified dysregulated genes by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and DNA methylation assays. DNA methylation analysis of tumors from 18 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy was used to confirm in vitro results. Cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells were treated with decitabine to investigate epigenetic sensitization of resistant cell lines. Our results show that HOXA9 promoter methylation status is associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in bladder cancer cell lines and in metastatic bladder cancer. Bladder cancer cells resistant to cisplatin chemotherapy can be sensitized to cisplatin by the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine. Our data suggest that HOXA9 promoter methylation could serve as potential predictive biomarker and decitabine might sensitize resistant tumors in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.""","""['Evanguelos Xylinas', 'Melanie R Hassler', 'Dazhong Zhuang', 'Martin Krzywinski', 'Zeynep Erdem', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Thomas Clozel', 'Shahrokh F Shariat']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['TAp73 expression and P1 promoter methylation, a potential marker for chemoresponsiveness to cisplatin therapy and survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).', 'Candidate DNA methylation drivers of acquired cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer identified by methylome and expression profiling.', 'An Oncofetal Glycosaminoglycan Modification Provides Therapeutic Access to Cisplatin-resistant Bladder Cancer.', 'Regulation of cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer by epigenetic mechanisms.', 'Using the neoadjuvant chemotherapy paradigm to develop precision therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Editorial: Epigenetic drugs and therapeutic resistance for epithelial malignancies.', 'Syngeneic model of carcinogen-induced tumor mimics basal/squamous, stromal-rich, and neuroendocrine molecular and immunological features of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Modulating epigenetic modifications for cancer therapy (Review).', 'Targeting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) enhanced antiproliferative and apoptotic response in bladder cancer.', 'High HOXA9 gene expression predicts response to chemotherapy and prognosis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.']"""

To study the therapeutic effects of clinically used anti-androgens we characterized herein a tissue-mimetic three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model whereby PCa cells were cultured alone or with PCa-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Notably, the ratio of PCa cells to CAFs significantly increased in time in favor of the tumor cells within the spheroids strongly mimicking PCa in vivo. Despite this loss of CAFs, the stromal cells, which were not sensitive to androgen and even stimulated by the anti-androgens, significantly influenced the sensitivity of PCa cells to androgen and to the anti-androgens bicalutamide and enzalutamide. In particular, DuCaP cells lost sensitivity to enzalutamide when co-cultured with CAFs. In LAPC4/CAF and LNCaP/CAF co-culture spheroids the impact of the CAFs was less pronounced. In addition, 3D spheroids exhibited a significant increase in E-cadherin and substantial expression of vimentin in co-culture spheroids, whereas AR levels remained unchanged or even decreased. In LNCaP/CAF spheroids we further found increased Akt signaling that could be inhibited by the phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, thereby overcoming the anti-androgen resistance of the spheroids. Our data show that CAFs influence drug response of PCa cells with varying impact and further suggest this spheroid model is a valuable in vitro drug testing tool.""","""['Theresa Eder', 'Anja Weber', 'Hannes Neuwirt', 'Georg GrÃ¼nbacher', 'Christian Ploner', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Natalie Sampson', 'Iris E Eder']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis.', 'Sonic hedgehog and androgen signaling in tumor and stromal compartments drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Anti-androgen 2-hydroxyflutamide modulates cadherin, catenin and androgen receptor phosphorylation in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cell lines acting via PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', '3D Tumor Models in Urology.', ""Let's Go 3D!

The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.  Results:   We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network. Finally, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we confirm that the biological knowledge captured by our method is relevant to the disease and consistent with the specialised literature and with an independent dataset not used in the inference process.

Methods:   This study included 101 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with RARP. To evaluate the status of periurethral inflammation, most apical urethral tissues in RARP specimens from these patients were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies for tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²). Masson trichrome staining (MTS) of these specimens was also performed to determine the degree of periurethral fibrosis. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the correlation between several factors and the postoperative continence status.  Results:   Of the 101 patients, urinary continence was achieved in 37 and 62 at 1 and 3 months after RARP, respectively. Immunohistochemical study revealed that 59, 41, and 56 patients were positive for TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and MTS, respectively, and the findings on MTS were significantly correlated with those on TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² expressions. At 1 month after RARP, the proportions of patients positive for TNF-Î± expression and MTS, but not for IL-1Î² expression, in the incontinence group were significantly greater than those in the continence group, whereas at 3 months after RARP, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the incontinence group was judged to be positive for TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² expressions, but not for MTS, than in the continence group. The following factors were identified as independent predictors of the continence status: preoperatively observed detrusor overactivity and TNF-Î± expression at 1 month after RARP, and TNF-Î± expression at 3 months after RARP.

Over the study period, among low-risk patients, observation increased from 9.2% to 21.3%, while radical prostatectomy (RP) increased from 29.5% to 51.1% (p<0.001 for both). In contrast, external beam radiotherapy decreased from 24.3% to 14.5%, while brachytherapy decreased from 31.7% to 11.1%. A similar pattern was seen for patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease. Among high-risk patients, RP increased from 25.1% to 43.4% replacing external beam radiotherapy as the dominant therapy. On multivariate analysis, racial minorities, the uninsured, and low-income patients were less likely to receive RP. Low-risk patients in similar subgroups were significantly more likely to be observed. Limitations include potential miscoding or misclassification of variables.  Conclusions:   Patterns of care in localized prostate cancer are changing rapidly. While use of observation is increasing in low-risk groups, the use of RP is increasing across all risk groups with a concomitant decline in use of radiotherapy. Socioeconomic factors appear to influence management choice.  Patient summary:   In this report we identify a recent significant increase in the use of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients. Socioeconomic factors such as race, insurance type, and income may affect treatments offered to and received by patients.""","""['Phillip J Gray', 'Chun Chieh Lin', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Jason A Efstathiou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Patterns of Care for Prostate Cancer Patients: Predictors of Care, But For Whom?', 'Re: Phillip J.

Sampling of the signal also destroys polarization, resulting in a limited temporal ability to observe biologically interesting reactions. In this study, we demonstrate that sampling hyperpolarized signals using a permanent magnet at 1 Tesla (1T) is a simple and cost-effective method to increase T1s without sacrificing signal-to-noise.

However, given the lack of uniform criteria for managing low risk prostate cancer, men who qualify for active surveillance might have less intensive surveillance and, thus, experience poorer outcomes. In this study we examined racial disparities in the frequency and intensity of active surveillance between African-American and Caucasian men.  Materials and methods:   Using the linked SEER-Medicare data set we identified 13,374 men with low risk prostate cancer (defined by the D'Amico criteria) diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 and then followed through 2011. A total of 2,916 men did not receive any treatment (radiation, hormonal therapy or surgery) within 1 year after diagnosis. Men were considered to be on active surveillance if they had at least 1 of the following 3 surveillance strategies within 2 years after diagnosis, namely 1 or more prostate biopsies, 4 or more prostate specific antigen tests, and/or 4 or more visits to the doctor with prostate cancer listed as the diagnosis. To compare the frequency of active surveillance between the groups (African-American vs Caucasian) we used the chi-square test. To estimate the odds ratio of active surveillance we used multivariable logistic regression after adjusting for possible confounders such as year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, socioeconomic status and Charlson score.  Results:   Of the 2,916 untreated men 1,141 (39%), including 963 (37%) Caucasian men and 178 (58%) African-American men (p <0.0001), did not undergo any of the 3 surveillance strategies but instead were essentially on watchful waiting. Caucasian men (vs African-American) were more likely to be on active surveillance, with 1,646 (63.1%) vs 129 (42.0%) opting for 1 surveillance strategy (p <0.0001), 783 (30.0%) vs 50 (16.3%) opting for any 2 strategies (p <0.0001) and 193 (7.4%) vs 11 (3.6%) going through all 3 (p=0.01). On multivariable analysis African-American men had significantly lower odds of being on active surveillance than Caucasian men (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.67). Men with more comorbidities (Charlson score 1 or greater) had significantly higher odds of being placed on active surveillance than watchful waiting (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.46-2.12).  Conclusions:   Among those not treated for low risk prostate cancer, Caucasian men were placed on active surveillance more frequently than African-American men, who often defaulted to de facto watchful waiting after an initial period of active surveillance. This discrepancy raises questions about the factors favoring watchful waiting over active surveillance. Moreover, given the lack of consensus regarding the most efficient active surveillance strategy, we anticipate that racial disparities in the use of active surveillance will persist, especially in African-American patients.""","""['Suprita Krishna', 'Yunhua Fan', 'Stephanie Jarosek', 'Oluwakayode Adejoro', 'Karim Chamie', 'Badrinath Konety']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'African American Race is Not Associated with Risk of Reclassification during Active Surveillance: Results from the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study.', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Velocity With Clinical Progression Among African American and Non-Hispanic White Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', ""Race/ethnicity and the intensity of medical monitoring under 'watchful waiting' for prostate cancer."", 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Time Trends and Variation in the Use of Active Surveillance for Management of Low-risk Prostate Cancer in the US.', 'Racial Disparities and Mental Health Effects Within Prostate Cancer.', '8-Hydroxy-2-Deoxyguanosine and 8-Iso-Prostaglandin F2Î±: Putative Biomarkers to assess Oxidative Stress Damage Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Intensity of observation with active surveillance or watchful waiting in men with prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Following an Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen Test.']"""

Population-based family studies have provided evidence that at least some of these mutations are associated with breast cancer risk as high as those associated with rare BRCA2 mutations. We aimed to estimate the relative risks associated with specific rare variants in PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM via a multicentre case-control study.  Methods:   We genotyped 10 rare mutations using the custom iCOGS array: PALB2 c.1592delT, c.2816T>G and c.3113G>A, CHEK2 c.349A>G, c.538C>T, c.715G>A, c.1036C>T, c.1312G>T, and c.1343T>G and ATM c.7271T>G. We assessed associations with breast cancer risk (42 671 cases and 42 164 controls), as well as prostate (22 301 cases and 22 320 controls) and ovarian (14 542 cases and 23 491 controls) cancer risk, for each variant.  Results:   For European women, strong evidence of association with breast cancer risk was observed for PALB2 c.1592delT OR 3.44 (95% CI 1.39 to 8.52, p=7.1Ã10-5), PALB2 c.3113G>A OR 4.21 (95% CI 1.84 to 9.60, p=6.9Ã10-8) and ATM c.7271T>G OR 11.0 (95% CI 1.42 to 85.7, p=0.0012). We also found evidence of association with breast cancer risk for three variants in CHEK2, c.349A>G OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.29 to 3.95), c.1036C>T OR 5.06 (95% CI 1.09 to 23.5) and c.538C>T OR 1.33 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.67) (pâ¤0.017). Evidence for prostate cancer risk was observed for CHEK2 c.1343T>G OR 3.03 (95% CI 1.53 to 6.03, p=0.0006) for African men and CHEK2 c.1312G>T OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.06 to 4.63, p=0.030) for European men. No evidence of association with ovarian cancer was found for any of these variants.  Conclusions:   This report adds to accumulating evidence that at least some variants in these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer that is clinically important.""","""['Melissa

Dietary saturated fat content impacts serum cholesterol levels. However, epidemiologic associations between saturated fat and PC aggressiveness are inconsistent. We hypothesized that high saturated fat intake would be associated with increased PC aggressiveness, and that statin use would modify this association.  Methods:   Of 1854 PC cases in the North Carolina-Louisiana PC Project, 321 (17%) were classified as high aggressive (Gleason sum â©¾8, PSA>20 ng ml-1, or Gleason sum â©¾7 and clinical stage T3-4) or low/intermediate aggressive (all other cases). Using low/intermediate aggressive cases as the referent group, we examined the association between tertiles of total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake and high aggressive PC using logistic regression, overall and stratified by race and statin use. We examined total fat-adjusted polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA and MUFA, respectively), trans fat and cholesterol intake in secondary analysis.  Results:   High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with an elevated odds ratio (OR) for aggressive PC (ORT3vsT1 1.51; 95% CI 1.10-2.06; P-trend=0.009), with an attenuated association in statin users (ORT3vsT1 1.16; 95% CI 0.67-2.01; P-trend=0.661) compared with non-users (ORT3vsT1 1.71; 95% CI 1.16-2.51; P-trend=0.053). High total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake was associated with aggressive PC in European Americans (ORT3vsT1 1.62; 95% CI 1.02-2.58; P-trend=0.056), but not African Americans (ORT3vsT1 0.92; 95% CI 0.60-1.42; P-trend=0.750). High total fat-adjusted PUFA was inversely associated with PC aggressiveness (ORT3vsT1 0.75; 95% CI 0.55-1.03), although this was not significant. No associations were found between total fat-adjusted MUFA or trans fat and PC aggressiveness.  Conclusions:   High total fat-adjusted saturated fat intake was associated with increased PC aggressiveness, with a suggestion of a stronger effect in men not using statins. The association between total fat-adjusted cholesterol intake and PC aggressiveness was most pronounced in European Americans.""","""['E H Allott', 'L Arab', 'L J Su', 'L Farnan', 'E T H Fontham', 'J L Mohler', 'J T Bensen', 'S E Steck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Calcium, magnesium, and whole-milk intakes and high-aggressive prostate cancer in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP).', 'Statin Use and Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness: Results from the Population-Based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.', 'Carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African-American and European-American men in the North Carolina-Louisiana prostate cancer project (PCaP).', 'Dietary fatty acids and colorectal and prostate cancers: epidemiological studies.', 'Fat Intake Is Not Linked to Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Quantifying the Contributions of Environmental Factors to Prostate Cancer and Detecting Risk-Related Diet Metrics and Racial Disparities.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', ""The lipidomic profile of the tumoral periprostatic adipose tissue reveals alterations in tumor cell's metabolic crosstalk.""]"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 376 patients who underwent TRUS-PBx were randomized into 2 groups. Group-I (n = 198) received TPPB with 10 ml 2% prilocaine, and group-II (n = 178) received intrarectal administration of 10 ml 2% lidocaine gel followed by PPNB with 10 ml 2% prilocaine. A 10-point linear visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain arising from probe insertion (VAS-1) and prostate sampling (VAS-2).  Results:   VAS-1 scores were significantly lower in group-I than group-II (1.7 Â± 1.9 vs. 3.9 Â± 1.5; p < 0.001). Combining local anesthesia produced superior pain control to TPPB during sampling (2.0 Â± 1.2 vs. 2.5 Â± 2.4; p = 0.015). Following subgroup analyses with reference to concomitant anorectal pathologies, VAS-1 scores were significantly lower in group-I than group-II (2.0 Â± 1.8 vs. 5.5 Â± 1.7; p < 0.001). VAS-2 scores were lower in group-II than group-I; however, the difference was not considered significant (2.4 Â± 1.3 vs. 3.1 Â± 2.8; p = 0.303).  Conclusions:   In all patients referred for TRUS-PBx, TPPB is a good alternative to PPNB + gel.

However, the diagnostic yield among men with active surveillance (AS) remains undefined.  Objective:   To determine the utility of MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy during AS by reporting rates of PCa upgrading and comparing findings with systematic biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified patients with low- and intermediate-risk PCa enrolled in AS who received MRI-ultrasound fusion surveillance biopsies. All completed prostate multiparametric MRI with 3-T and endorectal coil reviewed by radiologists selecting regions of interest, and all underwent MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy with concurrent systematic biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We report MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy findings, rates of Gleason score (GS) upgrading to â¥3 + 4 (any upgrading) and to â¥4 + 3 (major upgrading), tumor involvement estimates using descriptive statistics, McNemar's test of symmetry, and multivariate logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 207 men underwent MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy following radiologic suspicion on multiparametric MRI and met inclusion criteria. Agreement between systematic and MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy GS was borderline statistically significant (p<0.047). In total, 83 men (40%) experienced any upgrading, including 49 (24%) on systematic sampling, 30 (14%) on MRI-targeted cores, and four (2%) on both. Among those with negative results on MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy, seven (9%) exhibited major upgrading with systematic biopsy. MRI suspicion scores were high (4/5) for all but two patients with any upgrading and for all who experienced major upgrading. On multivariate analysis, older age was associated with higher odds of any upgrading for men with GS â¤3 + 3 on previous biopsy (odds ratio: 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.20; p=0.03).  Conclusions:   MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy resulted in upgrading otherwise undetected by systematic biopsy among a proportion of men with PCa managed with AS. However, upgrading also occurred in areas outside targeted biopsy, suggesting that systematic sampling should be offered to men with AS even with history of extended sextant biopsy.  Patient summary:   This study examined the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion biopsy for men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance (AS). In some patients, MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy resulted in the detection of upgrade otherwise missed with systematic sampling. The findings indicate that MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy may help with better sampling during AS.""","""['Geraldine N Tran', 'Michael S Leapman', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Antonio C Westphalen', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy during Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'Standardized Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reporting Using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion with Transperineal Saturation Biopsy to Select Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound-fusion biopsy significantly upgrades prostate cancer versus systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

GSTP1 appears methylated in PCa and not in healthy tissue; IHC confirmed that methylation leads to protein underexpression (p < 0.001).

For these applications, it is critical to have water soluble nanoparticles. However, the synthesis of water soluble afterglow nanoparticles like Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ is a challenging issue because most afterglow materials are very complicated in composition that cannot be synthesized by simple chemical routes. Here, for the first time, Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ water soluble and stable nanoparticles are synthesize using a modified Sol-Gel method followed by the grinding and coating with APTES. The surface coating of the afterglow with APTES and the conjugation with PpIX and folic acid not only improve their water solubility but also enhance the PpIX luminescence by 10 times.

Disrupting luminal cell AR signaling in mouse models promotes cytokine production cell-autonomously, impairs epithelial barrier function, and induces immune cell infiltration, which further augments local production of cytokines and chemokines including Il-1 and Ccl2. This inflammatory microenvironment promotes AR-independent prostatic epithelial proliferation, which can be abolished by ablating IL-1 signaling or depleting its major cellular source, the macrophages.

But the precise mechanism of prostate cancer progression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) functioning in it, is still needs further study. We found miR-27a to be down-regulated in prostate cancer, and we investigated the mechanism and role of miRNA-27a in prostate cancer. MiR-27a, a transcriptional target of AR, was an androgen-induced miRNA in LNCaP cells. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells, we for the first time reported that miR-27a was downregulated by PI3K signaling. MiR-27a functioned as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Over-expression of miR-27a decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration, and induced prostate cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. MAP2K4, miR-27a's direct target gene, functioned as an oncogene in prostate cancer by reducing G1-S phase arrest and inhibiting cell apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, miR-27a functions as a tumor suppressor by suppressing MAP2K4 which acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer cell lines; we also provided a new mechanism of castration-resistant prostate cancer mediated by miR-27a that downregulation of miR-27a caused by aberrant AR signaling and PI3K/Akt signaling after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) would promote the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Xuechao Wan', 'Wenhua Huang', 'Shu Yang', 'Yalong Zhang', 'Pu Zhang', 'Zhe Kong', 'Tao Li', 'Hai Wu', 'Fengxiang Jing', 'Yao Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Androgen-induced miR-135a acts as a tumor suppressor through downregulating RBAK and MMP11, and mediates resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.', 'MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'MicroRNA-27a promotes proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting MAP2K4 in human osteosarcoma cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Association of Androgenic Regulation and MicroRNAs in Acinar Adenocarcinoma of Prostate.', 'Wnt/Î²-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'MiRNA-27a mediates insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 cells through the PPARÎ³.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Experiments from unfinished Registered Reports in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology.']"""

The methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins bind to methylated DNA and can aid in the mediation of gene silencing through interaction with histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases. However, the mechanisms responsible for eliciting CpG island hypermethylation in cancer, and the potential role that MBD proteins play in modulation of the methylome remain unclear. Our previous work demonstrated that MBD2 preferentially binds to the hypermethylated GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells. Here, we use functional genetic approaches to investigate if MBD2 plays an active role in reshaping the DNA methylation landscape at this locus and genome-wide. First, we show that loss of MBD2 results in inhibition of both maintenance and spread of de novo methylation of a transfected construct containing the GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells and Mbd2-/- mouse fibroblasts. De novo methylation was rescued by transient expression of Mbd2 in Mbd2-/- cells. Second, we show that MBD2 depletion triggers significant hypomethylation genome-wide in prostate cancer cells with concomitant loss of MBD2 binding at promoter and enhancer regulatory regions. Finally, CpG islands and shores that become hypomethylated after MBD2 depletion in LNCaP cancer cells show significant hypermethylation in clinical prostate cancer samples, highlighting a potential active role of MBD2 in promoting cancer-specific hypermethylation. Importantly, co-immunoprecipiation of MBD2 shows that MBD2 associates with DNA methyltransferase enzymes 1 and 3A. Together our results demonstrate that MBD2 has a critical role in 'rewriting' the cancer methylome at specific regulatory regions.""","""['C Stirzaker', 'J Z Song', 'W Ng', 'Q Du', 'N J Armstrong', 'W J Locke', 'A L Statham', 'H French', 'R Pidsley', 'F Valdes-Mora', 'E Zotenko', 'S J Clark']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', 'Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 represses transcription from hypermethylated pi-class glutathione S-transferase gene promoters in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein-2 mediates transcriptional repression associated with hypermethylated GSTP1 CpG islands in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins: readers of the epigenome.', 'Role of MBD2 in gene regulation and tumorigenesis.', 'Older postmenopausal women with lower lean mass have hypermethylated sites in the PI3K-Akt pathway.', 'Inhibitors of DNA Methylation.', 'Computational discovery of novel inhibitory candidates targeting versatile transcriptional repressor MBD2.', 'Increased Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain Protein 2 Promotes Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension.', 'Genetic or siRNA inhibition of MBD2 attenuates the UUO- and I/R-induced renal fibrosis via downregulation of EGR1.']"""

In this study we evaluated not only the harms but also the potential benefits of prostate cancer treatment in relieving the pretreatment urinary symptom burden.  Materials and methods:   In American (1,021) and Spanish (539) multicenter prospective cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer we evaluated the effects of radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy or brachytherapy in relieving pretreatment urinary symptoms and in inducing urinary symptoms de novo, measured by changes in urinary medication use and patient reported urinary bother.  Results:   Urinary symptom burden improved in 23% and worsened in 28% of subjects after prostate cancer treatment in the American cohort. Urinary medication use rates before treatment and 2 years after treatment were 15% and 6% with radical prostatectomy, 22% and 26% with external radiotherapy, and 19% and 46% with brachytherapy, respectively. Pretreatment urinary medication use (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, p = 0.04) and pretreatment moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.2-3.6) predicted prostate cancer treatment associated relief of baseline urinary symptom burden. Subjects with pretreatment lower urinary tract symptoms who underwent radical prostatectomy experienced the greatest relief of pretreatment symptoms (OR 4.3, 95% CI 3.0-6.1), despite the development of deleterious de novo urinary incontinence in some men. The magnitude of pretreatment urinary symptom burden and beneficial effect of cancer treatment on those symptoms were verified in the Spanish cohort.  Conclusions:   Men with pretreatment lower urinary tract symptoms may experience benefit rather than harm in overall urinary outcome from primary prostate cancer treatment.

The most common complications of PLND for prostate cancer are related to lymphocele formation, which occur in 30%-50% of patients according to studies that performed screening imaging. Although most are asymptomatic, when intervention is required the cost and morbidity are high.  Materials and methods:   Of 100 patients enrolled, 88 completed the study. Each patient served as his or her own control, with Arista AH placed over the field of PLND on only one side in a randomized fashion as revealed only after bilateral PLND was completed. All patients underwent screening pelvic computed tomography scan 3 months later, with radiologists blinded to the Arista AH treated side. A significant lymphocele was defined as a fluid collection 3 cm or greater in any plane.  Results:   The mean lymph node yield was 8.1 nodes. Fourteen lymphoceles were identified. Five occurred on the side where Arista AH was used vs 9 on untreated sides (5.7% vs 10.2%, P = .248). When they occurred, there was no statistically significant difference in lymphocele size between treated and untreated sides (P = .441). No lymphoceles were symptomatic.  Conclusion:   Although the lymphocele rate with Arista AH was 5.7% compared with 10.2% without it, this was not a statistically significant difference potentially because the study was underpowered due to an unusually low baseline rate of lymphoceles.

Ephs and their ligands ephrins play an important role in development and carcinogenesis. The expression of EphA3, an Eph family member, has been investigated in a variety of human cancers, with mixed results. High levels of EphA3 protein expression have been reported in colorectal, prostate, and gastric cancers, whereas loss of protein expression has been reported in lung and hematopoietic cancers. EphA3 expression in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its association with clinicopathological parameters has not previously been examined. The aim of this study was to determine the cancerous value of EphA3 protein expression in patients with ccRCC.  Materials and methods:   This study included 68 patients with ccRCC. EphA3 protein expression was examined in ccRCC tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and a specific polyclonal antibody, and the correlation between EphA3 expression and clinicopathological parameters was subsequently evaluated.  Results:   High EphA3 protein expression was observed in all normal renal tubules. In the 68 ccRCC patient samples examined, EphA3 protein expression was detected in 19 cases (27.9%) and undetectable in 49 cases (72.1%). EphA3 protein expression was significantly associated with tumor diameter (P = .016) and tumor, node metastases stage (P = .029). No significant association between protein expression and sex (P = .387), age (P = .727), or nuclear grade (P = .243) was found.  Conclusion:   Ourdata indicate that EphA3 protein expression is reduced in ccRCC, suggesting the possibility that this receptor functions as a tumor suppressor in this disease.""","""['Xiaolin Wang', 'Haifei Xu', 'Guangxin Cao', 'Zhijun Wu', 'Jiandong Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['hZIP1 that is down-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma is negatively associated with the malignant potential of the tumor.', 'Dicer is down-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and in vitro Dicer knockdown enhances malignant phenotype transformation.', 'Critical role of EphA3 in cancer and current state of EphA3 drug therapeutics.', 'miR-141 is a key regulator of renal cell carcinoma proliferation and metastasis by controlling EphA2 expression.', 'Eph receptors, ephrins, and PDZs gather in neuronal synapses.', 'EphA3 targeted by miR-3666 contributes to melanoma malignancy via activating ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways.', 'The Clinical Impact of the EPH/Ephrin System in Cancer: Unwinding the Thread.', 'Markers of Angiogenesis, Lymphangiogenesis, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (Plasticity) in CIN and Early Invasive Carcinoma of the Cervix: Exploring Putative Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Early Tumor Invasion.', 'Analysis of Single Circulating Tumor Cells in Renal Cell Carcinoma Reveals Phenotypic Heterogeneity and Genomic Alterations Related to Progression.', 'EPHA3 enhances macrophage autophagy and apoptosis by disrupting the mTOR signaling pathway in mice with endometriosis.']"""

The present study examined the potential interplay between HSP27 and YangZheng XiaoJi, a traditional Chinese medicine used in cancer treatment. A range of cell lines from different tumour types including pancreatic, lung, gastric, colorectal, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer (both wild-type and resistant) were used. Levels and activation of HSP27 and its potential associated signalling pathways were evaluated by protein array and western blotting. Knockdown of HSP27 in cancer cells was achieved using siRNA. Localisation and co-localisation of HSP27 and other proteins were carried out by immunofluorescence. Cell growth and migration were evaluated in their response to a range of chemotherapeutic agents. The present study first identified, by way of protein array, that YangZheng XiaoJi was able to inhibit the phosphorylation of HSP27 protein in cancer cells. We further demonstrated that HSP27, which is co-localised with caspase-9, can be blocked from localising in focal adhesions and co-localising with caspase-9 by YangZheng XiaoJi. The study also demonstrated that YangZheng XiaoJi was able to sensitise cancer cells including those cells that were resistant to chemotherapy, to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, knocking down HSP27 markedly reduced the migration of cancer cells and increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the inhibitory effect on cellular migration by YangZheng XiaoJi. YangZheng XiaoJi can act as an agent in first sensitising cancer cells to chemotherapy and secondly to overcome, to some degree, chemoresistance when used in an appropriate fashion in patients who have active HSP27.""","""['Sioned Owen', 'Huishan Zhao', 'Alwyn Dart', 'Yamei Wang', 'Fiona Ruge', 'Yong Gao', 'Cong Wei', 'Yiling Wu', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Impact of Yangzheng Xiaoji on the adhesion and migration of human cancer cells: the role of the AKT signalling pathway.', 'Antitumour effects of Yangzheng Xiaoji in human osteosarcoma: the pivotal role of focal adhesion kinase signalling.', 'Inhibitory effects of Yangzheng Xiaoji on angiogenesis and the role of the focal adhesion kinase pathway.', 'Hsp27 as a therapeutic target in cancers.', 'HSP27, 70 and 90, anti-apoptotic proteins, in clinical cancer therapy (Review).', 'An Integrated Approach to Protein Discovery and Detection From Complex Biofluids.', 'Discovery of Novel HSP27 Inhibitors as Prospective Anti-Cancer Agents Utilizing Computer-Assisted Therapeutic Discovery Approaches.', 'Traditional Chinese Medicine Targeting Heat Shock Proteins as Therapeutic Strategy for Heart Failure.', 'Ins and Outs of Heat Shock Proteins in Colorectal Carcinoma: Its Role in Carcinogenesis and Therapeutic Perspectives.', 'Heat Shock Proteins and Ovarian Cancer: Important Roles and Therapeutic Opportunities.']"""

Lack of functional DR expression in tumors is a major limiting factor. We report here that chromatin regulator KDM4A/JMJD2A, not KDM4B, has a pivotal role in silencing tumor cell expression of both TRAIL and its receptor DR5. In TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells of lung, breast and prostate, KDM4A small-molecule inhibitor compound-4 (C-4) or gene silencing strongly induces TRAIL and DR5 expression, and causes TRAIL-dependent apoptotic cell death. KDM4A inhibition also strongly sensitizes cells to TRAIL. C-4 alone potently inhibits tumor growth with marked induction of TRAIL and DR5 expression in the treated tumors and effectively sensitizes them to the newly developed TRAIL-inducer ONC201. Mechanistically, C-4 does not appear to act through the Akt-ERK-FOXO3a pathway. Instead, it switches histone modifying enzyme complexes at promoters of TRAIL and DR5 transcriptional activator CHOP gene by dissociating KDM4A and nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)-HDAC complex and inducing the recruitment of histone acetylase CBP. Thus, our results reveal KDM4A as a key epigenetic silencer of TRAIL and DR5 in tumors and establish inhibitors of KDM4A as a novel strategy for effectively sensitizing tumors to TRAIL pathway-based therapeutics.""","""['Junjian Wang', 'Haibin Wang', 'Ling-Yu Wang', 'Demin Cai', 'Zhijian Duan', 'Yanhong Zhang', 'Peng Chen', 'June X Zou', 'Jianzhen Xu', 'Xinbin Chen', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Hong-Wu Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['Inhibition of euchromatin histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 sensitizes breast cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand through reactive oxygen species-mediated activating transcription factor 4-C/EBP homologous protein-death receptor 5 pathway activation.', 'Small-Molecule ONC201/TIC10 Targets Chemotherapy-Resistant Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells in an Akt/Foxo3a/TRAIL-Dependent Manner.', 'Azadirone, a limonoid tetranortriterpene, induces death receptors and sensitizes human cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) through a p53 protein-independent mechanism: evidence for the role of the ROS-ERK-CHOP-death receptor pathway.', 'ONC201 and imipridones: Anti-cancer compounds with clinical efficacy.', 'Molecular targets of TRAIL-sensitizing agents in colorectal cancer.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.', 'Zinc finger myeloid Nervy DEAF-1 type (ZMYND) domain containing proteins exert molecular interactions to implicate in carcinogenesis.', 'Engineering human JMJD2A tudor domains for an improved understanding of histone peptide recognition.', 'KDM4 Involvement in Breast Cancer and Possible Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Long non-coding RNA KIKAT/LINC01061 as a novel epigenetic regulator that relocates KDM4A on chromatin and modulates viral reactivation.']"""

Materials and methods:   Twenty-four patients with primary, previously untreated PC were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent dynamic PET/CT (dPET/CT) scanning of the pelvis and whole-body PET/CT studies with Ga-PSMA-11. The evaluation of dPET/CT studies was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on two-tissue compartment modeling and a noncompartmental approach leading to the extraction of fractal dimension (FD).  Results:   A total of 23/24 patients (95.8%) were Ga-PSMA-11 positive. In 9/24 patients (37.5%), metastatic lesions were detected. PC-associated lesions demonstrated the following mean values: SUVaverage = 14.3, SUVmax = 23.4, K1 = 0.24 (1/min), k3 = 0.34 (1/min), influx = 0.15 (1/min), and FD = 1.27. The parameters SUVaverage, SUVmax, k3, influx, and FD derived from PC-associated lesions were significantly higher than respective values derived from reference prostate tissue. Time-activity curves derived from PC-associated lesions revealed an increasing Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation during dynamic PET acquisition. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate but significant correlation between PSA levels and SUVaverage (r = 0.60) and SUVmax (r = 0.57), and a weak but significant correlation between Gleason score and SUVaverage (r = 0.33) and SUVmax (r = 0.28).  Conclusion:   Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT confirmed its capacity in detecting primary PC with a detection rate of 95.8%.

Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) do not invariably promote cell proliferation; in the normal adult, endogenous stromal and epithelial AR activation maintains differentiation and inhibits organ growth. In the current study, we report that activation of AR differentially regulates the proliferation of human prostate epithelial progenitor cells, NHPrE1, in vitro and in vivo. Inducing AR signaling in NHPrE1 cells suppressed cell proliferation in vitro, concomitant with a reduction in MYC expression. However, ectopic expression of AR in vivo stimulated cell proliferation and induced development of invasive PCa in tissue recombinants consisting of NHPrE1/AR cells and rat urogenital mesenchymal (UGM) cells, engrafted under renal capsule of adult male athymic mice. Expression of MYC increased in the NHPrE1/AR recombinant tissues, in contrast to the reduction seen in vitro. The inhibitory effect of AR signaling on cell proliferation in vitro were reduced by co-culturing NHPrE1/AR epithelial cells with prostatic stromal cells.

We propose a novel, paradigm shifting hypothesis that this frequently deleted locus is also associated with a cluster of microRNA genes- miR-3622a/b- that are lost in PCa and play an important mechanistic role in progression and metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate the role of miR-3622b in prostate cancer. Expression analyses in a cohort of PCa clinical specimens and cell lines show that miR-3622b expression is frequently lost in prostate cancer. Low miR-3622b expression was found to be associated with tumor progression and poor biochemical recurrence-free survival. Further, our analyses suggest that miR-3622b expression is a promising prostate cancer diagnostic biomarker that exhibits 100% specificity and 66% sensitivity. Restoration of miR-3622b expression in PCa cell lines led to reduced cellular viability, proliferation, invasiveness, migration and increased apoptosis. miR-3622b overexpression in vivo induced regression of established prostate tumor xenografts pointing to its therapeutic potential. Further, we found that miR-3622b directly represses Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-3622b plays a tumor suppressive role and is frequently downregulated in prostate cancer, leading to EGFR upregulation. Importantly, miR-3622b has associated diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.

Elevated IL-7 expression has been reported to be observed in prostate cancer tissues and closely associated with poor prognosis. However, the biological functions of IL-7 and its receptor in prostate cancer cell invasiveness remain unclear. In our study, we found that the expressions of IL-7 and IL-7R were both upregulated in prostate cancer cells. IL-7 dose-dependently promoted the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of IL-7R attenuated the effect of IL-7. Further, IL-7/IL-7R axis induced the activation of AKT and NF-ÎºB, whereas blocking of AKT suppressed IL-7-mediated NF-ÎºB activity. Moreover, IL-7/IL-7R axis increased MMP-3 and MMP-7 expression of prostate cancer cells, whereas inhibition of NF-ÎºB as well as MMPs activity suppressed IL-7-mediated cell invasion and migration. Together, these data identify IL-7/IL-7R axis to be involved in prostate cancer cell invasion and migration, probably via activating AKT/NF-ÎºB pathway and upregulating MMP-3 and MMP-7 expression.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the ligand amount and injected activity on the tumor-to-normal tissue biologically effective dose (BED) ratio for 177Lu-labeled PSMA peptides. For this retrospective study, a recently developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was adapted for PSMA targeting peptides. General physiological parameters were taken from the literature. Individual parameters were fitted to planar gamma camera measurements (177Lu-PSMA I&T) of five patients with metastasizing prostate cancer. Based on the estimated parameters, the pharmacokinetics of tumor, salivary glands, kidneys, total body and red marrow was simulated and time-integrated activity coefficients were calculated for different peptide amounts. Based on these simulations, the absorbed doses and BEDs for normal tissue and tumor were calculated for all activities leading to a maximal tolerable kidney BED of 10 Gy2.5/cycle, a maximal salivary gland absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy/cycle and a maximal red marrow BED of 0.25 Gy15/cycle. The fits yielded coefficients of determination > 0.85, acceptable relative standard errors and low parameter correlations. All estimated parameters were in a physiologically reasonable range. The amounts (for 25-29 nmol) and pertaining activities leading to a maximal tumor dose, considering the defined maximal tolerable doses to organs of risk, were calculated to be 272Â±253 nmol (452Â±420 Î¼g) and 7.3Â±5.1 GBq. Using the actually injected amount (235Â±155 Î¼g) and the same maximal tolerable doses, the potential improvement for the tumor BED was 1-3 fold. The results suggest that currently given amounts for therapy are in the appropriate order of magnitude for many lesions. However, for lesions with high binding site density or lower perfusion, optimizing the peptide amount and activity might improve the tumor-to-kidney and tumor-to-salivary glands BED ratio considerably.""","""['Peter Kletting', 'Christiane Schuchardt', 'Harshad R Kulkarni', 'Mostafa Shahinfar', 'Aviral Singh', 'Gerhard Glatting', 'Richard P Baum', 'Ambros J Beer']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Effect of Total Tumor Volume on the Biologically Effective Dose to Tumor and Kidneys for 177Lu-Labeled PSMA Peptides.', 'Optimized Peptide Amount and Activity for â¹â°Y-Labeled DOTATATE Therapy.', 'Post-therapeutic dosimetry of 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Lutetium-177-labelled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody and ligands for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Predicting the effect of different folate doses on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', 'Improved quality control of 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.', 'Single-time-point dosimetry using model selection and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling: a proof of concept.', 'A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for 68GaGa-(HA-)DOTATATE to predict whole-body distribution and tumor sink effects in GEP-NET patients.', 'Theranostic digital twins for personalized radiopharmaceutical therapies: Reimagining theranostics via computational nuclear oncology.']"""

Patients and methods:   Our institution began to prospectively collect PAFP tissue in 2010. The PAFP was removed at the time of RP and sent as a pathological specimen separate from the pelvic LNs and prostate. Consecutive RPs performed at our institution in which the PAFP was removed were reviewed to determine the rate of LNs in the PAFP, the rate of metastatic LNs in the PAFP, and the association of metastatic PAFP LN with clinical and pathological features. The impact on biochemical recurrence (BCR) was assessed with a Cox's proportional hazard model.  Results:   In all, 2 413 PAFP specimens were available for analysis. LNs were found in the PAFP in 255 (10.6%) cases and metastatic LNs in the PAFPs were found in 14 (0.6%) cases. Metastatic PAFP LNs were associated with anterior tumours in 11 of the 14 cases (P = 0.01), and were present only in preoperative D'Amico intermediate- (six of 14) and high- (eight of 14) risk patients (P < 0.001).

Methods: Ninety-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, prospective intention-to-treat clinical trial for potential salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy. The initial treatment plan was based on the results from conventional abdominopelvic CT and MRI. The 45 patients in the experimental arm also underwent abdominopelvic 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT, and the images were registered with the conventional images to determine whether the results would modify the initial treatment plan. The 51 patients in the control arm did not undergo 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT. For each patient, the clinical and treatment-planning target volumes that would have been treated before 18F-fluciclovine registration were compared with those after registration. For organs at risk (rectum, bladder, and penile bulb), the volumes receiving 40 Gy and 65 Gy before registration were compared with those after registration. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired t test. Acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group was compared between the control and experimental arms using the Ï2 test. Results: In 24 cases, radiotherapy was planned to a clinical target volume consisting of the prostate bed alone (CTV) (64.8-66.6 Gy). In 21 cases, radiotherapy was planned to a clinical target volume consisting of the pelvis (CTV1) (45.0 Gy) followed by a boost to the prostate bed (CTV2) (19.8-25.2 Gy). In each case, the respective treatment-planning target volume expansion (PTV, PTV1, or PTV2) was 0.8 cm (0.6 cm posterior). With the exception of PTV2, all postregistration volumes were significantly larger than the corresponding preregistration volumes. Analysis of the rectum, bladder, and penile bulb volumes receiving 40 Gy and 60 Gy demonstrated that only the penile bulb volumes were significantly higher after registration. No significant differences in acute genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity were observed.

NeoBOMB1 is a novel DOTA-coupled GRPR antagonist with high affinity for GRPR and excellent in vivo stability. The purpose of this preclinical study was to further explore the use of NeoBOMB1 for theranostic application by determining the biodistribution of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1.  Methods:   PC-3 tumor-xenografted BALB/c nu/nu mice were injected with either approximately 13 MBq/250 pmol 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 or a low (â¼1 MBq/200 pmol) versus high (â¼1 MBq/10 pmol) peptide amount of 177Lu-NeoBOMB1, after which biodistribution and imaging studies were performed. At 6 time points (15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min for 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 1, 4, 24, 48, 96, and 168 h for 177Lu-NeoBOMB1) postinjection tumor and organ uptake was determined. To assess receptor specificity, additional groups of animals were coinjected with an excess of unlabeled NeoBOMB1. Results of the biodistribution studies were used to determine pharmacokinetics and dosimetry. Furthermore, PET/CT and SPECT/MRI were performed.  Results:   Injection of approximately 250 pmol 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 resulted in a tumor and pancreas uptake of 12.4 Â± 2.3 and 22.7 Â± 3.3 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of tissue, respectively, at 120 min after injection. 177Lu-NeoBOMB1 biodistribution studies revealed a higher tumor uptake (17.9 Â± 3.3 vs. 11.6 Â± 1.3 %ID/g of tissue at 240 min after injection) and a lower pancreatic uptake (19.8 Â± 6.9 vs. 105 Â± 13 %ID/g of tissue at 240 min after injection) with the higher peptide amount injected, leading to a significant increase in the absorbed dose to the tumor versus the pancreas (200 pmol, 570 vs. 265 mGy/MBq; 10 pmol, 435 vs. 1393 mGy/MBq). Using these data to predict patient dosimetry, we found a kidney, pancreas, and liver exposure of 0.10, 0.65, and 0.06 mGy/MBq, respectively. Imaging studies resulted in good visualization of the tumor with both 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 177Lu-NeoBOMB1.

In this study, uPAR PET imaging using a 68Ga-labeled version of the uPAR-targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC, and UBC. The aim of this first-in-human, phase I clinical trial was to investigate the safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. Methods: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC, and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 (154 Â± 59 MBq; range, 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans (10 min, 1 h, and 2 h after injection). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, and SUVs were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest in the malignant tissue. Results: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq, leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when the clinical target dose of 200 MBq was used. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases.

EGF-stimulated EGFR is internalized and the process of endocytic degradation of EGFR mediates its signaling which is frequently dysregulated in many kinds of cancer. In the present study, we demonstrated that endophilin B1 expression was inhibited and EGFR expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that suppression of endophilin B1 increased EGFR levels via delaying EGFR internalization triggered by EGF and its intracellular degradation. Endophilin B1 decreased also sustained EGFR downstream signaling such as Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation and promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation which is EGF independent.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analysed 157 consecutive patients, with at least one prior negative systematic prostatic biopsy, who underwent transperineal prostate MRI/ultrasonography fusion-targeted biopsy between January 2014 and February 2016. Suspicious lesions were delineated using a 'region of interest' and the system calculated prostate volume and LV. Patients were divided in groups considering LV (â¤0.5, 0.5-1, â¥1 mL) and PI-RADS score (1-5). We considered clinically significant prostate cancer as all cancers with a Gleason score of â¥3 + 4 as suggested by PI-RADS v2. A direct comparison between MRI estimated LV (MRI LV) and histological tumour volume (HTV) was done in 23 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy during the study period. Differences between MRI LV and HTV were assessed using the paired sample t-test. MRI LV and HTV concordance was verified using a Bland-Altman plot. The chi-squared test and logistic and ordinal regression models were used to evaluate difference in frequencies.  Results:   The MRI LV and PI-RADS score were associated both with prostate cancer detection (both P < 0.001) and with significant prostate cancer detection (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). When the two variables were matched, increasing LV increased the risk within each PI-RADS group. Prostate cancer detection was 1.4-times higher for LVs of 0.5-1 mL and 1.8-times higher for LVs of â¥1 mL; significant prostate cancer detection was 2.6-times for LVs of 0.5-1 mL and 4-times for LVs of â¥1 mL. There was a positive correlation between MRI LV and HTV (r = 0.9876, P < 0.001). Finally, Bland-Altman analysis showed that MRI LV was underestimated by 4.2% compared to HTV.

Tacrolimus has been shown to be neuroprotective in the rat cavernous nerve injury model, an animal model representative of the neural injury that occurs in humans at the time of radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the utility of tacrolimus was assessed for prevention of erectile dysfunction following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Low dose tacrolimus, associated with low trough levels, resulted in mild hypomagnesemia, which was an early and persistent finding.

Although, various drugs targeting the androgen receptor are normally used, the patients frequently undergo recurrence of the disease. To overcome these limitations, natural compounds have been researched for evidence that they suppress progression and metastasis of various cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated effects of naringenin, a natural anti-oxidant flavonoid derived from citrus, on prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP). Results of present study with PC3 and LNCaP cells revealed that naringenin inhibited proliferation and migration, while inducing apoptosis and ROS production by those cells. In addition, naringenin-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in PC3 cells, but not LNCaP cells. In a dose-dependent manner, naringenin decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P70S6K, S6, and P38 in PC3 cells, and reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P53, P38, and JNK proteins in LNCaP cells. However, naringenin activated phosphorylation of AKT in both PC3 and LNCaP cells. Then, targeted signaling proteins associated with viability of PC3 and LNCaP cells were analyzed using pharmacological inhibitors of AKT and ERK1/2 cell signaling pathways. Moreover, we compared the apoptotic effects of naringenin and paclitaxel alone and in combination to find that naringenin enhanced the efficiency of paclitaxel to suppress progression of prostate cancer cell lines. Collectively, these results indicate that naringenin is a potential chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of prostate cancer. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1118-1131, 2017.

Additional studies report the proliferative effect of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on prostate cancer by its agonistic action on CHRM3. This study shows that the type 1 acetylcholine muscarinic receptor (CHRM1) contributes toward the proliferation and growth of prostate cancer. We used growth and cytotoxic assays, the prostate cancer microarray database and CHRM downstream pathways' homology of CHRM subtypes to uncover multiple signals leading to the growth of prostate cancer. Growth assays showed that pilocarpine stimulates the proliferation of prostate cancer. Moreover, it shows that carbachol exerts an additional agonistic action on nicotinic cholinergic receptor of prostate cancer cells that can be blocked by tubocurarine. With the use of selective CHRM1 antagonists such as pirenzepine and dicyclomine, a considerable inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines was observed in dose ranging from 15-60 Âµg/ml of dicyclomine. The microarray database of prostate cancer shows a dominant expression of CHRM1 in prostate cancer compared with other cholinergic subtypes.

Small molecules can elicit tissue selective effects, because the cells of distinct tissues express different levels and cohorts of coregulatory proteins. We reconfigured the AR-TIF2 PPI biosensor (PPIB) assay in the PC-3 CaP cell line to determine whether AR modulators and hits from an AR-TIF2 PPIB screen conducted in U-2 OS cells would behave differently in the CaP cell background. Although we did not observe any significant differences in the compound responses between the assay performed in osteosarcoma and CaP cells, the U-2 OS AR-TIF2 PPIB assay would be more amenable to screening, because both the virus and cell culture demands are lower. We implemented a testing paradigm of counter-screens and secondary hit characterization assays that allowed us to identify and deprioritize hits that inhibited/disrupted AR-TIF2 PPIs and AR transcriptional activation (AR-TA) through antagonism of AR ligand binding or by non-specifically blocking nuclear receptor trafficking. Since AR-TIF2 PPI inhibitor/disruptor molecules act distally to AR ligand binding, they have the potential to modulate AR-TA in a cell-specific manner that is distinct from existing anti-androgen drugs, and to overcome the development of resistance to AR antagonism.

We performed a prospective analysis in 139 metastatic patients with performance status > 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale. A decision was considered correct if patients treated with a medical anticancer treatment lived over 3 months or alternatively patients not treated had a survival under 3 months. The predominant tumor type was non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were chemotherapy naive in 87 cases (63 %). A new line of medical anticancer treatment was started in 107 cases (77 %). The median survival of the study population was 11 weeks (range, 1-53). 84 patients (60 %) died within 3 months while 55 patients (40 %) lived more than 3 months after decision.

The analysis by pathology allowed to identify pathologies where decisions were correct in the majority of the cases (renal, urothelial and small cell lung cancers), pathologies where appropriate and inappropriate decisions were balanced (prostate, ovarian and breast cancers) and pathologies where decisions for treatment were excessive (non-small cell lung cancer and unknown primary). This prospective study was conducted as part of the evaluation of professional practices in our department.

But combination therapy presents the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Due to the narrow window between therapeutic concentrations and onset of toxicity often observed with oncology therapeutics, managing DDIs with combination therapy in cancer is critical. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling can be effectively used for predicting DDIs and guiding dose-selection, but requires development of PBPK models of cancer drugs. Among various types of cancer, metastatic prostate cancer is an area of high unmet medical need with minimal therapeutic options. Recently, enzalutamide was approved for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and is often dosed as a combination in clinical practice. Enzalutamide is a potent CYP3A inducer and a model-based approach to guide dose-selection for enzalutamide combinations that are CYP3A substrates is needed.  Objective:   A ""fit for purpose"" PBPK model of enzalutamide was developed to illustrate the CYP3A4 induction potential, understand the kinetics of de-induction of CYP3A4 following cessation of enzalutamide dosing and guide dose-selection of a co-administered CYP3A substrate.  Method:   The population-based simulator, Simcyp, was used for model building purposes. Model input parameters were obtained from public information, primarily from the FDA summaries.  Results:   The simulated concentration time profiles of enzalutamide in healthy male subjects were comparable to observed profiles in male patients. Model predicted enzalutamide pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, i.e. AUC, Cmax and half-life were within 1.5-fold of observed results obtained from two reported studies, supporting verification of the PBPK model. Model application was demonstrated by simulating a drug-drug interaction between enzalutamide and midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Based on simulations, the midazolam AUC ratio ranged from 0.06 to 0.16 and was comparable to the observed ratio of 0.14. Based on modeling, upon cessation of enzalutamide dosing, it is predicted that at least 8 weeks are needed to re-attain baseline CYP3A4 activity. Based on PBPK modeling, dose adjustment of up to 3-fold for a co-administered CYP3A substrate was shown to re-attain baseline exposure.

Many oncogenic signaling pathways converge at the AP-1 transcription complex. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) is a multifunctional regulatory cytokine that regulates many aspects of cellular function, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, adhesion, angiogenesis, immune surveillance, and survival.  Methods:   This study investigated, the role of FOS proteins in TGF-Î² signaling in prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Steady state expression levels of FOS mRNA and proteins were determined using RT-PCR and western blotting analyses. DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells were exposed to TGF-Î²1 at varying time and dosage, RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses were used to determine TGF-Î²1 effect on FOS mRNA and protein expression levels as well as FosB subcellular localization. Transient silencing of FosB protein was used to determine its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Results:   Our data show that FOS mRNA and proteins were differentially expressed in human prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3). TGF-Î²1 induced the expression of FosB at both the mRNA and protein levels in DU145 and PC3 cells, whereas cFos and Fra1 were unaffected. Immunofluorescence analysis showed an increase in the accumulation of FosB protein in the nucleus of PC3 cells after treatment with exogenous TGF-Î²1. Selective knockdown of endogenous FosB by specific siRNA did not have any effect on cell proliferation in PC3 and DU145 cells. However, basal and TGF-Î²1- and EGF-induced cell migration was significantly reduced in DU145 and PC3 cells lacking endogenous FosB. TGF-Î²1- and EGF-induced cell invasion were also significantly decreased after FosB knockdown in PC3 cells.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that FosB is required for migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. We also conclude that TGF-Î²1 effect on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion may be mediated through the induction of FosB. Prostate 77:72-81, 2017.

Malignant transformation results in loss of polarization and overexpression of hypoglycosylated MUC1 carrying truncated carbohydrates known as T or Tn tumor antigens. Tumor MUC1 bearing Tn carbohydrates (Tn-MUC1) represent a potential target for immunotherapy. We evaluated the Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide in a human phase I/II clinical trial for safety that followed a preclinical study of different glycosylation forms of MUC1 in rhesus macaques, whose MUC1 is highly homologous to human MUC1. Either unglycosylated rhesus macaque MUC1 peptide (rmMUC1) or Tn-rmMUC1 glycopeptide was mixed with an adjuvant or loaded on autologous dendritic cells (DC), and responses were compared. Unglycosylated rmMUC1 peptide induced negligible humoral or cellular responses compared with the Tn-rmMUC1 glycopeptide. Tn-rmMUC1 loaded on DCs induced the highest anti-rmMUC1 T-cell responses and no clinical toxicity. In the phase I/II clinical study, 17 patients with nonmetastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) were tested with a Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide-DC vaccine. Patients were treated with multiple intradermal and intranodal doses of autologous DCs, which were loaded with the Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide (and KLH as a positive control for immune reactivity). PSA doubling time (PSADT) improved significantly in 11 of 16 evaluable patients (P = 0.037). Immune response analyses detected significant Tn-MUC1-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell intracellular cytokine responses in 5 out of 7 patients evaluated.

Materials and methods:   The study included 900 patients from a randomized trial (No. 5) by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group, comparing parenteral oestrogen with total androgen blockade. Extent of bone metastasis was categorized according to a modified Soloway score: score 1, n = 319; score 2, n = 483; and score 3, n = 98 patients. The primary outcome measurements were mean differences in QoL and overall survival.  Results:   QoL rating scales showed a decrease with increasing extent of bone metastasis (p < 0.001). The mean global health status decreased from 64.4 to 50.5 for Soloway score 1 and 3, respectively. Following adjustment for performance status, analgesic consumption, grade of malignancy, alkaline phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen, haemoglobin and global health status, Soloway score 2 and 3 had a 47% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.80] and 78% (HR 1.78 95%, CI 1.32-2.42) increased mortality, respectively, compared to Soloway score 1.

Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is aberrantly expressed in many cancers including primary prostate cancer (PCa), but its role in CRPC has not been reported.  Results:   LCN2 expression was upregulated in human primary PCa and CRPC tissues. Overexpression of LCN2 promoted C4-2B and 22RV1 cell proliferation while knockdown of LCN2 markedly inhibited C4-2B and 22RV1 cell growth. LCN2 overexpression led to increased AR downstream gene SLC45A3 without upregulating AR expression. In the xenograft model, overexpression of LCN2 significantly promoted tumor growth.  Methods:   LCN2 expression was detected in primary PCa and CRPC tissues and cell lines C4-2B and 22RV1 using immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. Serum LCN2 level was detected vi ELISA. Lentiviruses-mediated over-expression of LCN2 and LCN2 knockdown were performed in CRPC cell lines.

We next performed whole genomic copy number analysis of CTCs and matched patient leukocytes (germline) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) from 16 men with mCRPC, including longitudinal and sequential aCGH analyses of CTCs in the context of enzalutamide therapy.Results: All patients had mCRPC and primary or acquired resistance to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. We compiled copy gains and losses, with a particular focus on those genes highly implicated in mCRPC progression and previously validated as being aberrant in metastatic tissue samples and genomic studies of reference mCRPC datasets. Genomic gains in >25% of CTCs were observed in AR, FOXA1, ABL1, MET, ERG, CDK12, BRD4, and ZFHX3, while common genomic losses involved PTEN, ZFHX3, PDE4DIP, RAF1, and GATA2 Analysis of aCGH in a sample with sequential enzalutamide-resistant visceral progression showed acquired loss of AR amplification concurrent with gain of MYCN, consistent with evolution toward a neuroendocrine-like, AR-independent clone.Conclusions: Genomic analysis of pooled CTCs in men with mCRPC suggests a reproducible, but highly complex molecular profile that includes common aberrations in AR, ERG, c-MET, and PI3K signaling during mCRPC progression, which may be useful for predictive biomarker development.

Using a validated metric in men treated within the context of an RCT, we aimed to determine whether PSA failure is associated with the risk of ACM stratified by comorbidity score. Patients and Methods Between 1995 and 2001, 206 men with localized (T1b to 2b) intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) were randomly assigned to receive radiation therapy or radiation therapy and 6 months of ADT. Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether PSA failure modeled as a time-dependent covariate was associated with an increased risk of ACM among men with Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27-defined no or minimal versus moderate-to-severe comorbidity adjusting for age, PC prognostic factors, and treatment. Results After a median follow-up of 16.62 years, 156 men (76%) died, 29 of whom (19%) died as a result of PC. PSA failure was associated with an increased ACM risk among men with no or minimal (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.46; P = .04), but not moderate or severe comorbidity (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.76 to 3.99; P = .19). Conclusion Recommending treatment on the basis of reduced PSA failure observed from early results of RCTs is unlikely to prolong survival in men with moderate-to-severe comorbidity but may prolong survival in men with no or minimal comorbidity, providing evidence to support discussing the early results with these men.""","""['Nicholas J Giacalone', 'Jing Wu', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Andrew Renshaw', 'Marian Loffredo', 'Philip W Kantoff', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Errata.', 'The impact of comorbidity and PSA doubling time on the risk of death in men experiencing PSA failure following radiation therapy with or with androgen deprivation therapy for unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Duration of the anti-androgen in men undergoing 6 months of an LHRH agonist and radiation therapy for unfavorable-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death.', 'Evaluating the combined effect of comorbidity and prostate-specific antigen kinetics on the risk of death in men after prostate-specific antigen recurrence.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Biochemical Failure Is Not a Surrogate End Point for Overall Survival in Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Analysis of NRG Oncology/RTOG 9601.', 'Association of Increased Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels After Treatment and Mortality in Men With Locally Advanced vs Localized Prostate Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Tumor characteristics, treatments, and survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients with a PSA level\u2009<\u20094\u2009ng/ml: a population-based study.', 'Upregulation of Holliday junction recognition protein predicts poor prognosis and biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The impact of Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 on the clinical outcome of elderly nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy: a matched cohort analysis.']"""

Increasing numbers of reports are demonstrating that the activity of many of these proteolytically activated protein fragments can be attenuated by their selective degradation by the N-end rule pathway. Here we report the first evidence that selective degradation of a caspase product by the N-end rule pathway can be modulated by phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic fragment of the bone marrow kinase on chromosome X (BMX) generated by caspase cleavage in the prostate cancer-derived PC3 cell line is metabolically unstable in cells because its N-terminal tryptophan targets it for proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway. In addition, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrosine 566 relatively inhibits degradation of the C-terminal BMX catalytic fragment, and this phosphorylation is crucial for its pro-apoptotic function. Overall, our results demonstrate that cleaved BMX is a novel N-end rule substrate, and its degradation exhibits a novel interplay between substrate phosphorylation and N-end rule degradation, revealing an increasing complex regulatory network of apoptotic proteolytic signaling cascades.""","""['Mohamed A Eldeeb', 'Richard P Fahlman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Regulating Apoptosis by Degradation: The N-End Rule-Mediated Regulation of Apoptotic Proteolytic Fragments in Mammalian Cells.', 'Proteolytic activation of ETK/Bmx tyrosine kinase by caspases.', 'Tyrosine kinase Etk/BMX protects nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells from apoptosis induced by radiation.', 'The tyrosine kinase BMX is an essential mediator of inflammatory arthritis in a kinase-independent manner.', 'BMX and its role in inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.', 'Regulation of Neurodegeneration-associated Protein Fragments by the N-degron Pathways.', 'Signaling Pathways Regulated by UBR Box-Containing E3 Ligases.', 'Regulating Apoptosis by Degradation: The N-End Rule-Mediated Regulation of Apoptotic Proteolytic Fragments in Mammalian Cells.', 'Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of Imidazo4,5-f1,10phenanthroline Derivatives as Apoptosis Inducers in Chemotherapy by Stabilizing Bcl-2 G-quadruplex DNA.', 'The Architecture of Thiol Antioxidant Systems among Invertebrate Parasites.']"""

Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) is a legume lectin that recognizes terminal N-acetylgalactosaminides with high affinity. WFA preferentially binds the disaccharide LacdiNAc (Î²-d-GalNAc-[1â4]-d-GlcNAc), which is associated with tumor malignancy in leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers and has shown promise in cancer glycobiomarker detection. The mechanism of specificity for WFA recognition of LacdiNAc is not fully understood. To address this problem, we have determined affinities and structure of WFA in complex with GalNAc and LacdiNAc. Affinities toward Gal, GalNAc, and LacdiNAc were measured via surface plasmon resonance, yielding KD values of 4.67 Ã 10-4 m, 9.24 Ã 10-5 m, and 5.45 Ã 10-6 m, respectively. Structures of WFA in complex with LacdiNAc and GalNAc have been determined to 1.80-2.32 Ã resolution. These high resolution structures revealed a hydrophobic groove complementary to the GalNAc and, to a minor extent, to the back-face of the GlcNAc sugar ring. Remarkably, the contribution of this small hydrophobic surface significantly increases the observed affinity for LacdiNAc over GalNAc. Tandem MS sequencing confirmed the presence of two isolectin forms in commercially available WFA differing only in the identities of two amino acids. Finally, the WFA carbohydrate binding site is similar to a homologous lectin isolated from Vatairea macrocarpa in complex with GalNAc, which, unlike WFA, binds not only Î±GalNAc but also terminal Ser/Thr O-linked Î±GalNAc (Tn antigen).""","""['Omid Haji-Ghassemi', 'Michel Gilbert', 'Jenifer Spence', 'Melissa J Schur', 'Matthew J Parker', 'Meredith L Jenkins', 'John E Burke', 'Henk van Faassen', 'N Martin Young', 'Stephen V Evans']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Differential expression of LacdiNAc sequences (GalNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-R) in glycoproteins synthesized by Chinese hamster ovary and human 293 cells.', 'N-glycan structures of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac2 binding protein in the serum of patients with liver fibrosisâ .', 'Engineering of recombinant Wisteria floribunda agglutinin specifically binding to GalNAcÎ²1,4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc).', 'Wisteria floribunda agglutinin positive glycobiomarkers: a unique lectin as a serum biomarker probe in various diseases.', 'Differential binding properties of Gal/GalNAc specific lectins available for characterization of glycoreceptors.', 'B4GALNT3 regulates glycosylation of sclerostin and bone mass.', 'Decoding Strategies to Evade Immunoregulators Galectin-1, -3, and -9 and Their Ligands as Novel Therapeutics in Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Lung Tumor Cells with Different Tn Antigen Expression Present Distinctive Immunomodulatory Properties.', 'Systematic synthesis of bisected N-glycans and unique recognitions by glycan-binding proteins.', 'A Useful Guide to Lectin Binding: Machine-Learning Directed Annotation of 57 Unique Lectin Specificities.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study included 125 patients with metastatic RCC. Pretreatment PNI was calculated as 10 Ã serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 Ã total lymphocyte count (per mm3). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the correlation between pretreatment PNI and OS and PFS. Harrell concordance index was used to measure discrimination.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 45.3 months (interquartile range, 23.7-77.3 months). Decreased PNI was significantly associated with older female patients, poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, types of initial drug, and increased Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Heng risk score (P < .05). An increase in the PNI of 1 unit was associated with a 10% decrease in the risk of death from RCC (hazard ratio, 0.90; P < .001). In the multivariable analysis, the PNI was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P < .001).

However, its incidence and the significance for the clinical outcomes of patients treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) are uncertain.  Patients and methods:   A multicenter retrospective analysis of chemotherapy-naive patients treated with AA for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) was conducted. The baseline characteristics, treatment history of mCRPC, and serum PSA kinetics during AA treatment were collected. The log-rank test was applied to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between patient groups with a PSA flare according to the different definitions and immediate PSA declines.  Results:   The data from 83 patients were analyzed. An immediate PSA decline of any amount was observed in 59 patients (71.1%). According to the various definitions of PSA flare, its incidence ranged from 6.0% to 10.8%. Although the median interval to the peak PSA level was 0.95 month, regardless of the PSA flare definition, the interval to the PSA nadir showed a wide range of 2.8 to 7.6 months. In PSA flare subgroup, the median PFS in patients with any PSA decline to less than the baseline and > 30% decline from the baseline was 12.4 months. The PFS duration of PSA flare patients did not significantly differ from that of patients with an immediate PSA decline of any amount and immediate > 30% decline without PSA flare.  Conclusion:   The PSA flare phenomenon is not rare event during AA treatment. A PSA decline during AA treatment, with or without a PSA flare, was associated with favorable clinical outcomes. Thus, AA should not be withdrawn early in patients with mCRPC in whom an initial, isolated PSA increase has been observed.""","""['Yujiro Ueda', 'Nobuaki Matsubara', 'Ken-Ichi Tabata', 'Takefumi Satoh', 'Naoto Kamiya', 'Hiroyoshi Suzuki', 'Takashi Kawahara', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Independent association between time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and PSA progression-free survival in patients with docetaxel-naÃ¯ve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving abiraterone acetate, but not enzalutamide.', ""Abiraterone Acetate for Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in Chemotherapy-naive Patients: An Italian Analysis of Patients' Satisfaction."", 'Abiraterone acetate after progression with enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-center retrospective analysis.', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Body composition parameters were associated with response to abiraterone acetate and prognosis in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'mCRPC patients with PSA fluctuations under radioligand therapy have comparable survival benefits relative to patients with sustained PSA decrease.', 'The prognostic potential of alkaline phosphatase and lactic acid dehydrogenase in bmCRPC patients without significant PSA response under enzalutamide.', 'Early PSA Change after 177LuPSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy as a Predicator of Biochemical Response and Overall Survival.', 'ALP bouncing and LDH normalization in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients under therapy with Enzalutamide: an exploratory analysis.']"""

Methods:   From the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's (NSQIP) 2005-2013 database, we identified patients who underwent prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer. The cohort was stratified into current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. Bivariable and multivariable analysis was utilized to assess the association between smoking status and risk of complications.  Results:   We identified 22,802 patients who underwent malignancy-related prostatectomy and met inclusion criteria. Based on reported smoking history, 2799 (12.3%) were current smokers, 1879 (8.2%) were former smokers, and 18,124 (79.5%) were never smokers. Current smokers had a higher rate of total complications (5.7%) in comparison with former (4.8%) and never smokers (4.6%; P = .050). Postoperative pneumonia was more frequent in current smokers (0.4%) compared with former smokers (0.2%) and never smokers (0.2%; P = .039). Unplanned intubation occurred more frequently in current smokers (0.4%) when compared with former smokers (0.3%) and never smokers (0.1%; P = .002).

Methods:   Salvage ePLND was performed in a cohort of 54 patients with PCa recurrence, and data from 45 patients were analyzed. The indications for salvage ePLND were biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa and suspect findings on (11)C-choline PET/CT. PSA-level, biochemical response (BR), duration of biochemical recurrence freedom (BCRF), number of metastases, OS and CSS were analyzed retrospectively.  Results:   The average follow-up was 42.7 Â± 20.8 months. Thirty-three patients (73.3 %, 95 % CI: 60.5-83.6 %) achieved BCRF during follow-up. The mean BCRF-period was 31.4 Â± 19.7 months.

Although ionizing radiation is used to treat localized and metastatic prostate cancer, the most efficient use of radiotherapy is yet to be defined. Our purpose was to determine in vitro the potential benefit to be gained by combining radiation treatment with cytotoxic drugs.  Materials and methods:   Inhibitors of DNA repair and heat shock protein 90 and an inducer of oxidative stress were evaluated in combination with X-radiation for their capacity to reduce clonogenic survival and delay the growth of multicellular tumor spheroids.  Results:   Inhibitors of the PARP DNA repair pathway, olaparib and rucaparib, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, enhanced the clonogenic cell kill and spheroid growth delay induced by X-radiation. However, the oxidative stress-inducing drug elesclomol failed to potentiate the effects of X-radiation. PARP inhibitors arrested cells in the G2/M phase when administered as single agents or in combination with radiation, whereas elesclomol and 17-DMAG did not affect radiation-induced cell cycle modulation.

This paper aimed to clarify the synergistic effect of radiotherapy combined with the bladder cancer tissue-specific oncolytic adenovirus (Ad-PSCAE-UPII-E1A) on bladder cancer cells and to study the underlying synergy mechanisms of the combined treatment.  Materials and methods:   The Adenovirus carrying E1A under control of UPII promoter and prostate stem cell antigen enhancer (PSCAE) were successfully constructed. The viability of bladder cancer cells BIU-87 and EJ was determined by MTT assay. The apoptotic assay was demonstrated by flow cytometry and TEM. Virus titer was determined by TCID50 assay, and proteins Mre11, Chk2-Thr68, and E1A were analyzed by Western blot method.  Results:   Oncolytic adenovirus combined with radiotherapy improved antitumor efficacy compared with the single treatment at a time and was X-ray dosage-dependent. When the adenovirus infection was scheduled at 24 h after irradiation, cancer cells had the lowest viability. Adenovirus and irradiation induced cell death through the caspase-3 related apoptotic pathway, and bladder cancer cells were arrested at the G1 (BIU-87) or S phase (EJ). Autophagic vacuoles were observed in bladder cancer cells treated with radiation and adenovirus. After irradiation, more virus particles were observed in the BIU-87 and EJ cells. However, by a TCID50 assay, there was no difference in virus titter between irradiated bladder cancer cells and unirradiated cells. The proteins Mre11, Chk2-Thr68 which involved in the DNA break repair pathway were decreased while Î³-H2AX-Ser139 increased; at the same time, the E1A gene and the hexon proteins of oncolytic adenovirus were increased after irradiation.

A retrospective comparison was performed to a contemporary cohort of 597 patients treated with external beam radiation therapy to a median dose of 75.3 Gy using a propensity score-matched analysis.  Results:   Median followup was 7.8 years. With brachytherapy, 51.6% had Gleason score 7 vs. 72.0% for external radiation (p < 0.001).

Objective:   To report perioperative, pathologic, and oncologic outcomes of robot-assisted salvage nodal dissection (RASND) in patients with nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively evaluated 16 patients affected by nodal recurrence following RP documented by positive positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan.  Surgical procedure:   Surgery was performed using DaVinci Si and Xi systems. A pelvic nodal dissection that included lymphatic stations overlying the external, internal, and common iliac vessels, the obturator fossa, and the presacral nodes was performed. In 13 (81.3%) patients a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection that included all nodal tissue located between the aortic bifurcation and the renal vessels was performed.  Measurements:   Perioperative outcomes consisted of operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications occurred within 30 d after surgery. Biochemical response (BR) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen level <0.2 ng/ml at 40 d after RASND.  Results and limitations:   Median operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 210min, 250ml, and 3.5 d. The median number of nodes removed was 16.5. Positive lymph nodes were detected in 11 (68.8%) patients. Overall, four (25.0%) and five (31.2%) patients experienced intraoperative and postoperative complications, respectively. Overall, one (6.3%) and four (25.0%) patients had Clavien I and II complications within 30 d after RASND, respectively. Overall, five (33.3%) patients experienced BR after surgery. Our study is limited by the small cohort of patients evaluated and by the follow-up duration.  Conclusions:   RASND represents a feasible procedure in patients with nodal recurrence after RP and provides acceptable short-term oncologic outcomes, where one out of three patients experience BR immediately after surgery. Long-term data are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

Although dysregulation of the Î²âcatenin/Tâcell factor (TCF) pathway has been previously reported in prostate cancer, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Frequently rearranged in advanced Tâcell lymphomasâ1 (FRAT1) functions as a positive regulator of the Î²âcatenin/TCF signaling pathway. However, to the best of our knowledge, the molecular association between FRAT1 and the Î²âcatenin/TCF pathway in prostate cancer has not been investigated. In the present study, FRAT1 expression was analyzed in normal prostate tissues and prostate adenocarcinoma samples using publicly available databases, a commercial tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry techniques. In addition, FRAT1 expression levels were altered by overexpression or RNA interferenceâmediated depletion in prostate cancer cells. The effects of FRAT1 expression on tumor growth were determined using cell growth curves in vitro and xenografts in nude mice in vivo. The effects of FRAT1 on Î²âcatenin/TCF activity were measured using the TOPFLASH reporter assay. FRAT1 was expressed exclusively in the nuclei of normal prostate basal cells, and nuclear FRAT1 was detected in 68% (40/59) of prostate adenocarcinoma samples. In addition, FRAT1 activated the TCF luciferase reporter gene promoter in prostate cancer cells, and was observed to promote the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, FRAT1 expression was sufficient to transform NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and lead to tumor formation in vivo. These results suggest that FRAT1 demonstrates oncogenic properties in prostate cancer, potentially by suppressing the inhibitory effect of nuclear glycogen synthase 3Î² against Î²âcatenin/TCF activity, thus activating the Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling pathway and promoting cell growth.""","""['Wei Zhang', 'Hua Xiong', 'Yanmei Zou', 'Sanpeng Xu', 'Lanping Quan', 'Xianglin Yuan', 'Ningzhi Xu', 'Yihua Wang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['FRAT1 overexpression leads to aberrant activation of beta-catenin/TCF pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'FRAT1 promotes the angiogenic properties of human glioblastoma cells via VEGFA.', 'Knockdown of FRAT1 inhibits hypoxia-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via suppression of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'MiR-182 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating Wnt/Î²-catenin signal pathway.', 'Notch signaling in the prostate: critical roles during development and in the hallmarks of prostate cancer biology.', 'Bioinformatics Studies Provide Insight into Possible Target and Mechanisms of Action of Nobiletin against Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

Methods:   Serum samples from treatment-naÃ¯ve men participating in a randomized phase 3 trial of ADT +/- chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed using multiplex assays for insulin and multiple other soluble factors. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify associations between individual factor levels and PFS.  Results:   Sixty six patients were evaluable (median age = 72 years; median prostate surface antigen [PSA] = 31.5 ng/mL; Caucasian = 86 %; Gleason score â¥8 = 77 %). In the univariable analysis, higher insulin (HR = 0.81 [0.67, 0.98] p = 0.03) and C-peptide (HR = 0.62 [0.39, 1.00]; p = 0.05) levels were associated with a longer PFS, while higher Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF; HR = 1.63 [1.06, 2.51] p = 0.03) and Osteopontin (OPN; HR = 1.56 [1.13, 2.15]; p = 0.01) levels were associated with a shorter PFS.

The UKCTOCS screening trial failed to show a statistically significant mortality reduction in the primary analysis but reported an apparent increased mortality benefit in trial years 7-14 compared to 0-7. Here we report an updated analysis of PLCO with extended mortality follow-up.  Methods:   Participants were randomized from 1993 to 2001 at ten U.S. centers to an intervention or usual care arm. Intervention arm women were screened for ovarian cancer with annual trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVU) (4years) and CA-125 (6years), with a fixed cutoff at 35U/mL for CA-125. The original follow-up period was for up to 13years (median follow-up 12.4years); in this analysis follow-up for mortality was extended by up to 6years.  Results:   39,105 (intervention) and 39,111 (usual care) women were randomized, of which 34,253 and 34,304, respectively, had at least one ovary at baseline. Median follow-up was 14.7years in each arm and maximum follow-up 19.2years in each arm. A total of 187 (intervention) and 176 (usual care) deaths from ovarian cancer were observed, for a risk-ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87-1.30).

The proprietary compound galeterone (gal) was designed to inhibit proliferation of androgen/androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell in vitro and in vivo and is currently in phase III clinical development. Additionally, clinical studies with gal revealed its superb efficacy in four different cohorts of patients with mCRPC, including those expressing splice variant AR-V7. Preclinical studies with gal show that it also exhibits strong antiproliferative activities against AR-negative prostate cancer cells and tumors through a mechanism involving phosphorylation of eIF2Î±, which forms an integral component of the eukaryotic mRNA translation complex. Thus, we hypothesized that gal and its new analog, VNPT55, could modulate oncogenic mRNA translation and prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. We report that gal and VNPT55 profoundly inhibit migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, possibly by down-regulating protein expression of several EMT markers (Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, vimentin, and MMP-2/-9) via antagonizing the Mnk-eIF4E axis. In addition, gal/VNPT55 inhibited both NF-ÎºB and Twist1 transcriptional activities, down-regulating Snail and BMI-1 mRNA expression, respectively. Furthermore, profound up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression may explain the observed significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, expression of self-renewal proteins, Î²-catenin, CD44, and Nanog, was markedly depleted.

Mutations in tumor suppressor genes and in oncogenes are important for PCa progression, whereas the role of stem cell proteins in prostate carcinogenesis is insufficiently examined. This study investigates the role of the transcriptional regulator Ecotropic Viral Integration site 1 (EVI1), known as an essential modulator of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell biology, in prostate carcinogenesis. We show that in healthy prostatic tissue, EVI1 expression is confined to the prostate stem cell compartment located at the basal layer, as identified by the stem cell marker CD44. Instead, in a PCa progression cohort comprising 219 samples from patients with primary PCa, lymph node and distant metastases, EVI1 protein was heterogeneously distributed within samples and high expression is associated with tumor progression (P<0.001), suggesting EVI1 induction as a driver event. Functionally, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of EVI1 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle progression, migratory capacity and anchorage-independent growth of human PCa cells, while enhancing their apoptosis sensitivity. Interestingly, modulation of EVI1 expression also strongly regulated stem cell properties (including expression of the stem cell marker SOX2) and in vivo tumor initiation capacity. Further emphasizing a functional correlation between EVI1 induction and tumor progression, upregulation of EVI1 expression was noted in experimentally derived docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Importantly, knockdown of EVI1 in these cells restored sensitivity to docetaxel, in part by downregulating anti-apoptotic BCL2. Together, these data indicate EVI1 as a novel molecular regulator of PCa progression and therapy resistance that may control prostate carcinogenesis at the stem cell level.""","""['A Queisser', 'S Hagedorn', 'H Wang', 'T Schaefer', 'M Konantz', 'S Alavi', 'M Deng', 'W Vogel', 'A von MÃ¤ssenhausen', 'G Kristiansen', 'S Duensing', 'J Kirfel', 'C Lengerke', 'S Perner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Functional features of EVI1 and EVI1Î324 isoforms of MECOM gene in genome-wide transcription regulation and oncogenicity.', 'EVI1 promotes tumor growth via transcriptional repression of MS4A3.', 'The oncogene EVI1 enhances transcriptional and biological responses of human myeloid cells to all-trans retinoic acid.', 'The role of EVI1 in normal and leukemic cells.', 'EVI1 and its role in myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid leukemia and other malignant diseases.', 'Prognostic impact of the loss of E-cadherin and de novo expression of N-cadherin at the invasive front of primary and recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'TRIM24 Expression as an Independent Biomarker for Prognosis and Tumor Recurrence in HNSCC.', 'CRISPR-mediated MECOM depletion retards tumor growth by reducing cancer stem cell properties in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'EVI1 Promotes the Proliferation and Invasive Properties of Human Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.', 'Comparison of manual and automated digital image analysis systems for quantification of cellular protein expression.']"""

We previously identified LARP4 in an RNAi screen as one of several genes that regulate the shape of PC3 prostate cancer cells. Here we show that LARP4 depletion induces cell elongation in PC3 cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. LARP4 depletion increases cell migration and invasion, as well as inducing invasive cell protrusions in 3D Matrigel. Conversely, LARP4 over-expression reduces cell elongation and increases cell circularity. LARP4 mutations are found in a variety of cancers. Introduction of some of these cancer-associated mutations, including a truncation mutant, into LARP4 enhances its effects on cell morphology.

The signatures of mutations arising in human tissues following in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation have not been documented. Here, we searched for signatures of ionizing radiation in 12 radiation-associated second malignancies of different tumour types. Two signatures of somatic mutation characterize ionizing radiation exposure irrespective of tumour type. Compared with 319 radiation-naive tumours, radiation-associated tumours carry a median extra 201 deletions genome-wide, sized 1-100 base pairs often with microhomology at the junction. Unlike deletions of radiation-naive tumours, these show no variation in density across the genome or correlation with sequence context, replication timing or chromatin structure. Furthermore, we observe a significant increase in balanced inversions in radiation-associated tumours. Both small deletions and inversions generate driver mutations.

Our objective was to determine whether minimally invasive radical prostatectomy is associated with an increased risk of small bowel obstruction compared with open radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   In the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we identified 14,147 men found to have prostate cancer from 2000 to 2008 treated by open (n = 10,954) or minimally invasive (n = 3193) radical prostatectomy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the impact of surgical approach on the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, as well as the need for lysis of adhesions and exploratory laparotomy.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 45 and 76 months, respectively, the cumulative incidence of small bowel obstruction was 3.7% for minimally invasive and 5.3% for open radical prostatectomy (p = 0.0005). Lysis of adhesions occurred in 1.1% of minimally invasive and 2.0% of open prostatectomy patients (p = 0.0003). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant difference between minimally invasive and open prostatectomy with respect to small bowel obstruction (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.90, 1.52, p = 0.25) or lysis of adhesions (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50, 1.40, p = 0.57).

Methods:   We enrolled 227 men with treatment-naive prostate cancer and bone metastasis.

We aimed to determine the optimal definition of early salvage radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a multi-institutional retrospective study of 657 men who underwent salvage radiotherapy between 1986 and 2013. Two comparisons were made to determine the optimal definition of early salvage radiotherapy, including 1) the time from radical prostatectomy to salvage radiotherapy (less than 9, 9 to 21, 22 to 47 or greater than 48 months) and 2) the level of detectable pre-salvage radiotherapy prostate specific antigen (0.01 to 0.2, greater than 0.2 to 0.5 or greater than 0.5 ng/ml). Outcomes included freedom from salvage androgen deprivation therapy, and biochemical relapse-free, distant metastases-free and prostate cancer specific survival.  Results:   Median followup was 9.8 years. Time from radical prostatectomy to salvage radiotherapy did not correlate with 10-year biochemical relapse-free survival rates (R2 = 0.18). Increasing pre-salvage radiotherapy prostate specific antigen strongly correlated with biochemical relapse-free survival (R2 = 0.91). Increasing detectable pre-salvage radiotherapy prostate specific antigen (0.01 to 0.2, greater than 0.2 to 0.5 and greater than 0.5 ng/ml) predicted worse 10-year biochemical relapse-free survival (62%, 44% and 27%), freedom from salvage androgen deprivation therapy (77%, 66% and 49%), distant metastases-free survival (86%, 79% and 66%, each p <0.001) and prostate cancer specific survival (93%, 89% and 80%, respectively, p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis early salvage radiotherapy (prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 to 0.5 ng/ml) was associated with a twofold increase in biochemical failure, use of salvage androgen deprivation therapy and distant metastases compared to very early salvage radiotherapy (prostate specific antigen 0.01 to 0.2 ng/ml).  Conclusions:   The duration from radical prostatectomy to salvage radiotherapy is not independently prognostic for outcomes after salvage radiotherapy and it should not be used to define early salvage radiotherapy.

Radium-223 prolongs overall survival in these patients but may cause myelosuppression; understanding risk factors will improve clinical decision making. We describe hematologic safety of radium-223 in ALSYMPCA and post hoc analyses identifying patients at increased risk for hematologic toxicity.  Patients and methods:   Hematologic parameters and adverse events were analyzed. Multivariate analyses assessing baseline risk factors for hematologic toxicities were performed separately for radium-223 and placebo patients.  Results:   Nine hundred one patients received radium-223 (n = 600) or placebo (n = 301); 65% of radium-223 and 48% of placebo patients had the full 6 cycles. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was more common in radium-223 versus placebo patients (6% vs. 2%). Logistic regression analyses identified significant baseline predictors for grade 2-4 hematologic toxicities related to radium-223 treatment: extent of disease (6-20 vs. < 6 bone metastases; odds ratio [OR] = 2.76; P = .022) and elevated prostate-specific antigen (OR = 1.65; P = .006) for anemia; prior docetaxel (OR = 2.16; P = .035), decreased hemoglobin (OR = 1.35; P = .008), and decreased platelets (OR = 1.44; P = .030) for thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia events were too few in placebo patients for a comparative analysis.

This study estimated PCa risk among users of warfarin and other anticoagulants.  Materials and methods:   All anticoagulant use among 78,615 men during 1995-2009 was analyzed. Cox regression, adjusted for age, screening trial arm and use of other medications, with medication use as a time-dependent variable, was used to estimate PCa risk overall, and by tumor grade and stage.  Results:   In total, 6537 men were diagnosed with PCa during 1995-2009 (1210 among warfarin users). Compared to non-users, warfarin use was associated with an increased risk of PCa [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.22]. This was limited to short-term, low-dose use, and was not observed in long-term use. A similar overall risk increase was observed for Gleason grade 7-10 PCa. Low-dose, short-term use of warfarin was associated with an increased risk of metastatic PCa. However, the increase in risk vanished with continued use. Compared to other anticoagulants, low-dose use of warfarin was associated with a slightly elevated overall PCa risk (HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.43). The increase in risk disappeared in long-term, high-dose use.  Conclusions:   This study, which included a larger number of PCa cases with warfarin exposure than previous studies, does not support previous notions of decreased risk of PCa among warfarin users. A similar risk of PCa was found among warfarin users and the general population, and no difference in risk was found between warfarin and other anticoagulants.""","""['Pete T T Kinnunen', 'Teemu J Murtola', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer-specific survival among warfarin users in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Antidiabetic drug use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Serum cholesterol and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Anticoagulants and cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'The impact of warfarin on overall survival in cancer patients.', 'Association of Vitamin K and Non-Vitamin K Oral Anticoagulant Use and Cancer Incidence in Atrial Fibrillation Patients.', 'Pharmacoepidemiological Evaluation in Prostate Cancer-Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them.', 'Use of Warfarin or Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Risk of Prostate Cancer in PCBaSe: A Nationwide Case-Control Study.', 'Platelets and Metastasis: New Implications of an Old Interplay.']"""

We detected â¼144k putative regulatory regions among the human cell-lines, with the majority of them being â¼300 bp. We found â¼20k putative regulatory elements in the ENCODE heterochromatic domains suggesting a large regulatory potential in the regions presumed transcriptionally silent. Among the most significant TF interactions identified in the heterochromatic regions were CTCF and the cohesin complex, which is in agreement with previous reports. Finally, we investigated the enrichment of the obtained putative regulatory regions in the 3D chromatin domains. More than 90% of the regions were discovered in the 3D contacting domains. We found a significant enrichment of GWAS SNPs in the putative regulatory regions.

Few have focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women.  Methods:   Longitudinal data were collected from a cohort of HIV-positive Kenyan female sex workers. At enrollment and annual visits, participants were asked about past-year alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The primary endpoint was detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in vaginal secretions at quarterly examinations. Associations between hazardous/harmful alcohol use (AUDIT score â¥7), PSA detection, and secondary measures of sexual risk were evaluated using generalized estimating equations with a log binomial regression model.  Results:   A total of 405 women contributed 2750 vaginal samples over 606 person-years of follow-up. Hazardous/harmful alcohol use was reported at 16.6% of AUDIT assessments and was associated with higher risk of PSA detection (relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.01) relative to no alcohol use. This association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant, after adjusting for age, work venue, intimate partner violence, depression, and partnership status (adjusted relative risk, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.56). In exploratory analyses, alcohol use was associated with self-report of unprotected sex and with sexually transmitted infection acquisition.

A previously validated upgrading nomogram generates a score that predicts risk of biopsy Gleason 6 upgrading following radical prostatectomy in lower-risk populations that are candidates for Active Surveillance (Cancer, 2013).  Objectives:   We hypothesize that the upgrading risk (UR) score generated by this nomogram at diagnosis improves the ability to predict patients that will subsequently fail AS.  Methods:   To evaluate the nomogram, retrospective data from several institutional cohorts of patients who met AS criteria, group 1 (n = 75) and group 2 (n = 1230), were independently examined. A UR score was generated using the coefficients from the nomogram consisting of PSA density (PSAD), BMI, maximum % core involvement (MCI), and number of positive cores. AS failure was defined as Gleason score (GS) >6, >50 % maximum core involvement, or >2 positive cores on biopsy. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models, upgrading risk score, and other clinicopathologic features were each assessed for their ability to predict AS failure.  Results:   Clinicopathologic parameters were similar in both groups with the exception of mean PSAD (0.13 vs. 0.11, p < 0.01) and follow-up (2.1 vs. 3.2 years, p = 0.2). Most common cause of AS failure was GS > 6 (group 1) compared to >2 positive cores (group 2). On univariate analysis in both populations, features at diagnosis including PSAD and the UR score were significant in predicting AS failure by upgrading (Gleason > 6) and any failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the UR score predicts AS failure by GS upgrading (HR 1.8, 95 % CI 1.12-2.93; p = 0.01) and any failure criteria (HR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.06-2.65); p = 0.02) for group 1. Likewise, the UR score in group 2 predicts AS failure with GS upgrading (HR 1.3, 95 % CI 1.15-1.42; p < 0.0001) and any failure criteria (HR 1.18, 95 % CI 1.18-1.38; p < 0.0001). An ROC generated an AUC of 0.66. Decision curve analysis demonstrated a high net benefit for the UR score across a range of threshold probabilities. Based on these outcomes, at 3 years, patients in the lowest risk quartile have a 15 % risk of AS failure versus a 46 % risk in the highest quartile (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The UR score was predictive of pathologic AS failure on multivariate analysis in several AS cohorts. It outperformed single clinicopathologic criteria and may provide a useful adjunct using clinicopathologic data to stratify patients considering AS.""","""['M L Blute Jr', 'J M Shiau', 'M Truong', 'Fangfang Shi', 'E J Abel', 'T M Downs', 'D F Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Development and multi-institutional validation of an upgrading risk tool for Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen vs prostate-specific antigen density as a predictor of upgrading in men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer by contemporary multicore prostate biopsy.', 'Limitations in Predicting Organ Confined Prostate Cancer in Patients with Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Active surveillance: patient selection.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer: when to recommend delayed intervention.', 'miR-145-5p: A Potential Biomarker in Predicting Gleason Upgrading of Prostate Biopsy Samples Scored 3+3=6.', 'Risk of adverse pathological features for intermediate risk prostate cancer: Clinical implications for definitive radiation therapy.', 'Nomograms in Urologic Oncology: Lights and Shadows.', 'Prostate Biopsy in Active Surveillance Protocols: Immediate Re-biopsy and Timing of Subsequent Biopsies.']"""

Cancer risk was estimated by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) in the early (4-27 months after HIV registration), late (28-60 months), and overall (4-60 months) incidence periods. Cancers diagnosed prior to or within 3 months of HIV registration were considered prevalent.Of 613 linked cancers to PLHIV, 188 were prevalent, 106 early incident, and 319 late incident. Incident cancers comprised 11.5% AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs), including cervical cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but not Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and 88.5% non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). Risk for any incident cancer diagnosis in early, late, and combined periods was significantly elevated among PLHIV (SIRs: 5.6 [95% CI 4.6-6.8], 17.7 [95% CI 15.8-19.8], and 11.5 [95% CI 10-12.6], respectively). Cervical cancer risk was elevated in both incidence periods (SIRs: 9.6 [95% CI 4.8-17.2] and 22.6 [95% CI 14.3-33.9], respectively), while NHL risk was elevated only in the late incidence period (SIR: 18.0 [95% CI 9.8-30.20]). Risks for NADCs were dramatically elevated (SIR > 100) for eye-orbit, substantially (SIR > 20) for all-mouth, esophagus, breast, unspecified-leukemia, colon-rectum-anus, and other/unspecified cancers; moderately elevated (SIR > 10) for salivary gland, penis, nasopharynx, and brain-nervous system, and mildly elevated (SIR > 5) for stomach. Risks for 6 NADCs (small intestine, testis, lymphocytic leukemia, prostate, ovary, and melanoma) were not elevated and 5 cancers, including multiple myeloma not seen.Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using probabilistic record-linkage to study cancer/other comorbidities among PLHIV in India and provides preliminary population-based estimates of cancer risks in PLHIV in India.

In this scenario, men with persistently elevated PSA values may have considerable psychological distress. We attempted to determine whether elevated PSA values have psychological effects on these men in association with the timing of measurement, PSA kinetics, and biopsy results.  Methods:   In order to investigate the initial and late effects of PSA tests on psychological distress during serial measurements, two groups of men with screen-positive results (PSA â¥3 ng/ml) were studied-205 men whose first questionnaires regarding anxiety and depression were taken at initial screening (group A), and 103 men whose questionnaires were taken at repeated measurement for prior PSA elevation (group B).  Results:   The level of distress was generally low. There were no significant differences in distress between the two groups, suggesting a constant psychological effect by elevated PSA values over a long period of time. The distress of men in group A increased significantly as PSA levels rose and decreased when they fell to normal range. On the other hand, the distress of men in group B did not change regardless of PSA kinetics, indicating that their psychological condition seemed susceptible to subtle PSA change only in the initial phase of measurements. Unexpectedly, men with benign results showed insignificant but higher distress after prostate biopsy.  Conclusions:   Although a small fraction of men have psychological distress caused by changes in PSA levels, the benefits, risks (psychological and physical), and limitations of PSA tests must be adequately explained to the patients before entering the screening program.""","""['Minoru Kobayashi', 'Akinori Nukui', 'Takao Kamai']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Measuring the psychosocial impact of population-based prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer in the UK.', 'Psychological distress and prostate specific antigen levels in men with and without prostate cancer.', 'Anxiety associated with prostate cancer screening with special reference to men with a positive screening test (elevated PSA) - Results from a prospective, population-based, randomised study.', 'Psychological aspects of PSA testing.', 'Depression and anxiety in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics contributes to decision making for biopsy referral: the predictive implication for PSA retest in patients with elevated PSA levels.', ""'Is it painful'?

Patients and methods:   This retrospective study reviewed data of a subset of 55 consecutive patients among 1,060 patients who underwent RARP for preoperative suspicion of prostate cancer. Pathological characteristics and outcomes of patients with suspected prostate cancer were analyzed and preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters were compared between three groups. Patients were stratified by final pathology reports of RARP specimens: Group I: Prostate cancer, N=22 (40%); group II: abnormal (prostate intraepithelial neoplasia; atypical small acinar proliferation), N=18 (32.7%); and group III: benign (nodular hyperplasia or inflammation), N=15 (27.3%).  Results:   Mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 16.04Â±2.21 ng/ml. Twenty-two patients with adenocarcinoma had pathology stage pT2a/T2b/ T2c/T3a/T3b (6/7/2/6/1 patients, respectively), with positive surgical margins in 18.2% (4/22).

A total of 246 consecutive patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer (117 SBx and 129 TBx diagnoses) who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between January 2014 and December 2015, were enrolled. The concordance of biopsy GS to pathological GS, as well as the association between categorical variables [age, digital rectal exam (DRE), TNM, PI-RADS], were analyzed by Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 32.0% of the SBx group and in 49.3% of TBx. The rate of correctly classified, up-graded and down-graded GS was 53.8% vs. 91.5%, 39.3% vs. 7.8% and 6.8% vs. 0.8% for SBx and TBx, respectively (p<0.001).

However, Bco1 disruption also impacts diverse physiological end points independent of dietary carotenoid feeding, including expression of genes controlling androgen metabolism. Using the Bco1-/- mouse model, we sought to probe the effects of Bco1 disruption on testicular steroidogenesis, prostatic androgen signaling, and prostatic proliferation. Male wild-type (WT) and Bco1-/- mice were raised on carotenoid-free AIN-93G diets before euthanasia between 10 and 14 wk of age. Weights of the prostate and seminal vesicles were significantly lower in Bco1-/- than in WT mice (-18% and -29%, respectively). Serum testosterone levels in Bco1-/- mice were significantly reduced by 73%. Bco1 disruption significantly reduced Leydig cell number and decreased testicular mRNA expression of Hsd17b3, suggesting inhibition of testicular testosterone synthesis. Immunofluorescent staining of the androgen receptor (AR) in the dorsolateral prostate lobes of Bco1-/- mice revealed a decrease in AR nuclear localization. Analysis of prostatic morphology suggested decreases in gland size and secretion. These findings were supported by reduced expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in Bco1-/- prostates. Expression analysis of 200 prostate cancer- and androgen-related genes suggested that Bco1 loss significantly disrupted prostatic androgen receptor signaling, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. This is the first demonstration that Bco1 disruption lowers murine circulating testosterone levels and thereby reduces prostatic androgen receptor signaling and prostatic cellular proliferation, further supporting the role of this protein in processes more diverse than carotenoid cleavage.""","""['Joshua W Smith', 'Nikki A Ford', 'Jennifer M Thomas-Ahner', 'Nancy E Moran', 'Eric C Bolton', 'Matthew A Wallig', 'Steven K Clinton', 'John W Erdman Jr']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol""","""['Ablation of carotenoid cleavage enzymes (BCO1 and BCO2) induced hepatic steatosis by altering the farnesoid X receptor/miR-34a/sirtuin 1 pathway.', 'Î²-Carotene Oxygenase 1 Activity Modulates Circulating Cholesterol Concentrations in Mice and Humans.', 'Two carotenoid oxygenases contribute to mammalian provitamin A metabolism.', 'Enzymology of vertebrate carotenoid oxygenases.', 'Mammalian carotenoid-oxygenases: key players for carotenoid function and homeostasis.', 'Are We Sentenced to Pharmacotherapy?

Here, we established the DTX-resistant variants of human lung cancer A549 and androgen-independent prostate cancer Du145 cells and found that the resistance development provoked aberrant up-regulations of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B10 and AKR1C3 in A549 and Du145 cells, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity to the DTX toxicity was significantly decreased and increased by overexpression and knockdown of the two AKR isoforms, respectively. Furthermore, the resistant cells exhibited a decreased level of reactive 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal formed during DTX treatment, and the decrease was alleviated by adding the AKR inhibitors, inferring that the two AKRs confer the chemoresistance through elevating the antioxidant properties. The development of DTX resistance was also associated with enhanced expression of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 among the ABC transporter isoforms. The combined treatment with inhibitors of the two AKRs and ABCB1 additively sensitized the resistant cells to DTX. Intriguingly, the AKR1B10 inhibitor also suppressed the lung cancer cross-resistance against cisplatin. The results suggest that combined treatment with AKRs (1B10 and 1C3) and ABCB1 inhibitors exerts overcoming effect against the cancer resistance to DTX and cisplatin, and can be used as the adjuvant therapy.""","""['Toshiyuki Matsunaga', 'Haruhi Saito', 'Satoshi Endo', 'Kazuhiro Iguchi', 'Midori Soda', 'Ossama El-Kabbani', 'Akira Hara', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Free Radic Res""","""['Aldo-Keto Reductases and Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Availability of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 and ATP-binding cassette B1 as therapeutic targets for alleviating paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer MCF7 cells.', 'Significance of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 and ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 in gain of irinotecan resistance in colon cancer cells.', 'Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 promotes development of cisplatin resistance in gastrointestinal cancer cells through down-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³-dependent mechanism.', 'The roles of aldo-keto reductases in steroid hormone action.', 'Discovering novel mechanisms of taxane resistance in human breast cancer by whole-exome sequencing.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases and Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'The Role of AKR1B10 in Physiology and Pathophysiology.']"""

Methods:   The 1973-2011 surveillance, epidemiology and end results database was used to determine the observed and expected number of BlCa after PCa radiation. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) of developing BlCa were calculated for the various radiation modalities relative to no radiation, stratified by ethnicity and follow-up duration. BlCa characteristics were compared between patients with a history of prostate radiation and those without PCa.  Results:   PCa was radiated in 346,429 men, 6401 of whom developed BlCa versus 2464 expected cases [SIR (95 % CI) of 2.60 (2.53-2.66)]. All radiation modalities were found to have an increased RR of developing BlCa after 10 years, with brachytherapy having a significantly higher RR than external beam radiation (EBRT) or combined EBRT and brachytherapy in Caucasian men and a significantly higher RR than EBRT in men of other/unknown ethnicity. Post-radiation BlCa, in particular that after brachytherapy, had higher grade (P = 0.0001) and lower stage (P = 0.0001) versus the general population.  Conclusions:   The increased risk of BlCa after prostate radiation occurs predominantly after 10 years, regardless of ethnicity. The RR of developing BlCa after 10 years is significantly higher following brachytherapy than after EBRT or EBRT and brachytherapy.

These AR-related resistance mechanisms include AR gene amplification or overexpression, constitutively active ligand-independent AR splice variants, and gain-of-function mutations involving the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD), among others. Therefore, the development of AR-targeted therapies that function independently of the LBD represents an unmet medical need and has the potential to overcome many of these resistance mechanisms. This article discusses N-terminal domain (NTD) inhibition as a novel concept in the field of AR-directed therapies for prostate cancer. AR NTD-targeting agents have the potential to overcome shortcomings of current hormonal therapies by inhibiting all forms of AR-mediated transcriptional activity, and as a result, may affect a broader AR population including mutational and splice variant ARs. Indeed, the first clinical trial of an AR NTD inhibitor is now underway.  Implications for practice:   Because of emerging resistance mechanisms that involve the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR), there is currently no effective treatment addressing tumor escape mechanisms related to current AR-targeted therapies. Many patients still demonstrate limited clinical response to current hormonal agents, and castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a lethal disease. Intense research efforts are under way to develop therapies to target resistance mechanisms, including those directed at other parts of the AR molecule. A novel small-molecule agent, EPI-506, represents a new pharmaceutical class, AR N-terminal domain inhibitors, and shows preclinical promise to overcome many known resistance mechanisms related to novel hormonal therapies.""","""['Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Chandtip Chandhasin', 'Erica Osbourne', 'Jun Luo', 'Marianne D Sadar', 'Frank Perabo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'An androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist for treating prostate cancer.', 'Cheminformatic Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling to Investigate Androgen Receptor Antagonists to Combat Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Constitutively Active Androgen Receptor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Hybrid Androgen Receptor Inhibitors Outperform Enzalutamide and EPI-001 in in\u2005vitro Models of Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance.']"""

Subjects and methods:   We retrospectively analysed a prospective longitudinal cohort database including a single-surgeon series of 507 consecutive men treated with external beam radiotherapy and an HDR prostate brachytherapy boost between August 2000 and December 2009. The risk factors used were based on the D'Amico classification. We measured the incidence of no biochemical evidence of disease (bNED) based on the Phoenix definition of failure (nadir PSA + 2 ng/mL). We also reviewed the incidence of urethral stricture in this cohort.  Results:   With minimum and median follow-ups of 6 and 10.3 years, respectively, the bNED rates for men with intermediate- and high risk disease were 93.3% and 74.2%, respectively, at 5 years and 86.9% and 56.1%, respectively, at 10 years. The 10-year bNED rate for men with only one intermediate-risk factor was 94%, whereas for patients with all three high-risk factors it was 39.5%. The overall urethral stricture rate was 13.6%. Before 2005, the urethral stricture rate was 28.9% and after January 2005 it was 4.2%. For the 271 men with a minimum follow-up of 10 years the actuarial 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was 90.8% and the actuarial overall survival rate was 86.7%.  Conclusions:   For men with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer features, who are considered not suitable for, or wish to avoid a radical prostatectomy, HDR prostate brachytherapy remains an appropriate treatment option.

In this study, we used LNCaP prostate cancer cells cultured in a serum-free medium for 6 days as a NE model of prostate cancer. Serum deprivation increased the expression of NE markers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Î²III tubulin (Î²III tub) and decreased the expression of the androgen receptor protein in LNCaP cells. Using cDNA microarrays, we compared gene expression profiles of NE cells and non-differentiated LNCaP cells. We identified up-regulation of 155 genes, among them LAMP2, a lysosomal membrane protein involved in lysosomal stability and autophagy. We then confirmed up-regulation of LAMP2 in NE cells by qRT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscopy assays, showing that mRNA up-regulation correlated with increased levels of LAMP2 protein. Subsequently, we determined autophagy activity in NE cells by assessing the protein levels of SQSTM/p62 and LC3 by Western blot and LC3 and Atg5 mRNAs content by qRT-PCR. The decreased levels of SQSTM/p62 was accompanied by an enhanced expression of LC3 and ATG5, suggesting activation of autophagy in NE cells. Blockage of autophagy with 1Î¼M AKT inhibitor IV, or by silencing Beclin 1 and Atg5, prevented NE cell differentiation, as revealed by decreased levels of the NE markers. In addition, AKT inhibitor IV as well as Beclin1 and Atg5 kwockdown attenuated LAMP2 expression in NE cells.

The key drivers regulated a set of common effectors including genes preferentially expressed in neuronal cells. NLGN4Y-a protein involved in synaptic adhesion in neurons-was ranked as the top gene closely linked to key drivers of myogenesis subnetworks. Lower expression of NLGN4Y was associated with higher grade PCa and an increased risk of BCR. We show that restoration of the protein expression of NLGN4Y in PC-3 cells leads to decreased cell proliferation, migration and inflammatory cytokine expression.

Natural Killer (NK) cells are the first line of defense against cancer and infections. NK cell function is regulated by a delicate balance between signals received through activating and inhibitory receptors. Previously, we identified Lectin-like transcript-1 (LLT1/OCIL/CLEC2D) as a counter-receptor for the NK cell inhibitory receptor NKRP1A (CD161). Interaction of LLT1 expressed on target cells with NKRP1A inhibits NK cell activation. In this study, we have found that LLT1 was overexpressed on prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC3) and in primary prostate cancer tissues both at the mRNA and protein level. We further showed that LLT1 is retained intracellularly in normal prostate cells with minimal cell surface expression. Blocking LLT1 interaction with NKRP1A by anti-LLT1 mAb on prostate cancer cells increased the NK-mediated cytotoxicity of prostate cancer cells. The results indicate that prostate cancer cells may evade immune attack by NK cells by expressing LLT1 to inhibit NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity through LLT1-NKRP1A interaction.

KDM4A associates with E2F1 on target gene promoters and enhances E2F1 chromatin binding and transcriptional activity, thereby modulating the transcriptional profile essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival. The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) PDK1 and PDK3 are direct targets of KDM4A and E2F1 and modulate the switch between glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial oxidation. Downregulation of KDM4A leads to elevated activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial oxidation, resulting in excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The altered metabolic phenotypes can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of PDK1 and PDK3, indicating a KDM4A-dependent tumor metabolic regulation via PDK.

Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database were extracted on the basis of the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Among these patients, 284 post-transplant malignancies were diagnosed. These included 99 de novo malignancies among 98 patients, yielding a standardized incidence ratio of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.76 to 2.64) compared to the general population. The most common malignancies were infection related liver cancer (19.39%), oropharyngeal cancer (19.39%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (9.18%), and esophageal cancer (5.10%), as well as non-infection-related prostate cancer (6.12%). Patients with recurrent malignancies had the highest mortality. Furthermore, 186 recurrent malignancies relapsed, and the commonly affected organs were the liver (83.33%), lung (4.84%), bone and bone marrow (4.30%), and intrahepatic bile ducts (2.69%). Old age, the male sex, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B, peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus, and pre-existing cancer were all risk factors associated with post-transplant malignancies. Recipients with biliary atresia or urea cycle metabolism disorders were protected from post-transplant malignancies.

In this study, efficacy and toxicity of Rhizochalinin (Rhiz) - a novel sphingolipid-like marine compound - was evaluated in prostate cancer models, resistant to currently approved standard therapies. In vitro activity and mechanism of action of Rhiz were examined in the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, 22Rv1, and VCaP. Rhiz significantly reduced cell viability at low micromolar concentrations showing most pronounced effects in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistant AR-V7 positive cells. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, inhibition of pro-survival autophagy, downregulation of AR-V7, PSA and IGF-1 expression as well as inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channels were identified as mechanisms of action. Remarkably, Rhiz re-sensitized AR-V7 positive cells to enzalutamide and increased efficacy of taxanes.In vivo activity and toxicity were evaluated in PC-3 and 22Rv1 NOD SCID mouse xenograft models using i.p. administration. Rhiz significantly reduced growth of PC-3 and 22Rv1 tumor xenografts by 27.0% (p = 0.0156) and 46.8% (p = 0.047) compared with controls with an increased fraction of tumor cells showing apoptosis secondary to Rhiz exposure. In line with the in vitro data, Rhiz was most active in AR-V7 positive xenografts in vivo. In animals, no severe side effects were observed.In conclusion, Rhiz is a promising novel marine-derived compound characterized by a unique combination of anticancer properties.

We investigated the effects of active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, and radical radiotherapy with hormones on patient-reported outcomes.  Methods:   We compared patient-reported outcomes among 1643 men in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial who completed questionnaires before diagnosis, at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and annually thereafter. Patients completed validated measures that assessed urinary, bowel, and sexual function and specific effects on quality of life, anxiety and depression, and general health. Cancer-related quality of life was assessed at 5 years. Complete 6-year data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.  Results:   The rate of questionnaire completion during follow-up was higher than 85% for most measures. Of the three treatments, prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence, and although there was some recovery, these outcomes remained worse in the prostatectomy group than in the other groups throughout the trial. The negative effect of radiotherapy on sexual function was greatest at 6 months, but sexual function then recovered somewhat and was stable thereafter; radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence. Sexual and urinary function declined gradually in the active-monitoring group. Bowel function was worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months than in the other groups but then recovered somewhat, except for the increasing frequency of bloody stools; bowel function was unchanged in the other groups. Urinary voiding and nocturia were worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months but then mostly recovered and were similar to the other groups after 12 months. Effects on quality of life mirrored the reported changes in function. No significant differences were observed among the groups in measures of anxiety, depression, or general health-related or cancer-related quality of life.  Conclusions:   In this analysis of patient-reported outcomes after treatment for localized prostate cancer, patterns of severity, recovery, and decline in urinary, bowel, and sexual function and associated quality of life differed among the three groups.

TRIM25 binds full-length ERG, and it also binds the N-terminally truncated variants of ERG that are expressed in tumors with TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. We demonstrate that TRIM25 polyubiquitinates ERG in vitro and that inactivation of TRIM25 resulted in reduced polyubiquitination and stabilization of ERG. TRIM25 mRNA and protein expression was increased in ERG rearrangement-positive prostate cancer specimens, and we provide evidence that ERG upregulates TRIM25 expression.

The primary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality at a median of 10 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the rates of disease progression, metastases, and all-cause deaths.  Results:   There were 17 prostate-cancer-specific deaths overall: 8 in the active-monitoring group (1.5 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 3.0), 5 in the surgery group (0.9 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.2), and 4 in the radiotherapy group (0.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.0); the difference among the groups was not significant (P=0.48 for the overall comparison). In addition, no significant difference was seen among the groups in the number of deaths from any cause (169 deaths overall; P=0.87 for the comparison among the three groups). Metastases developed in more men in the active-monitoring group (33 men; 6.3 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 4.5 to 8.8) than in the surgery group (13 men; 2.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.2) or the radiotherapy group (16 men; 3.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9) (P=0.004 for the overall comparison). Higher rates of disease progression were seen in the active-monitoring group (112 men; 22.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 19.0 to 27.5) than in the surgery group (46 men; 8.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 6.7 to 11.9) or the radiotherapy group (46 men; 9.0 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 6.7 to 12.0) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison).  Conclusions:   At a median of 10 years, prostate-cancer-specific mortality was low irrespective of the treatment assigned, with no significant difference among treatments. Surgery and radiotherapy were associated with lower incidences of disease progression and metastases than was active monitoring.

Recently, higher rates of cancer incidence were observed among myocardial infarction survivors compared with the general population. We examined the association between chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides, a proxy measure for traffic-related air pollution, and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients.  Methods:   Patients aged â¤65 years admitted to hospital in central Israel with a first myocardial infarction in 1992-1993 were followed to 2013 for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality. Data on sociodemographic and cancer risk factors were obtained, including time-varying information on smoking. Using land use regression models, annual averages of nitrogen oxides during follow-up were estimated individually according to home addresses. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to study the relationships with cancer outcomes.  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 16 (SD 7) years, 262 incident cancers and 105 cancer deaths were identified among 1393 cancer-free patients at baseline (mean age 54 years; 81% men). In adjusted models, a 10 ppb increase in mean nitrogen oxide exposure was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.18) for cancer incidence and HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93-1.26) for cancer mortality. The association with lung, bladder, kidney or prostate cancer (previously linked to air pollution) was stronger (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00-1.33).

In this study, we propose a powerful method, Subpathway-CorSP, for identifying metabolic subpathway regions. This method improved on original pathway identification methods by using a subpathway identification strategy and emphasizing expression correlations between metabolites and genes of interest based on topological features within the metabolic pathways. We analyzed a prostate cancer data set and its metastatic sub-group data set with detailed comparison of Subpathway-CorSP with four traditional pathway identification methods. Subpathway-CorSP was able to identify multiple subpathway regions whose entire corresponding pathways were not detected by traditional pathway identification methods. Further evidences indicated that Subpathway-CorSP provided a robust and efficient way of reliably recalling cancer-related subpathways and locating novel subpathways by the combined effect of metabolites and genes.

Previous work by our lab found novel compound disodium [(6Z,11E,15E)-9-[bis(sodiooxy)phosphoryl]-17-hydroxy-2,6,12,16-tetramethyheptadeca-2,6,11,15-tetraen-9-yl]phosphonate (GGOHBP), which inhibits the IBP enzyme geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS), reduced protein geranylgeranylation without altering protein farnesylation. This activity significantly reduced adrenal gland tumor burden in a murine model of human prostate cancer metastasis which relied on treatment of established disease. The present study determined the ability of GGDPS inhibition to slow the development of prostate cancer metastasis in a preventative murine model. Using tail vein injection of human derived PC-3 prostate cancer cells 4 d after initiating daily GGOHBP or vehicle treatments, we found GGOHBP significantly reduced whole body tumor burden, significantly slowed the development of tumors, and prolonged overall survival as compared to vehicle treated animals. The observed reduction in soft tissue tumor burden corresponded to a biochemical reduction in Rap1A geranylgeranylation, which for prostate cancer is important in its own merit and which serves as a surrogate marker for Rho family, i.e. Rac, protein modification. This effect was present in all treated mice pointing to strong target engagement, which was not observed in non-tumor burdened tissues or control mice.

Independent studies showed epigenetic silencing of SFRP3 in melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, a tumor suppressive function of SFRP3 was shown in androgen-independent prostate and gastric cancer cells. The current study is the first to investigate SFRP3 expression and its potential clinical impact on non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). WNT signaling components present on NSCLC subtypes were preliminary elucidated by expression data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified a distinct expression signature of relevant WNT signaling components that differ between adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Of interest, canonical WNT signaling is predominant in LUAD samples and non-canonical WNT signaling is predominant in LUSC. In line, high SFRP3 expression resulted in beneficial clinical outcome for LUAD but not for LUSC patients. Furthermore, SFRP3 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in NSCLC tissue compared to normal lung samples. TCGA data verified the reduction of SFRP3 in LUAD and LUSC patients. Moreover, DNA hypermethylation of SFRP3 was evaluated in the TCGA methylation dataset resulting in epigenetic inactivation of SFRP3 expression in LUAD, but not in LUSC, and was validated by pyrosequencing of our NSCLC tissue cohort and in vitro demethylation experiments. Immunohistochemistry confirmed SFRP3 protein downregulation in primary NSCLC and indicated abundant expression in normal lung tissue. Two adenocarcinoma gain-of-function models were used to analyze the functional impact of SFRP3 on cell proliferation and regulation of CyclinD1 expression in vitro.

We classified AREs according to their degeneracy and their transcriptional involvement. Additionally, we quantified ARE utilization in response to somatic copy number amplifications, AR splice-variants, and steroid treatment. Although imperfect AREs make up 99.9% of the motifs, the degree of degeneracy correlates negatively with validated transcriptional outcome. Weaker AREs, particularly ARE half sites, benefit from neighboring motifs or cooperating transcription factors in regulating gene expression.

Dosimetric data of 15 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who were treated with radiotherapy were analyzed. The prescribed dose was 78Gy in 39 fractions. Dosimetric analysis compared testicular doses generated by 7-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy with a single arc at 6, 10, and 15MV energy levels. Testicular doses calculated from the treatment planning system and doses measured from the detectors were analyzed. Mean testicular doses from the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy per fraction calculated in the treatment planning system were 16.3 Â± 10.3cGy vs 21.5 Â± 11.2cGy (p = 0.03) at 6MV, 13.4 Â± 10.4cGy vs 17.8 Â± 10.7cGy (p = 0.04) at 10MV, and 10.6 Â± 8.5cGy vs 14.5 Â± 8.6cGy (p = 0.03) at 15MV, respectively. Mean scattered testicular doses in the phantom measurements were 99.5 Â± 17.2cGy, 118.7 Â± 16.4cGy, and 193.9 Â± 14.5cGy at 6, 10, and 15MV, respectively, in the intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans.

Methods:   Patients with incident prostate cancer were enrolled in collaboration with the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry, with an oversampling of minority patients. Medical record abstraction was used to determine whether participants received high-quality care based on 5 standards: 1) discussion of all treatment options; 2) complete workup (prostate-specific antigen, Gleason grade, and clinical stage); 3) low-risk participants did not undergo a bone scan; 4) high-risk participants treated with radiotherapy (RT) received androgen deprivation therapy; and 5) participants treated with RT received conformal or intensity-modulated RT.

The replicative potential is a crucial factor in determining the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses. However, viral replication is attenuated by the low-activity promoter that we used, thus compromising viral cytotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the effect of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Waf-1 on an adenovirus. We used lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA to knock down p21/Waf-1 in two bladder cancer cell lines EJ and 5637. The p21/Waf-1 knockdown not only induced stronger cytopathic effects but also augmented apoptosis, which was closely associated with the enhancement of Fas and the subsequent significant activation of caspase-3. A replicative assay showed that p21/Waf-1 knockdown increased the viral particle production. Western blot analysis confirmed that p21/Waf-1 knockdown upregulated the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and two adenovirus replication indicators E1A and hexon. A luciferase activity assay indicated higher transcriptional activity of the uroplakin II (UPII) promoter in the p21/Waf-1 knockdown cells, and one possible mechanism could be that the increased expression of AR induced the UPII promoter through the AR-binding sites of the prostate stem cell antigen enhancer.

A cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention has been developed specifically for HFNS that is theoretically based and shown to reduce significantly the impact of HFNS in several randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Self-help CBT has been found to be as effective as group CBT for these symptoms, but these interventions are not widely available in the workplace. This paper describes the protocol of an RCT aiming to assess the efficacy of CBT for menopausal symptoms implemented in the workplace, with a nested qualitative study to examine acceptability and feasibility.  Methods/design:   One hundred menopausal working women, aged 45-60 years, experiencing bothersome HFNS for two months will be recruited from several (2-10) large organisations into a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Women will be randomly assigned to either treatment (a self-help CBT intervention lasting 4 weeks) or to a no treatment-wait control condition (NTWC), following a screening interview, consent, and completion of a baseline questionnaire. All participants will complete follow-up questionnaires at 6 weeks and 20 weeks post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the rating of HFNS; secondary measures include HFNS frequency, mood, quality of life, attitudes to menopause, HFNS beliefs and behaviours, work absence and presenteeism, job satisfaction, job stress, job performance, disclosure to managers and turnover intention. Adherence, acceptability and feasibility will be assessed at 20 weeks post-randomisation in questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Upon trial completion, the control group will also be offered the intervention.

In Italy, prostate cancer mortality has been dropping since 2000, but it is difficult to understand whether PSA testing is the main reason, considering the role of treatment in prognosis. The objectives of this study were: (1) to describe Italian trends of prostate cancer risk categories and corresponding changes in treatment patterns and (2) to interpret changes in survival over time.  Methods:   We made a retrospective observational study using population-based cancer registries. We examined two periods, 1996-1999 and 2005-2007, analysing the distribution of patients among risk groups and treatment changes in those intervals. We estimated 7- and 15-year relative survival with the cohort approach, Ederer II method. We analysed 4635 cases.  Results:   There was downward risk migration from the first to the second period. In patients younger than 75 years, there was an increase in radical prostatectomy but not radiotherapy; patients older than 75 years rarely had treatment with radical intent. We noted an improvement of prostate cancer survival in the high-risk group.  Conclusion:   These findings raise several questions: the possible overtreatment of low-risk patients undergoing radical treatment; the utility of more aggressive treatment for elderly patients with high-risk disease; and the importance of a multidisciplinary clinical approach to ensure multiple and alternative treatment options.

Methods:   Sixty-seven consecutive men with suspected prostate cancer underwent 1.5T mpMRI prior to template-mapping-biopsy (TPM). Twenty-six men had 'significant' TZ tumour. Two radiologists in consensus matched TPM to the single axial slice best depicting tumour, or largest TZ diameter for those with benign histology, to define single-slice whole TZ-regions-of-interest (ROIs). Textural-parameter differences between single-slice whole TZ-ROI containing significant tumour versus benign/insignificant tumour were analysed using Mann Whitney U test. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC-AUC) analysis cross-validated with leave-one-out (LOO) analysis.  Results:   ADC kurtosis was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in TZ containing significant tumour with ROC-AUC 0.80 (LOO-AUC 0.78); the difference became non-significant following exclusion of significant tumour from single-slice whole TZ-ROI (p = 0.23). T1-entropy was significantly lower (p = 0.004) in TZ containing significant tumour with ROC-AUC 0.70 (LOO-AUC 0.66) and was unaffected by excluding significant tumour from TZ-ROI (p = 0.004). Combining these parameters yielded ROC-AUC 0.86 (LOO-AUC 0.83).  Conclusion:   Textural features of the whole prostate TZ can discriminate significant prostatic cancer through reduced kurtosis of the ADC-histogram where significant tumour is included in TZ-ROI and reduced T1 entropy independent of tumour inclusion.

However, no study has investigated the oncological outcome after cessation of long-term adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy with favorable prostate-specific antigen control.  Methods:   Among 855 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2012, we identified 56 men with pT2-4N0-1M0 prostate cancer who had received long-term (>2 years) adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy and subsequently stopped it under a condition of continued prostate-specific antigen values <0.1 ng/mL. The oncological outcome was evaluated using biochemical recurrence, defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen values â¥0.2 ng/mL, as the primary endpoint. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. Age at androgen deprivation therapy cessation was dichotomized as <68 years and â¥68 years, based on the most discriminatory cutoff.  Results:   Median duration of adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was 70 months. Overall, 13 of 56 (23%) patients developed biochemical recurrence with a median follow-up period of 41 months after androgen deprivation therapy cessation. Multivariate analysis identified age at androgen deprivation therapy cessation <68 years and pN1 as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. Predisposition of younger age to poorer survival may be related to more frequent testosterone recovery in younger men (73 vs 33%, P = 0.0299). One patient had evidence of clinical metastasis and no one died of prostate cancer.

Methods:   The study included 411 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer with lymph node metastases at 10 tertiary care centers between 1995 and 2014. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates at 8 years' follow up in the overall population, and after stratifying patients according to clinical and pathological parameters. Uni- and multivariable competing risk Cox regression analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality. Finally, cumulative-incidence plots were generated for cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality after stratifying patients according to the number of positive lymph nodes and the median age at surgery, according to the competing risks method.  Results:   Men with prostate-specific antigen â¤40 ng/mL and those with one to three positive lymph nodes showed higher cancer-specific mortality-free survival estimates as compared with their counterparts with prostate-specific antigen >40 ng/mL and >3 metastatic lymph nodes, respectively (all P < 0.001).

There are limited data on the long-term health system costs associated with PCa. The aim of this study is to estimate long-term health care costs of PCa.  Methods:   We estimated the health system costs for a cohort of 1873 males diagnosed with PCa between 2000 and 2002, using linked medical, pharmaceutical and hospital data. Treatment was defined by an initial phase, measuring health care costs up to 6 months following diagnosis and a continuing phase (including metastatic treatment), measuring treatments to 9.5 years. Nonparametric models were used to calculate average health care costs by PCa risk groups at diagnosis (low to metastatic) and treatment pathways.  Results:   Health system costs increased with increasing PCa risk category, from $16 923 (low risk) to $39 101 (metastatic risk group). For men with initial localized risk, costs were $8 454 for the active surveillance treatment pathway, $9621 for external beam radiation therapy/brachytherapy, $19 210 for androgen deprivation therapy, $20 636 for radical prostatectomy, $21 161 for radical prostatectomy + external beam radiation therapy/brachytherapy, $21 388 for any of the treatments previously listed + androgen deprivation therapy, with an additional cost of $55 370 if metastatic treatment was undertaken.  Conclusions:   Treatment costs are highest during two phases over the natural cycle of the disease, the initial diagnosis phase and the metastatic treatment phase.

The log MRI signal intensity for each contoured region (n = 809) was measured, and pairwise comparisons were performed using the open-source software R version 3.0.1.  Results:   Packed grade 3 sub-pattern has a significantly lower MRI intensity than the grade 4 group (P < 0.00001). Sparse grade 3 has a significantly higher MRI intensity than the packed grade 3 sub-pattern (P < 0.0001). No significant difference in MRI intensity was observed between the Gleason grade 4 group and the sparse sub-pattern grade 3 group (P = 0.54). In multivariable analysis adjusting for peripheral zone, the P values maintained significance (packed grade 3 group vs grade 4 group, P < 0.001; and sparse grade 3 sub-pattern vs packed grade 3 sub-pattern, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that T2-weighted MRI signal is dependent on histologic sub-patterns within Gleason grades 3 and 4 cancers, which may have implications for directed biopsy sampling and patient management.""","""['Michelle R Downes', 'Eli Gibson', 'Jenna Sykes', 'Masoom Haider', 'Theo H van der Kwast', 'Aaron Ward']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Assessment of biologic aggressiveness of prostate cancer: correlation of MR signal intensity with Gleason grade after radical prostatectomy.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Assessment of aggressiveness of prostate cancer: correlation of apparent diffusion coefficient with histologic grade after radical prostatectomy.', 'Pre-biopsy 3-Tesla MRI and targeted biopsy of the index prostate cancer: correlation with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Simplified PI-RADS (S-PI-RADS) for biparametric MRI to detect and manage prostate cancer: What urologists need to know.', 'Differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia using whole-lesion histogram and texture analysis of diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging.', 'MRI-targeted prostate biopsy: the next step forward!', 'Conspicuity of prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: A cross-disciplinary translational hypothesis.', 'Grading of prostate cancer: a work in progress.']"""

Src is known to induce cyclin D1, and a cyclin D1-regulated gene expression module predicts poor outcome in human prostate cancer. The tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2/Trop2/M1S1) is enriched in the prostate, promoting prostate stem cell self-renewal upon proteolytic activation via a Î³-secretase cleavage complex (PS1, PS2) and TACE (ADAM17), which releases the Trop2 intracellular domain (Trop2 ICD). Herein, v-Src transformation of primary murine prostate epithelial cells increased the proportion of prostate cancer stem cells as characterized by gene expression, epitope characteristics, and prostatosphere formation. Cyclin D1 was induced by v-Src, and Src kinase induction of Trop2 ICD nuclear accumulation required cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 induced abundance of the Trop2 proteolytic cleavage activation components (PS2, TACE) and restrained expression of the inhibitory component of the Trop2 proteolytic complex (Numb). Patients with prostate cancer with increased nuclear Trop2 ICD and cyclin D1, and reduced Numb, had reduced recurrence-free survival probability (HR = 4.35). Cyclin D1, therefore, serves as a transducer of v-Src-mediated induction of Trop2 ICD by enhancing abundance of the Trop2 proteolytic activation complex. Cancer Res; 76(22); 6723-34.

We identified an RNA helicase gene, DDX3 (DDX3X), which is overexpressed in prostate cancers, and whose expression is directly correlated with high Gleason scores. Knockdown of DDX3 in the aggressive prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1 resulted in significantly reduced clonogenicity. To target DDX3, we rationally designed a small molecule, RK-33, which docks into the ATP-binding domain of DDX3. Functional studies indicated that RK-33 preferentially bound to DDX3 and perturbed its activity. RK-33 treatment of prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP (which have high DDX3 levels) decreased proliferation and induced a G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Conversely, the low DDX3-expressing cell line, PC3, exhibited few changes following RK-33 treatment. Importantly, combination studies using RK-33 and radiation exhibited synergistic effects both in vitro and in a xenograft model of prostate cancer demonstrating the role of RK-33 as a radiosensitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that blocking DDX3 by RK-33 in combination with radiation treatment is a viable option for treating locally advanced prostate cancer.

Methods:   We analyzed men who underwent prostate biopsy at our medical center between July 2012 and June 2014. Long-term other-cause mortality risk was determined using survival tables. Indications for biopsy and biopsy outcomes were assessed, and compared among men with varying mortality risks.  Results:   A total of 417 men underwent prostate biopsy, in whom 14-year other-cause mortality risk ranged from 9% to 74%. One hundred ninety-three men (46.3%) were considered low-mortality risk (<40% risk of 14-year mortality), 131 (31.4%) intermediate risk (41%-55% 14-year mortality), and 93 (22.3%) high risk (>55% 14-year mortality). Of the 417 patients who underwent biopsy, 149 (35.7%) were found to have prostate cancer. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive biopsies (P = .72), distribution of Gleason scores (P = .60), or percentage of positive biopsy cores (P = .74) between mortality risk groups. However, by UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, there was significant trend toward higher-risk prostate cancer in men with intermediate and high-mortality risk (P = .04).  Conclusion:   In this analysis, a large number of men with limited life expectancies underwent prostate biopsy. The majority of these men had negative biopsies or low-risk cancers, suggesting that they were unlikely to benefit from biopsy.

Abi-780 at 20 ÂµM significantly reduced the capabilities of colony formation and migration/invasion potential as well as increasing the apoptosis rate of prostate cancer cells. NIRF imaging using Abi-780 selectively identified the tumors in mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts. Moreover, Abi-780 treatment significantly retarded the tumor growth. No severe systemic toxicity was observed in mice with daily injection of high-dose Abi-780 for one month.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines HSC3, HSC4 and Ca9-22 were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of lapatinib in anchorage-dependent culture, but the OSCC cell lines KB and SAS and the prostate cancer cell line DU145 were resistant to lapatinib.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ErbB2, ErbB3 and Akt and the protein levels of cyclin D1 were decreased by lapatinib treatment of HSC3, HSC4 and Ca9-22 cells. ErbB3 was not expressed and cyclin D1 protein levels were not altered by lapatinib treatment in KB, DU145 and SAS cells. The phosphorylation of ErbB2 and AKT was not affected by lapatinib in SAS cells and was not detected in KB and DU145 cells. Lapatinib-resistant cell lines exhibited sphere-forming ability, and SAS cells developed sensitivity to lapatinib during sphere formation. The phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 and AKT and protein levels of cyclin D2 increased during sphere formation of SAS cells and decreased with lapatinib treatment. In addition, sphere formation of SAS cells was inhibited by the AKT inhibitor MK2206. AKT phosphorylation and cyclin D2 levels in SAS spheres were decreased by MK2206 treatment. SAS cells expressed E-cadherin, but not vimentin and KB cells expressed vimentin, but not E-cadherin. DU145 cells expressed vimentin and E-cadherin.

We sought to optimize the prognostic stratification of grading and developed a method of recording and studying individual architectural patterns by light microscopic evaluation that is independent of standard Gleason grade. Some of the evaluated patterns are not assessed by current Gleason grading (eg, reactive stromal response). Individual histologic patterns were correlated with recurrence-free survival in a retrospective postradical prostatectomy cohort of 1275 patients represented by the highest-grade foci of carcinoma in tissue microarrays. In univariable analysis, fibromucinous rupture with varied epithelial complexity had a significantly lower relative risk of recurrence-free survival in cases graded as 3+4=7. Cases having focal ""poorly formed glands,"" which could be designated as pattern 3+4=7, had lower risk than cribriform patterns with either small cribriform glands or expansile cribriform growth. In separate multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses of both Gleason score 3+3=6 and 3+4=7 carcinomas, reactive stromal patterns were associated with worse recurrence-free survival. Decision tree models demonstrate potential regrouping of architectural patterns into categories with similar risk. In summary, we argue that Gleason score assignment by current consensus guidelines are not entirely optimized for clinical use, including active surveillance. Our data suggest that focal poorly formed gland and cribriform patterns, currently classified as Gleason pattern 4, should be in separate prognostic groups, as the latter is associated with worse outcome. Patterns with extravasated mucin are likely overgraded in a subset of cases with more complex epithelial bridges, whereas stromogenic cancers have a worse outcome than conveyed by Gleason grade alone.

Materials and methods:   Study subjects comprised all 259 men, including 196 with Gleason score 3 + 3 and 63 with Gleason score 3 + 4, who were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided biopsy from 2009 to 2015 and underwent subsequent fusion biopsy for as long as 4 years of active surveillance. The primary end point was the discovery of Gleason score 4 + 3 or greater prostate cancer. Followup biopsies included targeting of positive sites, which were tracked in an Artemisâ¢ device. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to determine upgrading rates, stratified by initial Gleason score and prostate specific antigen density.  Results:   Based on a Cox proportional hazard model, men with Gleason score 3 + 4 were 4.65 times more likely to have upgrading than men with an initial Gleason score of 3 + 3 at 3 years (p <0.01). By the third surveillance year 63% of men with Gleason score 3 + 4 had been upgraded compared with 18.0% who started with Gleason score 3 + 3 (p <0.01). Of all 33 upgrades 32 (97%) occurred at a magnetic resonance imaging visible or a tracked site of tumor, rather than at a previously negative systematic site. Independent predictors of upgrading were Gleason score 3 + 4, prostate specific antigen density 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 or greater and a grade 5 lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. The incidence rate ratio of upgrading (Gleason score 3 + 4 vs 3 + 3) was 4.25 per year of patient followup (p <0.01).  Conclusions:   During active surveillance of prostate cancer, targeting of tracked tumor foci by magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy allows for heightened detection of Gleason score 4 + 3 or greater cancers. Baseline variables directly related to important upgrading that warrant increased vigilance include Gleason score 3 + 4, prostate specific antigen density 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 or greater and grade 5 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging.""","""['Nima Nassiri', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Shyam Natarajan', 'Devi S Sharma', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Frederick J Dorey', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Value of Tracking Biopsy in Men Undergoing Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Confirmatory Biopsy for Initiating Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in active surveillance of prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: a scoping review on the benefits and harm of mpMRI in different biopsy scenarios.', 'Abbreviated Versus Multiparametric Prostate MRI in Active Surveillance for Prostate-Cancer Patients: Comparison of Accuracy and Clinical Utility as a Decisional Tool.', 'Unified model involving genomics, magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density outperforms individual co-variables at predicting biopsy upgrading in patients on active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance inclusion criteria under scrutiny in magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy: a multicenter cohort study.', 'Role of MRI-Based Functional Imaging in Improving the Therapeutic Index of Radiotherapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'Optimal biopsy approach for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

Rather, they are often informed by mathematical models that approximate reality. Often multiple models have been made to study the same phenomenon, which may lead to conflicting decisions. It is natural to seek a decision making process that identifies decisions that all models find to be effective, and we propose such a framework in this work. We apply the framework in prostate cancer screening to identify prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based strategies that perform well under all considered models. We use heuristic search to identify strategies that trade off between optimizing the average across all models' assessments and being ""conservative"" by optimizing the most pessimistic model assessment. We identified three recently published mathematical models that can estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of PSA-based screening strategies and identified 64 strategies that trade off between maximizing the average and the most pessimistic model assessments. All prescribe PSA thresholds that increase with age, and 57 involve biennial screening. Strategies with higher assessments with the pessimistic model start screening later, stop screening earlier, and use higher PSA thresholds at earlier ages. The 64 strategies outperform 22 previously published expert-generated strategies. The 41 most ""conservative"" ones remained better than no screening with all models in extensive sensitivity analyses. We augment current comparative modeling approaches by identifying strategies that perform well under all models, for various degrees of decision makers' conservativeness.""","""['Dimitris Bertsimas', 'John Silberholz', 'Thomas Trikalinos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Health Care Manag Sci""","""['National trends in prostate cancer screening among older American men with limited 9-year life expectancies: evidence of an increased need for shared decision making.', 'Applying strategies from libertarian paternalism to decision making for prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening.', 'Benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening - predictions of the ONCOTYROL prostate cancer outcome and policy model.', 'Focus on the screening for prostate cancer by PSA.', 'Elderly and prostate cancer screening.', 'Operations Management Interventions in Cancer Care Delivery in LMICs: The Way Forward.', 'A Collaborative and Ubiquitous System for Fabricating Dental Parts Using 3D Printing Technologies.', 'Operational research techniques applied throughout cancer care services: a review.', ""Decision models for distinguishing between clinically insignificant and significant tumors in prostate cancer biopsies: an application of Bayes' Theorem to reduce costs and improve outcomes.""]"""

LHRH acts by binding to receptors located in the pituitary gland. These receptors (LHRH receptors) have also been found in the cytoplasm of many tumor cells that involve both the reproductive and non-reproductive organs. These receptors have been demonstrated in prostate and breast cancers, endometrial carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, carcinoma of liver, pancreas and skin. So far, the expression of LHRH receptors on sarcomas (i.e. malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin) has not been studied, except for endometrial sarcomas. It has also been demonstrated that both LHRH agonists and antagonists can down-regulate these receptors and thus inhibit these tumor cells. Another major therapeutic implication is that these receptors can be targeted specifically by peptides conjugated to anti-cancer drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine if LHRH receptors are expressed in primary and/or metastatic sarcomas of human origin.  Methods:   We looked at LHRH receptor expression in 38 consecutive sarcoma specimens, using immunohistochemistry. The specimens were either from office biopsy or from resected tumor; these were confirmed as sarcomas by histopathological examination. The receptor staining characteristics and the staining intensity were also documented. The pattern of staining was classified either as ""focal or diffuse staining of the cytoplasm"" and the intensity of staining was graded on a scale from 1+ to 4+.  Results:   Positive receptor staining was seen in 25 of the 38 (66%) specimens. Twelve of the specimens stained diffusely and 13 had focally positive staining. Three tumors had 1+ staining, 10 had 2+ staining, six had 3+ staining, and six tumors had 4+ staining. The tumors included undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, metastatic chondrosarcoma and chordoma.  Conclusion:   Sarcomas express LHRH receptors with a varying incidence and degree.

Yet, the complete molecular mechanisms controlling the transcriptional output of engaged enhancers and subsequent activation of coding genes remain elusive. Here, we report that CTCF binding to enhancer RNAs is enriched when breast cancer cells are stimulated with estrogen. CTCF binding to enhancer regions results in modulation of estrogen-induced gene transcription by preventing Estrogen Receptor chromatin binding and by hindering the formation of additional enhancer-promoter ER looping. Furthermore, the depletion of CTCF facilitates the expression of target genes associated with cell division and increases the rate of breast cancer cell proliferation. We have also uncovered a genomic network connecting loci enriched in cell cycle regulator genes to nuclear lamina that mediates the CTCF function. The nuclear lamina and chromatin interactions are regulated by estrogen-ER. We have observed that the chromatin loops formed when cells are treated with estrogen establish contacts with the nuclear lamina. Once there, the portion of CTCF associated with the nuclear lamina interacts with enhancer regions, limiting the formation of ER loops and the induction of genes present in the loop. Collectively, our results reveal an important, unanticipated interplay between CTCF and nuclear lamina to control the transcription of ER target genes, which has great implications in the rate of growth of breast cancer cells.""","""['Elisa Fiorito', 'Yogita Sharma', 'Siv Gilfillan', 'Shixiong Wang', 'Sachin Kumar Singh', 'Somisetty V Satheesh', 'Madhumohan R Katika', 'Alfonso Urbanucci', 'Bernd Thiede', 'Ian G Mills', 'Antoni Hurtado']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['A co-ordinated interaction between CTCF and ER in breast cancer cells.', 'Impact of 3D genome organization, guided by cohesin and CTCF looping, on sex-biased chromatin interactions and gene expression in mouse liver.', 'CTCF: the protein, the binding partners, the binding sites and their chromatin loops.', 'Variable Extent of Lineage-Specificity and Developmental Stage-Specificity of Cohesin and CCCTC-Binding Factor Binding Within the Immunoglobulin and T Cell Receptor Loci.', 'CTCF shapes chromatin structure and gene expression in health and disease.', 'Enhancer in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Long-range gene regulation in hormone-dependent cancer.', 'CTCF and Its Multi-Partner Network for Chromatin Regulation.', 'Chromatin Organization and Transcriptional Programming of Breast Cancer Cell Identity.', 'BAP18 facilitates CTCF-mediated chromatin accessible to regulate enhancer activity in breast cancer.']"""

We previously showed that HHT, in which systemic endoglin expression is reduced, was associated with better survival outcomes in cancer patients (Duarte et al. in Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 23:117-125, 2014). Here, we evaluated whether HHT was associated with reduced cancer incidence.  Methods:   A matched case-control analysis using SEER Medicare was conducted to evaluate the effect of HHT on diagnosis with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 (n = 633,162). Cancer and non-cancer patients were matched on age, sex, SEER registry region, and length of the ascertainment period for HHT. We assessed crude association using a McNemar's test and then adjusted for demographic variables, cancer type, cancer stage, comorbidities, and ascertainment period with a conditional logistic regression model for cancer incidence.  Results:   The McNemar's test showed no significant association between HHT and cancer incidence (p = 0.74). Adjusting for covariates with the conditional logistic regression model did not change the result [HHT odds ratio 0.978; 95 % CI (0.795, 1.204)]. The lack of association between HHT and cancer incidence is unexpected given the previously discovered significant association between HHT and improved survival outcomes (Duarte et al. in Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 23:117-125, 2014).

We now report prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics following high-dose SBRT in patients treated with radiation alone.  Methods and materials:   Ninety-one patients were enrolled on the phase 1/2 dose escalation study of SBRT for localized prostate cancer. All patients with at least 36 months of follow-up and without hormone therapy were included in this analysis (n = 47). Treatment response parameters evaluated include time to nadir, nadir value, occurrence of PSA bounces (rise of â¥0.2 ng/mL followed by a subsequent fall), magnitude of bounces, duration of bounces, and correlation of bounces with clinical outcomes.  Results:   Median follow-up was 42 months (range, 36-78 months). Treatment dose levels were 45 Gy (n = 10), 47.5 Gy (n = 8), and 50 Gy (n = 29) in 5 fractions. Biochemical control rate was 98%. Median PSA at follow-up was 0.10 Â± 0.20 ng/mL. Median time to nadir was 36 Â± 11 months. A total of 24/47 (51.1%) patients had â¥1 PSA bounce. Median magnitude of PSA rise during bounce was 0.50 Â± 1.2 ng/mL. Median time to first bounce was 9 Â± 7.0 months. Median bounce duration was 3 Â± 2.3 months for the first bounce and 6 Â± 5.2 months for subsequent bounces. Prostate volumes <30 mL were associated with a decreased likelihood of bounce (P = .0202), and increasing prostate volume correlated with increasingly likelihood of having â¥2 bounces (P = .027). Patients reaching PSA nadir of â¤0.1 ng/mL were less likely to experience any bounce (P = .0044).  Conclusions:   Compared with other SBRT experiences, our study demonstrated a higher PSA bounce rate, a similar or shorter median time to bounce, and a very low nadir.

We report patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from a randomized trial comparing hypofractionated and conventional prostate radiotherapy.  Methods:   Men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in a trial that randomized men to either conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (CIMRT, 75.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions) or to dose-escalated hypofractionated IMRT (HIMRT, 72 Gy in 2.4 Gy fractions).

The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial undertook a large-scale effort to create a public resource of pathology tissues from PLCO participants who developed a cancer during the trial.  Methods:   Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained from pathology laboratories on a loan basis for central processing of tissue microarrays, with additional free-standing tissue cores collected for nucleic acid extraction.  Results:   Pathology tissue specimens were obtained for prostate cancer (n = 1,052), lung cancer (n = 434), colorectal cancer (n = 675) and adenoma (n = 658), ovarian cancer and borderline tumors (n = 212), breast cancer (n = 870), and bladder cancer (n = 204). The process of creating this resource was complex, involving multidisciplinary teams with expertise in pathology, epidemiology, information technology, project management, and specialized laboratories.  Conclusions:   Creating the PLCO tissue resource required a multistep process, including obtaining medical records and contacting pathology departments where pathology materials were stored after obtaining necessary patient consent and authorization. The potential to link tissue biomarkers to prospectively collected epidemiologic information, screening and clinical data, and matched blood or buccal samples offers valuable opportunities to study etiologic heterogeneity, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and biomarkers for early detection and prognosis.  Impact:   The methods and protocols developed for this effort, and the detailed description of this resource provided here, will be useful for those seeking to use PLCO pathology tissue specimens for their research and may also inform future tissue collection efforts in other settings.

To meet the clinical need for a more cost-effective alternative, the PSMA-I&T-based tracer concept was adapted to 99mTc-labeling chemistry. Two PSMA-I&T-derived inhibitors with all-L-serine- (MAS3) and all-D-serine- (mas3) chelating moieties were evaluated in parallel, and a kit procedure for routine 99mTc labeling was developed.  Methods:   PSMA affinities (IC50) and internalization kinetics of 99mTc-MAS3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) and 99mTc-mas3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) (99mTc-PSMA-I&S for imaging and surgery) were determined using LNCaP cells and (125I-BA)KuE as a radioligand and reference standard. In vivo metabolite analyses and biodistribution studies were performed using CD-1 nu/nu and LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The pharmacokinetics of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S in humans were investigated in a patient with advanced metastatic PCa via sequential planar whole-body SPECT imaging at 1, 3, 5, and 21 h after injection. Additionally, preoperative SPECT/CT (12 h after injection) and 99mTc-PSMA-I&S-supported RGS (16 h after injection) were performed in 1 PCa patient with proven iliac and inguinal lymph node metastases.  Results:   A robust and reliable kit-labeling procedure was established, allowing the preparation of 99mTc-MAS3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) and 99mTc-PSMA-I&S in consistently high radiochemical yield and purity (â¥98%, n > 50 preparations). Because of its improved internalization efficiency and superior in vivo stability, 99mTc-PSMA-I&S was selected for further in vivo evaluation. Compared with 111In-PSMA-I&T, 99mTc-PSMA-I&S showed delayed clearance kinetics but identical uptake in PSMA-positive tissues in the LNCaP xenograft model (1 h after injection). In exemplary PCa patients, a relatively slow whole-body clearance of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S was observed due to high plasma protein binding (94%) of the tracer. This, however, promoted efficient tracer uptake in PCa lesions over time and led to steadily increasing lesion-to-background ratios up to 21 h after injection. Preoperative SPECT/CT showed a high 99mTc-PSMA-I&S uptake in all suspect lesions identified in previous 68Ga-HBED-CC-Ahx-KuE (68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA) PET/CT, allowing for their successful intraoperative detection and resection during first-in-human RGS.  Conclusion:   Because of a straightforward and reliable kit production, 99mTc-PSMA-I&S represents a cost-effective, readily available alternative to 111In-PSMA-I&T. Initial patient data indicate its comparable or even superior performance as a probe for PSMA-targeted RGS and also hint toward the unexpected potential of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S as a SPECT imaging agent.""","""['Stephanie Robu', 'Margret Schottelius', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Tobias Maurer', 'JÃ¼rgen Gschwend', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Hans-JÃ¼rgen Wester']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Synthesis and Preclinical Characterization of the PSMA-Targeted Hybrid Tracer PSMA-I&F for Nuclear and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '99mTechnetium-based Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localised recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Clinical advancement of precision theranostics in prostate cancer.', 'Development of in-House Synthesis and Quality Control of 99mTcTc-PSMA-I&S.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.', '99mTcTc-PSMA-T4-Novel SPECT Tracer for Metastatic PCa: From Bench to Clinic.', 'System-level optimization in spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

This pathway is constitutively active and drives prostate cancer (PCa) progression to advanced metastatic disease. PTEN, a critical tumor and metastasis suppressor gene negatively regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis via the PI3K/Akt pathway. PTEN is mutated, downregulated/dysfunctional in many cancers and its dysregulation correlates with poor prognosis in PCa. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-4534 (miR-4534) is overexpressed in PCa and show that miR-4534 is hypermethylated in normal tissues and cell lines compared to PCa tissues/cells. miR-4534 exerts its oncogenic effects partly by downregulating the tumor suppressor PTEN gene. Knockdown of miR-4534 impaired cell proliferation, migration/invasion and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa. Suppression of miR-4534 and its effects on tumor growth was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. We performed parallel experiments in non-cancer RWPE1 cells by overexpessing miR-4534 followed by functional assays. Overexpression of miR-4534 induced pro-cancerous characteristics in this non-cancer cell line. Statistical analyses revealed that miR-4534 has potential to independently distinguish malignant from normal tissues and positively correlated with poor overall and PSA recurrence free survival. Taken together, our results show that depletion of miR-4534 in PCa induces a tumor suppressor phenotype partly through induction of PTEN. These results have important implications for identifying and defining the role of new PTEN regulators such as microRNAs in prostate tumorigenesis. Understanding aberrantly overexpressed miR-4534 and its downregulation of PTEN will provide mechanistic insight and therapeutic targets for PCa therapy.""","""['Hannah Nip', 'Altaf A Dar', 'Sharanjot Saini', 'Melissa Colden', 'Shahryari Varahram', 'Harshika Chowdhary', 'Soichiro Yamamura', 'Yozo Mitsui', 'Yuichiro Tanaka', 'Taku Kato', 'Yutaka Hashimoto', 'Marisa Shiina', 'Priyanka Kulkarni', 'Pritha Dasgupta', 'Mitsuho Imai-Sumida', 'Z Laura Tabatabai', 'Kirsten Greene', 'Guoren Deng', 'Rajvir Dahiya', 'Shahana Majid']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Upregulation of miR-153 promotes cell proliferation via downregulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-498 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells and decreases radiation sensitivity by targeting PTEN.', 'MicroRNA-498 promotes proliferation and migration by targeting the tumor suppressor PTEN in breast cancer cells.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulatory role of microRNAs on PTEN signaling.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Alteration in Levels of Specific miRNAs and Their Potential Protein Targets between Human Pancreatic Cancer Samples, Adjacent Normal Tissue, and Xenografts Derived from These Tumors.', 'Identification and characterization of extracellular vesicles from red cells infected with Babesia divergens and Babesia microti.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as new tools for delivery of miRNAs in the treatment of cancer.', 'microRNA Profile Associated with Positive Lymph Node Metastasis in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer.']"""

Identify lncRNA competitively regulated subpathway not only can gain insight into the initiation and progression of disease, but also help for understanding the functional roles of lncRNAs in the disease context. Here, we present an effective method, Subpathway-LNCE, which was specifically designed to identify lncRNAs competitively regulated functions and the functional roles of these competitive regulation lncRNAs have not be well characterized in diseases. Moreover, the method integrated lncRNA-mRNA expression profile and pathway topologies. Using prostate cancer datasets and LUAD data sets, we confirmed the effectiveness of our method in identifying disease associated dysfunctional subpathway that regulated by lncRNAs. By analyzing kidney renal clear cell carcinoma related lncRNA competitively regulated subpathway network, we show that Subpathway-LNCE can help uncover disease key lncRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method is reproducible and robust. Subpathway-LNCE provide a flexible tool to identify lncRNA competitively regulated signal subpathways underlying certain condition, and help to expound the functional roles of lncRNAs in various status.

Using the TRAMP mouse model of human prostate cancer, we address mechanisms of deregulation for the cancer-associated transcription factors, Runx1 and Runx2 by identifying microRNAs with reciprocal expression changes at six time points during 33 weeks of tumorigenesis. We molecularly define transition stages from PIN lesions to hyperplasia/neoplasia and progression to adenocarcinoma by temporal changes in expression of human prostate cancer markers, including the androgen receptor and tumor suppressors, Nkx3.1 and PTEN. Concomitant activation of PTEN, AR, and Runx factors occurs at early stages. At late stages, PTEN and AR are downregulated, while Runx1 and Runx2 remain elevated.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate, systematically, the carcinogenic activity of cadmium with systems biology approaches. From a literature search of 209 studies that performed with cellular models, 208 proteins influenced by cadmium exposure were identified. All of these were assessed by Western blotting and were recognized as key nodes in network analyses. The protein-protein functional interaction networks were constructed with NetBox software and visualized with Cytoscape software. These cadmium-rewired genes were used to construct a scale-free, highly connected biological protein interaction network with 850 nodes and 8770 edges. Of the network, nine key modules were identified and 60 key signaling pathways, including the estrogen, RAS, PI3K-Akt, NF-ÎºB, HIF-1Î±, Jak-STAT, and TGF-Î² signaling pathways, were significantly enriched. With breast cancer, colorectal and prostate cancer cellular models, we validated the key node genes in the network that had been previously reported or inferred form the network by Western blotting methods, including STAT3, JNK, p38, SMAD2/3, P65, AKT1, and HIF-1Î±.

However, the molecular mechanisms of AR action in fibroblasts and other non-epithelial cell types are largely unknown. The genome-wide DNA binding profile of AR in human prostate fibroblasts was identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and found to be common to other fibroblast lines but disparate from AR cistromes of prostate cancer cells and tissue. Although AR binding sites specific to fibroblasts were less well conserved evolutionarily than those shared with cancer epithelia, they were likewise correlated with androgen regulation of fibroblast gene expression. Whereas FOXA1 is the key pioneer factor of AR in cancer epithelia, our data indicated that AP-1 likely plays a more important role in the AR cistrome in fibroblasts. The specificity of AP-1 and FOXA1 to binding in these cells is demonstrated using immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Importantly, we find the fibroblast cistrome is represented in whole tissue/in vivo ChIP-seq studies at both genomic and resulting protein levels, highlighting the importance of the stroma in whole tissue -omic studies.

Currently, the etiology of prostate fieldâeffect formation is unknown and there is a prominent lack of knowledge of the underlying cellular and molecular pathways. We have previously identified an upregulated expression of several protein factors representative of prostate field effect, i.e., early growth response-1 (EGRâ1), platelet-derived growth factorâA (PDGFâA), macrophage inhibitory cytokineâ1 (MICâ1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) in tissues at a distance of 1 cm from the visible margin of intracapsule prostate adenocarcinomas. We have hypothesized that the transcription factor EGRâ1 could be a key regulator of prostate fieldâeffect formation by controlling the expression of PDGFâA, MICâ1, and FASN. Taking advantage of our extensive quantitative immunofluorescence data specific for EGRâ1, PDGFâA, MICâ1, and FASN generated in diseaseâfree, tumorâadjacent, and cancerous human prostate tissues, we chose comprehensive correlation as our major approach to test this hypothesis. Despite the static nature and sample heterogeneity of association studies, we show here that sophisticated data generation, such as by spectral image acquisition, linear unmixing, and digital quantitative imaging, can provide meaningful indications of molecular regulations in a physiologically relevant in situ environment. Our data suggest that EGRâ1 acts as a key regulator of prostate field effect through induction of proâproliferative (PDGFâA and FASN), and suppression of proâapoptotic (MICâ1) factors. These findings were corroborated by computational promoter analyses and cell transfection experiments in nonâcancerous prostate epithelial cells with ectopically induced and suppressed EGRâ1 expression.

Design and setting:   A cross-sectional validation study using linked data from primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR).  Population:   290 000 patients, registered with 120 general practitioners (GPs), from 50 practice centres in the Utrecht area, the Netherlands, in January 2013.  Intervention:   Linking the EHRs of all patients in the Julius General Practitioners' Network database at an individual patient level to the full NCR (â¼1.7 million tumours between 1989 and 2011), to determine the proportion of matching cancer diagnoses. Full-text EHR extraction and manual analysis for non-matching diagnoses.  Main outcome measures:   Proportions of matching and non-matching breast, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer diagnoses between 2007 and 2011, stratified by age category, cancer type and EHR system. Differences in year of diagnosis between the EHR and the NCR. Reasons for non-matching diagnoses.  Results:   In the Primary Care EHR, 60.6% of cancer cases were registered and coded in accordance with the NCR. Of the EHR diagnoses, 48.9% were potentially false positive (not registered in the NCR). Results differed between EHR systems but not between age categories or cancer types. The year of diagnosis corresponded in 80.6% of matching coded diagnoses. Adding full-text EHR analysis improved results substantially. A national disease registry (the NCR) proved incomplete.  Conclusions:   Even though GPs do know their patients with cancer, only 60.6% are coded in concordance with the NCR. Reusers of coded EHR data should be aware that 40% of cases can be missed, and almost half can be false positive. The type of EHR system influences registration quality.

A model-based approach for patient selection""","""Background and purpose:   Previous studies confirmed that implantable rectum spacers (IRS) decreased acute gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity in a significant percentage of prostate cancer patients undergoing intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). We developed decision rules based on clinical risk factors (CRFs) to select those patients who are expected to benefit most from IRS implantation.  Materials and methods:   For 26 patients dose distributions with (IMRT+IRS) and without (IMRT-IRS) IRS were calculated. Validated nomograms based on CRFs and dosimetric criteria (anorectal V40Gy and V75Gy) were used to predict probabilities for grade 2-3 (G2-3) acute GI toxicity, G2-3 late rectal bleeding (LRB), G3 LRB, and G2-3 faecal incontinence (FI) for IMRT+IRS and IMRT-IRS. All permutations of CRFs were generated to identify most benefit scenarios (MBS) in which a predicted toxicity reduction of â©¾5% points in â©¾25% of the cohort was present due to IRS implantation.  Results:   IMRT+IRS revealed a significant reduction in V40Gy (p=0.0357) and V75Gy (p<0.0001) relative to IMRT-IRS. For G2-3 acute GI toxicity and G2-3 LRB, the predicted toxicity rates decreased in 17/26 (65%) and 20/26 (77%) patients, and decision rules were derived for 22/32 (69%) and 12/64 (19%) MBS, respectively. From the decision rules, it follows that diabetes status has no impact on G2-3 acute toxicity, and in absence of pre-RT abdominal surgery, the implantation of an IRS is predicted to show no clinically relevant benefit for G2-3 LRB.

Gleason score is the best predictor of PCa aggressiveness and prognosis. In the present study, we generated an epigenetic signature based on high versus low Gleason score tumors and evaluated its ability to predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Genome-wide DNA methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; no. of patients = 333) and the elastic net method were used to generate an epigenetic signature by contrasting patients with high (8-10) versus low (â¤6) Gleason score tumors. The signature was then tested in a cohort of 523 patients with clinically localized disease who had radical prostatectomy. Samples taken from the primary tumor were used for DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiling. Patients were followed for PCa recurrence on average for 8 years after diagnosis.  Results:   The epigenetic signature includes 52 differentially methylated CpG sites. In the testing cohort, the signature was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio per 25 % increase = 1.78; 95 % confidence interval 1.48, 2.16). The signature significantly improved the area under the curve (AUC) for PCa recurrence compared to clinical-pathological parameters alone, particularly among patients diagnosed with Gleason score 7 tumors (0.64 vs. 0.76, P = 1.34E-4). Results were comparable for patients with Gleason 3 + 4 and those with 4 + 3 tumors. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that higher levels of the signature were associated with increased expression of genes related to cell cycle proliferation and decreased expression of androgen-responsive genes.  Conclusions:   This report shows evidence that DNA methylation patterns measured in prostate tumor cells are predictive of PCa aggressiveness. The epigenetic signature may have clinical utility to improve prognostication particularly in patients with intermediate Gleason score 7 tumors.""","""['Milan S Geybels', 'Jonathan L Wright', 'Marina Bibikova', 'Brandy Klotzle', 'Jian-Bing Fan', 'Shanshan Zhao', 'Ziding Feng', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Janet L Stanford']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Gene expression signature of Gleason score is associated with prostate cancer outcomes in a radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'DNA methylation screening of primary prostate tumors identifies SRD5A2 and CYP11A1 as candidate markers for assessing risk of biochemical recurrence.', 'Methylation profiling identified novel differentially methylated markers including OPCML and FLRT2 in prostate cancer.', 'Global DNA hypomethylation in prostate cancer development and progression: a systematic review.', 'Genomic testing for localized prostate cancer: where do we go from here?', 'Methylation Subtypes of Primary Prostate Cancer Predict Poor Prognosis.', 'Signature Panel of 11 Methylated mRNAs and 3 Methylated lncRNAs for Prediction of Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'MYC DNA Methylation in Prostate Tumor Tissue Is Associated with Gleason Score.', 'Epigenetic signature predicts overall survival clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Identification of transcription factor co-regulators that drive prostate cancer progression.']"""

We use a novel approach by studying any cancers in large three-generation families and thus are able to find risks even though penetrance is low.  Methods:   Individuals in the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were organised in three generations and the relative risk (RR) of cancer was calculated to the persons in the third generation by the numbers of patients with cancer in generations 1, 2 and 3.  Results:   The RRs for any cancer in generation 3 increased by the numbers of affected relatives, reaching 1.61 when at least seven relatives were diagnosed. The median patient had two affected relatives, and 7.0% had five or more affected relatives with an RR of 1.46, which translated to an absolute risk of 21.5% compared with 14.7% in population by age 65 years. For prostate cancer, the RR was 2.85 with four or more affected family members with any cancer, and it increased to 14.42 with four or more concordant cancers in family members. RRs for prostate cancer were approximately equal (2.70 vs 2.85) if a man had one relative with prostate cancer or four or more relatives diagnosed with any cancer.  Conclusions:   A strong family history of cancer, regardless of tumour type, increases cancer risk of family members and calls for mechanistic explanations.

To comprehensively understand the molecular process of carcinogenesis of colorectal carcinoma is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. EphA5 is a member of the Eph family and plays a critical role in carcinogenesis of lung cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. The expression profile and the role of EphA5 in colorectal carcinoma have not been well investigated till now. In this study, a set of colorectal carcinoma specimens was subjected to immunohistochemical assay using an EphA5 specific antibody. The relationship between the expression of EphA5 and clinicopathological parameters was statistically analyzed. EphA5 was positively expressed in all tested normal mucosa specimens (120/120, 100%) and partly in colorectal carcinoma specimens (70/120, 58.3%). The loss of EphA5 protein was associated with depth of wall invasion (P=0.002), poor tumor differentiation (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), and advanced TNM stage (P<0.001).

Patients and methods:   Data on 172 patients with locally adverse pathologic features (including seminal vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, or positive surgical margins) who had been treated with wait and see policy after RP were retrospectively analyzed for biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association between the GGGs and BCR. Finally, concordance indices of different grading classifications were calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy for biochemical failure after RP.  Results:   The five-year BCR-free survival rates were 71.2, 66.9, 25.7, 17.4, and 8.3 % for GGG 1-5 assessed on surgical specimens (p < 0.001, log-rank test).

Expression of miR-17-92a miRNAs improved sensitivity of androgen dependent LNCaP 104-S prostate cancer cells to anti-androgen drug Casodex, AKT inhibitor MK-2206 2HCl, and docetaxel. The androgen refractory PC-3 cells also showed increased sensitivity to docetaxel, MK-2206 2HCl and Aurora kinase inhibitor VX680 upon ectopic expression of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs. Our data demonstrate a tumor suppressor effect of miR-17-92a cluster miRNAs in prostate cancer cells and restoration of expression of these miRNAs has a therapeutic benefit for both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.""","""['Richard Ottman', 'Jenna Levy', 'William E Grizzle', 'Ratna Chakrabarti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-92a promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer metastasis.', 'Good or not good: Role of miR-18a in cancer biology.', 'miR-154* and miR-379 in the DLK1-DIO3 microRNA mega-cluster regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'miR-92 is a key oncogenic component of the miR-17-92 cluster in colon cancer.', 'Biology of MiR-17-92 Cluster and Its Progress in Lung Cancer.', 'Epiregulin expression and secretion is increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer function of microRNA-30e is mediated by negative regulation of HELLPAR, a noncoding macroRNA, and genes involved in ubiquitination and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', 'High expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p predicts favorable disease-specific survival in stage I-III colon cancer.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor and microRNA Interactions in Androgen-Dependent Diseases.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

Inflammation and focal atrophy are common pathological findings in prostate biopsies, currently not routinely included in surgical pathology reports. The objective of the study was to determine the correlation between inflammation and focal atrophy with prostate adenocarcinoma. Prostate needle biopsies from 203 patients with clinical parameters suspicious for malignancy were evaluated for the presence and extent of chronic inflammation, type and grade of focal atrophy, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma. Relations among them and with age were also analyzed. Ï(2) tests and binary logistic regression were used to estimate associations. Chronic inflammation was observed in 77.3% of the biopsies, significantly associated to adenocarcinoma (P = .031). Moderate/severe inflammation in at least 1 biopsy core increased the risk of prostate adenocarcinoma (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-6.8), whereas glandular localization of inflammation decreased the risk. Focal atrophy was present in 72.9% of the biopsies, proliferative inflammatory atrophy was the most common type, and its grade was significantly associated to inflammation (P < .0001) and inflammation intensity (P = .003). An association between prostate adenocarcinoma and inflammation was found, with higher odds in presence of moderate/severe inflammation in at least 1 biopsy core.

However, its mechanisms of action and its effects on non-tumor cells, fundamental to understand its real efficacy as chemopreventive agent, remain largely unknown. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase acting as signaling mediator of different stimuli, behaves as tumor-suppressor in prostate. Since, PYK2 and RSV share several fields of interaction, including oxidative stress, we have investigated their functional relationship in human non-transformed prostate EPN cells and in their tumor-prone counterpart EPN-PKM, expressing a PYK2 dead-kinase mutant. We show that RSV has a strong biological activity in both cell lines, decreasing ROS production, inducing morphological changes and reversible growth arrest, and activating autophagy but not apoptosis. Interestingly, the PYK2 mutant increases basal ROS and autophagy levels, and modulates the intensity of RSV effects. In particular, the anti-oxidant effect of RSV is more potent in EPN than in EPN-PKM, whereas its anti-proliferative and pro-autophagic effects are more significant in EPN-PKM. Consistently, PYK2 depletion by RNAi replicates the effects of the PKM mutant. Taken together, our results reveal that PYK2 and RSV act on common cellular pathways and suggest that RSV effects on prostate cells may depend on mutational-state or expression levels of PYK2 that emerges as a possible mediator of RSV mechanisms of action. Moreover, the observation that resveratrol effects are reversible and not associated to apoptosis in tumor-prone EPN-PKM cells suggests caution for its use in humans.""","""['Andrea Conte', 'Annamaria Kisslinger', 'Claudio Procaccini', 'Simona Paladino', 'Olimpia Oliviero', 'Francesca de Amicis', 'Deriggio Faicchia', 'Dominga Fasano', 'Marilena Caputo', 'Giuseppe Matarese', 'Giovanna Maria Pierantoni', 'Donatella Tramontano']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['cAMP and Pyk2 interact to regulate prostate cell proliferation and function.', 'Loss of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 function induces spreading and motility of epithelial prostate cells.', 'Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 regulates proliferation and differentiation of prostate cells.', 'Role of Pyk2 in Human Cancers.', 'Synergistic effect of resveratrol and radiotherapy in control of cancers.', 'Aberrant Notch signaling in gliomas: a potential landscape of actionable converging targets for combination approach in therapies resistance.', 'The emerging potentials of lncRNA DRAIC in human cancers.', 'A Notch inhibitor plus Resveratrol induced blockade of autophagy drives glioblastoma cell death by promoting a switch to apoptosis.', 'Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)1.', 'The Tumor Suppressor PTEN as Molecular Switch Node Regulating Cell Metabolism and Autophagy: Implications in Immune System and Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   The current study is a prospective population-based cohort study including 10 318 participants for whom baseline measurements of free T4 (FT4) and/or TSH were available.  Main outcome measures:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) of any solid non-skin cancer, as well as lung, breast, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancer specifically.  Results:   Higher FT4 levels were associated with a higher risk of any solid cancer (HR, 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.79), lung cancer (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.39-3.92) and breast (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.10-2.84) cancer. The risk estimates were similar after exclusion of thyroid-altering medication, but the association lost significance for breast cancer. Compared with the lowest FT4 tertile, the highest tertile was associated with a 1.13-fold increased risk of any solid, 1.79-fold increased risk of lung, and 1.14-fold increased risk of breast cancer (P for trend <.05 for all). For TSH levels we found no associations with cancer risk. There was no differential effect of sex or age on the association between thyroid function and cancer risk.

However, often resulting deformations are not satisfying, since varying deformation properties of different anatomical regions are not considered. To improve the plausibility of DIR in adaptive radiotherapy in the male pelvic area, this work integrates a local rigidity deformation model into a DIR algorithm.  Methods:   A DIR framework is extended by constraints, enforcing locally rigid deformation behavior for arbitrary delineated structures. The approach restricts those structures to rigid deformations, while surrounding tissue is still allowed to deform elastically. The algorithm is tested on ten CT/CBCT male pelvis datasets with active rigidity constraints on bones and prostate and compared to the Varian SmartAdapt deformable registration (VSA) on delineations of bladder, prostate and bones.  Results:   The approach with no rigid structures (REG0) obtains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.87 Â± 0.06 and a Hausdorff-Distance (HD) of 8.74 Â± 5.95 mm. The new approach with rigid bones (REG1) yields a DSC of 0.87 Â± 0.07, HD 8.91 Â± 5.89 mm. Rigid deformation of bones and prostate (REG2) obtains 0.87 Â± 0.06, HD 8.73 Â± 6.01 mm, while VSA yields a DSC of 0.86 Â± 0.07, HD 10.22 Â± 6.62 mm. No deformation grid foldings are observed for REG0 and REG1 in 7 of 10 cases; for REG2 in 8 of 10 cases, with no grid foldings in prostate, an average of 0.08 % in bladder (REG2: no foldings) and 0.01 % inside the body contour. VSA exhibits grid foldings in each case, with an average percentage of 1.81 % for prostate, 1.74 % for bladder and 0.12 % for the body contour. While REG1 and REG2 keep bones rigid, elastic bone deformations are observed with REG0 and VSA. An average runtime of 26.2 s was achieved with REG1; 31.1 s with REG2, compared to 10.5 s with REG0 and 10.7 s with VMS.  Conclusions:   With accuracy in the range of VSA, the new approach with constraints delivers physically more plausible deformations in the pelvic area with guaranteed rigidity of arbitrary structures.

However, evidence from prospective studies remains limited. Therefore, we assessed the associations of vasectomy with prostate cancer incidence and mortality in a large cohort in the United States. Patients and Methods We examined the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer mortality among 363,726 men in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort, of whom 7,451 died as a result of prostate cancer during follow-up from 1982 to 2012. We also examined the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer incidence among 66,542 men in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a subgroup of the CPS-II cohort, of whom 9,133 were diagnosed with prostate cancer during follow-up from 1992 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Results In the CPS-II cohort, vasectomy was not associated with prostate cancer mortality (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.10). In the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, vasectomy was not associated with either overall prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.08) or high-grade prostate cancer incidence (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.07 for cancers with Gleason score â¥ 8).

Even so, additional improvements are needed, such as employing a strategically chosen promoter to drive expression of the transgene in the target cell. Previously, we described viral vectors where high-level transgene expression was achieved using a p53-responsive promoter. Here we present an adenoviral vector (AdPGp53) where p53 is employed to regulate its own expression and which outperforms a traditional vector when tested in a model of gene therapy for prostate cancer. The functionality of AdPGp53 and AdCMVp53 were compared in human prostate carcinoma cell lines. AdPGp53 conferred greatly enhanced levels of p53 protein and induction of the p53 target gene, p21, as well as superior cell killing by a mechanism consistent with apoptosis. DU145 cells were susceptible to induction of death with AdPGp53, yet PC3 cells were quite resistant. Though AdCMVp53 was shown to be reliable, extremely high-level expression of p53 offered by AdPGp53 was necessary for tumor suppressor activity in PC3 and DU145. In situ gene therapy experiments revealed tumor inhibition and increased overall survival in response to AdPGp53, but not AdCMVp53. Upon histologic examination, only AdPGp53 treatment was correlated with the detection of both p53 and TUNEL-positive cells.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is widely used as a tumor marker to screen for PC. Many studies have been performed to define the reference intervals (RIs) for total circulating PSA (tPSA). The results were different among different nations and races, even in the same race. Few researches have been performed on the RIs of free PSA (fPSA) and the ratio of free to total PSA (%fPSA). In this study, we aimed to simultaneously determine the age-specific RIs for tPSA, fPSA, and %fPSA in the healthy Han ethnic male.  Methods:   A total of 1862 apparently healthy male aged from 21 to 94 years were included in our study. Nonparametric 95th percentile intervals were used to define the RIs.  Results:   The reference limits in different age groups (21-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and â¥81 years) were 2.07, 3.59, 4.93, 6.83, and 7.73 ng/mL for tPSA, and 0.60, 0.76, 0.83, 1.30, and 2.41 ng/mL for fPSA. The RIs of %fPSA were â¥0.16 for 21-50 years and â¥0.13 for male over 50 years old.  Conclusions:   We established age-specific RIs for tPSA, fPSA and %fPSA. The newly established RIs should be more suitable for Chinese Han ethnic male.

Materials and methods:   Questionnaires that explored urologists' knowledge, frequency, and utilization of family history information for screening and treatment recommendations for PC were prospectively collected. Data were summarized and compared using descriptive statistics.  Results:   A total of 87 responses were collected, for a response rate of 60% (87 of 145). The majority of urologists reported that they always collect family history when discussing risk (95%) or screening (87%), and recommended earlier screening for men with family history of PC in comparison with men with no family history. Although only 57% reported always collecting family history when discussing treatment, the majority of respondents reported that a positive family history influenced their treatment recommendations. Eight percent of urologists would recommend prostatectomy for men diagnosed with low-grade, low-risk PC and no family history of PC vs 52% who would recommend the same course of treatment when the patient had at least 1 first-degree relative who died of the disease. Conversely, 91% of urologists would recommend active surveillance for men with low-grade, low-risk PC and no family history vs 47% for those with at least 1 first-degree relative who died of the disease.

We have previously shown that castration-resistant metastases express multiple SLCO transporters at significantly higher levels than primary PCa, suggesting that OATP-mediated steroid transport is biologically relevant in advanced disease. However, whether OATP-mediated steroid transport can actually modify prostate tumor androgen levels in vivo has never been demonstrated.  Methods:   We sought to determine whether OATP-mediated steroid transport can measurably alter PCa androgen levels in vivo. We evaluated the uptake of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS), E1S and testosterone in LNCaP cells engineered to express OATP1B1, 1B3, 2B1 or 4A1. We measured the uptake via administration of tritiated steroids to castrate mice bearing vector control or OATP1B1-, 2B1- or 4A1-expressing xenografts. We treated tumor-bearing mice with DHEAS and testosterone at physiologically relevant levels and measured intratumor accumulation of administered steroids by mass spectrometry.  Results:   OATP1B1- and 2B-expressing xenografts each showed a threefold increase in tritiated-DHEAS uptake vs vector controls (P=0.002 and P=0.036, respectively). At circulating DHEAS levels similar to those in abiraterone-treated men (~15 Î¼g dl-1), OATP1B1- and 2B1-expressing xenografts showed a 3.9-fold (P=0.057) and 1.9-fold (P=0.048) increase in tumor accumulation of DHEAS and a 1.6-fold (P=0.057) and 2.7-fold (P=0.095) increase in DHEA, respectively. At the substantial circulating testosterone levels found in eugonadal men, a consistent effect of OATP1B1, 2B1 or 4A1 on testosterone uptake in vivo was not detected.  Conclusions:   OATP transporters measurably alter DHEAS uptake and intratumor androgen levels in prostate tumors in vivo, even at circulating androgen levels achieved in abiraterone-treated patients. These novel data emphasize the continued need to inhibit ligand-mediated androgen receptor signaling in PCa tumors, and support prospective evaluation of studies designed to test inhibition of OATP-mediated DHEAS uptake and utilization.""","""['S M Green', 'A Kaipainen', 'K Bullock', 'A Zhang', 'J M Lucas', 'C Matson', 'W A Banks', 'E A Mostaghel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Association of prostate cancer SLCO gene expression with Gleason grade and alterations following androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Enhanced expression of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) in androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells: possible role of OATP1A2 in adaptive cell growth under androgen-depleted conditions.', 'Association of Tissue Abiraterone Levels and SLCO Genotype with Intraprostatic Steroids and Pathologic Response in Men with High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Minireview: SLCO and ABC transporters: a role for steroid transport in prostate cancer progression.', 'Intracrinology-revisited and prostate cancer.', 'The androgen-thyroid hormone crosstalk in prostate cancer and the clinical implications.', 'Effects of the SLCO1B1 A388G single nucleotide polymorphism on the development, clinical parameters, treatment, and survival of multiple myeloma cases in a Polish population.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'Components of the human-specific, p53-mediated ""kill switch"" tumor suppression mechanism are usurped by human tumors, creating the possibility of therapeutic exploitation.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.']"""

Objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of dutasteride 0.5 mg in PCa prevention among men with isolated HGPIN on biopsy.  Methods:   This prospective, randomized, phase III, open-label 3-year trial assessed dutasteride versus active surveillance in patients with HGPIN. Patients were randomized to dutasteride 0.5 mg daily or active surveillance. Per-protocol prostate biopsies were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months until cancer detection or study end. The primary end point was cancer-free survival (CFS). An intention-to-treat analysis was done for patients who underwent at least one per-protocol biopsy. An efficacy analysis was done for patients who completed the study. CFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis.  Results:   In total, 220 men were randomized (dutasteride, n = 107; surveillance, n = 113). PCa was detected in 47.6: 49.1 % in the surveillance group and 45.9 % in the treatment group (p = 0.66). The detected PCa differentiation by Gleason score (GS) was GS 6 in 76.9 %, GS 7 in 19.8 %, and GS â¥ 8 in 3.3 %, with no difference between groups. The 3-year PCa-free survival was 43.6 % in the surveillance and 49.6 % in the dutasteride group (log rank p = 0.57). Limitations include a relatively high non-adherence rate, open-label design, and baseline sextant biopsy scheme.

Traditionally, an indwelling urinary catheter remains in-situ to facilitate the healing process of the reconstructed VUA. Compromise or rupture of this anastomosis may lead to acute urinary leak and subsequent urinoma or stricture formation. This ex-vivo porcine model aims to evaluate VUA tensile strength using different suture techniques and catheter types.  Methods:   Male porcine bladders were obtained and prostatectomy was performed. The specimens were randomized and VUA were created using 3-point interrupted, 6-point interrupted or 6 point continuous 3-0 monocryl suture. 20Fr catheters were utilized, specifically varying manufacturers (A and B) and catheter balloon shapes (round versus oval). The VUA model was placed within a reproducible pulley system and graduated weights were applied until failure of the catheter balloon or the model VUA. Model failure was defined as either 'VUA rupture', 'Catheter passage through VUA' or 'catheter failure'.  Results:   Twenty consecutive porcine bladders were prepared, tested and utilized for analysis. VUA reconstructed with 3-point fixation was more likely to suffer VUA rupture (p=0.025) compared to 6-point interrupted or 6-point continuous VUA. Higher tensile pressure causing catheter balloon rupture (p=0.009) was observed for Manufacturer A. Catheters with oval-balloon shape were more likely to dislodge past the VUA without disruption of the anastomosis (p=0.002).  Conclusions:   During prostatectomy, anastomotic technique and catheter selection can significantly alter the tensile properties of the VUA.

The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies. In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival. We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses. SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values = 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.002). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values = 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 615 PCa patients referred to radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection at single tertiary-care center with at least one adverse feature (AF): preoperative prostate-specific antigen â¥ 20 ng/mL, pathologic Gleason score 8 to 10, and no organ-confined disease at final pathology (seminal vesicle involvement, positive surgical margins, and/or lymph node invasion). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival rates by stratifying patients into 3 risk categories according to the number of AFs (namely, 1, 2, and 3 AFs). Multivariable competing risk Cox regression analyses were used to assess CSM and other cause of mortality.  Results:   Significant differences were found in terms of preoperative and pathologic tumor characteristics, adjuvant therapies, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Men with 1 AF had higher CSM-free survival estimates compared to those with 2 and 3 AFs (92.8% vs. 84.2% vs. 27.7% at 10 years' follow-up, P < .001). Moreover, the presence of 3 AFs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.96), postoperative adjuvant treatment status (HR, 2.44), and time to BCR (HR, 0.96) were all independent predictors of CSM (P â¤ .04). Age at surgery and time to BCR were the only independent predictors of other causes of mortality (P â¤ .0009).

In this study, we have examined the role of the E6AP-PML axis in prostate cancer (PC). We show that knockdown (KD) of E6AP expression attenuates growth of PC cell lines in vitro. We validated this finding in vivo using cell line xenografts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse genetics. We found that KD of E6AP attenuates cancer cell growth by promoting cellular senescence in vivo, which correlates with restoration of tumor suppression by PML.

Using xenograft models, we showed that chronic behavioral stress and beta-adrenergic signaling promote angiogenesis and prostate cancer progression.

Here, we analyzed direct transcription programs of the AR in VCaP cells using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and integrated the GRO-seq data with the ARB and VCaP cell-specific TF-binding data.

Age, PSA, prostate volume (PV) and DRE were predictors included in our logistic regression model and used to construct two nomograms for overall prostate cancer and clinically-significant (Gleason sum â¥7) cancer detection. Predictive accuracies of our nomograms were assessed using area under curve (AUC) of their receiver-operator characteristic curves. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrap method. Our nomograms were compared to a model based on PSA alone using AUC and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Out of 672 men analyzed, our positive biopsy rate was 26.2% (n = 176), of which 63.6% (n = 112) had clinically significant disease. Age, PSA, PV and DRE status were all independent risk factors for both overall prostate cancer detection as well as clinically-significant cancer detection (all P < 0.05).

Agonist-induced activation of TRPV1 resulted in specific spatiotemporal patterns of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in breast and prostate cancer-derived cells. Capsaicin (CAPS; 50Î¼M) evoked intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and/or intercellular Ca2+ waves in all cell lines. As evidenced in prostate cancer Du 145 cells, oscillations were largely dependent on the expression of functional TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane, phospholipase C activation and on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ ions. Concomitant oscillations of the mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentration resulted in mitochondria energization evidenced by increased ATP production. CAPS-induced Ca2+ oscillations also occurred in a subset of sensory neurons, yet already at lower CAPS concentrations (1Î¼M). Stimulation of ectopically expressed TRPV1 channels in CAPS-insensitive NIH-3T3 cells didn't provoke CAPS-triggered Ca2+ oscillations; rather it resulted in low-magnitude, long-lasting elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This indicates that sole TRPV1 activation is not sufficient to generate Ca2+ oscillations. Instead the initial TRPV1-mediated signal leads to the activation of the inositol phospholipid pathway.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B17 (UGT2B17) is a key enzyme that maintains androgen homeostasis by catabolizing AR agonists into inactive forms. Although enhanced UGT2B17 expression by antiandrogens has been reported in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, its roles in regulating AR signaling transformation and CRPC progression remain unknown. In this study, we show that higher UGT2B17 protein expression in prostate tumors is associated with higher Gleason score, metastasis, and CRPC progression. UGT2B17 expression and activity were higher in androgen-independent compared to androgen-dependent cell lines. UGT2B17 stimulated cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and xenograft progression to CRPC after prolonged androgen deprivation. Gene microarray analysis indicated that UGT2B17 suppressed androgen-dependent AR transcriptional activity and enhanced of ligand-independent transcriptional activity at genes associated with cell mitosis. These UGT2B17 actions were mainly mediated by activation of the c-Src kinase. In CRPC tumors, UGT2B17 expression was associated positively with c-Src activation. These results indicate that UGT2B17 expedites CRPC progression by enhancing ligand-independent AR signaling to activate cell mitosis in cancer cells. Cancer Res; 76(22); 6701-11.

Given their pleiotropic roles in the control of transcription, coactivators have been implicated in a broad range of human disease states, including cancer. This is best typified by the three members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family, each of which integrates steroid hormone signaling and growth factor pathways to drive oncogenic gene expression programs in breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and other cancers. Because of this, coactivators represent emerging targets for cancer therapeutics, and efforts are now being made to develop SRC-targeting agents, such as the SI-2 inhibitor and the novel SRC stimulator, MCB-613, that are able to block cancer growth in cell culture and animal model systems.

Methods and materials:   In a prospective multicenter test cohort (n=865), EPIC-26 patient-reported HRQOL data were collected for 2 years after treatment from patients treated with prostate radiation therapy from 2003 to 2011. A second prospective multicenter cohort (n=442) was used for independent validation. A repeated-effects model was used to predict the change from baseline in bowel summary scores from longer EPIC instruments using the change in EPIC-CP bowel summary scores with and without rectal bleeding scores.  Results:   Two years after radiation therapy, 91% of patients were free of bleeding, and only 2.6% reported bothersome bleeding problems. Correlations between EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP bowel scores were very high (r2=0.90-0.96) and were statistically improved with the addition of rectal bleeding information (r2=0.94-0.98). Considering all patients, only 0.2% of patients in the test cohort and 0.7% in the validation cohort reported bothersome bleeding and had clinically relevant HRQOL changes missed with EPIC-CP. However, of the 2.6% (n=17) of men with bothersome rectal bleeding in the test cohort, EPIC-CP failed to capture 1 patient (6%) as experiencing meaningful declines in bowel HRQOL.  Conclusions:   Modern prostate radiation therapy results in exceptionally low rates of bothersome rectal bleeding, and <1% of patients experience bothersome bleeding and are not captured by EPIC-CP as having meaningful HRQOL declines after radiation therapy.

Our aim was to further investigate the relationship between prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and detection of suspected cancer recurrence using 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy, particularly at low PSA levels.  Methods:   This retrospective single tertiary referral institution cohort study of men reviewed the results of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans for investigation of post RP and post radiotherapy PSA recurrence following primary treatment of prostate cancer. We included men with suspected recurrent prostate cancer based on an elevated post treatment PSA level. The data collected analyzed the relationship of the pre-scan PSA level to the probability of a positive scan finding for recurrent prostate cancer.  Results:   Of the cohort of 532 men, 425 had a previous RP and 107 had prior radiotherapy. The median PSA of the RP group was 0.59 ng/mL and 5.8 ng/mL in the radiotherapy group. In the post RP cohort, the detection rate of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 11.3% for PSA 0.01 to <0.2 ng/mL, 26.6% for PSA 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL, 53.3% for PSA 0.5 to <1 ng/mL, 79.1% for PSA 1 to <2 ng/mL and 95.5% for PSA â¥2. Lymph node metastasis post RP was identified in 68% of men with suspected disease recurrence. In the post radiotherapy cohort the detection rate was 33.3% for PSA 0.01 to <0.5 ng/mL, 71.4% for PSA 0.5 to <1 ng/mL, 93.3% for PSA 1 to <2 ng/mL and 100% for PSA â¥2. Local recurrence after radiotherapy was suspected in 71% of the cohort and 40% had suspected lymph node metastasis.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is largest cohort study of detection rates of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence after definitive treatment of prostate cancer, including patients with PSA <0.5 and in a post radiotherapy cohort.

However, the role of operator specific factors remains inadequately defined. This study investigated the association of diagnostic outcome of TRUS guided biopsy with operator skill level. METHODS This study looked at a consecutive cohort of 690 men undergoing their first extended pattern TRUS guided prostate biopsy by 27 operators over a 24-month period in a single institution. Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Biopsies performed by consultants (odds ratio [OR]: 2.35, p=0.004) and senior trainees (OR: 2.37, p=0.002) in patients with prostate specific antigen levels of <10ng/ml were more likely to be positive than those performed by junior trainees (cancer detection rate 50.0%, 50.3% and 29.9% respectively). Furthermore, biopsies performed by junior trainees yielded a significantly higher proportion of prostate cancers with a Gleason score of â¥3+4 than those performed by senior trainees (OR: 2.11, p=0.031) and consultants (OR: 2.40, p=0.013) (81.4%, 67.5% and 64.6% respectively). No significant differences emerged between operator skill groups for complications, rebiopsy rates or the number of prostate cancers found during the follow-up period (median: 34 months) of patients with a negative biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Level of operator experience is associated with the diagnostic outcome of extended pattern TRUS guided biopsy.

Materials and methods:   2943 LRP cases were performed by nine Australian surgeons. The inclusion criteria were a prospectively collected database with a minimum of 100 consecutive LRP cases. The surgeons' LRP experience commenced at various times from July 2003 to September 2009. Data were analysed for demographic, peri-operative, oncological and functional outcomes.  Results:   The mean age of patients were 61.5 years and mean preoperative PSA 7.4 ng/ml. Mean operating time was 168 minutes with conversion to open surgery in 0.5% and a blood transfusion rate of 1.1%. Overall mean length of stay was 2.5 days. 73.6% of pathological specimens were pT2 and 86.3% had Gleason Score >7. Overall positive surgical margins (PSM) occurred in 15.9% with pT2 PSM 9.8%, pT3a PSM 30.8% and pT3b PSM 39.2%. Mean urinary continence at 12 months was 91.4% (data available from five surgeons). Mean 12 months potency after bilateral nerve spare was 47.2% (data available from four surgeons). Biochemical recurrence occurred in 10.6% (mean follow up 17 months).  Conclusion:   The Australian experience of Fellowship trained surgeons performing LRP demonstrates favourable peri-operative, oncological and functional outcomes in comparison to published data for open, laparoscopic and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.

Many previous studies harbored important methodological limitations.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based case-control study of PCa comprising 1933 cases and 1994 controls in Montreal, Canada. Lifetime alcohol consumption was elicited, by type of beverage, during in-person interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) assessed the association between alcohol intake and PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders and considering the subjects' PCa screening history.  Results:   We observed a weak, non-significant positive association between high consumption of total alcohol over the lifetime and risk of high-grade PCa (OR=1.18, 95% CI 0.81-1.73). Risk estimates were more pronounced among current drinkers (OR=1.40, 95%CI 1.00-1.97), particularly after adjusting for the timing of last PCa screening (OR=1.52, 95%CI 1.07-2.16). These associations were largely driven by beer consumption. The OR for high-grade PCa associated with high beer intake was 1.37 (95%CI 1.00-1.89); it was 1.49 (95%CI 0.99-2.23) among current drinkers and 1.68 (95% CI 1.10-2.57) after adjusting for screening recency. High cumulative consumption of spirits was associated with a lower risk of low-grade PCa (OR=0.75, 95%CI 0.60-0.94) but the risk estimate no longer achieved statistical significance when restricting to current users. No association was found for wine consumption.  Conclusion:   Findings add to the accumulating evidence that high alcohol consumption increases the risk of high-grade PCa.

Since mass spectrometry is so far not commonly used in clinical laboratories, we have here investigated whether antibody-based methods such as Western blot or ELISA can be used to validate the use of the identified proteins as prostate cancer biomarkers. Western blot experiments designed to detect flotillin 2, TMEM256, Rab3B and LAMTOR1 showed that the level of these proteins was higher in urinary exosomes from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy males. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve of flotillin 2 in samples from 16 controls and 16 patients showed an area under the curve of 0.91, and 88% sensitivity at a threshold set to give 94% specificity. In addition, ELISA-based detection of flotillin 2 and PARK7 showed that the combination of these proteins was able to distinguish prostate cancer patients and healthy controls with 68% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Several promising biomarkers identified by mass spectrometry could not be evaluated by Western blot or ELISA due to their low exosomal amount and/or lack of good antibodies.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts on all patients treated with external beam radiation therapy (minimum dose, 7560 cGy) for histologically confirmed prostate cancer at our institution from 2003 to 2011. Five hundred patients met these criteria; of these, 35 patients (7.0%) developed radiation proctitis necessitating intervention with APC. Indications for APC treatment were either the need for blood transfusions resulting from proctitis-related anemia or refractory bleeding despite medical management.  Results:   The median follow-up from the completion of radiation treatment was 78 months (range, 19-129) and the median follow up from the most recent APC treatment was 56 months (range, 3-112). Fifteen men (42.9%) needed blood transfusions because of proctitis-related anemia. For 19 patients (54.3%), bleeding was controlled after 1 or 2 treatments. Eventual bleeding control was obtained in 30 patients (85.7%). The median number of sessions per patient was 2 (range, 1-13). Post-APC ulceration was noted in 8 cases (22.9%). Two patients (5.7%) developed colovesicular fistulas, with 1 patient dying from this complication. A short interval between treatments (â¤35 days) was associated with an increased risk of ulcer or fistula formation.  Conclusions:   APC is an effective treatment for patients with medically refractive radiation proctitis after dose-escalated radiation therapy, frequently controlling bleeding after only one or two sessions.

We previously developed a 157-gene signature for Gleason score using a limited gene panel. Using a new whole-transcriptome expression dataset, we verified the previous signature's performance and developed a new Gleason signature to improve lethal outcome prediction among men with Gleason score 7.  Experimental design:   We generated mRNA expression data from prostate tumor tissue from men in the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (N = 404) using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray. The Prediction Analysis for Microarrays method was used to develop a signature to distinguish high (â¥8) versus low (â¤6) Gleason score. We evaluated the signature's ability to improve prediction of lethality among men with Gleason score 7, adjusting for 3 + 4/4 + 3 status, by quantifying the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).  Results:   We identified a 30-gene signature that best distinguished Gleason score â¤6 from â¥8. The AUC to predict lethal disease among Gleason score 7 men was 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67-0.84] compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.76) using 3 + 4/4 + 3 status alone (P = 0.0001).

Here, we examined whether BIRC6, an IAP family member, has a role in enzalutamide resistance of CRPCs and could provide a therapeutic target for enzalutamide-resistant CRPC.Experimental Design: Use of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC models: (i) the transplantable, first high-fidelity LTL-313BR patient-derived enzalutamide-resistant CRPC tissue xenograft line showing primary enzalutamide resistance, (ii) MR42D and MR49F CRPC cells/xenografts showing acquired enzalutamide resistance. Specific BIRC6 downregulation in these models was produced using a BIRC6-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-6w2). Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR and gene expression profiling. Molecular pathways associated with growth inhibition were assessed via gene enrichment analysis.Results: Of eight IAPs examined, BIRC6 was the only one showing elevated expression in both enzalutamide-resistant CRPC models. Treatment with ASO-6w2 markedly suppressed growth of LTL-313BR xenografts and increased tumor apoptosis without inducing major host toxicity. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that GPCR and matrisome signaling were the most significantly altered pathways. Furthermore, ASO-6w2 inhibited expression of prosurvival genes that were upregulated in the LTL-313BR line.Conclusions:BIRC6 targeting inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC models and may represent a new option for clinical treatment of advanced, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   MUSIC is a consortium of 42 practices that maintains a prospective clinical registry with validated clinical data on all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at participating sites. We identified all patients in MUSIC practices who entered active surveillance and had at least 2 years of continuous followup. After determining the frequency of repeat prostate specific antigen testing and prostate biopsy, we calculated rates of concordance with NCCN GuidelinesÂ® recommendations (ie at least 3 prostate specific antigen tests and 1 surveillance biopsy) collaborative-wide and across individual practices.  Results:   We identified 513 patients who entered active surveillance from January 2012 through September 2013 and had at least 2 years of followup. Among the 431 men (84%) who remained on active surveillance for 2 years 132 (30.6%) underwent followup surveillance testing at a frequency that was concordant with NCCNÂ® (National Comprehensive Cancer NetworkÂ®) recommendations. At the practice level, the median rate of guideline concordant followup was 26.5% (range 10% to 67.5%, p <0.001). Among patients with discordant followup, the absence of followup biopsy was common and not significantly different across practices (median rate 82.0%, p = 0.35).  Conclusions:   Among diverse community and academic practices in Michigan, there is wide variation in the proportion of men on active surveillance who meet guideline recommendations for followup prostate specific antigen testing and repeat biopsy. These data highlight the need for standardized active surveillance pathways that emphasize the role of repeat surveillance biopsies.""","""['Amy N Luckenbaugh', 'Gregory B Auffenberg', 'Scott R Hawken', 'Apoorv Dhir', 'Susan Linsell', 'Sanjeev Kaul', 'David C Miller;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Contemporary use of initial active surveillance among men in Michigan with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance as Initial Management of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: Data from the PURC.', 'Understanding the Performance of Active Surveillance Selection Criteria in Diverse Urology Practices.', 'Avoiding obsolescence in advanced prostate cancer management: a guide for urologists.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'A vision for closing the evidence-practice gap in the management of low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Time Trends and Variation in the Use of Active Surveillance for Management of Low-risk Prostate Cancer in the US.', 'Development and External Validation of the STRATified CANcer Surveillance (STRATCANS) Multivariable Model for Predicting Progression in Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Starting Active Surveillance.', 'Primary Care Physician Perspectives on Low Risk Prostate Cancer Management: Results of a National Survey.']"""

So, early and sensitive diagnosis of cancer is very important before it spreads out to the other organs of the body. It is well-known that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most specific and efficient tumor marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Herein, we successfully fabricated core-shell composite fluorescent nanoparticle Ag@SiO2@SiO2-RuBpy which provide a photoluminescence enhancement of up to ~3-fold when the separation distance between the surface of silver core and the center of the third RuBpy doped silica shell is about 10nm. These core-shell MEF-capable nanoparticles have obvious advantages. The interaction between the doped RuBpy molecules in the outer silica layer and the silver core, greatly improves the excitation efficiency and enhances the fluorescence intensity. Importantly, the presence of silica can reduce the self-quenching of RuBpy, which makes larger amounts of RuBpy incorporated into the silica shell. In addition, the shell protects the RuBpy against collisional quenching and irreversible photodegradation and provides abundant hydroxyl for easy conjugation. After that a highly sensitive, specific and reliable strategy based on metal-enhanced fluorescence and magnetic separation was applied for the detection of PSA in both buffer and serum. The process could be rapidly accomplished, in which the immunomagnetic nanospheres (IMNs) and immunofluorescent nanoparticles (IFNs) were used to capture and identify the target molecules simultaneously. A good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PSA (0.1-100ng/mL) with a detection limit 27pg/mL was obtained.""","""['Dang-Dang Xu', 'Yun-Liang Deng', 'Cheng-Yu Li', 'Yi Lin', 'Hong-Wu Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Target-triggered signal turn-on detection of prostate specific antigen based on metal-enhanced fluorescence of Ag@SiO2@SiO2-RuBpy composite nanoparticles.', 'Metal enhanced fluorescence solution-based sensing platform 2: fluorescent core-shell Ag@SiO2 nanoballs.', 'Label-free fluorescence turn-on aptasensor for prostate-specific antigen sensing based on aggregation-induced emission-silica nanospheres.', 'Functionalized silica nanoparticles: a platform for fluorescence imaging at the cell and small animal levels.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensing of prostate specific antigen (PSA): Recent progress and challenges in efficient diagnosis of prostate cancer using biomedicine.', 'AgPdNFs and AuNOs@GO nanocomposites for T-2 toxin detection by catalytic hairpin assembly.', 'Recent progress in sensing application of metal nanoarchitecture-enhanced fluorescence.', 'Surface modification of plasmonic noble metal-metal oxide core-shell nanoparticles.', 'Plasmonic Fluorescence Enhancement in Diagnostics for Clinical Tests at Point-of-Care: A Review of Recent Technologies.', 'Magnetic Nanoparticle Composites: Synergistic Effects and Applications.']"""

Evolving clinical data have supported expanding surveillance as a means to ""right-size"" treatment. Integrated delivery systems afford the possibility of hastening this objective.  Study design:   Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries.  Methods:   We used a 20% sample of national Medicare claims to assess the impact of healthcare integration on rates of treatment and potential overtreatment in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. Rates were measured according to the extent of integration within a market (ie, none, low, intermediate, and high). Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship between integration and utilization, adjusting for confounders.  Results:   Rates of treatment declined across all markets (P <.01 for overall time trend), but the rate of decline was similar for the 4 market types (P = .27). In the most integrated markets, the rate decreased by 28.8%, or from 55.5 per 10,000 population in 2007 to 39.5 per 10,000 in 2011. After adjusting for confounders, men residing in the most integrated markets were 2.1% less likely to be treated with curative intent compared with those living in areas without integrated delivery systems (P = .04). However, rates of potential overtreatment were similar across all markets regardless of the level of integration (P = .21).  Conclusions:   Healthcare integration was associated with small declines in prostate cancer treatment in newly diagnosed men, but not with potential overtreatment.

A total of 37,924 ever users of sitagliptin and 426,276 never users were followed until December 31, 2011. The treatment effect of sitagliptin (for ever versus never users, and for tertiles of cumulative duration of therapy) was estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score. Analyses were also conducted in a 1:1 matched pair cohort based on 8 digits of propensity score. Results showed that during follow-up, 84 ever users and 2,549 never users were diagnosed of prostate cancer, representing an incidence of 140.74 and 240.17 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.

Methods: Sixty-three patients with a median age of 73 y who underwent 307 cycles of therapy with 223RaCl2 were analyzed. In 31 patients, bone scanning and radiologic imaging were performed for pretherapeutic imaging (group 1). In 32 patients, bone scanning and PSMA PET were performed before therapy (group 2). Patients with small lymph node metastases and local recurrence were not excluded from treatment, consistent with current guidelines. PSA and ALP were measured before each treatment cycle and 4 wk after the final cycle. Thirteen patients from group 2, who underwent a second PSMA PET scan as a follow-up, were evaluated to determine the significance of PSA changes as a follow-up marker. Results: In group 1, 4 patients (12.9%) showed a PSA decline, of whom 2 patients and 1 patient showed a PSA decline of more than 30% and more than 50%, respectively. In contrast, in group 2, 14 patients (43.8%) showed a PSA decline, of whom 10 and 8 patients showed a decline of more than 30% and more than 50%, respectively (P = 0.007). Thirty-seven patients had a high ALP level (19 from group 1 and 18 from group 2). Twelve (63.2%) and 16 (88.9%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, showed an ALP decline. This difference was not significant; however, 7 (36%) and 13 (72.2%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, showed an ALP decline of more than 30% (P = 0.04). Considering any ALP decline as a response, no patient with increasing ALP showed a PSA response (P = 0.036). There was a significant correlation between the PSA changes and the therapeutic response according to follow-up PSMA PET.

We aimed to estimate the absorbed doses for normal organs and tumor lesions using 177Lu-PSMA I&T (I&T is imaging and therapy) in patients undergoing up to 4 cycles of radioligand therapy. Results were compared with pretherapeutic Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[68Ga(HBEDCC)] (68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) PET. Methods: A total of 34 cycles in 18 patients were analyzed retrospectively. In 15 patients the first, in 9 the second, in 5 the third, and in 5 the fourth cycle was analyzed, respectively. Whole-body scintigraphy was performed at least between 30-120 min, 24 h, and 6-8 d after administration. Regions of interest covering the whole body, organs, and up to 4 tumor lesions were drawn. Organ and tumor masses were derived from pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT. Absorbed doses for individual cycles were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. SUVs from pretherapeutic PET were compared with absorbed doses and with change of SUV. Results: The mean whole-body effective dose for all cycles was 0.06 Â± 0.03 Sv/GBq. The mean absorbed organ doses were 0.72 Â± 0.21 Gy/GBq for the kidneys; 0.12 Â± 0.06 Gy/GBq for the liver; and 0.55 Â± 0.14 Gy/GBq for the parotid, 0.64 Â± 0.40 Gy/GBq for the submandibular, and 3.8 Â± 1.4 Gy/GBq for the lacrimal glands. Absorbed organ doses were relatively constant among the 4 different cycles. Tumor lesions received a mean absorbed dose per cycle of 3.2 Â± 2.6 Gy/GBq (range, 0.22-12 Gy/GBq). Doses to tumor lesions gradually decreased, with 3.5 Â± 2.9 Gy/GBq for the first, 3.3 Â± 2.5 Gy/GBq for the second, 2.7 Â± 2.3 Gy/GBq for the third, and 2.4 Â± 2.2 Gy/GBq for the fourth cycle. SUVs of pretherapeutic PET moderately correlated with absorbed dose (r = 0.44, P < 0.001 for SUVmax; r = 0.43, P < 0.001 for SUVmean) and moderately correlated with the change of SUV (r = 0.478, P < 0.001 for SUVmax, and r = 0.50, P < 0.001 for SUVmean).

We previously reported that Arrest-defective protein 1 (ARD1) is an oncoprotein in prostate cancer. It acetylates and activates AR to promote prostate tumorigenesis. However, the ARD1-targeted residue within AR and the mechanisms of the acetylation event in prostate tumorigenesis remained unknown. In this study, we show that ARD1 acetylates AR at lysine 618 (K618) in vitro and in vivo. An AR construct with the charged lysine substitution by arginine (AR-618R) reduces RNA Pol II binding, AR transcriptional activity, prostate cancer cell growth, and xenograft tumor formation due to attenuation of AR nuclear translocation, whereas, construct mimicking neutral polar substitution acetylation at K618 by glutamine (AR-618Q) enhanced these effects beyond that of the wild-type AR. Mechanistically, ARD1 forms a ternary complex with AR and HSP90 in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ARD1 increases levels of AR acetylation and AR-HSP90 dissociation in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, the AR acetylation defective K618R mutant is unable to dissociate from HSP90 while the HSP90-dissociated AR is acetylated following ligand exposure. This work identifies a new mechanism for ligand-induced AR-HSP90 dissociation and AR activation.

Although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating EMT and the CSC phenotype, little is known of how these processes are regulated by epigenetics. Here we demonstrate that reduced expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the induction of EMT and the CSC phenotype by prostate cancer (PCa) cells, with enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis. First, we observed that reduction of DNMT1 by 5-azacitidine (5-Aza) promotes EMT induction as well as CSCs and sphere formation in vitro. Reduced expression of DNMT1 significantly increased PCa migratory potential. We showed that the increase of EMT and CSC activities by reduction of DNMT1 is associated with the increase of protein kinase C. Furthermore, we confirmed that silencing DNMT1 is correlated with enhancement of the induction of EMT and the CSC phenotype in PCa cells. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveals that reduction of DNMT1 promotes the suppression of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 on the Zeb2 and KLF4 promoter region in PCa cells. Critically, we found in an animal model that significant tumor growth and more disseminated tumor cells in most osseous tissues were observed following injection of 5-Aza pretreated-PCa cells compared with vehicle-pretreated PCa cells. Our results suggest that epigenetic alteration of histone demethylation regulated by reduction of DNMT1 may control induction of EMT and the CSC phenotype, which facilitates tumorigenesis in PCa cells and has important therapeutic implications in targeting epigenetic regulation.""","""['Eunsohl Lee', 'Jingcheng Wang', 'Kenji Yumoto', 'Younghun Jung', 'Frank C Cackowski', 'Ann M Decker', 'Yan Li', 'Renny T Franceschi', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Russell S Taichman']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor ZEB1/ZEB2 co-expression predicts poor prognosis and maintains tumor-initiating properties in head and neck cancer.', 'Reduction of two histone marks, H3k9me3 and H3k27me3 by epidrug induces neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Multifaceted Roles of DNA Methylation in Neoplastic Transformation, from Tumor Suppressors to EMT and Metastasis.', 'MicroRNA control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer stem cells.', 'Epigenetic regulation of hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell states in cancer.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'The Emerging Role of Epigenetics in Metabolism and Endocrinology.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'High-Throughput Cellular Heterogeneity Analysis in Cell Migration at the Single-Cell Level.']"""

The role of CTC in localized disease has been addressed by only few studies. However, results of CTC analyses are strongly dependent on the platform used for CTC enrichment and detection. In the present study, a microfluidic platform allowing for antigen-independent enrichment of CTC was investigated for its ability to detect CTC in patients with clinically localized PC.  Patients and methods:   Blood (2ml) was collected preoperatively from 50 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized PC. CTC were enriched using a microfluidic ratchet mechanism allowing separation of CTC from white blood cells based on differences in size and deformability. Enriched cells were stained for immunofluorescence with antibodies targeting pancytokeratin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and CD45. In 21 patients, we performed staining for the androgen receptor. CTC counts were correlated with clinical and pathological parameters using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for continuous parameters and Chi-square test for categorical parameters.  Results:   CTC were detected in 25 (50%) patients. The median number of CTC in CTC-positive patients was 9 CTC/2ml (range: 1-417). Pancytokeratin positive CTC showed expression of androgen the receptor. We observed no correlation between CTC counts and prostate-specific antigen concentration, tumor stage, lymph node stage, or Gleason grade.  Conclusion:   In a representative cohort of patients with clinically localized PC, CTC can be detected in a considerable proportion of patients when using a new microfluidic ratchet mechanism.

Materials and methods:   In this nationwide retrospective observational study based on the data from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database (KNCIDB), this study analyzed the age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and annual percentage changes (APCs) of kidney, bladder, prostate, testicular, and penile cancers as well as cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter between 1999 and 2012. The relative survival rates (RSRs) were calculated for urological cancer patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 from the KNCIDB data.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 66,812 individuals followed by bladder (41,549) and kidney (36,836) cancers. The overall ASR (18.26 per 100,000) increased with age because of the higher ASRs of bladder and prostate cancers in the elderly. The ASR for kidney cancer was highest in the 40-59-year-old group, whereas testicular cancer occurred most frequently before the age of 40. The incidence of most urological cancers increased (overall APC, 6.39%; p < 0.001), except for penile (APC, -2.01%; p=0.05) and bladder (APC, -0.40%; p=0.25) cancers. The overall survival increased steadily (5-year RSR, 66.4% in 1993-1995 vs. 84.2% in 2008-2012; p < 0.001), particularly for prostate (by 34.10%) and kidney (by 16.30%) cancers, but not for renal pelvis and ureter cancers (-7.20%).

This study analyzed real-world data on PSA ordering and referral practices in the years surrounding the recommendation.  Methods:   A whole-institution sample of entered PSA orders and urology referrals was obtained from the electronic medical record. The study was performed at a tertiary referral center with a catchment in the southern United States. PSA examinations were defined as screening when they were ordered by providers with appointments in internal medicine, family medicine, or general internal medicine. Linear and quadratic regression analyses were performed, and joinpoint regression was used to assess for trend inflection points.  Results:   Between January 2010 and July 2015, there were 275,784 unique ambulatory visits for men. There were 63,722 raw PSA orders, and 54,684 were evaluable. Primary care providers ordered 17,315 PSA tests and 858 urology referrals. The number of PSA tests per ambulatory visit, the number of referrals per ambulatory visit, the age at the time of the urology referral, and the proportion of PSA tests performed outside the recommended age range did not significantly change. The PSA value at the time of referral increased significantly (P = .022). Joinpoint analysis revealed no joinpoints in the analysis of total PSA orders, screening PSA tests, or examinations per 100 visits.  Conclusions:   In the years surrounding the USPSTF recommendation, PSA behavior did not change significantly. Patients were referred at progressively higher average PSA levels.

Methods:   Notch pathway signal related proteins Notch 1, Jagged-1 and NICD were detected using Western blotting and RT-PCR. The proliferation and apoptosis were determined by MTT method and Elisa kits after curcumin treatment, respectively. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was carried out to confirm that curcumin could target Notching signaling. In order to study whether Notch 1 expression could be downregulated by curcumin, Notch 1 siRNA and Notch 1 plasmid were used in Notch 1 down-regulation and over-expression. The effects of curcumin on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis related proteins expression were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blotting, separately.  Results:   We found that Notch 1 signaling was down regulated in Notch 1 siRNA or Notch 1 plasmid transfected 145 cells after curcumin treatment. Curcumin induced G0/G1 arrest in DU-145 cells, and G0/G1 phase related regulatory factors Cyclin D1 and CDK2 expressions were inhibited. Meanwhile, p21 and p27 were up regulated.

However, measuring SES retrospectively presents challenges. Parental occupation on the birth certificate is a novel method of ascertaining early-life SES that has not been applied in cancer epidemiology.  Methods:   For a Baby-Boom cohort born from 1945-1959 in two Utah counties, individual-level Nam-Powers SES (Np-SES) was derived from parental industry/occupation reported on birth certificates. Neighborhood SES was estimated from average household income of census tract at birth. Cancer incidence was determined by linkage to Utah Cancer Registry records through the Utah Population Database. Hazard ratios (HR) for cancer risk by SES quartile were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Females with low Np-SES at birth had lower risk of breast cancer compared with those in the highest Np-SES group [HRQ1/Q4 = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.97; HRQ2/Q4 = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96]. Np-SES was inversely associated with melanoma (HRQ1/Q4 = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98) and prostate cancer (HRQ1/Q4 = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88). Women born into lower SES neighborhoods had significantly increased risk for invasive cervical cancer (HRQ1/Q4 = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85; HRQ2/Q4 = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Neighborhood SES had similar effects for melanoma and prostate cancers, but was not associated with female breast cancer. We found no association with SES for pancreas, lung, and colon and rectal cancers.  Conclusions:   Individual SES derived from parental occupation at birth was associated with altered risk for several cancer sites.

A fraction of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are invasive cancer cells which mediate metastasis by intravasation, survival and extravasation from the blood stream to metastatic sites. CTCs have been cleared by the FDA for use as surrogate markers of overall survival and progression free survival for breast, prostate and colorectal cancers using the CellSearchÂ® system. However, the clinical significance of CTCs in head and neck cancer patients has yet to be determined. There has been a significant shift in CTC enrichment platforms, away from exclusively single marker selection, to epitope-independent systems.  Methods:   The aim of this study was to screen advanced stage HNC patients by the CellSearchÂ® platform and utilise two other epitope-independent approaches, ScreenCellÂ® (microfiltration device) and RosetteSepâ¢ (negative enrichment), to determine how a shift to such methodologies would enable CTC enrichment and detection.  Results:   In advanced stage HNC patients, single CTCs were detected in 8/43 (18.6%) on CellSearchÂ®, 13/28 (46.4%) on ScreenCellÂ® and 16/25 (64.0%) by RosetteSepâ¢ (the latter could also detect CTC clusters). Notably, in patients with suspicious lung nodules, too small to biopsy, CTCs were found upon presentation. Moreover, CTCs were readily detected in advanced stage HNC patients.

However, the role of ofCS in cancer is largely unknown. The function of ofCS in cancer was analyzed using the recombinant ofCS-binding VAR2CSA protein (rVAR2) derived from the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum We demonstrate that ofCS plays a key role in tumor cell motility by affecting canonical integrin signaling pathways. Binding of rVAR2 to tumor cells inhibited the interaction of cells with extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which correlated with decreased phosphorylation of Src kinase. Moreover, rVAR2 binding decreased migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells in vitro Mass spectrometry of ofCS-modified proteoglycan complexes affinity purified from tumor cell lines on rVAR2 columns revealed an overrepresentation of proteins involved in cell motility and integrin signaling, such as integrin-Î²1 (ITGB1) and integrin-Î±4 (ITGA4). Saturating concentrations of rVAR2 inhibited downstream integrin signaling, which was mimicked by knockdown of the core chondroitin sulfate synthesis enzymes Î²-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1) and chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGALNACT1). The ofCS modification was highly expressed in both human and murine metastatic lesions in situ and preincubation or early intravenous treatment of tumor cells with rVAR2 inhibited seeding and spreading of tumor cells in mice. This was associated with a significant increase in survival of the animals. These data functionally link ofCS modifications with cancer cell motility and further highlights ofCS as a novel therapeutic cancer target.

As a member of the solute carrier family, ZIP9/SLC39A9 is overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer and affects B-cell receptor signaling. Here, we present data indicating that changes in intracellular zinc levels in glioblastoma cells can cause enhanced cell survival and cell migration, both hallmarks of the disease process. In particular, treatment of human glioblastoma cells with sublethal doses of cell-permeable heavy metal (Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+) chelator (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN)) induced ZIP9 expression. Either TPEN treatment or expression of ZIP9 cDNA causes enhanced migration behavior of glioblastoma cells. Compared to untreated glioblastoma cells TPEN treatment or expression of ZIP9 results in activation of the tumor suppressor p53 by phosphorylation at serine residue 46 (Ser46) and in inactivation of the migration relevant glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3Î²) by phosphorylation at serine residue 9 (Ser9). Whilst p53 activation affects cell survival in response to TPEN, GSK-3Î² inactivation directly affects glioblastoma cell migration. Therefore, ZIP9 expression could regulate the migratory behavior of glioblastoma cells, so that ZIP9 may be of biological, but not of clinical relevance for glioblastomas, since in GBM tumor tissues, ZIP9 expression is not significantly increased compared to normal brain.""","""['Nico MÃ¼nnich', 'Simon Wernhart', 'Christer Hogstrand', 'Uwe Schlomann', 'Christopher Nimsky', 'JÃ¶rg W Bartsch']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biometals""","""['Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: II.

Core cross-linking by incorporating a disulfide bridge is a useful approach to improving the in vivo stability of polymeric micelles. This paper aims to investigate the effects of different degrees of cross-linking on the antitumor efficacy of micelles formed by poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate)-b-poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) (POEGMEA-b-PCEA-PTX) block copolymer. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) in vitro prostate tumor cell models were used to evaluate the un-cross-linked and cross-linked micelles. The cytotoxicity decreased with an increase in the degree of cross-linking upon being tested with 2D cultured cells, and all micelles remained less cytotoxic than free PTX. In the 3D prostate MCTS model, however, there was no statistical difference between the performance of un-cross-linked micelles and free PTX, while increasing cross-linking densities led to significantly relevant decreases in the antitumor efficacy of micelles. These results are contradictory to our previous research using an irreversible cross-linker (1,8-diaminooctane) to stabilize POEGMEA-b-PCEA-PTX conjugate micelles where it was shown that cross-linking accelerates and improves the effects of the micelles when compared to those of un-cross-linked micelles.

Materials and methods:   Between 2009 and 2013, 205 patients with biopsy-confirmed PCa had MRI before prostatectomy. BCR was defined as a PSA failure (>0.2 ng/ml) after prostatectomy. MR features (cancer location, diameter, apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs], PI-RADS v2 score, dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] type, and MR T-stage) were retrospectively evaluated for predicting 3-year BCR based on partial least square regression analysis. Second, imaging features were added to a popularized D'Amico and CAPRA scheme to determine imaging contribution to published nomograms. Lastly, a multivariable Cox regression analysis was employed to determine the independent risk factors of time to BCR.  Results:   Three-year BCR rate (median follow-up of 44.9 mo) was 25.4% (52/205).

In this respect, we investigated the seroprevalence and specificity of anti-SOX1 antibodies in a large cohort of neurological disorders.  Methods:   Overall, serum samples of 1493 consecutive patients were screened for anti-SOX1 reactivity by an ELISA: 471 with well-defined neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy), 185 with polyneuropathy (PNP) of unknown origin, and 837 with neurological syndromes of suspicious paraneoplastic etiology.

However, few studies have examined the urologist-level variation in the use of observation across all risk strata of prostate cancer.  Objectives:   To measure variation in the use of observation at the urologist level by disease risk strata and to evaluate the association between the urologist-level rates of observation for men with low-risk and high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   With the use of linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, a population-based study of men diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009, was performed in SEER catchment areas of the United States. A total of 57 639 men with prostate cancer with 1884 diagnosing urologists were identified. Data were analyzed from October 1 to December 31, 2015.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcome was observation, which is defined as the absence of definitive treatment within 1 year of diagnosis. In each risk stratum, a multivariable mixed-effects model was fit to characterize associations between observation and selected patient characteristics. From these models, the estimated probability of observation was calculated for each urologist within each risk stratum, and the association between the physician-level estimated rates of observation for low-risk and high-risk disease was assessed.  Results:   Among the 57 639 men included in the study, the estimated probability of observation for low-risk disease varied impressively (mean, 27.8%; range, 5.1%-71.2%) at the individual urologist level. Considerably less urologist-level variation was seen in the use of observation for intermediate-risk disease (11.1%; range, 4.8%-31.5%) and high-risk disease (5.8%; range, 3.2%-16.5%). Furthermore, the estimated rates of observation for low- and high-risk disease were correlated at the urologist level (Spearman Ï = 0.17; P < .001). A comparable correlation was likewise observed among urologists with high-volume prostate cancer practices (Spearman Ï = 0.24; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   Considerable urologist-level variation is seen in the use of observation for men with low-risk prostate cancer. More important, the use of observation for low-risk and high-risk patients with prostate cancer is correlated at the urologist level.

While sphingolipids suppress tumor growth by downregulating nutrient transporters, macropinocytosis and autophagy still provide cancer cells with fuel. Therapeutics that simultaneously disrupt these parallel nutrient access pathways have potential as powerful starvation agents. Here, we describe a water-soluble, orally bioavailable synthetic sphingolipid, SH-BC-893, that triggers nutrient transporter internalization and also blocks lysosome-dependent nutrient generation pathways. SH-BC-893 activated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to mislocalization of the lipid kinase PIKfyve. The concomitant mislocalization of the PIKfyve product PI(3,5)P2 triggered cytosolic vacuolation and blocked lysosomal fusion reactions essential for LDL, autophagosome, and macropinosome degradation. By simultaneously limiting access to both extracellular and intracellular nutrients, SH-BC-893 selectively killed cells expressing an activated form of the anabolic oncogene Ras in vitro and in vivo. However, slower-growing, autochthonous PTEN-deficient prostate tumors that did not exhibit a classic Warburg phenotype were equally sensitive. Remarkably, normal proliferative tissues were unaffected by doses of SH-BC-893 that profoundly inhibited tumor growth.

However, a limited number of studies have been performed on the antitumor effect of diosgenin on prostate cancer, the underlying mechanism of which remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect and underlying mechanism of diosgenin on DU145 human prostate cancer cells was investigated. DU145 cells were cultured in vitro with diosgenin, following which cell proliferation was detected by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. In addition, DU145 cells were observed under a transmission electron microscope to confirm autophagy. monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting indicated the levels of autophagy in DU145 cells. To determine the mechanism underlying the effect of diosgenin on DU145 cells, western blotting was performed to evaluate the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. To investigate the association between apoptosis and autophagy, DU145 cells were cultured with diosgenin and 3âmethyladenine.

Diosgenin inhibits the proliferation of DU145 cells by activating apoptosis and autophagy, and the mechanism underlying this activation may be associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, the inhibition of autophagy mediated by diosgenin increases apoptosis and, thus, increases the therapeutic effect.

Aim:   To compare sexual function in patients with prostate cancer treated with 78 Gy in 39 fractions of 2 Gy or 64.6 Gy in 19 fractions of 3.4 Gy.  Methods:   In total, 820 men with intermediate- to high-risk T1b-T4NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer were enrolled in the phase III HYPRO trial (2007-2010) and randomized to conventional fractionation (39 Ã 2 Gy) or hypofractionation (19 Ã 3.4 Gy). Sexual function was assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For this analysis, patients (n = 322) with a baseline assessment, at least one follow-up assessment, and no or short-term (6-month) androgen-deprivation therapy were included.  Main outcome measures:   Mean IIEF domain scores were compared between treatments in the total population and the hormone-naÃ¯ve population (n = 197) using the independent t-test. Incidences of severe erectile dysfunction (domain score < 11) at last follow-up were calculated in patients with partial or full baseline function. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied to calculate the odds ratio of hypofractionation vs conventional fractionation and to adjust for clinical factors.  Results:   Median age was 71 years (interquartile range = 67-71) and median follow-up was 37 months (interquartile range = 25-38). Androgen-deprivation therapy was prescribed in 125 (39%). IIEF domain scores decreased after treatment but were comparable between treatment arms at baseline and during follow-up. Orgasmic function scores in hormone-naÃ¯ve patients were significantly higher at 3 years after hypofractionation (4.08 vs 2.65, P = .031). In patients (n = 120) with partial or full baseline erectile function, the incidence of erectile dysfunction at last follow-up was 34.4% for hypofractionated treatment vs 39.3% for conventional treatment (adjusted odds ratio = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.37-1.90, P = .67).

While initially effective, recurrent tumors ultimately arise for which there is no durable cure. Despite the dependence of PCa on AR activity throughout the course of disease, delineation of the AR-dependent transcriptional network that governs disease progression remains elusive, and the function of AR in mitotically active cells is not well understood. Analyzing AR activity as a function of cell cycle revealed an unexpected and highly expanded repertoire of AR-regulated gene networks in actively cycling cells. New AR functions segregated into two major clusters: those that are specific to cycling cells and retained throughout the mitotic cell cycle ('Cell Cycle Common'), versus those that were specifically enriched in a subset of cell cycle phases ('Phase Restricted'). Further analyses identified previously unrecognized AR functions in major pathways associated with clinical PCa progression. Illustrating the impact of these unmasked AR-driven pathways, dihydroceramide desaturase 1 was identified as an AR-regulated gene in mitotically active cells that promoted pro-metastatic phenotypes, and in advanced PCa proved to be highly associated with development of metastases, recurrence after therapeutic intervention and reduced overall survival.

However, little information was available in Chinese population. We performed a genome-wide complex trait analysis for common cancers at nine anatomical sites in Chinese population (14,629 cancer cases vs. 17,554 controls) and estimated the heritability of these cancers based on the common SNPs. We found that common SNPs explained certain amount of heritability with significance for all nine cancer sites: gastric cancer (20.26%), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (19.86%), colorectal cancer (16.30%), lung cancer (LC) (15.17%), and epithelial ovarian cancer (13.31%), and a similar heritability around 10% for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We found that nearly or less than 25% change was shown when removing the regions expanding 250 kb or 500 kb upward and downward of the GWAS-reported SNPs. We also found strong linear correlations between variance partitioned by each chromosome and chromosomal length only for LC (R2 = 0.641, p = 0.001) and esophageal squamous cell cancer (R2 = 0.633, p = 0.002), which implied us the complex heterogeneity of cancers.

Methods:   Between September 2008 and January 2016, 712 patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP; 614 LRP and 98 RARP). Recovery of incontinence was evaluated through a 24-h pad test. Urinary and erectile function was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the International Index of Erectile Function-5. Follow-up interval was 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. The propensity score matching was used to balance the preoperative characteristics.  Results:   The recovery of incontinence was similar to the two groups at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. However, patients underwent RARP restored the continence sooner than those in the LRP group in 1 and 3 months after the surgery (P < 0.001 and 0.001). For the multivariable analysis, the type of RP procedure was a uniquely meaningful contributing factor (P = 0.001, HR = 1.925; 95% CI, 1.299-2.851). In the case of urinary function, the RARP groups showed a better IPSS score than LRP groups at the 1-, 3- and 6-month visits, respectively (P = 0.008, 0.026, 0.001), and the RARP groups early improved compared with LRP groups at the 3-month visit in the case of erectile function (P = 0.018).

Treatment variations in men with prostate cancer (PCa) among the various racial groups in the United States exist, which may be a source of potential disparity in outcome.  Methods:   Utilizing Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 17, we identified 327,636 men diagnosed with PCa from 2004 to 2011. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association of receiving definitive treatment and race in the context of disease severity.  Results:   African American (AA) and Hispanic men were less likely to receive treatment compared to White men (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71, 0.75, and OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92, 0.98, respectively). AA men had significantly lower OR of receiving definitive treatment within each D'Amico risk classification compared to White men, with decreasing odds of treatment for each increase in risk category (low-risk OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.78, 0.85; intermediate-risk OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.71, 0.77; and high-risk OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.58, 0.66).

Asian men had similar or greater odds of receiving treatment compared to White men within any Gleason or D'Amico classification.  Conclusion:   There is a significant disparity in the receipt of treatment for PCa among AA and Hispanic men compared to White men.

Material and methods:   Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) experiments at 3T in a cohort of 38 patients with PCa (fifty lesions in total) were performed, by using different diffusion weights (b values) up to 2500s/mm(2). Gleason score (GS) and GG data were correlated with DTI parameters (MD and FA) estimated in PCa. The relation between DTI measures and GS was tested by the linear correlation analysis (Pearson's coefficient). One-way analysis of variance to check the statistical significance of the difference between GG 1&2 and GGs 3, 4, 5, â¥3 was used. Results were reported for each of the three b-values ranges: 0-800s/mm(2), 0-1500s/mm(2), 0-2500s/mm(2).  Results:   A negative correlation was found between MD and GS. The highest linear correlation was observed when the fit was performed with data acquired in the b-values range 0-2500s/mm(2). MD values were significantly different between GG 1&2 and GG=3 and between GG 1&2 and GG â¥3. Moreover this difference is better defined when high b values (higher than b=800s/mm(2)) are used. The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy in the discrimination between GG 1&2 and GG=3 were: 90%, 66.7% and 82.4%, respectively when MD was estimated in the b-values range 0-2500s/mm(2) while these values were 85%, 58.3% and 78.4% when MD was estimated in the b-values range 0-800s/mm(2). Conversely FA did not discriminate between GG 1&2 and GG â¥3, at any investigated b-values range.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that MD estimation in PCa, obtained from DTI acquired at high b-values, can contribute to the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer while FA is not a useful parameter for this purpose.""","""['M Nezzo', 'M G Di Trani', 'A Caporale', 'R Miano', 'A Mauriello', 'P Bove', 'S Capuani', 'G Manenti']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Performance of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Discriminating Between Benign Tissue, Low and High Gleason Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Using the Ratio of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Measures.', 'Detection of high GS risk group prostate tumors by diffusion tensor imaging and logistic regression modelling.', 'The role of diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy in the evaluation of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a literature review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Acquisition Parameters Influence Diffusion Metrics Effectiveness in Probing Prostate Tumor and Age-Related Microstructure.', 'Mapping prostatic microscopic anisotropy using linear and spherical b-tensor encoding: A preliminary study.', 'Effect of Echo Times on Prostate Cancer Detection on T2-Weighted Images.', 'Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of breast cancer: associations between diffusion metrics and histological prognostic factors.', 'Radiomic features on MRI enable risk categorization of prostate cancer patients on active surveillance: Preliminary findings.']"""

Material and methods:   A single-center, prospective, transversal, epidemiological study was conducted from January 2010 to January 2014. We consecutively included patients who an imaging study of the prostate with BMUS, PDUS, and CEUS was performed, followed by prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PSA 4-20ng/mL and/or rectal exam suggestive of malignancy). The diagnostic performance of BMUS, PDUS, and CEUS was determined by calculating the Sensitivity (S), Specificity (Sp), Predictive values (PV), and diagnostic odds ratio (OR) of the diagnosis tests and, for these variables, in the population general and based on their clinical stage according to rectal exam (cT1 and cT2). PCa detection rates determined by means of a randomized 10-core biopsy scheme were compared with detection rates of CEUS-targeted (SonoVue) 2-core biopsies.  Results:   Of the initial 984 patients, US contrast SonoVue was administered to 179 (18.2%). The PCa detection rate by organ of BMUS/PDUS in the global population was 38% versus 43% in the subpopulation with CEUS. The mean age of the patients was 64.3Â±7.01years (95% CI, 63.75-64.70); mean total PSA was 8.9Â±3.61ng/mL (95% CI, 8.67-9.13) and the mean prostate volume was 56.2Â±29cc (95% CI, 54.2-58.1). The detection rate by organ of targeted biopsy with BMUS, PDUS, and CEUS were as follows: Global population (10.6, 8.2, 24.5%), stage cT1 (5.6, 4.2, 16.4%), and stage cT2 (32.4, 22.3, 43.5%). Comparing the detection rates of the CEUS-targeted biopsy and randomized biopsy, the following results were obtained: Global population (24.5% vs. 41.8%), stage cT1 (16% vs. 35%), and stage cT2 (43.5% vs. 66.6%), with a p value<0.05. Following the ""core-by-core"" analysis, the detection rates by core of CEUS-targeted biopsy versus randomized biopsy were: Global population (16% vs. 13%), stage cT1 (30.3% vs. 28%), and stage cT2 (48% vs. 37%), with a p value>0.05. The NNT for CEUS-targeted biopsy was 83.3.  Conclusions:   The low sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of gray scale-B-mode, PDUS and CEUS represent scant diagnostic performance of these variables in prostate cancer detection. Prostate cancer detection rates yielded by randomized biopsy were superior than the detection rate of targeted biopsy using B-mode, PDUS and CEUS; as a result, randomized biopsy versus CEUS-targeted biopsies cannot be excluded from biopsy strategy plans for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['F Delgado Oliva', 'S Arlandis Guzman', 'M Bonillo GarcÃ­a', 'E Broseta Rico', 'F Boronat Tormo']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['The utility of transrectal real-time elastography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Colour Doppler and microbubble contrast agent ultrasonography do not improve cancer detection rate in transrectal systematic prostate biopsy sampling.', 'Real-time contrast-enhanced transrectal US-guided prostate biopsy: diagnostic accuracy in men with previously negative biopsy results and positive MR imaging findings.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for diagnosis of prostate cancer and kidney lesions.', 'Optimizing biopsy strategy for prostate cancer: Bayesian framework of network meta-analysis and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model for diagnostic accuracy.', 'Endorectal power Doppler/grayscale ultrasound-guided biopsies vs. multiparametric MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsies in males with high risk of prostate cancer: A prospective cohort study.', 'Optimal biopsy strategy for prostate cancer detection by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'A direct comparison of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer detection and prediction of aggressiveness.']"""

Gallic acid (GA) is a polyhydroxy phenolic compound which can inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GA treatment on cell viability, proliferation, invasion, IL-6 gene expression, IL-6 secretion, cellular levels of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, and pAKT signaling proteins in human prostate cancer PC3 cells. PC3 cells viability after treatment with GA (0-120Î¼M) was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The expression of IL-6 was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cellular concentration of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, and pAKT signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting technic. PC3 cells invasion was assessed by invasion assay test. Treatment with GA caused a significant decrease in cell viability, proliferation, invasion, cellular levels of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, and pAKT signaling proteins after 48h in a dose-dependent manner. The level of IL-6 and its gene expression decreased significantly in PC3 cells treated with GA. Our results show that IL-6 down-regulation and decreased IL-6 protein level in PC3 cells by GA resulted in diminishing of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, and pAKT signaling proteins which lead to the reduction of the cell survival, proliferation, and invasion in PC3 cells.

Docetaxel has been an important treatment option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, nearly all patients with CRPC treated with docetaxel eventually become refractory. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and distribution of kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) in human PCa by immunohistochemistry and examined the effect of inhibiting KIFC1 expression on docetaxel resistance.  Methods:   Expression of KIFC1 was determined using immunohistochemistry. RNA interference was used to inhibit KIFC1 expression in PCa cell lines.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 12 patients who underwent mpMRI before and after TRT while on active surveillance. Changes in serum testosterone level, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate biopsy findings, prostate volume, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADSv2) score before and after TRT were summarized.  Results:   After TRT, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone (516.5ng/dl vs. 203.0ng/dl), PSA (4.2ng/ml vs. 3.3ng/ml), and prostate volume (55.2cm3 vs. 39.4cm3).

The PI-RADSv2 scores before and after TRT were unchanged in 10/12 patients; none of these demonstrated biopsy progression on post-TRT. The PI-RADSv2 scores increased after TRT in 2/12 patients; both showed Gleason score upgrade on follow-up biopsy. Of these 2 patients, 1 patient underwent radical treatment due to clinical progression. The area under the curve for detecting biopsy progression calculated from PI-RADSv2 score after TRT was 0.90, which was better than that calculated from post-TRT PSA level (0.48).

Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were observed in a proportion of strongly metastatic human prostate and breast cancer cells (PC-3M and MDA-MB-231, respectively). In contrast, no such oscillations were observed in weakly/non metastatic LNCaP and MCF-7 cells, although a rise in the resting Ca2+ level could be induced by applying a high-K+ solution. Various parameters of the oscillations depended on extracellular Ca2+ and voltage-gated Na+ channel activity. Treatment with either tetrodotoxin (a general blocker of voltage-gated Na+ channels) or ranolazine (a blocker of the persistent component of the channel current) suppressed the Ca2+ oscillations.

Master regulator analysis using the prostate cancer-specific regulatory interactome identified that the transcription factor E2F8 as a specific target molecule regulates geraniol-specific cell cycle signatures. Subsequent experiments confirmed that geraniol down-regulated E2F8 expression and the knockdown of E2F8 was sufficient to suppress cell growth by inducing G2 /M arrest. Epidemiological analysis showed that E2F8 is up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer and associated with poor prognosis.

The targeting of therapeutics to GRPR can be achieved using the full-length (14 amino acid) GRP analogue Bombesin (BBN) or the truncated BBN(6-14) sequence, both of which bind GRPR with high affinity and specificity. In this study, we have investigated the level of GRPR expression in various cancerous (Caco-2, HeLa, LNCap, MDA-MB-231, and PC-3) and non-cancerous (WPMY-1) cell lines using a western blotting approach. Such information is currently lacking in the literature, and is therefore of importance for the in vitro assessment of GRPR targeted therapeutics. Of the cell lines assessed, the PC-3 (prostate cancer) and Caco-2 (colon cancer) cell lines demonstrated the highest and lowest levels of GRPR expression respectively. Using this information, we further investigated the cellular uptake of carboxyfluorescein-labelled BBN and BBN(6-14) peptides by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy using cell lines that express GRPR (Caco-2, HeLa, PC-3). The uptake of each of these peptides was similar, suggesting that the shorter BBN(6-14) peptide is sufficient for GRPR targeting. Further, the uptake of these peptides could be inhibited by competition with unlabelled BBN peptides, suggesting their cellular uptake is GRPR-mediated, while the level of BBN uptake (as measured by flow cytometry) was found to be directly proportional to the level of GRPR expression.

CRPC is associated with renewed androgen receptor activity in tumor cells and restoration of tumor androgen levels through acquired intratumoral steroidogenesis (AIS). Although prostate cancer (PCa) cells have been shown to have steroidogenic capability in vitro, we previously found that benign prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) can also synthesize testosterone (T) from an adrenal precursor, DHEA, when stimulated with a hedgehog (Hh) pathway agonist, SAG. Here, we show exposure of PrSCs to a different Smoothened (Smo) agonist, Ag1.5, or to conditioned medium from sonic hedgehog overexpressing LNCaP cells induces steroidogenic enzyme expression in PrSCs and significantly increases production of T and its precursor steroids in a Smo-dependent manner from 22-OH-cholesterol substrate. Hh agonist-/ligand-treated PrSCs produced androgens at a rate similar to or greater than that of PCa cell lines. Likewise, primary bone marrow stromal cells became more steroidogenic and produced T under the influence of Smo agonist. Treatment of mice bearing LNCaP xenografts with a Smo antagonist, TAK-441, delayed the onset of CRPC after castration and substantially reduced androgen levels in residual tumors. These outcomes support the idea that stromal cells in ADT-treated primary or metastatic prostate tumors can contribute to AIS as a consequence of a paracrine Hh signaling microenvironment. As such, Smo antagonists may be useful for targeting prostate tumor stromal cell-derived AIS and delaying the onset of CRPC after ADT.""","""['Amy A Lubik', 'Mannan Nouri', 'Sarah Truong', 'Mazyar Ghaffari', 'Hans H Adomat', 'Eva Corey', 'Michael E Cox', 'Na Li', 'Emma S Guns', 'Parvin Yenki', 'Steven Pham', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['TAK-441, a novel investigational smoothened antagonist, delays castration-resistant progression in prostate cancer by disrupting paracrine hedgehog signaling.', 'Paracrine Hedgehog increases the steroidogenic potential of prostate stromal cells in a Gli-dependent manner.', 'SEMA3C induces androgen synthesis in prostatic stromal cells through paracrine signaling.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reconsideration of progression to CRPC during androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in granulosa cells from patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.', 'Hedgehog/GLI1 signaling pathway regulates the resistance to cisplatin in human osteosarcoma.', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Smoothened loss is a characteristic of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Effects of the Hedgehog Signaling Inhibitor Itraconazole on Developing Rat Ovaries.']"""

Thyroid cancer was the most common cancer and was diagnosed in 13 patients (11.8%); other cancers encountered were gastric cancer (N=2), endometrial cancer (N-2), and breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer (N-2), myelodysplastic syndrome, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic carcinoma, one case each. Age, gender, age at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly, tumor size of pituitary adenoma and duration of disease were not associated with cancer development.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that patients with acromegaly have an increased risk of thyroid cancer and therefore they should undergo regular screening with hormonal and ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid and FNAB when required.""","""['Dimitrios Kaldrymidis', 'Georgios Papadakis', 'Georgios Tsakonas', 'Philippos Kaldrymidis', 'Theofanis Flaskas', 'Andreas Seretis', 'Eleni Pantazi', 'Ifigenia Kostoglou-Athanassiou', 'Melpomeni Peppa', 'Paraskevi Roussou', 'Evanthia Diamanti-Kandarakis']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['The occurrence of thyroid focal lesions and a need for fine needle aspiration biopsy in patients with acromegaly due to an increased risk of thyroid cancer.', 'Increased thyroid cancer risk in acromegaly.', 'High prevalence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma in acromegaly.', 'Complications of acromegaly: thyroid and colon.', 'Is there an association between acromegaly and thyroid carcinoma?

Rapid yet accurate text mining on large-scale scientific literature can discover novel knowledge to better understand human diseases and to improve the quality of disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.  Results:   In this study, we designed and developed an efficient text mining framework called SparkText on a Big Data infrastructure, which is composed of Apache Spark data streaming and machine learning methods, combined with a Cassandra NoSQL database. To demonstrate its performance for classifying cancer types, we extracted information (e.g., breast, prostate, and lung cancers) from tens of thousands of articles downloaded from PubMed, and then employed NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression to build prediction models to mine the articles. The accuracy of predicting a cancer type by SVM using the 29,437 full-text articles was 93.81%. While competing text-mining tools took more than 11 hours, SparkText mined the dataset in approximately 6 minutes.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the potential for mining large-scale scientific articles on a Big Data infrastructure, with real-time update from new articles published daily.

The CBCT imaging procedure for patient setup adds substantial radiation dose to patient's normal tissue. This study pre-sents a complete procedure for the CBCT dosimetry using the InLight optically-stimulated-luminescence (OSL) nanoDots. We report five dose parameters: the mean slice dose (DMSD); the cone beam dose index (CBDIW); the mean volume dose (DMVD); point-dose profile, D(FOV); and the off-field Dose. In addition, CBCT skin doses for seven pelvic tumor patients are reported. CBCT-dose mea-surement was performed on a custom-made cylindrical acrylic body phantom (50cm length, 32cm diameter). We machined 25 circular disks (2 cm thick) with grooves and holes to hold OSL-nanoDots. OSLs that showed similar sensitivities were selected and calibrated against a Farmer-type ionization-chamber (0.6 CT) before being inserted into the grooves and holes. For the phantom scan, a standard CBCT-imaging protocol (pelvic sites: 125 kVp, 80 mA and 25 ms) was used. Five dose parameters were quantified: DMSD, CBDIW, DMVD, D(FOV), and the off-field dose. The DMSD for the central slice was 31.1 Â± 0.85 mGy, and CBDIW was 34.5Â± 0.6 mGy at 16cm FOV. The DMVD was 25.6 Â± 1.1 mGy. The off-field dose was 10.5 mGy. For patients, the anterior and lateral skin doses attributable to CBCT imaging were 39.04 Â± 4.4 and 27.1 Â± 1.3 mGy, respectively.OSL nanoDots were convenient to use in measuring CBCT dose. The method of selecting the nanoDots greatly reduced uncertainty in the OSL measurements. Our detailed calibration procedure and CBCT dose measurements and calculations could prove useful in developing OSL routines for CBCT quality assessment, which in turn gives them the property of high spatial resolution, meaning that they have the potential for measurement of dose in regions of severe dose-gradients.""","""['Noor Mail', 'Muhammad Yusuf', 'Nazeeh Alothmany', 'A Abdulrahman Kinsara', 'Fahad Abdulkhaliq', 'Suliman M Ghamdi', 'Abdelhamid Saoudi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Phantom and in-vivo measurements of dose exposure by image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT): MV portal images vs. kV portal images vs. cone-beam CT.', 'Investigation of the radiation dose from cone-beam CT for image-guided radiotherapy: A comparison of methodologies.', 'Cone beam computed tomography for dental and maxillofacial imaging: technique improvement and low-dose protocols.', 'Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography imaging dose estimation and optimization: Need of daily cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Customized double-shell immobilization device combined with VMAT radiation treatment of basosquamous cell carcinoma of the scalp.']"""

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of DVH based QA in quantifying delivery errors. Eighteen previously treated VMAT plans (prostate, H&N, and brain) were randomly chosen for this study. Conventional IMRT delivery QA was done with the ArcCHECK diode detector for error-free plans and plans with the following modifications: 1) induced monitor unit differences up to Â± 3.0%, 2) control point deletion (3, 5, and 8 control points were deleted for each arc), and 3) gantry angle shift (2Â° uniform shift clockwise and counterclockwise). 2D and 3D distance-to-agreement (DTA) analyses were performed for all plans with SNC Patient software and 3DVH software, respectively. Subsequently, accuracy of the reconstructed DVH curves and DVH parameters in 3DVH software were analyzed for all selected cases using the plans in the Eclipse treatment planning system as standard. 3D DTA analysis for error-induced plans generally gave high pass rates, whereas the 2D evaluation seemed to be more sensitive to detecting delivery errors. The average differences for DVH parameters between each pair of Eclipse recalculation and 3DVH prediction were within 2% for all three types of error-induced treatment plans. This illustrates that 3DVH accurately quantifies delivery errors in terms of actual dose delivered to the patients. 2D DTA analysis should be routinely used for clinical evaluation. Any concerns or dose discrepancies should be further analyzed through DVH-based QA for clinically relevant results and confirmation of a conventional passing-rate-based QA.""","""['Tianjun Ma', 'Matthew B Podgorsak', 'Lalith K Kumaraswamy']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comparison of DVH-based plan verification methods for VMAT: ArcCHECK-3DVH system and dynalog-based dose reconstruction.', 'Initial experience of ArcCHECK and 3DVH software for RapidArc treatment plan verification.', '3D DVH-based metric analysis versus per-beam planar analysis in IMRT pretreatment verification.', 'DVH analysis using a transmission detector and model-based dose verification system as a comprehensive pretreatment QA tool for VMAT plans: Clinical experience and results.', 'Comparing measurement-derived (3DVH) and machine log file-derived dose reconstruction methods for VMAT QA in patient geometries.', 'Incorporating biological modeling into patient-specific plan verification.', 'Comparison of gamma index based on dosimetric error and clinically relevant dose-volume index based on three-dimensional dose prediction in breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy.']"""

We present our clinical experience with the planning techniques and plan quality assurance measurements of mARC delivery. Clinical mARC plans for five representative cases (prostate, low-dose-rate brain, brain with partial-arc vertex fields, pancreas, and liver SBRT) were generated using a Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system. A conventional-dose-rate flat 6 MV and a high-dose-rate non-flat 7 MV beam are available for planning and delivery. mARC plans for intact-prostate cases can typically be created using one 360Â° arc, and treatment times per fraction seldom exceed 6 min using the flat beam; using the nonflat beam results in slightly higher MU per fraction, but also in delivery times less than 4 min and with reduced mean dose to distal organs at risk. mARC also has utility in low-dose-rate brain irradiation; mARC fields can be designed which deliver a uniform 20 cGy dose to the PTV in approximately 3-minute intervals, making it a viable alternative to conventional 3D CRT. For brain cases using noncoplanar arcs, delivery time is approximately six min using the nonflat beam. For pancreas cases using the nonflat beam, two overlapping 360Â° arcs are required, and delivery times are approximately 10 min. For liver SBRT, the time to deliver 800 cGy per frac-tion is at least 12 min. Plan QA measurements indicate that the mARC delivery is consistent with the plan calculation for all cases. mARC has been incorporated into routine practice within our clinic; currently, on average approximately 15 patients per day are treated using mARC; and with the exception of LDR brain cases, all are treated using the nonflat beam.""","""['Kristofer Kainz', 'Douglas Prah', 'Ergun Ahunbay', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A planning and delivery study of a rotational IMRT technique with burst delivery.', 'Evaluation of volumetric modulated arc therapy for cranial radiosurgery using multiple noncoplanar arcs.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Quality management in radiotherapy treatment delivery.', 'Innovations in three-dimensional treatment planning and quality assurance.']"""

For this purpose the entire work is divided into two stages. At forefront stage all basic beam properties of 6 MV X-rays like PDD, profiles, output factors, TPR20/10 and MLC transmission of two beam-matched machines - Varian Clinac iX and Varian 600 C/D Unique - are compared and evaluated for differences. At second stage 40 IMRT and RapidArc patient plans from the pool of head and neck (H&N) and pelvis sites are selected for the study. The plans are swapped across the machines for dose recalculation and the DVHs of target and critical organs are evaluated for dose differences. Following this, the accuracy of the beam-matching at the TPS level for treatments like IMRT and RapidArc are compared. On PDD, profile (central 80%) and output factor comparison between the two machines, a maxi-mum percentage disagreement value of -2.39%, -2.0% and -2.78%, respectively, has been observed. The maximum dose difference observed at volumes in IMRT and RapidArc treatments for H&N dose prescription of 69.3 Gy/33 fractions is 0.88 Gy and 0.82 Gy, respectively. Similarly, for pelvis, with a dose prescription of 50 Gy/25 fractions, a maximum dose difference of 0.55 Gy and 0.53 Gy is observed at volumes in IMRT and RapidArc treatments, respectively.

Therefore, we aimed to study the level of preparedness before radical prostatectomy and the level of bother experienced from urinary incontinence and decreased sexual health after surgery.  Material and methods:   We prospectively collected data from a non-selected group of men undergoing radical prostatectomy in 14 centers between 2008 and 2011.

One year after surgery, we asked about bother caused by urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. As a measure of the association between preparedness and bothersomeness we modeled odds ratios (ORs) by means of logistic regression.  Results:   Altogether 1372 men had urinary incontinence one year after surgery as well as had no urinary leakage or a small urinary dribble before surgery. Among these men, low preparedness was associated with bother resulting from urinary incontinence [OR 2.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-5.10].

The premise of the model is non-enzymatic crosslinking of reconstituted BM (rBM) matrix by treatment with glycolaldehyde (GLA) to promote advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) generation via the Maillard reaction. Examples of laboratory techniques that can be used to confirm AGE generation, non-enzymatic crosslinking and increased stiffness in GLA treated rBM are outlined. These include preparation of native rBM (treated with phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) and stiff rBM (treated with GLA) for determination of: its AGE content by photometric analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy, its non-enzymatic crosslinking by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) as well as confocal microscopy, and its increased stiffness using rheometry. The procedure described here can be used to increase the rigidity (elastic moduli, E) of rBM up to 3.2-fold, consistent with measurements made in healthy versus diseased human prostate tissue. To recreate the biophysical microenvironment associated with the aging and diseased prostate gland three prostate cell types were introduced on to native rBM and stiff rBM: RWPE-1, prostate epithelial cells (PECs) derived from a normal prostate gland; BPH-1, PECs derived from a prostate gland affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); and PC3, metastatic cells derived from a secondary bone tumor originating from prostate cancer. Multiple parameters can be measured, including the size, shape and invasive characteristics of the 3D glandular acini formed by RWPE-1 and BPH-1 on native versus stiff rBM, and average cell length, migratory velocity and persistence of cell movement of 3D spheroids formed by PC3 cells under the same conditions.

The purpose of this phase II study was to evaluate mechanisms of resistance to more complete androgen synthesis inhibition with abiraterone and dutasteride.Experimental Design: Eligible patients with metastatic CRPC underwent a baseline metastasis biopsy. Patients received abiraterone and prednisone for two 4-week cycles. After this time, high-dose dutasteride (3.5 mg daily) was added. Patients continued therapy until study withdrawal or radiographic progression. Repeat metastasis biopsy was obtained at progression. The primary endpoint was to assess mechanisms of resistance. Serum hormone and abiraterone levels were assessed. Tissue was assessed for androgen receptor (AR) and AR splice variant-7 (ARV7) expression.Results: Forty patients were enrolled. Sixty percent (n = 24) achieved a â¥50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The median time to radiographic progression was 11 months. Nearly all baseline (n = 29 of 31) and posttreatment (n = 16 of 16) tumors tested for AR nuclear expression were positive. Of those tested, ARV7 expression was present in 48% (n = 10 of 21) of baseline and 42% (n = 5 of 12) of treatment discontinuation specimens. Compared with patients with higher serum abiraterone levels at treatment discontinuation, patients with lower levels had higher circulating androgens.Conclusions: Despite increased androgen synthesis inhibition, we demonstrate that tumor AR axis remains important in disease progression. We highlight that abiraterone metabolism and pharmacokinetics may play a role in resistance. The noncomparative design limits conclusions on the efficacy of dual therapy with abiraterone and dutasteride, but the results support development of further multifaceted approaches toward AR inhibition.

Disease progression is marked by an overall down-regulation of long PDE4D isoforms, while short isoforms (PDE4D1/2) appear to be relatively unaffected. While these alterations seem to be independent of copy number alterations in the PDE4D locus and driven by AR and ERG binding, we also observed increased DNA methylation in the promoter region of PDE4D5, indicating a long lasting alteration of the isoform composition in prostate cancer tissues.We propose two independent metrics that may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers for prostate disease: (PDE4D7 - PDE4D5) provides an effective means for distinguishing PCa from normal adjacent prostate, whereas PDE4D1/2 - (PDE4D5 + PDE4D7 + PDE4D9) offers strong prognostic potential to detect aggressive forms of PCa and is associated with metastasis free survival.

Materials and methods:   We examined records of 25,254 patients treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) between 2010 and 2013, within the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. The ROC derived AUC assessed discriminant properties of the updated 2012 Partin Tables of organ confined disease (OC), extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesical invasion (SVI), and lymph node invasion (LNI). Calibration plots focused on calibration between predicted and observed rates.  Results:   Proportions of OC, ECE, SVI, and LNI at RP were 69.8%, 18.4%, 7.4%, and 4.4%, respectively. Accuracy for prediction of OC, ECE, SVI, and LNI was 70.4%, 59.9%, 72.9%, and 77.1%, respectively. In subgroup analyses in patients with nodal yield >10, accuracy for LNI prediction was 76.0%. Subgroup analyses in elderly patients and in African American patients revealed decreased accuracy for prediction of all four endpoints. Last but not least, SVI and LNI calibration plots showed excellent agreement, versus good agreement for OC (maximum underestimation of 10%) and poor agreement for ECE (maximum overestimation of 12%).  Conclusion:   Taken together, the updated 2012 Partin Tables can be unequivocally endorsed for prediction of OC, SVI, and LNI in community-based patients with localized PCa.

Candidate AR-regulating miRNAs were verified through AR transcriptional reporter and cell viability assays. MiRNA binding sites were found within the AR 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and within the AR and AR-V7 coding regions. MiRNA activity was characterized by western blotting, 3'-UTR reporter assay, and AR-GFP and AR-V7-GFP reporter assays. Results uncovered miR-30 family members as direct AR inhibitors. Inhibition of endogenous miR-30b-3p and miR-30d-5p enhanced AR expression and androgen-independent cell growth. Droplet digital RT-PCR quantification of miR-30c-5p and miR-30d-5p revealed significantly reduced levels in metastatic castration resistant PCa (CRPC), when compared to healthy prostate tissues.

ULK1 expression, LRPPRC expression, Gleason score, PSA levels after ADT and number of metastatic sites were independently associated with shorter BCP-free survival and OS on multivariate analysis. Furthermore, two-year BCP rate of patients with â¥3 risk factors was found to be significantly higher as compared with that of patients with â¤1 and 2 risk factors. Three-year OS rate in patients with â¥3 risk factors was significantly lower than that of those with â¤1 and 2 risk factors.

Moreover, androgen receptor (AR) has been causally involved in the homeostasis of human prostate endothelial cells. However, levels of expression, functionality and biological role of AR in male- and female-derived human endothelial cells (ECs) remain poorly characterized. The objectives of this work were (1) to characterize the functional expression of AR in male- and female-derived human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and (2) to specifically analyze the biological effects of DHT, and the role of AR on these effects, in male-derived HUVECs (mHUVECs).  Results:   Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue microarrays from benign human tissues confirmed expression of AR in ECs from several androgen-regulated and non-androgen-regulated human organs. Functional expression of AR was validated in vitro in male- and female-derived HUVECs using quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting and AR-mediated transcriptional activity assays. Our results indicated that functional expression of AR in male- and female-derived HUVECs was heterogeneous, but not sex dependent. In parallel, we analyzed in depth the biological effects of DHT, and the role of AR on these effects, on proliferation, survival and tube formation capacity in mHUVECs. Our results indicated that DHT did not affect mHUVEC survival; however, DHT stimulated mHUVEC proliferation and suppressed mHUVEC tube formation capacity. While the effect of DHT on proliferation was mediated through AR, the effect of DHT on tube formation did not depend on the presence of a functional AR, but rather depended on the ability of mHUVECs to further metabolize DHT.  Conclusions:   (1) Heterogeneous expression of AR in male- and female-derived HUVEC could define the presence of functionally different subpopulations of ECs that may be affected differentially by androgens, which could explain, at least in part, the pleiotropic effects of androgen on vascular biology, and (2) DHT, and metabolites of DHT, generally thought to represent progressively more hydrophilic products along the path to elimination, may have differential roles in modulating the biology of human ECs through AR-dependent and AR-independent mechanisms, respectively.""","""['VerÃ³nica Torres-Estay', 'Daniela V CarreÃ±o', 'Patricia Fuenzalida', 'Anica Watts', 'Ignacio F San Francisco', 'Viviana P Montecinos', 'Paula C Sotomayor', 'John Ebos', 'Gary J Smith', 'Alejandro S Godoy']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Angiogenesis""","""['Regulated expression of the prostacyclin receptor (IP) gene by androgens within the vasculature: Combined role for androgens and serum cholesterol.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Genomic Androgen Action Augments Ischemia-Induced Neovascularization.', 'Dihydrotestosterone promotes vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in male human endothelial cells via a nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent pathway.', 'Androgen receptor in human endothelial cells.', 'In situ androgen and estrogen biosynthesis in endometrial cancer: focus on androgen actions and intratumoral production.', 'The Differential Paracrine Role of the Endothelium in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Mitochondria in Sex Hormone-Induced Disorder of Energy Metabolism in Males and Females.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Role of Glucose-Lowering Medications in Erectile Dysfunction.', 'Coagulation Factor Xa Promotes Solid Tumor Growth, Experimental Metastasis and Endothelial Cell Activation.']"""

Because gene expression is frequently altered in cancer, a systematic understanding of the Mediator complex in malignancies could foster the development of novel targeted therapeutic approaches.Experimental Design: We performed a systematic deconvolution of the Mediator subunit expression profiles across 23 cancer entities (n = 8,568) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Prostate cancer-specific findings were validated in two publicly available gene expression cohorts and a large cohort of primary and advanced prostate cancer (n = 622) stained by immunohistochemistry. The role of CDK19 and CDK8 was evaluated by siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and inhibitor treatment in prostate cancer cell lines with functional assays and gene expression analysis by RNAseq.Results: Cluster analysis of TCGA expression data segregated tumor entities, indicating tumor-type-specific Mediator complex compositions. Only prostate cancer was marked by high expression of CDK19 In primary prostate cancer, CDK19 was associated with increased aggressiveness and shorter disease-free survival. During cancer progression, highest levels of CDK19 and of its paralog CDK8 were present in metastases. In vitro, inhibition of CDK19 and CDK8 by knockdown or treatment with a selective CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor significantly decreased migration and invasion.Conclusions: Our analysis revealed distinct transcriptional expression profiles of the Mediator complex across cancer entities indicating differential modes of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, it identified CDK19 and CDK8 to be specifically overexpressed during prostate cancer progression, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic targets in advanced prostate cancer.

We examined the added value of circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration relative to common prognostic laboratory measures from patients with CRPC.Methods: Utility of CTC enumeration as a baseline and postbaseline prognostic biomarker was examined using data from two prospective randomized registration-directed trials (COU-AA-301 and ELM-PC4) within statistical models used to estimate risk for survival. Discrimination and calibration were used to measure model predictive accuracy and the added value for CTC enumeration in the context of a Cox model containing albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PSA, hemoglobin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALK). Discrimination quantifies how accurately a risk model predicts short-term versus long-term survivors. Calibration measures the closeness of actual survival time to the predicted survival time.Results: Adding CTC enumeration to a model containing albumin, LDH, PSA, hemoglobin, and ALK (""ALPHA"") improved its discriminatory power. The weighted c-index for ALPHA without CTCs was 0.72 (SE, 0.02) versus 0.75 (SE, 0.02) for ALPHA + CTCs. The increase in discrimination was restricted to the lower-risk cohort. In terms of calibration, adding CTCs produced a more accurate model-based prediction of patient survival. The absolute prediction error for ALPHA was 3.95 months (SE, 0.28) versus 3.75 months (SE, 0.22) for ALPHA + CTCs.Conclusions: Addition of CTC enumeration to standard measures provides more accurate assessment of patient risk in terms of baseline and postbaseline prognosis in the mCRPC population.

We describe the current burden of cancer in CSA.  Methods:   We obtained regional and national-level cancer incidence data from 48 population-based registries (13 countries) and nation-wide cancer mortality data from the WHO (18 countries). We estimated world population age-standardized incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years.  Results:   The leading cancers diagnosed were prostate, lung, breast, cervix, colorectal, and stomach, which were also the primary causes of cancer mortality. Countries of high/very high human development index (HDI) in the region experienced a high burden of prostate and breast cancer while medium HDI countries had a high burden of stomach and cervical cancers. Between countries, incidence and mortality from all cancers combined varied by 2-3-fold. French Guyana, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina had the highest incidence of all cancers while Uruguay, Cuba, Argentina, and Chile had the highest mortality. Incidence of colorectum, prostate and thyroid cancers increased in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica from 1997 to 2008, while lung, stomach and cervical cancers decreased.  Conclusion:   CSA carries a double-burden of cancer, with elevated rates of infection- and lifestyle-related cancers. Encountered variation in cancer rates between countries may reflect differences in registration practices, healthcare access, and public awareness.

Methods:   Prostate cancer survivors (N = 830) who participated in a case-control study with invasive stage â¥II disease were followed up to 2007 to capture QoL outcomes. At baseline and three time points postdiagnosis (2000-2007), interviews/questionnaires were used to collect data on physical activity, general QoL measured by the SF-36, and other treatment/lifestyle factors. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the relation between postdiagnosis physical activity and QoL as well as the change in physical activity over the diagnostic period and QoL.  Results:   Both total and recreational physical activities were positively associated with physical QoL. Furthermore, when comparing changes in physical activity levels from pre- to postdiagnosis, men who consistently met physical activity guidelines had significantly higher physical [Î² = 6.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.15-7.86] and mental (Î² = 2.32; 95% CI, 0.29-4.34) QoL scores compared with those who did not meet guidelines pre- or postdiagnosis. Furthermore, those who adopted and met guidelines had increased QoL, whereas those who relapsed experienced decreased QoL.  Conclusions:   Postdiagnosis recreational physical activity is associated with better physical QoL in prostate cancer survivors. Moreover, prostate cancer survivors who maintain or adopt physical activity after diagnosis report substantially higher QoL than men who never exercised or stopped exercising after diagnosis.  Impact:   Future intervention studies should focus on achieving and maintaining adherence to physical activity guidelines postdiagnosis in prostate cancer survivors.

However, resistance formation is common after initial response. The protein Src is known as a proto-oncogene, which is overexpressed in various human cancers. Since there are controversial reports about the role of Src in bladder cancer, we evaluated the efficacy of the Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib in the urothelial bladder cancer cell line RT112 and its gemcitabine-resistant sub-line RT112rGEMCI20 in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   RT112 urothelial cancer cells were adapted to growth in the presence of 20 ng/ml gemcitabine (RT112rGEMCI20) by continuous cultivation at increasing drug concentrations. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay, cell growth kinetics were determined by cell count, protein levels were measured by western blot, and cell migration was evaluated by scratch assays. In vivo tumor growth was tested in a murine orthotopic xenograft model using bioluminescent imaging.  Results:   Dasatinib exerted similar effects on Src signaling in RT112 and RT112rGEMCI20 cells but RT112rGEMCI20 cells were less sensitive to dasatinib-induced anti-cancer effects (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of dasatinib in RT112 cells: 349.2 Â± 67.2 nM; IC50 of dasatinib in RT112rGEMCI20 cells: 1081.1 Â± 239.2 nM). Dasatinib inhibited migration of chemo-naive and gemcitabine-resistant cells. Most strikingly, dasatinib treatment reduced RT112 tumor growth and muscle invasion in orthotopic xenografts, while it was associated with increased size and muscle-invasive growth in RT112rGEMCI20 tumors.

To understand the importance of potential interplay between pro-inflammatory and androgen signaling for gene regulation, we have interrogated the crosstalk between androgen receptor (AR) and NF-ÎºB, a key transcriptional mediator of inflammatory responses, by utilizing genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and global run-on sequencing in PC cells. Co-stimulation of LNCaP cells with androgen and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ± invoked a transcriptome which was very distinct from that induced by either stimulation alone. The altered transcriptome that included gene programs linked to cell migration and invasiveness was orchestrated by significant remodeling of NF-ÎºB and AR cistrome and enhancer landscape. Although androgen multiplied the NF-ÎºB cistrome and TNFÎ± restrained the AR cistrome, there was no general reciprocal tethering of the AR to the NF-ÎºB on chromatin. Instead, redistribution of FOXA1, PIAS1 and PIAS2 contributed to the exposure of latent NF-ÎºB chromatin-binding sites and masking of AR chromatin-binding sites. Taken together, concomitant androgen and pro-inflammatory signaling significantly remodels especially the NF-ÎºB cistrome, reprogramming the PC cell transcriptome in fashion that may contribute to the progression of PC.""","""['Marjo Malinen', 'Einari A Niskanen', 'Minna U Kaikkonen', 'Jorma J Palvimo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['SUMO ligase PIAS1 functions as a target gene selective androgen receptor coregulator on prostate cancer cell chromatin.', 'Darolutamide antagonizes androgen signaling by blocking enhancer and super-enhancer activation.', 'Interplay of nuclear factor-kappaB and B-myb in the negative regulation of androgen receptor expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Chromatin binding by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'TRAF4-mediated nonproteolytic ubiquitination of androgen receptor promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-ÎºB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Identification of androgen response-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', ""KL-FGF23-VD Axis in Improving Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease by Modulating IKK/NF-ÎºB Signal Pathway."", 'Dynamic nucleosome landscape elicits a noncanonical GATA2 pioneer model.']"""

When expressed alone in cells, some AR-Vs (e.g., AR-V7) localize primarily to the nucleus, whereas others (e.g., AR-V1, AR-V4, and AR-V6) localize mainly to the cytoplasm. Significantly, the latter are often coexpressed with the nucleus-predominant AR-Vs and the full-length AR (AR-FL). An important question to be addressed is whether the cytoplasmic-localized AR-Vs play a role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through interaction with the nucleus-predominant AR-Vs and AR-FL. Here, it is demonstrated that AR-V1, -V4, and -V6 can dimerize with both AR-V7 and AR-FL. Consequently, AR-V7 and androgen-bound AR-FL induced nuclear localization of AR-V1, -V4, and -V6, and these variants, in turn, mitigated the ability of the antiandrogen enzalutamide to inhibit androgen-induced AR-FL nuclear localization. Interestingly, the impact of nuclear localization of AR-V4 and -V6 on AR transactivation differs from that of AR-V1. Nuclear localization leads to an increased ability of AR-V4 and -V6 to transactivate both canonical AR targets and AR-V-specific targets and to confer castration-resistant cell growth. However, although AR-V1, which lacks inherent transcriptional activity, appears to activate AR-FL in an androgen-independent manner, it significantly antagonizes AR-V7 transactivation. Together, these data demonstrate that the complex interactions among different AR-Vs and AR-FL play a significant role in castration-resistant disease.  Implications:   This study suggests important consequences for clinical castration resistance due to simultaneous expression of AR-FL and AR-Vs in patient tumors and suggests that dissecting these interactions should help develop effective strategies to disrupt AR-V signaling.

Therefore, agents that impair cancer cell proliferation could have potential therapeutic value. Higher plants are considered to be a good source of anticancer agents, and several clinically tested chemotherapeutic agents have been isolated from plants or derived from constituents of plant origin.  Methods:   In the present study, a prenylated flavone (isoglabratephrin) was isolated from aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea using a bioassay-guided technique. Chemical structure of the isolated compound was elucidated using spectroscopic techniques (NMR, IR, and LC-MC), elemental analysis and confirmed by using single crystal X-ray analysis. The antiproliferative effect of isoglabratephrin was tested using three human cancer cell lines (prostate (PC3), pancreatic (PANC-1), and colon (HCT-116) and one normal cell line (human fibroblast).  Results:   Isoglabratephrin displayed selective inhibitory activity against proliferation of PC3 and PANC-1 cells with median inhibitory concentration values of 20.4 and 26.6 Î¼g/ml, respectively. Isoglabratephrin demonstrated proapoptotic features, as it induced chromatin dissolution, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation. It also disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential in the treated cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Isoglabratephrin could be a new lead to treat human prostate (PC3) and pancreatic (PANC-1) malignancies.""","""['Loiy Elsir A Hassan', 'Muhammad Adnan Iqbal', 'Saad S Dahham', 'Yasser M Tabana', 'Mohamed B Khadeer Ahamed', 'Amin M S Abdul Majid']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Crystal structure elucidation and anticancer studies of (-)-pseudosemiglabrin: a flavanone isolated from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea.', 'Toxic and antifeedant activities of prenylated flavonoids isolated from Tephrosia apollinea L. against three major coleopteran pests of stored grains with reference to their structure-activity relationship.', 'Rare prenylated flavonoids from Tephrosia purpurea.', 'Recent advance in the research of flavonoids as anticancer agents.', ""The subgroup of 2'-hydroxy-flavonoids: Molecular diversity, mechanism of action, and anticancer properties."", 'Phytochemical Analysis and Profiling of Antioxidants and Anticancer Compounds from Tephrosia purpurea (L.) subsp. apollinea Family Fabaceae.']"""

We hypothesized that a shorter time between radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy might be associated with worse functional recovery rates after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 2,190 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and stratified according to radiotherapy schedule (adjuvant radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy, no radiotherapy). We examined recovery rates for erectile function and urinary function according to adjuvant radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy and no radiotherapy, and according to time from surgery to radiotherapy. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the impact of these predictors on functional outcomes.  Results:   Median followup was 48 months. The 3-year erectile function recovery rates were 35.0%, 29.0% and 11.6% in patients who received no radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy, respectively (p <0.001), and differed significantly according to time to radiotherapy (11.7% vs 34.7% for less than 1 year vs 1 year or more, respectively, p <0.001). The 3-year urinary continence recovery rates were 70.7%, 59.0% and 42.2% in patients who received no radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy, respectively (p <0.001), and differed according to time to radiotherapy (43.5% vs 62.7% for less than 1 year vs 1 year or more, respectively, p <0.001). Cox regression analyses confirmed the negative impact of early radiotherapy on recovery rates for erectile function and urinary continence.  Conclusions:   Time from radical prostatectomy to radiotherapy has an important role in the recovery of erectile function and urinary continence. Delayed radiotherapy is preferred to improve functional outcomes after surgery.""","""['Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Marco Moschini', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Marco Bandini', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy: Balancing Disease Control and Functional Outcomes.', 'How to optimize patient selection for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: functional outcome analyses from a tertiary referral center.', 'Preoperative erectile function represents a significant predictor of postoperative urinary continence recovery in patients treated with bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Repeat prostate biopsies prior to radical prostatectomy do not impact erectile function recovery and mid- to long-term continence.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'WWOX Polymorphisms as Predictors of the Biochemical Recurrence of Localized Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Oncological and functional outcomes of high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer patients after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'A meta-analysis on the use of radiotherapy after prostatectomy: adjuvant versus early salvage radiation.', 'Narrative Review of the Post-Operative Management of Prostate Cancer Patients: Is It Really the End of Adjuvant Radiotherapy?', 'Functional Preservation and Oncologic Control following Robot-Assisted versus Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy for Intermediate- and High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.']"""

We performed a pooled analysis of control arms of randomized trials that either did or did not administer single-agent P to evaluate its impact on overall survival (OS) and toxicities.  Methods:   Individual patient data from control arms of randomized trials of men with mCRPC who received placebo or P+placebo post docetaxel were eligible for analysis. The impact of P on OS and severe toxicities was investigated in Cox regression models adjusted for known prognostic factors. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05 and all tests were two sided.  Results:   Data from the control arms of two randomized phase III trials were available totaling 794 men: the COU-AA-301 trial (n=394) administered P plus placebo and the CA184-043 trial (n=400) administered placebo alone. P plus placebo was not significantly associated with OS compared with placebo in a multivariable analysis (hazard ratio=0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.72-1.10), P=0.27). Other factors associated with poor OS were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-performance status (PS) â©¾1, Gleason score â©¾8, liver metastasis, high PSA, hypoalbuminemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Grade â©¾3 therapy-related toxicities were significantly increased with P plus placebo compared with placebo (hazard ratio=1.48 (95% confidence interval 1.03-2.13), P=0.034).
