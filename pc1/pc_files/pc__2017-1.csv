Methods:   We identified 14,273 men newly diagnosed with LUTI (9347 with cystitis, and 4926 with urethritis) between 1998 and 2011, from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Each patient was randomly frequency-matched with 4 men without LUTI, based on age and index year of diagnosis. Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of LUTI on the PCa risk.  Results:   The risk of developing PCa was significantly higher in the cystitis cohort (adjusted HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.20-1.78) and in the urethritis cohort (adjusted HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.26-2.34) than in the group without LUTI. Further analyses indicated that patients with more than 5 medical visits for LUTI per year had a significantly greater risk of developing PCa.  Conclusion:   We found that cystitis or urethritis may play an etiological role in the development of PCa in Taiwanese men, particularly in those with repeated medical visits for cystitis or urethritis. Further studies are warranted on the association between LUTI and PCa in other countries, particularly where the prevalence of PCa is high.""","""['Chao-Yueh Fan', 'Wen-Yen Huang', 'Kuen-Tze Lin', 'Chun-Shu Lin', 'Hsing-Lung Chao', 'Jen-Fu Yang', 'Cheng-Li Lin', 'Chia-Hung Kao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A case-control study of lower urinary-tract infections, associated antibiotics and the risk of developing prostate cancer using PCBaSe 3.0.', 'Association between gallbladder stone disease and prostate cancer: A nationwide population-based study.', 'Risk of prostate and bladder cancers in patients with spinal cord injury: a population-based cohort study.', 'Association Between Migraine and Breast Cancer Risk: A Population-Based Cohort Study and Literature Review.', 'Cystitis and urethritis.', 'Risks of prostate cancer and mortality in the city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.', 'Prostate cancer management: long-term beliefs, epidemic developments in the early twenty-first century and 3PM dimensional solutions.', 'Prevalence of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria and Antibiotic Susceptibility Patterns of Bacterial Isolates among Cancer Patients and Healthy Blood Donors at the University of Gondar Specialized Hospital.']"""

In addition, KPCRC-HG was validated and compared with internet-based Western risk calculators in a validation cohort.  Materials and methods:   Using a logistic regression model, KPCRC-HG was developed based on the data from 602 previously unscreened Korean men who underwent initial prostate biopsies. Using 2,313 cases in a validation cohort, KPCRC-HG was compared with the European Randomized Study of Screening for PC Risk Calculator for high-grade cancer (ERSPCRC-HG) and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0 for high-grade cancer (PCPTRC-HG). The predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots.  Results:   PC was detected in 172 (28.6%) men, 120 (19.9%) of whom had PC of Gleason score 7 or higher. Independent predictors included prostate-specific antigen levels, digital rectal examination findings, transrectal ultrasound findings, and prostate volume. The AUC of the KPCRC-HG (0.84) was higher than that of the PCPTRC-HG (0.79, p<0.001) but not different from that of the ERSPCRC-HG (0.83) on external validation. Calibration plots also revealed better performance of KPCRC-HG and ERSPCRC-HG than that of PCPTRC-HG on external validation. At a cut-off of 5% for KPCRC-HG, 253 of the 2,313 men (11%) would not have been biopsied, and 14 of the 614 PC cases with Gleason score 7 or higher (2%) would not have been diagnosed.  Conclusions:   KPCRC-HG is the first web-based high-grade prostate cancer prediction model in Korea. It had higher predictive accuracy than PCPTRC-HG in a Korean population and showed similar performance with ERSPCRC-HG in a Korean population. This prediction model could help avoid unnecessary biopsy and reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment in clinical settings.""","""['Jae Young Park', 'Sungroh Yoon', 'Man Sik Park', 'Hoon Choi', 'Jae Hyun Bae', 'Du Geon Moon', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Chanwang Park', 'Seok-Soo Byun']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Development and External Validation of the Korean Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for High-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparison with Two Western Risk Calculators in an Asian Cohort.', 'Can the prostate risk calculator based on Western population be applied to Asian population?', 'Initial biopsy outcome prediction in Korean patients-comparison of a noble web-based Korean prostate cancer risk calculator versus prostate-specific antigen testing.', 'Development and external multicenter validation of Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium prostate cancer risk calculator for initial prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Overview of the development of the Korean exposure factors handbook.', 'Personalized 5-Year Prostate Cancer Risk Prediction Model in Korea Based on Nationwide Representative Data.', 'Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction models in Eastern Asian populations: current status, racial difference, and future directions.', 'Correction: Development and External Validation of the Korean Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for High-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparison with Two Western Risk Calculators in an Asian Cohort.']"""

There is a paucity of studies on the extent to which depression is treated among elderly cancer survivors. Therefore, this study estimated the rates of depression treatment among elderly cancer survivors and identified the factors affecting depression treatment.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study design was adopted, and data were obtained from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare database. Elderly individuals (â¥ 66 years) with incident cases of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer and newly diagnosed depression (N=1,673) were followed for six months after the depression diagnosis to identify depression treatment (antidepressants only, psychotherapy only, combined treatment with both antidepressants and psychotherapy, and no depression treatment). Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze the factors associated with depression treatment.  Results:   In this study population, 46% received antidepressants only, 27% received no treatment, 18% received combined therapy, and 9% received psychotherapy only. Factors associated with depression treatment included anxiety, the percentage of psychologists at the county level, the number of visits to primary care physicians, ongoing cancer treatment, the presence of other chronic conditions, and race-ethnicity.  Conclusions:   The study findings indicate that two-thirds of cancer survivors received depression treatment in the first six months after depression diagnosis. Our study findings indicate that racial-ethnic disparities in depression treatment persist and competing demands for cancer treatment may take priority over depression care. Also, the availability of psychologists may influence receipt of psychotherapy among cancer survivors.""","""['Monira Alwhaibi', 'Suresh Madhavan', 'Thomas Bias', 'Kimberly Kelly', 'Jamie Walkup', 'Usha Sambamoorthi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Psychiatr Serv""","""['Depression treatment and healthcare expenditures among elderly Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed depression and incident breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Type and Risk of Newly Diagnosed Depression Among Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries With Incident Breast, Colorectal, and Prostate Cancers.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of depression in the elderly medicare population: predictors, disparities, and trends.', 'Effectiveness of psychotherapy and combination treatment for chronic depression.', 'Depression and the elderly.', ""The Impact of Depression and Anxiety on Adult Cancer Patients' Health-Related Quality of Life."", 'Antidepressant use pattern and disparities among cancer patients in the United States.', 'Social and medical risk factors associated with supportive needs in the first year following localized prostate cancer treatment.', 'Association between depression and healthcare expenditures among elderly cancer patients.', 'Mental Health Issues in Racial and Ethnic Minority Elderly.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively selected 47 metastatic PCa patients treated at a single center (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) by two urologists (RJK and EK) between 2007 and 2014. Overall, 31 (66%) underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without adjuvant therapies and 16 (34%) underwent ADT only. Surgical patients were treated by a single surgeon (RJK). Complications and functional outcomes were recorded for surgery group. Cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimation. Univariable Cox regression analyses were used to test the risk factors associated with CSM in mPCa patients treated with RP.  Results:   Median age at diagnosis was 61 years. During median follow-up 38.8 months, 12 deaths were recorded. At 5 years, the overall CSM-free survival rate of the whole cohort was 57.9%. When patients were stratified according to the treatment, CSM-free survival rate at 5 years was 62% and 46% for patients who underwent surgery and ADT, respectively (P=0.3). Median length of stay was 3 days, with a 30 days readmission rate of 9.7%. The 30-day all complication rate was 29% (n=9).

Methods:   Records from 1993 to 2014 were reviewed for men who underwent radiotherapy for prostate cancer at age 75 years or older. Patients were classified into one of four groups based on PSA-testing history: (1) no PSA testing; (2) incomplete/ineffective PSA testing; (3) PSA testing; or (4) cannot be determined. Outcomes of interest were National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group (that is, low, intermediate or high risk) and biopsy grade at diagnosis.

The conventional inverse treatment planning of IMPT based on the planning target volume (PTV) is not often sufficient to ensure robustness of treatment plans. We applied a probabilistic framework (chance-constrained optimization) in IMPT planning to hedge against the influence of uncertainties.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively selected one patient with lung cancer, one patient with head and neck (H&N) cancer, and one with prostate cancer for this analysis. Using their original images and prescriptions, we created new IMPT plans using two methods: (1) a robust chance-constrained treatment planning method with the clinical target volume (CTV) as the target; (2) the margin-based method with PTV as the target, which was solved by commercial software, CPLEX, using linear programming. For the first method, we reformulated the model into a tractable mixed-integer programming problem and sped up the calculation using Benders decomposition. The dose-volume histograms (DVHs) from the nominal and perturbed dose distributions were used to assess and compare plan quality. DVHs for all uncertain scenarios along with the nominal DVH were plotted. The width of the ""bands"" of DVHs was used to quantify the plan sensitivity to uncertainty. The newly developed Benders decomposition method was compared with a commercial solution to demonstrate its computational efficiency. The trade-off between nominal plan quality and plan robustness was investigated.  Results:   Our chance-constrained model outperformed the PTV method in terms of tumor coverage, tumor dose homogeneity, and plan robustness. Our model was shown to produce IMPT plans to meet the dose-volume constraints of organs at risk (OARs) and had better sparing of OARs than the PTV method in the three clinical cases included in this study. The chance-constrained model provided a flexible tool for users to balance between plan robustness and plan quality. In addition, our in-house developed method was found to be much faster than the commercial solution.  Conclusion:   With explicit control of plan robustness, the chance-constrained robust optimization model generated superior IMPT plans compared to the PTV-based method.""","""['Yu An', 'Jianming Liang', 'Steven E Schild', 'Martin Bues', 'Wei Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'A novel and individualized robust optimization method using normalized dose interval volume constraints (NDIVC) for intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Virtual particle Monte Carlo: A new concept to avoid simulating secondary particles in proton therapy dose calculation.', 'Empirical Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for Mandible Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Pencil-Beam-Scanning Proton Therapy (PBSPT): A Retrospective, Case-Matched Cohort Study.', 'A Critical Review of LET-Based Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy Plan Evaluation and Optimization for Head and Neck Cancer Management.']"""

Activation of inflammatory signaling pathway and initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are closely related to drug resistance, tumor relapseas well as metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of inhibiting prostate cancer cell migration and invasion by repressing EMT evidenced by downregulating the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Twist and upregulating the epithelium E-cadherin. These effects have also been observed in our animal model as well as prostate cancer patients. In addition, we showed the effects of metformin on the expression of genes involved in EMT through repressing the levels of COX2, PGE2 and phosphorylated STAT3. Furthermore, inactivating COX2 abolishes metformin's regulatory effects and exogenously administered PGE2 is capable of enhancing STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of EMT biomarker. We propose that metformin represses prostate cancer EMT and metastasis through targeting the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis.

Twelve articles, including 14 case-control studies (2,215 cases and 2,481 controls), were included in our study. Surprisingly, different from previous meta-analyses, no significant association between Axin2 rs2240308 polymorphism and cancer risk was observed (dominant model: OR=0.85; 95% CI=0.68-1.06). In further stratified analyses, rs2240308 was significantly associated with a decreased cancer risk only in Asians (dominant model: OR=0.76; 95% CI=0.66-0.88), while for Caucasians the variant showed no significant association with cancer risk (dominant model: OR=1.09; 95% CI=0.67-1.76). Moreover, the rs2240308 variant exhibited a significant association with a decreased risk of lung cancer and prostate cancer. These findings provided new evidence that differed from previous meta-analyses; Axin2 rs2240308 may not modify general cancer susceptibility. Similar with previous meta-analyses, our analysis indicated that Axin2 rs2240308 may modify cancer susceptibility in an ethnicity- and/or type-specific manner.

Its antitumor and chemopreventive activities have been associated with diverse effects on cell cycle, apoptosis, and receptor-dependent mitogenic signaling pathways. Here we hypothesized that silibinin's pleiotropic effects may reflect its interference with epigenetic mechanisms in human prostate cancer cells. More specifically, we have demonstrated that silibinin reduces gene expression levels of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) members Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), Suppressor of Zeste Homolog 12 (SUZ12), and Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) in DU145 and PC3 human prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that silibinin-mediated reduction of EZH2 levels was accompanied by an increase in trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine (Î)-27 residue (H3K27me3) levels and that such response was, in part, dependent on decreased expression levels of phosphorylated Akt (ser473) (pAkt) and phosphorylated EZH2 (ser21) (pEZH2). Additionally silibinin exerted other epigenetic effects involving an increase in total DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity while it decreased histone deacetylases 1-2 (HDACs1-2) expression levels. We conclude that silibinin induces epigenetic alterations in human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that subsequent disruptions of central processes in chromatin conformation may account for some of its diverse anticancer effects.""","""['Ioannis Anestopoulos', 'Aristeidis P Sfakianos', 'Rodrigo Franco', 'Katerina Chlichlia', 'Mihalis I Panayiotidis', 'David J Kroll', 'Aglaia Pappa']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Down-regulation of human DAB2IP gene expression mediated by polycomb Ezh2 complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer.', 'Ubiquitous expressed transcript promotes tumorigenesis by acting as a positive modulator of the polycomb repressive complex 2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Combined inhibition of EZH2 and histone deacetylases as a potential epigenetic therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer cells.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Metabolo-epigenetic interplay provides targeted nutritional interventions in chronic diseases and ageing.', 'An insight into the mechanisms of action of selected bioactive compounds against epigenetic targets of prostate cancer: implications on histones modifications.', 'Trained immunity in monocyte/macrophage: Novel mechanism of phytochemicals in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.', 'Evaluation of Silibinin Effect on U-CH2 and MCF-7 Cell Lines through xCELLigence System.', 'Natural Bioactive Compounds Targeting Histone Deacetylases in Human Cancers: Recent Updates.']"""

The Monte Carlo (MC) method can be used to simulate probabilities and outcomes of individual patients and offers an attractive option for application of DCA.  Materials and methods:   We constructed a MC decision model to simulate individual probabilities of outcomes of interest. These probabilities were contrasted against the threshold probability at which a decision-maker is indifferent between key management strategies: treat all, treat none or use predictive model to guide treatment. We compared the results of DCA with MC simulated data against the results of DCA based on actual individual patient data for three decision models published in the literature: (i) statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, (ii) hospice referral for terminally ill patients and (iii) prostate cancer surgery.  Results:   The results of MC DCA and patient data DCA were identical. To the extent that patient data DCA were used to inform decisions about statin use, referral to hospice or prostate surgery, the results indicate that MC DCA could have also been used. As long as the aggregate parameters on distribution of the probability of outcomes and treatment effects are accurately described in the published reports, the MC DCA will generate indistinguishable results from individual patient data DCA.

We compared 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for diagnosis and tumour delineation in patients with primary PCa based on slice by slice correlation with histopathological reference material.  Methodology:   Seven patients with histopathologically proven primary PCa underwent 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT and MRI followed by radical prostatectomy. Resected prostates were scanned by ex-vivo CT in a special localizer and prepared for histopathology. Invasive PCa was delineated on a HE stained histologic tissue slide and matched to ex-vivo CT to obtain gross tumor volume (GTV-)histo. Ex-vivo CT including GTV-histo and MRI data were matched to in-vivo CT(PET). Consensus contours based on MRI (GTV-MRI), PSMA PET (GTV-PET) or the combination of both (GTV-union/-intersection) were created. In each in-vivo CT slice the prostate was separated into 4 equal segments and sensitivity and specificity for PSMA PET and mpMRI were assessed by comparison with histological reference material. Furthermore, the spatial overlap between GTV-histo and GTV-PET/-MRI and the SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) were calculated. In the case of multifocal PCa (4/7 patients), SUV values (PSMA PET) and ADC-values (diffusion weighted MRI) were obtained for each lesion.  Results:   PSMA PET and mpMRI detected PCa in all patients. GTV-histo was detected in 225 of 340 segments (66.2%). Sensitivity and specificity for GTV-PET, GTV-MRI, GTV-union and GTV-intersection were 75% and 87%, 70% and 82%, 82% and 67%, 55% and 99%, respectively. GTV-histo had on average the highest overlap with GTV-union (57Â±22%), which was significantly higher than overlap with GTV-MRI (p=0.016) and GTV-PET (p=0.016), respectively. The mean DSC for GTV-union, GTV-PET and GTV-MRI was 0.51 (Â±0.18), 0.45 (Â±0.17) and 0.48 (Â±0.19), respectively. In every patient with multifocal PCa there was one lesion which had both the highest SUV and the lowest ADC-value (mean and max).  Conclusion:   In a slice by slice analysis with histopathology, 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI showed high sensitivity and specificity in detection of primary PCa. A combination of both methods performed even better in terms of sensitivity (GTV-union) and specificity (GTV-intersection). A moderate to good spatial overlap with GTV-histo was observed for PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI alone which was significantly improved by GTV-union.

Additional in vitro and in vivo assays showed that CD54 played a critical role in the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of prostate CSCs. Moreover, silencing CD54 greatly reduced the tumorigenesis of prostate cancers both in vitro and in vivo and significantly extended the survival time of tumor-bearing mice in a prostate cancer xenograft model. Dissection of the molecular mechanism revealed that the p38-Notch1 axis was the main downstream signaling pathway in CD54-mediated regulation of CSCs in prostate cancers.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel-based chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone in CRPC patients.  Materials and methods:   This study was a single-arm multi-institutional phase II trial.

Treatment was planned for 10 cycles, and continued for at least four cycles depending on the observation of PSA flare. The primary endpoint was PSA response defined as a reduction from baseline of at least 50% that continued for at least 3 weeks. Secondary endpoints were safety, PSA flare, time to PSA failure and adherence rate to protocol treatment (10 cycles).

PSA response rate was 76.8% (90% confidence interval (CI): 66.9-84.9). Of all patients, 30 patients completed 10 cycles of chemotherapy (40%). The incidence rate of PSA flare was 10.7% (eight patients). The median time to PSA failure was 369 days (95% CI: 245-369). The most frequently observed adverse event was hematotoxicity (neutropenia of G2 or greater: 100%).  Conclusions:   The present study showed a significantly high PSA response compared with previous reports. Most patients tolerated the protocol treatment well, whereas hematotoxicity was often observed.""","""['Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Kazuo Nishimura', 'Eijiro Okajima', 'Kenji Ina', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Hirohiko Nagata', 'Koichiro Akakura', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto', 'Momokazu Gotoh', 'Satoshi Teramukai', 'Yoshihiko Hirao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['A narrative review of the role of glucocorticoid receptors in prostate cancer: developments in last 5 years.', 'Weekly low-dose docetaxel combined with estramustine and dexamethasone for Japanese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Docetaxel-based chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone 1\xa0mg daily oral administration for castration-resistant prostate cancer: Long-term outcomes.', 'Changes in fPSA level could discriminate tPSA flare-up from tPSA progression in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer during the initial phase of docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The role of other physician specialists in this setting is less clear. We investigated whether involvement of other physician specialty types immediately following diagnosis affects initiation of cancer-directed treatment.  Methods:   This is a retrospective cohort study using linked cancer registry and claims data from 1999 to 2009, excluding stage I/II PCa. A physician visit index (PVI) served as the exposure variable and captured the ""dispersion of care"" across specialties, that is, the extent to which patient care involved different types of physician specialties such as the primary care physician, urologist, or oncologist. The PVI score was calculated using visits occurring within 30 days postdiagnosis. This score was dichotomized to measure ""low PVI"" (reflects seeing multiple specialist types). Competing risk Cox proportional hazard regression models provided adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for treatment receipt associated with a low PVI.  Results:   The sample included 33,380 patients: 4,910 metastatic and 28,470 nonmetastatic groups. The top 3 visit categories within 30 days postdiagnosis were ""urologist only"" (59%) and ""urologist plus primary care physician"" (21%) and no visit (6%). The median time to receipt of cancer-directed treatment was 51 days. Overall, 29% of individuals in the metastatic group and 38% in the nonmetastatic group were categorized as low PVI. A low PVI was associated with a shorter time to treatment receipt in the nonmetastatic (HR = 1.12 [95% CI: 1.09-1.15]) and metastatic (HR = 1.21 [95% CI: 1.14-1.29]) groups.  Conclusions:   Multispecialist involvement in the weeks following diagnosis is associated with a shorter time to treatment initiation, highlighting a role for exposure to different specialty types in the weeks following an initial diagnosis of PCa.

Here, we show that an intrinsic constitutively activated feedforward signaling circuit composed of IÎºBÎ±/NF-ÎºB(p65), miR-196b-3p, Meis2, and PPP3CC is formed during the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This circuit controls the expression of stem cell transcription factors that drives the high tumorigenicity of CRPC cells. Interrupting the circuit by targeting its individual components significantly impairs the tumorigenicity and CRPC development. Notably, constitutive activation of IÎºBÎ±/NF-ÎºB(p65) in this circuit is not dependent on the activation of traditional IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB pathways that are important in normal immune responses. Therefore, our studies present deep insight into the bona fide mechanisms underlying castration resistance and provide the foundation for the development of CRPC therapeutic strategies that would be highly efficient while avoiding indiscriminate IKK/NF-ÎºB inhibition in normal cells.""","""['Ji-Hak Jeong', 'Sun-Jin Park', 'Shohreh Iravani Dickinson', 'Jun-Li Luo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cell""","""['A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'CIP2A is a candidate therapeutic target in clinically challenging prostate cancer cell populations.', 'CX4945 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing AR-V7 expression.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'NF-ÎºB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'A noval prognostic signature of the N7-methylguanosine (m7G)-related miRNA in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Tumor-derived OBP2A promotes prostate cancer castration resistance.', 'Regulation of Tumor and Metastasis Initiation by Chemokine Receptors.']"""

The recent emergence of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to investigate tumor physiology can be used to verify the response of human tumors to HD IGRT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the near-immediate effects of HD IGRT on spine metastases through the use of DCE MRI perfusion studies. METHODS Six patients with spine metastases from prostate, thyroid, and renal cell carcinoma who underwent HD IGRT were studied using DCE MRI prior to and 1 hour after HD IGRT. The DCE perfusion parameters plasma volume (Vp) and vascular permeability (Ktrans) were measured to assess the near-immediate and long-term tumor response. A Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare significant changes (at p â¤ 0.05) in perfusion parameters before and after RT. RESULTS The authors observed a precipitous drop in Vp within 1 hour of HD IGRT, with a mean decrease of 65.2%. A significant difference was found between Vp values for before and 1 hour after RT (p â¤ 0.05). No significant change was seen in Vp (p = 0.31) and Ktrans (p = 0.1) from 1 hour after RT to the first follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that there is an immediate effect of HD IGRT on the vascularity of spine metastases, as demonstrated by a precipitous decrease in Vp. The DCE MRI studies can detect such changes within 1 hour after RT, and findings are concordant with existing animal models.""","""['Eric Lis', 'Atin Saha', 'Kyung K Peck', 'Joan Zatcky', 'Michael J Zelefsky', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Andrei I Holodny', 'Mark H Bilsky', 'Sasan Karimi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neurosurg Focus""","""['Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging measurements in renal cell carcinoma: effect of region of interest size and positioning on interobserver and intraobserver variability.', 'Measurement of blood perfusion in spinal metastases with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: evaluation of tumor response to radiation therapy.', 'Reproducibility of the aortic input function (AIF) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the kidneys in a volunteer study.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for assessing tumor vascularity and vascular effects of targeted therapies in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Value of DCE-MRI for staging and response evaluation in rectal cancer: A systematic review.', 'Delay of Aortic Arterial Input Function Time Improves Detection of Malignant Vertebral Body Lesions on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Perfusion.', 'Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Imaging on Sacroiliitis in Patients With Axial Spondyloarthritis: Correlation With Perfusion Characteristics Based on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Quantifying lumbar vertebral perfusion by a Tofts model on DCE-MRI using segmental versus aortic arterial input function.', 'The importance of multidisciplinary care for spine metastases: initial tumor management.', 'T1-weighted Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI to Differentiate Nonneoplastic and Malignant Vertebral Body Lesions in the Spine.']"""

Methods:   A Markov model was calibrated to the EORTC 22991 trial, which randomly assigned men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer to radiation therapy (RT) with or without six months of hormonal therapy (HT). We compared quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in men age 50, 60, and 70 years by age decile and cardiac risk group. Competing risks of cardiovascular mortality were estimated from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the impact of varying model assumptions.  Results:   HT was associated with a net decrease of 0.3 to 0.4 QALYs in men with a history of myocardial infarction. However, for all other men, HT improved QALYs (range = 0.4-2.6 QALYs). Younger men with fewer cardiac risk factors experienced the largest benefit from HT. In sensitivity analyses, the model was only found to be sensitive to the probability of biochemical failure. Men at low risk for biochemical failure (â¤8.7% at five years) did not benefit from HT. Further, the benefits of HT did not begin to manifest until after 7.3 years of follow-up.  Conclusions:   The optimal choice of therapy depends upon age, cardiac risk, and disease recurrence risk.

Purpose:   To examine the variations in the risk of newly diagnosed depression by cancer type among elderly individuals with cancer.  Methods:   This study used a retrospective cohort study design and data from the linked SEER-Medicare files. Elderly individuals (age >65 years) with incident breast, colorectal (CRC), and prostate cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 (N=53,821) were followed for 12 months after cancer diagnosis.

Complementary log-log regression was used to examine the association between cancer type and risk of newly diagnosed depression after adjusting for other risk factors for depression.  Results:   We found a significantly higher percentage of newly diagnosed depression among women with CRC compared with those with breast cancer (5.8% vs 3.9%), and among men with CRC compared with those with prostate cancer (3.4% vs 1.6%). In the adjusted analysis, women with CRC had a 28.0% higher risk of newly diagnosed depression compared with women with breast cancer (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.46) and men with CRC had a 104.0% higher risk of newly diagnosed depression compared with those with prostate cancer (ARR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.65-2.51).

Although the risk of ONJ increases with increasing duration of BP treatment, there are currently no reliable estimates of the ONJ time to onset (TTO). The objective of this study was to estimate the TTO and associated risk factors in BP-treated patients.  Subjects and methods:   Retrospective analysis of data from 22 secondary care centres in seven countries relevant to 349 patients who developed BP-related ONJ between 2004 and 2012.  Results:   The median (95%CI) TTO was 6.0 years in patients treated with alendronate (n = 88) and 2.2 years in those treated with zoledronate (n = 218). Multivariable Cox regression showed that dentoalveolar surgery was inversely associated, and the use of antiangiogenics directly associated, with the TTO in patients with cancer treated with zoledronate.  Conclusions:   The incidence of ONJ increases with the duration of BP therapy, with notable differences observed with respect to BP type and potency, route of administration and underlying disease. When data are stratified by BP type, a time of 6.0 and 2.2 years of oral alendronate and intravenous zoledronate therapy, respectively, is required for 50% of patients to develop ONJ.

Multiparametric (mp-)MRI is increasingly used for tumor detection and localization in prostate because of its ability to visualize tissue structure and to reveal tumor characteristics. However, it can be challenging to distinguish cancer, particularly in the transition zone. In this study, we enhance the performance of a mp-MRI-based tumor localization model by incorporating prior knowledge from two sources: a population-based tumor probability atlas and patient-specific biopsy examination results. This information typically would be considered by a physician when carrying out a manual tumor delineation.  Materials and methods:   Our study involves 40 patients from two centers: 23 patients from the University Hospital Leuven (Leuven), Leuven, Belgium and 17 patients from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All patients received a mp-MRI exam consisting of a T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI before prostatectomy. Thirty-one features were extracted for each voxel in the prostate. Among these, 29 were from the multiparametric-MRI, one was from the population-based tumor probability atlas and one from the biopsy map. T2-weighted images of each patient were registered to whole-mount section pathology slices to obtain the ground truth. The study was validated in two settings: single-center (training and test sets were from the same cohort); and cross-center (training and test sets were from different cohorts). In addition, automatic delineations created by our model were compared with manual tumor delineations done by six different teams on a subset of Leuven cohort including 15 patients.  Results:   In the single-center setting, mp-MRI-based features yielded area under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.690 on a pooled set of patients from both cohorts. Including prevalence into mp-MRI-based features increased the AUC to 0.751 and including all features achieved the best performance with AUC of 0.775. Using all features always showed better results when varying the size of the training set. In addition, its performance is comparable with the average performance of six teams delineating the tumors manually. The error rate using all features was 0.22. The two prior knowledge features ranked among the top four most important features out of the 31 features. In the cross-center setting, combining all features also yielded the best performance in terms of the mean AUC of 0.777 on the pooled set of patients from both cohorts. In addition, the difference in performance between the single-center setting and cross-center setting was not significant.  Conclusions:   The results showed significant improvements when including prior knowledge features in addition to mp-MRI-based features in both single- and cross-center settings.""","""['Cuong Viet Dinh', 'Peter Steenbergen', 'Ghazaleh Ghobadi', 'Henk van der Poel', 'Stijn W T P J Heijmink', 'Jeroen de Jong', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Raymond Oyen', 'Yangming Ou', 'Davatzikos Christos', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI Tumor Probability Model for the Detection of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy: Pathologic Validation and Comparison With Manual Tumor Delineations.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: detection and localization with 3-T multiparametric MR imaging.', 'Development of a registration framework to validate MRI with histology for prostate focal therapy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Normalization Strategies in Multi-Center Radiomics Abdominal MRI: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.', 'Improving liver tumor image contrast and synthesizing novel tissue contrasts by adaptive multiparametric MRI fusion.', 'Introducing new plan evaluation indices for prostate dose painting IMRT plans based on apparent diffusion coefficient images.', 'A statistical, voxelised model of prostate cancer for biologically optimised radiotherapy.', 'Basic concepts and applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

Men with prostate cancer (N = 43) completed measures of quality of life (QOL), spiritual well-being in two domains (i.e., Faith and Meaning/Peace), psychological state, and psychological trait before undergoing radiotherapy. We hypothesized that (1) higher existential Meaning/Peace would correlate with higher QOL and psychological trait protective factors (e.g., Agreeableness) and that (2) higher existential Meaning/Peace would correlate with lower depression, anxiety, and Neuroticism (i.e., a psychological trait risk factor). We did not anticipate similar relationships between religious Faith and QOL, depression, anxiety, or psychological traits and consider related analyses to be exploratory in nature. Meaning/Peace was indeed negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and Neuroticism. Meaning/Peace was positively correlated with Physical, Social, Functional, and Emotional well-being, as well as Extraversion. Religious Faith was positively associated with Functional well-being, but not the other state, trait, or QOL domains. In sum, prostate cancer patients' sense of existential Meaning/Peace prior to radiotherapy was associated with well-being in many domains, whereas religious Faith appeared less so.""","""['Sara J Walker', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Kyungjeen Paik', 'Brandy Mirly', 'Charles R Thomas Jr', 'Arthur Y Hung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Relig Health""","""['Mediating effect of interpersonal coping on meaning in spirituality and quality of life and the influences of depression and anxiety thereon in cancer patients.', 'A 3-factor model for the FACIT-Sp.', 'Changes in spiritual well-being and psychological outcomes in ovarian cancer survivors.', 'Associations between psychological factors and health-related quality of life and global quality of life in patients with ALS: a systematic review.', 'A systematic review of associations between spiritual well-being and quality of life at the scale and factor levels in studies among patients with cancer.', 'Associations Between Psycho-Social-Spiritual Interventions, Fewer Aggressive End-of-Life Measures, and Increased Time After Final Oncologic Treatment.', 'What Aspects of Religion and Spirituality Affect the Physical Health of Cancer Patients?

Objective:   To develop new risk assessment models to overcome the diagnostic limitation of PSA and reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in North Chinese patients with 4-50 ng/mL PSA.  Methods:   A total of 702 patients in seven hospitals with 4-10 and 10-50 ng/mL PSA, respectively, who had undergone transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies, were assessed. Analysis-modeling stage for several clinical indexes related to prostate cancer and renal function was carried out. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to develop new risk assessment models of prostate cancer for both PSA level ranges 4-10 and 10-50 ng/mL. External validation stage of the new models was performed to assess the necessity of biopsy.  Results:   The new models for both PSA ranges performed significantly better than PSA for detecting prostate cancers. Both models showed higher areas under the curves (0.937 and 0.873, respectively) compared with PSA alone (0.624 and 0.595), at pre-determined cut-off values of 0.1067 and 0.6183, respectively.

To clarify the mechanisms leading to this disparity, we analyzed the potential involvement of miR-34b expression in African-Americans and Caucasians. miR-34b functions as a tumor suppressor and has a multi-functional role, through regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. We found that miR-34b expression is lower in human prostate cancer tissues from African-Americans compared to Caucasians. DNA hypermethylation of the miR-34b-3p promoter region showed significantly higher methylation in prostate cancer compared to normal samples. We then sequenced the promoter region of miR-34b-3p and found a chromosomal deletion in miR-34b in African-American prostate cancer cell line (MDA-PCA-2b) and not in Caucasian cell line (DU-145). We found that AR and ETV1 genes are differentially expressed in MDA-PCa-2b and DU-145 cells after overexpression of miR-34b. Direct interaction of miR-34b with the 3' untranslated region of AR and ETV1 was validated by luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-34b downregulation in African-Americans is inversely correlated with high AR levels that lead to increased cell proliferation. Overexpression of miR-34b in cell lines showed higher inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis and G1 arrest in the African-American cells (MDA-PCa-2b) compared to Caucasian cell line (DU-145).

We recently discovered that TRPM8 is an ionotropic testosterone receptor. This finding suggested that testosterone-induced TRPM8 activity regulates Ca2+ homeostasis in the prostate epithelium. Since androgens are significantly implicated in prostate cancer development, the role of the novel testosterone receptor TRPM8 in cancer was assessed in our study. Although TRPM8 mRNA levels increase at the early prostate cancer stages, we found that it is not proportionally translated into TRPM8 protein levels. High-throughput proteome analysis revealed that TRPM8 degradation is enhanced in human prostate cancer cells. This degradation is executed via a dual degradation mechanism with the involvement of both lysosomal and proteasomal proteolytic pathways. The evaluation of the TRPM8 expression pattern in prostate cancer patients further confirmed the incidence of TRPM8 removal from the plasma membrane and its internalization pattern coincided with the severity of the tumor. Together, our results indicate that enhanced TRPM8 hydrolysis in prostate cancer could present an adaptation mechanism, sustained via bypassing testosterone-induced rapid Ca2+ uptake through TRPM8, thus, diminishing the rates of apoptosis.

One patient stopped treatment after one dose because of an acute infection and was reenrolled after recovery; each course was analyzed as a separate patient entry. Two patients had dose-limiting toxicity (reversible increases in serum creatinine or calculated serum creatinine clearance) at the 3.1 mg/m2 level. Probable or possible study drug-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients [anemia (n = 2), decreased creatinine clearance, dyspnea, hyponatremia, and lymphopenia].

SIPI takes non-hierarchical models, inheritance modes and mode coding direction into consideration. The simulation results show that SIPI has higher power than MDR (Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction), AA_Full, Geno_Full (full interaction model with additive or genotypic mode) and SNPassoc in detecting interactions. Applying SIPI to the prostate cancer PRACTICAL consortium data with approximately 21 000 patients, the four SNP pairs in EGFR-EGFR , EGFR-MMP16 and EGFR-CSF1 were found to be associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness with the exact or similar pattern in the discovery and validation sets.

We assessed the effects of same-day pegfilgrastim, a neutrophil stimulator, after cabazitaxel treatment with or without carboplatin in patients with mCRPC. We also evaluated the frequency of urinary tract inflammation during treatment.  Patients and methods:   Between September 2010 and September 2014, 151 consecutive patients with mCRPC underwent cabazitaxel treatment with or without the addition of carboplatin at a single institution. We assessed absolute neutrophil count recovery, incidence of neutropenia, neutropenic fever, antibiotic usage, treatment delays or discontinuation, dose reduction, and hospitalization with pegfilgrastim administration. Radiologists blinded to therapy reviewed computed tomography scans to detect urinary tract inflammation.  Results:   The median patient age was 69 years (range, 41-88 years); 78% of patients were white, and 54% had a Gleason score â¥ 9. Median overall survival was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 8-11 months). One patient (< 1%) had neutropenia; 38 patients (25%) had infection. During cycle 1, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving pegfilgrastim after 24 hours developed infection than did those receiving pegfilgrastim the same day (26% vs. 6%; P = .01).  Conclusion:   Same-day pegfilgrastim administration after cabazitaxel treatment with or without carboplatin in patients with mCRPC is feasible.

As with any other method based on 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it faces the challenge of low thermal polarization and a subsequent low signal-to-noise ratio due to the relatively low gyromagnetic ratio of 13C and its low natural abundance in biological samples. By overcoming these limitations, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) with subsequent sample dissolution has recently enabled commonly used NMR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems to measure, study, and image key metabolic pathways in various biological systems. A particularly interesting and promising molecule used in 13CMRSI is [1-13C]pyruvate, which, in the last ten years, has been widely used for in vitro, preclinical, and, more recently, clinical studies to investigate the cellular energy metabolism in cancer and other diseases. In this article, we outline the technique of dissolution DNP using a 3.35 T preclinical DNP hyperpolarizer and demonstrate its usage in in vitro studies. A similar protocol for hyperpolarization may be applied for the most part in in vivo studies as well.

Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been proven to be a promising anticancer agent in vitro as well as in vivo in accumulating data. However, the detailed mechanisms of how DHA action in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DHA, a novel anticancer agent, by inhibiting the expression of ubiquitin like containing PHD and ring finger 1 (UHRF1) in PC-3 cells. The apoptosis and cell-cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to examine both UHRF1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expressions at mRNA levels, whereas the expressions of UHRF1, DNMT1, and p16 proteins at protein levels were detected by Western blotting. Methylation levels of p16 CpG islands were determined by bisulfite genomic sequencing. We showed that DHA induced the downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1, accompanied by an upregulation of p16 in PC-3 cells. Decreased p16 promoter methylation levels in DHA-treated groups were also observed in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, DHA significantly induced apoptosis and G1/S cell-cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. Our results suggested that downregulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 is upstream to many cellular events, including G1 cell arrest, demethylation of p16, and apoptosis. Together, our study provides new evidence that DHA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shijuan Du', 'Ge Xu', 'Wenqin Zou', 'Tingxiu Xiang', 'Ziguo Luo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Thymoquinone Is a Multitarget Single Epidrug That Inhibits the UHRF1 Protein Complex.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate up-regulates tumor suppressor gene expression via a reactive oxygen species-dependent down-regulation of UHRF1.', 'Dihydroartemisinin induces cell apoptosis through repression of UHRF1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Luteolin induces apoptosis in BE colorectal cancer cells by downregulating calpain, UHRF1, and DNMT1 expressions.', 'Coordinated Dialogue between UHRF1 and DNMT1 to Ensure Faithful Inheritance of Methylated DNA Patterns.', 'An Epigenetic Role of Mitochondria in Cancer.', 'Dihydroartemisinin induces apoptosis and downregulates glucose metabolism in JF-305 pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Dihydroartemisinin: A Potential Drug for the Treatment of Malignancies and Inflammatory Diseases.', 'Thymoquinone Is a Multitarget Single Epidrug That Inhibits the UHRF1 Protein Complex.', 'Epigenetic mechanism and target therapy of UHRF1 protein complex in malignancies.']"""

This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor SOX2, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting SOX2 expression.

Results:   Of 118 men with PHI testing who underwent biopsy, 47 (39.8%) were found to have clinically significant PCa on biopsy.

We correlated the occurrence of any deletion with pathological stage, Gleason score, ISUP grade group, PSA and biochemical recurrence.  Results:   We observed a loss of any probe in only 8 patients (7.2%). The most common deletion was the loss of locus 9p21, which occurred in 6.4% of cases.

B-mode US was graded into: Grade 1, homogeneous fibrillar pattern; grade 2, hypoechoic areas and/or calcifications <30%; and grade 3 > 30%. SEL was graded into: Grade 1 indicated blue (hardest) to green (hard); grade 2 yellow (soft); and grade 3 red (softest). B-mode US, SEL, and a combined grading score incorporating both were compared to histological findings in 76 biopsies.  Results:   Histological alterations were detected in 55/76 biopsies. Both modalities showed similar results (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 84%, 81%, and 83% for B-mode US versus 85%, 86%, and 86% for SEL, respectively, P > 0.3). However, a combination of both resulted in significant improvement in sensitivity (96%, P < 0.02) without significant change in specificity (81%, P < 0.3), yielding an improved overall accuracy (92%).

Methods:   Kiwi fruit were fixed with gel hot and cold compress packs on two plastic nursery pots, separated by a plastic plate, and submerged in tap water inside a 1-L open-spout plastic watering can for T2WI (TR/TE 7500/101 ms), DWI (5500/61 ms, ADC b50-800 s/mm2 map) and MRS (940/145 ms) at 3.0 T, with phased array surface coils. One green kiwi fruit was additionally examined with an endorectal coil. Retrospective comparison with benign peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) of prostate (n = 5), Gleason 6-7a prostate cancer (n = 8) and Gleason 7b-9 prostate cancer (n = 7) validated the phantom.  Results:   Mean contrast between central placenta (CP) and outer pericarp (OP, 0.346-0.349) or peripheral placenta (PP, 0.364-0.393) of kiwi fruit was similar to Gleason 7b-9 prostate cancer and PZ (0.308) in T2WI.

Gleason grading is an important predictor of prostate cancer outcomes and is influential in determining patient treatment options. Clinical decisions based on a Gleason score of 7 are difficult as the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with Gleason 4+3 cancer is much worse than for those diagnosed with Gleason 3+4 cancer. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is a highly precise method to isolate specific cell populations or discrete microregions from tissues. This report undertook a detailed molecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer to define the proteome in the epithelial and stromal regions from tumor foci of Gleason grades 3 and 4. Tissue regions of interest were isolated from several Gleason 3+3 and Gleason 4+4 tumors using telepathology to leverage specialized pathology expertise to support LCM. Over 2,000 proteins were identified following liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of all regions of interest. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in protein expression (>100 proteins) between Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 regions-in both stromal and epithelial compartments. A subset of these proteins has had prior strong association with prostate cancer, thereby providing evidence for the authenticity of the approach. Finally, validation of these proteins by immunohistochemistry has been obtained using an independent cohort of prostate cancer tumor specimens.Implications: This unbiased strategy provides a strong foundation for the development of biomarker protein panels with significant diagnostic and prognostic potential.

Palmer's point, located in the left upper quadrant, has been reported as an alternative access site for pelvic laparoscopy to reduce morbidity, but not widely reported among urologists. To better understand surgeons' preferences for access and its associated morbidity during RARP, we surveyed surgeons from two urologic organizations.  Methods:   An anonymous online questionnaire (SurveyMonkey) consisting of 17 questions that assessed training, experience, and preferences for RARP was emailed in December 2014 and collected until February 2015 to members performing RARP of the Endourology Society (ES) and the Michigan Urological Society Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC). Surgeons were also asked to share their personal experience with a vascular, death or life-threatening event (DOLTE), or bowel injury during RARP.  Results:   Questionnaires were answered by 111 surgeons in total (ES, n = 71 and MUSIC, n = 40) with an estimated total response rate of 5.5%. In total, 77% reported prior experience with the Veress needle method before exposure to RARP and 71% of respondents primarily use the Veress needle for RARP, with 73% reporting access primarily at the periumbilical location. A personal experience with a vascular or a bowel injury during Veress needle insertion was reported in 18% and 9% of surgeons, respectively; furthermore, 26% of respondents were personally aware of at least 1 DOLTE among colleagues (5% reported 3 or more). The majority (56%) of respondents were unaware of Palmer's point, while among the minority aware of Palmer's point, only 33% reported ever using this location.  Conclusion:   In this survey, surgeons most commonly access the abdomen at the periumbilical location with a Veress needle for RARP with the majority not aware or utilizing Palmer's point. Nearly one in five surgeons reported a personal experience with a vascular injury during access for RARP. Palmer's point, located away from major vasculature, may reduce the morbidity of access for RARP and warrants further awareness and study.""","""['William K Johnston rd', 'Susan Linsell', 'David Miller', 'Khurshid R Ghani']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""[""Primary left upper quadrant (Palmer's point) access for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy."", 'A Critical Analysis of the Learning Curve and Postlearning Curve Outcomes of Two Experience- and Volume-Matched Surgeons for Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', ""Latif's point: A new point for Veress needle insertion for pneumoperitoneum in difficult laparoscopy."", 'Laparoscopic entry: a review of techniques, technologies, and complications.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

A major mechanism contributing to CRPC progression is through the direct phosphorylation and activation of AR by Src-family (SFK) and ACK1 tyrosine kinases. However, the AR-dependent transcriptional networks activated by Src during CRPC progression have not been elucidated. Here, we show that activated Src (Src527F) induces androgen-independent growth in human LNCaP cells, concomitant with its ability to induce proliferation/survival genes normally induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in androgen-dependent LNCaP and VCaP cells. Src induces additional gene signatures unique to CRPC cell lines, LNCaP-C4-2 and CWR22Rv1, and to CRPC LuCaP35.1 xenografts. By comparing the Src-induced AR-cistrome and/or transcriptome in LNCaP to those in CRPC and LuCaP35.1 tumors, we identified an 11-gene Src-regulated CRPC signature consisting of AR-dependent, AR binding site (ARBS)-associated genes whose expression is altered by DHT in LNCaP[Src527F] but not in LNCaP cells. The differential expression of a subset (DPP4, BCAT1, CNTNAP4, CDH3) correlates with earlier PC metastasis onset and poorer survival, with the expression of BCAT1 required for Src-induced androgen-independent proliferation. Lastly, Src enhances AR binding to non-canonical ARBS enriched for FOXO1, TOP2B and ZNF217 binding motifs; cooperative AR/TOP2B binding to a non-canonical ARBS was both Src- and DHT-sensitive and correlated with increased levels of Src-induced phosphotyrosyl-TOP2B. These data suggest that CRPC progression is facilitated via Src-induced sensitization of AR to intracrine androgen levels, resulting in the engagement of canonical and non-canonical ARBS-dependent gene signatures.""","""['Indranil Chattopadhyay', 'Jianmin Wang', 'Maochun Qin', 'Lingqiu Gao', 'Renae Holtz', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Robert W Leach', 'Irwin H Gelman']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'BAY-069, a Novel (Trifluoromethyl)pyrimidinedione-Based BCAT1/2 Inhibitor and Chemical Probe.', 'Whole-exome sequencing reveals a comprehensive germline mutation landscape and identifies twelve novel predisposition genes in Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'Molecular Regulation of Androgen Receptors in Major Female Reproductive System Cancers.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.']"""

TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is one of the most common chromosomic rearrangements in PCa. However, its implication in bone metastasis development is still unclear. Since bone metastasis starts with the tropism of cancer cells to bone through specific migratory and invasive processes involving osteomimetic capabilities, it is crucial to better our understanding of the influence of TMPRSS2-ERG expression in the mechanisms underlying the bone tropism properties of PCa cells. We developed bioluminescent cell lines expressing the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in order to assess its role in tumor growth and bone metastasis appearance in a mouse model. First, we showed that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion increases cell migration and subcutaneous tumor size. Second, using intracardiac injection experiments in mice, we showed that the expression of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion increases the number of metastases in bone. Moreover, TMPRSS2-ERG affects the pattern of metastatic spread by increasing the incidence of tumors in hind limbs and spine, which are two of the most frequent sites of human PCa metastases. Finally, transcriptome analysis highlighted a series of genes regulated by the fusion and involved in the metastatic process. Altogether, our work indicates that TMPRSS2-ERG increases bone tropism of PCa cells and metastasis development.""","""['Rachel Deplus', 'Carine Delliaux', 'Nathalie Marchand', 'Anne Flourens', 'Nathalie Vanpouille', 'Xavier Leroy', 'Yvan de Launoit', 'Martine Duterque-Coquillaud']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion expression regulates bone markers and enhances the osteoblastic phenotype of prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Identification of novel TMPRSS2:ERG mechanisms in prostate cancer metastasis: involvement of MMP9 and PLXNA2.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Promotes Recruitment of Regulatory T cells and Tumor Growth in Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Unravelling the Role of P300 and TMPRSS2 in Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Profile of chimeric RNAs and TMPRSS2-ERG e2e4 isoform in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Chromosome compartmentalization alterations in prostate cancer cell lines model disease progression.', 'In silico analysis identifies neuropilin-1 as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-Cov-2 infected lung cancer patients.', 'Androgen-Driven Fusion Genes and Chimeric Transcripts in Prostate Cancer.']"""

While there is a growing body of literature on the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients during the early years past diagnosis, less is known regarding QoL in long-term survivors (LTS) (5 + years past diagnosis) and particularly in very long-term survivors (VLTS) (10 + years past diagnosis). The objective of our study is to: (1) compare QoL of long-term cancer survivors and population norms; and (2) assess whether any deficits in QoL of survivors observed 5-10 years past diagnosis persist beyond the 10th year past diagnosis.  Methods:   In total 6952 long-term cancer survivors (5-16 years past diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer) from Germany recruited in the context of the population-based CAESAR + study were compared with 1878 population-based controls without a history of cancer. QoL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Differences in QoL between survivors and controls were assessed via multiple regression while controlling for age, gender, education, and case mix for survivors 5-9 years and 10 + years past diagnosis separately.  Results:   Overall QoL in long-term cancer survivors was comparable to population norms but specific deficits in social, role, emotional, cognitive, and physical functioning and symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties were more prevalent in LTSs. Detriments in QoL persisted during the observation period and affected particularly cancer survivors at younger ages (<50 years). Non-significant aggravations in QoL with longer time since diagnosis were observed in very young and very old cancer survivors.  Conclusions:   Detriments in health-related quality of life persist over more than a decade and affect predominantly younger patients.

Methods:   41 males with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy (Cohort 1) or radical radiotherapy (Cohort 2), who had pre-treatment mpMRI [T2 weighted (T2W) MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI], were studied retrospectively. Dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIPLs) were manually delineated on each sequence and volumes were compared between observers (n = 40 analyzable) and with radical prostatectomy (n = 20). Volume ratios of DW-MRI and DCE-MRI to T2W MRI were documented and compared between Gleason grade 3 + 3, 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 or greater categories.  Results:   Limits of agreement of DIPL volumes between observers were: T2W MRI 0.9, -1.1 cm3, DW-MRI 1.3, -1.7 cm3 and DCE-MRI 0.74, -0.89 cm3. In Cohort 1, T2W volumes overestimated fixed specimen histological volumes (+33% Observer 1, +16% Observer 2); DW- and DCE-MRI underestimated histological volume, the latter markedly so (-32% Observer 1, -79% Observer 2). Differences between T2W, DW- and DCE-MRI volumes were significant (p < 10-8). The ratio of DW-MRI volume (73.9 Â± 18.1% Observer 1, 72.5 Â± 21.9% Observer 2) and DCE-MRI volume (42.6 Â± 24.6% Observer 1, 34.3 Â± 24.9% Observer 2) to T2W volume was significantly different (p < 10-8), but these volume ratios did not differ between the Gleason grades.  Conclusion:   The low variability of the DIPL volume on T2W MRI between Observers and agreement with histology indicates its suitability for delineation of gross tumour volume for radiotherapy planning. The volume of cellular tumour represented by DW-MRI is greater than the vascular (DCE) abnormality; ratios of both to T2W volume are independent of Gleason score. Advances in knowledge: (1) Manual volume measurement of tumour is reproducible within 1 cm3 between observers on all sequences, confirming suitability across observers for radiotherapy planning. (2) Volumes derived on T2W MRI most accurately represent in vivo lesion volumes. (3) The proportion of cellular (DW-MRI) or vascular (DCE-MRI) volume to morphological (T2W MRI) volume is not affected by Gleason score.""","""['Hugh Harvey', 'Matthew R Orton', 'Veronica A Morgan', 'Chris Parker', 'David Dearnaley', 'Cyril Fisher', 'Nandita M deSouza']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['3 Tesla multiparametric MRI for GTV-definition of Dominant Intraprostatic Lesions in patients with Prostate Cancer--an interobserver variability study.', 'Rectal tumour volume (GTV) delineation using T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI: Implications for radiotherapy planning.', 'A Multireader Exploratory Evaluation of Individual Pulse Sequence Cancer Detection on Prostate Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Patient preparation for prostate MRI: A scoping review.', ""Putamen Atrophy Is a Possible Clinical Evaluation Index for Parkinson's Disease Using Human Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging."", 'Combining prostate health index and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in estimating the histological diameter of prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of outcomes after non-contour-based dose painting of dominant intra-epithelial lesion in intra-operative low-dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Prognostic Value of Pretreatment MRI in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'MRI-guided localization of the dominant intraprostatic lesion and dose analysis of volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for prostate cancer.']"""

Patterns of presentation, overall survival (OS), and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) were determined for each race. E3805 clinical trial data also were retrospectively reviewed to assess outcomes of ADT and ADT plus docetaxel by race.  Results:   Of all PCa diagnoses in SEER, distant, de novo, metastatic disease was diagnosed in 4.2% of non-Hispanic whites, 5.8% of Hispanic whites, 5.7% of blacks, 5.5% of Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 8.8% of American Indians/Alaska Natives (P < .001; chi-square test). The median OS differed by race, with superior OS observed among Asian men (30 months) than among men of other races (range, 24-25 months; P < .001).

We previously introduced a device capable of the concurrent detection of cellular and molecular markers from a single sample fluid. Here, an improved design, which achieves affinity as well as size-based separation of captured targets using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads and a silicon chip containing micro-apertures, is presented. Upon injection of the sample, the integration of magnetic attraction with the micro-aperture chip permits larger cell-bead complexes to be isolated in an upper chamber with the smaller protein-bead complexes and remaining beads passing through the micro-apertures into the lower chamber. This enhances captured cell purity for on chip quantification, allows the separate retrieval of captured cells and proteins for downstream analysis, and enables higher bead concentrations for improved multiplexed ligand targeting. Using LNCaP cells and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to model prostate cancer, the device was able to detect 34 pM of spiked PSMA and achieve a cell capture efficiency of 93% from culture media. LNCaP cells and PSMA were then spiked into diluted healthy human blood to mimic a cancer patient.

Design:   Within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), we identified patients with BE diagnosed during 1995-2012. KPNC cancer registry and mortality files were used to estimate standardised incidence ratios (SIR), standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and excess absolute risks.  Results:   There were 8929 patients with BE providing 50 147 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the greater KPNC population, patients with BE had increased risks of any cancer (SIR=1.40, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.49), which slightly decreased after excluding oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk was increased 24 times, which translated into an excess absolute risk of 24 cases per 10 000 person-years. Although oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk decreased with time since BE diagnosis, oesophageal cancer mortality did not, indicating that the true risk is stable and persistent with time. Relative risks of cardia and stomach cancers were increased, but excess absolute risks were modest. Risks of colorectal, lung and prostate cancers were unaltered.

The aim of our retrospective study was to document the incidence, the type of malignancies, the patient/graft survival in the group of kidney transplant recipients in Slovak Republic, and to identify the factors which influenced the outcome. We analyzed the data of 1421 patients who underwent renal transplantation from deceased or living donors in the period from 2007 to 2015 in the Slovak transplant centers. The incidence of malignant tumors was 6%, the malignancy was diagnosed in 85 patients at the age of 54.1 Â± 9.8 years, more frequently in men (68.2 %; P < 0.0001). The mean time of malignancy occurrence was 45 months after transplantation. The most frequent malignancies were skin cancers- basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in 17.6%, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 8.2%, and malignant melanoma (MM) in 2.4% of patients, followed by non-skin tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 16.5%, cancer of colon in 12.9%, prostatic cancer in 9.4%, breast cancer in 9.4%, cancer of lung in 7.1%, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 2.4%, cancer of urine bladder in 2.4%, and cancer of sublingual gland in 1.17% of patients. Surgical treatment was used in 40% of patients, chemotherapy in 7.1%, radiotherapy in 2.4%, treatment with biological agents in 15.3%, combined therapy in 29.4% and palliative treatment in 5.9% of patients. 55.3% of patients underwent conversion from other immunosuppressive agents into mTORi at the time of malignancy occurrence.

We begin with the single fluence map case and then generalize the model and the solution technique to the delivery of sequential fluence maps. The resulting large-scale, non-convex optimization problem was solved using a heuristic approach. We test our method using a prostate case and a head and neck case, and present the resulting trade-off curves. Analysis of the leaf trajectories reveals that short time plans have larger leaf openings in general than longer delivery time plans. Our method allows one to explore the continuum of possibilities between coarse, large segment plans characteristic of direct aperture approaches and narrow field plans produced by sliding window approaches. Exposing this trade-off will allow for an informed choice between plan quality and solution time.

Both AMOTp80 and AMOTp130 are expressed in LNCaP and C4-2B4, but at a low to undetectable level in PC3, DU145, and BPH1 cells. Further study showed that AMOTp130 and AMOTp80 have distinct functions in PCa cells. We found that AMOTp80, but not AMOT p130, functioned as a tumor promoter by enhancing PCa cell proliferation. Mechanistic studies showed that AMOTp80 signaled through the Hippo pathway by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP, resulting in an increased expression of YAP target protein BMP4.

However, the use of postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has not been evaluated in this population. We investigated the prognostic significance of early postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 2,302 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between years 2000 and 2010. Only patients with pre- and postoperative complete blood counts with differential results were included. Patients who received neoadjuvant or postoperative adjuvant treatment and those without adequate medical records were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to analyze biochemical recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used for each endpoint.  Results:   Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (>3.5) was significantly associated with decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival (p = 0.009) and overall survival (p = 0.010). In the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, high postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 1.270, p = 0.008) and overall survival (hazard ratio 1.437, p = 0.033).  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that postoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent factor for biochemical recurrence and overall survival in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

Here, by genome-wide DNA methylome profiling, we sought to identify new biomarkers to improve the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  Experimental design:   Eight novel candidate markers, COL4A6, CYBA, TCAF1 (FAM115A), HLF, LINC01341 (LOC149134), LRRC4, PROM1, and RHCG, were selected from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip analysis of 21 tumor (T) and 21 non-malignant (NM) prostate specimens. Diagnostic potential was further investigated by methylation-specific qPCR analysis of 80 NM vs. 228 T tissue samples. Prognostic potential was assessed by Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis in 203 Danish radical prostatectomy (RP) patients (cohort 1), and validated in an independent cohort of 286 RP patients from Switzerland and the U.S. (cohort 2).  Results:   Hypermethylation of the 8 candidates was highly cancer-specific (area under the curves: 0.79-1.00).

For the present study, cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. The rankings and total expenditures on health of various countries were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The association between variables was analyzed by linear regression analyses. In this study, we estimated the role of MIRs from 35 countries that had a prostate cancer incidence greater than 5,000 cases per year. As expected, high prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates were observed in more developed regions, such as Europe and the Americas.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the level of education in this context. The study sample consisted of 2630 patients with complete data on level of education (college, university degree, master craftsmen, comparable profession, or others), histopathological tumor stage (organ confined or extracapsular), lymph node status (negative or positive), and prostatectomy specimen Gleason score (<7, 7, or 8-10) who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2007. Overall, prostate cancer-specific, competing, and second cancer-related mortalities were study endpoints. Cox proportional hazard models for competing risks were used to study combined effects of the variables on these endpoints. A higher level of education was independently associated with decreased overall mortality after radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.62-0.91, P = 0.0037). The mortality difference was attributable to decreased second cancer mortality (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40-0.85, P = 0.0052) and noncancer mortality (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.98, P = 0.0345) but not to differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.79-1.69, P = 0.4536 in the full model). In conclusion, the level of education might serve as an independent prognostic parameter supplementary to age, comorbidity, and smoking status to estimate the risk of competing mortality and to choose optimal treatment for men with early prostate cancer who are candidates for radical prostatectomy.""","""['Michael Froehner', 'Rainer Koch', 'Stefan Propping', 'Dorothea Liebeheim', 'Matthias HÃ¼bler', 'Gustavo B Baretton', 'Oliver W Hakenberg', 'Manfred P Wirth']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index is a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a Bayesian model averaging approach.', 'The presence of extracapsular extension is associated with an increased risk of death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy for patients with seminal vesicle invasion and negative lymph nodes.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Predicting Competing Mortality in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy Aged 70 yr or Older.', 'How education level affects postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up: a single-center experience.', 'Radical prostatectomy in patients aged 75 years or older: review of the literature.']"""

Previously, we found dualistic miR-204 effects, acting either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncomiR in ERG fusion-dependent manner. Here, we provided further evidence for an important role of miR-204 for TMPRSS2/ERG and androgen receptor (AR) signaling modulation and fine tuning that prevents TMPRSS2/ERG overexpression in prostate cancer. Based on proximity-based ligation assay, we designed a novel method for detection of TMPRSS2/ERG protein products. We found that miR-204 is TMPRSS2/ERG oncofusion negative regulator, and this was mediated by DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 promoter. Transcriptional factors runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) were positive regulators of TMPRSS2/ERG expression and promoter hypo-methylation. Clustering of patients' sera for fusion protein, transcript expression, and wild-type ERG transcript isoforms, demonstrated not all patients harboring fusion transcripts had fusion protein products, and only few fusion positive ones exhibited increased wild-type ERG transcripts. miR-204 upregulated AR through direct promoter hypo-methylation, potentiated by the presence of ERG fusion and RUNX2 and ETS1. Proteomics studies provided evidence that miR-204 has dualistic role in AR cancer-related reprogramming, promoting prostate cancer-related androgen-responsive genes and AR target genes, as well as AR co-regulatory molecules. miR-204 methylation regulation was supported by changes in molecules responsible for chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and its regulation. In summary, miR-204 is a mild regulator of the AR function during the phase of preserved AR sensitivity as the latter one is required for ERG-fusion translocation.""","""['Krassimira Todorova', 'Metodi V Metodiev', 'Gergana Metodieva', 'Milcho Mincheff', 'Nelson FernÃ¡ndez', 'Soren Hayrabedyan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['miR-204 is dysregulated in metastatic prostate cancer in vitro.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'ERG signaling in prostate cancer is driven through PRMT5-dependent methylation of the Androgen Receptor.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Covid-19 pathogenesis in prostatic cancer and TMPRSS2-ERG regulatory genetic pathway.', 'Mutator-Derived lncRNA Landscape: A Novel Insight Into the Genomic Instability of Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Alternative RNA Splicing-The Trojan Horse of Cancer Cells in Chemotherapy.', 'In Silico Identification of miRNA-lncRNA Interactions in Male Reproductive Disorder Associated with COVID-19 Infection.', 'A health disparities study of MicroRNA-146a expression in prostate cancer samples derived from African American and European American patients.']"""

Tumor-host interactions are critical for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells; accordingly, we hypothesize that specific targeting of the tumor microenvironment may constitute an alternative or additional strategy to conventional tumor-directed chemotherapy. Because adipocytes have been shown to promote breast and prostate cancer proliferation, and because the bone marrow adipose tissue accounts for up to 70% of bone marrow volume in adult humans, we examined the adipocyte-leukemia cell interactions to determine if they are essential for the growth and survival of AML. Using in vivo and in vitro models of AML, we show that bone marrow adipocytes from the tumor microenvironment support the survival and proliferation of malignant cells from patients with AML. We show that AML blasts alter metabolic processes in adipocytes to induce phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and consequently activate lipolysis, which then enables the transfer of fatty acids from adipocytes to AML blasts. In addition, we report that fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) messenger RNA is upregulated in adipocytes and AML when in coculture. FABP4 inhibition using FABP4 short hairpin RNA knockdown or a small molecule inhibitor prevents AML proliferation on adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of FABP4 increases survival in Hoxa9/Meis1-driven AML model. Finally, knockdown of carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA in an AML patient-derived xenograft model improves survival.

Results:   Nineteen thousand five hundred thirty eight patients were analyzed. Age and median follow-up differed significantly with radiotherapy only patients having the highest median age (70.3 years) and radical prostatectomy only patients the longest median follow-up (10.2 years).

Preliminary evidence suggests natural therapies such as nutrition therapy and structured exercise prescription can reduce symptoms of cancer-related fatigue. Men appear to change their habitual dietary patterns after prostate cancer diagnosis, yet prostate-specific dietary guidelines provide limited support for managing adverse side effects of treatment. The exercise literature has shown high intensity interval training can improve various aspects of health that are typically impaired with androgen deprivation therapy; however exercise at this intensity is yet to be conducted in men with prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of nutrition therapy beyond the current healthy eating guidelines with high intensity interval training for managing cancer-related fatigue in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods/design:   This is a two-arm randomized control trial of 116 men with prostate cancer and survivors treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group i.e. nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training, or usual care. The intervention group will receive 20 weeks of individualized nutrition therapy from an Accredited Practising Dietitian, and high intensity interval training (from weeks 12-20 of the intervention) from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. The usual care group will maintain their standard treatment regimen over the 20 weeks. Both groups will undertake primary and secondary outcome testing at baseline, week 8, 12, and 20; testing includes questionnaires of fatigue and quality of life, objective measures of body composition, muscular strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, biomarkers for disease progression, as well as dietary analysis. The primary outcomes for this trial are measures of fatigue and quality of life.  Discussion:   This study is the first of its kind to determine the efficacy of nutrition therapy above the healthy eating guidelines and high intensity interval training for alleviating prostate-cancer related fatigue. If successful, nutrition therapy and high intensity interval training may be proposed as an effective therapy for managing cancer-related fatigue and improving quality of life in men during and after prostate cancer treatment.

The assay was validated in solitary cells of GM14667, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, achieving a DNA amplification efficiency of 70% with methylation patterns identical to the respective bulk DNA. Then we applied multiplexed-scAEBS to 159 single CTCs from 11 patients with metastatic breast and six with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, isolated via CellSearch (EpCAMpos/CKpos/CD45neg/DAPIpos) and subsequent FACS sorting. In contrast to CD45pos white blood cells isolated and processed by the identical approach, we observed in the isolated CTCs methylation patterns resembling more those of epithelial-like cells. Methylation at the promoter of microRNA-200 family was significantly higher in prostate CTCs. Data from our single-cell analysis revealed an epigenetic heterogeneity among CTCs and indicates tumor-specific active epigenetic regulation of EMT-associated genes during blood-borne dissemination.""","""['C F Pixberg', 'K Raba', 'F MÃ¼ller', 'B Behrens', 'E Honisch', 'D Niederacher', 'H Neubauer', 'T Fehm', 'W Goering', 'W A Schulz', 'P Flohr', 'G Boysen', 'M Lambros', 'J S De Bono', 'W T Knoefel', 'C Sproll', 'N H Stoecklein', 'R P L Neves']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Gene expression profiling of single circulating tumor cells in\xa0ovarian cancer - Establishment of a multi-marker gene panel.', 'Co-expression of putative stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers on single circulating tumour cells from patients with early and metastatic breast cancer.', 'EpCAM-Independent Enrichment of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Expression of stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in circulating tumor cells of breast cancer patients.', 'Epigenetics of Circulating Tumor Cells in Breast Cancer.', 'Epigenetic markers and therapeutic targets for metastasis.', 'Technologies and applications of single-cell DNA methylation sequencing.', 'Single-Cell DNA Methylation Analysis in Cancer.', 'Clinical Relevancy of Circulating Tumor Cells in Breast Cancer: Epithelial or Mesenchymal Characteristics, Single Cells or Clusters?', 'CDH1 (E-cadherin) Gene Methylation in Human Breast Cancer: Critical Appraisal of a Long and Twisted Story.']"""

Methods and materials:   The bladder dose-surface maps of 754 participants from the TROG 03.04-RADAR trial were generated from the volumetric data by virtually cutting the bladder at the sagittal slice, intersecting the bladder center-of-mass through to the bladder posterior and projecting the dose information on a 2-dimensional plane. Pixelwise dose comparisons were performed between patients with and without symptoms (dysuria, hematuria, incontinence, and an International Prostate Symptom Score increase of â¥10 [ÎIPSS10]). The results with and without permutation-based multiple-comparison adjustments are reported. The pixelwise multivariate analysis findings (peak-event model for dysuria, hematuria, and ÎIPSS10; event-count model for incontinence), with adjustments for clinical factors, are also reported.  Results:   The associations of the spatially specific dose measures to urinary dysfunction were dependent on the presence of specific symptoms. The doses received by the anteroinferior and, to lesser extent, posterosuperior surface of the bladder had the strongest relationship with the incidence of dysuria, hematuria, and ÎIPSS10, both with and without adjustment for clinical factors. For the doses to the posteroinferior region corresponding to the area of the trigone, the only symptom with significance was incontinence.  Conclusions:   A spatially variable response of the bladder surface to the dose was found for symptoms of urinary dysfunction. Limiting the dose extending anteriorly might help reduce the risk of urinary dysfunction.""","""['Noorazrul Yahya', 'Martin A Ebert', 'Michael J House', 'Angel Kennedy', 'John Matthews', 'David J Joseph', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Urinary symptoms following external beam radiotherapy of the prostate: Dose-symptom correlates with multiple-event and event-count models.', 'Voxel-Based Analysis for Identification of Urethrovesical Subregions Predicting Urinary Toxicity After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Predictors for chronic urinary toxicity after the treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy: dose-volume analysis of a phase II dose-escalation study.', 'Development of a prediction model for late urinary incontinence, hematuria, pain and voiding frequency among irradiated prostate cancer patients.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Predictors for late genitourinary toxicity in men receiving radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer using planned and accumulated dose.', 'Incidence of genitourinary complications following radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of planned versus accumulated dose as a predictor for late gastrointestinal toxicity in men receiving radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Bladder surface dose modeling in prostate cancer radiotherapy: An analysis of motion-induced variations and the cumulative dose across the treatment.', 'Radiation Pneumonitis in Thoracic Cancer Patients: Multi-Center Voxel-Based Analysis.']"""

Methods and materials:   Radioisotope-guided SLND was performed in 224 clinically node-negative patients scheduled to undergo external beam radiation therapy. Patients with histologically positive SLNs (pN1) were also offered radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes, combined with 3 years of ADT. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), overall survival, and metastasis-free (including pelvic and nonregional lymph nodes) survival (MFS) rates were retrospectively calculated. The Briganti and Kattan nomogram predictions were compared with the observed pN status and BCR.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 15.4 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 8-29). A total number of 834 SLNs (median 3 per patient; IQR 2-5) were removed. Nodal metastases were diagnosed in 42% of the patients, with 150 SLNs affected (median 1; IQR 1-2). The 5-year BCR-free and MFS rates for pN0 patients were 67.9% and 87.8%, respectively. The corresponding values for pN1 patients were 43% and 66.6%. The PSA level and number of removed SLNs were independent predictors of BCR and MFS, and pN status was an additional independent predictor of BCR. The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.6% and correlated only with pN status. The predictive accuracy of the Briganti nomogram was 0.665. Patients in the higher quartiles of Kattan nomogram prediction of BCR had better than expected outcomes. The complication rate from SLND was 8.9%.  Conclusions:   For radioisotope-guided SLND, the high staging accuracy is accompanied by low morbidity. The better than expected outcomes observed in the lower quartiles of BCR prediction suggest a role for SLN biopsy as a potential selection tool for the addition of pelvic radiation therapy and ADT intensification in pN1 patients.""","""['Nikolaos Grivas', 'Esther Wit', 'Floris Pos', 'Jeroen de Jong', 'Erik Vegt', 'Axel Bex', 'Kees Hendricksen', 'Simon Horenblas', 'Gijs KleinJan', 'Bas van Rhijn', 'Henk van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Nodal Clearance Rate and Long-Term Efficacy of\xa0Individualized Sentinel Node-Based Pelvic Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Validation and head-to-head comparison of three nomograms predicting probability of lymph node invasion of prostate cancer in patients undergoing extended and/or sentinel lymph node dissection.', 'Seminal vesicle biopsy and laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection: implications for patient selection in the radiotherapeutic management of prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer: definition, prognosis and treatment.', 'Sentinel Node Procedure to Select Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with Occult Nodal Metastases for Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy.', 'Influence of lymph node degeneration on metastases in prostate cancer: or why we must look for a needle in a haystack.', 'Current Imaging Techniques for Lymph Node Staging in Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'Dramatic polarization in genitourinary expert opinions regarding the clinical utility of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Sentinel lymph node imaging in urologic oncology.']"""

Understanding survivors' preferences for follow-up care is elementary for designing patient-centred care. Based on data from prostate cancer and melanoma survivors, this study aims to identify: 1) preferences for follow-up care providers, for instance the medical specialist, the oncology nurse or the general practitioner; 2) characteristics associated with these preferences and 3) the preferred care provider to discuss cancer-related problems.  Material and methods:   Survivors diagnosed with prostate cancer (N = 535) and melanoma (N = 232) between 2007 and 2013 as registered in The Netherlands Cancer Registry returned a questionnaire (response rate was 71% and 69%, respectively). A latent class cluster model analysis was used to define preferences and a multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify survivor-related characteristics associated with these preferences.  Results:   Of all survivors, 29% reported no preference, 40% reported a preference for the medical specialist, 20% reported a preference for both the medical specialist and the general practitioner and 11% reported a preference for both the medical specialist and the oncology nurse. Survivors who were older, lower/intermediate educated and women were more likely to have a preference for the medical specialist. Lower educated survivors were less likely to have a preference for both the medical specialist and the general practitioner. Overall, survivors prefer to discuss diet, physical fitness and fatigue with the general practitioner, and hereditary and recurrence with the medical specialist. Only a small minority favored to discuss cancer-related problems with the oncology nurse.  Conclusion:   Survivors reported different preferences for follow-up care providers based on age, education level, gender and satisfaction with the general practitioner, showing a need for tailored follow-up care in oncology.

We retrospectively investigated the prognostic role of pretreatment NLR in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated with first-line docetaxel.  Methods:   All CRPC patients treated with first-line docetaxel at two Italian institutions, with available data about baseline neutrophil and lymphocyte values, were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients were divided in two groups according to NLR ratio (low NLR: â¤3; high NLR: >3). Outcome measures were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), measured from the start of docetaxel treatment. Univariate and multivariate analysis (adjusting for baseline prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, albumin, performance status, use of opioids and presence of visceral disease) were performed.  Results:   One hundred and seventy-nine patients treated between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed and 110 had information about pretreatment NLR. Forty-six patients (42%) had low NLR and 64 (58%) had high NLR. Median PFS was 8.8 months in patients with low NLR versus 7.3 months in those with high NLR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.69, p = .58]. Median OS was 34.9 months in patients with low NLR versus 20.2 months in those with high NLR (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.19, p = .02). At multivariate analysis, NLR confirmed an independent impact on OS (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.50-6.65, p = .002).

We show that BRCA2-mutant PCa harbour increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastastic than localized disease. BRCA2-mutant PCa shows genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the MED12L/MED12 axis, which is frequently dysregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This dysregulation is enriched in BRCA2-mutant PCa harbouring intraductal carcinoma (IDC). Microdissection and sequencing of IDC and juxtaposed adjacent non-IDC invasive carcinoma in 10 patients demonstrates a common ancestor to both histopathologies.

The study of cancer cells in culture plays an important role in understanding mechanisms leading to altered choline (Cho) and lipid metabolism in cancer, as it provides a carefully controlled environment. However, a solid tumor is a complex system with a unique tumor microenvironment frequently containing hypoxic and acidic regions and areas of nutrient deprivation and necrosis. Cancer cell-stromal cell interactions and the extracellular matrix may also alter Cho and lipid metabolism.

Methods:   Partners of men with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic prostate cancer were randomized to SET (n = 45) or usual care (n = 32). SET involved six weekly group sessions emphasizing emotional expression, social support, and finding meaning in the cancer experience. Measures of mood disturbance, marital satisfaction, and social support were administered to both partners and patients at baseline, post-program, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.  Results:   There were no significant differences between SET and the control group for either patients or their wives on any outcome. Regardless of group membership, partners reported improvements in total mood disturbance (p = .011), tension (p < .001), anger (p = .041), confusion (p < .001), state anxiety (p = .001), and emotional support (p = .037), and patients reported improvements in tension (p = .003), emotional support (p = .047), positive interaction support (p = .004), and overall social support (p = .026).  Conclusions:   Compared to the natural course of recovery, SET did not improve psychosocial outcomes for either men with prostate cancer or their wives.

Patients and methods:   This study included 108 consecutive patients with mCRPC who sequentially received abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (Enz), in either order, without prior treatment with docetaxel. The combined prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the sum of PFS1 and PFS2, representing PSA PFSs on the first and second ARAT agents, respectively.  Results:   Of these patients, 49 and 59 received ARAT therapy with the AA-to-Enz sequence (AA-to-Enz group) and with the reverse sequence (Enz-to-AA group), respectively. No significant differences in the baseline characteristics were noted between the 2 groups. In the overall patient population, the PSA response rate to the second-line ARAT agent (21.3%) was significantly lower than that of the first-line ARAT agent (58.3%). The combined PSA PFS in the AA-to-Enz group (median, 18.4 months) was significantly superior to that of the Enz-to-AA group (median, 12.8 months). Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified the treatment sequence (ie, AA-to-Enz vs. Enz-to-AA group) in addition to performance status as an independent predictor of combined PSA PFS in these patients. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups.  Conclusions:   Although cross-resistance between ARAT agents is a common phenomenon in docetaxel-naÃ¯ve patients with mCRPC, different efficacies were observed favoring the AA-to-Enz rather than Enz-to-AA sequence in this series with respect to combined PSA PFS but not OS.""","""['Hideaki Miyake', 'Takuto Hara', 'Keita Tamura', 'Takayuki Sugiyama', 'Hiroshi Furuse', 'Seiichiro Ozono', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Impact of prior androgen receptor-axis-targeted agents on the clinical activity of subsequent docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: comparative assessment between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'Comparison of Alternative Androgen Receptor-axis-targeted Agent (ARATA) and Docetaxel as Second-line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With Progression After Initial ARATA in Real-world Clinical Practice in Japan.', 'Independent association between time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and PSA progression-free survival in patients with docetaxel-naÃ¯ve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving abiraterone acetate, but not enzalutamide.', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Systematic Review of Efficacy and Health Economic Implications of Real-world Treatment Sequencing in Prostate Cancer: Where Do the Newer Agents Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Fit in?', 'Efficacy and safety of apalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (GENESIS): protocol for a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical trial.', 'Plasma progastrin-releasing peptide level shows different predictive profiles for treatment response by androgen receptor axis-targeted agents in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Correlation of Progression-Free Survival-2 and Overall Survival in Solid Tumors.', 'Corticosteroids alleviate adverse events associated with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Oncologic Outcomes Between Two Alternative Sequences with Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Objective:   To identify the location of sPCa lesions being missed with MR- and TRUS-Bx.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a referral center, 223 consecutive Bx-naive men with elevated prostate specific antigen level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination were included. Histopathologically-proven cancer locations, Gleason score, and tumor length were determined.  Intervention:   All patients underwent multi-parametric MRI and 12-core systematic TRUS-Bx. MR-Bx was performed in all patients with suspicion of PCa on multi-parametric MRI (n=142).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer locations were compared between MR- and TRUS-Bx. Proportions were expressed as percentages, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.  Results and limitations:   In total, 191 lesions were found in 108 patients with sPCa. From these lesion 74% (141/191) were defined as sPCa on either MR- or TRUS-Bx. MR-Bx detected 74% (105/141) of these lesions and 61% (86/141) with TRUS-Bx. TRUS-Bx detected more lesions compared with MR-Bx (140 vs 109). However, these lesions were often low risk (39%). Significant lesions missed with MR-Bx most often had involvement of dorsolateral (58%) and apical (37%) segments and missed segments with TRUS-Bx were located anteriorly (79%), anterior midprostate (50%), and anterior apex (23%).  Conclusions:   Both techniques have difficulties in detecting apical lesions. MR-Bx most often missed cancer with involvement of the dorsolateral part (58%) and TRUS-Bx with involvement of the anterior part (79%).  Patient summary:   Both biopsy techniques miss cancer in specific locations within the prostate.

Methods The study involved a cross-sectional study design with data collected from 11 rural South Australian (SA) men's sheds. The survey collected information across 5 domains: demographics; health history, status, concerns and interests; health knowledge; help-seeking behaviours and health information format preferences. Results Data from 154 shed members were available for analysis. Rural SA sheds primarily cater for older, retired, lesser educated men from lower socioeconomic strata. The key health issues were age-related chronic conditions yet self-reported health status remained high. The GP was the preferred source of health advice. Key knowledge deficits were in the areas of reproductive and psychological health. The preferred mode for health education was hands-on or kinaesthetic approaches as opposed to seminars or internet based information. Conclusions Priority topics for health promotion programs should include prostate disorders, reproductive and sexual health issues, psychological health, risk factors for common chronic disease and bowel cancer. Programs should incorporate hands-on education approaches. Shed and shed member diversity should be considered when designing programs. So what?

Our automated non-invasive system for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer segments the prostate on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI) acquired at different b-values, estimates its apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), and classifies their descriptors - empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) - with a trained deep learning network. To segment the prostate, an evolving geometric (level-set-based) deformable model is guided by a speed function depending on intensity attributes extracted from the DW-MRI with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). For a more robust evolution, the attributes are fused with a probabilistic shape prior and estimated spatial dependencies between prostate voxels. To preserve continuity, the ADCs of the segmented prostate volume at different b-values are normalized and refined using a generalized Gauss-Markov random field image model. The CDFs of the refined ADCs at different b-values are considered global water diffusion features and used to distinguish between benign and malignant prostates. A deep learning network of stacked non-negativity-constrained auto-encoders (SNCAE) is trained to classify the benign or malignant prostates on the basis of the constructed CDFs.

The biochemical failure-free survival (bFFS) rate was based on the 'Phoenix' definition (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL). Secondary endpoints included progression to metastasis and cancer-specific death. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed examining overall (OS), cancer-specific (CSS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Adverse events and quality of life status are reported.  Results:   In all, 418 patients with a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.5 (2.5) years were included. The mean (SD) age was 68.6 (5.8) years and the PSA level before S-HIFU was 6.8 (7.8) ng/mL.

CDK9 dephosphorylation mobilizes P-TEFb from an inhibitory 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex, but mechanisms targeting phosphatases to P-TEFb are unclear. We show that AR recruits protein phosphatase 1Î± (PP1Î±), resulting in P-TEFb mobilization and CDK9-mediated AR S81 phosphorylation. This increased pS81 enhances p300 recruitment, histone acetylation, BRD4 binding and subsequent further recruitment of P-TEFb, generating a positive feedback loop that sustains transcription. AR S81 is also phosphorylated by CDK1, and blocking basal CDK1-mediated S81 phosphorylation markedly suppresses AR activity and initiation of this positive feedback loop. Finally, androgen-independent AR activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells is driven by increased CDK1-mediated S81 phosphorylation.

Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), based on country-specific and period-specific incidence rates, were analysed for all cancers combined (except non-melanoma skin), bladder, lung, stomach cancer, leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Exploratory analyses were conducted for other cancers with a minimum of 10 cases in both genders combined.  Results:   16 026 individuals (12 441 men; 3585 women) contributed to 397 975 person-years of observation, with 846 cancers observed overall (437 in the UK, 409 in Sweden). No statistically significant increased risk was observed for any site of cancer. A reduced risk was evident for all cancers combined (SIR=0.83, 95% CI (0.74 to 0.92)), lung cancer (SIR=0.74, 95% CI (0.59 to 0.93)), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR=0.67, 95% CI (0.45 to 1.00)) and prostate cancer (SIR=0.77, 95% CI (0.64 to 0.92)). For stomach cancer and multiple myeloma, SIRs were 0.93 (95% CI (0.61 to 1.43)) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.91), respectively. No increased risk of bladder cancer was observed (SIR=0.88, 95% CI (0.61 to 1.28)).  Conclusions:   No significantly increased risk of cancer incidence was observed in the combined cohort of rubber workers first employed since 1975. Continued surveillance of the present cohorts is required to confirm absence of long-term risk and confirmatory findings from other cohorts would be important.""","""['M Boniol', 'A Koechlin', 'T Sorahan', 'K Jakobsson', 'P Boyle']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Occup Environ Med""","""['Cancer mortality in cohorts of workers in the European rubber manufacturing industry first employed since 1975.', 'Meta-analysis of occupational exposures in the rubber manufacturing industry and risk of cancer.', 'Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'A critical review of cancer epidemiology in the petroleum industry, with a meta-analysis of a combined database of more than 350,000 workers.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality in the Swedish polyurethane foam manufacturing industry.']"""

Summary answer:   JAM-A is present in the prostate and seminal vesicles and in all three regions of the epididymis where it is secreted in epididymosomes in the luminal fluid and can be delivered to sperm in vitro.  What is known already:   JAM-A shares with the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase 4 (PMCA4, the major Ca2+ efflux pump in murine sperm) a common interacting partner, CASK (Ca2+/CaM-dependent serine kinase). JAM-A, like PMCA4, plays a role in Ca2+ regulation, since deletion of Jam-A results in significantly elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels and reduced sperm motility. Recently, PMCA4 was reported to be expressed in the epididymis and along with CASK was shown to be in a complex on epididymosomes where it was transferred to sperm. Because of the association of JAM-A with CASK in sperm and because of the presence of PMCA4 and CASK in the epididymis, the present study was performed to determine whether JAM-A is expressed in the epididymis and delivered to sperm during their maturation.  Study design, size, duration:   The epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles were collected from sexually mature C57BL/6J and Institute for Cancer Research mice and antibodies specific for JAM-A and Ser285 -phosphorylated JAM-A (pJAM-A) were used for the analysis. Tissues, sperm and epididymal luminal fluid (ELF) were studied. Epididymosomes were also isolated for study. Caput and caudal sperm were co-incubated with ELF individually to determine their abilities to acquire JAM-A in vitro.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Sections of all three regions of the epididymis were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Epididymal tissues, fluid, sperm, prostate and seminal vesicle tissues were analyzed for JAM-A and/or pJAM-A via western blotting analysis. The relative amounts of JAM-A and pJAM-A among epididymal tissues, ELF and sperm were detected by western blot via quantification of band intensities. Epididymosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of the ELF after it was clarified to remove cells and tissue fragments, and the proteins western blotted for JAM-A and pJAM-A, and exosomal biochemical markers. FACS analysis was used to quantify the amount of JAM-A present on caput and caudal sperm, as well as the amount of JAM-A acquired in vitro after their co-incubation with ELF.  Main results and the role of chance:   Western blots revealed that JAM-A is expressed in all three regions of the epididymis, the prostate and seminal vesicles. As confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence, a western blot showed that JAM-A has a higher expression in the corpus and caudal regions, where it is significantly (P < 0.01) more abundant than in the caput. Both JAM-A and Ser285-phosphorylated JAM-A (pJAM-A) are secreted into the ELF where it is highest in the distal regions. In the ELF, both JAM-A and pJAM-A were detected in epididymosomes. Western blotting of sperm proteins showed a significant (P < 0.01) increase of JAM-A and pJAM-A in caudal, compared with caput, sperm. Flow-cytometric analysis confirmed the increase in JAM-A in caudal sperm where it was 1.4-fold higher than in caput ones. Co-incubation of caput and caudal sperm with ELF demonstrated ~2.3- and ~1.3-fold increases, respectively, in JAM-A levels indicating that epididymosomes transfer more JAM-A to caput sperm that are less saturated with the protein than caudal ones.  Large scale data:   Not applicable.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   First, although the ELF was clarified prior to ultracentrifugation for epididymosome isolation, we cannot rule out contamination of the epididymosomal proteins by those from epididymal epithelial cells. Second, the JAM-A detected in the prostate and seminal vesicles might not necessarily be secreted from those organs and may only be present within the tissues, where it would be unable to impact sperm in the ejaculate.  Wider implications of the findings:   Although performed in the mouse the study has implications for humans, as the highly conserved JAM-A is a signaling protein in human sperm. There is physiological significance to the finding that JAM-A, which regulates sperm motility and intracellular Ca2+, exists in elevated levels in the cauda where sperm gain motility and fertilizing ability. The study suggests that the acquisition of JAM-A in the epididymal tract is involved in the mechanism by which sperm gain their motility during epididymal maturation. This increased understanding of sperm physiology is important for aspects of ART.

This evaluation aimed to investigate the clinical impact of additional late 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Methods: Between 2011 and 2016, 112 patients with PCa who underwent early (at 1 h after injection) and late (at 3 h after injection) 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were retrospectively evaluated. The late scans were conducted to clarify unclear findings in early scans or to increase the probability of tumor detection in the case of negative early scans. All patients were asked to drink 1 L of water between early and late scans. In addition, 20 patients received 20 mg of furosemide before late scans. Tumor detection and radioactivity concentration within the urinary bladder were analyzed in both scans. The SUVmax and contrast of 149 tumor lesions were measured in 69 patients with pathologic findings. Results: Overall, 134 lesions characteristic for PCa in 57 patients clearly presented at 1 h after injection and 147 lesions in 68 patients at 3 h after injection. Forty-three patients showed no pathologic findings. Eight patients (7.1%) showed 1 unclear finding in early scans, which could be clarified as characteristic for PCa at 3 h after injection. Four patients (3.6%) presented with 1 lesion characteristic for PCa at 3 h after injection only. Twelve patients (10.7%) presented with 12 possible PCa lesions at 1 h after injection, which, however, could not be confirmed as PCa in late scans. Two patients presented with 1 lesion characteristic for PCa at 1 h after injection, which became invisible at 3 h after injection because of low contrast. At 3 h after injection, 62.4% of the lesions demonstrated a higher SUVmax and 65.1% a higher contrast than at 1 h after injection. Patients with furosemide presented with lower SUV and radioactivity concentration within the urinary bladder. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at 3 h after injection showed most lesions characteristic for PCa with a higher uptake and contrast. In addition, the radioactivity signal within the urinary bladder was lower at 3 h after injection, especially when furosemide was applied. Consequently, scans at 3 h after injection detected more tumor lesions than at 1 h after injection.""","""['Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Lars Peter Sattler', 'Walter Mier', 'Boris A Hadaschik', 'JÃ¼rgen Debus', 'Tim Holland-Letz', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Uwe Haberkorn']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Combined Early and Late 68GaPSMA-HBED-CC PET Scans Improve Lesion Detectability in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Low PSA Levels.', 'The Theranostic PSMA Ligand PSMA-617 in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer by PET/CT: Biodistribution in Humans, Radiation Dosimetry, and First Evaluation of Tumor Lesions.', 'Nuclear Medicine Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'Multi-timepoint imaging with PSMA-targeted 18FF-Florastamin PET/CT: lesion detection and comparison to conventional imaging.', 'Stability Estimation of Gallium Complexes of DOTA Derivatives for Radiotheranostic Applications.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Relative risk (RR) was computed based on the conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and MolliÃ© by applying the INLA tool to the cancer data for 2007-2011 for the following tumour locations: colon, rectum and anus (men and women); trachea, bronchia, and lungs, prostate and bladder in men; and breasts in women. The RR was presented in in choropleth and isopleth (with kriging interpolation) risk maps.  Results:   RR for bladder cancer in men was greater than 1.0 in all municipalities, with confidence intervals over 1.0 in four municipalities; Madrid having a 1.56 RR (95%CI 1.30-1.67). For prostate cancer, a posteriori probabilities were below 0.1 in 68 of the 79 municipalities. For lung cancer, nine municipalities had confidence limits below 1.0, almost all of them in western Spain. For women, the RR for breast cancer was significantly higher in the capital of province area. The cancer incidence rates for the Huelva province were, in general, similar to those estimated for Spain, standing out bladder cancer in men (35% higher) and prostate cancer (30% lower).

Methods:   Between 11/2001 and 3/2012, 203 patients with HR disease received CRT to the prostate (78-82 Gy) and pelvic lymph nodes (46-50 Gy) with ADT (6 m-2 years). Median follow-up was 50 months (12 m-142 m). Biochemical failure was defined according to Phoenix definition. Imaging studies were used to identify local, regional or metastatic failure. Four different VHR/HR groupings were formed using the 2014 and revised 2015 NCCN guidelines. Differences were examined using Kaplan Meier (KM) estimates with log rank test and uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis (MVA).  Results:   Failure occurred in 30/203 patients (15%). Median time to failure was 30 m (4 m-76 m). KM estimate of 4 year biochemical disease free survival (b-DFS) for the entire cohort was 87% (95%CI: 82-92%). Four year KM survival estimates for b-DFS, PCSS and OS were comparable for each NCCN subgroup. On univariate analysis, the NCCN subgroups were not predictive of b-DFS at 4 years, however, DMFS was worse for both VHR subgroups (p = .03and .01) respectively. Cox univariate analysis was also significant for: PSA â¥40 ng/ml p = 0.001; clinical stages T2c p = .004, T3b p = .02 and > 4 cores with Gleason score 8-10 p < .03. On MVA, only PSA â¥ 40 ng/ml was predictive for b-DFS or MFS at 4 years (HR: 3.75 and 3.25, p < 0.005).  Conclusion:   Patients with HR and VHR disease treated with CRT and ADT had good outcomes. Stratification into HR and VHR sub-groups provided no predictive value. Only PSA â¥40 ng/ml predicted poor outcomes on MVA. Distant failure was dominant and local recurrence rare, suggesting that improved systemic treatment rather than intensification of local therapy is needed. Patients with high-risk prostate cancer are most often treated with conformal dose escalated radiation therapy with androgen deprivation. Stratification into high versus very high-risk subgroups using 2014 or revised 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria did not impact treatment outcomes. Only Prostate Serum Antigen (PSA) â¥40 ng/ml was predictive of poor prognosis.

However, it remains unclear whether miRNAs remain stable in FFPE tissues stored for long periods of time.  Methods:   Here we report Taqman real-time RT-PCR quantification of miR-21, miR-141, miR-221, and RNU6B small nuclear RNA (snRNA) levels from 92 radical prostatectomy specimens stored for 12-20 years in FFPE blocks. The relative stability of each transcript over time was assessed using general linear models. The correlation between transcript quantities, sample age, and RNA integrity number (RIN) were determined utilizing Spearman rank correlation.  Results:   All transcript levels linearly decreased with sample age, demonstrating a clear loss of miRNA stability and RNU6B snRNA stability over time. The most rapid rates of degradation were observed for RNU6B and miR-21, while miR-141 and miR-221 were more stable. RNA quality was not correlated with sample age or with miR-21, miR-221, or RNU6B snRNA levels. Conversely, miR-141 levels increased with RNA quality.  Conclusions:   MiRNA and snRNA levels gradually decreased over an eight year period in FFPE tissue blocks. Sample age was the most consistent feature associated with miRNA stability. The reference snRNA, RUN6B, was more rapidly degraded when compared to miR-141 and miR-221 miRNAs. Various miRNAs demonstrated differential rates of degradation.

Genes encoding secreted or extracellular proteins with increased expression in CP may serve as potential biomarkers. For their detection and quantification, assays based on monoclonal antibodies are best suited for development in the clinical setting. One approach to obtain antibodies is to use recombinant proteins as immunogen. However, the synthesis of recombinant protein for each identified candidate is time-consuming and expensive. It is also not practical to generate high quality antibodies to all identified candidates individually. Furthermore, non-native forms (e.g., recombinant) of proteins may not always lead to useful antibodies. Our approach was to purify a subset of proteins from CP tissue specimens for use as immunogen.  Methods:   In the present investigation, ten cancer specimens obtained from cases scored Gleason 3+3, 3+4 and 4+3 were digested by collagenase to single cells in serum-free tissue culture media. Cells were pelleted after collagenase digestion, and the cell-free supernatant from each specimen were pooled and used for isolation of proteins in the 10-30 kDa molecular weight range using a combination of sonication, dialysis and Amicon ultrafiltration. Western blotting and mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics were performed to identify the proteins in the selected size fraction.  Results:   The presence of cancer-specific anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) and absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)/KLK3 were confirmed by Western blotting. Proteomics also detected AGR2 among many other proteins, some outside the selected molecular weight range, as well.  Conclusions:   Using this approach, the potentially harmful (to the mouse host) exogenously added collagenase was removed as well as other abundant prostatic proteins like ACPP/PAP and AZGP1 to preclude the generation of antibodies against these species.

We evaluated the patients' ages, follow-up time, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, pre-op and post-op Gleason score values, pathological stage, positive surgical margin rates, and biochemical PSA recurrence rates. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for age, pre-op PSA values, BMI, pre-op and post-op Gleason scores, positive surgical margin rates and biochemical recurrence rates. There was a significant difference between prostate weight, tumor volume, and clinical stage.  Conclusion:   Removing the specimen with traction during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy does not cause a positive surgical margin.

The occurrence of intracellular P. acnes infection in prostate glands and the higher frequency of P. acnes-positive glands in radical prostatectomy specimens from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) than in those from patients without PCa led us to examine whether the P. acnes-positive gland frequency can be used to assess the risk for PCa in patients whose first prostate biopsy, performed due to an increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) titer, was negative.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected the first and last prostate biopsy samples from 44 patients that were diagnosed PCa within 4 years after the first negative biopsy and from 36 control patients with no PCa found in repeated biopsy for at least 3 years after the first biopsy. We evaluated P. acnes-positive gland frequency and P. acnes-positive macrophage number using enzyme-immunohistochemistry with a P. acnes-specific monoclonal antibody (PAL antibody).  Results:   The frequency of P. acnes-positive glands was higher in PCa samples than in control samples in both first biopsy samples and in combined first and last biopsy samples (P < 0.001). A frequency greater than the threshold (18.5 and 17.7, respectively) obtained by each receiver operating characteristic curve was an independent risk factor for PCa (P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively) with odds ratios (14.8 and 13.9, respectively) higher than those of serum PSA titers of patients just before each biopsy (4.6 and 2.3, respectively). The number of P. acnes-positive macrophages did not differ significantly between PCa and control samples.  Conclusions:   These results suggested that the frequency of P. acnes-positive glands in the first negative prostate biopsy performed due to increased PSA titers can be supportive information for urologists in planning repeated biopsy or follow-up strategies.""","""['Tomoya Kakegawa', 'Yuan Bae', 'Takashi Ito', 'Keisuke Uchida', 'Masaki Sekine', 'Yutaka Nakajima', 'Asuka Furukawa', 'Yoshimi Suzuki', 'Jiro Kumagai', 'Takumi Akashi', 'Yoshinobu Eishi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Intracellular Propionibacterium acnes infection in glandular epithelium and stromal macrophages of the prostate with or without cancer.', 'The antibody response to Propionibacterium acnes is an independent predictor of serum prostate-specific antigen levels in biopsy-negative men.', 'Propionibacterium acnes associated with inflammation in radical prostatectomy specimens: a possible link to cancer evolution?', 'Links between Propionibacterium acnes and prostate cancer.', 'Propionibacterium acnes: infection beyond the skin.', 'Potential Association of Cutibacterium acnes with Sarcoidosis as an Endogenous Hypersensitivity Infection.', 'Prostate Infiltration by Treg and Th17 Cells as an Immune Response to Propionibacterium acnes Infection in the Course of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiple pathogens and prostate cancer.', 'Bacteria-Mediated Oncogenesis and the Underlying Molecular Intricacies: What We Know So Far.', 'Dysbiotic microbes and how to find them: a review of microbiome profiling in prostate cancer.']"""

Treatments are usually fractionated and treatment plans are evaluated with the total RBE-weighted dose; however, this is of limited relevance to the biological effect. In this study, we reformulate the biologically effective dose (BED) to normalize the dose-fractionation and cell-repopulation effects as well as the RBE of treating radiation, based on inactivation of a reference cell line by a reference carbon-ion radiation. The BED distribution virtually represents the biological effect of a treatment regardless of radiation modality or fractionation scheme. We applied the BED formulation to simplistic model treatments and to a preclinical survey for hypofractionation based on an actual prostate cancer treatment with carbon ions. The proposed formulation was demonstrated to be practical and to give theoretical implications. For a prostate cancer treatment in 12 fractions, the distributions of BED and of RBE-weighted dose were very similar. With hypofractionation, while the RBE-weighted dose distribution varied significantly, the BED distribution was nearly invariant, implying that carbon-ion radiotherapy would be effectively insensitive to fractionation.

Furthermore, symmetry analysis was applied to the claims database to identify the risk of cancer after using ARBs from January 2005 to July 2013.

Here, we first propose and experimentally validate a software tool to simulate couch and MLC tracking, and then use the simulator to study hybrid couch-MLC tracking for improved tracking performance.  Materials and methods:   The tracking simulator requires a treatment plan and a motion trajectory as input and simulates the delivered monitor units and motion of all accelerator parts as function of time. The simulator outputs accelerator log files synchronized with the target motion as well as the MLC exposure error, which is a simple dose error surrogate. A series of couch and MLC tracking experiments were used to determine appropriate parameters for the simulator dynamics and to validate the simulator by its ability to reproduce the experimental tracking accuracy. Three hybrid couch-MLC tracking strategies were investigated. All strategies divided the target motion in beam's eye view into motion perpendicular and parallel to the MLC leaves. In the hybrid strategies, couch tracking compensated for the following target motion components (in order of decreasing couch tracking contribution): (a) all perpendicular motion, (b) residual perpendicular motion less than half a leaf width, and (c) persistent residual perpendicular motion that was stable at a time scale of 1s. MLC tracking compensated for the remaining target motion. All tracking strategies were simulated with two prostate and two lung cancer single-arc VMAT plans using 695 prostate trajectories and 160 lung tumor trajectories. The tracking error was quantified as the MLC exposure error. The couch motion was quantified as the mean speed, acceleration, and jerk of the couch.  Results:   The simulator reproduced the experimental gantry position with a mean (maximum) root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.07Â°(0.2Â°). The geometrical rms tracking error was reproduced with mean (maximum) absolute errors of 0.20 mm(0.23 mm) and 0.1 mm(0.23 mm) for MLC tracking parallel and perpendicular to the MLC leaves, and 0.40 mm(0.46 mm), 0.09 mm(0.25 mm), and 0.20 mm(0.46 mm) for couch tracking in the left-right, anterior-posterior, and cranio-caudal directions. The MLC exposure error of VMAT MLC tracking was reproduced with a mean absolute error of 5.6%. All hybrid tracking strategies reduced the couch motion relative to pure couch tracking and improved the tracking accuracy compared with pure MLC tracking. The mean MLC exposure error reduction relative to no tracking was 66.6% (couch tracking), 72.9% (hybrid (1)), 70.2% (2), 59.1% (3), and 55.6% (MLC tracking) for lung tumor motion and 76.5% (couch tracking), 76.1% (1), 74.3% (2), 72.3% (3), and 35.9% (MLC tracking) for prostate motion. For prostate motion, pure MLC tracking resulted in rather large MLC exposure errors that were more than halved with all hybrid tracking strategies.  Conclusion:   A couch and MLC tracking simulator was developed and experimentally validated against a series of tracking experiments. All hybrid couch-MLC tracking strategies improved MLC tracking. Two strategies also improved couch tracking of lung tumors. In particular, MLC tracking of prostate may be greatly improved by a modest degree of couch motion.""","""['Jakob Toftegaard', 'Rune Hansen', 'Thomas Ravkilde', 'Kristijan Macek', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Potential improvements of lung and prostate MLC tracking investigated by treatment simulations.', 'Effects of collimator angle, couch angle, and starting phase on motion-tracking dynamic conformal arc therapy (4D DCAT).', 'Intrafractional motion management in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Motion compensation in radiotherapy.', 'Direct measurement and correction of both megavoltage and kilovoltage scattered x-rays for orthogonal kilovoltage imaging subsystems with dual flat panel detectors.', 'Patterns of practice for adaptive and real-time radiation therapy (POP-ART RT) part I: Intra-fraction breathing motion management.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Technical Note: In silico and experimental evaluation of two leaf-fitting algorithms for MLC tracking based on exposure error and plan complexity.', 'Review of Real-Time 3-Dimensional Image Guided Radiation Therapy on Standard-Equipped Cancer Radiation Therapy Systems: Are We at the Tipping Point for the Era of Real-Time Radiation Therapy?']"""

Both qRT-PCR and western blotting indicated that PYCR1 was suppressed efficiently after sh-PYCR1 infection. Further analysis indicated knockdown of PYCR1 significantly inhibited PCa cell growth and colony formation ability. The inhibition effects on growth were likely due to G2/M-phase arrest and enhanced cell apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometer analysis. At last, we verified the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins, including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and Cyclin B1 were all downregulated and cell apoptotic-related proteins, including cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP were increased in PCa cells after PYCR1 knockdown. Furthermore, PYCR1 has been shown not to be directly regulated by androgen receptor (AR) levels.

In the present study, cytotoxic and apoptogenic properties of hydro-ethanol extract of B. multifidi was investigated on human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU 145) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells.  Materials and methods:   Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37ÂºC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The root of the plant was macerated with EtOH 70%. Cytotoxic activity of ethanol extract of B. multifida was assessed using alamarBlueÂ® assay after 48 hr of treatment. Apoptotic cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and detected by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak).  Results: B.multifidi had cytotoxic effect on malignant cells and normal HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner and significantly decreased the cell viability (IC50 values were between 199.2 and 302.9 Âµg/ml). B. multifida increased the sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated PC3 cells compared to control showing the induction of apoptosis and DNA fragmentation.

However, whether Dp44mT has anticancer effects in osteosarcoma is still unknown. Here, we investigated the antitumor action of Dp44mT in osteosarcoma and its underlying mechanisms. A human osteosarcoma 143B cell line in vitro and 143B xenograft in nude mice in vivo were utilized, the anticancer effects of Dp44mT were examined through methods of MTT assay, transwell, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, western blot, immunohistochemistry and H&E staining. We showed that Dp44mT inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. In addition, flow cytometry further illustrated that Dp44mT suppression of 143B cell proliferation, invasion and migration were partially due to induction of cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in S phase and ROS production. Also in vitro and in vivo, the expression levels of Bcl2, Bax, Caspase3, Caspase9, LC3-II, Î²-catenin and its downstream targets such as C-myc and Cyclin D1 demonstrated that cell apoptosis and autophagy, as well as Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway were involved in Dp44mT induced osteosarcoma suppression. The Dp44mT inhibition of osteosarcoma was further verified via animal models. The findings indicated that in vivo Dp44mT showed a significant reduction in the 143B xenograft tumor growth and metastasis. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Dp44mT has effective anticancer capability in osteosarcoma and that may represent a promising treatment strategy for osteosarcoma.""","""['Pengcheng Li', 'Xun Zheng', 'Kangquan Shou', 'Yahui Niu', 'Chao Jian', 'Yong Zhao', 'Wanrong Yi', 'Xiang Hu', 'Aixi Yu']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Iron chelator-induced up-regulation of Ndrg1 inhibits proliferation and EMT process by targeting Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in colon cancer cells.', 'Î²-Elemonic acid inhibits the growth of human Osteosarcoma through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated PERK/eIF2Î±/ATF4/CHOP activation and Wnt/Î²-catenin signal suppression.', 'The Anticancer Agent, Di-2-Pyridylketone 4,4-Dimethyl-3-Thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), Up-Regulates the AMPK-Dependent Energy Homeostasis Pathway in Cancer Cells.', 'Paris polyphylla Suppresses Proliferation and Vasculogenic Mimicry of Human Osteosarcoma Cells and Inhibits Tumor Growth In Vivo.', 'Innovative therapies for neuroblastoma: The surprisingly potent role of iron chelation in up-regulating metastasis and tumor suppressors and down-regulating the key oncogene, N-myc.', 'Thiosemicarbazones and selected tyrosine kinase inhibitors synergize in pediatric solid tumors: NDRG1 upregulation and impaired prosurvival signaling in neuroblastoma cells.', 'Identification of an Iron Metabolism-Related lncRNA Signature for Predicting Osteosarcoma Survival and Immune Landscape.', 'Osteosarcoma in Children: Not Only Chemotherapy.', 'Targeting iron metabolism in cancer therapy.', 'Iron Chelator Induces Apoptosis in Osteosarcoma Cells by Disrupting Intracellular Iron Homeostasis and Activating the MAPK Pathway.']"""

The protein kinase D (PKD) family, particularly PKD1, has been implicated in prostate cancer biology. Here, we examined the cross-regulation of PKD1 by androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells. Our data showed that the transcription of PKD1 was repressed by androgen in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Steroid depletion caused up regulation of PKD1 transcript and protein, an effect that was reversed by the AR agonist R1881 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, thus identifying PKD1 as a novel androgen-repressed gene. Kinetic analysis indicated that the repression of PKD1 by androgen required the induction of a repressor protein. Furthermore, inhibition or knockdown of AR reversed AR agonist-induced PKD1 repression, indicating that AR was required for the suppression of PKD1 expression by androgen. Downstream of AR, we identified fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) and its downstream MEK/ERK pathway as mediators of androgen-induced PKD1 repression. In summary, PKD1 was identified as a novel androgen-suppressed gene and could be downregulated by androgen through a novel AR/FRS2/MEK/ERK pathway. The upregulation of prosurvival PKD1 by anti-androgens may contribute to therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Liyong Zhang', 'Zhenlong Zhao', 'Shuping Xu', 'Manuj Tandon', 'Courtney R LaValle', 'Fan Deng', 'Q Jane Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'The NLR-related protein NWD1 is associated with prostate cancer and modulates androgen receptor signaling.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', 'Protein Kinase D2 and D3 Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Bone Metastasis by Positively Regulating Runx2 in a MEK/ERK1/2-Dependent Manner.', 'Protein Kinase D: A Potential Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer.', 'Protein Kinase D1 Is Increased in Tumor Tissue, Correlates With Advanced Tumor Features and Worse Prognosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Molecular determinants of response to high-dose androgen therapy in prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate metformin's effect on clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with pancreatic cancer treated with curative resection.  Results:   A total of 764 patients underwent curative resection, met none of the exclusion criteria, and were prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents. The cancer-specific survival (5-year, 31.9% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in the 530 metformin users than in the 234 diabetic metformin non-users. After multivariable adjustments, metformin users had significantly lower cancer-specific mortality as compared with metformin non-users (hazard ratio, 0.727; 95% confidence interval, 0.611-0.868).

Design:   Prospective population-based cohort.  Setting:   New South Wales (NSW) is the most populous state in Australia, with almost one third of the total national population.  Participants:   NSW Cancer Registry (NSWCR) records for prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2001-2009 were linked to the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) for 2000-2010. All patients in this study had a minimum of 12 months follow-up in the hospital episode records after their date of diagnosis as recorded by the NSWCR.  Main outcome measures:   Incidence of 'unknown' stage prostate cancer and cancer-specific survival.  Results:   Of 50 597 prostate cancer cases, 39.9% were recorded as having 'unknown' stage. Up to 4 months after diagnosis, 77.2% of cases without a hospital-reported cancer diagnosis were recorded as having 'unknown' stage. Among those patients with a hospital-reported cancer diagnosis, stage was 'unknown' for 7.6% of cases who received a radical prostatectomy (RP) and for 34.0% of cases who had procedures other than RP. In the latter group, the factors that were related to having 'unknown' stage were living in disadvantaged areas (adjusted OR (aOR) range: 1.13 to 1.20), attending a private hospital (aOR range: 1.25 to 2.13), having day-only admission for care (aOR=1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36), or having procedures other than multiple procedures with imaging (eg, biopsy only, aOR range: 1.11 to 1.45).  Conclusions:   Over half of 'unknown' stage prostate cancer cases did not have a hospital-reported prostate cancer diagnosis within the 4 months after initial diagnosis.

Here we compare their performance for prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   Ten prostate patients were planned using IMPT with robustness optimization, VMAT, and 4Ï to an initial dose of 54 Gy to a clinical target volume (CTV) that encompassed the prostate and seminal vesicles, then a boost prescription dose of 25.2 Gy to the prostate for a total dose of 79.2 Gy. The IMPT plans utilized two coplanar, oblique scanning beams 10Â° posterior of the lateral beam positions. Range uncertainties were taken into consideration in the IMPT plans. VMAT plans used two full, coplanar arcs to ensure sufficient PTV coverage. 4Ï plans were created by inversely selecting and optimizing 30 beams from 1162 candidate non-coplanar beams using a greedy column generation algorithm. CTV doses, bladder and rectum dose volumes (V40, V45, V60, V65, V70, V75, and V80), R100, R50, R10, and CTV homogeneity index (D95/D5) were evaluated.  Results:   Compared to IMPT, 4Ï resulted in lower anterior rectal wall mean dose as well as lower rectum V40, V45, V60, V65, V70, and V75. Due to the opposing beam arrangement, IMPT resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) greater femoral head doses. However, IMPT plans had significantly lower bladder, rectum, and anterior rectal wall max dose. IMPT doses were also significantly more homogeneous than 4Ï and VMAT doses.  Conclusion:   Compared to the VMAT and 4Ï plans, IMPT treatment plans are superior in CTV homogeneity and maximum point organ-at-risk (OAR) doses with the exception of femur heads. IMPT is inferior in rectum and bladder volumes receiving intermediate to high doses, particularly to the 4Ï plans, but significantly reduced low dose spillage and integral dose, which are correlated to secondary cancer for patients with expected long survival. The dosimetric benefits of 4Ï plans over VMAT are consistent with the previous publication.""","""['Angelia Tran', 'Jingjing Zhang', 'Kaley Woods', 'Victoria Yu', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Gary Gustafson', 'Lane Rosen', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['In regard to ""Tran A, Zhang J, Woods K, Yu V, Nguyen D, Gustafson G, Rosen L, Sheng K.

Oncological outcome was quantified by biochemical recurrence free survival using the Stuttgart and Phoenix criteria. Quality of life was assessed by usage of standardized QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. In addition, functional questionnaires such as IPSS and IIEF-5 were used. Complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   One hundred thirty-one patients with a mean age of 72.8 years (SD: 6.0) underwent HIFU for prostate cancer (29.0% low risk, 58.8% intermediate risk, 12.2% high risk). PSA nadir was 0.6 ng/ml (SD: 1.2) after a mean of 4.6 months (SD: 5.7). Biochemical recurrence free survival defined by Stuttgart criteria was 73.7%, 84.4% and 62.5% for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients after 22.2 months. Complications were grouped according to Clavien-Dindo and occurred in 10.7% (grade II) and 11.5% (grade IIIa) of cases. 35.1% of patients needed further treatment for bladder neck stricture. Regarding incontinence, 14.3%, 2.9% and 0% of patients had de novo urinary incontinence grade IÂ°, IIÂ° and IIIÂ° and 3.8% urge incontinence due to HIFU treatment.

One of the main players in controlling OXPHOS is the mitochondrial gatekeeperpyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and its major subunit is E1Î± (PDHA1). To further analyze the function of PDHA1 in cancer cells, it was knock out (KO) in the human prostate cancer cell line LnCap and a stable KO cell line was established. We demonstrated that PDHA1 gene KO significantly decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and promoted anaerobic glycolysis, accompanied with higher stemness phenotype including resistance to chemotherapy, enhanced migration ability and increased expression of cancer stem cell markers. We also examined PDHA1 protein expression in prostate cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry and observed that reduced PDHA1 protein expression in clinical prostate carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor prognosis.

To verify the accuracy of MR-based dose calculations, institutions interested in introducing MR-only planning will have to compare pCT-based and computer tomography (CT)-based dose calculations. However, interpreting such comparison studies may be challenging, since potential differences arise from a range of confounding factors which are not necessarily specific to MR-only planning. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify and quantify the contribution of factors confounding dosimetric accuracy estimation in comparison studies between CT and pCT. The following factors were distinguished: set-up and positioning differences between imaging sessions, MR-related geometric inaccuracy, pCT generation, use of specific calibration curves to convert pCT into electron density information, and registration errors. The study comprised fourteen prostate cancer patients who underwent CT/MRI-based treatment planning. To enable pCT generation, a commercial solution (MRCAT, Philips Healthcare, Vantaa, Finland) was adopted. IMRT plans were calculated on CT (gold standard) and pCTs. Dose difference maps in a high dose region (CTV) and in the body volume were evaluated, and the contribution to dose errors of possible confounding factors was individually quantified. We found that the largest confounding factor leading to dose difference was the use of different calibration curves to convert pCT and CT into electron density (0.7%). The second largest factor was the pCT generation which resulted in pCT stratified into a fixed number of tissue classes (0.16%). Inter-scan differences due to patient repositioning, MR-related geometric inaccuracy, and registration errors did not significantly contribute to dose differences (0.01%). The proposed approach successfully identified and quantified the factors confounding accurate MRI-based dose calculation in the prostate.

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine the effects of a short-term intervention with selenium on gene expression in non-malignant prostate tissue. Twenty-three men received 300 Âµg selenium per day in the form of selenized yeast (n=12) or a placebo (n=11) during 5 weeks. Prostate biopsies collected from the transition zone before and after intervention were analysed for 15 participants (n=8 selenium, n=7 placebo). Pathway analyses revealed that the intervention with selenium was associated with down-regulated expression of genes involved in cellular migration, invasion, remodeling and immune responses. Specifically, expression of well-established epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule EPCAM, was up-regulated, while the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin were down-regulated after intervention with selenium. This implies an inhibitory effect of selenium on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, selenium was associated with down-regulated expression of genes involved in wound healing and inflammation; processes which are both related to EMT.

Our institution's active surveillance regimen uses annual MRI in place of serial biopsies, and biopsies are performed only when clinically necessary. The objective of our study was to report the multiparametric MRI characteristics of prostate cancer patients who discontinued active surveillance at our institution after repeat imaging revealed possible evidence of tumor upgrading.  Materials and methods:   The Department of Urology at Winthrop University Hospital prospectively maintains a database of prostate cancer patients who are monitored with active surveillance. At the time of this study, there were 200 prostate cancer patients being monitored with active surveillance. Of those patients, 114 patients had an initial multiparametric MRI study that was performed before active surveillance started and at least one follow-up multiparametric MRI study that was performed after active surveillance began. The MRI findings were evaluated and correlated with pathology results, if available.  Results:   Fourteen patients discontinued active surveillance because changes on follow-up MRI suggested progression of cancer. Follow-up MRI showed an enlarged or more prominent lesion compared with the appearance on a previous MRI in three (21.4%) patients, a new lesion or lesions suspicious for cancer in two (14.3%) patients, and findings suspicious for or confirming extracapsular extension in nine (64.3%) patients. Seven of the 14 (50.0%) patients had a biopsy after follow-up multiparametric MRI, and biopsy results led to tumor upgrading in six of the 14 (42.9%) patients. The duration of active surveillance ranged from 4 to 110 months. All patients received definitive treatment.  Conclusion:   The small number of patients with follow-up multiparametric MRI findings showing worsening disease supports the role of MRI in patients with early-stage prostate cancer. Multiparametric MRI is useful in monitoring patients on active surveillance and may identify patients with clinically significant cancer amenable to definitive treatment.""","""['David J Habibian', 'Corinne C Liu', 'Alex Dao', 'Kaitlin E Kosinski', 'Aaron E Katz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging findings in men with low-risk prostate cancer followed using active surveillance.', 'Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Incremental Value.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging facilitates reclassification during active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'The Emerging Role of MRI in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance and Ongoing Challenges.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Serial prostate magnetic resonance imaging fails to predict pathological progression in patients on active surveillance.', 'Active Surveillance Strategies for Low-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparative Benefits and Cost-effectiveness.', 'Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer Using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Review of the Current Role and Future Perspectives.', 'Trends in Gene Expression Profiling for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review.', 'Indications for and transitioning to secondary treatment while on active surveillance for prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Men who underwent RP between 2008 and 2012 in England were identified using hospital administrative data. A transparent coding framework based on procedure codes was developed to identify severe urinary complications which were grouped into 'stricture', 'incontinence' and 'other'. Their validity as a performance indicator was assessed by evaluating the consistency with diagnosis codes and association with patient and surgical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess time to first occurrence and multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for patient and surgical characteristics.  Results:   A total of 17 299 men were included, of whom 2695 (15.6%) experienced at least one severe urinary complication within 2 years. High proportions of men with a complication had relevant diagnosis codes: 86% for strictures and 93% for incontinence. Urinary complications were more common in men from poorer socio-economic backgrounds (OR comparing lowest with highest quintile: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-1.67) and in those with prolonged length of hospital stay (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.40-1.69), and were less common in men who underwent robot-assisted surgery (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.74).

The growth and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells were determined by the trypan blue exclusion and propidium iodide staining assays. Activation of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) was measured by luciferase reporter assay, and the levels of phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 were determined by western blot analysis. Mice were injected subcutaneously with PC-3 cells in Matrigel. After 4-6 weeks, mice with PC-3 tumors received i.p. injections of vehicle, atorvastatin (5 mg/kg), aspirin (80 mg/kg), or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg) + aspirin (80 mg/kg) three times a week for 30 days. Our results demonstrated the combination of atorvastatin and aspirin had more potent effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis stimulation in prostate cancer cells than either drug alone. Mechanistic studies indicated the induction of apoptosis in PC-3 cells was associated with strong inhibition of NF-ÎºB and decreases in the levels of phospho-Stat3 and phospho-Erk1/2.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a 12âmonth physical exercise program on inflammatory and cardiometabolic parameters, as well as on functional status in patients with PCa undergoing RT and ADT. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a randomized controlled clinical trial including 72 men with highârisk and intermediateârisk PCa, allocated to 2 groups before RT. The physical exercise group trained 5 days/ wk during RT and then 3 days/wk. The control group received usual care according to recommendations. Measurements were performed at baseline, after RT (8 weeks), and after 10 months. The parameters assessed were proinflammatory cytokine levels, lipid profile, aerobic capacity, body mass index (BMI), waistâtoâhip ratio (WHR), and functional status (FACTâF and EORTC questionnaires). RESULTS We observed an significant improvement in functional capacity, BMI, and WHR, and a decrease in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and fatigue in the exercise group compared with controls after 12 months. The level of fatigue was significantly higher in controls than in the exercise group, especially after RT.

For a cohort with hydrogel prostate-rectum spacers, we asked whether it was possible to generate AO proton plans robust to end-of-range elevations in linear energy transfer (LET) and modeled relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Additionally we considered how rectal spacers influenced planned dose distributions for AO and standard bilateral (SB) proton beams versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Material and methods:   We studied three treatment strategies for 10 patients with rectal spacers: (A) AO proton beams, (B) SB proton beams and (C) IMRT. For strategy (A) dose and LET distributions were simulated (using the TOPAS Monte Carlo platform) and the McNamara model was used to calculate proton RBE as a function of LET, dose per fraction, and photon Î±/Î². All calculations were performed on pretreatment scans: inter- and intra-fractional changes in anatomy/set-up were not considered.  Results:   For 9/10 patients, rectal spacers enabled generation of AO proton plans robust to modeled RBE elevations: rectal dose constraints were fulfilled even when the variable RBE model was applied with a conservative Î±/Î² = 2 Gy. Amongst a subset of patients the proton rectal doses for the planning target volume plans were remarkably low: for 2/10 SB plans and 4/10 AO plans, â¤10% of the rectum received â¥20 Gy. AO proton plans delivered integral doses a factor of approximately three lower than IMRT and spared the femoral heads almost entirely.  Conclusion:   Typically, rectal spacers enabled the generation of anterior beam proton plans that appeared robust to modeled variation in RBE. However, further analysis of day-to-day robustness would be required prior to a clinical implementation of AO proton beams. Such beams offer almost complete femoral head sparing, but their broader value relative to IMRT and SB protons remains unclear.""","""['Tracy S A Underwood', 'Justin C Voog', 'Maryam Moteabbed', 'Shikui Tang', 'Edward Soffen', 'Oren Cahlon', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Harald Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Can We Advance Proton Therapy for Prostate?

Since the first structured robotic program was launched in 2000, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has had a rapid diffusion and surpassed its open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) counterparts in the United States and is progressively expanding in other countries. Interestingly, this common acceptance of RARP was initially driven in the paucity of robust clinical evidence.

In that scenario, the clinician has to rely on retrospective data and systemic and meta-analyses. In comparison with ORP and LRP, RARP has proven to reach at least equivalent oncological outcomes. Lower rate of positive surgical margins may probably be achieved with RARP in pT2 patients. Although urologists were initially reluctant to embrace RARP in high-risk patients and lymph node yield was low, contemporary series have revealed that RARP and extended lymphadenectomy may be safely performed with obtaining similar (or better) nodal yields compared with ORP. Surgeon experience is universally of utmost importance in obtaining good outcomes. We will need to wait for long-term results of contemporary series to comprehend the impact of RARP on cancer-specific survival and overall survival.

Patients with a suspicious anterior lesion on MRI underwent targeted anterior gland TRUS-guided biopsy with cognitive fusion technique using sagittal probe orientation. PIRADS version 1 scores (T2, DWI, and overall), lesion size, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, and prostate gland volume were compared between positive and negative biopsy groups and between clinically significant cancer and remaining cases.

Metabolomics-based biomarker discovery would greatly benefit from the ability to interrogate retrospective annotated clinical specimens archived as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis was performed in matched frozen and FFPE human prostate cancers as well as isogenic prostate cancer cell lines. A total of 352 and 460 metabolites were profiled in human tissues and cell lines, respectively. Classes and physical-chemical characteristics of the metabolites preserved in FFPE material were characterized and related to their preservation or loss following fixation and embedding. Metabolite classes were differentially preserved in archival FFPE tissues, regardless of the age of the block, compared with matched frozen specimen, ranging from maximal preservation of fatty acids (78%) to loss of the majority of peptides and steroids. Generally, FFPE samples showed a decrease of metabolites with functional groups, such as carboxamide. As an adjunct technique, metabolic profiles were also obtained in situ from FFPE tissue sections where metabolites were extracted in a manner that preserves tissue architecture. Despite the fact that selected metabolites were not retained after processing, global metabolic profiles obtained from FFPE can be used to predict biologic states and study biologic pathways. These results pave the way for metabolomics-based biomarker discovery/validation utilizing retrospective and clinically annotated FFPE collections.Implications: Metabolic profiles can be performed in archival tissue and may be used to complement other profiling methods such as gene expression for biomarker discovery or pathway analysis in the assessment of biologic states.

Factors and manufacturing procedures essential for these therapeutics to induce effective antitumor immune responses have yet to be fully characterized. We here aimed to identify DC markers correlating with clinical and immunologic response in a prostate carcinoma vaccination regimen.Experimental Design: We performed an extensive characterization of DCs used to vaccinate 18 patients with prostate carcinoma enrolled in a pilot trial of T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein (TARP) peptide vaccination (NCT00908258). Peptide-pulsed DC preparations (114) manufactured were analyzed by gene expression profiling, cell surface marker expression and cytokine release secretion, and correlated with clinical and immunologic responses.Results: DCs showing lower expression of tolerogenic gene signature induced strong antigen-specific immune response and slowing in PSA velocity, a surrogate for clinical response. These DCs were also characterized by lower surface expression of CD14, secretion of IL10 and MCP-1, and greater secretion of MDC. When combined, these four factors were able to remarkably discriminate DCs that were sufficiently potent to induce strong immunologic response.Conclusions: DC factors essential for the activation of immune responses associated with TARP vaccination in prostate cancer patients were identified. This study highlights the importance of in-depth characterization of DC vaccines and other cellular therapies, to understand the critical factors that hinder potency and potential efficacy in patients.

Materials and methods:   A stereo imaging module that enables 3D position determination and couch correction of the patient based on images acquired at any arbitrary angle and arbitrary angular separation was developed and incorporated to the in-house SeedTracker real-time position monitoring system. The accuracy of the developed system was studied by imaging an anthropomorphic phantom implanted with radiopaque markers set to known offset positions from its reference position in an Elekta linear accelerator (LA) and associated XVI imaging system. The accuracy of the system was further validated using CBCT data set from 10 prostate SBRT patients. The time gains achieved with the stereo image based position correction was compared with the manual matching of seed positions in Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and kV images in the Mosaiq record and verify system.  Results:   Based on phantom and patient CBCT dataset study stereo imaging module implemented in the SeedTracker shown to have an accuracy of 0.1(Ï=0.5)mm in detecting the 3D position offset. The time comparison study showed that stereo image based methodology implemented in SeedTracker was a minimum of 80(4)s faster than the manual method implemented in Mosaiq R&V system with a maximum time saving of 146(6)s.

We evaluated the prevalence of PC during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and correlate the ultrasonographic patterns with histological findings.  Methods:   A prospective study of 664 patients undergoing TRUS and prostate biopsy was planned. A standardized reproducible technique was used with using a GE Logiq 7 machine equipped with a 5-9MHz multi-frequency convex probe ""end-fire"". We defined marked presence of PC as multiple hyperechoic foci with significant area (â¥ 3 mm in the largest diameter). PC were classified according to zone distribution into the gland: transitional zone (TZ), central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ).  Results:   No significant difference was noted between the patients with PC and without PC, when comparing age, preoperative PSA level, prostate volume, and biopsy number, except for DRE findings. 168 patients (25.3%) had marked presence of PC on TRUS: 50.6% in TZ, 20.2% in CZ, and 29.2% in PZ. 31 patients (63.3%) with presence of PC in PZ had CaP on biopsy. The correlation observed between CaP and the presence of PC in PZ was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). However, among patients in the CaP group there was no statistical association between PC and moderate or high Gleason grade.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that chronic prostatic inflammation and PC have a role in the biogenesis of cancer.

Materials and methods:   59 consecutive patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCA) underwent prostate biopsy using Trinity KoelisÂ® (Koelis, Grenoble, France). We divided the patients into 2 groups: patients with a previous negative mapping underwent to a MRI/US fusion re-biopsy (Group A); and biopsy-naÃ¯ve patients who underwent to a first stereotactic 3-D mapping of the prostate (Group B). Group A (22 patients):mean age 64 years (CI 48-73), mean PSA = 7.7 ng/ml (CI 4.2- 9.9); mean prostate volume 55 ml(CI 45-82), Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) positive in 2/22, number of lesions detected by MRI 1.4, mean cores from each MRI target lesion 3 (CI 2-5), mean total cores 15 ( CI 12-19). Group B (37 patients): mean age 66 years (CI 49-77), mean PSA= 4.7 (3.2- 7.9); mean prostate volume 45 ml (33-67), DRE positive in 5/37, mean total cores 14 ( CI 10-16) Results: In Group A 10/22 patients were positive for PCA (overall detection rate of 45.5%): 6 PCA were detected by target biopsy and 4 cancer by random biopsy. Significant prostate cancer (defined as the presence of Gleason pattern 4) was detected in 4/10 patients (Significant PCA detection rate of 40%) and all significant PCA were detected by MRI target biopsy. All PCA detected by random biopsy had Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6. In Group B (biopsy naÃ¯ve patients) 14/37 patients were positive for PCA (overall detection rate of 37.8%), Significant prostate cancer was detected in 5/14 patients (Significant PCA detection rate of 35,7%).

This new technique is based on two operative options: the first based on target biopsies, the Cognitive Target Biopsy (CTB) if the same target was detected with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMRI); the second based on saturation biopsies, the Zonal Saturation Biopsy (ZSB) on anatomical zone/s containing the region of interest if the same target was not evident with TRUS and MRI. We evaluated results of our technique compared to standard biopsy in order to identify clinically relevant prostate cancer.  Methods:   This is a single-center prospective study conducted in 58 pts: 25 biopsy-naÃ¯ve, 25 with previous negative biopsy and in 8 with cancer in active surveillance. Based on mpMRI and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), all patients were scheduled for standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy. If mpMRI was suggestive or positive (PI-RADS 3, 4 or 5): patients underwent additional targeted 2 to 6 cores using cognitive zonal fusion technique.  Results:   31/58 (53.4%) patients had a cancer. Our technique detected 80.6% (25 of 31) with clinically significant prostate cancer, leading to detection of insignificant cancer in 20%. Using standard mapping in MR negative areas we found 5 clinically significant cancer and 4 not significant cancers. MRI cancer detection rate was 18/31 (58.1%), and 9/18 (50%) in high grade tumors. Therefore MRI missed 50% of high grade cancers. The mean number of cores taken with cognitive zonal fusion biopsy was 6.1 (2-17), in addition biopsy sampling was done outside the ROI areas. Overall 15.4 cores (12-22) were taken. Cancer amount in Zonal Biopsy was larger than 7.3 mm (1-54.5) in comparison with 5.2 mm (1-23.5) in standard mapping. Largest percentage of cancer involvement with cognitive zonal fusion technique was detected in 19.4% vs 15.9%.  Conclusions:   Cognitive Zonal Saturation Biopsies should be used to reduce operator variability of cognitive fusion biopsy in addition to standard biopsy. Cognitive zonal biopsy based on mpMRI findings identifies clinically relevant prostate in 80%, has larger cancer extension in fusion biopsies than in random biopsies, and reduce the number of cores if compared to saturation biopsy.""","""['Andrea B Galosi', 'Guevar Maselli', 'Giulia Sbrollini', 'Gaetano Donatelli', 'Lorenzo Montesi', 'Matteo TallÃ¨', 'Rodolfo Montironi']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Transperineal Versus Transrectal MRI/TRUS Fusion Targeted Biopsy: Detection Rate of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection rate for significant cancer at confirmatory biopsy in men enrolled in Active Surveillance protocol: 20 cores vs 30 cores vs MRI/TRUS fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI/TRUS Fusion Prostate Biopsy: Advantages of a Transperineal Approach.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Here, we explored the mechanistic basis of this finding. We first confirmed our clinical observation by testing hSef manipulation in an in vivo metastasis model. hSef stable expressing cells (PC3M-hSef) or empty vector controls (PC3M-EV) were injected subcutaneously into the lateral thoracic walls of NOD-SCID gamma mice and lungs were harvested at autopsy. In this model, 6/7 PC3M-EV xenografts had definitive lung micro-metastasis whilst only 1/6 PC3M-hSef xenografts exhibited metastasis recapitulating the clinical scenario (p = 0.03). Gene expression studies revealed key perturbations in genes involved in cell motility and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with alterations in cognate signaling pathways. These results were validated in an EMT specific PCR array whereby hSef over-expression and silencing reciprocally altered E-Cadherin expression (p = <0.001) amongst other EMT markers. Immunohistochemistry of excised tumors from the xenografts also confirmed the effect of hSef in suppressing E-Cadherin expression at the protein level. Phosphokinase arrays further demonstrated a role for hSef in attenuating signaling of not only ERK-MAPK but also the JNK and p38 pathways as well. Taken together, these data suggest evidence that loss of hSef may be a critical event facilitating tumor dissemination of prostate cancer through alteration of EMT. Detection of downregulated hSef, along with other negative regulators, may therefore be a useful biomarker heralding a transition to a metastatic phenotype and warrants further exploration in this context.""","""['Satoshi Hori', 'Karan Wadhwa', 'Venkat Pisupati', 'Vincent Zecchini', 'Antonio Ramos-Montoya', 'Anne Y Warren', 'David E Neal', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Similar expression to FGF (Sef) inhibits fibroblast growth factor-induced tumourigenic behaviour in prostate cancer cells and is downregulated in aggressive clinical disease.', 'Loss of Sef (similar expression to FGF) expression is associated with high grade and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Delivery of the gene encoding the tumor suppressor Sef into prostate tumors by therapeutic-ultrasound inhibits both tumor angiogenesis and growth.', 'Epithelial requirement for in vitro proliferation and xenograft growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells: oncogenic rather than tumor-suppressive role of E-cadherin.', 'The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in hepatocyte-mediated phenotypic switching in prostate cancer cells.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.', 'Thymoquinone upregulates IL17RD in controlling the growth and metastasis of triple negative breast cancer cells in vitro.', 'TPM3 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in esophageal cancer via MMP2/MMP9.', 'MicroRNA-449a inhibits cell proliferation and migration by regulating mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'Several Fusion Genes Identified in a Spermatic Cord Leiomyoma With Rearrangements of Chromosome Arms 3p and 21q.']"""

The study aims to screen key microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) involved in PC.The miRNA expression profile dataset (GSE45604) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 50 PC and 10 normal specimens. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified through limma package in R, and DEmiRNA-DEmiRNA co-regulation network was constructed based on the number of co-regulated target genes. Functional enrichment analysis of co-regulated target genes was performed using clusterProfiler package in R, and miRNA interactions sharing at least 1 functional term were used to construct a DEmiRNA-DEmiRNA functional synergistic network (MFSN). Based on Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database, cancer-related TFs which were co-regulated by DEmiRNAs were utilized to construct a DEmiRNA-TF regulation network.A total of 66 DEmiRNAs were identified, including 7 up-regulated miRNAs with 18,642 target genes and 59 down-regulated miRNAs with 130,694 target genes. Then, the DEmiRNA-DEmiRNA co-regulation network was constructed, including 66 DEmiRNAs and 2024 co-regulation relationships. In MFSN, hsa-miR-1184, hsa-miR-1207-5p, and hsa-miR-24 had significant functional synergistic relationships.

Methods:   Data from 27 122 patients treated with RP at seven European centers were analyzed. We investigated the prognostic performance of the new Grade Groups (based on Gleason score 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, 8 and 9-10) on biopsy and RP specimen, adjusted for established clinical and pathological characteristics. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed the association of new Grade Groups with biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prognostic accuracies of the models were assessed using Harrell's C-index.  Results:   Median follow-up was 29 months (interquartile range, 13-54). The 4-year estimated BCR-free survival (bRFS) for biopsy Grade Groups 1-5 were 91.3, 81.6, 69.8, 60.3 and 44.4%, respectively. The 4-year estimated bRFS for RP Grade Groups 1-5 were 96.1%, 86.7%, 67.0%, 63.1% and 41.0%, respectively. Compared with Grade Group 1, all other Grade Groups based both on biopsy and RP specimen were independently associated with a lower bRFS (all P<0.01). Adjusted pairwise comparisons revealed statistically differences between all Grade Groups, except for group 3 and 4 on RP specimen (P=0.10). The discriminations of the multivariable base prognostic models based on the current three-tier and the new five-tier systems were not clinically different (0.3 and 0.9% increase in discrimination for clinical and pathological model).  Conclusions:   We validated the independent prognostic value of the new Grade Groups on biopsy and RP specimen from European PCa men.

Metformin exposure was defined as a time-dependent variable, stratified first into any use, and into tertiles of cumulative dose. Surname algorithms identified individuals as Chinese or non-Chinese.

HWSE depends on three underlying conditions: (1) leaving work predicts future exposure, (2) leaving work is associated with disease outcome and (3) prior exposure increases probability of leaving work. If all these conditions are satisfied, then employment status is a time-varying confounder affected by prior exposure, and standard regression will produce bias. We assessed these conditions for cancer outcomes in a cohort of autoworkers exposed to metalworking fluids (MWF).  Methods:   The cohort includes 31 485 workers followed for cancer incidence from 1985 to 1994. As occupational exposures to straight, soluble and synthetic MWFs are necessarily zero after leaving work, condition (1) is satisfied. Cox models for cancer incidence and for employment termination were used to assess conditions (2) and (3), respectively. Employment termination by select ages was examined to better gauge the presence of condition (2).  Results:   The HR for leaving work as a predictor of all cancers combined and prostate cancer was null, but elevated for lung and colorectal cancers among men. Condition (2) was more clearly satisfied for all cancer outcomes when leaving work occurred by age 50. Higher exposures to all three MWF types were associated with increased rates of leaving work (condition (3)), with the exception of straight MWF among women.  Conclusions:   We found evidence for the structural conditions underlying HWSE in a cohort of autoworkers.

However, emerging data have also shown that even BRCA-mutant cells may be resistant to PARPi. The mechanistic basis for these drug resistances is poorly understood. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell-cycle events, is significantly elevated upon castration of mice carrying xenograft prostate tumors. Herein, by combination with Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, we show a robust sensitization of olaparib in 22RV1, a BRCA1-deficient CRPC cell line, as well as in CRPC xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, monotherapy with olaparib results in an override of the G1-S checkpoint, leading to high expression of Plk1, which attenuates olaparib's overall efficacy. In BRCA1 wild-type C4-2 cells, Plk1 inhibition also significantly increases the efficacy of olaparib in the presence of p53 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings not only implicate the critical role of Plk1 in PARPi resistance in BRCA-mutant CRPC cells, but also shed new light on the treatment of non-BRCA-mutant patient subgroups who might also respond favorably to PARPi.

Thus, antioxidant therapies have gained attention as adjuvants for castration-resistant PCa. Here, we report for the first time that human endostatin (ES) prevents androgen-independent growth phenotype in PCa cells through its molecular targeting of AR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and downstream pro-oxidant signaling. This reversal after ES treatment significantly decreased PCa cell proliferation through down-regulation of GR and up-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione levels. Proteome and biochemical analyses of ES-treated PCa cells further indicated a significant up-regulation of enzymes in the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging machinery, including catalase, glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, biliverdin reductase, and thioredoxin reductase, resulting in a concomitant reduction of intracellular ROS. ES further augmented the antioxidant system through up-regulation of glucose influx, the pentose phosphate pathway, and NAD salvaging pathways. This shift in cancer cell redox homeostasis by ES significantly decreased the effect of protumorigenic oxidative machinery on androgen-independent PCa growth, suggesting that ES can suppress GR-induced resistant phenotype upon AR antagonism and that the dual targeting action of ES on AR and GR can be further translated to PCa therapy.-Lee, J.

Through interaction with nucleosomes, transcription factors, nucleosome-remodeling machines and histones, the HMGs family proteins contribute to the fine tuning of transcription in response to rapid environmental changes. Mammalian high mobility group Bs (HMGBs) are characterized by two tandem HMG box domains followed by a long acidic tail. Recent studies demonstrated that high expression of HMGBs has been found in many cancers, such as prostate, kidney, ovarian, and gastric cancers. However, their roles in pancreatic cancer have seldom been reported. In this study, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic values of HMGBs proteins, including HMGB1, HMGB2, and HMGB3, in pancreatic cancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Our results demonstrated that HMGB2 predicted poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that silencing HMGB2 inhibited cell proliferation and viability. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that silencing HMGB2 decreased hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1Î±) protein level and inhibited HIF1Î±-mediated glycolysis process.

Although there is growing interest in the management of the physical capability of patients with bone metastasis, the mechanism underlying the impairment of bone mechanical function remains unclear. The alignment of both collagen fibrils and biological apatite (BAp) c-axis, together with bone mineral density, is one of the strongest contributors to bone mechanical function. In this study, we analyzed the bone microstructure of the mouse femurs with and without PCa cell inoculation. Histological assessment revealed that the bone-forming pattern in the PCa-bearing bone was non-directional, resulting in a spongious structure, whereas that in the control bone was unidirectional and layer-by-layer, resulting in a compact lamellar structure. The degree of preferential alignment of collagen fibrils and BAp, which was evaluated by quantitative polarized microscopy and microbeam X-ray diffraction, respectively, were significantly lower in the PCa-bearing bone than in the control bone. Material parameters including Young's modulus and toughness, measured by the three-point bending test, were simultaneously decreased in the PCa-bearing bone. Specifically, there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of BAp c-axis orientation and Young's modulus. In conclusion, the impairment of mechanical function in the PCa-bearing bone is attributable to disruption of the anisotropic microstructure of bone in multiple phases. This is the first report demonstrating that cancer bone metastasis induces disruption of the collagen/BAp alignment in long bones, thereby impairing their mechanical function.""","""['Aiko Sekita', 'Aira Matsugaki', 'Takayoshi Nakano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Synchronous disruption of anisotropic arrangement of the osteocyte network and collagen/apatite in melanoma bone metastasis.', 'Optimally oriented grooves on dental implants improve bone quality around implants under repetitive mechanical loading.', 'Quantitative regulation of bone-mimetic, oriented collagen/apatite matrix structure depends on the degree of osteoblast alignment on oriented collagen substrates.', 'Anisotropic crystallization of biominerals.', 'A paradigm shift for bone quality in dentistry: A literature review.', 'Identification of Immune Infiltration in Odontogenic Keratocyst by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.', 'Exploring the role of differentially expressed metabolic genes and their mechanisms in bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Multidimensional outlook on the pathophysiology of cervical cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Microfluidic Co-culture Platforms for Studying Osteocyte Regulation of Other Cell Types under Dynamic Mechanical Stimulation.']"""

Recent in vitro data have suggested that dietary Ca can impair LYC micellarisation, but there is no evidence whether this can lead to decreased LYC absorption efficiency in humans. Our objective was to assess whether a nutritional dose of Ca impairs dietary LYC bioavailability and to study the mechanism(s) involved. First, in a randomised, two-way cross-over study, ten healthy adults consumed either a test meal that provided 19-mg (all-E)-LYC from tomato paste or the same meal plus 500-mg calcium carbonate as a supplement. Plasma LYC concentration was measured at regular time intervals over 7 h postprandially. In a second approach, an in vitro digestion model was used to assess the effect of increasing Ca doses on LYC micellarisation and on the size and zeta potential of the mixed micelles produced during digestion of a complex food matrix. LYC bioavailability was diminished by 83 % following the addition of Ca in the test meal. In vitro, Ca affected neither LYC micellarisation nor mixed micelle size but it decreased the absolute value of their charge by 39 %. In conclusion, a nutritional dose of Ca can impair dietary LYC bioavailability in healthy humans. This inhibition could be due to the fact that Ca diminishes the electrical charge of micelles. These results call for a thorough assessment of the effects of Ca, or other divalent minerals, on the bioavailability of other carotenoids and lipophilic micronutrients.""","""['Patrick Borel', 'C Desmarchelier', 'U Dumont', 'C Halimi', 'D Lairon', 'D Page', 'J L SÃ©bÃ©dio', 'C Buisson', 'C BuffiÃ¨re', 'D RÃ©mond']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Br J Nutr""","""['Carotenoids are more bioavailable from papaya than from tomato and carrot in humans: a randomised cross-over study.', 'Lycopene bioavailability is associated with a combination of genetic variants.', 'Compartmental and noncompartmental modeling of Â¹Â³C-lycopene absorption, isomerization, and distribution kinetics in healthy adults.', 'Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Carotenoids and Lycopenes Chemistry; Metabolism, Absorption, Nutrition, and Allied Health Claims--A Comprehensive Review.', 'Tomato products, lycopene, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Carotenoids and Their Health Benefits as Derived via Their Interactions with Gut Microbiota.', 'Chemistry, Occurrence, Properties, Applications, and Encapsulation of Carotenoids-A Review.', 'Insufficient Lycopene Intake Is Associated With High Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2010).', 'Whey- and Soy Protein Isolates Added to a Carrot-Tomato Juice Alter Carotenoid Bioavailability in Healthy Adults.', 'Are Processed Tomato Products as Nutritious as Fresh Tomatoes?

Different clinically relevant IGRT (image guided radiotherapy) scenarios were considered with regard to their influence on dosimetric plan quality and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).  Methods:   This study is based on treatment plans of 50 prostate patients. We evaluate the clinically performed IGRT and simulate the influence of different daily IGRT scenarios on plan quality. Imaging doses of planar and cone-beam-CT (CBCT) images for three different energies (6 MV, 1 MV and 121 kV) were added to the treatment plans. The plan quality of the different scenarios was assessed by a visual inspection of the dose distribution and dose-volume-histogram (DVH) and a statistical analysis of DVH criteria. In addition, an assessment of the normal tissue complication probability was performed.  Results:   Daily 1MV-CBCTs result in undesirable high dose regions in the target volume. The DVH shows that the scenarios with actual imaging performed, daily kV-CBCT and daily 6MV imaging (1x CBCT, 4x planar images per week) do not differ exceedingly from the original plan; especially imaging with daily kV-CBCT has little influence to the sparing of organs at risk. In contrast, daily 1MV- CBCT entails an additional dose of up to two fraction doses. Due to the additional dose amount some DVH constraints for plan acceptability could no longer be satisfied, especially for the daily 1MV-CBCT scenario. This scenario also shows increased NTCP for the rectum.  Conclusion:   Daily kV-CBCT has negligible influence on plan quality and is commendable for the clinical routine. If no kV-modality is available, a daily IGRT scenario with one CBCT per week and planar axial images on the other days should be preferred over daily MV-CBCT.""","""['Katharina Bell', 'Marina Heitfeld', 'Norbert Licht', 'Christian RÃ¼be', 'Yvonne Dzierma']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Image guidance and positioning accuracy in clinical practice: influence of positioning errors and imaging dose on the real dose distribution for head and neck cancer treatment.', 'Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Exposure Risks Among Children Undergoing Radiation Therapy: Considerations in the Era of Image Guided Radiation Therapy.', 'Quantitative evaluation of radiotherapy plan in precise external beam radiotherapy process management for cervical cancer.', 'Evaluation of IGRT-Induced Imaging Doses and Secondary Cancer Risk for SBRT Early Lung Cancer Patients In Silico Study.', 'Evaluation of a Novel Liquid Fiducial Marker, BioXmarkÂ®, for Small Animal Image-Guided Radiotherapy Applications.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'Image guidance and positioning accuracy in clinical practice: influence of positioning errors and imaging dose on the real dose distribution for head and neck cancer treatment.']"""

Methods A total of 141,578 men aged 55-69 were randomized to systematic screening or usual care in ERSPC sections in Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The excess number of deaths was defined as the difference between the observed number of deaths in the prostate cancer (PC) patients and the expected number of deaths up to 31 December 2006. The expected number was derived from mortality of all study participants before a diagnosis with PC adjusted for study centre, study arm and study attendance. The excess mortality rates were compared between the two study arms. Results The PC incidence was 9.25 per 1000 person-years in the intervention arm and 5.49 per 1000 person-years in the control arm, relative risk (RR) 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62-1.76). The excess mortality among men with PC was 0.29 per 1000 person-years in the intervention arm and 0.37 per 1000 person-years in the control arm; the RR for excess mortality was 0.77 (95% CI 0.55-1.08). The absolute risk reduction in the excess mortality was 0.08 per 1000 person-years. The overall mortality was not significantly different between the intervention and the control arms of the study: RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.01). Conclusions Although the reduction in excess mortality was not statistically significant, the between-arm reduction in excess mortality rate was in line with the previously reported 20% reduction in the disease-specific mortality.

Materials and methods:   The expression levels of hsa-miR-125a-3p were assessed in chemoresistant PCa tissues and experimentally established chemoresistant cells using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effect of hsa-miR-125a-3p knockdown or hsa-miR-125a-3p overexpression on the Dox-induced cell death was evaluated using apoptosis ELISA in chemosensitive PC-3 cells or in chemoresistant PC-3 cells (PC-3R). Finally, using multiple assays, the regulation of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), an essential component of the Mi-2-nucleosome remodeling deacetylation complex, by hsa-miR-125a-3p was studied at both molecular and functional levels.  Results:   The expression of hsa-miR-125a-3p was significantly downregulated in chemoresistant PCa tissues and cells. Inhibition of hsa-miR-125a-3p significantly increased docetaxel (Dox) resistance in PC-3 cells, whereas upregulation of hsa-miR-125a-3p effectively reduced Dox resistance in PC-3R, suggesting that this microRNA (miRNA) may act as a tumor suppressor along the pathogenesis of drug resistance.

Therefore, elucidating the mechanism that underlies resistance to docetaxel is critical to enhance therapeutic intervention. Mining cDNA microarray from the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line and its docetaxel-resistant derivative (PC3-TxR) revealed decreased latexin (LXN) expression in the resistant cells. LXN expression was inversely correlated with taxane resistance in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. LXN knockdown conferred docetaxel resistance to prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas LXN overexpression reduced docetaxel resistance in several prostate cancer cell lines. A mouse model of prostate cancer demonstrated that prostate cancer cells developed resistance to docetaxel in the bone microenvironment, but not the soft tissue microenvironment. This was associated with decreased LXN expression in prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment compared with the soft tissue microenvironment. It was identified that bone stromal cells decreased LXN expression through methylation and induced chemoresistance in prostate cancer in vitro These findings reveal that a subset of prostate cancer develops docetaxel resistance through loss of LXN expression associated with methylation and that the bone microenvironment promotes this drug resistance phenotype.Implications: This study suggests that the LXN pathway should be further explored as a viable target for preventing or reversing taxane resistance in prostate cancer.

Despite positive results in animal studies and a few human interventions with whole-grain rye on markers of prostate cancer progression, the feasibility of trials investigating such dietary changes in combination with physical activity remains largely unstudied. The primary aim was to investigate the feasibility of an intervention with high whole-grain rye intake and vigorous physical activity for 6 months in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Methods:   In total, 26 men (53-72 years) recently diagnosed with non-aggressive prostate cancer and on active surveillance, were enrolled in 2011-2012 and randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The intervention included 170 g/day of whole-grain rye and 3 Ã 45 minutes/week of vigorous physical activity. The duration of the intervention was 6 months and end of follow-up 12 months after baseline. Clinic visits were scheduled at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. Compliance with the intervention was evaluated by diaries, food frequency questionnaires, biomarkers, and heart rate monitor data. The effect of the intervention was evaluated by linear multiple regression analysis.  Results:   In the intervention group, the mean daily intake of whole-grain rye measured from diaries was 146 g (SD: 19) for the first 3 months and 125 g (SD: 40) for the last 3 months of the intervention. The median level (5th and 95th percentiles) of vigorous physical activity was 91 (17, 193) min/week for the first 3 months and 66 (13, 259) min/week for the last 3 months. No recordings of physical activity were done for the control group. Aerobic fitness (VO2 peak) increased in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. No effects were found on other cardio-metabolic outcomes or prostate cancer progression.  Conclusions:   The lifestyle intervention appeared feasible for 6 months among Danish men and the results are encouraging for conducting full-scale studies, where the impact of whole-grain rye and vigorous physical activity on prostate cancer progression and metabolic parameters can be evaluated.

Mutual information (MI) is a widely used similarity criterion in MR-TRUS image registration. However, the use of MI has been challenged because of intensity distortion, noise and down-sampling. Hence, we need to improve the MI measure to get better registration effect.  Methods:   We present a novel two-dimensional non-rigid MR-TRUS registration algorithm that uses correlation ratio-based mutual information (CRMI) as the similarity criterion. CRMI includes a functional mapping of intensity values on the basis of a generalized version of intensity class correspondence. We also analytically acquire the derivative of CRMI with respect to deformation parameters. Furthermore, we propose an improved stochastic gradient descent (ISGD) optimization method based on the Metropolis acceptance criteria to improve the global optimization ability and decrease the registration time.  Results:   The performance of the proposed method is tested on synthetic images and 12 pairs of clinical prostate TRUS and MR images. By comparing label map registration frame (LMRF) and conditional mutual information (CMI), the proposed algorithm has a significant improvement in the average values of Hausdorff distance and target registration error. Although the average Dice Similarity coefficient is not significantly better than CMI, it still has a crucial increase over LMRF. The average computation time consumed by the proposed method is similar to LMRF, which is 16 times less than CMI.  Conclusion:   With more accurate matching performance and lower sensitivity to noise and down-sampling, the proposed algorithm of minimizing CRMI by ISGD is more robust and has the potential for use in aligning TRUS and MR images for needle biopsy.""","""['Lun Gong', 'Haifeng Wang', 'Chengtao Peng', 'Yakang Dai', 'Min Ding', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Xiaodong Yang', 'Jian Zheng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Eng Online""","""['Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', '2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'Technique for a hybrid system of real-time transrectal ultrasound with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the guidance of targeted prostate biopsy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep learning in medical image registration: a review.', 'A consistency evaluation of signal-to-noise ratio in the quality assessment of human brain magnetic resonance images.']"""

Methods:   During July 2013 and September 2015, 251 patients with at least one suspicious lesion on mpMRI (rated by PI-RADS) were included into the analysis. All patients underwent MRI/US targeted biopsy (TB) in combination with a 10 core systematic prostate biopsy (SB). All biopsies were performed on a sensor-based fusion system. Group A included 162 men who received TB by an axial MRI/US image fusion. Group B comprised 89 men in whom the TB was performed with an additional sagittal image fusion.  Results:   The median age in group A was 67 years (IQR 61-72) and in group B 68 years (IQR 60-71). The median PSA level in group A was 8.10 ng/ml (IQR 6.05-14) and in group B 8.59 ng/ml (IQR 5.65-12.32). In group A the proportion of patients with a suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) (14 vs. 29%, p = 0.007) and the proportion of primary biopsies (33 vs 46%, p = 0.046) were significantly lower.

A phase II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy with real-time motion management and daily plan re-optimization for low to intermediate risk prostate cancer was undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis. This report details the toxicity and quality of life following treatment.  Methods:   From 2009 to 2013, 60 patients with T1-T2c prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 and PSA â¤ 15 or Gleason score of 7 and PSA â¤ 10 were enrolled. Patients with nodal metastases, an American Urological Association symptom score > 18, or gland size > 100 g were not eligible. Patients were treated to 37 Gy in 5 fractions. Early and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were graded based on NCI CTCAE v4.0 and quality of life was assessed by the American Urological Association symptom score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite Short Form up to 36 months after treatment.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 27.6 months, no grade 3 or greater genitourinary toxicity was observed. Four patients (6.7%) reported a late grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. One patient (1.7%) reported a late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. Five patients (8.3%) developed a late grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. The median American Urological Association symptom score increased from 4.5 prior to treatment to 11 while on treatment (p < 0.01), but was 5 at 36 months post-treatment (p = 0.65). Median International Index of Erectile Function scores decreased from 19 to 17 over the course of follow-up (p < 0.01). Only median scores within the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form sexual domain were significantly decreased at 36 months post-treatment (67.9 vs 45.2, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in median score within the urinary, bowel, or hormonal domains at 36 months of follow-up.  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy for low to intermediate risk prostate cancer is well tolerated with limited toxicity or decrease in quality of life.

Although prostate cancer initially presents as a non life-threatening disease, 90% of patients will develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which preludes distant metastasis and is largely accountable for prostate cancer associated deaths. This is because as yet, there are no viable molecular therapeutic targets for effective treatment of CRPC. It is now widely accepted that cancer cells can alter their metabolic profile during the course of tumourgenesis and metastasis such that they are able to survive in oxygen and nutrient-poor environments. This work was aimed towards gaining greater mechanistic understanding of how such 'stresses' in the tumour microenvironment impact on both androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen independent (LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-abl-Hof) prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have applied technically robust and reproducible label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis for comprehensive proteomic profiling of prostate cancer cell lines under nutrient deficient (low glucose) conditions. This led to the identification of approximately 4,000 proteins - one of the largest protein datasets for prostate cancer cell lines established to date. The biological and clinical significance of proteins showing a significant change in expression as result of low glucose conditions was established. Novel, intuitive workflows were subsequently implemented to ensure the verification of selected proteins of interest in a robust, reproducible and high throughput manner. Overall, these data suggest that this strategy supports identification of protein biomarkers of prostate cancer progression and potential therapeutic targets for CRPC.""","""['Claire Tonry', 'John Armstrong', 'Stephen R Pennington']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Probing the prostate tumour microenvironment II: Impact of hypoxia on a cell model of prostate cancer progression.', 'Quantitative proteomics reveals that enzymes of the ketogenic pathway are associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Amplification of MUC1 in prostate cancer metastasis and CRPC development.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'Clinical proteomics for prostate cancer: understanding prostate cancer pathology and protein biomarkers for improved disease management.', 'RNA-binding protein DDX3 mediates posttranscriptional regulation of androgen receptor: A mechanism of castration resistance.', 'SCREENED: A Multistage Model of Thyroid Gland Function for Screening Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in a Biologically Sex-Specific Manner.', 'A comparison of prostate cancer cell transcriptomes in 2D monoculture vs 3D xenografts identify consistent gene expression alterations associated with tumor microenvironments.', 'Shmt2: A Stat3 Signaling New Player in Prostate Cancer Energy Metabolism.']"""

MATERIAL AND METHODS EFEMP1 expression in serum and urine of patients with PCa, benign controls and healthy controls at mRNA and protein level were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, respectively. The chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between EFEMP1 expression and clinical factors of patients with PCa. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to evaluate the potential values of EFEMP1 for the diagnosis of PCa. RESULTS The relative expression of EFEMP1 was significantly decreased in patients with PCa compared with that in the benign controls and healthy individuals, both at mRNA and protein levels (P<0.05). In the postoperative serum, the EFEMP1 expression was significantly higher than that in preoperative serum at 2 levels. Urine EFEMP1 expression was also down-regulated in patients with PCa compared to that in the other 2 control groups. The low expression of EFEMP1 was obviously affected by Gleason's score, serum PSA, pathological stage, and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation between EFEMP1 expression and PSA levels. The ROC curve revealed that EFEMP1 distinguished PCa patients from healthy controls, with a high AUC of 0.908, corresponding with high sensitivity and specificity, which was significantly higher than the PSA value. CONCLUSIONS Serum EFEMP1 is down-regulated and involved in the progression of PCa.

We studied the National Cancer Data Base to determine whether the timing of ADT impacts survival.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to a dose of 70-81 Gy along with ADT from 2004-2011 were included. Those who started ADT 42-90 days before EBRT were identified as having received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (N-HT) and those who received ADT from 14 days before their radiation until 84 days after the start of EBRT were categorized as receiving concurrent/adjuvant treatment (C-HT). We used the log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression to assess the impact of covariables on overall survival (OS).  Results:   Among 11,491 included patients, those receiving N-HT were 1 year older (p<0.001) and more likely to have Gleason 8-10 disease (p = 0.01) and cT3-4 disease (p = 0.002). Men receiving N-HT had a 5-year and median OS of 80.6% and 111.4 months, respectively, compared to 78.3% and 108.9 months, respectively, in those receiving C-HT (p = 0.03). This benefit remained significant on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.96, p = 0.008). Duration of ADT was not available to report.  Conclusions:   External beam radiation therapy with N-HT was associated with improved overall survival compared to C-HT.

However, most studies have evaluated the efficacy of this treatment in women and report short-term results. In this study, we evaluated the long-term compliance of BoNT-A in a heterogeneous group of male patients.  Materials and methods:   This is a retrospective, single-centre study. We evaluated all male patients who have been treated with BoNT-A from 2004 until 2010 in a large teaching hospital. Patients received 100-300 U of onabotulinum toxin-A in 20 intravescial injections. Some patients received dose adjustment with repeated injections.  Results:   In total, 88 male patients were included. The mean follow-up was almost 6 years (69 months). Of all patients, 22 (25%) continued BoNT-A treatment at last follow-up (success). Of the patients who discontinued treatment, 35 had insufficient effect and 27 had tolerability issues (eg, urinary retention, self-catheterisation, voiding LUTS). Four patients abandoned treatment due to other reasons that were not related to BoNT-A. Of all patients, 24% had to use intermittent catheterisation (de novo) or indwelling catheters at some point during the follow-up.  Discussion:   In this real-life, heterogeneous cohort of men, the long-term compliance with BoNT-A was 25%. Patients with neurogenic OAB symptoms appear to have the best results in our study with 36% of patients who were still on active treatment during last follow-up. Intravesical BoNT-A can be an effective treatment for men with OAB symptoms. In our study, only 25% of patients continued treatment during long-term follow-up.

To this end, zinc(II) macrocycle coordination complexes with cyclic polyamine units as low-molecular-weight annexin mimics have a selective affinity for biomembrane surfaces enriched with PS, and are therefore useful for detection of cell death. In the present study, a 11C-labeled zinc(II)-bis(cyclen) complex (11C-CyclenZn2) was prepared and evaluated as a new positron emission tomography (PET) probe for cell death imaging. 11C-CyclenZn2 was synthesized by methylation of its precursor, 4-methoxy-2,5-di-[10-methyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tricarboxylic acid tri-tert-butyl ester] phenol (Boc-Cyclen2) with 11C-methyl triflate as a prosthetic group in acetone, deprotection by hydrolysis in aqueous HCl solution, and chelation with zinc nitrate. The cell death imaging capability of 11C-CyclenZn2 was evaluated using in vitro cell uptake assays with camptothecin-treated PC-3 cells, biodistribution studies, and in vivo PET imaging in Kunming mice bearing S-180 fibrosarcoma. Starting from 11C-methyl triflate, the total preparation time for 11C-CyclenZn2 was ~40 min, with an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 12 Â± 3% (based on 11C-CH3OTf, n = 10), a radiochemical purity of greater than 95%, and the specific activity of 0.75-1.01 GBq/Î¼mol. The cell death binding specificity of 11C-CyclenZn2 was demonstrated by significantly different uptake rates in camptothecin-treated and control PC-3 cells in vitro. Inhibition experiments for 18F-radiofluorinated Annexin V binding to apoptotic/necrotic cells illustrated the necessity of zinc ions for zinc(II)-bis(cyclen) complexation in binding cell death, and zinc(II)-bis(cyclen) complexe and Annexin V had not identical binding pattern with apoptosis/necrosis cells. Biodistribution studies of 11C-CyclenZn2 revealed a fast clearance from blood, low uptake rates in brain and muscle tissue, and high uptake rates in liver and kidney, which provide the main metabolic route. PET imaging using 11C-CyclenZn2 revealed that cyclophosphamide-treated mice (CP-treated group) exhibited a significant increase of uptake rate in the tumor at 60 min postinjection, compared with control mice (Control group). The results indicate that the ability of 11C-CyclenZn2 to detect cell death is comparable to Annexin V, and it has potential as a PET tracer for noninvasive evaluation and monitoring of anti-tumor chemotherapy.""","""['Hongliang Wang', 'Zhifang Wu', 'Sijin Li', 'Kongzhen Hu', 'Ganghua Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Noninvasive positron emission tomography imaging of cell death using a novel small-molecule probe, (18)F labeled bis(zinc(II)-dipicolylamine) complex.', 'Zn(II)-bis(cyclen) complexes and the imaging of apoptosis/necrosis.', 'Radiopharmacological evaluation of (18)F-labeled phosphatidylserine-binding peptides for molecular imaging of apoptosis.', 'Targeting phosphatidylserine for radionuclide-based molecular imaging of apoptosis.', 'Cy7-Bis-dipicolylamine-zinc.', 'Apoptosis Imaging in Oncology by Means of Positron Emission Tomography: A Review.', 'Synthesis of Organosilicon Ligands for Europium (III) and Gadolinium (III) as Potential Imaging Agents.', 'Rational design of caspase-responsive smart molecular probe for positron emission tomography imaging of drug-induced apoptosis.', 'The role of radionuclide probes for monitoring anti-tumor drugs efficacy: A brief review.']"""

Moreover, APA also helps in re-prioritization of APA shortlisted altered pathways enriched with context-specific genes. We performed APA analysis of simulated datasets and p53 status NCI-60 cell line microarray data to demonstrate potential of APA for identification of several case-specific altered pathways. APA analysis reveals several altered pathways not detected by other tools evaluated by us. APA analysis of unrelated prostate cancer datasets identifies sample-specific as well as conserved altered biological processes, mainly associated with lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation and proliferation.

The antidiabetic drug metformin may reduce the risk. This study evaluated PCa incidence among users of metformin and other antidiabetic drugs in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC).  Methods:   The study population (78,615 men) was linked to the national prescription database. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PCa were estimated using Cox regression, with medication use as a time-dependent variable. The effect of diabetes was estimated by comparing antidiabetic drug users to non-users, while drug-specific effects were evaluated within antidiabetic drug users. Analyses were performed in both study arms of FinRSPC.  Results:   Compared to non-users, men using antidiabetic drugs had lowered overall PCa risk (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92), and this association was not affected by PCa screening. However, the risk of metastatic PCa was increased (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.91). Among antidiabetic drug users, metformin decreased overall PCa risk (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95) in a dose-dependent manner. When stratified by FinRSPC study arm, the risk reduction was observed only in the screening arm. Sulphonylureas increased the risk of metastatic PCa (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.11-3.77). Use of thiazoledenediones or insulin was not associated with PCa risk.  Conclusion:   Among antidiabetic drug users, metformin lowered the overall PCa risk, while the risk of metastatic disease was elevated in sulphonylurea users. As sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion, the results suggest that hyperinsulinemia may be a risk factor for PCa.""","""['Antti Haring', 'Teemu J Murtola', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Metformin use and prostate cancer risk.', 'Outcomes of prostate cancer screening among men using antidiabetic medication.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'The influence of antidiabetic medications on the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'New insights into antidiabetic drugs: Possible applications in cancer treatment.', 'Genetically proxied glucose-lowering drug target perturbation and risk of cancer: a Mendelian randomisation analysis.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Immunomodulatory and Antiaging Mechanisms of Resveratrol, Rapamycin, and Metformin: Focus on mTOR and AMPK Signaling Networks.', 'Type 2 Diabetes-Related Variants Influence the Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Case-Control Study and Meta-Analysis.', 'Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study.']"""

We examined the effect of treatment delay (the time from diagnosis to date of first treatment) on survival using Cox and competing risks regression and compared quartiles of delay across the cohort. Adjustment was made for age, PSA levels, treatment modality and Gleason score. Outcomes included overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   Quartiles of delay were as follows (days)-Q1: 35, Q2: 86, Q3: 138.0, Q4: 264. Shorter delays were associated with hormonal treatment, high Gleason score and high PSA values. Measuring PCSM with Q2 as reference, age-adjusted associations were-Q1: sHR 4.37 (2.75-6.94), Q3: sHR 1.29 (0.73-2.28), Q4: sHR 1.55 (0.91-2.63). After additional adjustment for treatment type, Gleason score and PSA, Q1 remained at increased risk [sHR 2.46 (1.10-5.54)]. A similar trend was observed for OS. In analysis stratified by Gleason score, delays were not significantly associated with OS.  Conclusions:   Factors associated with shorter delay in treatment include high Gleason score, high PSA and hormonal treatment. After adjustment for these variables, increased delays were not associated with OS or PCSM in this cohort.

It is developing quickly in the field of cancer therapy. For example, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genetic testing demonstrates its efficiency for precision medicine in colorectal cancer (CRC). Besides for these well-known mutations, the purpose of performing larger genetic testing in this pathology is unknown. Recent reports have shown that using the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in patients with homologous repair enzyme deficiency gave positive clinical results in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. We have reported here the cases of 2 patients with multi-treated metastatic CRC who underwent somatic and constitutional exome analyses. The analyses revealed a loss of function mutation in a homologous repair enzyme resulting in the loss of heterozygosity for both patients (Check2 for the first patient and RAD51C for the second one). Both patients were treated with off-label usage of olaparib. While the first patient showed clinical benefit, reduction of carcinoembryonic antigen tumor marker and radiologic response, the second patient quickly presented a progression of the tumor. Additional genetic analyses revealed a frameshift truncating mutation of the TP53BP1 gene in the patient who progressed.

Methods:   All abdominal CT scans performed at NorthShore University HealthSystem showing mesenteric panniculitis from January 2005 to August 2010 were identified in the Radnet (RadNet Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) database. Patients with a new or known diagnosis of a malignancy were included for this analysis. Longitudinal clinical histories were obtained from electronic medical records.  Results:   In total, 147794 abdominal CT scans were performed during the study period. Three hundred and fifty-nine patients had mesenteric panniculitis (MP)-like abnormalities on their abdominal CT. Of these patients, 81 patients (22.6%) had a known history of cancer at the time of their CT scan. Nineteen (5.3%) had a new diagnosis of cancer in concurrence with their CT, but the majority of these (14/19, 74%) were undergoing CT as part of a malignancy evaluation. Lymphomas were the most common cancers associated with MP-like findings on CT (36 cases, 36%), with follicular lymphoma being the most frequent subtype (17/36). A variety of solid tumors, most commonly prostate (7) and renal cell cancers (6) also were seen. CT follow up was obtained in 56 patients. Findings in the mesentery were unchanged in 45 (80%), worsened in 6 (11%), and improved in 5 patients (9%). Positron emission tomography (PET) scans performed in 44 patients only showed a positive uptake in the mesenteric mass in 2 patients (5%).  Conclusion:   A new diagnosis of cancer is uncommon in patients with CT findings suggestive of MP. MP-like mesenteric abnormalities on CT generally remain stable in patients with associated malignancies.

The aim of this work was to optimize labeling of 68Ga-PSMAHBED using the efficient cation-exchange postprocessing of 68Ga as well as the development of a thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-based quality control system. Methods: Labeling was optimized for online ethanol-postprocessed 68Ga eluate investigating various parameters, such as buffer molarity (0.1-1 M), temperature (25Â°C-90Â°C), tracer amount (0.11-0.74 nmol), and labeling time. In addition, purification of the crude product was tested. For radio-TLC quality control, various mobile phases were analyzed using silica gel 60 plates and the results were validated using high-performance liquid chromatography. The most superior mobile phases were also applied on instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) silica gel plates. Results: Using optimized conditions, labeling yields of more than 95% were obtained within 10 min when ethanol-based postprocessing was applied using PSMAHBED amounts as low as 0.1 nmol. A higher precursor concentration (0.7 nmol) further increased labeling and quantitative yields to more than 98% within 5 min. In clinical routine, patient batches (>200 applications) with radiochemical purity greater than 98% and specific activities of 326 Â± 20 MBq/nmol are obtained reproducibly. When TLC quality control was performed on silica gel 60 plates, 4 mobile phases with suitable separation properties and complementary Rf values were identified. Two systems showed equivalent separation on ITLC silica gel plates, with ITLC analysis finished within 5 min, in contrast to 20 min for the TLC system. Labeling of PSMAHBED was optimized for cation-exchange postprocessing methods, ensuring almost quantitative labeling and high nuclide purity of final 68Ga-PSMAHBED, making subsequent purification steps unnecessary. Conclusion: The new radio-TLC method allows quality control in a short time using a fast, reliable, low-cost method with little equipment complexity.

PC has a propensity to be multifocal with several different cancerous foci per gland.  Results:   Here, we have taken advantage of the multifocal propensity of PC and categorized aggressiveness of individual PC foci based on DNA methylation patterns in primary PC foci and matched lymph node metastases. In a set of 14 patients, we demonstrate that over half of the cases have multiple epigenetically distinct subclones and determine the primary subclone from which the metastatic lesion(s) originated. Furthermore, we develop an aggressiveness classifier consisting of 25 DNA methylation probes to determine aggressive and non-aggressive subclones. Upon validation of the classifier in an independent cohort, the predicted aggressive tumors are significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases and invasive tumor stages.

We have previously generated a metabolically superior to gemcitabine molecule (GSG) by conjugating gemcitabine to a gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) ligand peptide and showed that GSG was efficacious in a castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) animal model. The current article provides an in-depth metabolic and mechanistic study of GSG, coupled with toxicity assays that strengthen the potential role of GSG in the clinic. LC-MS/MS based approaches were employed to delineate the metabolism of GSG, its mechanistic cellular uptake, and release of gemcitabine and to quantitate the intracellular levels of gemcitabine and its metabolites (active dFdCTP and inactive dFdU) resulting from GSG. The GnRH-R agonistic potential of GSG was investigated by quantifying the testosterone levels in animals dosed daily with GSG, while an in vitro colony forming assay together with in vivo whole blood measurements were performed to elucidate the hematotoxicity profile of GSG. Stability showed that the major metabolite of GSG is a more stable nonapeptide that could prolong gemcitabine's bioavailability. GSG acted as a prodrug and offered a metabolic advantage compared to gemcitabine by generating higher and steadier levels of dFdCTP/dFdU ratio, while intracellular release of gemcitabine from GSG in DU145 CRPC cells depended on nucleoside transporters. Daily administrations in mice showed that GSG is a potent GnRH-R agonist that can also cause testosterone ablation without any observed hematotoxicity. In summary, GSG could offer a powerful and unique pharmacological approach to prostate cancer treatment: a single nontoxic molecule that can be used to reach the tumor site selectively with superior to gemcitabine metabolism, biodistribution, and safety while also agonistically ablating testosterone levels.""","""['Theodoros Karampelas', 'Eleni Skavatsou', 'Orestis Argyros', 'Demosthenes Fokas', 'Constantin Tamvakopoulos']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['GnRH-Gemcitabine conjugates for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer: pharmacokinetic enhancements combined with targeted drug delivery.', 'Development of programmable gemcitabine-GnRH pro-drugs bearing linker controllable ""click"" oxime bond tethers and preclinical evaluation against prostate cancer.', 'Development of bioactive gemcitabine-D-Lys6-GnRH prodrugs with linker-controllable drug release rate and enhanced biopharmaceutical profile.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.', ""Pharmacological factors affecting accumulation of gemcitabine's active metabolite, gemcitabine triphosphate."", 'Laser-Induced Forward Transfer Printing on Microneedles for Transdermal Delivery of Gemcitabine.', 'Two Possible Strategies for Drug Modification of Gemcitabine and Future Contributions to Personalized Medicine.', 'Gemcitabine Peptide-Based Conjugates and Their Application in Targeted Tumor Therapy.', 'Targeted Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Gemcitabine-Incorporated GPC3 Aptamer.', 'Peptide Conjugates with Small Molecules Designed to Enhance Efficacy and Safety.']"""

Methods:   A matched cohort study was performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database. In total, 34,473 patients ages 66 to 75 years were identified who were without significant comorbidity, were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, and received treatment treated with surgery or radiotherapy between 2004 and 2011. These patients were matched to a noncancer control cohort. The rates of all-cause mortality that occurred within the study period were compared. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify determinants associated with overall survival.  Results:   Of 34,473 patients who were included in the analysis, 21,740 (63%) received radiation therapy, and 12,733 (37%) underwent surgery. There was improved survival in patients who underwent surgery (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.38) and in those who received radiotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.75) compared with noncancer controls.

Warfarin belongs to the vitamin K antagonist class of anticoagulants, which inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). The vitamin K cycle is primarily known for its role in Î³-carboxylation, a rare post-translational modification important in blood coagulation. Here we show that warfarin inhibits the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR), an important driver of prostate cancer development and progression. Warfarin treatment or knockdown of its target VKOR inhibits the activity of AR both in cell lines and in mouse prostate tissue. We demonstrate that AR can be Î³-carboxylated, and mapped the Î³-carboxylation to glutamate residue 2 (E2) using mass spectrometry. However, mutation of E2 and other glutamates on AR failed to suppress the effects of warfarin on AR suggesting that inhibition of AR is Î³-carboxylation independent. To identify pathways upstream of AR signaling that are affected by warfarin, we performed RNA-seq on prostates of warfarin-treated mice. We found that warfarin inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) signaling, which in turn, inhibited AR signaling. Although warfarin is unfit for use as a chemopreventative due to its anticoagulatory effects, our data suggest that its ability to reduce prostate cancer risk is independent of its anticoagulation properties. Furthermore, our data show that warfarin inhibits PPARÎ³ and AR signaling, which suggests that inhibition of these pathways could be used to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer.""","""['Ben Yi Tew', 'Teresa B Hong', 'Maya Otto-Duessel', 'Catherine Elix', 'Egbert Castro', 'Miaoling He', 'Xiwei Wu', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Markus Kalkum', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Vitamin K epoxide reductase expression and prostate cancer risk.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma controls prostate cancer cell growth through AR-dependent and independent mechanisms.', 'A new cell culture-based assay quantifies vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 function and reveals warfarin resistance phenotypes not shown by the dithiothreitol-driven VKOR assay.', 'VKORC1L1, An Enzyme Mediating the Effect of Vitamin K in Liver and Extrahepatic Tissues.', 'Structural and functional insights into human vitamin K epoxide reductase and vitamin K epoxide reductase-like1.', 'Sarcopenia in chronic kidney disease: from bench to bedside.', 'The role of PPARÎ³ in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Molecular Modeling of Allosteric Site of Isoform-Specific Inhibition of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor PPARÎ³.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Mapping Mechanistic Pathways of Acute Oral Systemic Toxicity Using Chemical Structure and Bioactivity Measurements.']"""

Compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, we confirmed that PCa tissues had high expression of CR-1 by immunohistochemistry and statistical data showed that CR-1 promoted properties of EMT in PCa tissues, including the downregulation of the cell adhesion molecules Î²-catenin (membrane) and E-cadherin while upregulating transcription factors Î²-catenin.

Warburg effect is an important characteristic of tumor cell metabolism including prostate cancer cells, in which hexokinase 2 (HK2), a major rate-limiting enzyme involved in Warburg effect, is selectively upregulated. The lectin PCL is a mannose binding lectin which induces tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy. In the present study, we report that PCL could lower glucose consumption and lactate production, shift the Warburg effect by inhibiting the expression of HK2 in PC3 cells and the suppression of HK2 by siRNA reversed the effect of PCL on glucose consumption and lactate production. The expression of HK2 is closely related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling pathway activation, therefore, we investigated the interaction of PCL with EGFR by western blot analysis and found that PCL could suppress the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with EGFR and HK2 expression. Also, we explored the binding mechanism between the PCL and EGFR through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations and found that PCL bocked the active site of EGFR which is also the binding site of the nature ligand EGF, the resulting conformation has higher stability than EGF in complex with EGFR. The results indicated that PCL could competitively bind to EGFR binding pocket and then prevent EGF from binding to EGFR, blocking the autophosphorylation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, after that the EGFR activation is inhibited. Collectively, our studies concluded that PCL inhibits tumor cell glycolysis by combining with EGFR and reducing HK2 expression.""","""['Hong Zhang', 'Xia Du', 'Ting-Ting Sun', 'Chun-Liu Wang', 'Ye Li', 'Shou-Zhen Wu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Involvement of EZH2 in aerobic glycolysis of prostate cancer through miR-181b/HK2 axis.', 'Ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3 Inhibits the Warburg Effect Via Modulating DNMT3A/ MiR-532-3p/HK2 Pathway in Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Butein Inhibited In Vitro Hexokinase-2-Mediated Tumor Glycolysis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Blocking Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).', 'Polygonatum cyrtonema lectin, a potential antineoplastic drug targeting programmed cell death pathways.', 'A Tumor Agnostic Therapeutic Strategy for Hexokinase 1-Null/Hexokinase 2-Positive Cancers.', 'Targeting the Interplay between Cancer Metabolic Reprogramming and Cell Death Pathways as a Viable Therapeutic Path.', 'PKCÎ´-mediated SGLT1 upregulation confers the acquired resistance of NSCLC to EGFR TKIs.', 'Aldolase A Enhances Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Proliferation and Invasion through Promoting Glycolysis.', 'HK2 is associated with the Warburg effect and proliferation in\xa0liver cancer: Targets for effective therapy with glycyrrhizin.', 'TGF-b1 or hypoxia enhance glucose metabolism and lactate production via HIF1A signaling in tendon cells.']"""

Objective:   To ascertain and compare the performance of 4 candidate surrogates (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] failure, PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL, PSA doubling time <9 months, and interval to PSA failure <30 months) for all-cause mortality using the proportion of treatment-effect metric.  Design, setting, and participants:   For this randomized clinical trial, 206 men with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer who were seen at a Harvard-affiliated academic hospital or an associated community hospital between December 1, 1995, to April 15, 2001, were identified, randomized to radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy followed by 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy, and followed for a median 16.62 years. This analysis looks at the subgroup of 157 men with minimal comorbidities or no comorbidity (median follow-up, 16.49 months).  Interventions:   Patients were previously randomized to receive radiation therapy or radiation and 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk of all-cause mortality.  Results:   Overall, a cohort of 157 men (median [interquartile range] age, 72.43 [68.75-75.53]) with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer and minimal or no comorbidities were selected for this study. Three tested metrics met all 4 Prentice criteria for surrogacy for the surrogate covariate in the adjusted model for all-cause mortality: PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.17-2.52; P = .01), PSA doubling time less than 9 months (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.29-3.28; P = .003), and interval to PSA failure less than 30 months (aHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.92; P = .03); while PSA failure did not. For the 3 successful surrogates, the proportion of treatment effect values were 103.86%, 43.09%, and 41.26%, respectively.  Conclusions and relevance:   A PSA nadir value of greater than 0.5 ng/mL following radiation and androgen deprivation therapy appears to identify men prior to PSA failure who are at high-risk for death. This could be used to select men for entry at the time of PSA nadir onto randomized trials evaluating the impact on survival of salvage androgen deprivation therapy with or without agents shown to prolong survival in men with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   A total of 157 patients with high-risk prostate cancer (based on D'Amico's criteria) were included in the analysis. Patients underwent preoperative 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging within 2 months before radical prostatectomy. Those who received neoadjuvant hormone therapy (33 persons) or radiation therapy (18 persons) were excluded. The ADC of the tumor calculated from 2 b-values (0 and 1,000 s/mm2) was measured. Areas under receiver operating characteristics curves were calculated to maximize the accuracy of the ADC value. Based on the obtained cutoff value, the patients were stratified into 2 groups: Group A consisted of patients with ADC values <746Ã10-6 mm2/s and group B comprised those with ADC values â¥746Ã10-6 mm2/s.  Results:   Group A showed higher rate of lymph positive and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates than group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the BCR-free survival rate of group A was much lower than that of group B (p<0.001). On Cox proportional regression analyses, ADC group A (hazard ratio [HR], 3.238, p=0.002) and pathologic lymph node positive (HR, 2.242; p=0.009) were independent predictors of BCR.  Conclusions:   In patients with high-risk prostate cancer, ADC value is significantly associated with BCR-free survival.

Triclosan (TCS), an antimicrobial agent widely used as a preservative in personal care products, has been shown to act as an endocrine disruptor in hormone-dependent tissues. Here, we demonstrate a new molecular mechanism by which TCS stimulates the secretion by human prostate cancer stromal cells of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a factor known to promote tumor growth. This mechanism involves an increase in intracellular calcium levels due to the direct activation of a membrane ion channel. Using calcium imaging and electrophysiology techniques, we show for the first time that environmentally relevant concentrations of TCS activate a cation channel of the TRP family, TRPA1 (Transient Receptor Potential Ankirin 1), in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells. The TCS-induced TRPA1 activation increased basal calcium in stromal cells and stimulated the secretion of VEGF and epithelial cells proliferation. Interestingly, immunofluorescence labeling performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate tissues showed an exclusive expression of the TRPA1 channel in prostate cancer stromal cells.

We conducted a pooled nested case-control analysis in 3 cohorts (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Trial, Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, and Cancer Prevention Study-II), with 758 cases (435 current smokers) and 1,052 controls (531 smokers) matched by cohort, age, sex, race, blood draw date and follow-up time. We used conditional logistic regression adjusted for age, smoking, diabetes, and body mass index to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Circulating C-peptide concentration was not associated with PDA in never or former smokers, but was inversely associated with PDA in current smokers (per SD OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.84; Pinteraction = 0.005). HMW adiponectin was inversely associated with PDA in never smokers (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.81), not associated in former smokers, and positively associated in smokers (OR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.45; Pinteraction = 0.009).

Radiotherapy carries unique long-term toxicity risks for cancer survivors. This study describes the current estimates and future projections of the epidemiology of 5-year cancer survivors who receive radiation therapy.Methods: We used cancer incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) database linked to U.S. Census data to estimate the number of 5-year cancer survivors treated with radiation between 2000 and 2030. Future projections assumed continuing incidence and survival trends based on historical rates.Results: In 2016, there were an estimated 3.05 million cancer survivors treated with radiation, accounting for 29% of all cancer survivors. The number of radiation-treated cancer survivors is projected to reach 3.38 million by 2020 and 4.17 million by 2030. In 2016, breast (40%) and prostate cancer (23%) composed the majority of radiation-treated survivors, followed by head and neck cancer (5.8%), lymphoma (5.6%), uterine (3.9%), and rectal cancer (3.8%).

In the late 1990s, new surgical and radiation technologies were introduced in combination with androgen deprivation. To evaluate respective strategies, outcomes were examined.  Patients and methods:   Between 2001 and 2010, 224 patients with T3N0M0 (10.9% of all prostate cancer cases) were treated with prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy with/without androgen deprivation or hormone alone. Complete records were obtained by the end of 2015.  Results:   Operation group first started without adjuvant treatment and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse occurred in 39% of cases. Radiation therapy group was alternatively divided into two subgroups, that received either monotherapy or combination with androgen deprivation, and PSA relapse rates were 65 and 16%, respectively. High rates of PSA relapse in both the operation and radiation therapy groups were observed in patients without adjuvant therapy, but after relapse androgen deprivation proceeded favorable outcomes. In the radiation subgroups, PSA relapse rates were different, but both subsequent survival rates were the same. This may be due to the effect of androgen deprivation after relapse, indicating effect of delayed therapy. PSA relapse rate in the hormone therapy group was 25% and after relapse, patients applied to treatment with other hormonal and anticancer drugs. Overall survival rates were 91, 88 and 67% in the operation, radiation therapy and hormone therapy groups, respectively.

Case presentation:   Out of 9504 patients with rectal tumors between January 2003 and January 2015, 9 patients (elderly with a mean age of 74 years) with prostate cancer involving the rectal wall were clinically misdiagnosed with rectal cancer. The lesions were located in the rectum, and included 3 circumferential rectal masses, 1 ulceration lesion, 1 crater-like mass, and 4 protruding lesions. Specimens were acquired using biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or resection. The initial symptoms of these patients included rectal urgency, bowel obstruction, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Prostate-related symptoms were not obvious. Histologically, 2 cases showed cancer cell invasion in the mucosa, 1 showed transmural invasion from the mucosa to subserosal soft tissues, and 7 cases had submucosa and muscularis propria involvement. All the 9 cases had muscularis propria involvement. However, there were no intraepithelial neoplasias in the mucosal layer, which is reminiscent of rectal carcinoma. The tumors consisted of small-sized or foamy cells that formed acinus-like, duct-like, and cribriform-like structures. We conducted histological staining and an immunohistochemical analysis for CDX-2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), P504s, villin, carcinoembryonic antigen, CK-pan, cytokeratin 20, and Ki-67. All tumors were PSA and CK-pan positive, 5 of 9 tumors were P504s-positive, and all tumors were negative for the other markers. All patients underwent standard therapy for prostate cancer after the definitive pathological diagnosis. As of March 31, 2015, 8 patients were alive and 1 had died of prostate cancer 6 months posttreatment.  Conclusions:   Adenocarcinoma appearing in the rectal wall is not always rectal carcinoma.

However, few data have focused on the oncological outcomes of LNU in the subgroup of localized and/or locally advanced UTUC (T1-4/N0-X). The purpose of this study was to compare the oncological outcomes of LNU vs. ONU for the treatment in patients with T1-4/N0-X UTUC.  Methods:   We collected and analyzed the data and clinical outcomes retrospectively for 265 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy for T1-4/N0-X UTUC between April 2000 and April 2013 at two Chinese tertiary hospitals. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox's proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   The mean patient age was 62.0 years and the median follow-up was 60.0 months. Of the 265 patients, 213 (80.4%) underwent conventional ONU, and 52 (19.6%) patients underwent LNU. The groups differed significantly in their presence of previous hydronephrosis, presence of previous bladder urothelial carcinoma, and management of distal ureter (P < 0.05). The predicted 5-year intravesical recurrence- free survival (RFS) (79% vs. 88%, P = 0.204), overall RFS (47% vs. 59%, P = 0.076), cancer-specific survival (CSS) (63% vs. 70%, P = 0.186), and overall survival (OS) (61% vs. 55%, P = 0.908) rates did not differ between the ONU and LNU groups. Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis showed that surgical approach was not significantly associated with intravesical RFS (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-3.65, P = 0.622), Overall RFS (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.54-1.83, P = 0.974), CSS (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.616-3.13, P = 0.444), or OS (OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.81-3.17, P = 0.17).

Expression of epithelial (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin, fibronectin) revealed that two of the four clones were incapable of spontaneously activating EMT, whereas the others contained large populations of EMT-derived, vimentin-positive cells having spindle-like morphology. One of the two EMT-positive clones exhibited aggressive and stem cell-like characteristics, whereas the other was non-aggressive and showed no stem cell phenotype. One of the two EMT-negative clones exhibited aggressive stem cell-like properties, whereas the other was the least aggressive of all clones.

While the introduction of widespread PSA testing has been associated with a downward stage migration, whether this trend continues in the late PSA era and for black men is unknown. The objective of our study was to evaluate current PC stage migration patterns in the United States by race.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry was queried to obtain all cases of PC reported between 2000 and 2013. Year of diagnosis was categorized into 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013. Predictors of distant stage PC at diagnosis were determined using logistic regression adjusted for year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, SEER region and race.  Results:   A total of 791 184 PC cases were identified. The cohort comprised 78.9% (n=594 920) white and 14.1% (n=106 133) black men. The stage at diagnosis was 83.3% localized, 12.0% regional and 4.7% distant. Age-adjusted incidence demonstrated a steady decline for black men in all time groups while white men had a stable incidence of distant disease between 2000 and 2013. In univariate analysis, black men in the 2004-2007 (OR 0.86 (0.81-0.93)) and 2008-2010 cohorts (OR 0.85 (0.79-0.91)) were less likely to be diagnosed with metastatic PC as compared with the 2000-2003 baseline cohort. In multivariate analysis, the 2004-2007 black cohort was less likely to be diagnosed with distant PC (OR 0.90 (0.84-0.97)). This trend was not observed in white men who in multivariate analysis had an increased risk of distant PC in the 2004-2007 (OR 1.08 (1.04-1.11)), 2008-2010 (OR 1.22 (1.18-1.27)) and 2011-2013 (OR 1.65 (1.59-1.71)) groups.

Methods:   Prostate cancer patients consecutively treated with definitive radiation at our institution by a single provider from 1993 to 2006 and who had an end-of-radiation (EOR) PSA (n=688, median follow-up 11.2 years). We analyzed the association of an EOR PSA level, obtained during the last week of radiation, with survival outcomes. Multivariable-adjusted cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess associations between a detectable EOR PSA (defined as â©¾0.1 ng ml-1) and biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed, with stratification by EOR PSA.  Results:   At the end of radiation, the PSA level was undetectable in 30% of patients. Men with a detectable EOR PSA experienced inferior 10-year BFFS (49.7% versus 64.4%, P<0.001), 10-year MFS (84.8% versus 92.0%, P=0.003), 10-year PCSS (94.3% versus 98.2%, P=0.007) and 10-year OS (75.8% versus 82.5%, P=0.01), as compared to men with an undetectable EOR PSA. Among National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) intermediate- and high-risk men who were treated with definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a detectable EOR PSA was more strongly associated with PCSS than initial NCCN risk level (EOR PSA: HR 5.89, 95% CI 2.37-14.65, P<0.001; NCCN risk level: HR 2.01, 95% CI 0.74-5.42, P=0.168). Main study limitations are retrospective study design and associated biases.  Conclusions:   EOR PSA was significantly associated with survival endpoints in men who received treatment with definitive radiation and ADT.

Repeat biopsy or MRI-guided biopsies have been suggested to increase sensitivity for diagnosis of prostate cancer, but the risk of disease-specific mortality in men who present with raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration and a benign initial biopsy result remains unknown. We investigated the risk of overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality in men with a benign initial biopsy set.  Methods:   Data were extracted from the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry-a population-based registry including all men undergoing histopathological assessment of prostate tissue. All men who were referred for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for assessment of suspected prostate cancer between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2011, in Denmark were eligible for inclusion. Follow-up data were obtained on April 28, 2015. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality, analysed in a competing risk setting, with death from other causes as the competing event.  Findings:   Between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2011, 64 430 men were referred for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, of whom 63 454 were eligible for inclusion. Median follow-up was 5Â·9 years (IQR 3Â·8-8Â·5) and the total follow-up time, from the enrolment of the first patient on Jan 1, 1995, until the extraction of causes of death on April 28, 2015, was 20 years. 10 407 (30%) of 35 159 men with malignant initial biopsy sets died from prostate cancer, compared with 541 (2%) of 27 181 men with benign initial biopsy sets. Estimated overall 20-year mortality was 76Â·1% (95% CI 73Â·0-79Â·2). In all men referred for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality after 20 years was 25Â·6% (24Â·7-26Â·5) versus 50Â·5% (47Â·5-53Â·5) for mortality from other causes. In men with benign initial biopsy sets, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 5Â·2% (3Â·9-6Â·5) versus 59Â·9% (55Â·2-64Â·6) for mortality from other causes. In men with PSA concentrations 10 Î¼g/L or lower and benign initial biopsy sets (2779 men), the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 0Â·7% (0Â·2-1Â·3). Cumulative incidence of prostate cancer specific mortality in men with benign initial biopsy sets was 3Â·6% (95% CI 0Â·1-7Â·2) for men with a PSA higher than 10 ng/mL but 20 ng/mL or less (855 men) and 17Â·6% (12Â·7-22Â·4) and for men with a PSA higher than 20 ng/mL (454 men).  Interpretation:   The first systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy set holds important prognostic information. The 20-year risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in men with benign initial results is low. Our findings question whether men with low PSA concentration and a benign initial biopsy set should undergo further diagnostic assessment in view of the high risk of mortality from other causes.

The aim of the present study was to investigate preoperative serum lipid levels in patients with clinically localized PCa undergoing RP and their association with clinicopathological features and oncological outcome.  Methods:   Preoperative lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides) and statin use from consecutive patients with clinically localized PCa undergoing RP in a tertiary referral center between 2008 and 2015 were recorded and patients were followed prospectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the association between lipid levels and clinicopathological parameters. Lipid values were analyzed both as continuous and dichotomized variables. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for recurrence-free survival (RFS). Recurrence was defined as rising and verified PSA levels >0.1 ng/ml.  Results:   Our cohort consisted of 371 men with a median age of 63 years (range 41-78 years) and a median preoperative PSA value of 6.79 ng/ml (0.43-81.4 ng/ml). Median follow-up was 28 months (1-64). No association was found between lipid levels and adverse pathological characteristics such as â¥pT3, Gleason score â¥8, positive nodal status and positive surgical margins. Recurrence occurred in 49 patients (15.4%) at a median time of 18 months (2-51 month).

Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we evaluated patterns of care and outcomes among patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer from 2004 to 2013 treated with local therapy (RP, intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT], or 2D/3D-conformal radiation therapy [CRT]). The association between local therapy, co-variates, and outcomes was assessed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and Propensity score (PS) matching was performed to balance confounding factors. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Among the 1,208,180 patients in the NCDB with prostate cancer, 6,051 patients met the inclusion criteria. No local therapy was used in 5,224 patients, while 622 (10.3%), 52 (0.9%), 153 (2.5%) patients received RP, IMRT, and 2D/3D-CRT, respectively. Use of local therapy was associated with younger age (â¤70), lower co-morbidity score, lower T-stage, Gleason score <8, node-negative status, private, and Medicare insurance, higher income quartile, and treatment at comprehensive or academic/research programs (P < 0.05). Five-year overall survival for patients receiving local therapy was 45.7% versus 17.1% for those not receiving local therapy (P < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, RP (HR = 0.51; 95%CI, 0.45-0.59, P < 0.01) and IMRT (HR = 0.47; 95%CI, 0.31-0.72, P < 0.01) were independently associated with superior overall survival. After PS-matching, the use of local therapy (RP or IMRT) remained significantly associated with overall survival (HR = 0.35; 95%CI, 0.30-0.41, P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The use of RP and IMRT, to treat the primary disease, was associated with improvements in overall survival for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We have identified patient-specific variations in the use of local therapy that may be tested in subsequent prospective clinical trials to improve patient outcomes in this setting.

We examined this and other thresholds, including nomogram validation.  Methods:   We examined records of 26,713 patients treated with RP and PLND between 2010 and 2013, within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Nomogram thresholds of 2-5% were tested and external validation was performed.  Results:   LNI was recorded in 4.7% of patients. Nomogram accuracy was 80.4% and maintained minimum accuracy of 75.6% in subgroup analyses, according to age, race, and nodal yield >10. With the NCCN recommended 2% nomogram threshold, PLND could be avoided in 22.3% of patients at the expense of missing 3.0% of individuals with LNI. Alternative thresholds of 3%, 4%, and 5% yielded respective PLND avoidance rates of 60.4%, 71.0%, and 79.8% at the expense of missing 17.8%, 27.2%, and 36.6% of patients with LNI. NCCN cut-off recommendation was best satisfied with a threshold of <2.6%, at which PLND could be avoided in 13,234 patients (49.5%) versus missing 141 patients with LNI (11.2%).  Conclusion:   NCCN LNI nomogram remains accurate in contemporary patients. However, the 2% threshold appears to be too strict, since only 22.3% of PLNDs can be avoided, instead of the stipulated 47.7%. The optimal 2.6% threshold allows a higher rate of PLND avoidance (49.5%), at the cost of 11.2% missed instances of LNI, as recommended by NCCN guidelines. PATIENT SUMMARY. External validation in contemporary SEER prostate cancer patients showed that the NCCN nomogram remains accurate for predicting lymph node invasion and seems to be optimal at an alternative 2.6% threshold, with best ratio of avoided pelvic lymph node dissections (49.5%) and missed LNIs (11.2%), as recommended by NCCN guideline.

A quantitative paper-based questionnaire was modified, adapted, and administered to participants from the Personal Integrative Model of Prostate Cancer Disparity Survey and the Powe Fatalism Inventory. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted and analyzed using thematic analysis. Of the 31 participants, 17 (55%) were CB black men and 14 (45%) were AA men. CB black men reported significantly higher mean perception of CaP treatment scores compared to AA men (8.23 versus 6.14, p < 0.05). Overall, the focus group and interview data revealed highly interrelated key themes. These themes included perceived barriers to CaP screening (e.g., health-care affordability), misconceptions about CaP (e.g., limited knowledge), and misinformation about CaP (e.g., conflicting CaP screening information from health-care providers). Feeling responsible to make sure family members were taken care of and the role of a significant other were reported as motivation for visiting the doctor. As a result of the CEMM design, a reliable survey instrument was developed to measure CaP fear and facilitators for screening behavior within subpopulations of AA men, which is important because despite their shared genetic ancestry, AA and CB black males may have very different lifestyles.""","""['Ewan K Cobran', 'Jori N Hall', 'William D Aiken']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Perceptions of prostate cancer fatalism and screening behavior between United States-born and Caribbean-born Black males.', 'An integrative review exploring black men of African and Caribbean backgrounds, their fears of prostate cancer and their attitudes towards screening.', 'Intrinsic religiousness as a mediator between fatalism and cancer-specific fear: clarifying the role of fear in prostate cancer screening.', 'Improvement of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs of African American Men Toward Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Prostate cancer screening behaviors among Indo-Guyanese.', 'An Exploration of Precancer and Post-Cancer Diagnosis and Health Communication Among African American Prostate Cancer Survivors and Their Families.', 'LXRs, SHP, and FXR in Prostate Cancer: Enemies or MÃ©nage Ã  Quatre With AR?', 'Comparison of Cancer Fatalism Among Rural Smokers and Nonsmokers.', 'Leveraging the Family Influence of Women in Prostate Cancer Efforts Targeting African American Men.']"""

The objective of this study was to present the current situation of cancer incidence in Spain.  Methods:   The Spanish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN) estimated the numbers of new cancer cases occurred in Spain in 2015 by applying the incidence-mortality ratios method. In the calculus, incidence data from population-based cancer registries and mortality data of all Spain were used.  Results:   In 2015, nearly a quarter of a million new invasive cancer cases were diagnosed in Spain, almost 149,000 in men (60.0%) and 99,000 in women. Globally, the five most common cancers were those of colon-rectum, prostate, lung, breast and urinary bladder. By gender, the four most common cancers in men were those of prostate (22.4%), colon-rectum (16.6%), lung (15.1%) and urinary bladder (11.7%). In women, the most common ones were those of breast (28.0%), colon-rectum (16.9%), corpus uteri (6.2%) and lung (6.0%). In recent years, cancer incidence in men seems to have stabilized due to the fact that the decrease in tobacco-related cancers compensates for the increase in other types of cancer like those of colon and prostate. In women, despite the stabilization of breast cancer incidence, increased incidence is due, above all, to the rise of colorectal and tobacco-related cancers.  Conclusion:   To reduce these incident cancer cases, improvement of smoking control policies and extension of colorectal cancer screening should be the two priorities in cancer prevention for the next years.""","""['J Galceran', 'A Ameijide', 'M Carulla', 'A Mateos', 'J R QuirÃ³s', 'D Rojas', 'A AlemÃ¡n', 'A Torrella', 'M Chico', 'M Vicente', 'J M DÃ­az', 'N LarraÃ±aga', 'R Marcos-Gragera', 'M J SÃ¡nchez', 'J Perucha', 'P Franch', 'C Navarro', 'E Ardanaz', 'J Bigorra', 'P Rodrigo', 'R Peris Bonet;REDECAN Working Group']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer survival in adult patients in Spain.

On the other hand, there are conflicting results that the AhR deficiency results in increased susceptibility to prostate tumors in mouse model. In the present study, we investigated AhR expression and its role in the growth and invasiveness of human prostate cancer cells. The AhR protein expression was detected in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer tissues. A small interfering RNA targeting AhR, constitutive active AhR expression vector, and AhR agonist and antagonist were used to moderate its expression and signaling. The induction of AhR signaling attenuated invasiveness of prostate cancer cells without affecting the cellular growth rate. These results suggest that AhR signaling in prostate cancer cells facilitates invasion of these cells, and modulation with this signaling can be a potential therapeutic target of invasive tumors.""","""['Hisamitsu Ide', 'Yan Lu', 'Jingsong Yu', 'Takahiro Noguchi', 'Mayuko Kanayama', 'Satoru Muto', 'Raizo Yamaguchi', 'Suguru Kawato', 'Shigeo Horie']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is constitutively active in advanced prostate cancer cells.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Suppresses the Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cell Growth and Invasion by Promoting DNA Damage Response Under Oxidative Stress.', 'Downregulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression decreases gastric cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'AHR signaling in prostate growth, morphogenesis, and disease.', 'Expression and activity of aryl hydrocarbon receptors in development and cancer.', 'When AHR signaling pathways meet viral infections.', 'The Kynurenine Pathway and Cancer: Why Keep It Simple When You Can Make It Complicated.', 'How the AHR Became Important in Cancer: The Role of Chronically Active AHR in Cancer Aggression.', 'Inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/polyamine biosynthesis axis suppresses multiple myeloma.']"""

Patient-centred functional outcomes, subjective evaluation of perioperative counselling, and patient satisfaction rates were documented. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was assessed by daily pad usage. Erectile dysfunction (ED) was assessed using IIEF5 score. Patients' histories were attained from the electronic medical records. The effect of pre-defined predictive features for satisfaction rates was analysed in low-risk patients.

Here, we report on the development of a new CD44-targeted copolymer carrying multiple copies of the A5G27 peptide, known for its ability to bind specifically to CD44v3 and CD44v6 on cancer cells and inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. We hypothesized that conjugation of A5G27 to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer would enhance tumor tissue accumulation, promote selective binding to cancer cells, with concomitant increased inhibition of cancer cell invasiveness and migration. Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate or the near-infrared fluorophore IR783 were attached to the copolymer backbone through a non-cleavable linkage to assess in vitro binding to cancer cells and biodistribution of the polymer in 4T1 murine mammary adenocarcinoma-bearing mice, respectively. The anti-migratory activity was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The binding of the targeted copolymer to cancer cells correlated well with the level of CD44 expression, with the polymer being internalized more efficiently by cancer cells. Pre-treatment of mice with polymer-bound A5G27 significantly inhibited lung colonization of migrating 4T1 cells in vivo, with the targeted copolymer accumulating preferentially in subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, when compared to a non-targeted system. As such, the HPMA copolymer-A5G27 conjugate is a promising candidate for inhibiting cancer cell migration and can also be used as a drug or imaging probe carrier for detection and treatment of cancer.""","""['Michal Zaiden', 'Valeria Feinshtein', 'Ayelet David']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['CD44-Targeted Polymer-Paclitaxel Conjugates to Control the Spread and Growth of Metastatic Tumors.', 'Inhibition of primary and metastatic tumors in mice by E-selectin-targeted polymer-drug conjugates.', 'Antiangiogenic antitumor activity of HPMA copolymer-paclitaxel-alendronate conjugate on breast cancer bone metastasis mouse model.', 'HPMA copolymer-cyclic RGD conjugates for tumor targeting.', 'Development of HPMA copolymer-anticancer conjugates: clinical experience and lessons learnt.', 'The clinical significance of CD44v6 in malignant and benign primary bone tumors.', 'Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecules- (un)Attainable Targets for Nanomedicines.', 'Specific and Aspecific Molecular Checkpoints as Potential Targets for Dismantling Tumor Hierarchy and Preventing Relapse and Metastasis Through Shielded Cytolytic Treatments.', 'Therapeutic delivery of microRNA-143 by cationic lipoplexes for non-small cell lung cancer treatment in vivo.', 'Similarities Between Embryo Development and Cancer Process Suggest New Strategies for Research and Therapy of Tumors: A New Point of View.']"""

The aim was to optimize the highest Gleason score detection.  Materials and methods:   A total of 327 patients with negative digital rectal examination underwent magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy for elevated/rising prostate specific antigen and/or 1 or more detectable lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging after a previous negative standard biopsy. Depending on the diameter of each index lesion (8 or less, or greater than 8 mm) 4 or 6 cores, respectively, were taken according to a well determined sequence.  Results:   Of the patients 166 (50.7%) had prostate cancer, including 79 (47.6%) with an 8 mm or less index lesion and 87 (52.4%) with a greater than 8 mm index lesion. Of patients with an index tumor 8 mm or less 7 (8.9%) had 1, 31 (39.2%) had 2, 27 (34.2%) had 3 and 14 (17.7%) had 4 positive cores.

Secondary outcomes from a RTC examining the effect of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program (RePCa) among radiated men with prostate cancer""","""Background:   The objective of this study was to examine if rehabilitation influenced self-reported male coping styles during and up to three years after treatment with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   In a single-center oncology unit in Odense, Denmark, 161 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy were included in a randomized controlled trial from 2010 to 2012. The trial examined the effect of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program within six months of treatment consisting of two nursing counseling sessions and two instructive sessions with a physical therapist (n = 79), or standard care (n = 82). As secondary outcomes coping was measured before radiotherapy, one month after radiotherapy (baseline), six month post-intervention (assessment) and three years after radiotherapy (follow-up) by the Mini-mental adjustment to cancer scale (Mini-MAC). The male coping styles towards the illness are expressed in five mental adjustment styles: Fighting Spirit, Helplessness-Hopelessness, Anxious Preoccupation, Fatalism and Cognitive Avoidance. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for the longitudinal design were conducted.  Results:   Most coping styles remained stable during the patient trajectory but Anxious Preoccupation declined from before radiotherapy to follow-up in both intervention and control groups. After six months the intervention group retained Fighting Spirit significantly (p = 0.025) compared with controls, but after three years this difference evened out. After three years the intervention group had lower Cognitive Avoidance (p = 0.044) than the controls. Factors as educational level, and depression influenced the use of coping styles after three years.  Conclusion:   Multidisciplinary rehabilitation in irradiated prostate cancer patients retained the adjustment style Fighting Spirit stable after six months of radiotherapy, and in the long term reduced Cognitive Avoidance. Thus, the rehabilitation program supported the patient's active coping style and played down the passive coping style.""","""['Karin B Dieperink', 'Christoffer Johansen', 'SteinbjÃ¸rn Hansen', 'Lis Wagner', 'Klaus K Andersen', 'Lisbeth R Minet', 'Olfred Hansen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Association of coping style, cognitive errors and cancer-related variables with depression in women treated for breast cancer.', 'The effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation: RePCa-a randomised study among primary prostate cancer patients.', 'The ADAPP trial: a two-year longitudinal multidisciplinary intervention study for prostate cancer frail patients on androgen deprivation associated to curative radiotherapy.', 'Influence of psychological coping on survival and recurrence in people with cancer: systematic review.', 'Coping with prostate cancer: a meta-analytic review.', 'Exercise interventions for adults with cancer receiving radiation therapy alone.', 'Study protocol of a prospective multicenter study comparing (cost-)effectiveness of a tailored interdisciplinary head and neck rehabilitation program to usual supportive care for patients treated with concomitant chemo- or bioradiotherapy.', 'Interventions for promoting habitual exercise in people living with and beyond cancer.', 'Examining trajectories of anxiety in men with prostate cancer faced with complex treatment decisions.']"""

It is stimulated by the androgens, or male sexual hormones, which circulate in the blood and diffuse into the tissue where they stimulate the prostate tumor to grow. One of the most important treatments for advanced prostate cancer has become androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In this paper we present three different models of ADT for prostate cancer: continuous androgen suppression (CAS), intermittent androgen suppression (IAS), and periodic androgen suppression. Currently, many patients in the U.S. receive CAS therapy of ADT, but many undergo a relapse after several years and experience adverse side effects while receiving treatment. Some clinical studies have introduced various IAS regimens in order to delay the time to relapse, and/or to reduce the economic costs and adverse side effects. We will compute and analyze parameter sensitivity analysis for CAS and IAS which may give insight to plan effective data collection in a future clinical trial. Moreover, a periodic model for IAS is used to develop an analytical formulation for relapse times which then provides information about the sensitivity of relapse to the parameters in our models.""","""['Alacia M Voth', 'John G Alford', 'Edward W Swim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Math Biosci Eng""","""['A new protocol for intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer with unstable saddle-point dynamics.', 'Personalizing Androgen Suppression for Prostate Cancer Using Mathematical Modeling.', 'A nonlinear competitive model of the prostate tumor growth under intermittent androgen suppression.', 'Intermittent versus continuous androgen suppression for prostatic cancer.', 'Intermittent androgen suppression for prostate cancer.', 'Using medical claims database to develop a population disease progression model for leuprorelin-treated subjects with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

Recent researches demonstrate that Magnolin inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion.  Materials and methods:   This study used cell culture and the BALB/c nu/nu mouse xenograft model to investigate whether or not magnolin can inhibit the growth of PC3 and Du145 prostate cancer cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed to estimate the proliferation, cycle, and apoptosis of the cells in vitro. Clone formation assay was also conducted. In the animal study, Ki-67 immunostaining and TUNEL assay were carried out to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. To elucidate the possible mechanism by which magnolin attenuates prostate cancer cell growth, we estimated the expression levels of Akt/p-Akt, P53, P21, BCL-2, and cleaved Caspase3 by using Western blot 48h after magnolin-treatment of the cells.  Results:   Magnolin inhibited the proliferation and viability of the tumor cells by triggering cell cycle arrest via P53/P21 activation and inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Magnolin downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt protein kinase and upregulated cleaved Caspase3 during anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis.

Primarily known as a regulator of neuronal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is also expressed in multiple human malignancies, where it promotes tumor angiogenesis. However, non-angiogenic roles of NRP1 in tumor progression remain poorly characterized. In this study, we define NRP1 as an androgen-repressed gene whose expression is elevated during the adaptation of prostate tumors to androgen-targeted therapies (ATTs), and subsequent progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of NRP1, we demonstrate that NRP1 regulates the mesenchymal phenotype of mCRPC cell models and the invasive and metastatic dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. In patients, immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays and mRNA expression analyses revealed a positive association between NRP1 expression and increasing Gleason grade, pathological T score, positive lymph node status and primary therapy failure. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of several large clinical prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts identified NRP1 expression at radical prostatectomy as an independent prognostic biomarker of biochemical recurrence after radiation therapy, metastasis and cancer-specific mortality. This study identifies NRP1 for the first time as a novel androgen-suppressed gene upregulated during the adaptive response of prostate tumors to ATTs and a prognostic biomarker of clinical metastasis and lethal PCa.""","""['B W C Tse', 'M Volpert', 'E Ratther', 'N Stylianou', 'M Nouri', 'K McGowan', 'M L Lehman', 'S J McPherson', 'M Roshan-Moniri', 'M S Butler', 'J Caradec', 'C Y Gregory-Evans', 'J McGovern', 'R Das', 'M Takhar', 'N Erho', 'M Alshalafa', 'E Davicioni', 'E M Schaeffer', 'R B Jenkins', 'A E Ross', 'R J Karnes', 'R B Den', 'L Fazli', 'P A Gregory', 'M E Gleave', 'E D Williams', 'P S Rennie', 'R Buttyan', 'J H Gunter', 'L A Selth', 'P J Russell', 'C C Nelson', 'B G Hollier']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The Neuropilin-1/PKC axis promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Differential Risk of Castration Resistance After Initial Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Neuropilin-1 promotes human glioma progression through potentiating the activity of the HGF/SF autocrine pathway.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropinâreleasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Using biological constraints to improve prediction in precision oncology.', 'NRP1 promotes prostate cancer progression via modulating EGFR-dependent AKT pathway activation.', 'Neuropilins as potential biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review of basic and clinical implications.', 'The Neuropilin-1/PKC axis promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and drug resistance of prostate cancer.']"""

The sensitivity and specificity of MRI parameters is determined via correlation with the gold-standard of histopathology. Whole-mount histopathology of prostatectomy specimens can be digitally registered to in vivo imaging for correlation. When biomechanical-based deformable registration is employed to account for deformation during histopathology processing, the ex vivo biomechanical properties are required. However, these properties are altered by pathology fixation, and vary with disease. Hence, this study employs magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to measure ex vivo prostate biomechanical properties before and after fixation. A quasi-static MRE method was employed to measure high resolution maps of Young's modulus (E) before and after fixation of canine prostate and prostatectomy specimens (n = 4) from prostate cancer patients who had previously received radiation therapy. For comparison, T 1, T 2 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in parallel. E (kPa) varied across clinical anatomy and for histopathology-identified tumor: peripheral zone: 99(Â±22), central gland: 48(Â±37), tumor: 85(Â±53), and increased consistently with fixation (factor of 11 Â± 5; p < 0.02). T 2 decreased consistently with fixation, while changes in T 1 and ADC were more complex and inconsistent. The biomechanics of the clinical prostate specimens varied greatly with fixation, and to a lesser extent with disease and anatomy.

The quality control mechanism within the ER distinguishes between properly and improperly folded proteins and ensures that unwanted proteins are retained in the ER and subsequently degraded through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Besides cleaning of misfolded proteins ERAD is also important for physiological processes by regulating the abundance of normal proteins of the ER. Thus it is important to unreveal the regulation patterns of ERAD. Here, we describe that ERAD pathway is regulated by androgen, where its inhibitor SVIP was downregulated, all other ERAD genes were upregulated. Consistently, androgen treatment increased the degradation rate of ERAD substrates. Using several independent techniques, we showed that this regulation is through androgen receptor transactivation. ERAD genes found to be upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and silencing expression of Hrd1, SVIP, and gp78 reduced the in vitro migration and malignant transformation of LNCaP cells. Our data suggests that expression levels of ERAD components are regulated by androgens, that promotes ERAD proteolytic activity, which is positively related with prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['Yalcin Erzurumlu', 'Petek Ballar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Progesterone regulates the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and Unfolded Protein Response axis by mimicking the androgenic stimulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'gp78 functions downstream of Hrd1 to promote degradation of misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum.', 'Epigenetic loss of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation inhibitor SVIP induces cancer cell metabolic reprogramming.', 'Physiological Roles of Ubiquitin Ligases Related to the Endoplasmic Reticulum.', 'Redox diversity in ERAD-mediated protein retrotranslocation from the endoplasmic reticulum: a complex puzzle.', 'HERPUD1, a Member of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Quality Control Mechanism, may be a Good Target for Suppressing Tumorigenesis in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Differential Expression and Function of SVIP in Breast Cancer Cell Lines and In Silico Analysis of Its Expression and Prognostic Potential in Human Breast Cancer.', 'Potent carotenoid astaxanthin expands the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin in human prostate cancer cells.', 'HRD1 promotes non-small cell lung carcinoma metastasis by blocking autophagy-mediated MIEN1 degradation.', 'Circadian Oscillation Pattern of Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) Components in Human Embryonic Kidney HEK293 Cells.']"""

Although PCa arises from the epithelium, the surrounding stroma has hormonal regulatory control over the epithelium and contributes to carcinogenesis. Herein, we describe regulation of microRNAs (miRs) by the active hormone dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in human prostate stroma. 1,25(OH)2D binds the vitamin D receptor (VDR) transcription factor to regulate gene expression, including miRs, which have emerged as potent regulators of protein expression. 1,25(OH)2D-regulated miRs were identified by profiling in primary human prostatic stromal cells (PrS) and three miRs, miR-126-3p, miR 154-5p and miR-21-5p were subsequently validated in laser-capture micro-dissected prostate stromal tissue from a vitamin D3 clinical trial (N=45). Regulation of these miRs by 1,25(OH)2D was VDR-dependent. Network analysis of known and putative mRNA targets of these miRs was enriched with cancer and inflammation pathways, consistent with known roles of stroma and of vitamin D in carcinogenesis. Expression of the miR processing ribonuclease, DICER1, positively correlated with vitamin D metabolite levels in the clinical trial specimens. High epithelial/stromal ratios of DICER1 were significantly associated biochemical recurrence (OR 3.1, p=0.03) in a tissue microarray of 170 matched PCa patients. In summary, these results underscore the role of the prostate stroma in regulating responses to the hormone 1,25(OH)2D and identified miRs and DICER1 as being regulated in human prostate stroma.

Here, we demonstrated that dysregulation of EglN2 facilitated prostate cancer growth both in cells and in vivo. Notably, EglN2 was identified highly expressed in human prostate cancer tissues. Mechanically, Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase SPOP, a well-characterized tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, could recognize and destruct EglN2. Meanwhile, androgen receptor (AR), playing a pivotal role in progression and development of prostate cancer, could transcriptionally up-regulate EglN2. Pathologically, SPOP loss-of-function mutations or AR amplification, frequently occurring in prostate cancers, could significantly accumulate EglN2 abundance.

We also studied the development of new and progressing existing chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men randomized to placebo in the REDUCE (REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events) population.  Materials and methods:   At multiple time points during 4 years univariable and multivariable analyses were performed between acute and chronic inflammation detected on baseline biopsies and the incidence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome-like symptoms, defined as a positive response to CPSI (Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index) question 1a-perineal pain and/or question 2b-ejaculatory pain and a total pain subscore of at least 4, and progression of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, defined as a 4-point or greater increase from baseline in total CPSI score, in patients with a baseline categorization of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.  Results:   Of the 4,109 men in the study acute and chronic inflammation was detected in 641 (15.6%) and 3,216 (78.3%), respectively. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome symptom status was available for 2,816 at baseline. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome-like symptoms developed in 317 of 2,150 men without the condition at baseline who had followup data. Acute and chronic inflammation was not associated with the incidence of the symptoms (p >0.1). At a median followup of 12.0 months 109 of 145 men with baseline chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and followup data showed symptomatic progression. Chronic but not acute inflammation was significantly associated with shorter time to progression on univariable and multivariable analyses (p = 0.029 and 0.018, respectively).

Estimates of prostate cancer progression from the Decipher genomic classifier (GC) could guide informed decision-making and improve the outcomes for patients.  Materials and methods:   We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with GC-based treatment decisions regarding adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy with those of 2 control strategies: usual care (determined from patterns of care studies) and the alternative of 100% adjuvant radiation therapy. Using the bootstrapping method of sampling with replacement, the cases of 10,000 patients were simulated during a 10-year time horizon, with each subject having individual estimates for cancer progression (according to GC findings) and noncancer mortality (according to age).  Results:   GC-based care was more effective and less costly than 100% adjuvant radiation therapy and resulted in cost savings up to an assay cost of $11,402. Compared with usual care, GC-based care resulted in more QALYs. Assuming a $4000 assay cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $90,833 per QALY, assuming a 7% usage rate of adjuvant radiation therapy. GC-based care was also associated with a 16% reduction in the percentage of patients with distant metastasis at 5 years compared with usual care.  Conclusion:   The Decipher GC could be a cost-effective approach for genomics-driven cancer treatment decisions after prostatectomy, with improvements in estimated clinical outcomes compared with usual care.

To obtain a high-quality treatment plan, the planner manually adjusts the objective weights using a trial-and-error procedure until an acceptable plan is reached. In this work, a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) method which can adjust the weighting factors automatically was investigated to overcome the requirement of manual adjustment, thereby reducing the workload of the human planner and contributing to the development of a fully automated planning process. The proposed optimization method consists of three steps. (i) First, a swarm of weighting factors (i.e., particles) is initialized randomly in the search space, where each particle corresponds to a global objective function. (ii) Then, a plan optimization solver is employed to obtain the optimal solution for each particle, and the values of the evaluation functions used to determine the particle's location and the population global location for the PSO are calculated based on these results. (iii) Next, the weighting factors are updated based on the particle's location and the population global location. Step (ii) is performed alternately with step (iii) until the termination condition is reached. In this method, the evaluation function is a combination of several key points on the dose volume histograms. Furthermore, a perturbation strategy - the crossover and mutation operator hybrid approach - is employed to enhance the population diversity, and two arguments are applied to the evaluation function to improve the flexibility of the algorithm. In this study, the proposed method was used to develop IMRT treatment plans involving five unequally spaced 6MV photon beams for 10 prostate cancer cases. The proposed optimization algorithm yielded high-quality plans for all of the cases, without human planner intervention. A comparison of the results with the optimized solution obtained using a similar optimization model but with human planner intervention revealed that the proposed algorithm produced optimized plans superior to that developed using the manual plan. The proposed algorithm can generate admissible solutions within reasonable computational times and can be used to develop fully automated IMRT treatment planning methods, thus reducing human planners' workloads during iterative processes.""","""['Jie Yang', 'Pengcheng Zhang', 'Liyuan Zhang', 'Huazhong Shu', 'Baosheng Li', 'Zhiguo Gui']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Automatic learning-based beam angle selection for thoracic IMRT.', 'A particle swarm optimization algorithm for beam angle selection in intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Parallel operated hybrid Arithmetic-Salp swarm optimizer for optimal allocation of multiple distributed generation units in distribution networks.', 'Biological optimization for mediastinal lymphoma radiotherapy - a preliminary study.']"""

Because the spacer is initially injected into the perirectal space as a liquid, the final distribution can vary. The purpose of this study was to evaluate hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR system) implantation and distribution from a recent prospective randomized control trial and correlate spacer symmetry with rectal dose reduction as well as rectal wall infiltration (RWI) to acute and late toxicity.  Methods and materials:   T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sets of 149 patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial who received transperineal spacer injection were assessed for hydrogel spacer midline symmetry and RWI using a semiqualitative scoring system. Symmetry was then correlated to rectal dose reduction using a Student t test (1-tailed, paired), whereas a Fisher exact test was used to correlate RWI with acute and late rectal toxicity. All patients had control treatment plans created before spacer injection.  Results:   Hydrogel spacer was symmetrically placed at midline for 71 (47.7%) patients at the prostate midgland as well as 1 cm superior and inferior to midgland. The remaining 78 (50.9%) patients had some level of asymmetry, with only 2 (1.3%) having far lateral distribution (ie, >2 cm) of hydrogel spacer. As the hydrogel spacer became more asymmetric, the level of rectal dose reduction relative to their control plans decreased. However, all but the most asymmetrical 1.3% had significant rectal dose reduction (P < .05). Rectal wall hydrogel spacer infiltration was seen in 9 (6.0%) patients. There was no correlation between RWI and procedure-related adverse events or acute/late rectal toxicity.  Conclusions:   Significant reduction of rectal dose can still be achieved even in the setting of asymmetric hydrogel spacer placement.

Methods:   We identified men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (based on D×³Amico criteria) in the National Cancer Database (2010-2012). Primary outcome was NDM (i.e., delayed/no treatment with prostatectomy/radiation therapy or androgen-deprivation monotherapy). Treating facilities were classified by quartiles of proportions of patients treated with advanced technology. Multivariable regression estimated odds of primary outcome based on race, insurance status, and facility-level technology use, and evaluated for interactions between these covariates.  Results:   Among 60,300 patients, 9,265 (15.4%) received NDM. This was more common among non-White men (P<0.001), Medicaid/uninsured patients (P<0.001), and those managed at facilities in the lowest quartile of technology use (25.1% vs. 11.0% highest, P<0.001). Though NDM was common among non-White men with Medicaid/no insurance treated at low-technology centers (43% vs. 10% White, private/Medicare, high-tech facility; adjusted odds ratios = 7.18, P<0.001), this was less likely if this group was managed at a high-tech hospital (22% vs. 43% low-tech, P<0.001).

We aimed to investigate the regulation and mechanism of microRNA (miR-143) in the proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer LNCap cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS miR-143 and control scramble miRNA were synthesized and respectively transfected into LNCap cells. The proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activity assay. The intracellular expression of Bcl-2 was determined by Western blot. Further, LNCap cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Bcl-2 (siBcl-2) or plasmid expressing Bcl-2, followed by transfection of miR-143 or control miRNA. Bcl-2 expression was detected by Western blot, and cell apoptosis was measured by caspase-3 activity assay. RESULTS Transfection of miR-143 significantly inhibited the proliferation of LNCap cells (P=0.0073), increased the percentage of externalized phosphatidylserine (P=0.0042), activated the caspase-3 (P=0.0012), and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 (P=0.012) when compared with the control miRNA group. The expression of Bcl-2 was significantly reduced after siBcl-2 transfection. The apoptosis in the siBcl-2+miR-143 group was significantly increased compared with that in the miR-143 group (P=0.036), whereas there was no significant difference in the apoptosis between the siBcl-2+miRNA and miRNA groups. The expression of Bcl-2 was obviously higher after the transfection of Bcl-2-expressing plasmid. The apoptosis in Bcl-2+miR-143 group was significantly reduced compared with the miR-143 group (P=0.031), whereas no significant difference in the apoptosis was detected between the miRNA and Bcl-2+miRNA groups.

This therapeutic potential is limited by the fast washout of the conjugates from the target tumors. WST-11 (Weizmann STeba-11 drug; a negatively charged water-soluble palladium-bacteriochlorophyll derivative, Tookad Soluble) vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) is a local ablation approach recently approved for use in early-stage prostate cancer. It generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species within tumor blood vessels, resulting in their instantaneous destruction followed by rapid tumor necrosis. We hypothesize that the instantaneous arrest of tumor vasculature may provide a means to trap radiopharmaceuticals within the tumor, thereby improving the efficacy of targeted radiotherapy.Experimental Design: GRPr-positive prostate cancer xenografts (PC-3 and VCaP) were treated with 90Y-DOTA-AR with or without VTP. The uptake of radioisotopes was monitored by Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). The therapeutic efficacy of the combined VTP and 90Y-DOTA-AR in PC-3 xenografts was assessed.Results: CLI of 90Y-DOTA-AR demonstrated longer retention of radiotracer within the VTP-treated PC-3 xenografts compared with the non-VTP-treated ones (P < 0.05) at all time points (24-144 hours) after 90Y-DOTA-AR injection. A similar pattern of retention was observed in VCaP xenografts. When 90Y-DOTA-AR administration was combined with VTP, tumor growth delay was significantly longer than for the control or the monotherapy groups.Conclusions: Tumor vascular arrest by VTP improves 90Y-DOTA-AR retention in the tumor microenvironment thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

In a recent retrospective study, late radiation toxicity was found to relate to a decreased decay of Î³-H2AX foci and reduced induction of DNA double-strand break repair genes. Here, we report evidence of prognostic utility in prostate cancer for Î³-H2AX foci decay ratios and gene expression profiles derived from ex vivo-irradiated patient lymphocytes. Patients were followed â¥2 years after radiotherapy. Clinical characteristics were assembled, and toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0. No clinical factor was correlated with late radiation toxicity. The Î³-H2AX foci decay ratio correlated negatively with toxicity grade, with a significant difference between grade â¥3 and grade 0 patients (P = 0.02). A threshold foci decay ratio, determined in our retrospective study, correctly classified 23 of 28 patients with grade â¥3 toxicity (sensitivity 82%) and 9 of 14 patients with grade 0 toxicity (specificity 64%). Induction of homologous recombination (HR) repair genes was reduced with increasing toxicity grade. The difference in fold induction of the HR gene set was most pronounced between grade 0 and grade â¥3 toxicity (P = 0.008). Notably, reduced responsiveness of HR repair genes to irradiation and inefficient double-strand break repair correlated with severe late radiation toxicity.

Although pre-exposure to mild oxidative agents will sensitize cancer cells to radiation, this pre-exposure may also activate the adaptive stress defense system in normal cells. Ascorbic acid is a prototype redox modulator that when infused intravenously appears to kill cancers without injury to normal tissues; however, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. In this study, we show how ascorbic acid kills cancer cells and sensitizes prostate cancer to radiation therapy while also conferring protection upon normal prostate epithelial cells against radiation-induced injury. We found that the NF-ÎºB transcription factor RelB is a pivotal determinant in the differential radiosensitization effects of ascorbic acid in prostate cancer cells and normal prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistically, high reactive oxygen species concentrations suppress RelB in cancer cells. RelB suppression decreases expression of the sirtuin SIRT3 and the powerful antioxidant MnSOD, which in turn increases oxidative and metabolic stresses in prostate cancer cells. In contrast, ascorbic acid enhances RelB expression in normal cells, improving antioxidant and metabolic defenses against radiation injury. In addition to showing how RelB mediates the differential effects of ascorbic acid on cancer and normal tissue radiosensitivities, our work also provides a proof of concept for the existence of redox modulators that can improve the efficacy of radiotherapy while protecting against normal tissue injury in cancer settings.

TBX2, a T-box family transcription factor that negatively regulates cell-cycle inhibitor p21, plays critical roles during embryonic development, and recent studies have highlighted its role in cancer. Here, we report that TBX2 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer specimens and bone metastases from xenograft mouse models of human prostate cancer. Blocking endogenous TBX2 expression in PC3 and ARCaPM prostate cancer cell models using a dominant-negative construct resulted in decreased tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion in vitro Blocking endogenous TBX2 in human prostate cancer mouse xenografts decreased invasion and abrogation of bone and soft tissue metastasis. Furthermore, blocking endogenous TBX2 in prostate cancer cells dramatically reduced bone-colonizing capability through reduced tumor cell growth and bone remodeling in an intratibial mouse model. TBX2 acted in trans by promoting transcription of the canonical WNT (WNT3A) promoter. Genetically rescuing WNT3A levels in prostate cancer cells with endogenously blocked TBX2 partially restored the TBX2-induced prostate cancer metastatic capability in mice. Conversely, WNT3A-neutralizing antibodies or WNT antagonist SFRP-2 blocked TBX2-induced invasion. Our findings highlight TBX2 as a novel therapeutic target upstream of WNT3A, where WNT3A antagonists could be novel agents for the treatment of metastasis and for skeletal complications in prostate cancer patients.

Mechanistically, we recently discovered that both TPÎ± and TPÎ² form functional signalling complexes with members of the protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) family, AGC- kinases essential for the epigenetic regulation of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription and promising therapeutic targets for treatment of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Critically, similar to androgens, activation of the PRKs through the TXA2/TP signalling axis induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr11 (H3Thr11), a marker of androgen-induced chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activation, raising the possibility that TXA2-TP signalling can mimic and/or enhance AR-induced cellular changes even in the absence of circulating androgens such as in CRPC. Hence the aim of the current study was to investigate whether TXA2/TP-induced PRK activation can mimic and/or enhance AR-mediated cellular responses in the model androgen-responsive prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cell line. We reveal that TXA2/TP signalling can act as a neoplastic- and epigenetic-regulator, promoting and enhancing both AR-associated chromatin remodelling (H3Thr11 phosphorylation, WDR5 recruitment and acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16) and AR-mediated transcriptional activation (e.g of the KLK3/prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 genes) through mechanisms involving TPÎ±/TPÎ² mediated-PRK1 and PRK2, but not PRK3, signalling complexes. Overall, these data demonstrate that TPÎ±/TPÎ² can act as neoplastic and epigenetic regulators by mimicking and/or enhancing the actions of androgens within the prostate and provides further mechanistic insights into the role of the TXA2/TP signalling axis in PCa, including potentially in CRPC.""","""[""Aine G O'Sullivan"", 'Eamon P Mulvaney', 'B Therese Kinsella']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis""","""['Protein kinase C-related kinase 1 and 2 play an essential role in thromboxane-mediated neoplastic responses in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of an interaction between the TPalpha and TPbeta isoforms of the human thromboxane A2 receptor with protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) 1: implications for prostate cancer.', 'Regulated expression of the TPÎ² isoform of the human T prostanoid receptor by the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1: Implications for the role of thromboxane in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of the Human Thromboxane A2 Receptor Gene by Wilmsâ Tumour (WT)1.', 'Cell signalling through thromboxane A2 receptors.', 'Prostanoid Signaling in Cancers: Expression and Regulation Patterns of Enzymes and Receptors.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer Increases Serum Levels of Thromboxane A2: Cardiovascular Implications.', 'The structure and function of protein kinase C-related kinases (PRKs).', '1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments of the HR1c domain of PRK1, a protein kinase C-related kinase.']"""

Although IMRT can deliver high and complex conformational doses to the tumor volume, its implementation requires rigorous quality assurance (QA) procedures that include a dosimetric pre-treatment verification of individual patient planning. This verification usually involves measuring a small volume of absolute dose with an ionization chamber and checking bi-dimensional fluency with an array of detectors. The planning technique has tri-dimensional characteristics, but no tridimensional dosimetry has been established in the clinical routine. One strategy to perform three-dimensional dosimetry is to use polymeric gels associated with magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate dose distribution. Here, we have compared the results of conventional QA procedures involving one- and two-dimensional dosimetry to the results of three-dimensional dosimetry conducted with MAGIC-f gel in 10 cases of prostate cancer IMRT planning. More specifically, we used the gamma index (3%/3mm) to compare the results of three-dimensional dosimetry to the expected dose distributions obtained with the treatment planning system.

Methods and patients:   Consecutive men with suspicion of prostate cancer underwent a 12 core TRUS prostate biopsy; age, total serum PSA, percent free PSA, family history, ethnic origin and prostate ultrasound results were used for risk assessment using the online nomograms. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation from 8ml of blood and CPCs were identified using double immunomarcation with anti-PSA and anti-P504S. A CPC was defined as a cell expressing PSA and P504S and defined as negative/positive. Biopsies were classified as cancer/no-cancer. Areas under the curve (AUC) for each parameter were calculated and compared and diagnostic yields were calculated.  Results:   1,223 men aged>55 years participated, 467 (38.2%) had a biopsy positive for cancer of whom 114/467 (24.4%) complied with the criteria for active observation. Area under the curve analysis showed CPC detection to be superior (p<0.001), avoiding 57% of potential biopsies while missing 4% of clinically significant prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   The CPC detection was superior to the nomograms in predicting the presence of prostate cancer at initial biopsy; its high negative predictive value potentially reduces the number of biopsies while missing few significant cancers, being superior to the nomograms in this aspect.

Development of chemoresistance, tumor relapse and metastasis remain major barriers to effective treatment and all been identified to be associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Natural flavonoids such as apigenin have been shown to have the ability to improve the therapeutic efficacy of common chemotherapy agents through CSCs sensitization. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of apigenin with cisplatin on CD44+ PCa stem cell growth and migration. Platinum-based anti-neoplastic drugs have been used to treat a number of malignancies including PCa. However, acquired resistance and side effects unfortunately have limited cisplatin's use. A CD44+ subpopulation was isolated from human androgen-independent PC3 PCa cells by using human CD44-PE antibody. IC50 values were determined by MTT test. RT-qPCR, Western blot analyses and image-based cytometer were used to investigate apoptosis, cell cycle and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing test. The combination of the IC50 doses of apigenin (15Î¼M) and cisplatin (7.5Î¼M) for 48h significantly enhanced cisplatin's cytotoxic and apoptotic effects through downregulation of Bcl-2, sharpin and survivin; and upregulation of caspase-8, Apaf-1 and p53 mRNA expression. The combined therapy suppressed the phosphorylation of p-PI3K and p-Akt, inhibited the protein expression of NF-ÎºB, and downregulated the cell cycle by upregulating p21, as well as cyclin dependent kinases CDK-2, -4, and -6. Apigenin significantly increased the inhibitory effects of cisplatin on cell migration via downregulation of Snail expression.

Immunohistochemically, DVL3 positivity was associated with high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, resection margin involvement, and BCR (all, P < 0.05). A high Gleason score indicated a marginal relationship (P = 0.055). BIM positivity was related to high PSA levels, lymphovascular invasion, and BCR (all, P < 0.05). Both DVL3 positivity (P = 0.010) and BIM positivity (P = 0.024) were associated with shorter RFS, but statistical significance was lost when the multivariate Cox regression model included all patients. In the lower-risk group, the multivariate Cox model confirmed that DVL3 was an independent predictor for poor RFS (hazard ratio 1.80, P = 0.040), and the concordance index (C-index) was 0.805.  Conclusions:   DVL3 and BIM were expressed in patients with a higher risk of BCR. DVL3 may be a novel and easily applicable recurrence predictor of localised prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['Pil-Jong Kim', 'Ji Y Park', 'Hong-Gee Kim', 'Yong Mee Cho', 'Heounjeong Go']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Large-scale independent validation of the nuclear factor-kappa B p65 prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of ERG and Wild-Type PTEN Are Associated with Favorable Clinical Prognosis and Low Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'Percentage of high-grade tumour volume does not meaningfully improve prediction of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy compared with Gleason score.', 'Pathological significance and predictive value for biochemical recurrence of c-Fes expression in prostate cancer.', 'RNA-Binding Protein MEX3A Interacting with DVL3 Stabilizes Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling in Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Construction and validation of N6-methyladenosine long non-coding RNAs signature of prognostic value for early biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Can We Pharmacologically Target Dishevelled: The Key Signal Transducer in the Wnt Pathways?', 'LncRNA BLACAT1 Promotes Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of Prostate Cancer Cells via Regulating miR-29a-3p/DVL3 Axis.', 'A qualitative transcriptional signature for predicting the biochemical recurrence risk of prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, there is increasing evidence that proton RBE vary with the linear energy transfer (LET), the dose per fraction, and the type of the tissue. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of disregarding variations in RBE when comparing proton and photon dose plans for prostate treatments for various fractionation schedules using published RBE models and several Î±/Î² assumptions.  Methods:   Photon and proton dose plans were created for three generic prostate cancer cases. Three BED3Gy equivalent schedules were studied, 78, 57.2, and 42.8 Gy in 39, 15, and 7 fractions, respectively. The proton plans were optimized assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. By using the Monte Carlo calculated dose-averaged LET (LETd ) distribution and assuming Î±/Î² values on voxel level, three variable RBE models were applied to the proton dose plans. The impact of the variable RBE was studied in the plan comparison, which was based on the dose distribution, DVHs, and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum. Subsequently, the physical proton dose was reoptimized for each proton plan based on the LETd distribution, to achieve a homogeneous RBE-weighted target dose when applying a specific RBE model and still fulfill the clinical goals for the rectum and bladder.  Results:   All the photon and proton plans assuming RBE = 1.1 met the clinical goals with similar target coverage. The proton plans fulfilled the robustness criteria in terms of range and setup uncertainty. Applying the variable RBE models generally resulted in higher target doses and rectum NTCP compared to the photon plans. The increase was most pronounced for the fractionation dose of 2 Gy(RBE), whereas it was of less magnitude and more dependent on model and Î±/Î² assumption for the hypofractionated schedules. The reoptimized proton plans proved to be robust and showed similar target coverage and doses to the organs at risk as the proton plans optimized with a constant RBE.  Conclusions:   Model predicted RBE values may differ substantially from 1.1. This is most pronounced for fractionation doses of around 2 Gy(RBE) with higher doses to the target and the OARs, whereas the effect seems to be of less importance for the hypofractionated schedules. This could result in misleading conclusions when comparing proton plans to photon plans. By accounting for a variable RBE in the optimization process, robust and clinically acceptable dose plans, with the potential of lowering rectal NTCP, may be generated by reoptimizing the physical dose. However, the direction and magnitude of the changes in the physical proton dose to the prostate are dependent on RBE model and Î±/Î² assumptions and should therefore be used conservatively.""","""['Jakob ÃdÃ©n', 'Kjell Eriksson', 'Iuliana Toma-Dasu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Biological dose and complication probabilities for the rectum and bladder based on linear energy transfer distributions in spot scanning proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Helical tomotherapy vs. intensity-modulated proton therapy for whole pelvis irradiation in high-risk prostate cancer patients: dosimetric, normal tissue complication probability, and generalized equivalent uniform dose analysis.', 'Disregarding RBE variation in treatment plan comparison may lead to bias in favor of proton plans.', 'Modelling variable proton relative biological effectiveness for treatment planning.', 'Proton relative\xa0biological\xa0effectiveness (RBE): a multiscale problem.', 'Proton linear energy transfer and variable relative biological effectiveness for adolescent patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'An iterative convex relaxation method for proton LET optimization.', 'Acute toxicity and patient-reported symptom score after conventional versus moderately hypofractionated proton therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Biological Impact of Target Fragments on Proton Treatment Plans: An Analysis Based on the Current Cross-Section Data and a Full Mixed Field Approach.', 'A Critical Review of LET-Based Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy Plan Evaluation and Optimization for Head and Neck Cancer Management.']"""

Design:   Qualitative serial (4-12 week intervals) interview study with people with advanced cancer and their informal carers followed by focus groups. The iterative design had a novel focus on positive coping strategies. Interview analysis focused on patients and carers as individuals and pairs, exploring multiple dimensions of their coping experiences. Focus group analysis explored strategies for intervention development.  Participants:   26 people with advanced (stage 3-4) breast, prostate, lung or colorectal cancer, or in receipt of palliative care, and 24 paired nominated informal/family carers.  Setting:   Participants recruited through outpatient clinics at two tertiary cancer centres in Merseyside and Manchester, UK, between June 2012 and July 2013.  Results:   45 patient and 41 carer interviews were conducted plus 4 focus groups (16 participants). People with advanced cancer and their informal/family carers develop coping strategies which enable effective management of psychological wellbeing. People draw from pre-diagnosis coping strategies, but these develop through responding to the experience of living with advanced cancer. Strategies include being realistic, indulgence, support, and learning from others, which enabled participants to regain a sense of wellbeing after emotional challenge. Learning from peers emerged as particularly important in promoting psychological wellbeing through the development of effective 'everyday', non-clinical coping strategies.  Conclusions:   Our findings challenge current models of providing psychological support for those with advanced cancer which focus on professional intervention. It is important to recognise, enable and support peoples' own resources and coping strategies.

In vitro studies revealed that miR-744 promotes PCa cells proliferation, enhances migration, invasion; in vivo results demonstrated that silencing of miR-744 mediated by shRNA dramatically reduces PCa xenograft tumor growth. Importantly, through human gene expression array, pathway enrichment analysis and Western blot, we identified that miR-744 dramatically activated Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway by targeting multiple negative regulators of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, including SFRP1, GSK3Î², TLE3 and NKD1.

Conversely, SIRs were also calculated for a subsequent HL/NHL following other first cancers. The risk of developing SPM was significantly increased over twofold for HL survivors (SIR = 2Â·14, EAR = 51Â·87 cases/10 000 person-years) and 1Â·5-fold for NHL survivors (SIR = 1Â·48, EAR = 55Â·23) compared with the general German population. For solid cancers, SIRs were significantly elevated (1Â·6- and 1Â·4-fold; respectively) and were highest (threefold) in patients below 30 years of age upon initial diagnosis. Overall, SIRs were consistently elevated for lip/oral cavity, colon/rectum, lung, skin melanoma, breast, kidney and thyroid. Significantly increased SIRs for oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, testis, prostate, and brain/central nervous system were observed following NHL only. For certain SPM, SIRs remained significantly elevated more than 10 years following HL/NHL diagnosis. Positive reciprocal associations were demonstrated between HL/NHL and several solid cancers mentioned above; for some, common aetiological mechanisms seem plausible.""","""['Nadia Baras', 'Stefan Dahm', 'JÃ¶rg Haberland', 'Martin Janz', 'Katharina Emrich', 'Klaus Kraywinkel', 'Abdulgabar Salama']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Haematol""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Incidence and epidemiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and risk of second malignancy among 22\u2009466 survivors in Israel with 30\u2009years of follow-up.', 'Development of second primary malignancy in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a nationwide population-based study.', ""Primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome is associated with increased risk of malignancies besides lymphoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis."", ""Increased risk of second lung cancer in Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors: a meta-analysis."", 'The impact of prior malignancies on the development of second malignancies and survival in follicular lymphoma: A population-based study.', ""Trends in the risk of second primary malignances after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."", 'Orbital Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma and Primary Cutaneous Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Rare Case Report and Review of the Literature.', 'Risk for malignancies of infectious etiology among adult survivors of specific non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer After Mantle Radiation: A Case Report and Brief Review.']"""

Here, the Ubiquitously expressed Transcript (UXT) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid assay with LOX-PP as bait and confirmed as a novel LOX-PP associating protein. UXT, a prefoldin-like protein, is ubiquitous in human and mouse. Since UXT modulates androgen receptor transcriptional activity in prostate cancer, we studied its role in breast cancer. Breast tumors and derived cell lines overexpressed UXT. UXT was able to associate with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and decrease its transcriptional activity and target gene expression. Conversely, UXT knockdown increased ER element-dependent transcriptional activity. Ectopic LOX-PP relocalized UXT to the cytoplasm and decreased its stability. UXT ubiquitination and depletion in the presence of LOX-PP was rescued by a proteasomal inhibitor. In summary, proteasome-mediated turnover of UXT upon interaction with LOX-PP releases repression of ER transcriptional activity. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 2347-2356, 2017.

CRC molecular pathogenesis is heterogeneous and may be followed by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, chromosomal and microsatellite instability, alternative splicing alterations, hypermethylation of CpG islands, oxidative stress, impairment of different signaling pathways and energy metabolism. In the present work, we have studied the alterations of alternative splicing patterns of genes related to energy metabolism in CRC.  Results:   Using CrossHub software, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Seq datasets derived from colon tumor and matched normal tissues. The expression of 1014 alternative mRNA isoforms involved in cell energy metabolism was examined. We found 7 genes with differentially expressed alternative transcripts whereas overall expression of these genes was not significantly altered in CRC. A set of 8 differentially expressed transcripts of interest has been validated by qPCR. These eight isoforms encoded by OGDH, COL6A3, ICAM1, PHPT1, PPP2R5D, SLC29A1, and TRIB3 genes were up-regulated in colorectal tumors, and this is in concordance with the bioinformatics data. The alternative transcript NM_057167 of COL6A3 was also strongly up-regulated in breast, lung, prostate, and kidney tumors. Alternative transcript of SLC29A1 (NM_001078177) was up-regulated only in CRC samples, but not in the other tested tumor types.  Conclusions:   We identified tumor-specific expression of alternative spliced transcripts of seven genes involved in energy metabolism in CRC.

We developed the ProCan intervention to ameliorate sexual and urological dysfunction after radical prostatectomy and examined its feasibility, acceptability and changes in sexual function.  Material and methods:   Between May 2014 and October 2014, seven couples attending the Department of Urology, Rigshospitalet, were included 3-4 weeks after radical prostatectomy in the ProCan intervention, which consists of up to six couple counselling sessions, group instruction in pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), up to three individual PFMT sessions and a DVD home training program. We examined its feasibility on the basis of the recruitment rate, adherence to and acceptability of the intervention, the response rate and changes in erectile and sexual functioning measured on the International Index of Erectile Function at baseline and at eight and 12 months.  Results:   The recruitment rate was 14%. One couple withdrew, six couples attended 1-4 counselling sessions, and all patients attended PFMT until continence was achieved. The response rate on outcomes was 85% for patients and 71% for partners. The couples reported that counselling improved their sex life but it did not improve their ability to talk openly about sex. Most patients found that the physiotherapist improved their motivation and the quality and intensity of PFMT. Erectile dysfunction improved from severe at baseline to moderate at eight months' follow-up, and mean sexual functioning improved from 18.4 to 37.1 points at eight months' follow-up, but decreased slightly to 31.4 at 12 months.

The inhibition of CK2 activity represses androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells by attenuating the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. In this study, we examined the effect of CK2 inhibition in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells, in which AR variants (ARVs) play a predominant role.  Methods:   A newly synthetic CK2 selective inhibitor CX4945 was utilized to study the effect of CK2 inhibition in CRPC cells by CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. Protein and mRNA levels of full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7 were determined by qPCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 was assessed to reflect the activity of the NF-ÎºB pathway.  Results:   CX4945 reduced the proliferation of CRPC cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. AR-V7 rather than AR-FL was downregulated by CX4945 in both the mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, CX4945 could restore the sensitivity of CRPC cells to bicalutamide. The analysis of possible mechanisms demonstrated that the inhibition of CK2 diminished the phosphorylation of p65 at ser529 and thus attenuated the activity of the NF-ÎºB pathway.  Conclusion:   The inhibition of CK2 by CX4945 can repress the viability of CRPC cells and restore their sensitivity to anti-androgen therapy by suppressing AR-V7.

The role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in the pathogenesis and progression of human PCa remains poorly understood. In contradiction with breast cancer, studies on HER2 overexpression and gene amplification in PCa have produced varying results, although the HER2 oncogene has been implicated in the biology of numerous tumor types, and serves as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Technical challenges are considered the main reasons for data discrepancies. Amplification of the HER2 gene has previously been reported in PCa, in which it was associated with tumor progression. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of HER2 amplification in PCa. A total of 32 biopsy samples obtained from human prostate adenocarcinomas were evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) to determine the frequency of patients with HER2 gene amplifications. High copy numbers of HER2 were detected in 19 of the prostate tumors analyzed. The results of the present study suggested that, in patients without amplification of HER2, high levels of prostate-specific antigen or a high Gleason score were not significantly correlated with a high pathologic stage. Furthermore, amplification levels of the HER2 gene were directly associated with pathologic stage in patients with PCa.

Targeted RNA sequencing was performed on enriched circulating tumour cell fractions to assess the expression levels of seven AR splice variants (ARVs).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Somatic AR variations, including copy-number alterations, structural variations, and point mutations, were combined with ARV expression patterns and correlated to clinicopathologic parameters.  Results and limitations:   Collectively, any AR perturbation, including ARV, was detected in 25/30 patients. Surprisingly, intra-AR structural variation was present in 15/30 patients, of whom 14 expressed ARVs. The majority of ARV-positive patients expressed multiple ARVs, with AR-V3 the most abundantly expressed. The presence of any ARV was associated with progression-free survival after second-line endocrine treatment (hazard ratio 4.53, 95% confidence interval 1.424-14.41; p=0.0105). Six out of 17 poor responders were AR-V7-negative, but four carried other AR perturbations.  Conclusions:   Comprehensive AR profiling, which is feasible using liquid biopsies, is necessary to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning resistance to endocrine treatment.  Patient summary:   Alterations in the androgen receptor are associated with endocrine treatment outcomes. This study demonstrates that it is possible to identify different types of alterations via simple blood draws. Follow-up studies are needed to determine the effect of such alterations on hormonal therapy.""","""['Bram De Laere', 'Pieter-Jan van Dam', 'Tom Whitington', 'Markus Mayrhofer', 'Emanuela Henao Diaz', 'Gert Van den Eynden', 'Jean Vandebroek', 'Jurgen Del-Favero', 'Steven Van Laere', 'Luc Dirix', 'Henrik GrÃ¶nberg', 'Johan Lindberg']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Investigating Genomic Aberrations of the Androgen Receptor: Moving Closer to More Precise Prostate Cancer Care?', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'The Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Plasma-derived Exosomal RNA Strongly Predicts Resistance to Hormonal Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Clinical Utility of Circulating Tumour Cell Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Status in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Bone scan index (BSI) scoring by using bone scintigraphy and circulating tumor cells (CTCs): predictive factors for enzalutamide effectiveness in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'The positive relationship between androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression and the risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A cumulative analysis.', 'Plasma extracellular vesicle circRNA signature and resistance to abiraterone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Cancers associated with viruses such as nonmelanotic skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma occur in allograft recipients at rates that far exceed that in the general population. The increased risk and tumor type may depend not only on degree of immune system modulation but also on the type of organ transplanted. In kidney transplant recipients, the risk of cancers such as prostate and breast does not seem to be increased. However, these cancers tend to be advanced and aggressive. The management of these cancers is similar to the general population with the additional consideration for reduction in immunosuppression and conversion to sirolimus. Given the increased survival of both transplanted organs as well as organ recipients along with the increased number of older recipients, the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the older male organ recipient is increasing. The long-term outcomes using current treatment guidelines for prostate cancer in these individuals are not clear. We report a case of known localized prostate cancer in a renal transplant recipient presenting with metastasis diagnosed as tumor infiltration of the allograft. Our patient, upon initial diagnosis of cancer, opted for radiation with eventual androgen-deprivation therapy.

We aimed to examine the extent to which the definition of the study population affects cancer incidence rates.  Methods:   All primary cancer diagnoses in Sweden between 1958 and 2010 were identified from the national Cancer Register. Age-standardized and age-specific incidence rates of 29 cancer subtypes between 2000 and 2010 were calculated using four definitions of the study population: persons resident in Sweden 1) based on general population statistics; 2) with no previous subtype-specific cancer diagnosis; 3) with no previous cancer diagnosis except non-melanoma skin cancer; and 4) with no previous cancer diagnosis of any type. We calculated absolute and relative differences between methods.  Results:   Age-standardized incidence rates calculated using general population statistics ranged from 6% lower (prostate cancer, incidence rate difference: -13.5/100,000 person-years) to 8% higher (breast cancer in women, incidence rate difference: 10.5/100,000 person-years) than incidence rates based on individuals with no previous subtype-specific cancer diagnosis. Age-standardized incidence rates in persons with no previous cancer of any type were up to 10% lower (bladder cancer in women) than rates in those with no previous subtype-specific cancer diagnosis; however, absolute differences were <5/100,000 person-years for all cancer subtypes.  Conclusions:   For some cancer subtypes incidence rates vary depending on the definition of the study population. For these subtypes, standardized incidence ratios calculated using general population statistics could be misleading.

However, the cause of prostate cancer disparities is still unclear. Several roles have been proposed for calcium and vitamin D in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression, but epidemiologic studies have been conducted mainly in European descent populations. Here we investigated the association of calcium and vitamin D intake with prostate cancer in multiethnic samples.  Methods:   A total of 1,657 prostate cancer patients who underwent screening and healthy controls (888 African Americans, 620 European Americans, 111 Hispanic Americans, and 38 others) from Chicago, IL and Washington, D.C. were included in this study. Calcium and vitamin D intake were evaluated using food frequency questionnaire. We performed unconditional logistic regression analyses adjusting for relevant variables.  Results:   In the pooled data set, high calcium intake was significantly associated with higher odds for aggressive prostate cancer (ORQuartile 1 vs. Quartile 4 = 1.98, 95% C.I.: 1.01-3.91), while high vitamin D intake was associated with lower odds of aggressive prostate cancer (ORQuartile 1 vs. Quartile 4 = 0.38, 95% C.I.: 0.18-0.79). In African Americans, the association between high calcium intake and aggressive prostate cancer was statistically significant (ORQuartile 1 vs. Quartile 4 = 4.28, 95% C.I.: 1.70-10.80). We also observed a strong inverse association between total vitamin D intake and prostate cancer in African Americans (ORQuartile 1 vs. Quartile 4 = 0.06, 95% C.I.: 0.02-0.54). In European Americas, we did not observe any significant associations between either calcium or vitamin D intake and prostate cancer. In analyses stratifying participants based on Body Mass Index (BMI), we observed a strong positive association between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer and a strong inverse association between vitamin D intake and aggressive prostate cancer among men with low BMI (<27.8 kg/m2), but not among men with high BMI (â¥27.8 kg/m2). Interactions of race and BMI with vitamin D intake were significant (P Interaction < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Calcium intake was positively associated with aggressive prostate cancer, while vitamin D intake exhibited an inverse relationship.

Parallel work revealed that endothelial cells (ECs) create a perivascular CSC niche mediated by juxtacrine and membrane tethered signaling.

IGR-CaP1 cells expressed the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin, near equivalent levels of vimentin and e-cadherin, all of the EMT transcription factors, and activation of NOTCH and WNT pathways. In parallel, we created a new triple-targeted adenoviral vector containing a fiber knob RGD peptide, a hexon mutation, and an EC specific ROBO4 promoter (Ad.RGD.H5/3.ROBO4).

Since a normal prostate gland has a high ZnII content and there are huge differences in ZnII content between healthy and malignant prostate cancer cells, mobile zinc can be used as a biomarker for prostate cancer prediction. A highly efficient surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) probe using a p-(imidazole)azo)benzenethiol attached gold nanoparticle as a Raman reporter, which has the capability to identify prostate cancer cells based on ZnII sensing, has been designed. A facile synthesis, characterization and evaluation of a ZnII sensing Raman probe are described. Reported data indicate that after binding with ZnII , Raman reporter attached to a gold nanoparticle forms an assembly structure, which allows selective detection of ZnII even at 100 ppt concentration. Theoretical full-wave finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations have been used to understand the enhancement of the SERS signal. The SERS probe is highly promising for in vivo sensing of cancer, where near-IR light can be easily used to avoid tissue autofluorescence and to enhance tissue penetration depth. Reported data show that the SERS probe can distinguish metastatic cancer cells from normal prostate cells very easily with a sensitivity as low as 5 cancer cells mL-1 .

This study provides 5âyear data of a certified prostate cancer center (PKZ) in terms of urethral strictures.  Materials and methods:   Between 01/2008 and 12/2012 a total of 519 men were irradiated for prostate cancer (LDR and HDR brachytherapy as well as external beam radiation). The entire cohort was followed-up prospectively according to a standardized protocol (by type of irradiation). Short segment urethral strictures were treated by urethrotomy, recurrent and long segment stenosis with buccal mucosa urethroplasty.  Results:   A total of 18 of 519 (3.4%) patients developed a urethral stricture post-therapeutically, which recurred in 66% of cases after the first operative treatment. The largest risk for developing a urethral stricture is attributed to the HDR brachytherapy (8.9%).  Conclusion:   Urethral strictures after prostate cancer radiotherapy should be diagnosed and treated in time for long-term preservation of renal function. The rate of radiogenic urethral strictures (3.4%) is equivalent to those after radical prostatectomy.

The data indicated that suppression of RGS2 gene in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells, in part, due to accumulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1) at the promoter region of RGS2. Inhibition of HDACs or DNMTs significantly increases RGS2 expression. These results suggest that epigenetic changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation may contribute to the loss of RGS2 expression in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. The results further suggest that class I HDACs and DNMT1 contribute to the suppression of RGS2 during acquired chemoresistance and support growing evidence that inhibition of HDACs/DNMTs represents novel therapeutic approaches to overcome ovarian cancer chemoresistance.""","""['Ercan Cacan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Chemother""","""['Inhibition of HDAC1 and DNMT1 modulate RGS10 expression and decrease ovarian cancer chemoresistance.', 'Histone Deacetylase-1-mediated Suppression of FAS in Chemoresistant Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Epigenetic repression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Cellular deficiency in the RGS10 protein facilitates chemoresistant ovarian cancer.', 'Targeted epigenetic therapy of cancer.

Factors that lead to DNA double-strand breaks, such as oxidative stress, may promote the formation of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer. We tested the hypothesis that increasing levels of pre-diagnostic circulating antioxidants, which may reduce oxidative stress, are associated with lower risk of developing TMPRSS2:ERG positive prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study, including 370 cases and 2,470 controls, to evaluate associations between pre-diagnostic Î±- and Î²-carotene, Î±- and Î³-tocopherol, Î²-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, retinol, and selenium with the risk of prostate cancer by ERG protein expression status (a marker of TMPRSS2:ERG). Multivariable unconditional polytomous logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   We did not find any of the antioxidants to be significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer according to ERG status.  Conclusions:   The results do not support the hypothesis that circulating pre-diagnostic antioxidant levels protect against developing TMPRSS2:ERG positive prostate cancer.

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies of zinc administration have provided contradicting results. In order to examine the impact of the artificial intracellular increase of zinc(II) ions on prostate cancer metabolism, PNT1A, 22Rv1, and PC-3 prostatic cell lines-depicting different stages of cancer progression-and their zinc-resistant counterparts were used. To determine ""benign"" and ""malignant"" metabolic profiles, amino acid patterns, gene expression, and antioxidant capacity of these cell lines were assessed.  Methods:   Amino acid profiles were examined using an ion-exchange liquid chromatography. Intracellular zinc content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Metallothionein was quantified using differential pulse voltammetry. The content of reduced glutathione was determined using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector. Cellular antioxidant capacity was determined by the ABTS test and gene expression analysis was performed by qRT-PCR.  Results and conclusions:   Long-term zinc treatment was shown to reroute cell metabolism from benign to more malignant type. Long-term application of high concentration of zinc(II) significantly enhanced cisplatin resistance, invasiveness, cellular antioxidant capacity, synthesis of glutathione, and expression of treatment resistance- and stemness-associated genes (SOX2, POU5F1, BIRC5). Tumorous cell lines universally displayed high accumulation of aspartate and sarcosine and depletion of essential amino acids. Increased aspartate/threonine, aspartate/methionine, and sarcosine/serine ratios were associated with cancer phenotype with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Prostate 77: 604-616, 2017.

Patients and methods:   All patients undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) since the year 2000 at a single tertiary care center were evaluated. A total of 154 patients with pN1 PCa were treated with wpRT (39 in an adjuvant setting) and 2-3 years of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), clinical progression-free survival (cPFS), and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS). Uni- and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors.  Results:   Estimated bRFS was 67%, cPFS was 71%, and CSS was 96% at 5 years. Median follow-up was 55 months (interquartile range 25-87). Multivariate analysis identified having only 1 positive lymph node, a shorter time between diagnosis and PLND, and older age as independent favorable prognostic factors for biochemical and clinical recurrence. The number of positive lymph nodes was prognostic for CSS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.54) and OS (HR 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.36). Bone metastases were the most frequent location of PCa relapse (n = 32, 64%).  Conclusions:   Patients with pN1 PCa treated with wpRT and 2-3 years ADT have an encouraging 5âyear CSS.

Although miR-146a acts as a tumor suppressor, current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that controls its expression in PCa is limited. In this study, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed negatively enriched expression of miR-146a target gene sets and positively enriched expression of gene sets suppressed by the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) after YY1 depletion in PCa cells. The current results demonstrated that the miR-146a levels in PCa tissues with high Gleason scores (>7) are significantly lower than those in PCa tissues with low Gleason scores (â¤7), which were initially observed in the clinical specimens. An inverse relationship between YY1 and miR-146a expression was also observed. Experiments indicated the decrease in cell viability, proliferation, and promoting apoptosis after YY1 depletion, while through inhibiting miR-146a could alleviate the negative effect brought by YY1 depletion. We detected the reversed adjustment of YY1 to accommodate miR-146a transcriptions. On the basis of YY1 depletion, we determined that the expression of miR-146a increased after EZH2 knockdown. We validated the combination of YY1 and its interaction with EZH2 at the miR-146a promoter binding site, thereby prohibiting the transcriptional activity of miR-146a in PCa cells.

We describe and evaluate the application of new technology to detect bacterial and viral agents in high-grade prostate cancer tissues. The potential of targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing and total RNA sequencing was evaluated in terms of its utility to characterise microbial communities within high-grade prostate tumours.  Methods:   Two different Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) approaches were applied. First, to capture and enrich for possible bacterial species, targeted-MPS of the V2-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on DNA extracted from 20 snap-frozen prostate tissue cores from ten ""aggressive"" prostate cancer cases. Second, total RNA extracted from the same prostate tissue samples was also sequenced to capture the sequence profile of both bacterial and viral transcripts present.  Results:   Overall, 16S rRNA sequencing identified Enterobacteriaceae species common to all samples and P. acnes in 95% of analyzed samples. Total RNA sequencing detected endogenous retroviruses providing proof of concept but there was no evidence of bacterial or viral transcripts suggesting active infection, although it does not rule out a previous 'hit and run' scenario.

Smoking affects DNA methylation, in particular the cg05575921 site in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene. We tested the hypothesis that AHRR cg05575921 hypomethylation is associated with risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality.  Methods:   From the Copenhagen City Heart Study representing the Danish general population, we studied 9234 individuals. Using bisulphite treated leucocyte DNA, AHRR (cg05575921) methylation was measured. Rs1051730 (CHRN3A) genotype was used to evaluate smoking heaviness. Participants were followed for up to 22 years for exacerbations of COPD, event of lung cancer and all-cause mortality. Six-year lung cancer risk was calculated according to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCOM2012).  Measurements and main results: AHRR (cg05575921) hypomethylation was associated with former and current smoking status, high daily and cumulative smoking, short time since smoking cessation (all p values <7Ã10-31), and the smoking-related CHRN3A genotype (-0.48% per T-allele, p=0.002). The multifactorially adjusted HRs for the lowest versus highest methylation quintiles were 4.58 (95% CI 2.83 to 7.42) for COPD exacerbations, 4.87 (2.31 to 10.3) for lung cancer and 1.67 (1.48 to 1.88) for all-cause mortality. Finally, among 2576 high-risk smokers eligible for lung cancer screening by CT, observed cumulative incidences of lung cancer after 6 years for individuals in the lowest and highest methylation quintiles were 3.7% and 0.0% (p=2Ã10-7), whereas predicted PLCOM2012 6-year risks were similar (4.3% and 4.4%, p=0.77).

The expression level of Aurora kinase B was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. At the same time, cell apoptosis was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, fluorescent staining, and flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, prostate carcinoma cells were injected into mice to establish a tumor xenograft model. Previous studies have shown the effect of pGPU6-shAURKB plasmid on tumor growth in a prostate carcinoma xenogenic implantation model. From the study, we knew that the Aurora kinase B was significantly downregulated in prostate carcinoma cells, and cell apoptosis was also detected higher in treated groups than that in control groups. Moreover, in the prostate carcinoma xenogenic implantation model, compared with the control groups, the tumor growth was inhibited about 78.7% in the pGPU6-shAURKB plasmid-treated group, and cell apoptosis in the experimental group was notably higher than that in control groups. The average duration of tumor-bearing mice was prolonged to about 35 days. The results of experiment indicated that specific knockdown of Aurora kinase B led to prostate carcinoma cells apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Our data clearly confirmed that specific knockdown of Aurora kinase B expression by vector-based short hairpin RNA/liposome may be a potential new approach to treat human prostatic carcinoma.""","""['Mei Cao', 'Panpan Qi', 'Chong Chen', 'Liju Song', 'Xuege Wang', 'Ningzhe Li', 'Daoyan Wu', 'Guoku Hu', 'Jian Zhao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Tumor-specific RNA interference targeting Pokemon suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of gene GSTP1 silencing via shRNA transfection on androgen independent prostate cancer cell line Du145.', 'A vector-based short hairpin RNA targeting Aurora A inhibits breast cancer growth.', 'Inhibitory effect of silencing STAT3 gene with short hairpin RNA mediated by polyamidoamine dendrimers on growth of prostate cancer.', 'The research progress of Aurora-B kinase and its inhibitors.']"""

SOX9, a key regulator of developmental processes, is overexpressed in various neoplasms, such as prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers. However, the utilization of SOX9 as a biomarker for other urological cancers has not yet been investigated.  Methods:   In the present study, paired patient tissue microarrays were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the SOX9 protein expression was quantitated as immunoreactive scores in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer (BCa), and penile cancer (PC).  Results:   In comparison with normal tissues, SOX9 protein expression was signiï¬cantly upregulated in RCC (p < 0.001) and BCa (p < 0.001), and significantly correlated with the advanced pathological grade (RCC: p = 0.023) and clinical stage (RCC: p = 0.022 and BCa: p = 0.046) of patients. Based on the mRNA level in the TCGA dataset, SOX9 was upregulated in RCC with gender (p = 0.027), advanced pathological grade (p = 0.003) and advanced clinical stage (p = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that RCC patients with high SOX9 levels had shorter survival (p < 0.001). Further, high SOX9 expression was an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients (hazard ratio 0.056, 95% confidence interval 0.607-1.184; p < 0.001).

Objective:   To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers.  Design and setting:   Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined.  Exposure:   County of residence.  Main outcomes and measures:   Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type.  Results:   A total of 19 511 910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5 656 423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2 484 476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1 573 593 due to breast cancer; 1 077 030 due to prostate cancer; 1 157 878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209 314 due to uterine cancer; 421 628 due to kidney cancer; 487 518 due to liver cancer; 13 927 due to testicular cancer; and 829 396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%-21.4%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100 000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100 000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois.  Conclusions and relevance:   Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving prevention and treatment.""","""['Ali H Mokdad', 'Laura Dwyer-Lindgren', 'Christina Fitzmaurice', 'Rebecca W Stubbs', 'Amelia Bertozzi-Villa', 'Chloe Morozoff', 'Raghid Charara', 'Christine Allen', 'Mohsen Naghavi', 'Christopher J L Murray']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JAMA""","""['Translating Cancer Surveillance Data Into Effective Public Health Interventions.', 'Outlier in Analysis of Cancer Mortality by US County.', 'Trends and Patterns of Differences in Chronic Respiratory Disease Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.', 'Trends and Patterns of Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.', 'Trends and Patterns of Differences in Infectious Disease Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Lung and Colorectal Cancer Disparities in Appalachian Kentucky: Spatial Analysis on the Influence of Education and Literacy.', 'Investigation of Geographical Disparities: The Use of An Interpolation Method For Cancer Registry Data.', 'The special sauce of the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network: 20\xa0years of lessons learned in developing the evidence base, building community capacity, and translating research into practice.', 'Colorectal Cancer Screening in Rural and Urban Primary Care Practices Amid Implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act.', 'CCL19/CCR7 drives regulatory T cell migration and indicates poor prognosis in gastric cancer.']"""

The effectiveness of the Î²-radiation emitted by 188Re might be enhanced by combination with chemotherapy, using the radiosensitization concept. Therefore, the authors investigated the combined treatment of the taxanes, docetaxel and cabazitaxel, with 188Re in prostate carcinoma cell lines.  Materials and methods:   The cytotoxic effects of single and combined treatment with taxanes and 188Re were investigated in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3, DU 145, and LNCaP), using the colony-forming assay. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of all individual agents was determined. The combined treatment was studied at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times the EC50 of each agent. The interaction was investigated with a regression model.  Results:   The survival curves showed dose-dependent cell growth inhibition for both the taxanes and 188Re. The regression model showed a good capability of explaining the data. It proved additivity in all combination experiments and confirmed a general trend to a slight subadditive effect.  Conclusions:   This proof-of-mechanism study exploring radiosensitization by combining 188Re and taxanes showed no synergism, but significant additivity. This encourages the design of in vivo studies.

Associations with other cancers are not established. The authors systematically assessed associations between HCV infection and cancers in the US elderly population.  Methods:   This was a registry-based case-control study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data in US adults aged â¥66 years. Cases (n = 1,623,538) were patients who had first cancers identified in SEER registries (1993-2011). Controls (n = 200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free individuals who were frequency-matched to cases on age, sex, race, and calendar year. Associations with HCV (documented by Medicare claims) were determined using logistic regression.  Results:   HCV prevalence was higher in cases than in controls (0.7% vs 0.5%). HCV was positively associated with cancers of the liver (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 31.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.0-34.3), intrahepatic bile duct (aOR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.52-4.58), extrahepatic bile duct (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.41-2.57), pancreas (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.40), and anus (aOR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.42-2.73); nonmelanoma nonepithelial skin cancer (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.15-2.04); myelodysplastic syndrome (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.33-1.83); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.34-1.84). Specific skin cancers associated with HCV were Merkel cell carcinoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30-2.85) and appendageal skin cancers (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.29-3.16). Inverse associations were observed with uterine cancer (aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80) and prostate cancer (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82). Associations were maintained in sensitivity analyses conducted among individuals without documented alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus infections and after adjustment for socioeconomic status. Associations of HCV with other cancers were not observed.  Conclusions:   HCV is associated with increased risk of cancers other than HCC in the US elderly population, notably bile duct cancers and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

In brief, mice are anesthetized using injectable drugs and are made to lay in the dorsal position. Urine is vacated from the bladder and 50 ÂµL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) is slowly instilled at a rate of 10 ÂµL/20 s using a 24 G IV catheter. It is left in the bladder for 20 min by stoppering the catheter. The catheter is removed and PLL is vacated by gentle pressure on the bladder. This is followed by instillation of the murine bladder cancer cell line (1 x 105 cells/50 ÂµL) at a rate of 10 ÂµL/20 s. The catheter is stoppered to prevent premature evacuation. After 1 h, the mice are revived with a reversal drug, and the bladder is vacated. The slow instillation rate is important, as it reduces vesico-ureteral reflux, which can cause tumors to occur in the upper urinary tract and in the kidneys. The cell line should be well re-suspended to reduce clumping of cells, as this can lead to uneven tumor sizes after implantation. This technique induces tumors with high efficiency. Tumor growth is monitored by urinary PSA secretion. PSA marker monitoring is more reliable than ultrasound or fluorescence imaging for the detection of the presence of tumors in the bladder. Tumors in mice generally reach a maximum size that negatively impacts health by about 3 - 4 weeks if left untreated. By monitoring tumor growth, it is possible to differentiate mice that were cured from those that were not successfully implanted with tumors.

A UCF DNA integrity analysis is proposed on the basis of four quantitative real-time PCRs of four sequences longer than 250 bp: c-MYC, BCAS1, HER2, and AR. Sequences that frequently have an increased DNA copy number in bladder and prostate cancers were chosen for the analysis, but the method is flexible, and these genes could be substituted with other genes of interest. The potential utility of UCF DNA as a source of biomarkers has already been demonstrated for urologic malignancies, thus paving the way for further studies on UCF DNA characterization.

This usage is under scrutiny due to the fact that elevated PSA levels can be caused by other conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and infections of or injury to the prostate. As a result, the identification of specific pathogens capable of increasing serum levels of PSA is important. A potential candidate responsible for elevated PSA is human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). We have reported previously that HHV-8 is capable of infecting and establishing a latent infection in the prostate. In this current study we test the hypothesis that HHV-8 infection is associated with elevated PSA levels. Circulating cytokine levels between men with elevated PSA and controls are also compared.  Methods:   HHV-8 serostatus was determined among men with elevated serum PSA (â¥4 ng/ml; n = 168, no prostate cancer on biopsy) and age-matched controls (PSA <4 ng/ml; n = 234), Circulating cytokine levels were determined among a subset of each group (116 with elevated PSA and 85 controls).  Results:   Men with an elevated serum PSA were significantly more likely to be HHV-8 seropositive (42.9%) than the age-matched cancer-free men (22.2%; OR 2.51; 95%CI 1.48-4.29, P = 00001). Comparison of circulating cytokine levels between men with elevated serum PSA and controls indicated that elevated serum PSA is associated with a pro-inflammatory response with a mixed Th1/Th2 response while HHV-8 infection was associated with significantly higher levels of IL12p70, IL-10, and IL-13 indicating a Th2 immune response.  Conclusions:   We found a significant association between HHV-8 infection and increased levels of serum PSA. In an age of patient-centered medicine, men with an elevated serum PSA should be considered for HHV-8 serology testing to determine if HHV-8 is responsible for the elevated PSA.

The impact of phi testing in the real-world clinical setting has not been previously assessed.  Methods:   In a single, large, academic center, phi was tested in 345 patients presenting for diagnostic evaluation for PCa. Findings on prostate biopsy (including Grade Group (GG), defined as GG1: Gleason score (GS) 6, GG2: GS 3+4=7, GG3: GS 4+3=7, GG4: GS 8 and GG5: GS 9-10), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radical prostatectomy (RP) were prospectively recorded. Biopsy rates and outcomes were compared with a contemporary cohort that did not undergo phi testing (n=1318).  Results:   Overall, 39% of men with phi testing underwent prostate biopsy. No men with phi<19.6 were diagnosed with PCa, and only three men with phi<27 had cancer of GGâ©¾2. Phi was superior to PSA for the prediction of any PCa (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.72 vs 0.47) and GGâ©¾2 PCa (AUC 0.77 vs 0.53) on prostate biopsy. Among men undergoing MRI and phi, no men with phi<27 and PI-RADSâ©½3 had GGâ©¾2 cancer. For those men proceeding to RP, increasing phi was associated with higher pathologic GG (P=0.002) and stage (P=0.001). Compared with patients who did not undergo phi testing, the use of phi was associated with a 9% reduction in the rate of prostate biopsy (39% vs 48%; P<0.001). Importantly, the reduction in biopsy among the phi population was secondary to decreased incidence of negative (8%) and GG1 (1%) biopsies, whereas the proportion of biopsies detecting GGâ©¾2 cancers remained unchanged.  Conclusions:   In this large, real-time clinical experience, phi outperformed PSA alone, was associated with high-grade PCa, and provided complementary information to MRI. Incorporation of phi into clinical practice reduced the rate of unnecessary biopsies without changing the frequency of detection of higher-grade cancers.""","""['J J Tosoian', 'S C Druskin', 'D Andreas', 'P Mullane', 'M Chappidi', 'S Joo', 'K Ghabili', 'J Agostino', 'K J Macura', 'H B Carter', 'E M Schaeffer', 'A W Partin', 'L J Sokoll', 'A E Ross']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Combining Prostate Health Index density, magnetic resonance imaging and prior negative biopsy status to improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of pathological stage based on clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen, and biopsy Gleason score: Partin Tables in the contemporary era.', 'Prostate Health Index (PHI) improves prostate cancer detection at initial biopsy in Taiwanese men with PSA 4-10\xa0ng/mL.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Comparison of Prostate-Specific Antigen and Its Density and Prostate Health Index and Its Density for Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate health index (PHI) as an accurate prostate cancer predictor.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Clinical Utility of Prostate Health Index for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with PI-RADS 3 Lesions.']"""

PSA level is the most widely used parameter for disease monitoring, but it has well-recognized limitations. Unlike in clinical trials, in practice, clinicians may rely on PSA monitoring alone to determine disease status on therapy. This approach has not been adequately tested.  Methods:   Chemotherapy-naive asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic men (n=872) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated with the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in the PREVAIL study were analyzed post hoc for rising versus nonrising PSA (empirically defined as >1.05 vs â©½1.05 times the PSA level from 3 months earlier) at the time of radiographic progression. Clinical characteristics and disease outcomes were compared between the rising and nonrising PSA groups.  Results:   Of 265 PREVAIL patients with radiographic progression and evaluable PSA levels on the enzalutamide arm, nearly one-quarter had a nonrising PSA. Median progression-free survival in this cohort was 8.3 months versus 11.1 months in the rising PSA cohort (hazard ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.23); overall survival was similar between the two groups, although less than half of patients in either group were still at risk at 24 months. Baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar.  Conclusions:   Non-rising PSA at radiographic progression is a common phenomenon in mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide. As restaging in advanced prostate cancer patients is often guided by increases in PSA levels, our results demonstrate that disease progression on enzalutamide can occur without rising PSA levels. Therefore, a disease monitoring strategy that includes imaging not entirely reliant on serial serum PSA measurement may more accurately identify disease progression.""","""['A H Bryce', 'J J Alumkal', 'A Armstrong', 'C S Higano', 'P Iversen', 'C N Sternberg', 'D Rathkopf', 'Y Loriot', 'J de Bono', 'B Tombal', 'S Abhyankar', 'P Lin', 'A Krivoshik', 'D Phung', 'T M Beer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prognostic Association of Prostate-specific Antigen Decline with Clinical Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide in a Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Post hoc analyses of East Asian patients from the randomized placebo-controlled PREVAIL trial of enzalutamide in patients with chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy outcomes by baseline prostate-specific antigen quartile in the AFFIRM trial.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in human samples might have a potential role of predicting prostate cancer recurrence and progression after surgery and hormonal therapy.', 'Towards clinical implementation of circulating tumor DNA in metastatic prostate cancer: Opportunities for integration and pitfalls to interpretation.', 'Characteristics of BRCA2 Mutated Prostate Cancer at Presentation.', 'Correlation Between Imaging-Based Intermediate Endpoints and Overall Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of 28 Randomized Trials Using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) Criteria in 16,511 Patients.', 'Impact of Serum Î³-Glutamyltransferase on Overall Survival in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Docetaxel.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed a single-surgeon experience of transrectal prostate biopsies from 2010 to 2014. Biopsies were performed in either an operative suite, where 10% formalin was used to disinfect the needle tip between each biopsy core, or an outpatient clinic, where formalin was not used. Our primary outcome was post-biopsy UTI rates, defined as a positive urine culture within 30 days of biopsy. Infection severity was characterized by the need for admission. Patient demographics, prostate size, prior biopsies, prior UTIs, pre-biopsy antibiotics and cultures and post-biopsy cultures were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of post-biopsy UTIs. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.  Results:   A total of 756 patients were included for analysis, including 253 who received formalin disinfection and 503 who did not. Of these, 32 patients (4.2%) experienced post-biopsy UTIs, with 8 requiring admission (all without formalin use). Infection rates were more than double in the group that did not receive formalin (5.2% vs 2.3%, P=0.085). More patients in the formalin group had undergone prior biopsies (73.9% vs 31.8%, P<0.001). On multivariable analysis, prior UTI (odds ratio (OR) 3.77, P=0.006) was a significant predictor for post-biopsy infection, whereas formalin disinfection trended towards a protective effect (OR 0.41, P=0.055).

Methods:   We studied 100 patients with intermediate-risk (55%) and high-risk (45%) prostate cancer who received definitive radiation plus a median of 6 months of ADT (range 3-39 months) from 2001-2013 at a single center and had available biopsy tissue. Six to ten 4 micron sections of the needle biopsy core with the highest Gleason score and percentage of tumor involvement were macrodissected for RNA extraction. GC scores (range, 0.04-0.92) were determined. The primary end point of the study was time to distant metastasis. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. There were 18 metastases during the study period.  Results:   On univariable analysis (UVA), each 0.1 unit increase in GC score was significantly associated with time to distant metastasis (hazard ratio: 1.40 (1.10-1.84), P=0.006) and remained significant after adjusting for clinical variables on multivariable analysis (MVA) (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.36 (1.04-1.83), P=0.024). The c-index for 5-year distant metastasis was 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.64) for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, 0.63 (0.40-0.78) for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk groups, and 0.76 (0.57-0.89) for the GC score. Using pre-specified GC risk categories, the cumulative incidence of metastasis for GC>0.6 reached 20% at 5 years after radiation (P=0.02).  Conclusions:   We believe this is the first demonstration of the ability of the biopsy-based GC score to predict for distant metastases after definitive radiation and ADT for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.

We investigated the impact that PSA doubling time (DT) and comorbidity had on the risk of all-cause mortality (ACM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) following PSA failure.  Methods:   Between 1995 and 2001, 206 men with unfavorable-risk PC were randomized to receive radiation therapy alone or in combination with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); 108 men experienced PSA failure and formed the study cohort. Cox and Fine-Gray regression analysis was used to determine whether PSA DT was associated with the risk of ACM and PCSM/OCM, respectively, stratified by comorbidity status using a validated metric.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 13.71 years following PSA failure, 81 of the 108 men (75%) died. Longer PSA DT was associated with a decreased risk of PCSM in men with no/minimal (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.65, P=0.001) and moderate/severe comorbidity (AHR 0.014, 95% CI 0.002-0.129, P=0.0002). However, because of the different contributions of the risk of OCM to risk of ACM within comorbidity subgroups, increasing PSA DT was only associated with a decreased risk of ACM in men with no/minimal (AHR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96, P=0.03) but not moderate/severe comorbidity (AHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51-1.78, P=0.87).

Methods:   Clinical, pathologic, and oncological outcome data were collected from our prospectively collected MIRP database to estimate positive surgical margin (PSM) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) trends during a 15-year period from 1998 to 2013. All the radical prostatectomies (laparoscopic prostatectomy [LRP]/robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy [RARP]) were performed by 9 surgeons. PSM was defined as presence of cancer cells at inked margins. BCR was defined as serum prostate-specific antigen >0.2ng/ml and rising or start of secondary therapy. Surgical learning curve was assessed with the application of Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression model, cumulative summation, and logistic model to define the ""transition point"" of surgical improvement.  Results:   We identified 5,547 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with MIRP (3,846 LRP and 1,701 RARP). Patient characteristics of LRP and RARP were similar. The overall risk of PSM in LRP was 25%, 20%, and 17% for the first 50, 50 to 350, and>350 cases, respectively. For the same population, the 5-year BCR rate decreased from 30% to 16.7%. RARP started 3 years after the LRP program (after approximately 250 LRP). The PSM rate for RARP decreased from 21.8% to 20.4% and the corresponding 5-year BCR rate decreased from 17.6% to 7.9%. The cumulative summation analysis showed significantly lower PSM and BCR at 2 years occurred at the transition point of 350 cases for LRP and 100 cases for RARP. In multivariable analysis, predictors of BCR were prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, extraprostatic disease, seminal vesicle invasion, and number of operations (P<0.05). Patients harboring PSM showed higher BCR risk (23% vs. 8%, P< 0.05).  Conclusions:   Learning curve trends in our large, single-center experience show correlation between surgical experience and oncological outcomes in MIRP.

It is unclear, however, how to integrate small Gleason 5 elements into clinically relevant Gleason grade groups.  Objective:   To analyze the prognostic impact of Gleason 5 patterns in prostate cancer and to develop a method for integrating tertiary Gleason 5 patterns into a quantitative Gleason grading system.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prostatectomy specimens from 13 261 consecutive patients and of 3295 matched preoperative biopsies were available. Percentages of Gleason 3, 4, and 5 had been recorded for each cancer. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Our data demonstrate that minimal Gleason 5 areas have strong prognostic impact in Gleason 7 carcinomas, while further expansion of the Gleason 5 pattern population has less impact. We thus defined an integrated quantitative Gleason score (IQ-Gleason) by adding a lump score of 10 to the percentage of unfavorable Gleason pattern (Gleason 4/5) if any Gleason 5 was present and by adding another 7.5 points in case of a Gleason 5 fraction >20%. There was a continuous increase of the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence with increasing IQ-Gleason. This was also true for subgroups with identical Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical scores (p<0.0001) or Gleason grade groups (p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   The IQ-Gleason represents a simple and efficient approach for combining both quantitative Gleason grading and tertiary Gleason grades in one highly prognostic numerical variable.  Patient summary:   Prostatectomy specimens (13 261) were analyzed to estimate the relevance of small Gleason 5 elements in prostate cancers. Even the smallest Gleason 5 areas markedly increased the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after surgery. Larger fractions of Gleason 5 patterns had less further impact on prognosis. Based on this, a numerical Gleason score (integrated quantitative Gleason score) was defined by the percentages of Gleason 4 and 5 patterns, enabling a refined estimate of patient prognosis.""","""['Guido Sauter', 'Till Clauditz', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Franziska BÃ¼scheck', 'Till Krech', 'Florian Lutz', 'Maximilian Lennartz', 'Luisa Harms', 'Lisa Lawrenz', 'Christina MÃ¶ller-Koop', 'Ronald Simon', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Sarah Minner', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Viktoria Chirico', 'SÃ¶ren Weidemann', 'Alexander Haese', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Georg Salomon', 'Michael Matiu', 'Eik Vettorazzi', 'Uwe Michl', 'Lars BudÃ¤us', 'Derya Tilki', 'Imke Thederan', 'Dirk Pehrke', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Cosima GÃ¶bel', 'Marie Heinrich', 'Manuela Juhnke', 'Katharina MÃ¶ller', 'Ahmed Abdulwahab Abdullah Bawahab', 'Ria Uhlig', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Markus Graefen', 'Thorsten Schlomm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['From Gleason Grading System and High-grade Tertiary Patterns to Grade Groups and Integrated Quantitative Gleason Score.', 'Clinical Utility of Quantitative Gleason Grading in Prostate Biopsies and Prostatectomy Specimens.', 'Limitations in Predicting Organ Confined Prostate Cancer in Patients with Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Factors predicting prostatic biopsy Gleason sum under grading.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'An Apparent Diffusion Coefficient-Based Machine Learning Model Can Improve Prostate Cancer Detection in the Grey Area of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 3: A Single-Centre Experience.', 'AI-based prostate analysis system trained without human supervision to predict patient outcome from tissue samples.', 'AI Model for Prostate Biopsies Predicts Cancer Survival.', 'Predicting prostate cancer specific-mortality with artificial intelligence-based Gleason grading.', 'PITX1 Is a Regulator of TERT Expression in Prostate Cancer with Prognostic Power.']"""

This paper presents the clinical workflow, quality assurance program, and reports the geometric and dosimetric results of the first patient cohort treated with DWA.  Methods and materials:   The RayStation TPS was clinically integrated on the Vero SBRT platform for DWA treatments. The first 15 patients treated with DWA represent a broad range of treatment sites: breast boost, prostate, lung SBRT and bone metastases, which allowed us to explore the potentials and assess the limitations of the current DWA site-specific template solution. For the DWA verification a variety of QA equipment was used, from 3D diode array to an anthropomorphic end-to-end phantom. The geometric accuracy of each arc was verified with an independent orthogonal fluoroscopy method.  Results:   The average beam-on delivery time was 3min, ranging from 1.22min to 8.82min. All patient QAs passed our institutional clinical criteria of gamma index. For both EBT3 film and Delta4 measurements, DWA planned versus delivered dose distributions presented an average agreement above 97%.

Low-dose brachytherapy is an increasingly used treatment for PCa, which requires the implantation of tens of radioactive seeds. This treatment causes discomfort; these implants cannot be removed, and they generate image artifacts. In this study, the authors report on intratumoral injections of radioactive gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as an alternative to seeds. The particles (103 Pd:Pd@Au-PEG and 103 Pd:Pd@198 Au:Au-PEG; 10-14 nm Pd@Au core, 36-48 nm hydrodynamic diameter) are synthesized by a one-pot process and characterized by electron microscopy. Administrated as low volume (2-4 ÂµL) single doses (1.6-1.7 mCi), the particles are strongly retained in PCa xenograft tumors, impacting on their growth rate. After 4 weeks, a tumor volume inhibition of 56% and of 75%, compared to the controls, is observed for 103 Pd:Pd@Au-PEG NPs and 103 Pd:Pd@198 Au:Au-PEG NPs, respectively. Skin necrosis is observed with 198 Au; therefore, Au NPs labeled with 103 Pd only are a more advisable choice. Overall, this is the first study confirming the impact of 103 Pd@Au NPs on tumor growth. This new brachytherapy procedure could allow tunable doses of radioactivity, administered with smaller needles than with the current technologies, and leading to fewer image artifacts.""","""['Myriam Laprise-Pelletier', 'Jean Lagueux', 'Marie-France CÃ´tÃ©', 'Thomas LaGrange', 'Marc-AndrÃ© Fortin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Healthc Mater""","""['Intratumoral Injection of Low-Energy Photon-Emitting Gold Nanoparticles: A Microdosimetric Monte Carlo-Based Model.', 'Rapid, one-pot procedure to synthesise 103Pd:Pd@Au nanoparticles en route for radiosensitisation and radiotherapeutic applications.', 'In silico dosimetry of low-dose rate brachytherapy using radioactive nanoparticles.', 'Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

Here, we examined genome-wide measures of peripheral blood DNA methylation in prostate cancer and its non-aggressive and aggressive disease forms.  Methods:   We used a matched, case-control study of 687 incident prostate cancer samples, nested within a larger prospective cohort study. DNA methylation was measured in pre-diagnostic, peripheral blood samples using the Illumina Infinium HM450K BeadChip. Genome-wide measures of DNA methylation were computed as the median M-value of all CpG sites and according to CpG site location and regulatory function. We used conditional logistic regression to test for associations between genome-wide measures of DNA methylation and risk of prostate cancer and its subtypes, and by time between blood draw and diagnosis.  Results:   We observed no associations between the genome-wide measure of DNA methylation based on all CpG sites and risk of prostate cancer or aggressive disease. Risk of non-aggressive disease was associated with higher methylation of CpG islands (OR = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.68-0.94), promoter regions (OR = 0.79; 95%CI = 0.66-0.93), and high density CpG regions (OR = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.68-0.94). Additionally, higher methylation of all CpGs (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.48-0.89), CpG shores (OR = 0.62; 95%CI = 0.45-0.84), and regulatory regions (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.51-0.91) was associated with a reduced risk of overall prostate cancer within 5 years of blood draw but not thereafter.  Conclusions:   A reduced risk of overall prostate cancer within 5 years of blood draw and non-aggressive prostate cancer was associated with higher genome-wide methylation of peripheral blood DNA.

To dissect the mechanism of androgen resistance, we utilize a proteomics approach to study the development of androgen resistance in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Our results showed the predominant involvement of metabolic pathways that were elevated in androgen resistance phenotype. We further found the amplification of PI3K/AKT pathway and the overexpression of proteasome proteins while the mitochondrial oxidation phosphorylation was severely hampered in castration-resistant LNCaP-95 cells compared to LNCaP cells. Interestingly, we also found the induction of Dicer, a cytoplasmic endoribonuclease microRNA regulator in the androgen-ablated LNCaP-95 prostate cancer cells. We verified some of these data by orthogonal methods including Western blot analysis and in castrated animal xenograft studies.

Material and methods:   Total of 48 patients with mean &plusmn; SD age of 64.5 &plusmn; 6.0 years who had undergone TURPprior to RP were included. Thirty-one (64.58%) patients underwent robotic RP (group I) and 17 patients underwentopen RP (group II). Variables evaluated included demographic characteristics, perioperative complications, functionaland oncological outcomes. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a detectable level of serum PSAafter RP. Continence was defined as being pad free and potency as erection with or without medication enough forpenetration.  Results:   All patients had undetectable PSA after RP. Four patients (12.9%) from group I and 2 patients (11.8%)from group II had positive margins (P = .9). The rates of continence were 70% and 80.81% for group I and groupII respectively (P = .47).

There are four mammalian activin subunits (Î²A, Î²B, Î²C, and Î²E) that dimerize to form functional proteins. The role of activin-A (Î²A-Î²A) has been relatively well characterized and has been shown to generally inhibit growth in the prostate. In contrast, little is known about the biological function of the Î²C and Î²E subunits. Previous work indicated activin-C (Î²C-Î²C) to be an antagonist of activin-A. This is important because resistance to activin-A growth inhibition occurs during prostate cancer progression. This paradox is not currently well understood. Hence, we hypothesize that local expression of the activin-Î²C subunit antagonizes activin-A-dependent growth inhibition and represents a key factor contributing to acquired insensitivity to activin-A observed in prostate cancer progression. To test our hypothesis, we characterized the ventral prostate lobes of 9-month-old transgenic mice over-expressing activin-Î²C and examined the expression of activin-Î²A, activin-Î²C, and the activin intracellular signaling factor, Smad-2, in human prostate diseases. Prostate epithelial cell hyperplasia, low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, alterations in cell proliferation, and reduced Smad-2 nuclear localization were evident in mice over-expressing activin-Î²C. Increased activin-Î²A and -Î²C subunit immunoreactive scores and decreased Smad-2 nuclear localization were also evident in human prostate cancer. This study suggests that over-expression of activin-Î²C is associated with murine and human prostate pathologies. We conclude that the activin-Î²C subunit may have therapeutic and/or diagnostic implications in human prostate disease.""","""['Edward C Ottley', 'Karen L Reader', 'Kailun Lee', 'Francesco E Marino', 'Helen D Nicholson', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Elspeth Gold']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Activin betaC-subunit heterodimers provide a new mechanism of regulating activin levels in the prostate.', 'Beta A versus beta B: is it merely a matter of expression?', 'Activin C antagonizes activin A in vitro and overexpression leads to pathologies in vivo.', 'Regional localization of activin-Î²A, activin-Î²C, follistatin, proliferation, and apoptosis in adult and developing mouse prostate ducts.', 'Should activin betaC be more than a fading snapshot in the activin/TGFbeta family album?', 'Activin B and Activin C Have Opposing Effects on Prostate Cancer Progression and Cell Growth.']"""

However, extensive first-pass metabolism following oral lignan consumption results in their systemic availability primarily as glucuronic acid conjugates (ENL-Gluc) and their modest in vivo effects. To overcome the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and improve their effectiveness in prostate cancer, antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) might offer a novel strategy to allow for restricted activation of ENL from circulating ENL-Gluc within the tumor environment. The anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody D7 was fused with human Î²-glucuronidase (hÎ²G) via a flexible linker. The binding property of the fusion construct, D7-hÎ²G, against purified or cell surface PSMA was determined by flow cytometry and Octet Red 384 system, respectively, with a binding rate constant, K d, of 2.5 nM. The enzymatic activity of D7-hÎ²G was first tested using the probe, 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide. A 3.8-fold greater fluorescence intensity was observed at pH 4.5 at 2 h compared with pH 7.4. The ability of D7-hÎ²G to activate ENL from ENL-Gluc was tested and detected using LC-MS/MS. Enhanced generation of ENL was observed with increasing ENL-Gluc concentrations and reached 3613.2 ng/mL following incubation with 100 Î¼M ENL-Gluc at pH 4.5 for 0.5 h. D7-hÎ²G also decreased docetaxel IC50 value from 23 nM to 14.9 nM in C4-2 cells.

To explore the AR axis in MCL, we evaluated AR expression in MCL cell lines and human tumors, and tested the impact of androgen pathway inhibition on MCL proliferation. AR transcript levels ranged up to ~26 fold higher in MCL lines vs non-MCL NHL lines (p = 0.006) and were correlated with expression of the canonical AR-regulated gene, prostate-specific antigen (PSA; r = 0.715, p = 0.001), consistent with functional AR activity.

PROMs can be assessed through a self-administered survey or by a third party. Use of mixed mode approaches where PROMs are completed using a single or combination of administration method is emerging. The aim of this study is to identify the most cost-effective efficient approach to collecting PROMs among three modes (telephone, postal service/mail and email) in a population-based clinical quality registry monitoring survivorship after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. This is important to assist the registry in achieving representative PROMs capture using the most cost-effective technique and in developing cost projections for national scale-up.  Methods/design:   This study will adopt an equivalence randomised controlled design. Participants are men diagnosed with and/or treated for prostate cancer (PCa) participating in PCOR-VIC and meet the criteria for 12-month follow-up. Participants will be individually randomized to three independent groups: telephone, mail/postal, or email to complete the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) survey. It is estimated each group will have 229 respondents. We will compare the proportion of completed surveys across the three groups. The economic evaluation will be undertaken from the perspective of the data collection centre and consider all operating costs (personnel, supplies, training, operation and maintenance). Cost data will be captured using an Activity Based Costs method. To estimate the most cost-effective approach, we will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A cost projection model will be developed based on most cost-effective approach for nationwide scale-up of the PROMs tool for follow-up of PCa patients in Australia.  Discussion:   This study will identify the most cost-effective approach for collecting PROMs from men with PCa, and enable estimation of costs for national implementation of the PCa PROMs survey.

In particular gene fusion detection and comprehension have been deeply enhanced by these methods. However, state of the art algorithms for gene fusion identification are still challenging. Indeed, they identify huge amounts of poorly overlapping candidates and all the reported fusions should be considered for in lab validation clearly overwhelming wet lab capabilities.  Results:   In this work we propose a novel methodological approach and tool named FuGePrior for the prioritization of gene fusions from paired-end RNA-Seq data. The proposed pipeline combines state of the art tools for chimeric transcript discovery and prioritization, a series of filtering and processing steps designed by considering modern literature on gene fusions and an analysis on functional reliability of gene fusion structure.  Conclusions:   FuGePrior performance has been assessed on two publicly available paired-end RNA-Seq datasets: The first by Edgren and colleagues includes four breast cancer cell lines and a normal breast sample, whereas the second by Ren and colleagues comprises fourteen primary prostate cancer samples and their paired normal counterparts. FuGePrior results accounted for a reduction in the number of fusions output of chimeric transcript discovery tools that ranges from 65 to 75% depending on the considered breast cancer cell line and from 37 to 65% according to the prostate cancer sample under examination. Furthermore, since both datasets come with a partial validation we were able to assess the performance of FuGePrior in correctly prioritizing real gene fusions. Specifically, 25 out of 26 validated fusions in breast cancer dataset have been correctly labelled as reliable and biologically significant.

This study investigated if adenovirus replication in human prostate cancer cells is influenced by host cell miRNA expression. To this end, human miRNA expression in response to adenovirus infection was analyzed, and functional screens for lytic adenovirus replication were performed using synthetic miRNA mimic and inhibitor libraries. Adenovirus infection generally reduced miRNA expression. On top of this nonspecific interference with miRNA biogenesis, a set of miRNAs, including in particular miR-222, was found specifically reduced. Another set of miRNAs was found to promote adenovirus-induced death of prostate cancer cells. In most cases, this did not stimulate adenovirus propagation. The exception was miR-26b. Overexpression of miR-26b inhibited adenovirus-induced NF-ÎºB activation, augmented adenovirus-mediated cell death, increased adenovirus progeny release, and promoted adenovirus propagation and spread in several human prostate cancer cell lines.

Family functioning such as family cohesion and communication may play a primary role in improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of couples, given that cancer can influence family dynamics.  Objective:   The aims of this study were to investigate the mediating effect of family communication on the relationship between family cohesion and HRQOL and examine the moderating effect of sex on this relationship among cancer survivor-spouse dyads.  Methods:   A total of 91 cancer survivors with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer and their spouses were recruited from the University Hospital Registry in Cleveland, Ohio. The dyadic data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with the actor-partner interdependence mediation model.  Results:   Findings demonstrated that the spouses' own perceived family communication mediated the associations between their own family cohesion and physical HRQOL and between the survivors' family cohesion and physical HRQOL. The spouse actor effects between family communication and HRQOL significantly differed by sex.  Conclusions:   Enhancing family cohesion and communication within the family can improve the spouses' HRQOL. Findings regarding sex differences serve as a rationale for gender-based approaches to improving HRQOL in survivorship care in the family context.  Implications for practice:   Couple- and/or family-based interventions should be designed to enhance family cohesion and improve family communication skills for effective adjustments within couples and families.

Med. Biol. 61 2067-82). Scenario-based margins are, in their original form, a method for robust planning under setup uncertainty where the sum of a plan evaluation criterion over a set of scenarios is optimized. The voxelwise penalties in the summands are weighted by a distribution of coefficients defined such that the method is mathematically equivalent to the use of conventional geometric margins if the scenario doses are calculated using the static dose cloud approximation. The purpose of this work is to extend scenario-based margins to general types of geometric uncertainty and to validate their use on clinical cases. Specifically, we outline how to incorporate density heterogeneity in the calculation of coefficients and demonstrate the extended method's ability to safeguard against setup errors, organ motion, and range shifts (and combinations thereof). For a water phantom with a high-density slab partly covering the target, the extended form of scenario-based margins method led to improved target coverage robustness compared to the original method. At most minor differences in robustness were, however, observed between the extended and original method for a prostate and two lung patients, all treated with intensity-modulated proton therapy, yielding evidence that the calculation of weighting coefficients is generally insensitive to tissue heterogeneities. The scenario-based margins were, furthermore, verified to provide a comparable level of robustness to expected value and worst case optimization while circumventing some known shortcomings of these methods.""","""['Rasmus Bokrantz', 'Albin Fredriksson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Impact of respiratory motion on worst-case scenario optimized intensity modulated proton therapy for lung cancers.', 'The scenario-based generalization of radiation therapy margins.', 'Superiority in Robustness of Multifield Optimization Over Single-Field Optimization for Pencil-Beam Proton Therapy for Oropharynx Carcinoma: An Enhanced Robustness Analysis.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Robust optimization of VMAT for prostate cancer accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Retrospective Planning Study of Patients with Superior Sulcus Tumours Comparing Pencil Beam Scanning Protons to Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.']"""

With the aim of localizing angiogenic activity in a non-invasive manner, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (DCE-US) has been widely used. Usually, the passage of ultrasound contrast agents thought the organ of interest is analyzed for the assessment of tissue perfusion. However, the heterogeneous nature of blood flow in angiogenic vasculature hampers the diagnostic effectiveness of perfusion parameters. In this regard, quantification of the heterogeneity of flow may provide a relevant additional feature for localizing angiogenesis. Statistics based on flow magnitude as well as its orientation can be exploited for this purpose. In this paper, we estimate the microbubble velocity fields from a standard bolus injection and provide a first statistical characterization by performing a spatial entropy analysis. By testing the method on 24 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer, we show that the proposed method can be applied effectively to clinically acquired DCE-US data.

However, prostate cancer demonstrates enormous heterogeneity in biological behavior, thus establishing improved prognostic and predictive markers is particularly important to personalize therapy of men with clinically localized and newly diagnosed malignancy. Many automated grading systems have been developed for Gleason grading but acceptance in the medical community has been lacking due to poor interpretability. To overcome this problem, we developed a set of visually meaningful features to differentiate between low- and high-grade prostate cancer. The visually meaningful feature set consists of luminal and architectural features. For luminal features, we compute: 1) the shortest path from the nuclei to their closest luminal spaces; 2) ratio of the epithelial nuclei to the total number of nuclei. A nucleus is considered an epithelial nucleus if the shortest path between it and the luminal space does not contain any other nucleus; 3) average shortest distance of all nuclei to their closest luminal spaces. For architectural features, we compute directional changes in stroma and nuclei using directional filter banks. These features are utilized to create two subspaces; one for prostate images histopathologically assessed as low grade and the other for high grade. The grade associated with a subspace, which results in the minimum reconstruction error is considered as the prediction for the test image. For training, we utilized 43 regions of interest (ROI) images, which were extracted from 25 prostate whole slide images of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. For testing, we utilized an independent dataset of 88 ROIs extracted from 30 prostate whole slide images. The method resulted in 93.0% and 97.6% training and testing accuracies, respectively, for the spectrum of cases considered.

Recently, contrast ultrasound dispersion imaging was proposed as an alternative method for angiogenesis imaging. After the intravenous injection of an ultrasound-contrast-agent bolus, dispersion can be indirectly estimated from the local similarity between neighboring time-intensity curves (TICs) measured by ultrasound imaging. Up until now, only linear similarity measures have been investigated. Motivated by the promising results of this approach in prostate cancer (PCa), we developed a novel dispersion estimation method based on mutual information, thus including nonlinear similarity, to further improve its ability to localize PCa.  Methods:   First, a simulation study was performed to establish the theoretical link between dispersion and mutual information. Next, the method's ability to localize PCa was validated in vivo in 23 patients (58 datasets) referred for radical prostatectomy by comparison with histology.  Results:   A monotonic relationship between dispersion and mutual information was demonstrated. The in vivo study resulted in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area equal to 0.77, which was superior (p = 0.21-0.24) to that obtained by linear similarity measures (0.74-0.75) and (p <; 0.05) to that by conventional perfusion parameters (â¤0.70).  Conclusion:   Mutual information between neighboring time-intensity curves can be used to indirectly estimate contrast dispersion and can lead to more accurate PCa localization.  Significance:   An improved PCa localization method can possibly lead to better grading and staging of tumors, and support focal-treatment guidance.

Challenges associated with manual needle insertion such as needle deflection limit this procedure to primarily treat the entire prostate gland even for patients with localized cancer. In this paper, we present a new semiautomated hand-held needle steering assistant designed to help surgeons improve needle placement accuracy.  Methods:   Regular clinical brachytherapy needles are connected to a compact device that the surgeon holds. As the surgeon inserts the needle, the device rotates the needle base on a measured and calculated basis in order to produce a desired trajectory of the needle tip. A novel needle-tissue interaction model and a steering algorithm calculate such control actions based on ultrasound images of the needle in tissue. The assistant can also apply controlled longitudinal microvibrations to the needle that reduce needle-tissue friction.  Results:   Experimental validation of the proposed system in phantom and ex-vivo biological tissue report an average needle targeting accuracy of 0.33 mm over 72 needle insertions in 12 different experimental scenarios.  Conclusion:   We introduce a new framework for needle steering in prostate brachytherapy in which the surgeon remains in charge of the needle insertion. The device weighs 160 g, making it easy to incorporate with current insertion techniques.

Methods:   A cohort of 293,435 patients based on data from twelve French cancer registries was analyzed. For five first cancer sites, SPC incidence rates were estimated using Poisson regression models. The cumulative risks of SPC were computed for different follow-up times. For comparison purpose, the same method was used to estimate the probability of cancer in the general population.  Results:   In this population-based cohort, 27,320 patients presented with a SPC. The cumulative risk of SPC varied depending on first cancer site, with a 10-year cumulative probability of SPC ranging from 6.2% for women with breast cancer to 44.0% for men with head and neck cancer. Compared with the general population, the 10-year cumulative risk of SPC was dramatically elevated for tobacco-related first cancers, with an increase of +7.3% for men aged 55 to 64 with a first lung cancer and +35.6% for men aged 45 to 54 with a first head and neck cancer. Lower differences were observed among patients diagnosed with a first prostate cancer (+5.5% among men aged 55 to 64), colorectal (+4.1% for women aged 55 to 64 and +6.3% for men aged 55 to 64), and breast (+2.0% among females aged 75 and older) cancers.

The membrane protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) functions here as an important oncogene. Therefore we examined the impact of stromal Cav1 expression for tumor growth and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Silencing of Cav1 expression in PC3 cells resulted in increased tumor growth and a reduced growth delay after IR when compared to tumors generated by Cav1-expressing PC3 cells. The increased radiation resistance was associated with increasing amounts of reactive tumor stroma and a Cav1 re-expression in the malignant epithelial cells. Mimicking the human situation these results were confirmed using co-implantation of Cav1-silenced PC3 cells with Cav1-silenced or Cav1-expressing fibroblasts. Immunohistochemically analysis of irradiated tumors as well as human prostate tissue specimen confirmed that alterations in stromal-epithelial Cav1 expressions were accompanied by a more reactive Cav1-reduced tumor stroma after radiation and within advanced prostate cancer tissues which potentially mediates the resistance to radiation treatment. Conclusively, the radiation response of human prostate tumors is critically regulated by Cav1 expression in stromal fibroblasts. Loss of stromal Cav1 expression in advanced tumor stages may thus contribute to resistance of these tumors to radiotherapy.""","""['Andrej Panic', 'Julia Ketteler', 'Henning Reis', 'Ali Sak', 'Carsten Herskind', 'Patrick Maier', 'Herbert RÃ¼bben', 'Verena Jendrossek', 'Diana Klein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Progression-Related Loss of Stromal Caveolin 1 Levels Mediates Radiation Resistance in Prostate Carcinoma via the Apoptosis Inhibitor TRIAP1.', 'Caveolin-1 regulates the ASMase/ceramide-mediated radiation response of endothelial cells in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.', 'Endothelial Caveolin-1 regulates the radiation response of epithelial prostate tumors.', 'Caveolin-1, cancer and therapy resistance.', 'Caveolin-1, breast cancer and ionizing radiation.', 'Development of a prediction model for radiotherapy response among patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma based on the tumor immune microenvironment and hypoxia signature.', 'Caveolae-Associated Molecules, Tumor Stroma, and Cancer Drug Resistance: Current Findings and Future Perspectives.', 'Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Caveolin-1 is a prognostic marker and suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer.', 'Early senescence and production of senescence-associated cytokines are major determinants of radioresistance in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Conventionally, these measurements are visualized with a one-dimensional color scale, allowing only for one-dimensional information to be encoded. Yet, human perception places visual information in a three-dimensional color space. In theory, each dimension of this space can be utilized to encode visual information. We addressed this issue and developed a new method for tri-variate color-coded visualization of mpMRI data sets. We showed the usefulness of our method in a preclinical and in a clinical setting: In imaging data of a rat model of acute kidney injury, the method yielded characteristic visual patterns. In a clinical data set of N = 13 prostate cancer mpMRI data, we assessed diagnostic performance in a blinded study with N = 5 observers. Compared to conventional radiological evaluation, color-coded visualization was comparable in terms of positive and negative predictive values. Thus, we showed that human observers can successfully make use of the novel method.

Thus, inhibition of HDAC activity has emerged as a potential alternative option for prostate cancer therapy. Chromopeptide A is a depsipeptide isolated from the marine sediment-derived bacterium Chromobacterium sp. HS-13-94; it has a chemical structure highly similar to FK228, a class I HDAC inhibitor that is approved by FDA for treating T-cell lymphoma. In this study, we determined whether chromopeptide A, like FK228, acted as a class I HDAC inhibitor, and whether chromopeptide A could inhibit the growth and migration of human prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. HDAC enzyme selectivity and kinetic analysis revealed that chromopeptide A selectively inhibited the enzymatic activities of HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8 in a substrate non-competitive manner with comparable IC50 values for each HDAC member as FK228 in vitro. Importantly, chromopeptide A dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of human prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP with IC50 values of 2.43Â±0.02, 2.08Â±0.16, and 1.75Â±0.06 nmol/L, respectively, accompanied by dose-dependent inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity in PC3 and DU145 cells. Chromopeptide A (0.2-50 nmol/L) caused G2/M phase arrest and induced apoptosis in the prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, chromopeptide A dose-dependently inhibited the migration of PC3 cells. In mice bearing PC3 prostate cancer xenografts, intravenous injection of chromopeptide A (1.6, 3.2 mg/kg, once a week for 18 d) significantly suppressed the tumor growth, which was associated with increased expression levels of Ac-H3 and p21 in tumor tissues.

Moreover, miR-141 expression enforces a strong epithelial phenotype with a partial loss of mesenchymal phenotype. Whole-genome RNA sequencing uncovers novel miR-141-regulated molecular targets in PCa cells including the Rho GTPase family members (for example, CDC42, CDC42EP3, RAC1 and ARPC5) and stem cell molecules CD44 and EZH2, all of which are validated as direct and functionally relevant targets of miR-141.

The mpMRIs were reported on a 5-point Likert scale of suspicion. Clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC) was defined as biopsy Gleason score â¥7.  Results:   After controlling for age, prostate-specific antigen level and prostate volume, there were no significant differences between A-A and Caucasian men in the detection rate of overall cancer (35.0% vs 34.2%, P = 0.9) and CSPC (18.8% vs 21.7%, P = 0.3) with MRI/US FTB. There were no significant differences between the races in the location of dominant lesions on mpMRI, and in the proportion of 5-point Likert scoring. In A-A men, MRI/US FTB from the grade 4-5 lesions outperformed random biopsy in the detection rate of overall cancer (70.6% vs 37.2%, P = 0.003) and CSPC (52.9% vs 12.4%, P < 0.001). MRI/US FTB outperformed random biopsy in cancer core length (5.0 vs 2.4 mm, P = 0.001), in cancer rate per core (24.9% vs 6.8%, P < 0.001), and in efficiency for detecting one patient with CSPC (mean number of cores needed 13.3 vs 81.9, P < 0.001), respectively.

The goal of this study was to determine quality of erections and possible factors affecting erections in this population. It was hypothesized that men who ambulate and do not have a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) are more likely to have erections sufficient for intercourse.  Methods:   An online survey was administered over an 18-month period to men aged â¥18 years and with SB. Participants were recruited through local, national and international SB organizations via social media. Exclusion criteria were: poor English proficiency, not completing the questionnaire or missing information regarding erections, VPS or ambulation. Data were collected on demographics, previous surgeries and function. Ambulatory status was classified using the Hoffer classification (Hoffer et al., 1973). Those able to walk at least at home, with or without crutches/braces, were classified as ""ambulators."" Erections were assessed using a single question from the validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire (e.g. normal: ""firm enough for intercourse""). Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   The median age of 122 participants was 33 years, 53.3% were ambulators and 70.5% had a VPS. Overall, 41.0% reported normal erections. Ambulators were more likely to report normal erections than non-ambulators (63.1% vs 15.8%, P < 0.001) (Table). Those with and without a VPS reported similar rates of normal erections (37.9% vs 48.6%, P = 0.32). On multivariate analysis, ambulators were more likely to have normal erections (OR â¥8.65, P â¤ 0.001) after correcting for age and VPS status. Age and VPS status were not correlated with normal erections on multivariate analysis (P â¥ 0.32 and P = 0.62, respectively).  Discussion:   Approximately 59% of men with SB reported ED, with ambulators being far more likely to have normal erections. This suggests that ambulatory status, similar to neurological lesion level, is a confounder of erectile function in the SB population. A limitation of the study was that a single item was used to assess erectile function. Rather than performing a comprehensive analysis of sexual health, the study aimed to gauge the prevalence of normal erections and assess possible risk factors. It did not assess sexual activity, erection duration or ED treatments. However, this is the largest study, to date, on SB and erectile quality with international participants.  Conclusion:   About 40% of men with SB reported normal erections. Ambulatory status, rather than hydrocephalus, appeared to be the primary factor associated with erectile function. Approximately 2/3 of ambulators and 1/6 of non-ambulators reported normal erections.""","""['J D Roth', 'R Misseri', 'M P Cain', 'K M Szymanski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Pediatr Urol""","""['Sexual activity and function of adult men with spina bifida.', 'The effect of spinal cord level on sexual function in the spina bifida population.', 'Ambulatory patients with spina bifida are 50% more likely to be fecally continent than non-ambulatory patients, particularly after a MACE procedure.', 'Sexual health in adult men with spina bifida.', 'Erection hardness: a unifying factor for defining response in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.', 'Sexual Function of Men and Women With Spina Bifida: A Scoping Literature Review.', 'The Use of Social Media in Pediatric Urology-Forging New Paths or Crossing Boundaries?']"""

TRUS-biopsy can cause side-effects including bleeding, pain, and infection. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid unnecessary TRUS-biopsy and improve diagnostic accuracy.  Methods:   We did this multicentre, paired-cohort, confirmatory study to test diagnostic accuracy of MP-MRI and TRUS-biopsy against a reference test (template prostate mapping biopsy [TPM-biopsy]). Men with prostate-specific antigen concentrations up to 15 ng/mL, with no previous biopsy, underwent 1Â·5 Tesla MP-MRI followed by both TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. Clinically significant cancer was defined as Gleason score â¥4 + 3 or a maximum cancer core length 6 mm or longer. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01292291.  Findings:   Between May 17, 2012, and November 9, 2015, we enrolled 740 men, 576 of whom underwent 1Â·5 Tesla MP-MRI followed by both TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. On TPM-biopsy, 408 (71%) of 576 men had cancer with 230 (40%) of 576 patients clinically significant. For clinically significant cancer, MP-MRI was more sensitive (93%, 95% CI 88-96%) than TRUS-biopsy (48%, 42-55%; p<0Â·0001) and less specific (41%, 36-46% for MP-MRI vs 96%, 94-98% for TRUS-biopsy; p<0Â·0001). 44 (5Â·9%) of 740 patients reported serious adverse events, including 8 cases of sepsis.  Interpretation:   Using MP-MRI to triage men might allow 27% of patients avoid a primary biopsy and diagnosis of 5% fewer clinically insignificant cancers. If subsequent TRUS-biopsies were directed by MP-MRI findings, up to 18% more cases of clinically significant cancer might be detected compared with the standard pathway of TRUS-biopsy for all. MP-MRI, used as a triage test before first prostate biopsy, could reduce unnecessary biopsies by a quarter. MP-MRI can also reduce over-diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer and improve detection of clinically significant cancer.

However, treatment with curative intent can lead to decrements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients treated with radical prostatectomy have been shown to suffer declines in urinary and sexual HRQoL as compared to those managed with active surveillance (AS). Similarly, patients treated with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) are hypothesized to experience greater declines in bowel HRQoL. As health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) concerns are paramount when selecting among treatment options for low-risk PCa, this study examined HRQoL outcomes in men undergoing EBRT as compared to AS in a prospective, racially diverse cohort.  Methods:   A prospective study of HRQoL in patients with PCa enrolled in the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) Multicenter National Database was initiated in 2007. The current study included patients diagnosed through April 2014. HRQoL was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36). Temporal changes in HRQoL were compared for patients with low-risk PCa managed on AS vs. EBRT at baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3 years post-PCa diagnosis. Longitudinal patterns were modeled using linear regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting for baseline HRQoL, demographic, and clinical patient characteristics.  Results:   Of the 499 eligible patients with low-risk PCa, 103 (21%) selected AS and 60 (12%) were treated with EBRT. Demographic characteristics of the treatment groups were similar, though a greater proportion of patients in the EBRT group were African American (P = 0.0003). At baseline, both treatment groups reported comparable HRQoL. EBRT patients experienced significantly worse bowel function and bother at 1 year (adjusted mean score: 87 vs. 95, P = 0.001 and 89 vs. 95, P = 0.008, respectively) and 2 years (87 vs. 93, P = 0.007 and 87 vs. 96, P = 0.002, respectively) compared to patients managed on AS. In contrast to those on AS, more than half the number of patients who received EBRT experienced a decline in bowel function (52% vs. 17%, p=0.003) and bother (52% vs. 15%, P = 0.002) from baseline to 1 year. Patients who received EBRT were significantly more likely to experience a decrease in more than one functional domain (urinary, sexual, bowel, or hormonal) at 1 year when compared with those on AS (60% vs. 28%, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Patients receiving EBRT for low-risk prostate cancer suffer declines in bowel HRQoL. These declines are not experienced by patients on AS, suggesting that management of low-risk prostate cancer with AS may offer a means for preserving HRQoL following prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['John S Banerji', 'Lauren M Hurwitz', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Erika M Wolff', 'Katherine E Levie', 'Inger L Rosner', 'Timothy C Brand', 'James O LÊ¼Esperance', 'Joseph R Sterbis', 'Christopher R Porter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prospective quality-of-life outcomes for low-risk prostate cancer: Active surveillance versus radical prostatectomy.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Long-term Health-related Quality of Life Outcomes After Surgery, Radiotherapy, or Active Surveillance for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The health-related quality of life in patients with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite survey: Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Trajectories in muscular strength and physical function among men with and without prostate cancer in the health aging and body composition study.', 'The Quality of Life among Men Receiving Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: An Integrative Review.', 'Symptoms predicting health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with localized radiation therapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   T1/T2-stage PCa patients receiving TRUS-guided brachytherapy from 2000 to 2014 were analyzed. From October 2006, patients received additional intraoperative adaptive CBCT planning for dosimetric evaluation and subsequent remedial seed placement in underdosed areas. Patients were stratified according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate BDFS (primary outcome), overall survival, and PCa-specific survival (secondary outcomes). Cox regression was used to assess the relation between CBCT use and biochemical failure (BF) and overall mortality.  Results:   In all, 1623 patients were included. Median followup was 99 months (interquartile range 70-115) for TRUS patients (n = 613) and 51 months (interquartile range 29-70) for CBCT patients (n = 1010).

In some of these cancers, autocrine production of FGF23 drives their proliferation. FGF23 synthesized within bone likely promotes the expansion of prostate cancer bone metastases. Hence, dietary or lifestyle factors which boost bone's production of FGF23 may encourage the induction and spread of prostate cancer. High dietary intakes of bioavailable phosphorus and of calcium have been found to boost FGF23 levels, and this accords well with prospective epidemiology pointing to high intakes of both phosphate and calcium as risk factors for aggressive prostate cancer. Hence, prospective studies correlating baseline FGF23 levels with subsequent risk for prostate cancer, or advanced prostate cancer, are needed. Natural plant-based diets, though not inherently low in calcium or phosphorus, provide forms of these that are less bioavailable than those in animal products, and hence may be expected to down-regulate bone's production of FGF23. This may play a role in the lower risk for clinical prostate cancer observed in vegans and quasi-vegan cultures.

In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced lipid accumulation is associated with NED phenotypes. IL-6 or ADT can induce NED in PCa cells via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³, a major lipogenic transcription factor) and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP, a major component of adiposome). In addition, ADRP protein can be detected in exosomes released from these cells and these exosomes are capable of inducing NED of PCa cells in a paracrine fashion.

Despite the availability of multiple treatment options for mCRPC, there is a lack of information on the effect that being initiated on AA or ENZ has on the combined prostate cancer treatment duration.  Objective:   To compare the combined duration of prostate cancer treatments of patients initiated on AA with that of patients initiated on ENZ.  Methods:   Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases from March 2012 to December 2014 were used to identify males with prostate cancer initiated on AA or ENZ (index therapy). Baseline characteristics were assessed during the 6 months pre-index. Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) were used to reduce baseline confounding. Treatment duration spanned from the index date to the earliest of treatment discontinuation (defined as a > 60-day gap in treatment), 24 months post-index, health plan disenrollment, or end of data. Weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the combined duration of mCRPC treatments (AA, ENZ, chemotherapy, sipuleucel-T, and radium 223) and any prostate cancer treatments (mCRPC, hormonal, and corticosteroid treatments) between patients initiated on either AA or ENZ.  Results:   A total of 2,591 patients initiated on AA and 807 patients initiated on ENZ were selected for the study. Patients' characteristics were generally well balanced after IPTW. At 3 months, patients initiated on AA were associated with fewer discontinuations of mCRPC treatments (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, P = 0.004) or of any prostate cancer treatments (HR = 0.61, P = 0.002), compared with patients initiated on ENZ. This result was maintained at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months for mCRPC treatments (HR = 0.75, P < 0.001) and for any prostate cancer treatments (HR = 0.69, P < 0.001). Median duration of mCRPC treatments was 4.1 months longer for patients initiated on AA compared with those initiated on ENZ (18.3 vs. 14.2 months, P < 0.001) and similarly, the median duration of any prostate cancer treatment was longer for patients initiated on AA compared with those initiated on ENZ (not reached vs. 22.2 months, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In this study, patients initiated on AA, compared with those initiated on ENZ, had a longer combined duration of mCRPC or prostate cancer treatments.

We employed multimodal strategy based on in-house PCa clinical samples, publicly available TCGA cohorts, a panel of cell lines, in silico analyses, and a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the role of miR-466 in PCa. Expression analyses revealed that miR-466 is under-expressed in PCa compared to normal tissues. Reconstitution of miR-466 in metastatic PCa cell lines impaired their oncogenic functions such as cell proliferation, migration/invasion and induced cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis compared to control miRNA. Conversely, attenuation of miR-466 in normal prostate cells induced tumorigenic characteristics. miR-466 suppressed PCa growth and metastasis through direct targeting of bone-related transcription factor RUNX2. Overexpression of miR-466 caused a marked downregulation of integrated network of RUNX2 target genes such as osteopontin, osteocalcin, ANGPTs, MMP11 including Fyn, pAkt, FAK and vimentin that are known to be involved in migration, invasion, angiogenesis, EMT and metastasis. Xenograft models indicate that miR-466 inhibits primary orthotopic tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis to bone. Receiver operating curve and Kaplan-Meier analyses show that miR-466 expression can discriminate between malignant and normal prostate tissues; and can predict biochemical relapse. In conclusion, our data strongly suggests miR-466-mediated attenuation of RUNX2 as a novel therapeutic approach to regulate PCa growth, particularly metastasis to bone.

Patients with Gleason upgrading were compared to those who were correctly graded with biopsy. Also, to analyze whether AS criteria may be expanded, by comparing patients outside the AS criteria without Gleason upgrading, to men eligible for AS.  Methods:   Low-risk PC was widely defined as clinically organ-confined and biopsy Gleason Score â¤3+3=6. Within this group, additional AS eligibility criteria were prostate-specific antigen (PSA)â¤10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.2 ng/mL/cc, and 1-2 positive biopsies.  Results:   Of 755 clinically organ-confined low-grade patients, 181 (24%) were suitable for AS, 324 (44%) had Gleason upgrading after surgery, and 132 (18%) showed BCR after a median follow-up of 1.8 years (25-75p 0.7-3.4). Gleason upgrading between biopsy and surgery score was significantly associated with unfavorable BCR rates (P<0.01) in clinically organ-confined low-grade patients, but it did not impact BCR in AS-suitable patients (P=0.936). Clinically organ-confined low-grade patients without Gleason Score upgrading showed BCR rates similar to patients who did fulfill all AS criteria (P=0.187).  Conclusions:   These results may be used to guide application of novel diagnostic (imaging) modalities in selection for AS. The added value of improved Gleason grading may be limited in AS-suitable patients, as Gleason upgrading does not impact BCR. However, in patients outside of the AS criteria in whom Gleason upgrading is excluded, BCR rates are not significantly different from AS-suitable patients, suggesting opportunities to expand AS criteria.""","""['Roderick C van den Bergh', 'Homayoun Zargar', 'Stijn Heijmink', 'Mike Bozin', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nefrol""","""['Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'What is the optimal definition of misclassification in patients with very low-risk prostate cancer eligible for active surveillance?

This study was aimed to determine whether the presence and severity of LUTS, as assessed by the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), could help to identify patients at higher risk of prostate cancer (PCa) on prostate biopsy (PBx). In this effort, an initial PCa predictive model was calculated and IPSS was subsequently added. The diagnostic accuracy of both models was compared.  Methods:   The analysis of prospectively collected data of patients scheduled for PBx at four academic hospitals between January 2012 and June 2015 was performed. Univariate and multivariate analysis assessed the correlation between the IPSS and the risk of being diagnosed with PCa; Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis evaluated the predictive models including or not the IPSS.  Results:   Of the 1366 enrolled patients, 706 (52%) were diagnosed with PCa. Patients with PCa had a significantly lower IPSS (10.6Â±7.4 vs. 12.7Â±8.1) than those with benign diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume and IPSS were the most significant predictors of PBx outcome, (OR 1.61, P=0.001; OR 1.20, P=0.001; OR 0.97, P=0.001; OR 0.74, P=0.004; respectively).

As for acceptors, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped GNRs were treated with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUDA) and then conjugated with Anti-PSA 2 (Ab2). When PSA was added, donors and acceptors were brought in close proximity through specific interactions of antibodies and antigens, resulting in high quenching efficiency levels. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of detection was 3.75-938 pg/mL for PSA (R = 0.999), with a detection limit as low as 3.16 pg/mL.

Objective:   This study aimed to evaluate the PSA levels in the serum of diabetic and non-diabetic Moroccan males.  Methods:   In a cross-sectional study, four hundred and seventy diabetic and 869 non-diabetic males were screened from January 2015 to April 2016 at Pasteur institute of Morocco. Hemoglobin A1c and Fasting Blood Glucose were measured using high performance liquid chromatography and dry chemistry, respectively. We used a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology to evaluate the levels of Serum PSA and testosterone.  Results:   Overall, the PSA levels revealed no significant difference between diabetic and non-diabetic males (1.31 Â± 0.04ng/mL vs.1.36 Â± 0.03ng/mL, p = 0.380, respectively). The PSA levels increased with age both in non-diabetics and diabetics. Moreover, in diabetic subjects, the PSA levels were less age dependent (p =0.002) than in non-diabetic (p < 0.0001). The stratified analysis showed that the PSA was significantly lower in diabetic than in non-diabetic subjects aged between 50-59 years (p= 0.0004). Furthermore, no significant testosterone concentrations were observed in the subjects with or without diabetes (p= 0.904).

Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several susceptibility genes of prostate cancer. However, these single locus results can only explain a small proportion of the genetic etiology. In order to understand how multiple genetic variants may contribute to the penetrance of prostate cancer, we conducted a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction study in four populations, involving 5,269 cases and 5,289 controls. We exhaustively evaluated all pairs of SNP-SNP interactions for 661,658 SNPs that were consensus in all four groups, and then performed a meta-analysis to combine the results. We found multiple variants within region 7p21.3 and 18p11.22 significantly interacted with each other and reached genome-wide significance levels. The most significant epistasis was between rs1105255 (intergenic, near RBSG3) and rs651431 (intergenic, near VAPA) (p = 1.4 Ã 10-14 ). Notably, VAPA was identified to be the protein-coding transcripts as PTEN competing endogenous RNA in prostate cancer. And PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor gene frequently altered in cancers. In addition, 7p21.3 involves several pseudogenes, whose parental genes are cancer-related. Recently, growing evidence strongly suggests they are of multifaceted involvements in the pathogenesis of cancer. Multiple regulatory elements were found within 7p21.3 and 18p11.22, indicating the variants might regulate the nearby genes and confer risk of disease. Additionally, we also found several other significant epistasis, most of which were near or in cancer-related genes.

In prostate cancer, FOR varies with health and treatment type, but little is known about how survivors' appraisals of their treatment, and in particular, their level of regret over treatment decisions may affect this.  Methods:   A total of 1229 prostate cancer survivors between 2- and 5-years postdiagnosis were invited to complete a postal questionnaire including a FOR scale, Decisional Regret Scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C30 health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument. Multiple regression analysis explored the impact of 3 blocks of factors on FOR: (1) demographic characteristics and disease extent, (2) primary treatment received and health status (treatment side effects and HRQoL), and (3) treatment appraisals, specifically satisfaction with information received regarding treatment and level of regret experienced over treatment decisions.  Results:   The final multivariable model explained 27% of variance on FOR. Significant correlates of lower FOR included having localised disease, having undergone an invasive treatment, as well as health status (higher HRQoL and fewer ongoing side effects). Beyond this, appraisals of treatment significantly contributed to the model: More decisional regret and lower satisfaction with information received were associated with higher FOR.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that FOR may be mitigated by providing survivors with more information regarding treatment choices and the treatment itself so that men can make well-informed decisions and experience less future regret.

Methods:   Fifteen PMC patients and 6 caregivers participated in either a focus group or individual interview. Focus groups were segmented by patients' treatment choice. Primary themes were identified in transcripts using thematic text analysis.  Results:   Four themes emerged from the surgery subsample: (1) Decision to undergo thyroidectomy quickly and with a sense of urgency; (2) Perception of PMC as a potentially life-threatening disease; (3) Fear of disease progression and unremitting uncertainty with active surveillance; and (4) Surgery as a means of control and potential cure. Three themes emerged from the active surveillance subsample: (1) View of PMC as a common, indolent, and low-risk disease; (2) Concerns about adjusting to life without a thyroid and becoming reliant on hormone replacement medication; and (3) Openness to reconsidering surgery over the long run. Two themes were identified that were shared by participants from both subsamples: (1) Deep level of trust and confidence in physician and cancer center; and (2) Use of physician and internet as primary sources of disease and treatment-related information.  Conclusions:   Several factors influenced participants' treatment choice, with similarities and differences noted between surgery and active surveillance subsamples. Many of the emergent themes are consistent with research on decision making among localized prostate cancer patients. Findings suggest that participants from both PMC treatment subsamples are motivated to reduce illness and treatment-related uncertainty.""","""[""Thomas A D'Agostino"", 'Elyse Shuk', 'Erin K Maloney', 'Rebecca Zeuren', 'R Michael Tuttle', 'Carma L Bylund']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""[""Patients' experiences of diagnosis and management of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: a qualitative study."", 'A Prospective Mixed-Methods Study of Decision-Making on Surgery or Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Papillary Thyroid Cancer.', 'Incidences of Unfavorable Events in the Management of Low-Risk Papillary Microcarcinoma of the Thyroid by Active Surveillance Versus Immediate Surgery.', 'Low-risk papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid: A review of active surveillance trials.', 'Factors That Inform Individual Decision Making Between Active Surveillance, Hemithyroidectomy and Total Thyroidectomy for Low-Risk Thyroid Cancer: A Scoping Review.', 'Operative Management of Thyroid Disease in Older Adults.', 'Characterizing the patient experience during neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A qualitative study.', 'Radioactive iodine therapy: multiple faces of the same polyhedron.', 'Active Surveillance of Thyroid Microcarcinomas: a Critical View.', 'Physician Specialties Involved in Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment: Implications for Improving Health Care Disparities.']"""

Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has been shown to act as paracrine/autocrine factor in various malignancies including prostate cancer. GHRH and its receptors are expressed in experimental models of BPH, in which antagonists of GHRH suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and altered the expression of genes related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We investigated the effects of GHRH antagonist on prostatic enlargement induced by inflammation. Autoimmune prostatitis in Balb/C mice was induced by a homogenate of reproductive tissues of male rats. During the 8-wk induction of chronic prostatitis, we detected a progressive increase in prostatic volume reaching 92% at week 8 compared with control (P < 0.001). Daily treatment for 1 mo with GHRH antagonist MIA-690 caused a 30% reduction in prostate volume (P < 0.05). Conditioned medium derived from macrophages increased the average volume of spheres by 82.7% (P < 0.001) and elevated the expression of mRNA for N-cadherin, Snail, and GHRH GHRH antagonist reduced the average volume of spheres stimulated by inflammation by 75.5% (P < 0.05), and TGF-Î²2 by 91.8% (P < 0.01). The proliferation of primary epithelial cells stimulated by IL-17A or TGF-Î²2 was also inhibited by 124.1% and 69.9%, respectively. GHRH stimulated the growth of BPH-1 and primary prostate spheres.

However, the approaches with promising sensitivity and specificity to detect LNM are still lacking. We investigated the value of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) promoter methylation in biopsies as a predictor for LNM.  Methods:   CRMP4 promoter methylation at two previously identified CpG sites was determined in 80 case-matched biopsy samples (the training set) using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The predictive cutoff value was independently validated using cohort I of 339 PCa patients (Southern China) and cohort II of 328 case patients (Germany, across China). Mann-Whitney U test, the receiver operating characteristic curve, McNemar's test, and logistic regression were used to assess data. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   In the training set, CRMP4 promoter methylation (â¥15.0% methylated) was statistically significantly associated with LNM (P < 001). Successful validations were achieved in both cohorts I and II (sensitivity = 92.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 79.3 to 97.9, and sensitivity = 92.2%, 95% CI = 81.1 to 97.8, respectively; specificity = 92.7%, 95% CI = 80.2 to 99.1, and specificity = 91.3%, 95% CI = 87.4 to 94.4, respectively). The sensitivity of CRMP4 promoter methylation is superior to conventional MRI (cohort I: 92.3% vs 26.2%, P < 001; cohort II: 92.2% vs 33.3%, P < 001).

Participants:   163 363 men and women aged 16 or older at study induction, who were initially free of a cancer diagnosis, provided self reported psychological distress scores (based on the general health questionnaire, GHQ-12) and consented to health record linkage.  Main outcome measure:   Vital status records used to ascertain death from 16 site specific malignancies; the three Scottish studies also had information on cancer registration (incidence).

The expression profile of TSP-2 on tumors is controversial, and it up-regulates in some cancers, whereas it down-regulates in others, suggesting that the functional role of TSP-2 on tumors is still uncertain.  Methods:   The expression of TSP-2 on prostate cancer progression was determined in the tissue array by the immunohistochemistry. The molecular mechanism of TSP-2 on prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis was investigated through pharmaceutical inhibitors, siRNAs, and miRNAs analyses. The role of TSP-2 on PCa metastasis in vivo was verified through xenograft in vivo imaging system.  Results:   Based on the gene expression omnibus database and immunohistochemistry, we found that TSP-2 increased with the progression of PCa, especially in metastatic PCa and is correlated with the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression. Additionally, through binding to CD36 and integrin Î±Î½Î²3, TSP-2 increased cell migration and MMP-2 expression. With inhibition of p38, ERK, and JNK, the TSP-2-induced cell migration and MMP-2 expression were abolished, indicating that the TSP-2's effect on PCa is MAPK dependent. Moreover, the microRNA-376c (miR-376c) was significantly decreased by the TSP-2 treatment. Furthermore, the TSP-2-induced MMP-2 expression and the subsequent cell motility were suppressed upon miR-376c mimic stimulation. On the other hand, the animal studies revealed that the bone metastasis was abolished when TSP-2 was stably knocked down in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our results indicate that TSP-2 enhances the migration of PCa cells by increasing MMP-2 expression through down-regulation of miR-376c expression. Therefore, TSP-2 may represent a promising new target for treating PCa.""","""['Po-Chun Chen', 'Chih-Hsin Tang', 'Liang-Wei Lin', 'Chun-Hao Tsai', 'Cheng-Ying Chu', 'Tien-Huang Lin', 'Yuan-Li Huang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['Thrombospondins, metallo proteases and thrombospondin receptors messenger RNA and protein expression in different tumour sublines of the Dunning prostate cancer model.', 'MicroRNA-466 inhibits tumor growth and bone metastasis in prostate cancer by direct regulation of osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2.', 'Copy number gain of ZEB1 mediates a double-negative feedback loop with miR-33a-5p that regulates EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer dependent on TGF-Î² signaling.', 'Molecular mechanisms of metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Thrombospondin-1 in urological cancer: pathological role, clinical significance, and therapeutic prospects.', 'Identification of Genetic Risk Factors for Keratinocyte Cancer in Immunosuppressed Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: A Case-Control Study.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Identification of lncRNA and mRNA regulatory networks associated with gastric cancer progression.', 'Using biological constraints to improve prediction in precision oncology.', 'Thrombospondin-2 promotes the proliferation and migration of glioma cells and contributes to the progression of glioma.']"""

Methods:   Patients' records from January 2009 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed, and 3469 patients with localized prostate cancer were identified at 45 institutions. Individual surgeon's experience with nerve sparing was recorded as the number of nerve sparing cases among total robot-assisted radical prostatectomies beginning with the first case during which nerve sparing was carried out. Patients were selected by propensity score matching for nerve sparing, and predictive factors of positive surgical margins were analyzed in patients with and without positive surgical margins.  Results:   A total of 152 surgeons were studied, and the median number of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases for all surgeons was 21 (range 1-511). In all, 54 surgeons (35.5%) undertook nerve sparing during their first robot-assisted radical prostatectomy case. For 2388 patients selected with (1194) and without (1194) nerve sparing, predictive factors for positive surgical margin were high initial prostate-specific antigen level (P < 0.0001), high biopsy Gleason score (P = 0.0379), presence of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (P = 0.0002) and surgeon's experience with >100 cases (P = 0.0058).

Impaired bladder contraction results in a lower peak Watts factor and poorly sustained detrusor contractions. From this viewpoint, the maximum Watts factor and its pattern should be considered separately. To examine detrusor contraction pattern in patients after radical prostatectomy by using multiple parameters.  Methods:   A total of 37 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent both pre- and post-radical prostatectomy urodynamic evaluations. The examined urodynamic parameters included the maximum flow rate, post-void residual volume, detrusor pressure at maximum flow, maximum Watts factor and relative volume (maximum Watts factor). Some parameters were defined from the Watts factor curve throughout micturition. Relative volume (maximum Watts factor) was the relative bladder volume at the maximum Watts factor. A normal detrusor contractility pattern involves an increase in Watts factor at the initiation followed by further gradual increases until the end of micturition.  Results:   Maximum flow rate increased significantly after radical prostatectomy (pre: 13.0 Â± 6.5, post: 17.3 Â± 7.7 mL/min; P < 0.01), whereas detrusor pressure at maximum flow and post-void residual volume decreased significantly (pre: 49.6 Â± 21.6 and 31.4 Â± 18.2 cmH2 O; post: 48.6 Â± 66.1 and 10.1 Â± 28.5 mL; P < 0.05).

Maximum Watts factor represents the maximum power of bladder contraction at a particular point in time, whereas relative volume (maximum Watts factor) can be used to detect changes in detrusor contraction pattern.

This study aimed to determine the physiochemical properties and the antioxidant and anti-proliferative capacities of P. trimera leaf (PTL) using microwave drying for the preparation of dry sample; MeOH and microwave-assisted extraction for the preparation of crude extract; and freeze-drying for the preparation of powdered extract. The results showed that total phenolic, total flavonoid, proanthocyanidin, and saponin contents of PTL prepared by microwave drying at 450 W were 25.4 mg gallic acid equiv. (GAE), 86.3 mg rutin equiv. (RE), 5.6 mg catechin equiv. (CE), and 702.1 mg escin equiv. (EE) per gram dried sample, respectively. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, and quercetin were identified in the PTL MeOH extract. Dried PTL displayed potent antioxidant activity, while the powdered PTL extract exhibited great anti-proliferative capacity on various cancer cell lines including MiaPaCa-2 (pancreas), HT29 (colon), A2780 (ovarian), H460 (lung), A431 (skin), Du145 (prostate), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), MCF-7 (breast), MCF-10A (normal breast), and U87, SJ-G2, and SMA (glioblastoma). Anti-proliferative capacity on pancreatic cancer cells (MiaCaPa2, BxPc3, and CFPAC1) of PTL extract (200 Î¼g/ml) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of ostruthin (20 Î¼g/ml) and gemcitabine (50 nm), and to be comparable to the powdered P. trimera root extract and a saponin-enriched extract from quillajia bark (a commercial product). The findings from this study allow us to conclude that the PTL is a rich source of phytochemicals that possess promising antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities, therefore it shows potential as lead compounds for application in the nutraceutical, medicinal and pharmaceutical industries.""","""['Van Tang Nguyen', 'Jennette A Sakoff', 'Christopher J Scarlett']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Chem Biodivers""","""['Physicochemical, Antioxidant, and Cytotoxic Properties of Xao Tam Phan (Paramignya trimera) Root Extract and Its Fractions.', 'Physicochemical Properties, Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Activities of Crude Extracts and Fractions from Phyllanthus amarus.', 'Phytochemical, antioxidant, anti-proliferative and antimicrobial properties of Catharanthus roseus root extract, saponin-enriched and aqueous fractions.', 'Anti-proliferative, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of phytochemicals isolated from Anatolian medicinal plants.', '7-Isopentenyloxycoumarin: What Is New across the Last Decade.', 'Anti-Inflammatory and Wound Healing Properties of Leaf and Rhizome Extracts from the Medicinal Plant Peucedanum ostruthium (L.)

However, few such biomarkers are currently available, and the process of biomarker identification and validation is prolonged and complicated by inefficient methods of discovery and few reliable analytical platforms. Therefore, in this Perspective, we look at the advanced chemistry of aptamer molecules and their significant role as molecular probes in biomarker studies. As a special class of functional nucleic acids evolved from an iterative technology termed Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), these single-stranded oligonucleotides can recognize their respective targets with selectivity and affinity comparable to those of protein antibodies. Because of their fast turnaround time and exceptional chemical properties, aptamer probes can serve as novel molecular tools for biomarker investigations, particularly in assisting identification of new disease-related biomarkers. More importantly, aptamers are able to recognize biomarkers from complex biological environments such as blood serum and cell surfaces, which can provide direct evidence for further clinical applications.

Currently, the clinical parameters used to diagnose prostate cancer, such as Gleason score, pathological tumor staging, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression level, are considered insufficient to inform recommendation to guide clinical practice. Thus, identification of a novel biomarker is necessary. TWIST is one of the well-studied targets and is correlated with cancer invasion and metastasis in several human cancers. We have investigated two largest prostate cancer patient cohorts available in GEO database and found that TWIST expression is positive correlated with Gleason score and associated with poorer survival. By using a prostate cancer cohort and a prostate cancer cell line dataset, we have identified three potential downstream targets of TWIST, PPM1A, SRP72 and TBCB. TWIST's prognostic capacity is lost when the gene is mutated. Further investigation in the prostate cancer cohort revealed that gene expression of SERPINA, STX7, PDIA2, FMP5, GP1BB, VGLL4, KCNMA1, SHMT2, SAA4 and DIDO1 influence the prognostic significance of TWIST and vice versa. Importantly, eight out of these ten genes are prognostic indicator by itself.

Signals were quantified using image analysis software. The 5'ETS rRNA signal was restricted to the nucleolus. The signal was markedly attenuated in cell lines and in prostate tissue slices after pharmacologic inhibition of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) using BMH-21 or actinomycin D, and by RNAi depletion of Pol I, demonstrating validity as a measure of Pol I activity. Clinical human prostate FFPE tissue sections and TMAs showed a marked increase in the signal in the presumptive precursor lesion (high-grade PIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma lesions (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with non-neoplastic luminal epithelium.

The homologous transcription factors ETS1 and ETS2 mediate activation of gene expression programs downstream of RAS/MAPK signaling. ETS1 is important for oncogenesis in many tumor types. However, ETS2 can act as an oncogene in some cellular backgrounds, and as a tumor suppressor in others, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this cell-type specific function remains unknown. Here, we show that ETS1 and ETS2 can regulate a cell migration gene expression program in opposite directions, and provide the first comparison of the ETS1 and ETS2 cistromes. This genomic data and an ETS1 deletion line reveal that the opposite function of ETS2 is a result of binding site competition and transcriptional attenuation due to weaker transcriptional activation by ETS2 compared to ETS1.

However, large numbers of unique mutations in the Gp3 and Gp4 tumors showed that the Gp4 were not derived directly from the Gp3. Remarkably, the Gp3 tumors retain their indolent-appearing morphology despite acquisition of multiple genomic alterations, including tumor suppressor losses. Although there were no consistent genomic alterations that distinguished Gp3 from Gp4, pairwise transcriptome analyses identified increased c-Myc and decreased p53 activity in Gp4 versus adjacent clonal Gp3 foci.Conclusions: These findings establish that at least a subset of Gp3 and aggressive Gp4 tumors have a common origin, and support a branched evolution model wherein the Gp3 and Gp4 tumors emerge early from a common precursor and subsequently undergo substantial divergence. Genomic alterations detectable in the Gp3 may distinguish these tumors from truly indolent Gp3. Screening for a panel of these genomic alterations in men who have prostate biopsies showing only Gp3 (Gleason score 6, Gs6) may allow for more precise selection of men who can be safely managed by active surveillance versus those who may benefit from further intervention.

The first prototype is presented in this study: the probe consists of a gamma camera featuring three single cone pinhole collimators embedded in a tungsten tube, above three, high resolution pixelated detectors (Timepix).  Methods:   The prostate was imaged with a TRUS system using a sagittal crystal with a 2.5mm slice thickness. Eleven needles containing a total of thirty 0.508U125I seeds were implanted under ultrasound guidance. A CT scan was used to localise the seed positions, as well as provide a reference when performing the image co-registration between the BrachyView coordinate system and the TRUS coordinate system. An in-house visualisation software interface was developed to provide a quantitative 3D reconstructed prostate based on the TRUS images and co-registered with the LDR seeds in situ. A rigid body image registration was performed between the BrachyView and TRUS systems, with the BrachyView and CT-derived source locations compared.  Results:   The reconstructed seed positions determined by the BrachyView probe showed a maximum discrepancy of 1.78mm, with 75% of the seeds reconstructed within 1mm of their nominal location. An accurate co-registration between the BrachyView and TRUS coordinate system was established.

To identify factors that influence data quality and areas for improvement.  Methods:   A dynamic cohort study in a Dutch network database containing 250,000 anonymized electronic medical records (EMRs) from 52 general practices was performed. Coded data from 2000 to 2011 for the three most common cancer types (breast, colon and prostate cancer) was compared to the Netherlands Cancer Registry.  Measurements:   Data quality is expressed in Standard Incidence Ratios (SIRs): the ratio between the number of coded cases observed in the primary care network database and the expected number of cases based on the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Ratios were multiplied by 100% for readability.  Results:   The overall SIR was 91.5% (95%CI 88.5-94.5) and showed improvement over the years. SIRs differ between cancer types: from 71.5% for colon cancer in males to 103.9% for breast cancer. There are differences in data quality (SIRs 76.2% - 99.7%) depending on the EMR system used, with SIRs up to 232.9% for breast cancer. Frequently observed errors in routine healthcare data can be classified as: lack of integrity checks, inaccurate use and/or lack of codes, and lack of EMR system functionality.  Conclusions:   Re-users of coded routine primary care Electronic Medical Record data should be aware that 30% of cancer cases can be missed. Up to 130% of cancer cases found in the EMR data can be false-positive. The type of EMR system and the type of cancer influence the quality of coded diagnosis registry. While data quality can be improved (e.g. through improving system design and by training EMR system users), re-use should only be taken care of by appropriately trained experts.""","""['Annet Sollie', 'Rolf H Sijmons', 'Charles Helsper', 'Mattijs E Numans']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Med Inform""","""['Do GPs know their patients with cancer?

A majority of these radioligands to date target the Ï2 receptor, a potential marker of tumor proliferative status. The identification of approximately equal proportions of both Ï receptor subtypes in prostate tumors suggests that a high affinity, dual Ï receptor-targeting radioligand could potentially provide enhanced tumor targeting efficacy in prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we designed a series of ligands which bind to both Ï receptor subtypes with high affinity. Ligand 3a in this series, displaying optimal dual Ï receptor subtype affinity (Ï1, 6.3 nM; Ï2, 10.2 nM) was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 (18F) to give [18F]3a and evaluated as a Ï receptor-targeting radioligand in the mouse PC-3 prostate tumor model. Cellular assays with PC-3 cells demonstrated that a major proportion of [18F]3a was localized to cell surface Ï receptors, while â¼10% of [18F]3a was internalized within cells after incubation for 3.5 h. Serial PET imaging in mice bearing PC-3 tumors revealed that uptake of [18F]3a was 1.6 Â± 0.8, 4.4 Â± 0.3, and 3.6 Â± 0.6% ID/g (% injection dose per gram) in Ï receptor-positive prostate tumors at 15 min, 1.5 h, and 3.5 h postinjection, respectively (n = 3) resulting in clear tumor visualization. Blocking studies conducted with haloperidol (a nonselective inhibitor for both Ï receptor subtypes) confirmed that the uptake of [18F]3a was Ï receptor-mediated. Histology analysis confirmed similar expression of Ï1 and Ï2 in PC-3 tumors which was significantly greater than its expression in normal organs/tissues such as liver, kidney, and muscle. Metabolite studies revealed that >50% of radioactivity in PC-3 tumors at 30 min postinjection represented intact [18F]3a. Prominent Ï receptor-specific uptake of [18F]3a in prostate tumors and its subsequent clear visualization with PET imaging indicate potential utility for the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma.""","""['Dongzhi Yang', 'Anthony Comeau', 'Wayne D Bowen', 'Robert H Mach', 'Brian D Ross', 'Hao Hong', 'Marcian E Van Dort']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Comparative evaluation of 4 and 6-carbon spacer conformationally flexible tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzamide analogues for imaging the sigma-2 receptor status of solid tumors.', 'Fluorine-18-labeled benzamide analogues for imaging the sigma2 receptor status of solid tumors with positron emission tomography.', 'Synthesis, in vitro binding, and tissue distribution of radioiodinated 2-125IN-(N-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-iodo benzamide, 2-125IBP: a potential sigma receptor marker for human prostate tumors.', 'Molecular Probes for Imaging the Sigma-2 Receptor: In Vitro and In Vivo Imaging Studies.', 'Fluorinated PET Tracers for Molecular Imaging of Ï1 Receptors in the Central Nervous System.', 'A carbon monoxide releasing metal organic framework nanoplatform for synergistic treatment of triple-negative breast tumors.', 'Affinity probes based on small-molecule inhibitors for tumor imaging.', 'Development of tumor-targeting aza-vesamicol derivatives with high affinity for sigma receptors for cancer theranostics.', 'Synthesis of Ï Receptor Ligands with a Spirocyclic System Connected with a Tetrahydroisoquinoline Moiety via Different Linkers.', 'Evaluation of Radioiodinated Fluoronicotinamide/Fluoropicolinamide-Benzamide Derivatives as Theranostic Agents for Melanoma.']"""

In this study, we used n-butyl alcohol extract of Litchi seed (NLS) to treat prostate cancer PC3, DU145, RM1 and C4-2B cells. NLS induced a significant decrease in cell viability and clonogenic growth in a dose-dependent manner. NLS induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle G1/S phase arrest by inactivating Akt signaling pathway, which were associated with activation of mitochondrial caspase-dependent apoptotic cascades, up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27, and inhibition of correlated cyclin/CDK network. In addition, NLS treatment significantly decreased cell migration and invasion via phenotypic inversion of EMT, correlated with increased expression of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin, and decreased expression of vimentin and snail, which is partially attributed to inhibiting Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway. Finally, PC3 xenograft nude mice treated with NLS in vivo showed a significant decrease in tumor size without toxicity.

The development of intratumoral drug-resistant subpopulations possessing a cancer stem cell (CSC) morphology is an emerging mechanism of docetaxel resistance, a process driven by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study characterised EMT in docetaxel-resistant sublines through increased invasion, MMP-1 production and ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression. We also present evidence for differential EMT across PC-3 and DU145 in vitro resistance models as characterised by differential migration, cell colony scattering and susceptibility to the CSC inhibitor salinomycin. siRNA manipulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 in PC-3 and DU145 docetaxel-resistant sublines identified ZEB1, through its transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, to be a driver of both EMT and docetaxel resistance. The clinical relevance of ZEB1 was also determined through immunohistochemical tissue microarray assessment, revealing significantly increased ZEB1 expression in prostate tumours following docetaxel treatment. This study presents evidence for a role of ZEB1, through its transcriptional repression of E-cadherin to be a driver of both EMT and docetaxel resistance in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.

This study assesses rates of patient activation in breast and prostate cancer survivors and explores the characteristics associated with patient activation.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study of survivors with localized (Stage I or II) breast and prostate cancers who were post-treatment (between 1-10+ years) were recruited from 4 community hospital sites in New Jersey. Survey data on patient characteristics (demographic and psychosocial) and clinical factors were assessed to explore the relationships with patient activation using the Patient Activation Measure-13.  Results:   Among 325 survivors (112 prostate; 213 breast), overall patient activation was high (M = 3.25). Activation was significantly lower among prostate survivors when compared with breast cancer survivors (M = 3.25 [SD, 0.38] vs M = 3.34 [SD, 0.37], P<.05). For prostate survivors, race (P < .05), marital status (P < .001), employment status (P < .01), household income (P < .05), and fear of recurrence (P < .01) were significantly associated with patient activation. For both groups, ease of access to oncology team and primary care physicians (PCPs) (all P values < .001) and perceptions of time spent with oncologists' team and PCPs (all P values < .01) were positive predictors of activation.  Conclusions:   In both breast and prostate survivors, access to providers (both PCPs and oncologists) and perception that adequate time spent with providers were associated with activation. Therefore, clinical interventions maybe a promising avenue to improve patient activation.

The purpose of this work is to develop an autonomous treatment planning strategy with effective use of prior knowledge and in a clinically realistic treatment planning platform to facilitate radiation therapy workflow.  Method:   Our technique consists of three major components: (i) a clinical treatment planning system (TPS); (ii) a formulation of decision-function constructed using an assemble of prior treatment plans; (iii) a plan evaluator or decision-function and an outer-loop optimization independent of the clinical TPS to assess the TPS-generated plan and to drive the search toward a solution optimizing the decision-function. Microsoft (MS) Visual Studio Coded UI is applied to record some common planner-TPS interactions as subroutines for querying and interacting with the TPS. These subroutines are called back in the outer-loop optimization program to navigate the plan selection process through the solution space iteratively. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by using clinical prostate and head-and-neck cases.  Results:   An autonomous treatment planning technique with effective use of an assemble of prior treatment plans is developed to automatically maneuver the clinical treatment planning process in the platform of a commercial TPS. The process mimics the decision-making process of a human planner and provides a clinically sensible treatment plan automatically, thus reducing/eliminating the tedious manual trial-and-errors of treatment planning. It is found that the prostate and head-and-neck treatment plans generated using the approach compare favorably with that used for the patients' actual treatments.  Conclusions:   Clinical inverse treatment planning process can be automated effectively with the guidance of an assemble of prior treatment plans. The approach has the potential to significantly improve the radiation therapy workflow.""","""['Huan Wang', 'Peng Dong', 'Hongcheng Liu', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Application programming in C# environment with recorded user software interactions and its application in autopilot of VMAT/IMRT treatment planning.', 'A plan template-based automation solution using a commercial treatment planning system.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'Automatizing a nonscripting TPS for optimizing clinical workflow and reoptimizing IMRT/VMAT plans.', 'The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Using feasibility dose-volume histograms to reduce intercampus plan quality variability for head-and-neck cancer.', 'Development and Validation of an Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict 10-Year Prostate Cancer Mortality.', 'A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for intelligent automatic treatment planning of prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric Quality of Online Adapted Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Plans on an MRI-Guided Radiation Therapy System.', 'Real-time interactive planning for radiotherapy of head and neck cancer with volumetric modulated arc therapy.']"""

This is investigated using a novel blade collimation system enabling tube current modulated (TCM) volume-of-interest (VOI) imaging of prostate fiducial markers during radiotherapy, and Monte Carlo simulation of MV scatter.  Materials and methods:   A four-blade dynamic kV collimator was used to track a VOI containing gold fiducial markers embedded in a dynamic pelvis phantom during gantry rotation. For each fiducial, a VOI margin around each marker was set to be 2Ï of the population covariance matrix characterizing prostate motion. This was used to conform to a single or several fiducials and compared to a static field. DRRs were used to calculate the kV attenuation for each VOI as a function of angle and used to optimize x-ray tube current during acquisition. Image quality was assessed with regard to contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), fiducial detectability, and imaging dose. Monte Carlo simulations in EGSnrc were used to calculate the imaging dose to the phantom and MV scatter fluence to the imaging panel.  Results:   Fiducials can be accurately located using a VOI containing a single or several fiducials using a relatively high constant kV output. However, when using a 6 Ã 6 cm2 field the dose can be upwards of 1.5 Gy in bone for constant kV output and 3.1 Gy when applying TCM at 1 Hz imaging over the course of 40 fractions. This can be mitigated through tailoring the imaging field to a single or several fiducials, in which the integral dose is reduced by a factor of 15.6 and 3.7, respectively. For a constant MV treatment field size, the scattered fluence reaching the kV panel varies by less than a factor of two for a completely rotation of the gantry. However, the MV scatter spectrum overlaps with the detector response for a deleterious effect, with a peak MV scatter energy of approximately 100 keV. TCM can be used to overcome the variability in image quality throughout the rotation and therefore improve fiducial CNR and detectability during periods of high kV attenuation.  Conclusions:   The combination of VOI and TCM introduces an advantageous approach in intrafraction monitoring of the prostate during radiotherapy by both reducing and localizing the imaging dose, while improving image quality and fiducial detectability during periods of high kV attenuation. In addition, the influence of MV scatter has been shown to be most important in low attenuation regions, with a variation by a factor of two.""","""['David Parsons', 'M Tynan R Stevens', 'James L Robar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimizing fiducial visibility on periodically acquired megavoltage and kilovoltage image pairs during prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Volume of interest CBCT and tube current modulation for image guidance using dynamic kV collimation.', 'Determining appropriate imaging parameters for kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring: an experimental phantom study.', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Less Time Is Less Motion: Analysis of Practical Efficiencies Gained With a Modified Workflow Integrating Planar kV Midimaging With CBCT for Spine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.']"""

This contained a high content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, demonstrating in vitro antioxidant activity and significant antiproliferative effect on human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line. Seventy PC patients and 120 age-matched healthy subjects participated in the study, with glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and catalase activity evaluated before and after GT consumption. The results showed a reduced GSH and catalase activity and a high level of MDA in erythrocytes from PC patients. The consumption of 2-3 cups per day of GT during 6 months significantly increased GSH concentration and catalase activity and decreased MDA concentration. In conclusion, GT significantly decreased OS in Algerian PC patients.

There are 5 patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, 1 patient with bladder cancer and 11 patients with prostatic cancer. All of them have undergone radiation therapy for bone metastasis in urinary organ cancer between April 2007 and March 2014 in the Department of Urology, Kanazawa Medical University. The mean age of the patients was 66.7 years old. We looked at irradiated areas, exposure dose and changes of symptom in all patients. (Results) Irradiated areas are thoracolumbar vertebrae (14 sites), cranial base (2 sites), pubic bone (1 site), ilium bone (2 sites), sacral bone (1 site), rib bone (1 site) and hip joint (1 site). The mean exposure dose of one area is 37.5 Gy (13.5-60). 19 irradiated sites which were previously reported to have sharp pain have gained improvement at 16 sites.

The impact of diet on lncRNA expression is largely unknown. Sulforaphane (SFN), obtained from vegetables like broccoli, can prevent and suppress cancer formation. Here we tested the hypothesis that SFN attenuates the expression of cancer-associated lncRNAs. We analyzed whole-genome RNA-sequencing data of normal human prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells treated with 15 Î¼M SFN or dimethylsulfoxide. SFN significantly altered expression of ~100 lncRNAs in each cell type and normalized the expression of some lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in cancer cells. SFN-mediated alterations in lncRNA expression correlated with genes that regulate cell cycle, signal transduction and metabolism. LINC01116 was functionally investigated because it was overexpressed in several cancers, and was transcriptionally repressed after SFN treatment. Knockdown of LINC01116 with siRNA decreased proliferation of prostate cancer cells and significantly up-regulated several genes including GAPDH (regulates glycolysis), MAP1LC3B2 (autophagy) and H2AFY (chromatin structure). A four-fold decrease in the ability of the cancer cells to form colonies was found when the LINC01116 gene was disrupted through a CRISPR/CAS9 method, further supporting an oncogenic function for LINC01116 in PC-3 cells. We identified a novel isoform of LINC01116 and bioinformatically investigated the possibility that LINC01116 could interact with target genes via ssRNA:dsDNA triplexes. Our data reveal that chemicals from the diet can influence the expression of functionally important lncRNAs, and suggest a novel mechanism by which SFN may prevent and suppress prostate cancer.""","""['Laura M Beaver', 'Rachael Kuintzle', 'Alex Buchanan', 'Michelle W Wiley', 'Sarah T Glasser', 'Carmen P Wong', 'Gavin S Johnson', 'Jeff H Chang', 'Christiane V LÃ¶hr', 'David E Williams', 'Roderick H Dashwood', 'David A Hendrix', 'Emily Ho']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nutr Biochem""","""['Transcriptome analysis reveals a dynamic and differential transcriptional response to sulforaphane in normal and prostate cancer cells and suggests a role for Sp1 in chemoprevention.', 'Suppression of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression by sulforaphane and PEITC through IkappaBalpha, IKK pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Sulforaphane Inhibits c-Myc-Mediated Prostate Cancer Stem-Like Traits.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Anticancer Activity of Sulforaphane: The Epigenetic Mechanisms and the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.', 'An overview of natural products that modulate the expression of non-coding RNAs involved in oxidative stress and inflammation-associated disorders.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Non-coding RNAs associated with autophagy and their regulatory role in cancer therapeutics.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Influence of the Bioactive Diet Components on the Gene Expression Regulation.']"""

Coadministration with prednisone has been recommended to prevent the toxicity from secondary mineralocorticoid excess, such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema. However, the use of prednisone is often not desired by patients because of the potential for detrimental effects of long-term therapy with corticosteroids, especially in those with comorbidities such as diabetes or who have received previous immunotherapeutic agents. Eplerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist demonstrated to abrogate mineralocorticoid excess. In the present retrospective study, we report our real-world experience with the use of eplerenone with abiraterone in men with mCRPC who wished to avoid concomitant prednisone therapy.  Patients and methods:   The incidence and grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4) of mineralocorticoid excess toxicities, baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and progression-free survival (PFS) were collected retrospectively. The patient population included men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone, who were not willing to receive corticosteroids, and thus received eplerenone. Their data were compared with the data from those treated with abiraterone and prednisone during the same period. Continuous variables were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Student t test, and categorical variables were assessed using Fischer's exact test or Ï2 test, as appropriate. PFS was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Of the 106 men treated with abiraterone, 40 received eplerenone and 66 received prednisone. The baseline and disease characteristics, incidence and grade of adverse events related to the syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess, and the median PFS were similar in both cohorts.  Conclusion:   In a real-world population of men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone, corticosteroids can be avoided by concomitant treatment with eplerenone.

Materials and methods:   In all, 17 patients with prostate cancer were examined with a 3D multiecho spin echo sequence at 3T prior to undergoing radical prostatectomy. Maps of seven MR parameters, called N, T2-short , T2-long , Ashort , Along , geometric mean T2 time (gmT2 ), and luminal water fraction (LWF), were generated using nonnegative least squares (NNLS) analysis of the T2 decay curves. MR parametric maps were correlated to digitized whole-mount histology sections. Percentage area of tissue components, including luminal space, nuclei, and cytoplasm plus stroma, was measured on the histology sections by using color-based image segmentation. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between MR parameters and the corresponding tissue components, with particular attention paid to the correlation between LWF and percentage area of luminal space.  Results:   N, T2-short , Along , gmT2 , and LWF showed significant correlation (P < 0.05) with percentage area of luminal space and stroma plus cytoplasm. T2-short and gmT2 also showed significant correlation (P < 0.05) with percentage area of nuclei. Overall, the strongest correlation was observed between LWF and luminal space (Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation = 0.75, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Results of this study show that LWF measured with MRI is strongly correlated with the fractional amount of luminal space in prostatic tissue. This result suggests that LWI can potentially be applied for evaluation of prostatic diseases in which the extent of luminal space differs between normal and abnormal tissues.

The biological impact of the time structure is mediated through the Î² parameter in the linear quadratic (LQ) model. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of changes in the value of the Î² parameter on the treatment outcomes, also accounting for noninstantaneous intrafraction dose delivery or fractionation and comparing the effects of using different primary ions.  Methods:   An original formulation of the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) is used (named MCt-MKM), in which a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was introduced to account for the stochastic spatio-temporal correlations characteristic of the irradiations and the cellular repair kinetics. A modified version of the kinetic equations, validated on experimental cell survival in vitro data, was also introduced. The model, trained on the HSG cells, was used to evaluate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for treatments with acute and protracted fractions. Exemplary cases of prostate cancer irradiated with different ion beams were evaluated to assess the impact of the temporal effects.  Results:   The LQ parameters for a range of cell lines (V79, HSG, and T1) and ion species (H, He, C, and Ne) were evaluated and compared with the experimental data available in the literature, with good results. Notably, in contrast to the original MKM formulation, the MCt-MKM explicitly predicts an ion and LET-dependent Î² compatible with observations. The data from a split-dose experiment were used to experimentally determine the value of the parameter related to the cellular repair kinetics. Concerning the clinical case considered, an RBE decrease was observed, depending on the dose, ion, and LET, exceeding up to 3% of the acute value in the case of a protraction in the delivery of 10 min. The intercomparison between different ions shows that the clinical optimality is strongly dependent on a complex interplay between the different physical and biological quantities considered.  Conclusions:   The present study provides a framework for exploiting the temporal effects of dose delivery. The results show the possibility of optimizing the treatment outcomes accounting for the correlation between the specific dose rate time structure and the spatial characteristic of the LET distribution, depending on the ion type used.""","""['Lorenzo Manganaro', 'Germano Russo', 'Roberto Cirio', 'Federico Dalmasso', 'Simona Giordanengo', 'Vincenzo Monaco', 'Silvia Muraro', 'Roberto Sacchi', 'Anna Vignati', 'Andrea Attili']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A modified microdosimetric kinetic model for relative biological effectiveness calculation.', 'Sensitivity study of the microdosimetric kinetic model parameters for carbon ion radiotherapy.', 'Effects of dose-delivery time structure on biological effectiveness for therapeutic carbon-ion beams evaluated with microdosimetric kinetic model.', 'A comparison of mechanism-inspired models for particle relative biological effectiveness (RBE).', 'State-of-the-art and potential of experimental microdosimetry in ion-beam therapy.', 'Impact of DNA Repair Kinetics and Dose Rate on RBE Predictions in the UNIVERSE.', 'Estimate of the Biological Dose in Hadrontherapy Using GATE.', 'Generalized stochastic microdosimetric model: The main formulation.', 'Radiobiological effects of the interruption time with Monte Carlo Simulation on multiple fields in photon beams.', 'Investigation of dose-rate effects and cell-cycle distribution under protracted exposure to ionizing radiation for various dose-rates.']"""

As these declines coincided with the Great Recession, we examined whether they were related to economic conditions.  Methods:   Using California Cancer Registry data from California's 30 most populous counties, we analyzed trends in cancer incidence during pre-recession (1996-2007) and recession/recovery (2008-2012) periods for all cancers combined and the ten most common sites. We evaluated the recession's association with rates using a multifactorial index that measured recession impact, and modeled associations between case counts and county-level unemployment rates using Poisson regression.  Results:   Yearly cancer incidence rate declines were greater during the recession/recovery (3.3% among males, 1.4% among females) than before (0.7 and 0.5%, respectively), particularly for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. Lower case counts, especially for prostate and liver cancer among males and breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer among females, were associated with higher unemployment rates, irrespective of time period, but independent of secular effects. The associations for melanoma translated up to a 3.6% decrease in cases with each 1% increase in unemployment. Incidence declines were not greater in counties with higher recession impact index.  Conclusions:   Although recent declines in incidence of certain cancers are not differentially impacted by economic conditions related to the Great Recession relative to pre-recession conditions, the large recent absolute declines in the case counts of some cancer may be attributable to the large declines in unemployment in the recessionary period. This may occur through decreased engagement in preventive health behaviors, particularly for clinically less urgent cancers. Continued monitoring of trends is important to detect any rises in incidence rates as deferred diagnoses come to clinical attention.""","""['Scarlett Lin Gomez', 'Alison J Canchola', 'David O Nelson', 'Theresa H M Keegan', 'Christina A Clarke', 'Iona Cheng', 'Salma Shariff-Marco', 'Mindy DeRouen', 'Ralph Catalano', 'William A Satariano', 'Kathleen Davidson-Allen', 'Sally L Glaser']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""[""The Great Recession and America's Geography of Unemployment."", 'Did the Great Recession affect mortality rates in the metropolitan United States?

One of the most dramatically downregulated genes identified encodes CYP27A1, an enzyme involved in regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Importantly, lower CYP27A1 transcript levels were associated with shorter disease-free survival and higher tumor grade. Loss of CYP27A1 in prostate cancer was confirmed at the protein level by immunostaining for CYP27A1 in annotated tissue microarrays. Restoration of CYP27A1 expression in cells where its gene was silenced attenuated their growth in vitro and in tumor xenografts. Studies performed in vitro revealed that treatment of prostate cancer cells with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), an enzymatic product of CYP27A1, reduced cellular cholesterol content in prostate cancer cell lines by inhibiting the activation of sterol regulatory-element binding protein 2 and downregulating low-density lipoprotein receptor expression. Our findings suggest that CYP27A1 is a critical cellular cholesterol sensor in prostate cells and that dysregulation of the CYP27A1/27HC axis contributes significantly to prostate cancer pathogenesis.

In the design and synthesis of these analogs, the following previous substitutions were conserved: D-Arg2, Har9, Abu15, and Nle27. Most new analogs had Ala at position 8. Since replacements of both Lys12 and Lys21 with Orn increased resistance against enzymatic degradation, these modifications were kept. The substitutions of Arg at both positions 11 and 20 by His were also conserved. We kept D-Arg28, Har29 -NH2 at the C-terminus or inserted Agm or 12-amino dodecanoic acid amide at position 30. We incorporated pentafluoro-Phe (Fpa5), instead of Cpa, at position 6 and Tyr(Me) at position 10 and Ï-amino acids at N-terminus of some analogs. These GHRH analogs were prepared by solid-phase methodology and purified by HPLC. The evaluation of the activity of the analogs on GH release was carried out in vitro on rat pituitaries and in vivo in male rats. Receptor binding affinities were measured in vitro by the competitive binding analysis. The inhibitory activity of the analogs on tumor proliferation in vitro was tested in several human cancer cell lines such as HEC-1A endometrial adenocarcinoma, HCT-15 colorectal adenocarcinoma, and LNCaP prostatic carcinoma. For in vivo tests, various cell lines including PC-3 prostate cancer, HEC-1A endometrial adenocarcinoma, HT diffuse mixed Î² cell lymphoma, and ACHN renal cell carcinoma cell lines were xenografted into nude mice and treated subcutaneously with GHRH antagonists at doses of 1-5Î¼g/day. Analogs MIA-602, MIA-604, MIA-610, and MIA-640 showed the highest binding affinities, 30, 58, 48, and 73 times higher respectively, than GHRH (1-29) NH2. Treatment of LNCaP and HCT-15 cells with 5Î¼M MIA-602 or MIA-690 decreased proliferation by 40%-80%. In accord with previous tests in various human cancer lines, analog MIA-602 showed high inhibitory activity in vivo on growth of PC-3 prostate cancer, HT-mixed Î² cell lymphoma, HEC-1A endometrial adenocarcinoma and ACHN renal cell carcinoma. Thus, GHRH analogs of the Miami series powerfully suppress tumor growth, but have only a weak endocrine GH inhibitory activity.

We evaluated the impact of adding radical retropubic prostatectomy to surgical castration on long-term oncologic outcomes in pathological node positive prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We identified men who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and orchiectomy within 90 days for pathological node positive prostate cancer from 1966 to 1995. Men treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy in addition to orchiectomy were matched 1:1 to men who underwent orchiectomy alone based on age, year of surgery, clinical grade, clinical T stage, number of positive nodes and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen, the latter from 1987 and thereafter. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were done to compare cancer specific and overall survival.  Results:   The matched cohort included 158 men with 79 in each group. Of men who underwent orchiectomy alone 76 died, including 60 of prostate cancer. Of patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy plus orchiectomy 70 died, including 28 of prostate cancer. On Kaplan-Meier analyses prostatectomy plus orchiectomy vs orchiectomy alone was associated with prolonged cancer specific survival (at 20 years 59% vs 18%, log rank p <0.001) and overall survival (at 20 years 22% vs 9%, log rank p <0.001). In Cox models prostatectomy plus orchiectomy vs orchiectomy alone was associated with improved cancer specific survival (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.46, p <0.001) and overall survival (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34-0.66, p <0.001). Findings were similar in the subset with available preoperative prostate specific antigen values.  Conclusions:   With lifelong followup in nearly the entire cohort, this study demonstrates that adding radical retropubic prostatectomy to surgical castration for pathological node positive prostate cancer is associated with improved cancer specific and overall survival.

Patients were treated to 65Gy/25Fr/5 weeks (n = 18), or 60Gy/20Fr/4 weeks (n = 83). Most (82.2%) had high-risk or pelvic node-positive disease. Acute toxicity was assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute morbidity scoring criteria. Dose thresholds for acute rectal and bladder toxicity were identified.  Results:   The incidence of acute grade 2 GI toxicity was 20.8%, and grade 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity was 6.9%. No Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred. Small bowel toxicity was uncommon (Gr 2 = 4%). The 2Gy equivalent doses (EQD2) to the rectum and bladder (Î±/Î² = 3) calculated showed that the absolute doses were more consistent predictors of acute toxicities than the relative volumes. Those with grade 2 or more GI symptoms had significantly higher VEQD2-60Gy (13.2 vs 9.9cc, p = 0.007) and VEQD2-50Gy (20.6 vs 15.4cc, p = 0.005). Those with grade 2 or more GU symptoms had significantly higher VEQD2-70Gy (30.4 vs 18.4cc, p = 0.001) and VEQD2-65Gy (44.0 vs 28.8cc, p = 0.001).

Objective:   To develop and evaluate a systematic approach for physicians to counsel patients with low-risk prostate cancer to increase acceptance of AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   A systematic counseling approach was developed and piloted in one clinic. Then five surgeons participated in a 1-h training session in which they learned about the approach. A total of 1003 patients with Gleason 3+3 prostate cancer were included in the study. We compared AS rates for 761 patients who were counseled over a 24-mo period before the training intervention with AS rates for 242 patients who were counseled over a 12-mo period afterwards, controlling for temporal trends and case mix.  Intervention:   A systematic approach for communicating the merits of AS using appropriate framing techniques derived from principles studied by negotiation scholars.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The rate of AS acceptance by patients for management of low-risk prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   In the pilot phase, 81 of 86 patients (94%) accepted AS after counseling by the physician who developed the counseling approach. In the subsequent study, the cohort for the training intervention comprised 1003 consecutive patients, 80% of whom met the Epstein criteria for very low-risk disease. The proportion of patients who selected AS increased from 69% before the training intervention to 81% afterwards. After adjusting for time trends and case mix, the rate of AS after the intervention was 9.1% higher (95% confidence interval -0.4% to 19.4%) than expected, a relative reduction of approximately 30% in the risk of unnecessary curative treatment.  Conclusions:   A systematic approach to counseling can be taught to physicians in a 1-h lecture. We found evidence that even this minimal intervention can decrease overtreatment. Our novel approach offers a framework to help address cancer screening-related overtreatment that occurs across medicine.  Patient summary:   In this study, we evaluated the impact of teaching physicians how to better communicate the benefits and risks of prostate cancer treatments on the willingness of patients to choose active surveillance. Decisions related to cancer are often guided by emotions and biases that lead most patients to seek radical treatment; however, we demonstrated that if discussions are framed differently, these biases can be overcome and more patients will choose active surveillance.""","""['Behfar Ehdaie', 'Melissa Assel', 'Nicole Benfante', 'Deepak Malhotra', 'Andrew Vickers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Active Surveillance Discussion for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Patients' Preferences and Counseling Techniques."", 'Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Contemporary use of initial active surveillance among men in Michigan with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Describing perspectives of health care professionals on active surveillance for the management of prostate cancer.', 'A Narrative Overview of Active Surveillance for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Does a brief surgeon training in negotiation theory principles decrease rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy?', 'Assessing Quality and Safety of an Advanced Practice Provider-led Active Surveillance Clinic for Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing the problem of overtreatment in breast cancer.', 'Treatment on active surveillance of small renal masses: Progression vs. preference.', 'Impact of a Genomic Test on Treatment Decision in a Predominantly African American Population With Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Trial.']"""

The American Cancer Society estimated that for the year 2016 the number of prostate cancer deaths will be 26,120. Thus, there is a critical need for novel approaches to treat this deadly disease. Using high-throughput small-molecule screening, we found that the small molecule 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) significantly improves the targeting of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) delivered by gymnosis (i.e., in the absence of any transfection reagents) in both the cell cytoplasm and the nucleus. Furthermore, as a single agent, 6BIO had the unexpected ability to simultaneously downregulate androgen receptor (AR) expression and AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. This includes downregulating levels of the AR-V7, a drug-resistance-related AR splice variant that is important in the progression of prostate cancer. Combining 6BIO and an anti-AR oligonucleotide (AR-ASO) can augment the downregulation of AR expression. We also demonstrated that 6BIO enhances ASO function and represses AR expression through the inhibition of the two main glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) isoforms: GSK-3Î± and GSK-3Î² activity. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of 6BIO as a single agent or as part of a combinatorial ASO-based therapy in the treatment of human prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaowei Zhang', 'Daniela Castanotto', 'Sangkil Nam', 'David Horne', 'Cy Stein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['Proliferative and androgenic effects of indirubin derivatives in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells at sub-apoptotic concentrations.', 'Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² counteracts ligand-independent activity of the androgen receptor in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta promotes nuclear export of the androgen receptor through a CRM1-dependent mechanism in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Glycogen synthase kinase-3: a potential preventive target for prostate cancer management.', 'Simultaneous inhibition of endocytic recycling and lysosomal fusion sensitizes cells and tissues to oligonucleotide therapeutics.', 'Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes as Nanomaterial Tool in the Management of Prostate Cancer: A Possible Nanoformulation Approach.', 'Decrypting a path based approach for identifying the interplay between PI3K and GSK3 signaling cascade from the perspective of cancer.', 'Targeting a splicing-mediated drug resistance mechanism in prostate cancer by inhibiting transcriptional regulation by PKCÎ²1.', 'Oximes: Novel Therapeutics with Anticancer and Anti-Inflammatory Potential.']"""

To target pancreatic cancer, we generated CAR T cells directed against prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) and demonstrated specific tumor lysis. However, pancreatic tumors employ immune evasion strategies such as the production of inhibitory cytokines, which limit CAR T cell persistence and function. Thus, to protect our cells from the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-4, we generated an inverted cytokine receptor in which the IL-4 receptor exodomain was fused to the IL-7 receptor endodomain (4/7 ICR). Transgenic expression of this molecule in CAR-PSCA T cells should invert the inhibitory effects of tumor-derived IL-4 and instead promote T cell proliferation. We now demonstrate the suppressed activity of CAR T cells in tumor-milieu conditions and the ability of CAR/ICR T cells to thrive in an IL-4-rich microenvironment, resulting in enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, CAR/ICR T cells remained both antigen and cytokine dependent.

As experience is gained with the RARC approach the technique is being applied to more complex surgical cases. We describe here our technique for RARC with intracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversion for a renal transplant recipient.  Materials and methods:   The patient is a 60-year old man with high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer. He has a history of renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease and received a deceased donor renal transplant in 2008. His hospital course at time of transplant was complicated by low-level BK virus viremia. Interestingly his trans-urethral bladder tumor resection specimen at time of bladder cancer diagnosis stained positive for SV40. His native kidneys were anuric so bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed in a staged fashion 2 weeks prior to RARC. Our surgical technique utilizes 6 trocars, of note a 12-mm assistant trocar is placed 1 cm superior to the pubic symphysis, and this trocar is solely used to pass a laparoscopic stapler to facilitate the excision of the ileal segment and the stapled enteric anastomosis. Surgical steps include: identification of native ureters bilaterally (removed en bloc with the bladder specimen); identification of the transplanted ureter at the right bladder dome; posterior bladder and prostate dissection along Denonvilliers' fascia; development of the space of Retzius; ligation and transection of the bladder and prostate vascular bundles; apical prostate dissection and transection of urethra; left pelvic lymphadenectomy; ilium resection for creation of the ileal conduit; stapled enteric anastomosis; ureteroileal anastomosis; maturation of the ileal conduit stoma.  Results:   The surgery had no intraoperative complications. Operative time was 443 minutes (7.4 hours). Estimated blood loss was 250 cc. Length of hospital stay was 5 days. The patient did not experience any postoperative complications. The patient maintained good renal graft function with no decline in eGFR to date.  Conclusions:   As surgeon comfort and experience with robotic assisted surgery grows, robotic surgery can successfully be applied to less frequently performed procedures. Here we successfully performed a robotic assisted radical cystoprostatectomy with intracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversion for a renal transplant recipient.""","""['Peter A Caputo', 'Daniel Ramirez', 'Matthew Maurice', 'Ryan Nelson', 'Onder Kara', 'Ercan Malkoc', 'David Goldfarb', 'Jihad Kaouk']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Single-Port Trans-Perineal Approach to Cystoprostatectomy with Intracorporeal Ileal Conduit Urinary Diversion and Lymph-Nodes Dissection using a Purpose-Built Robotic System: Surgical Steps in a Preclinical Model.', 'Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Bilateral Nerve Sparing and Apex Preserving Cystoprostatectomy in Young Men With Bladder Cancer.', 'Robot-assisted nerve-sparing radical cystectomy with bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and intracorporeal urinary diversion for bladder cancer: initial experience in 27 cases.', 'Utility of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Is robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal diversion becoming the new gold standard of care?', 'Radical cystectomy, bilateral lymphadenectomy and native ureteral ligation in a patient with history of kidney transplantation.', 'Urological Cancers and Kidney Transplantation: a Literature Review.', 'Management of a ureteric stricture post ureteroileal anastomosis of a renal transplant.']"""

Patients with abnormal digital rectal examination and/or total prostate specific antigen (PSA) over 4ng/mL underwent TRUSB with 12 cores. Serum samples were obtained before and just after the procedure to evaluate the possible changes in thiol/disulphide homeostasis. Mean age, total PSA and free PSA, prostate volume and histopathological data were also recorded.  Results:   Mean age of the study population was 65.05Â±8.89 years. Significant decreases in native and total thiol levels were documented after the biopsy procedure. However, serum disulphide levels and disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native / total thiol ratios did not significantly change after TRUSB. No correlation was observed between oxidative parameters and total PSA and free PSA levels, prostate volume and histopathology of the prostate. However, mean patient age was significantly correlated with mean native and total thiol levels.

Recent studies have identified CACNA1B (Cav2.2) being overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues; however, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been investigated. In this study, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of CACNA1B (Cav2.2) in NSCLC tumorous and adjacent nontumorous tissues by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis (TMA-IHC), respectively. CACNA1B (Cav2.2) protein expressions in tumorous tissues were correlated with NSCLC patients' clinical characteristics and overall survival. CACNA1B (Cav2.2) mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues than in nontumorous tissues.

Methods:   We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for cancer specific confounders, in 6831 self-reported cancer cases and 1992 self-reported cancer-free controls from the Cancer Lifestyle and Evaluation of Risk Study, using unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   For women, BMI was positively associated with UC risk; specifically, obese women (BMIâ¥30kg/m2) had nearly twice the risk of developing UC compared to women with healthy-BMI-range (<25kg/m2) (OR=1.99;CI:1.31-3.03).

Another variable to consider in this ongoing fight is treatment machine complexity that leads to elevated development and purchasing cost, leading to a reduced use. Reducing the complexity (in hopes of lowering costs) would benefit underdeveloped, low- and middle-income countries by introducing newer treatment technology, as their currently accepted standards do not meet standards of more advanced, developed countries. In this study, unilateral head and neck (H&N), and prostate cases using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were tested with multiple segment widths of 5, 10, 15, and 20mm to create treatable plans.

Results show that altering the MLC widths from 5 through 20mm produces both comparable and treatable plans up to 99% and 98% target coverage for H&N and prostate, respectively, albeit clinically significant hot spots were shown to increase with increasing segment width.

In turn, they bind to and activate effector proteins such as PI3K, leading to various cell responses including cell proliferation. We had reported that ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 induces mono-ubiquitination of IRS-2, thereby enhancing IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to increased IGF signaling and mitogenic activity. Here we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) antagonizes the effect of Nedd4 on IRS-2. We identified USP15 as a protein that preferentially bound to IRS-2 when IRS-2 was conjugated with ubiquitin. In HEK293 cells, Nedd4 overexpression induced IRS-2 ubiquitination, which was decreased by USP15 co-expression while increased by USP15 knockdown. Nedd4 overexpression enhanced IGF-I-dependent IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and USP15 co-expression suppressed it. Conversely, USP15 knockdown increased IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

Methods and materials:   For 613 patients, EGSnrc BrachyDose dose calculations were performed in 2 virtual patient models: TG43sim (simulated American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group Report 43 conditions) and MCref (computed tomography-derived heterogeneous tissue model with interseed effects). A sensitivity analysis was performed in a patient subset (25 with and 25 without prostatic calcifications) to explore dose calculation dependence on organ-at-risk (OAR) and calcification tissue elemental compositions and modelling approach.  Results:   In the target volume, the minimum radiation dose delivered to 90% of prostate (D90) (volume of prostate receiving at least 100% of prescription dose [V100]) was lower with MCref than with TG43sim by 5.9% Â± 1.6% (2.6% Â± 1.7%), on average. Patients with prostatic calcifications can have substantial underdosed volumes due to calcification shielding, lowering the D90 by â¤25%. In the urethra, the average D5 (D30) was lower with MCref than with TG43sim by 4.4% Â± 1.8% (4.7% Â± 1.9%). In the rectum (bladder), the minimum dose to the hottest 0.1 cm3 (D_0.1cm3) of the contoured organ was lower (higher) with MCref than with TG43sim by 5.2% Â± 1.8% (1.3% Â± 1.8%). Doses to the target and OARs can increase or decrease by several percentages, depending on the assumed tissue elemental composition. In patients with calcifications, differences between approaches to model calcifications can change the target and OAR dose metrics by upward of 10%.  Conclusions:   TG43sim typically overestimates the target and OAR doses by several percentages, on average, compared with MCref. The considerable variation in the relative TG43sim and MCref doses between patients, and the larger dose differences for patients with calcification, suggests that clinical adoption of Monte Carlo dose calculations for permanent implant prostate brachytherapy should be pursued. The substantial sensitivity of the Monte Carlo dose calculations to the patient modelling approach supports the adoption of a consensus modelling scheme, such as MCref described in the present study, to ensure consistency of practice.""","""['Nelson Miksys', 'Eric Vigneault', 'Andre-Guy Martin', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Rowan M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetric investigation of 103Pd permanent breast seed implant brachytherapy based on Monte Carlo calculations.', 'Investigation of interseed attenuation and tissue composition effects in (125)I seed implant prostate brachytherapy.', 'Coupling I-125 permanent implant prostate brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations with radiobiological models.', 'Permanent implant prostate cancer brachytherapy: 2013 state-of-the art.', 'The influence of tissue composition uncertainty on dose distributions in brachytherapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   The study includes patients with biochemical failure after postprostatectomy RT who underwent CholPET between 2008 and 2015. Patient and disease characteristics were examined in relation to sites of recurrence. All RT dosimetry records were reviewed, and recurrences were mapped on a representative computed tomography dataset with their relationship relative to the irradiated fossa field as out of field (OOF), edge of field (EOF; recurrence within <45-Gy isodose lines), or in field (IF; recurrence within â¥45-Gy isodose lines).  Results:   Forty-one patients were identified with 121 sites of recurrence (median 2 sites; interquartile range [IQR], 1-4). The median prostate-specific antigen level at CholPET was 3.1 (IQR, 1.9-5.6) ng/mL. Median interval from RT to biochemical failure was 24 (IQR, 10-46) months, with recurrence identified on CholPET at a median of 15 (IQR, 7-28) months from biochemical failure. Histologic confirmation of recurrence was obtained in 20 patients (49%), with the remainder confirmed by treatment response. Five patients (12%) had IF recurrences, 10 patients (24%) had EOF recurrences (median dose 10 Gy; IQR, 5-30 Gy), and 36 patients (88%) had OOF recurrences. Ten patients had combination failures: 6 (15%) EOF/OOF and 4 (10%) IF/OOF. Fifty-seven recurrences (47%) were pelvic nodal sites inferior to the L5-S1 interspace, of which 52 (43%) were within a pelvic RT field. Eighty-one recurrences (67%) were nodal and inferior to the aortic bifurcation.  Conclusions:   Using CholPET, we found that the majority of patients evaluated for biochemical failure recurred outside of the postprostatectomy RT field. Furthermore, most recurrence sites were nodal and inferior to the aortic bifurcation.

We evaluated treatment regret and patients' perceptions of their treatment experiences to better inform our understanding of a treatment's value.  Methods and materials:   Patients with localized prostate cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy between 2008 and 2014 with at least 1 year of follow-up were surveyed. The questionnaire explored the decision-making experience, expectations of toxicities versus the reality, and treatment regret by means of a validated tool.  Results:   Three hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients were surveyed, with an 86% response rate (IMRT, n=74; SBRT, n=108; HDR, n=94). The median patient age and posttreatment follow-up time were 68 years and 47 months, respectively. Eighty-two percent of patients had T1c disease with either Gleason 6 (42%) or Gleason 7 (58%) pathologic features and a median initial prostate-specific antigen of 5.8 ng/mL. Thirteen percent expressed regret with their treatment. Among patients with regret, 71% now wish they had elected for active surveillance. The incidence of regret was significantly different between treatment modalities: 5% of patients treated with SBRT expressed regret versus 18% with HDR and 19% with IMRT (P<.01). On multivariable logistic regression, patients treated with HDR versus SBRT were 7.42 times more likely to have regret, and patients treated with IMRT versus SBRT were 11.11 times more likely to have regret (P<.01 and P<.01, respectively). Significantly more patients treated with SBRT selected that their actual long-term toxicities were significantly less than originally expected, compared with IMRT and HDR patients (SBRT 43% vs IMRT 20% vs HDR 10%, P<.01).  Conclusions:   We found significant differences in patients' experiences between SBRT, IMRT, and HDR, with significantly less treatment regret and less toxicity than expected among SBRT patients.

Our primary objective was to determine differences in response to AA between B and W patients.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective case-control study of B vs. W patients treated with AA between May 1, 2008 and June 16, 2015 at Duke University Medical Center. Patients were identified (W control patients were matched 2:1 to B patients stratified based on previous docetaxel exposure) through pharmacy records and were eligible if treated with AA for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients with previous enzalutamide use were excluded. The primary objective was to compare the rate ofâ¥90% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline between B vs. W patients. Secondary outcomes included comparing time on therapy, time to PSA progression, and overall survival among groups.  Results:   Baseline characteristics among patients (n = 45 B, n = 90 W) were identified; these included Karnofsky performance status, PSA, Gleason score, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, opiate use for pain, and metastatic sites. Baseline characteristics among groups were similar except for median hemoglobin (B = 11.4g/dl, W = 12.3g/dl). The proportion of B patients achieving aâ¥90% PSA level decline was 37.8% vs. 28.9% for W patients (P = 0.296).

The psychological aspects of prostate biopsy have been somewhat neglected. The aim of this study was to explore the level of regret experienced by men after prostate biopsy and identify any associated factors.  Methods:   Men attending four clinics in Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland were given a questionnaire to explore their experience of prostate biopsy. Regret was measured on a Likert scale asking men how much they agreed with the statement ""It [the biopsy] is something I regret.""  Results:   Three hundred thirty-five men responded to the survey. The mean age was 63 years (SD Â±7 years). Three quarters of respondents (76%) were married or co-habiting, and (75%) finished education at primary or secondary school level. For just over two thirds of men (70%) their recent biopsy represented their first ever prostate biopsy. Approximately one third of men reported a diagnosis of cancer, one third a negative biopsy result, and the remaining third did not know their result. Two thirds of men reported intermediate or high health anxiety. 5.1% of men agreed or strongly agreed that they regretted the biopsy.  Conclusions:   Level of regret was low overall. Health anxiety was the only significant predictor of regret, with men with higher anxiety reporting higher levels of regret than men with low anxiety (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.58, 5.84).

In this context, we explored combined expression of PCa related target genes AMACR and PCA3 in 126 formalin fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissues (FFPE) from Moroccan patients, using quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR). This quantification required data normalization accomplished using stably expressed reference genes (RGs). A panel of twelve RG was assessed, data being analyzed using GenEx V6 based on geNorm, NormFinder and statistical methods. Accordingly, the hnRNP A1 gene was identified and selected as the most stably expressed RG for reliable and accurate gene expression quantification in prostate tissues. The ratios of both PCA3 and AMACR gene expression relative to that of the hnRNP A1 gene were calculated and the performance of each target gene for PCa diagnosis was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics.
