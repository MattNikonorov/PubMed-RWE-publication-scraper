Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 793 consecutive patients who were treated with RARP at our institution. Patients were divided into three groups, according to TI, to compare BCR-free survival (BCRFS) rates: Group 1 (n = 196), TI < 3 months; Group 2 (n = 513), 3 ≤ TI < 6 months; Group 3 (n = 84), TI ≥ 6 months. Eighty-three patients with TI ≥ 6 months were matched with an equal number of patients with TI < 6 months based on propensity scores by using four preoperative factors: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), primary (pGS) and secondary (sGS) Gleason score and positive prostate biopsy.  Results:   The 5-year BCRFS rates for TI Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 76%, 80.7% and 82.6% (P = 0.99), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that PSA, pGS, sGS and a positive prostate biopsy were independent preoperative risk factors for BCR. The propensity adjusted 5-year BCRFS for patients with TI ≥ 6 months was 84.0%. This was not worse than that of patients with TI < 6 months (71.0%, P = 0.18).  Conclusions:   In our cohorts, a delay in the time from biopsy to RARP did not significantly affect recurrence. Therefore, hasty treatment decisions are unnecessary for at least 6 months after diagnosis of early prostate cancer.""","""['Yosuke Hirasawa', 'Makoto Ohori', 'Toru Sugihara', 'Takeshi Hashimoto', 'Naoya Satake', 'Tatsuo Gondo', 'Yoshihiro Nakagami', 'Kazunori Namiki', 'Kunihiko Yoshioka', 'Jun Nakashima', 'Masaaki Tachibana', 'Yoshio Ohno']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative prognostic factors for biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in Japan.', 'Oncologic outcomes at 10 years following robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Effects of Delayed Radical Prostatectomy and Active Surveillance on Localised Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Does time interval between prostate biopsy and surgery affect outcomes of radical prostatectomy?

Methods:   In this retrospective study, we reviewed the clinical and pathological records of 431 consecutive patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who underwent RCP at Hirosaki University. Of these, we focused on 237 male patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and digital rectal examinations (DRE) that were recorded prior to the RCP. Significant PCa was defined as a tumor with a Gleason 4 or 5 pattern, pathological T3 or higher stage, lymph node involvement or three or more multifocal lesions within the prostate specimen. We compared clinically significant and insignificant PCa.  Results:   In this study, a total of 43 patients (18.1%) were diagnosed with incidental PCa via RCP specimens. Age, preoperative PSA levels and pathological T stage in patients with clinically significant PCa were considerably higher than in those with insignificant cancer. Apical involvement was found in 16 patients, including 11 of those with clinically significant PCa. By the end of the follow-up period, none of the enrolled patients had a biochemical recurrence after surgery or died from PCa.  Conclusion:   According to our findings, preoperative risk factors were not reliable enough to accurately predict clinically significant PCa. Although there was no biochemical relapse or clinical recurrence of PCa in this study, the potential oncologic risk of prostate-sparing RCP must be considered.""","""['Toshikazu Tanaka', 'Takuya Koie', 'Chikara Ohyama', 'Yasuhiro Hashimoto', 'Atsushi Imai', 'Yuki Tobisawa', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Hayato Yamamoto', 'Tohru Yoneyama', 'Hirotaka Horiguchi', 'Hirotake Kodama', 'Takahiro Yoneyama']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Relevance of prostate cancer in patients with synchronous invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma: a monocentric retrospective analysis.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in radical cystoprostatectomy specimens.', 'Incidental prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy: implications for apex-sparing surgery.', 'Do we use the right criteria for determining the clinical significance of incidental prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy?', 'Prognostic influence of prostate gland invasion by bladder tumour and/or prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomy specimen: a review.', 'Neobladder ""Function"": Tips and Tricks for Surgery and Postoperative Management.', 'Prevalence and risk factors of incidental prostate cancer in certain surgeries for benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

In this study, we investigated whether tissue metabolites detectable by high-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS MRS) were associated with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective ex vivo study using HR-MAS MRS on tissue samples from 110 radical prostatectomy specimens obtained from three different Norwegian cohorts collected between 2002 and 2010.

High total IGF-1R associated with high primary Gleason grade and risk of metastasis, and cytoplasmic and internalised IGF-1R with biochemical recurrence, which includes patients experiencing local recurrence within the radiation field indicating radioresistance. In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic, internalised and total IGF-1R were independently associated with risk of overall recurrence, and cytoplasmic IGF-1R was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence post radiotherapy.

In the present study, LNCaP cells were knocked down of AhR by siRNA, or treated with the AhR agonist 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). The effects of AhR on LNCaP cells and the associated mechanisms were studied both under normal condition and under hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress. MTT, transwell chamber assays and flow cytometry were employed to investigate cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, respectively, whereas the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling (phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated [ATM], check-point kinase 2 [Chk2], histone H2AX, p53, and cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase [PARP]) was detected by western blotting. Exposure of LNCaP cells to H2O2 inhibited their viability and migration, and induced apoptosis, at a greater extent compared with the culture under normal conditions. In addition, the oxidative stress increased p-ATM, p-Chk2, p-p53, and p-H2AX expression levels significantly. Knockdown of AhR attenuated the aforementioned effects caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Activation of AhR by 3MC treatment, further aggravated these changes of LNCaP cells on oxidative stress. The findings indicated that AhR suppresses the viability and migration of LNCaP cells notably under oxidative stress, and this process is associated with positive regulation of the responses to oxidative DNA damage.""","""['Jing-Song Yu', 'Peng-Fei Leng', 'Yi-Fu Li', 'Yong-Quan Wang', 'Yan Wang', 'Rui-Hua An', 'Ji-Ping Qi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['Testosterone promotes DNA damage response under oxidative stress in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis against oxidative damage in human melanocytes.', 'Activation of p53 in Human and Murine Cells by DNA-Damaging Agents Differentially Regulates Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Levels.', 'Air particulate matter induced oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis: The role of Nrf2 and AhR-mediated pathways.', 'Antioxidants for Healthy Skin: The Emerging Role of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptors and Nuclear Factor-Erythroid 2-Related Factor-2.', 'HPV infection associated DNA damage correlated with cervical precancerous lesions and cancer in the highest area of cervical cancer mortality, Longnan, China.', 'Differentially Expressed Genes and Molecular Pathways in an Autochthonous Mouse Prostate Cancer Model.']"""

NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3.1), an androgen-regulated prostate-specific transcription factor, suppresses tumors in prostate cancer, but its role in HCC is unknown, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, the differential expression analyses in HCC tissues and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues revealed that NKX3.1 is frequently down-regulated in human primary HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. We also noted that NKX3.1 significantly inhibits proliferation and mobility of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, NKX3.1 overexpression resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase via direct binding to the promoter of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and up-regulation of expression. Of note, FOXO1 silencing in NKX3.1-overexpressing cells reversed the inhibitory effects of NKX3.1 on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Consistently, both FOXO1 and NKX3.1 were down-regulated in human HCC tissues, and their expression was significantly and positively correlated with each other.

Thapsigargin (Tg) blocks the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis, and causes cell death. However, the exact mechanisms whereby SERCA inhibition induces cell death are incompletely understood. Here, we report that low (0.1 μm) concentrations of Tg and Tg analogs with various long-chain substitutions at the O-8 position extensively inhibit SERCA1a-mediated Ca2+ transport. We also found that, in both prostate and breast cancer cells, exposure to Tg or Tg analogs for 1 day caused extensive drainage of the ER Ca2+ stores. This Ca2+ depletion was followed by markedly reduced cell proliferation rates and morphological changes that developed over 2-4 days and culminated in cell death. Interestingly, these changes were not accompanied by bulk increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Moreover, knockdown of two key store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) components, Orai1 and STIM1, did not reduce Tg cytotoxicity, indicating that SOCE and Ca2+ entry are not critical for Tg-induced cell death. However, we observed a correlation between the abilities of Tg and Tg analogs to deplete ER Ca2+ stores and their detrimental effects on cell viability. Furthermore, caspase activation and cell death were associated with a sustained unfolded protein response. We conclude that ER Ca2+ drainage and sustained unfolded protein response activation are key for initiation of apoptosis at low concentrations of Tg and Tg analogs, whereas high cytosolic Ca2+ levels and SOCE are not required.""","""['Pankaj Sehgal', 'Paula Szalai', 'Claus Olesen', 'Helle A Praetorius', 'Poul Nissen', 'Søren Brøgger Christensen', 'Nikolai Engedal', 'Jesper V Møller']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Nonlinear relationship between ER Ca2+ depletion versus induction of the unfolded protein response, autophagy inhibition, and cell death.', 'Paradoxical effects of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activator gingerol on NG115-401L neuronal cells: failure to augment ER Ca(2+) uptake and protect against ER stress-induced cell death.', 'Differential effects of thapsigargin analogues on apoptosis of prostate cancer cells: complex regulation by intracellular calcium.', 'Regulation and Role of Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry in Cellular Proliferation.', 'Privileged coupling between Ca(2+) entry through plasma membrane store-operated Ca(2+) channels and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump.', 'Isolation and Biological Activity of Iezoside and Iezoside B, SERCA Inhibitors from Floridian Marine Cyanobacteria.', 'Quantitative Measurement of Secretory Protein Mistargeting by Proximity Labeling and Parallel Reaction Monitoring.', 'ER Ca2+ overload activates the IRE1α signaling and promotes cell survival.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tocotrienol-Mediated Anticancer Properties: A Systematic Review of the Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Unfolded Protein Response.', ""Targeting alarmin release reverses Sjogren's syndrome phenotype by revitalizing Ca2+ signalling.""]"""

Here, we present a large discrepancy between prostate cancer risk stratified as high risk on biopsy and their pathology after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 1424 men who underwent either open or robotic-assisted prostatectomy between 2004 and 2015. We analyzed 148 men who were diagnosed with HGS 8 on prostate biopsy. Biopsy and prostatectomy pathology were compared in aggregate and over 1 year time intervals. Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   A total of 61.5% (91/148) of clinical HGS 8 diagnoses were downgraded on prostatectomy, with 58.8% (87/148) downgraded to Gleason 7 (Gleason 4 + 3 n = 59; Gleason 3 + 4 n = 28). Factors associated with downgrading include lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at biopsy (median 6.8 ng/mL versus 9.1 ng/mL, p < 0.001), number of Gleason 8 biopsy cores (median 1 versus 2, p < 0.02), presence of Gleason pattern 3 on biopsy cores (67.9% versus 44.8%, p < 0.03), pT2 staging (72.4% versus 55.1%, p < 0.04), positive margins (53.9% versus 69.1%, p < 0.04), extracapsular extension (53.4% versus 74.1%, p < 0.02), and smaller percent tumor (median 10% versus 15%, p < 0.004).

Methods:   We explored this issue in a mixed methods study with 53 adult survivors of 3 cancers (breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), living in Maryland. Participants provided three 24-hour dietary recalls, and results were used to classify respondents on 2 metrics of healthful eating (the Healthy Eating Index 2010, and a 9-item index based on current dietary recommendations). Recalls were also used to guide in-depth qualitative discussions with participants regarding self-assessment of dietary behaviors, healthful eating, and diet's importance in cancer prevention and survivorship.  Results:   Survivors following a more healthful diet were more likely to be female, have greater socioeconomic resources, more years since diagnosis, normal weight, and no smoking history. Qualitative discussions revealed a more nuanced understanding of dietary strategies among healthful eaters, as well as the importance of household members in dietary decision making.

However, studies using male pattern baldness as a proxy of early-life or cumulative androgen exposure have reported significant associations with aggressive and fatal prostate cancer risk. Given that androgens underlie the development of patterned hair loss and chest hair, we assessed whether these two dermatological characteristics were associated with circulating and intraprostatic concentrations of sex steroid hormones among men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We included 248 prostate cancer patients from the NCI Prostate Tissue Study, who answered surveys and provided a pre-treatment blood sample as well as fresh frozen adjacent normal prostate tissue. Male pattern baldness and chest hair density were assessed by trained nurses before surgery. General linear models estimated geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of each hormone variable by dermatological phenotype with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Subgroup analyses were performed by Gleason score (<7 vs ≥7) and race (European American vs. African American).  Results:   We found strong positive associations of balding status with serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and a weak association with elevated intraprostatic testosterone. Conversely, neither circulating nor intraprostatic sex hormones were statistically significantly associated with chest hair density. Age-adjusted correlation between binary balding status and three-level chest hair density was weak (r = 0.05). There was little evidence to suggest that Gleason score or race modified these associations.  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence that balding status assessed at a mean age of 60 years may serve as a clinical marker for circulating sex hormone concentrations. The weak-to-null associations between balding status and intraprostatic sex hormones reaffirm differences in organ-specific sex hormone metabolism, implying that other sex steroid hormone-related factors (eg, androgen receptor) play important roles in organ-specific androgenic actions, and that other overlapping pathways may be involved in associations between the two complex conditions.""","""['Cindy Ke Zhou', 'Frank Z Stanczyk', 'Muhannad Hafi', 'Carmela C Veneroso', 'Barlow Lynch', 'Roni T Falk', 'Shelley Niwa', 'Eric Emanuel', 'Yu-Tang Gao', 'George P Hemstreet', 'Ladan Zolfghari', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Michael J Manyak', 'Isabell A Sesterhenn', 'Paul H Levine', 'Ann W Hsing', 'Michael B Cook']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prospective study of sex hormone levels and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Relationships between Circulating and Intraprostatic Sex Steroid Hormone Concentrations.', 'Sex steroid hormones and the androgen receptor gene CAG repeat and subsequent risk of prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era.', 'The epidemiology of sex steroid hormones and their signaling and metabolic pathways in the etiology of prostate cancer.', 'The endocrinology of baldness.', 'TGF-β controls stromal telomere length through epigenetic modifications.', 'Determination of Intraprostatic and Intratesticular Androgens.', 'Baldness and Risk of Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'ERG Tumor Type is Less Frequent in High Grade and High Stage Prostate Cancers of Chinese Men.']"""

Increasing evidence has indicated PSCA plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, its function and the underlying molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) are still not fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of PSCA on cell cycle of PCa cells and its mechanism research.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to quantify PSCA expression pattern in PCa tissues and cell lines. The association of PSCA expression with the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) of PCa patients were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. The roles of PSCA in PCa were confirmed based on both in vitro and in vivo systems.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry results showed that PSCA was upregulated in PCa tissue. PSCA overexpression were significantly associated with high Gleason score (GS) (P = 0.028), positive BCR (P = 0.002), and poor OS (P = 0.032) and high c-Myc expression (P = 0.019). PSCA promoted PCa cell cycle progression and tumor growth via increased c-Myc expression. Additional, PI3K/AKT signaling pathways was involved in PSCA-mediated c-Myc expression and cell proliferation.

Development of nano-systems for simultaneous transfer of active substances and imaging of tumor regions gathers an important amount of scientific interest. This new category of nano-systems is called Theranostics. Theranostics methods can provide multiple benefits by inserting nanoparticles into the patient and using photodynamic therapy and pave the way for personalized medicine. The objective of this paper is to study the use and application of Theranostics in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, in order to achieve personalized anticancer treatment. For this purpose, investigation of existing literature has been conducted using electronic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. In addition, there was a secondary research phase, using paper citations found during the first research phase. It has to be pointed out that nanoparticles are the basis of Theranostics, since, due to their properties, they provide the ability to display accurate imaging and provide diagnosis along with simultaneous treatment of diseases. Theranostics methods may be applied in treatment of esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, in treatment of actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis and Bowen's disease and in treatment of basal cell epithelioma and macular degeneration. As a result, application of Theranostics can provide multiple benefits by inserting nanoparticles into the patient. This method is currently encountering many challenges, but continuation of research on the field is necessary not only for the improvement of the medical field and the healthcare techniques, but also for the creation of new treatment methods for patients with diseases that are incurable until now.""","""['Georgios Lymperopoulos', 'Panagiotis Lymperopoulos', 'Victoria Alikari', 'Chrisoula Dafogianni', 'Sofia Zyga', 'Nikoletta Margari']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Nuclear medicine diagnostics, therapy and theranostics in the context of modern oncology.', 'Advancements in Applications of Surface Modified Nanomaterials for Cancer Theranostics.', 'Gold nanoparticles enlighten the future of cancer theranostics.', 'Theranostics and metabolotheranostics for precision medicine in oncology.', 'Magnetic nanoparticles for precision oncology: theranostic magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for image-guided and targeted cancer therapy.', 'The Evolution of Targeted Radionuclide Diagnosis of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.', 'Nano-Theranostics for the Sensing, Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancers.', 'Supramolecular lipid nanoparticles as delivery carriers for non-invasive cancer theranostics.', 'Role of Complex Networks for Integrating Medical Images and Radiomic Features of Intracranial Ependymoma Patients in Response to Proton Radiotherapy.']"""

The core domain of Par-4 (aa 137-195), designated as SAC, is sufficient to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis without harming normal tissues and organs. Nevertheless, the anticancer effects of SAC have not been determined in ovarian cancer cells. Here, we developed a novel method for producing native SAC in Escherichia coli using a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion system. This fusion system not only greatly improved the solubility of target protein but also enhanced the expression level of SUMO-SAC. After purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, SUMO tag was cleaved from SUMO-SAC fusion protein using SUMO protease to obtain recombinant SAC. Furthermore, we simplified the purification process by combining the SUMO-SAC purification and SUMO tag cleavage into one step. Finally, the purity of recombinant SAC reached as high as 95% and the yield was 25 mg/L. Our results demonstrated that recombinant SAC strongly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3. Immunofluorescence analysis and competitive binding reaction showed that recombinant SAC could specifically induce apoptosis of SKOV-3 cells through combination with cell surface receptor, GRP78. Therefore, we have developed an effective strategy for expressing bioactive SAC in prokaryotic cells, which supports the application of SAC in ovarian cancer therapy.""","""['Jian Zhang', 'Aiyou Sun', 'Yuguo Dong', 'Dongzhi Wei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Appl Biochem Biotechnol""","""['Soluble expression, rapid purification, and characterization of human interleukin-24 (IL-24) using a MBP-SUMO dual fusion system in Escherichia coli.', 'SAC-TRAIL, a novel anticancer fusion protein: expression, purification, and functional characterization.', 'Expression and purification of an antitumor-analgesic peptide from the venom of Mesobuthus martensii Karsch by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in Escherichia coli.', 'SUMO fusion technology for enhanced protein expression and purification in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.', 'SUMO fusion technology for enhanced protein production in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems.', ""Prostate apoptosis response-4 and tumor suppression: it's not just about apoptosis anymore."", 'Generation of Native, Untagged Huntingtin Exon1 Monomer and Fibrils Using a SUMO Fusion Strategy.']"""

We therefore aim to evaluate the biochemical recurrence in men with positive surgical margins (PSM) after minimally-invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) in a UK tertiary centre.  Methods:   Retrospective study of men undergoing laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy between 2002 and 2014. Men with positive surgical margins (PSM) were identified and their biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate compared with men without PSM. The primary outcome measures were BCR rates and time to BCR. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for biochemical recurrence rate (BCR), accounting for potential confounders.  Results:   Five hundred ninety-two men were included for analysis. Pre-operative D'Amico risk stratification showed 37.5%, 53.3% and 9.3% of patients in the low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. On final pathological analysis, the proportion of patients with local staging pT2, pT3a and pT3b was 68.8%, 25.2% and 6.1% respectively. Overall positive margin rate was 30.6%. On multivariate analysis, the only pre-operative factor associated with PSM was age >65years. Patients with PSM were more likely to have higher tumour volume and more advanced pathological local stage. The BCR rate was 10.7% in margin-positive patients and 5.1% in margin-negative patients, at median 4.4-year follow-up. Upon multivariate analysis, high pre-operative PSA and high Gleason group were the only significant predictors of BCR (P<0.05).

Here, we studied the therapeutic effect of b-AP15 in PCa, and our results indicate that (i) b-AP15 decreases viability, proliferation and triggers cytotoxicity to both androgen receptor-dependent and -independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, associated with caspase activation, inhibition of mitochondria function, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; (ii) pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK and ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) efficiently block apoptosis but not proteasome inhibition induced by exposure of b-AP15; (iii) treatment with b-AP15 in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) cells down-regulates the expression of androgen receptor (AR), which is degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome system. Hence, the potent anti-tumor effect of b-AP15 on both androgen receptor-dependent and -independent PCa cells identifies a new promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Jianyu Cai#', 'Xiaohong Xia#', 'Yuning Liao#', 'Ningning Liu', 'Zhiqiang Guo', 'Jinghong Chen', 'Li Yang', 'Huidan Long', 'Qianqian Yang', 'Xiaolan Zhang', 'Lu Xiao', 'Xuejun Wang', 'Hongbiao Huang', 'Jinbao Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Targeted inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzymes, USP14 and UCHL5, induces proteotoxic stress and apoptosis in Waldenström macroglobulinaemia tumour cells.', 'Induction of tumor cell apoptosis by a proteasome deubiquitinase inhibitor is associated with oxidative stress.', 'Proteasomal cysteine deubiquitinase inhibitor b-AP15 suppresses migration and induces apoptosis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.', 'Proteasome deubiquitinases as novel targets for cancer therapy.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A review of deubiquitinases and thier roles in tumorigenesis and development.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'The UCHL5 inhibitor b-AP15 overcomes cisplatin resistance via suppression of cancer stemness in urothelial carcinoma.', 'Comprehensive Target Screening and Cellular Profiling of the Cancer-Active Compound b-AP15 Indicate Abrogation of Protein Homeostasis and Organelle Dysfunction as the Primary Mechanism of Action.', 'UCHL5 controls β-catenin destruction complex function through Axin1 regulation.']"""

Patients and Methods By using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we analyzed data from 14,715 patients with PCa diagnosed from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2011. The patients were treated with bilateral orchiectomy or GnRHa therapy. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting with propensity scores to adjust for the imbalance in covariate baseline values between these two groups. Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke (IS), and cardiac-related complications. Results Overall, 3,578 patients with PCa (24.3%) underwent bilateral orchiectomy and 11,137 patients (75.7%) received GnRHa therapy. Both groups had a similar risk of CV ischemic events (ie, MI or IS; hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.38) during a median follow-up time of 3.3 years. However, during the first 1.5 years of follow-up, there were higher CV ischemic events in the orchiectomy group than in the GnRHa group (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.88), particularly in patients who were ≥ 65 years of age, had hypertension, had a Charlson comorbidity index score ≥ 3, and had a previous history of MI, IS, or coronary heart disease. Conclusion Compared with bilateral orchiectomy, use of GnRHa does not increase the risk of CV ischemic events in patients with PCa. Nonetheless, orchiectomy is associated with higher rates of CV ischemic events in older patients and those with a history of CV comorbidities within 1.5 years of initiating androgen-deprivation therapy. These findings can help clinicians decide on the optimal castration strategy for individual patients.""","""['Dong-Yi Chen', 'Lai-Chu See', 'Jia-Rou Liu', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'See-Tong Pang', 'I-Chang Hsieh', 'Ming-Shien Wen', 'Tien-Hsing Chen', 'Yung-Chang Lin', 'Chuang-Chi Liaw', 'Cheng-Lung Hsu', 'John Wen-Cheng Chang', 'Chang-Fu Kuo', 'Wen-Kuan Huang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Comparison of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists and Orchiectomy: Effects of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events after surgical castration versus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists in Chinese men with prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy in treatment of prostate cancer and risk of myocardial infarction and stroke: a nationwide Danish population-based cohort study.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Cardiovascular risks of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cardiovascular Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy: from Basic Biology to Clinical Practice.', 'Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Potential Molecular Connections.', 'Incidence of stroke in the first year after diagnosis of cancer-A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Impacts of androgen deprivation therapy on the risks and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with prostate cancer.', 'What Is Your Choice for Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma: Surgical or Medical?']"""

However, the role of HP1γ in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We found that HP1γ is upregulated in PCa and elevated levels of HP1γ in PCa predict poor outcome. In addition, depletion of HP1γ in PCa cells not only repressed proliferation and induced apoptosis but also impaired tumorigenicity. We also found that c-Myc was capable of upregulating HP1γ by directly binding to the E-box element in the first intron of HP1γ gene, and the upregulated HP1γ, in turn, repressed the expression of miR-451a by enhancing H3K9 methylation at the promoter region of miR-451a. Furthermore, reduction of miR-451a significantly reversed HP1γ loss-induced PCa cell apoptosis, whereas miR-451a overexpression repressed cell survival by targeting and downregulating c-Myc. The association among c-Myc, HP1γ and miR-451a was further confirmed in human clinical samples.

TLR5 agonists, bacterial flagellin and engineered flagellin derivatives, have been shown to have potent antitumor and metastasis-suppressive effects in multiple animal models and to be safe in both animals and humans. Anticancer efficacy of TLR5 agonists stems from TLR5-dependent activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that mediates innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses. To extend application of TLR5-targeted anticancer immunotherapy to tumors that do not naturally express TLR5, we created an adenovirus-based vector for intratumor delivery, named Mobilan that drives expression of self-activating TLR5 signaling cassette comprising of human TLR5 and a secreted derivative of Salmonella flagellin structurally analogous to a clinical stage TLR5 agonist, entolimod. Co-expression of TLR5 receptor and agonist in Mobilan-infected cells established an autocrine/paracrine TLR5 signaling loop resulting in constitutive activation of NF-κB both in vitro and in vivo. Injection of Mobilan into primary tumors of the prostate cancer-prone transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice resulted in a strong induction of multiple genes involved in inflammatory responses and mobilization of innate immune cells into the tumors including neutrophils and NK cells and suppressed tumor progression. Intratumoral injection of Mobilan into subcutaneously growing syngeneic prostate tumors in immunocompetent hosts improved animal survival after surgical resection of the tumors, by suppression of tumor metastasis. In addition, vaccination of mice with irradiated Mobilan-transduced prostate tumor cells protected mice against subsequent tumor challenge. These results provide proof-of-concept for Mobilan as a tool for antitumor vaccination that directs TLR5-mediated immune response toward cancer cells and does not require identification of tumor antigens.""","""['V Mett', 'E A Komarova', 'K Greene', 'I Bespalov', 'C Brackett', 'B Gillard', 'A S Gleiberman', 'I A Toshkov', 'S Aygün-Sunar', 'C Johnson', 'E Karasik', 'M Bapardekar-Nair', 'O V Kurnasov', 'A L Osterman', 'P S Stanhope-Baker', 'C Morrison', 'M T Moser', 'B A Foster', 'A V Gudkov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['First-in-human study of anticancer immunotherapy drug candidate mobilan: safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in prostate cancer patients.', 'Central role of liver in anticancer and radioprotective activities of Toll-like receptor 5 agonist.', 'Flagellin enhances tumor-specific CD8⁺ T cell immune responses through TLR5 stimulation in a therapeutic cancer vaccine model.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'AsialoGM1 and TLR5 cooperate in flagellin-induced nucleotide signaling to activate Erk1/2.', 'Toll-like receptor-targeted anti-tumor therapies: Advances and challenges.', 'Immunotherapeutic Implications of Toll-like Receptors Activation in Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Therapeutic applications of toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonists in AML.', 'Exploiting viral sensing mediated by Toll-like receptors to design innovative vaccines.', 'Toll-Like Receptor-Based Strategies for Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

Limits in PCa research come from the lack of in vitro and in vivo models that mimic the human disease. Currently, 2D in vitro tissue culture models of PCa are widely used but they present numerous limits. They do not reproduce cellular morphology, tissue architecture, inter-patients and intratumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, they lack two key components of PCa tumors, the tumoral microenvironment and the cancer stem cells. In vivo murine models of PCa cannot be representative of all the genetic alterations known in prostate tumors and they hardly reproduce the pathophysiology of human metastatic progression. Consequently, the physiology of these in vitro and in vivo models do not well represent patients tumors. 3D cell cultures overcome many of these limits by sharing morphologic characteristics with in vivo tumors as well as reproducibility of in vitro models. 3D models of PCa include spheroids derived from tumor cell lines, and organoids, derived from patient. In 3D cell cultures, cell fitness is maintained, the physiological cells-cells and cell-matrix interactions are restored and an extracellular matrix surrounds the cells. Organoids, generated from PCa primary tumors or metastases, allow studies on cancer stem cells and their microenvironment. Moreover, organoids retain genetic integrity of PCa tumors. PCa organoid model is an innovative tool that offers great perspectives of therapeutic screening.

Methods:   Monitoring data was analysed for 526 fractions from 20 localised prostate cancer patients. Intrafraction prostate displacements exceeding thresholds of 3 mm, 7 mm and 10 mm along patient axes were assessed for frequency and duration of motion.  Results:   Prostate motion exceeds the above displacement thresholds during 52%, 8%, and 2% of fractions analysed. Displacement at the 3 mm threshold occurred for 100% of patients, 60% at 7 mm and 35% at 10 mm. The mean frequency and duration of displacements is low for the overall population. In contrast specific patients exhibit much higher displacement values. Posterior motion is most common, averaging at 24% of the treatment time at 3 mm, 3% at 7 mm and 1% at 10 mm, ranging up to 92%, 35% and 10% for individual patients.  Conclusions:   Intrafraction monitoring with Clarity has the potential to improve accuracy through application of in-treatment motion correction. This is most beneficial for specific patients who exhibit a higher frequency and/or duration of prostate motion. Consideration must be given to the added time implications and radiographer workload in clinical practice to correct for prostate motion.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed incidence rates and prostate specific antigen screening prevalence by age, race/ethnicity, disease stage, United States region and area level socioeconomic status. Annual percent changes were examined for changes in rates with time. The predicted marginal probability and 95% CIs were calculated to estimate changes in prostate specific antigen screening.  Results:   Incidence rates in men 50 years old or older decreased in all race/ethnic, regional and socioeconomic status groups. From 2007 to 2013 the overall incidence rates for localized cancer significantly decreased 7.5% per year (95% CI -10.5--4.4) at ages 50 to 74 years and 11.1% per year (95% CI -14.1--8.1) at ages 75 years or greater. In contrast, the incidence of distant stage cancer significantly increased 1.4% per year (95% CI 0.3-2.5) from 2008 to 2013 at ages 50 to 74 years but stabilized from 2011 to 2013 at ages 75 years or greater at 5.1% per year (95% CI -3.4-14.4). Distant stage disease rates increased with increasing poverty level at ages 50 to 74 years but not at 75 years or greater.  Conclusions:   The prostate cancer incidence of early stage disease decreased in men 50 years old or older while the rate of distant stage disease slightly increased in men 50 to 74 years old following USPSTF recommendations against routine prostate specific antigen screening.

The device was calibrated using an indentation stiffness measurement rig and gelatine samples with a range of static modulus similar to that reported in the literature for prostate tissue. The glands were removed from patients with diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy, and the stiffness was measured within 30 min of surgical removal. Each prostate was later examined histologically in a column immediately below each indentation point and graded into one of the four groups; normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cancerous and mixed cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In total, 11 prostates were assessed using multiple point probing, and the complex modulus at 1 and 5 Hz was calculated on a point-by-point basis. The device yielded values of quasi-static modulus of 15 ± 0.5 kPa and dynamic modulus of 20 ± 0.5 kPa for whole prostates, and a sensitivity of up to 80% with slightly lower specificity was achieved on diagnosis of prostate cancer using a combination of mechanical measures. This assessment did not take into account some obvious factors such as edge effects, overlap and clinical significance of the cancer, all of which would improve performance.

The technique is applied, in vitro, to samples of excised prostate gland affected by benign prostate hyperplasia and/or prostate cancer. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between the histological structure of the tissue and the dynamic mechanical properties in an attempt to separate patient-specific aspects from histopathological condition (i.e. prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia). The technique is of clinical interest because it is potentially deployable in vivo. Prostate samples were obtained from a total of 36 patients who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate to relieve prostatic obstruction and 4 patients who had undergone radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. Specimens (chips) recovered from transurethral resection of the prostate were of nominal size 5 mm × 8 mm and thicknesses between 2 and 4 mm, whereas those from the cystoprostatectomy were in the form of transverse slices of thickness approximately 6 mm. Specimens were mechanically tested by a controlled strain cyclic compression technique, and the resulting dynamic mechanical properties expressed as the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the cyclic stress and cyclic strain. After mechanical testing, the percentage areas of glandular and smooth muscle were measured at each probe point. Good contrast between the dynamic modulus of chips from benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients was demonstrated, and absolute values similar to those published by other authors are reported. For the slices, modulus values were considerably higher than for chips, and good in-patient mechanical contrast was revealed for predominantly nodular and predominantly stromal areas. Extending this classification between patients required pattern recognition techniques. Overall, the study has demonstrated that dynamic mechanical properties can potentially be used for diagnosis of prostate condition using in vivo measurements.""","""['Th Jimmy Yang', 'Simon Phipps', 'Steve Kw Leung', 'Robert L Reuben', 'Fouad K Habib', 'S Alan McNeill']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Proc Inst Mech Eng H""","""['Quantitative mechanical assessment of the whole prostate gland ex vivo using dynamic instrumented palpation.', 'Mechanical mapping of the prostate in vivo using Dynamic Instrumented Palpation; towards an in vivo strategy for cancer assessment.', 'Measurement of the mechanical characteristics of benign prostatic tissue: a novel method for assessing benign prostatic disease.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Diagnostic assessment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

It is associated with excellent surgical, functional and oncological results with less postoperative pain and shorter convalescence. Anyway, the development of an incisional hernia (IH), may negate known benefits as it can lead not only to bothersome symptoms but also to severe complications, such as bowel obstruction, strangulation and perforation. Port-site or extraction site hernias, whose incidence rate is underdiagnosed, have become more commonly after minimally invasive surgery; but IH rate after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy has not been well characterized. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of extraction-site location (vertical supra-umbilical incision versus an off-midline incision) on incisional hernia rates in robotic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We included in the study 800 patients undergone RALP, 400 with a supra-umbilical incision for specimen extraction and 400 with off-midline incision. All were followed up for at least 3 years. The main study end point was IH occurrence at the extraction site (midline versus off-midline).  Results:   IH rate for the entire series was 4.75%, in particular 5% for the midline group and 4.5% for the off-midline group. The hernias were diagnosed at a mean of 20.2 and 18.2 months after surgery, respectively in the two groups. There was no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics; anyway larger prostate weight, wound infection and history of prior cholecystectomy were associated with higher proportion of IH.  Conclusion:   Extraction site hernias are a rare but a potentially serious complication following RALP. In our series, the midline extraction doesn't result in a significantly higher IH rate in comparison with the off-midline extraction site.""","""['M Seveso', 'S Melegari', 'G Bozzini', 'O De Francesco', 'A Mandressi', 'G Taverna']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Surg""","""['The prevention of extraction site incisional hernia after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Are we failing to consent to an increasingly common complication?

Methods and materials:   We present the results of a national cohort study using administrative hospital data for all 44,363 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent radical radiation therapy in the English National Health Service between 2010 and 2014. Using geographic information systems, we investigated the extent to which men choose to travel beyond (""bypass"") their nearest radiation therapy center, and we used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effect of hospital and patient characteristics on this mobility.  Results:   In all, 20.7% of men (n=9161) bypassed their nearest radiation therapy center. Travel time had a very strong impact on where patients moved to for their treatment, but its effect was smaller for men who were younger, more affluent, and from rural areas (P for interaction always <.001). Men were prepared to travel further to hospitals that offered hypofractionated prostate radiation therapy as their standard schedule (odds ratio 3.19, P<.001), to large-scale radiation therapy units (odds ratio 1.56, P<.001), and to hospitals that were early adopters of intensity modulated radiation therapy (odds ratio 1.37, P<.001).  Conclusions:   Men with prostate cancer are prepared to bypass their nearest radiation therapy centers. They are more likely to travel to larger established centers and those that offer innovative technology and more convenient radiation therapy schedules. Indicators that accurately reflect the quality of radiation therapy delivered are needed to guide patients' choices for radiation therapy treatment. In their absence, patient mobility may negatively affect the efficiency and capacity of a regional or national radiation therapy service and offer perverse incentives for technology adoption.""","""['Ajay Aggarwal', 'Daniel Lewis', 'Arunan Sujenthiran', 'Susan C Charman', 'Richard Sullivan', 'Heather Payne', 'Malcolm Mason', 'Jan van der Meulen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Determinants of Patient Mobility for Prostate Cancer Surgery: A Population-based Study of Choice and Competition.', 'Association Between Travel Distance and Choice of Treatment for Prostate Cancer: Does Geography Reduce Patient Choice?', 'Simulating the impact of centralization of prostate cancer surgery services on travel burden and equity in the English National Health Service: A national population based model for health service re-design.', 'Elective Pelvic Nodal Irradiation With a Simultaneous Hypofractionated Integrated Prostate Boost for Localised Prostate Cancer: Ready for Prime Time?', 'Evolution of definitive external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', ""Managing the cancer backlog: a national population-based study of patient mobility, waiting times and 'spare capacity' for cancer surgery."", 'Travel patterns of patients seeking cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Multi-centre cohort study in Osaka, Japan.', 'Impact of patient choice and hospital competition on patient outcomes after rectal cancer surgery: A national population-based study.', '""Shopping around"" for treatment is not a solution to cancer backlog.', 'Value of Geographical Information Systems in Analyzing Geographic Accessibility to Inform Radiotherapy Planning: A Systematic Review.']"""

Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 were treated with fasudil at the concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μmol/L, respectively, and those as negative controls cultured in the Ham's-F12 medium, all for 24 hours. Then, MTT assay was used to measure the cell inhibition rate and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of fasudil, with 1/4 of IC50 as the medication dose for further investigation. The expressions of RhoA, RockⅠ, and RockⅡ proteins in the PC3 and DU145 cells were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and the invasion, migration and apoptosis of the cells were determined using the Transwell chamber, scratch wound healing assay and flow cytometry.  Results:   Fasudil inhibited the proliferation of the PC3 cells from (9.29±1.23)% at 5 μmol/L to (81.37±3.97)% at 160 μmol/L and that of DU145 from (7.59±1.54)% to (76.53±2.67)%, both in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05 ).

Using two human prostate cancer cell lines we examined the expression of Set8, a histone methyltransferase, and Sirt1, a histone deacetylase, after exposure to estrogen or BPA. These experiments were carried out in the presence of natural hormones to understand the impact of additional exposure to estrogen or BPA on HME expression. We found differential expression of the HMEs in the different models and between the different compounds. Further, we determined that the changes in gene expression occurred via estrogen receptor signaling using the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780 (fulvestrant). Interestingly we found that the combination of ICI with estrogen or BPA greatly affected the expression of Set8, even when the hormone alone had no effect.

MTT assay was employed to determine the viability of cells in two-dimensional (2D) cultures. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by PI staining, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expressions of apoptosis-related genes at mRNA level. Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase proteins. Cytotoxicity assay and morphological observation of PC3 cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures were used to determine the effect of combination treatment. Results showed that doxycycline combined with doxorubicin significantly inhibited PC3 cells in both 2D and 3D cultures, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. RT-PCR showed down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax mRNA after combination treatment. Meanwhile, western blot analysis showed that combination treatment resulted in down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation of Bax protein, and that PARP cleavage was obviously exhibited after combination treatment. Confocal imaging analysis indicated that doxorubicin penetrated deeply into the core of spheroids when combined with doxycycline.

In addition to comparing histology, immunohistochemistry, and general measures of DNA and RNA integrity in each fixation method, we performed functional tests of DNA and RNA quality, including targeted Miseq RNA and DNA sequencing, and implemented methods to relate DNA and RNA yield and quality to quantified DNA and RNA picogram nuclear content in each tissue volume studied. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use PFPE tissue for routine robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy surgical pathology diagnostics and immunohistochemistry, with the benefit of significantly improvedDNA and RNA quality and RNA picogram yield per nucleus as compared with FFPE tissue. For fresh frozen, FFPE, and PFPE tissues, respectively, the average Genomic Quality Numbers were 7.9, 3.2, and 6.2, average RNA Quality Numbers were 8.7, 2.6, and 6.3, average DNA picogram yields per nucleus were 0.41, 0.69, and 0.78, and average RNA picogram yields per nucleus were 1.40, 0.94, and 2.24. These findings suggest that where DNA and/or RNA analysis of tissue is required, and when tissue size is small, PFPE may provide important advantages over FFPE.

In the case of severe axial loading impairment, anterior column reconstruction is indicated. The authors describe the use of interbody distraction to restore vertebral body height and correct kyphotic angulation prior to reconstruction with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and report the long-term durability of such reconstruction. METHODS A single institution, prospective series of patients with ESCC undergoing single-stage decompression, anterior column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation from 2013 to 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Several demographic, perioperative, and radiographic measurements were collected. Descriptive statistics were compiled, in addition to postoperative changes in anterior height, posterior height, and kyphosis. Paired Student t-tests were performed for each variable. Overall survival was calculated using the techniques described by Kaplan and Meier. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent single-stage posterior decompression with interbody distraction and anterior column reconstruction using PMMA. The median age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score were 61 years and 70, respectively. Primary tumors included renal cell (n = 8), lung (n = 4), multiple myeloma (n = 2), prostate (n = 2), and other (n = 5). Eighteen patients underwent a single-level vertebral body reconstruction and 3 underwent multilevel transpedicular corpectomies. The median survival duration was 13.3 months. In the immediate postoperative setting, statistically significant improvement was noted in anterior body height (p = 0.0017, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.15 to -1.11) and posterior body height (p = 0.0116, 95% CI -3.14 to -0.45) in all patients, and improved kyphosis was observed in those with oblique endplates (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 11.16-20.27). In the median follow-up duration of 13.9 months, the authors observed 3 cases of asymptomatic PMMA subsidence. One patient required reoperation in the form of extension of fusion. CONCLUSIONS In situ interbody distraction allows safe and durable reconstruction with PMMA, restores vertebral height, and corrects kyphotic deformities associated with severe pathological fractures caused by tumor. This is accomplished with minimal manipulation of the thecal sac and avoiding an extensive 360° surgical approach in patients who cannot tolerate extensive surgery.""","""['Scott L Zuckerman', 'Ganesh Rao', 'Laurence D Rhines', 'Ian E McCutcheon', 'Richard G Everson', 'Claudio E Tatsui']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Neurosurg Spine""","""['Change in the cross-sectional area of the thecal sac following balloon kyphoplasty for pathological vertebral compression fractures prior to spine stereotactic radiosurgery.', 'Complete percutaneous treatment of vertebral body tumors causing spinal canal compromise using a transpedicular cavitation, cement augmentation, and radiosurgical technique.', 'Direct reduction of thoracolumbar burst fractures by means of balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate and stabilization with pedicle-screw instrumentation and fusion.', 'Posterior Nerve-Sparing Multilevel Cervical Corpectomy and Reconstruction for Metastatic Cervical Spine Tumors: Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Compressive myelopathy and compression fracture of aggressive vertebral hemangioma after parturition: A case report and review of literature.', 'Essential Concepts for the Management of Metastatic Spine Disease: What the Surgeon Should Know and Practice.', 'Hybrid Therapy for Metastatic Epidural Spinal Cord Compression: Technique for Separation Surgery and Spine Radiosurgery.', 'Minimally invasive surgery for thoracolumbar spinal trauma.']"""

We aimed to evaluate especially the process of extrinsic apoptosis in the spectrum of neoplastic lesions of the prostate epithelium so as to reveal the variations in the apoptotic process.  Material and method:   The study included 20 benign prostatic hyperplasia, 8 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 82 prostatic carcinoma patients. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections obtained from materials of suprapubic prostatectomy, tru-cut biopsy, transurethral resection and radical prostatectomy. While Fas and FasL were evaluated in glandular and stromal areas, DcR1 and FLIP were evaluated in only glandular areas. Intensity and extent of immunostaining for Fas and FasL antibodies were separately scored and both scores were summarized. The total score of ≥ 4 both for Fas and FasL, expressions of FLIP and DcR1determined in more than 5% of glandular areas were accepted as positive.  Results:   Glandular FasL positivity was observed in 63.8 and 20% of the cases with prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia, respectively (p=0.001). The loss of stromal Fas expression in PCa was obvious (p < 0.001). FLIP positivity was more frequently seen in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa.  Conclusion:   In prostatic carcinoma, decreased stromal Fas expression, contrary to higher glandular FasL positivity, supports the assertion that sensitivity of epithelial and stromal cells to apoptosis and their protective pathways against apoptosis undergo alterations. Increased FLIP expressions in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic carcinoma can also be interpreted accordingly.""","""['Ayşe Burcu Ileri', 'Reşit Doğan Köseoğlu', 'Fatma Markoç', 'İlker Etikan', 'Doğan Atilgan', 'Faik Alev Deresoy']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Turk Patoloji Derg""","""['Fas and Fas ligand expression is elevated in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Androgen receptor expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.', 'Production of serum-free and total prostate-specific antigen due to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Apoptotic regulators in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN): value in prostate cancer detection and prevention.', 'Pseudohyperplastic prostate carcinoma: histologic patterns and differential diagnosis.']"""

Consequently, it is feasible to inform personalized drug treatment decisions using personal genomics data. However, these efforts are limited due to a lack of reliable computational approaches for predicting effective drugs for individual patients. The reverse gene set enrichment analysis (i.e., connectivity mapping) approach and its variants have been widely and successfully used for drug prediction. However, the performance of these methods is limited by undefined mechanism of action (MoA) of drugs and reliance on cohorts of patients rather than personalized predictions for individual patients.  Results:   In this study, we have developed and evaluated a computational approach, known as Mechanism and Drug Miner (MD-Miner), using a network-based computational approach to predict effective drugs and reveal potential drug mechanisms of action at the level of signaling pathways. Specifically, the patient-specific signaling network is constructed by integrating known disease associated genes with patient-derived gene expression profiles. In parallel, a drug mechanism of action network is constructed by integrating drug targets and z-score profiles of drug-induced gene expression (pre vs. post-drug treatment). Potentially effective candidate drugs are prioritized according to the number of common genes between the patient-specific dysfunctional signaling network and drug MoA network. We evaluated the MD-Miner method on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, and showed that it significantly improved the success rate of discovering effective drugs compared with the random selection, and could provide insight into potential mechanisms of action.  Conclusions:   This work provides a signaling network-based drug repositioning approach. Compared with the reverse gene signature based drug repositioning approaches, the proposed method can provide clues of mechanism of action in terms of signaling transduction networks.""","""['Haoyang Wu', 'Elise Miller', 'Denethi Wijegunawardana', 'Kelly Regan', 'Philip R O Payne', 'Fuhai Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['A novel individualized drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for type 1 diabetes mellitus.', 'Inferring new indications for approved drugs via random walk on drug-disease heterogenous networks.', 'Computational Drug Repositioning with Random Walk on a Heterogeneous Network.', 'Drug repositioning in SLE: crowd-sourcing, literature-mining and Big Data analysis.', 'Computational drug repositioning for rare diseases in the era of precision medicine.', 'Evaluating the performance of drug-repurposing technologies.', 'Reconciling multiple connectivity scores for drug repurposing.', 'Computational analysis to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 based on transcriptional response of host cells to SARS-CoV-2.', 'Transcriptomics-Based Drug Repurposing Approach Identifies Novel Drugs against Sorafenib-Resistant Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Integrative network analysis identifies potential targets and drugs for ovarian cancer.']"""

Our aims were to identify sites of prostate cancer LR in biochemical recurrence post-prostatectomy using 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and to compare different CTV-delineation guidelines in a cohort of postoperative patients.  Material and methods:   Thirty-six patients presenting with LR within the prostatic bed on 18F-FCH PET/CT between 10/2011 and 06/2016 were included in this retrospective study. Median PSA at the time of 18F-FCH PET/CT was 2.7 ng/mL (0.8-9.4) and median PSA doubling time was 11 months (3-28). For each patient, the CTVRTOG, CTVFROGG and CTVEORTC following the corresponding guidelines were outlined and compared. Forty-one LR were delineated using a gradient-based method and the percentage of FCH uptake included in each CTV was evaluated.  Results:   The anastomosis was the most common recurrence site (52.8%), followed by the retrovesical region (31.7%) and the bladder neck (7%). The median SUV max value was 4.8 (2.3-16.1). The percentage of LR entirely included in the CTVRTOG was not significantly different from that included in the CTVFROGG (84% versus 83%, p = .5). Significantly more recurrences were included in the CTVRTOG volume compared to the CTVEORTC (84% versus 68%, p=.006), due to a better coverage of the bladder neck and retrovesical regions. Six out of 10 relapses occurring in the posterior region of the anastomosis were not covered by any of the CTVs.  Conclusions:   In our study, the CTVRTOG and CTVFROGG ensured the best coverage of LR seen on 18F-FCH PET/CT. When outlining the prostatic fossa, greater coverage of the posterior vesico-urethral region may allow better coverage of potential microscopic disease.""","""['Osman El Kabbaj', 'Philippe Robin', 'David Bourhis', 'Gurvan Dissaux', 'Nicola Rosenfelder', 'Antoine Valeri', 'Georges Fournier', 'Pierre-Yves Salaun', 'Olivier Pradier', 'Jean-Pierre Malhaire', 'Ronan Abgral', 'Ulrike Schick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Pattern of occult nodal relapse diagnosed with (18)F-fluoro-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after prostate-only radiotherapy.', 'Single center experience of (18F)-fluorocholine positron emission tomography: analysis of its impact on salvage local therapy in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Evaluation of tumor recurrences after radical prostatectomy using 18F-Choline PET/CT and 3T multiparametric MRI without endorectal coil: a single center experience.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using 18F-Choline PET/Computed Tomography.', 'A Phase 1 Trial of Highly Conformal, Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy.', 'Post-Operative Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: Is It Time for a Belt and Braces Approach?', 'PET/CT-Based Salvage Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Impact on Treatment Management and Future Directions.']"""

Displacement of the anterior rectal region larger than 5 mm, requiring repeated precaution, was defined as the level of rectal displacement requiring action (ARD).  Results:   ARD was identified in 815 (7.7%) out of 9,345 fractions and at least once in 82% (216/264) of patients. The highest incidence of ARD (11%) was found during the initial week of treatment (first five and next five fractions), after which the incidence decreased to 6% (p<0.0001). Patients with lean body (lower body mass index (BMI) tended to have a higher incidence of ARD. We identified 16 (6%) cases of gastrointestinal toxicity and 12 (4.5%) genitourinary toxicities as a late adverse reaction (3 months or later after IG-IMRT). There was no correlation between ARD and late toxicity. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control was also similar (p=0.12) between those with ARD (96% at 5 year) and those without ARD (88%).

Men diagnosed with low-risk PCa may be eligible for active surveillance (AS) to monitor their cancer to ensure that any changes are discovered and responded to in a timely way. Communication of risk in this context is more complicated than determining a numerical probability of risk, as patients wish to understand the implications of risk on their lives in concrete terms. Our study will examine how risk for PCa is perceived, experienced and communicated by patients using AS with their health professionals, and the implications for treatment and care.  Methods and analysis:   This is a proof of concept study, testing out a multimethod, qualitative approach to data collection in the context of PCa for the first time in Australia. It is being conducted from November 2016 to December 2017 in an Australian university hospital urology clinic. Participants are 10 men with a diagnosis of localised PCa, who are using an AS protocol, and 5 health professionals who work with this patient group (eg, urologists and Pca nurses). Data will be collected using observations of patient consultations with health professionals, patient questionnaires and interviews, and interviews with healthcare professionals. Analysis will be conducted in two stages. First, observational data from consultations will be analysed thematically to encapsulate various dimensions of risk classification and consultation dialogue. Second, interview data will be coded to derive meaning in text and analysed thematically. Overarching themes will represent patient and health professional perspectives of risk communication.

This model of care delivery may be a viable alternative to inpatient admission for patients with cancer presenting with certain conditions. Our objective was to assess the use of observation status among Medicare beneficiaries with and without cancer. Methods: Population-based SEER-Medicare data were used to assess differences in the use of observation status between Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years with and without cancer using a matched analysis (n=151,183 per cohort). We assessed the ratio of observation unit use to inpatient admission, between cancer and noncancer cohorts, and for patients diagnosed with breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers. Poisson regression models were used to calculate observation rate estimates and 95% CIs while adjusting for selected patient characteristics. Results: When considering the volume of hospitalizations, observation status is used less frequently among beneficiaries with cancer than those without (43 vs 69 observation status visits per 1,000 inpatient admissions, respectively). The estimated observation rate per 1,000 inpatient admissions was higher for beneficiaries aged <75 years versus those aged ≥75 years, those with a Charlson comorbidity index of 0 vs 1 or ≥2, and those without a prior hospitalization versus those with ≥1 prior hospitalizations. Patients with breast and prostate cancers had higher adjusted and unadjusted observation rates per 1,000 inpatient admissions compared with those with colon and lung cancers.

Methods:   Three 8-mm robotic ports and two 12-mm laparoscopic ports are placed in a ""W"" configuration, approximately 2-3 cm more cephalad than for radical prostatectomy (Fig. 1). The robot is docked between the legs with the patient in steep Trendelenburg. The ureters are dissected out from the iliac vessels to the rectovesical pouch, where they are clipped and transected. The sigmoid colon is stapled across at the rectosigmoid junction and reflected into the abdomen. A posterior plane is developed below the rectum (Fig. 2A), if space allows, or through the rectum. The endopelvic fascia is exposed and incised bilaterally. After sequentially controlling the bladder and prostatic pedicles (Fig. 2B) using the Harmonic scalpel, the urethra is transected at the prostatic apex, and the anterior rectal wall is incised (Fig. 2C). Any remaining attachments are divided, the rectal remnant is excised, and the specimen is bagged and extracted (Fig. 2D). Adjacent segments of left and sigmoid colon are harvested for the conduit and colostomy, avoiding a bowel anastomosis. The ureters are anastomosed to the conduit, maintaining separation between the gastrointestinal and the urinary systems. The conduit and left end colostomy are matured (Fig. 3). The technique is performed entirely intracorporeally with specimen extraction through the anus, avoiding a large open incision.  Results:   We present the case of a high-functioning (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1) 73-year-old man with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer following failed primary brachytherapy. Despite a good systemic response to chemotherapy and complete androgen blockade, his prostate-specific antigen level continued to rise (to 33 ng/mL) because of an enlarging prostatic pelvic mass. He suffered from progressive local symptoms, including intractable pelvic pain, obstructive uropathy, and impending rectal obstruction. The indication for pelvic exenteration was local palliation. Total robotic time was 5.4 hours. The perioperative course was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to metastatic prostate cancer, which resulted in a transient ischemic attack. The disseminated intravascular coagulation resolved with blood product transfusion, and the patient recovered well without permanent disability. In-patient length of stay was 8 days. Complete local palliation was achieved until the patient's death from prostate cancer 5 months later.

Interactions between prostate cancer cells and the bone microenvironment facilitate survival of tumor cells and alter bone turnover, a process that is thought to enhance the growth of metastases in this site. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the presence of tumors cells increases transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in bone and that this regulates the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic lineage cells in metastatic sites. Initial studies showed that factors produced by prostate cancer cells increased the proliferation of osteoblastic cells and suppressed the early phase of their differentiation. We subsequently showed that interactions between prostate cancer and osteoblastic cells affected the expression of TGF-β superfamily genes in the latter. Noggin was expressed and secreted by prostate cancer cells but expressed at very low levels by osteoblastic cells when these cells were grown alone. This pattern changed when osteoblasic cells were treated with conditioned medium derived from prostate cancer cells or were cocultured with the latter, with strong induction of Noggin being demonstrated. Immunohistochemical examination of prostate cancer xenografts showed strong Noggin protein staining on endosteal bone surfaces and in bone lining cells in close proximity to tumor foci. These studies support previous work that suggest Noggin is an important suppressor of the differentiation of osteoblast lineage cells in bone metastases.

Methods:   The K-CaP registry consisted of 6415 patients who underwent RP from May 2001 to April 2013 at five institutions.

This study evaluated differences in the expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), a known family of oncoproteins, in blood-derived exosomal vesicles (EV) between African-American and European-American men with prostate cancer. The ExoQuick™ method was used to isolate EV from both plasma and sera of African-American (n = 41) and European-American (n = 31) men with prostate cancer, as well as from controls with no cancer diagnosis (n = 10). EV preparations were quantified by acetylcholinesterase activity assays, and assessed for their IAP content by Western blotting and densitometric analysis. Circulating levels of the IAP Survivin were evaluated by ELISA. We detected a significant increase in the levels of circulating Survivin in prostate cancer patients compared to controls (P<0.01), with the highest levels in African-American patients (P<0.01). African-American patients with prostate cancer also contained significantly higher amounts of EVs in their plasma (P<0.01) and sera (P<0.05) than European-American patients. In addition, EVs from African-American patients with prostate cancer contained significantly higher amounts of the IAPs Survivin (P<0.05), XIAP (P<0.001), and cIAP-2 (P<0.01) than EVs from European-American patients. There was no significant correlation between expression of IAPs and clinicopathological parameters in the two patient groups. Increased expression of IAPs in EVs from African-American patients with prostate cancer may influence tumor aggressiveness and contribute to the mortality disparity observed in this patient population.

Diagnostic PSA serum levels, Gleason score, tumor stage, D´Amico risk and data of clinical progression were obtained for patients at the moment of the diagnosis and after 54 months of follow-up. Chi-squared test were used for comparisons between clinical variables groups, logistic regression for clinical variables associations between SNPs; and Kaplan-Meier for the association between SNPs and time to biochemical progression. We found 5 variants (CYP17A1) rs743572, rs6162, rs6163; (LHCGR) rs2293275 and (ESR2) rs1256049 that were statistically significant according to clinical variables (PSA, D´Amico risk and T stage) on a case-case analysis. Moreover, the presence of A and G alleles in rs743572 and rs6162 respectively, increase the risk of higher PSA levels (>10 ng/μl). With respect to D´Amico risk rs743572 (AG-GG), rs6162 (AG-AA) and rs6163 (AC-AA) were associated with an increased risk; and last, AC and AA genotypes for rs6163 were associated with a shorter biochemical recurrence free survival (BRFS) in patients with radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   Forty-seven consecutive patients with 52 PZ Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 cancers that were 0.5 cm3 or larger underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and 3-T MRI between 2012 and 2015. Two blinded radiologists (readers 1 and 2) retrospectively assigned PI-RADSv1 sequence (T2-weighted imaging, DWI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [DCE-MRI]) and sum scores and PI-RADSv2 assessment categories. A third blinded radiologist (reader 3) measured apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio (ADC of tumor / ADC of normal PZ) using RP-MRI maps. Sensitivity, false-positive rate, and overall accuracy were compared using McNemar test. Pearson correlation was performed.

As with the first-line therapeutic bicalutamide (Casodex), resistance to newer antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509) develops quickly in patients, despite the fact that these drugs have ∼10-fold better affinity for the androgen receptor than bicalutamide. Improving affinity alone is often not sufficient to prevent resistance, and alternative strategies are needed to improve antiandrogen efficacy. Covalent and reversible covalent drugs are being used to thwart drug resistance in other contexts, and activated aryl nitriles are among the moieties being exploited for this purpose. We capitalized on the presence of an aryl nitrile in bicalutamide, and the existence of a native cysteine residue (Cys784) in the androgen receptor ligand binding pocket, to develop 5N-bicalutamide, a cysteine-reactive antiandrogen. 5N-bicalutamide exhibits a 150-fold improvement in Ki and 20-fold improvement in IC50 over the parent compound. We attribute the marked improvement in affinity and activity to the formation of a covalent adduct with Cys784, a residue that is not among the more than 160 androgen receptor point mutations associated with prostate cancer. Increasing the residence time of bound antiandrogen via formation of a covalent adduct may forestall the drug resistance seen with current clinical antiandrogens.""","""['Felipe de Jesus Cortez', 'Phuong Nguyen', 'Charles Truillet', 'Boxue Tian', 'Kristopher M Kuchenbecker', 'Michael J Evans', 'Paul Webb', 'Matthew P Jacobson', 'Robert J Fletterick', 'Pamela M England']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Chemical Degradation of Androgen Receptor (AR) Using Bicalutamide Analog-Thalidomide PROTACs.', 'Synthesis and preliminary investigations into novel 1,2,3-triazole-derived androgen receptor antagonists inspired by bicalutamide.', 'Interaction mechanism exploration of R-bicalutamide/S-1 with WT/W741L AR using molecular dynamics simulations.', 'Developments in nonsteroidal antiandrogens targeting the androgen receptor.', 'Steroidal and nonsteroidal antiandrogens: chemical structures, mechanisms of action and clinical applications.', 'Covalent Warheads Targeting Cysteine Residue: The Promising Approach in Drug Development.', 'Pyrazol-1-yl-propanamides as SARD and Pan-Antagonists for the Treatment of Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our previous studies demonstrated that L-plastin is involved in PCa invasion and metastasis and is upregulated by androgen and oestrogen in the hormone-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP. We recently found that L-plastin expression is consistently activated even after androgen deprivation, suggesting that androgen-independent transcription factors may regulate its expression. Herein, we performed sequential deletion and luciferase analysis of the L-plastin promoter and found that an androgen-independent regulatory factor prominently located in the region close to the transcription initiation site (-216 to +118) may facilitate L-plastin upregulation. AP4 was then identified as the relevant transcription activator that directly binds to the L-plastin promoter, as confirmed by EMSAs, supershift assays and CHIP-qPCR experiments. Moreover, we determined that the AP4/L-plastin axis is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, contributing to PCa metastasis and castration resistance. Furthermore, we found that AP4 promotes PCa metastasis by upregulating L-plastin expression in vitro and in vivo. We collected a total of 136 PCa tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues from patients who underwent prostatectomy at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital from 2005 to 2015 and measured AP4 and L-plastin protein levels by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that AP4 levels strongly correlated with those of its downstream target gene L-plastin, were significantly upregulated in PCa tissues, were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and Gleason scores over 7, and were an independent prognostic factor for patient survival.

In this work, we characterized the expression, biomarker-potential and functional regulation of miR-588 in PCa.  Methods:   Endogenous miR-588 levels were quantified by qRT-PCR in both prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-negative and PSA-positive PCa cell lines, as well as human PCa tumors. The associations between endogenous miR-588 and PCa patients' clinical outcomes and postoperative overall survival were statistically examined. Moreover, in both PSA-negative DU145 and PSA-positive LNCaP, downregulation of miR-588 was achived by transduction of miR-588 inhibitor lentivirus. The subsequent effects of miR-588 downregulation on PCa cell developments were investigated both in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   MiR-588 was profoundly upregulated in both PSA-negative and PSA-positive PCa cells, as well as in PCa tumors. Significant miR-588 upregulation was found to be closely associated with PCa patients' poor clinical outcomes and shorter postoperative overall survivals. In DU145 and LNCaP cell lines, lentiviral transduction markedly downregulated endogenous miR-588 levels. MiR-588 downregulation was shown to profoundly inhibit PCa proliferation in vitro and xenograft in vivo.  Conclusion:   Aberrant upregulation of endogenous miR-588 in PCa patients may be a prognostic biomarker, indicative of their poor clinical outcomes. Inhibiting endogenous miR-588 may also serve as a therapeutic target for PCa treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

Thus, targeting AR in advanced prostate cancer requires the development of agents that can sustainably degrade variant isoforms for effective therapy.

Despite different mechanisms of action, all three SARDs degraded wild-type AR and inhibited AR function, exhibiting greater inhibitory potency than the approved AR antagonists.

Many men present with locally advanced or metastatic cancer for whom curative surgery is inappropriate. Advanced cancer patients are encouraged to remain physically active and therefore there is a need to investigate how patients with metastatic disease tolerate physical activity programmes. Physical activity reduces levels of systemic inflammatory mediators and so an aerobic exercise intervention may represent an accessible and cost-effective means of ameliorating the pro-inflammatory effects of obesity and subsequently decrease poor cancer-specific outcomes in this patient population. This study will assess the feasibility and safety of introducing a structured aerobic exercise intervention to an advanced cancer population. This study will also examine if the evasion of immune editing by circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is an exercise-modifiable mechanism in obese men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This international multicentre prospective study will recruit men with metastatic prostate cancer. Participants will be recruited from centres in Dublin (Ireland) and London (UK). Participants will be divided into exposed and non-exposed groups based on body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 and randomised to intervention and control groups. The exercise group will undertake a regular supervised aerobic exercise programme, whereas the control group will not. Exercise intensity will be prescribed based on a target heart rate monitored by a polar heart rate monitor. Blood samples will be taken at recruitment and at 3 and 6 months to examine the primary endpoint of platelet cloaking of CTCs. Participants will complete a detailed questionnaire to assess quality of life (QoL) and other parameters at each visit.  Discussion:   The overall aim of the ExPeCT trial is to examine the relationship between PrCa, exercise, obesity, and systemic inflammation, and to improve the overall QoL in men with advanced disease.

Argumentation for cessation of LHRH therapy is the prolonged suppression of testosterone levels after the withdrawal of LHRH analogues and the fact that disease progression occurs despite castration levels of testosterone. Especially upon treatment with the life-prolonging cytochrome P450 17-alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp17)-inhibitor, abiraterone, which has the ability to further suppress testosterone serum levels over LHRH therapy alone, continuation of LHRH therapy seems to be negligible. However, the proven increase of luteinizing hormone levels after LHRH withdrawal, which is even further increased by abiraterone, may counteract the effects of abiraterone by the induction of enzymes of steroidogenesis. Therefore, cessation of LHRH therapy when starting treatment with abiraterone in CRPC may display an unpredictable hazard to the patients. This study will explore the role of continuation of LHRH therapy when starting treatment with abiraterone in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, chemotherapy-naïve CPRC.  Methods/design:   The trial will assess radiographic progression-free survival after 12 months of treatment with abiraterone/prednisone in patients who will be randomized to receive continuing LHRH therapy versus LHRH withdrawal at the time of starting abiraterone therapy.  Discussion:   This multicenter, prospective, randomized, exploratory phase-II trial will bring about new data regarding the efficacy and safety of abiraterone/prednisone treatment with or without continuation of LHRH therapy. In addition, further insight into the complex hormonal changes under treatment will be gained and the results of this trial may give rise to a larger phase-III trial to examine the possibility of withdrawing LHRH therapy in patients with CRPC.

Although STS is considered a therapeutic target for estrogen-dependent diseases, the cellular functions of STS remain unclear. We found that STS induces Wnt/β-catenin s Delete ignaling in PC-3 and HeLa cells. STS increases levels of β-catenin, phospho-β-catenin, and phospho-GSK3β. Enhanced translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus by STS might activate transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and MMP-7. STS knockdown by siRNA resulted in downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. β-Catenin/TCF-mediated transcription was also enhanced by STS. STS induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as it reduced the levels of E-cadherin, whereas levels of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and vimentin were enhanced. We found that STS induced Twist1 expression through HIFα activation as HIF-1α knockdown significantly blocks the ability of STS to induce Twist1 transcription. Furthermore, DHEA, but not DHEAS is capable of inducing Twist1. Treatment with a STS inhibitor prevented STS-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Twist1 expression. Interestingly, cancer cell migration, invasion, and MMPs expression induced by STS were also inhibited by a STS inhibitor.

DNA adducts reflect the internal exposure to genotoxicants and can serve as biomarkers for risk assessment. Liquid chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) is the most common method for biomonitoring DNA adducts, generally targeting single exposures and measuring up to several adducts. However, the data often provide limited evidence for a role of a chemical in the etiology of cancer. An ""untargeted"" method is required that captures global exposures to chemicals, by simultaneously detecting their DNA adducts in the genome; some of which may induce cancer-causing mutations. We established a wide selected ion monitoring tandem mass spectrometry (wide-SIM/MS2) screening method utilizing ultraperformance-LC nanoelectrospray ionization Orbitrap MSn with online trapping to enrich bulky, nonpolar adducts.

Through a high-throughput/high-content screening of a 220,000-member small molecule library, we have previously identified 2-[(isoxazol-4-ylmethyl)thio]-1-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)ethanone (IMTPPE) (SID 3712502) as a novel small molecule capable of inhibiting AR transcriptional activity and protein level in C4-2 prostate cancer cells. In this study, we show that IMTPPE inhibits AR-target gene expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and luciferase assays. IMTPPE inhibited proliferation of AR-positive, but not AR-negative, prostate cancer cells in culture. IMTPPE inhibited the transcriptional activity of a mutant AR lacking the ligand-binding domain (LBD), indicating that IMTPPE inhibition of AR is independent of the LBD. Furthermore, animal studies showed that IMTPPE inhibited the growth of 22Rv1 xenograft tumor, a model for enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.

This recommendation takes into account the link between alcohol and several cancers; however, there is a dearth of high quality evidence from the UK to support this.  Methods:   Alcohol consumption using a detailed diary was obtained from 8670 adults representative of the UK population in 1984/5, with follow-up data from cancer registries until 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for several variables including cigarette smoking were calculated for cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum and prostate separately using Cox regression.  Results:   Units per week on a typical basis, fitted as a linear term, was associated with breast cancer in women (HR = 1.27 per 10 units/week; 95% CI 1.03-1.58) and lung cancer in men (HR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.27). Increased risks of lung (HR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.18-4.24) and colorectal (HR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.13-4.57) cancer were seen in men at 15-28 units/week along with higher levels of consumption.

Method:   We analyzed 695 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP), of whom 423 had serum TT collected. Patients were classified as having hypogonadism or eugonadism based on two thresholds of testosterone: threshold 1 (300 ng/dL) and threshold 2 (250 ng/dL). We evaluated the relation between TT levels and a Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7 in RP specimens. Outcomes were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses, accounting for race and other demographic predictors.  Results:   Out of 423 patients, 37.8% had hypogonadism based on the threshold 1 and 23.9% based on the threshold 2. Patients with hypogonadism, in both thresholds, had a higher chance of GS ≥ 7 (OR 1.79, p=0.02 and OR 2.08, p=0.012, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, TT, body mass index (BMI) and race, low TT (p=0.023) and age (p=0.002) were found to be independent risk factors for GS ≥ 7. Among Black individuals, low serum TT was a stronger predictor of high-grade disease compared to White men (p=0.02).

Extradomain B fibronectin (EDB-FN), an oncoprotein present in aggressive tumors, is a promising molecular target for detection and stratification of high-risk prostate cancer. In this work, we have identified four small peptides (GVK, IGK, SGV, and ZD2) specific to EDB-FN for tumor targeting. In silico simulations of the binding patterns and affinities of peptides to the EDB protein fragment revealed different binding site to different peptide in the ligand-receptor interactions. Tumor specificity and organ distribution of the peptides were assessed using fluorescence imaging in male mice bearing PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts. Targeted contrast agents were synthesized by conjugating tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to the peptides in the solid phase, followed by complexation with GdCl3. The contrast agents were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and relaxivity measurements. All four peptide Gd-DOTA conjugates resulted in robust tumor contrast enhancement in MR imaging of the PC3 mouse prostate cancer model.

Our method could potentially reduce the unwanted damage to OARs.  Methods:   We retrospectively generated plans for 10 patients including two prostate, four head and neck, and four lung cancer patients. The ""worst-case robust optimization"" model was applied. One additional term as a ""biological surrogate (BS)"" of OARs due to the high LET-related biological effects was added in the objective function. The biological surrogate was defined as the sum of the physical dose and extra biological effects caused by the dose-averaged LET. We generated nine uncertainty scenarios that considered proton range and patient setup uncertainty. Corresponding to each uncertainty scenario, LET was obtained by a fast LET calculation method developed in-house and based on Monte Carlo simulations. In each optimization iteration, the model used the worst-case BS among all scenarios and then penalized overly high BS to organs. The model was solved by an efficient algorithm (limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) in a parallel computing environment. Our new model was benchmarked with the conventional robust planning model without considering BS. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the dose assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 and BS for tumor and organs under nominal and uncertainty scenarios were compared to assess the plan quality between the two methods.  Results:   For the 10 cases, our model outperformed the conventional robust model in avoidance of high LET in OARs. At the same time, our method could achieve dose distributions and plan robustness of tumors assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 almost the same as those of the conventional robust model.  Conclusions:   Explicitly considering LET in IMPT robust treatment planning can reduce the high LET to OARs and minimize the possible toxicity of high RBE dose to OARs without sacrificing plan quality. We believe this will allow one to design and deliver safer proton therapy.""","""['Yu An', 'Jie Shan', 'Samir H Patel', 'William Wong', 'Steven E Schild', 'Xiaoning Ding', 'Martin Bues', 'Wei Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Robust treatment planning with conditional value at risk chance constraints in intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Rotating Gantries Provide Individualized Beam Arrangements for Charged Particle Therapy.', 'An iterative convex relaxation method for proton LET optimization.', 'Collimating individual beamlets in pencil beam scanning proton therapy, a dosimetric investigation.']"""

However, a proportion of these patients will continue to have no prostate cancer (PCa) identified on magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy (FB) despite abnormal mpMRI findings.  Methods:   In this multi-institutional, retrospective study, clinical and mpMRI parameters were assessed for 285 consecutive patients with at least 1 prior negative biopsy who underwent FB for a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 3 to 5 at the University of Rochester Medical Center from December 2014 to December 2016, or at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from February 2014 to February 2017. Nomograms were generated for predicting benign prostate pathology on both the targeted biopsy and the concurrent SB.  Results:   Benign pathology was found in 132 of 285 patients (46.3%). In a multivariate analysis, the predictors of benign prostate pathology on FB were age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, and PI-RADS score. The predicted probabilities were plotted on a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve was 0.825. The nomogram demonstrated excellent calibration and a high net benefit in a decision curve analysis. With a theoretical cutoff probability of ≥0.7 used to recommend deferment of FB, 61 of 285 patients (21.4%) would have avoided an unnecessary biopsy, and only 4 of 285 patients (1.4%) with PCa with a Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 would have been missed.  Conclusions:   False-positive mpMRI examinations may occur in up to 46.3% of patients with a prior negative biopsy. Thus, a multi-institutional nomogram has been developed and validated for predicting benign pathology after FB in patients with a prior negative biopsy, and this may help to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in the setting of abnormal mpMRI findings.

The current study examined whether the observed mortality reduction was due primarily to the prevention of incident CRC via removal of adenomatous polyps or to the early detection of cancer and improved survival.  Methods:   The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial randomized 154,900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years. Individuals underwent FS screening at baseline and at 3 or 5 years versus usual care. CRC-specific survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazards modeling. The authors estimated the percentage of CRC deaths averted by early detection versus primary prevention using a model that applied intervention arm survival rates to CRC cases in the usual-care arm and vice versa.  Results:   A total of 1008 cases of CRC in the intervention arm and 1291 cases of CRC in the usual-care arm were observed. Through 13 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference noted between the trial arms with regard to CRC-specific survival for all CRC (68% in the intervention arm vs 65% in the usual-care arm; P =.16) or proximal CRC (68% vs 62%, respectively; P = .11) cases; however, survival in distal CRC cases was found to be higher in the intervention arm compared with the usual-care arm (77% vs 66%; P<.0001). Within each arm, symptom-detected cases had significantly worse survival compared with screen-detected cases. Overall, approximately 29% to 35% of averted CRC deaths were estimated to be due to early detection and 65% to 71% were estimated to be due to primary prevention.  Conclusions:   CRC-specific survival was similar across arms in the PLCO trial, suggesting a limited role for early detection in preventing CRC deaths. Modeling suggested that approximately two-thirds of avoided deaths were due to primary prevention. Future CRC screening guidelines should emphasize primary prevention via the identification and removal of precursor lesions.

For sCT generation a whole pelvis MRI (1.6 mm 3D isotropic T2w SPACE sequence) was acquired. Patients received a routine planning CT scan. Co-registered whole pelvis CT and T2w MRI pairs were used as training images. Advanced tissue specific non-linear regression models to predict HU for the fat, muscle, bladder and air were created from co-registered CT-MRI image pairs. On a test case T2w MRI, the bones and bladder were automatically segmented using a novel statistical shape and appearance model, while other soft tissues were separated using an Expectation-Maximization based clustering model. The CT bone in the training database that was most 'similar' to the segmented bone was then transformed with deformable registration to create the sCT component of the test case T2w MRI bone tissue. Predictions for the bone, air and soft tissue from the separate regression models were successively combined to generate a whole pelvis sCT. The change in monitor units between the sCT-based plans relative to the gold standard CT plan for the same IMRT dose plan was found to be [Formula: see text] (mean ± standard deviation) for 39 patients. The 3D Gamma pass rate was [Formula: see text] (2 mm/2%). The novel hybrid model is computationally efficient, generating an sCT in 20 min from standard T2w images for prostate cancer radiation therapy dose planning and DRR generation.""","""['Soumya Ghose', 'Peter B Greer', 'Jidi Sun', 'Peter Pichler', 'David Rivest-Henault', 'Jhimli Mitra', 'Haylea Richardson', 'Chris Wratten', 'Jarad Martin', 'Jameen Arm', 'Leah Best', 'Jason A Dowling']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'A review of substitute CT generation for MRI-only radiation therapy.', 'Introduction of a Simple Algorithm to Create Synthetic-computed Tomography of the Head from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'MRI-only treatment planning: benefits and challenges.']"""

CSR1 has critical roles in the regulation of cell apoptosis via inactivation of CPSF3 or preventing the interaction of XIAP with caspases. However, whether CSR1 plays a role in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is completely unknown.  Patients and methods:   The expression of CSR1 in HCC clinic samples and cell lines was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system was used to knockout CSR1 gene in HepG2 cells. The proliferation of HCC cells was measured by MTT assay. The migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells were determined by in vitro scratch wounding and matrigel invasion assays. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the interaction between CSR1 and hematopoietic PBX interacting protein (HPIP).  Results:   The mRNA and protein levels of CSR1 were down-regulated in human HCC cell lines and clinic HCC tissues. Over-expression of CSR1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in human HCC cell lines. Knockout of CSR1 gene by CRISPR-Cas9 in HepG2 cells achieved the opposite effects. At the molecular level, we found that CSR1 associated with HPIP and inhibited the activation PI3K/AKT pathway.  Conclusions:   For the first time we demonstrated that CSR1 inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through inactivation of HPIP and its downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and suggested CSR1 as a potential therapy target for HCC treatment.""","""['L Jiang', 'G Hu', 'F-F Chen', 'X-Y Du', 'B Liu', 'C Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Suppressive effects of microRNA-16 on the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'PTEN inhibits the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells by coordinately decreasing MMP expression via the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'HPIP promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells through PI3K/AKT pathway activation.', 'Two decades of a protooncogene HPIP/PBXIP1: Uncovering the tale from germ cell to cancer.', 'Heat shock proteins in cancer: signaling pathways, tumor markers and molecular targets in liver malignancy.', ""Using Polygenic Hazard Scores to Predict Age at Onset of Alzheimer's Disease in Nordic Populations."", 'The plasma peptides of ovarian cancer.']"""

In the fall of 2014, a global temporary shortage of Ra-223 occurred for 2 months due to production irregularities. The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged interval between Ra-223 cycles to non-disease related causes had a negative impact on clinical outcome of therapy.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective single-center study of mCRPC patients who initiated Ra-223 therapy in the period from March 2014 to February 2015. End points were number of completed Ra-223 cycles, overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Bone scintigraphy, CT of thorax and abdomen, hematological status, PSA and alkaline phosphatase were evaluated prior to first dose and after 3rd and 6th treatment, respectively. Follow-up period was 18 months after first Ra-223 cycle.  Results:   A total of 50 consecutive patients initiated Ra-223 therapy in the time period. Seventeen of 50 patients (34%) had prolonged interval between cycles due to delivery problems. Median delay was 4 weeks (range 3-9 weeks). Patients with delayed treatment had significantly longer median rPFS [delayed patients: 7.1 months (95% CI 4.9-9.3) vs. 4.5 months (95% CI 2.8-6.3)].

Objective:   To determine whether, among patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance, those at higher risk for future stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) derive more benefit from the insulin-sensitizing drug pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with patients at lower risk.  Design, setting, and participants:   A secondary analysis was conducted of the Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone for secondary prevention. Patients were enrolled from 179 research sites in 7 countries from February 7, 2005, to January 15, 2013, and were followed up for a mean of 4.1 years through the study's end on July 28, 2015. Eligible participants had a qualifying ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 180 days of entry and insulin resistance without type 1 or type 2 diabetes.  Interventions:   Pioglitazone or matching placebo.  Main outcomes and measures:   A Cox proportional hazards regression model was created using baseline features to stratify patients above or below the median risk for stroke or MI within 5 years. Within each stratum, the efficacy of pioglitazone for preventing stroke or MI was calculated. Safety outcomes were death, heart failure, weight gain, and bone fracture.  Results:   Among 3876 participants (1338 women and 2538 men; mean [SD] age, 63 [11] years), the 5-year risk for stroke or MI was 6.0% in the pioglitazone group among patients at lower baseline risk compared with 7.9% in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, -1.9% [95% CI, -4.4% to 0.6%]). Among patients at higher risk, the risk was 14.7% in the pioglitazone group vs 19.6% for placebo (absolute risk difference, -4.9% [95% CI, -8.6% to 1.2%]). Hazard ratios were similar for patients below or above the median risk (0.77 vs 0.75; P = .92). Pioglitazone increased weight less among patients at higher risk but increased the risk for fracture more.  Conclusions and relevance:   After an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients at higher risk for stroke or MI derive a greater absolute benefit from pioglitazone compared with patients at lower risk.

However, CT has low tissue contrast, thus making manual contouring difficult. In contrast, magnetic resonance (MR) image provides high tissue contrast and is thus ideal for manual contouring. If MR image can be registered to CT image of the same patient, the contouring accuracy of CT could be substantially improved, which could eventually lead to high treatment efficacy. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for multimodal image registration. First, to fill the appearance gap between modalities, a structured random forest with auto-context model is learnt to synthesize MRI from CT and vice versa. Then, MRI-to-CT registration is steered in a dual manner of registering images with same appearances, i.e., (1) registering the synthesized CT with CT, and (2) also registering MRI with the synthesized MRI. Next, a dual-core deformation fusion framework is developed to iteratively and effectively combine these two registration results. Experiments on pelvic CT and MR images have shown the improved registration performance by our proposed method, compared with the existing non-learning based registration methods.""","""['Xiaohuan Cao', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Jianhua Yang', 'Guorong Wu', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Dual-core steered non-rigid registration for multi-modal images via bi-directional image synthesis.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Robust inverse-consistent affine CT-MR registration in MRI-assisted and MRI-alone prostate radiation therapy.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'A review on multimodal medical image fusion: Compendious analysis of medical modalities, multimodal databases, fusion techniques and quality metrics.', 'CBCT-based synthetic CT generated using CycleGAN with HU correction for adaptive radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Localization of Craniomaxillofacial Landmarks on CBCT Images Using 3D Mask R-CNN and Local Dependency Learning.', 'Real-time multimodal image registration with partial intraoperative point-set data.', 'CT-TEE Image Registration for Surgical Navigation of Congenital Heart Disease Based on a Cycle Adversarial Network.', 'Evaluation of an Open Source Registration Package for Automatic Contour Propagation in Online Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

The current study evaluates the activity and efficacy of the oral selective AR modulator RAD140 in in vivo and in vitro models of AR/ER+ breast cancer.Experimental Design: A series of in vitro assays were used to determine the affinity of RAD140 to 4 nuclear receptors and evaluate its tissue-selective AR activity. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of RAD140 as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib were evaluated in AR/ER+ breast cancer xenograft models.Results: RAD140 bound AR with high affinity and specificity and activated AR in breast cancer but not prostate cancer cells. Oral administration of RAD140 substantially inhibited the growth of AR/ER+ breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Activation of AR and suppression of ER pathway, including the ESR1 gene, were seen with RAD140 treatment. Coadministration of RAD140 and palbociclib showed improved efficacy in the AR/ER+ PDX models. In line with efficacy, a subset of AR-repressed genes associated with DNA replication was suppressed with RAD140 treatment, an effect apparently enhanced by concurrent administration of palbociclib.Conclusions: RAD140 is a potent AR agonist in breast cancer cells with a distinct mechanism of action, including the AR-mediated repression of ESR1 It inhibits the growth of multiple AR/ER+ breast cancer PDX models as a single agent, and in combination with palbociclib.

Methods and materials:   Patients treated with IMRT (n=6933) or 3D-CRT (n=16,289) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013 in the English National Health Service were identified using cancer registry data, the National Radiotherapy Dataset, and Hospital Episodes Statistics, the administrative database of care episodes in National Health Service hospitals. We developed a coding system that identifies severe toxicity (at least grade 3 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scoring system) according to the presence of a procedure and a corresponding diagnostic code in patients' Hospital Episodes Statistics records after radiation therapy. A competing risks regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), comparing the incidence of severe GI and GU complications after IMRT and 3D-CRT, adjusting for patient, disease, and treatment characteristics.  Results:   The use of IMRT, as opposed to 3D-CRT, increased from 3.1% in 2010 to 64.7% in 2013.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a systemic treatment shown to increase survival in selected patients with prostate cancer. The use of ADT continues to increase for all stages and grades of prostate cancer despite known treatment-induced adverse effects. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a targeted, multi-component resistance and impact-loading exercise programme together with a daily protein-, calcium- and vitamin D-enriched supplement on bone health in men treated with ADT for prostate cancer. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of this intervention on measures of total body and regional body composition, cardiometabolic risk, inflammatory markers, health-related quality of life and cognitive function.  Methods:   This study is a two-arm randomised controlled trial. Men currently treated with ADT for prostate cancer will be randomised to either a 52-week, community-based, exercise training and nutritional supplementation intervention (n = 51) or usual care control (n = 51). Participants will be assessed at baseline, 26 weeks and 52 weeks for all measures. The primary outcome measures are proximal femur and lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (BMD). Secondary outcomes comprise: changes in tibial and radial bone structure and strength, total body and regional body composition, muscle strength and function, as well as cardiometabolic health, catabolic/inflammatory and anabolic/anti-inflammatory cytokines, health-related quality of life and cognitive function.  Discussion:   This study investigates whether a multi-component intervention incorporating a targeted bone and muscle-loading programme in combination with a protein-, calcium- and vitamin D-enriched supplement can ameliorate multiple adverse effects of ADT when compared to usual care. The results will contribute to the development of exercise training and nutrition guidelines for optimising overall health in men treated with ADT for prostate cancer.

Using PSA >1 ng/ml for first-line risk stratification and the Stockholm 3 Model (S3M) blood-test >10% risk of Gleason Score > 7 prostate cancer to inform biopsy decisions has been suggested. We aimed to determine the effects of changing the PSA cutoff to perform reflex testing with S3M and the subsequent S3M cutoff to recommend prostate biopsy while maintaining the sensitivity to detect Gleason Score ≥ 7 prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used data from the prospective, population-based, paired, diagnostic Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study with participants invited by date of birth from the Swedish Population Register during 2012-2014. All participants underwent testing with PSA and S3M (a combination of plasma protein biomarkers [PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, hK2, MSMB, MIC1], genetic polymorphisms, and clinical variables [age, family, history, previous prostate biopsy, prostate exam]). Of 47,688 men in the STHLM3 main study, we used data from 3133 men with S3M >10% and prostate biopsy data. Logistic regression models were used to calculate prostate cancer detection rates and proportion saved biopsies.  Results:   44.2%, 62.5% and 67.9% of the participants had PSA <1, <1.5 and <1.7 ng/ml, respectively. Increasing the PSA cut-off for additional work-up from 1 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml would thus save 18.3% of the performed tests, 4.9% of the biopsies and 1.3% (10/765) of Gleason Grade ≥ 7 cancers would be un-detected. By lowering the S3M cutoff to recommend biopsy, sensitivity to high-grade prostate cancer can be restored, to the cost of increasing the number of performed biopsies modestly.  Conclusion:   The sensitivity to detect prostate cancer can be maintained when using different PSA cutoffs to perform additional testing. Biomarker cut-offs have implications on number of tests and prostate biopsies performed. A PSA cutoff of 1.5 ng/ml to perform additional testing such as the S3M test might be considered.

It is well established that prostate cancer is exposed to fluctuating oxygen tensions and both acute and chronic hypoxia exist, and these conditions can upregulate angiogenesis-associated proteins such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor A. Low-frequency low-intensity ultrasound with microbubbles can induce obvious microvessel damage in tumors, cause cell necrosis or apoptosis. However, there is no information about whether the blocking blood effect of low-frequency low-intensity ultrasound with microbubbles has an influence on hypoxia environment of prostate cancer. Therefore, we investigated the impact of different low-frequency low-intensity ultrasound with microbubbles radiation times on prostate tumors, observed the change in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor A protein levels, as well as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor volume. The results indicated that as the radiation was repeated four times on each treatment day, the effects of interruption were durable, the cell proliferation was inhibited, and apoptosis was promoted, and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor A expression levels were lower in the treatment group than in the control group. When the radiation was carried out once per treatment day, the hypoxia response was stimulated, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor A expression levels were higher compared with the control group, and cell proliferation was promoted. In addition, the tumor volume increased obviously in the hypoxia-stimulated group, whereas tumors grew slowly in the hypoxia-suppressed group. The results of this work demonstrated that under the same conditions, different radiation times of low-frequency low-intensity ultrasound with microbubbles affect the hypoxia response differently, and the effect at least partly stimulates or inhibits tumor growth.""","""['Rui Hou', 'Yanjun Xu', 'Qijie Lu', 'Yang Zhang', 'Bing Hu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Effects of low-frequency ultrasound and microbubbles on angiogenesis-associated proteins in subcutaneous tumors of nude mice.', 'Cellular characterization of ultrasound-stimulated microbubble radiation enhancement in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Inhibitory effects of antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone on growth and invasiveness of PC3 human prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia and Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness: A\xa0Tale With Many Endings.', 'Advances in low-frequency ultrasound combined with microbubbles in targeted tumor therapy.', 'Ultrasound Therapy, Chemotherapy and Their Combination for Prostate Cancer.', 'Focused Ultrasound for Immunomodulation of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Growth factors involve in cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration during prostate cancer metastasis.', 'H19-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of β3 and β4 Integrins Upon Estrogen and Hypoxia Favors Metastatic Potential in Prostate Cancer.', 'The reversal of MRP1 expression induced by low-frequency and low-intensity ultrasound and curcumin mediated by VEGF in brain glioma.']"""

Methods:   A total of 30 patients with biopsy-proven PCa with bone metastases underwent cryoablation and ADT treatment. The control group consisted of 30 men who were initially treated with ADT only and who were followed until progression, development of castration resistant PCa or death. Patients were pair matched for age, PSA level, clinical stage, preoperative biopsy Gleason score and bone metastases. Time to clinical progression, time to CRPC, cancer-specific survival and overall survival were analysed using descriptive statistical analysis.  Results:   Age at diagnosis, baseline PSA, biopsy Gleason score and ECOG status were comparable between the two groups. Prostate cryoablation was well tolerated and no serious complications occurred. At the last follow-up, patients in the cryoablation and ADT treatment group had a lower median PSA nadir (0.4 ng/ml vs. 0.8 ng/ml, p < 0.01) and longer time to CRPC (33 ± 0.9 mo vs. 22 ± 0.8 mo, p < 0.01).

The nuclear export signal of AR (NESAR) has an important role in AR intracellular trafficking and proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DHX15 as a novel AR co-activator using a yeast mutagenesis screen and revealed that DHX15 regulates AR activity by modulating E3 ligase Siah2-mediated AR ubiquitination independent of its ATPase activity. DHX15 and Siah2 form a complex with AR, through NESAR. DHX15 stabilized Siah2 and enhanced its E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity, resulting in AR activation. Importantly, DHX15 was upregulated in PCa specimens and its expression was correlated with Gleason scores and prostate-specific antigen recurrence. Furthermore, DHX15 immunostaining correlated with Siah2. Finally, DHX15 knockdown inhibited the growth of C4-2 prostate tumor xenografts in mice.

Methods:   Associations between ionizing radiation and site-specific solid cancer mortality were examined among 308,297 nuclear workers employed in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Workers were monitored for external radiation exposure and follow-up encompassed 8.2 million person-years. Radiation-mortality associations were estimated using a maximum-likelihood method and using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the latter used to fit a hierarchical regression model to stabilize estimates of association.  Results:   The analysis included 17,957 deaths attributable to solid cancer, the most common being lung, prostate, and colon cancer. Using a maximum-likelihood method to quantify associations between radiation dose- and site-specific cancer, we obtained positive point estimates for oral, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, peritoneum, larynx, lung, pleura, bone and connective tissue, skin, ovary, testis, and thyroid cancer; in addition, we obtained negative point estimates for cancer of the liver and gallbladder, prostate, bladder, kidney, and brain. Most of these estimated coefficients exhibited substantial imprecision. Employing a hierarchical model for stabilization had little impact on the estimated associations for the most commonly observed outcomes, but for less frequent cancer types, the stabilized estimates tended to take less extreme values and have greater precision than estimates obtained without such stabilization.

Successful utilization of this strategy can delay or prevent unnecessary interventions - thereby reducing morbidity associated with overtreatment. The usefulness of active surveillance primarily depends on correct identification of patients with low-risk disease. However, current population-wide algorithms and tools do not adequately exclude high-risk disease, thereby limiting the confidence of clinicians and patients to go on active surveillance. Novel imaging tools such as mpMRI provide information about the size and location of potential cancers enabling more informed treatment decisions. The term ""multiparametric"" in prostate mpMRI refers to the summation of several MRI series into one examination whose initial goal is to identify potential clinically-significant lesions suitable for targeted biopsy. The main advantages of MRI are its superior anatomic resolution and the lack of ionizing radiation. Recently, the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System has been instituted as an international standard for unifying mpMRI results. The imaging sequences in mpMRI defined by Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 includes: T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, derived apparent-diffusion coefficient from diffusion-weighted MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. The use of mpMRI prior to starting active surveillance could prevent those with missed, high-grade lesions from going on active surveillance, and reassure those with minimal disease who may be hesitant to take part in active surveillance. Although larger validation studies are still necessary, preliminary results suggest mpMRI has a role in selecting patients for active surveillance. Less certain is the role of mpMRI in monitoring patients on active surveillance, as data on this will take a long time to mature. The biggest obstacles to routine use of prostate MRI are quality control, cost, reproducibility, and access. Nevertheless, there is great a potential for mpMRI to improve outcomes and quality of treatment. The major roles of MRI will continue to expand and its emerging use in standard of care approaches becomes more clearly defined and supported by increasing levels of data.""","""['Julie Y An', 'Abhinav Sidana', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Bradford J.

However, after ZSP4 stimulation, the functions of prostate CAFs were inhibited. The mechanism experiment shows that ZSP4 can stimulate prostate CAFs by down-regulating the expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Polysaccharides extracted from Dictyophora indusiata stimulate the proliferation of immune cells and reverse the immune-suppressive functions of prostate CAFs, shedding new light on the development of novel anticancer strategies. The endocrine therapy used to treat prostate cancer aims to eliminate androgenic activity from prostatic tissue; these therapies are painful and of poor therapeutic effect.

We introduce 2 metrics to better quantify and report the deliverables of targeted biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed our prospective database of patients who underwent simultaneous multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Actionable intelligence metric was defined as the proportion of patients in whom targeted biopsy provided actionable information over transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Reduction metric was defined as the proportion of men in whom transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been omitted. We compared metrics in our cohort with those in prior reports.  Results:   A total of 371 men were included in study. The actionable intelligence and reduction metrics were 22.2% and 83.6% in biopsy naïve cases, 26.7% and 84.2% in prior negative transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy cases, and 24% and 77.5%, respectively, in active surveillance cases. No significant differences were observed among the groups in the actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric (p = 0.89 and 0.27, respectively). The actionable intelligence metric was 25.0% for PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) 3, 27.5% for PI-RADS 4 and 21.7% for PI-RADS 5 lesions (p = 0.73). Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been avoided in more patients with PI-RADS 3 compared to PI-RADS 4/5 lesions (reduction metric 92.0% vs 76.7%, p <0.01). Our results compare favorably to those of other reported series.  Conclusions:   The actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric are novel, clinically relevant quantification metrics to standardize the reporting of multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy deliverables. Targeted biopsy provides actionable information in about 25% of men. Reduction metric assessment highlights that transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy may only be omitted after carefully considering the risk of missing clinically significant cancers.""","""['Benjamin T Ristau', 'David Y T Chen', 'Jeffrey Ellis', 'Aseem Malhotra', 'Lyudmila DeMora', 'Rosaleen B Parsons', 'Barton Milestone', 'Marion Brody', 'Rosalia Viterbo', 'Richard Greenberg', 'Marc Smaldone', 'Robert Uzzo', 'Jordan Anaokar', 'Alexander Kutikov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Anterior Localization of Prostate Cancer Suspicious Lesions in 1,161 Patients Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsies.', 'A Single Center Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging against Transperineal Prostate Mapping Biopsy: An Analysis of Men with Benign Histology and Insignificant Cancer following Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy.', 'Detection of significant prostate cancer with magnetic resonance targeted biopsies--should transrectal ultrasound-magnetic resonance imaging fusion guided biopsies alone be a standard of care?', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of the Prostate-An Update.']"""

Currently, the Brazilian public health system cannot match the national radiotherapy demand and many patients requiring radiotherapy are never exposed to this treatment. This study estimated the number of preventable deaths in the public health system if access to radiotherapy was universal.  Materials and methods:   Incidence rates for the year 2016 provided by Instituto Nacional de Cancer were used in this analysis. The number of untreated patients requiring radiotherapy was obtained through the difference between the total number of patients requiring radiotherapy and the total amount of delivered radiotherapy treatments in the public health system. The number of deaths for the three most common cancers in each gender due to radiotherapy shortage was calculated. Initially, the total number of patients per cancer type was divided in stages using Brazilian epidemiological data. Subsequently, previously published tree arm diagrams were used to define the rate of patients requiring radiotherapy in each specific clinical setting. Finally, the clinical benefit of radiotherapy in overall survival was extracted from studies with level 1 evidence.  Results:   Over 596 000 cancer cases were expected in Brazil in 2016. The public health system covers more than 75% of the Brazilian population and an estimated 111 432 patients who required radiotherapy in 2016 did not receive this treatment. Breast, colorectal and cervix cancers are the most frequent malignant tumours in women and prostate, lung and colorectal in men. The number of deaths due to a radiotherapy shortage in the year 2016 for these types of cancer were: (i) breast: 1011 deaths in 10 years; (ii) cervix: 2006 deaths in 2 years; (iii) lung: 1206 deaths in 2 years; (iv) prostate, intermediate risk: 562 deaths in 13 years; high risk: 298 deaths in 10 years; (v) colorectal: 0 deaths, as radiotherapy has no proven benefit in overall survival.  Conclusion:   Thousands of cancer patients requiring radiotherapy do not have access to this treatment in the Brazilian public health system. The shortage of radiotherapy has a significant detrimental effect on cancer survival; over 5000 deaths would probably be prevented in the most common cancer types if radiotherapy access was universal.""","""['L C Mendez', 'F Y Moraes', 'G Dos S Fernandes', 'E Weltman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Lives and Economic Loss in Brazil due to Lack of Radiotherapy Access in Cervical Cancer: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.', 'Effect of screening for cancer in the Nordic countries on deaths, cost and quality of life up to the year 2017.', 'Positron emission tomography-adapted therapy for first-line treatment in individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Aspirin Use in Adults: Cancer, All-Cause Mortality, and Harms: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Cost-effectiveness of hypofractionated versus conventional fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of men with early glottic cancer: a study in the Brazilian public and private health system.', 'Lessons from the Brazilian radiotherapy expansion plan: A project database study.', 'Cost containment analysis and access to treatment associated with adopting hypofractionated radiation therapy from the Brazilian perspective.', 'Benefits of Adopting Hypofractionated Radiotherapy as a Standard of Care in Low-and Middle-Income Countries.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on the curative treatment of prostate cancer: a national cross-sectional study.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate GPS as a predictor of PCa metastasis and PCa-specific death (PCD) in a large cohort of men with localized PCa and long-term follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective study using a stratified cohort sampling design was performed in a cohort of men treated with RP within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. RNA from archival diagnostic biopsies was assayed to generate GPS results.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed the association between GPS and time to metastasis and PCD in prespecified uni- and multivariable statistical analyses, based on Cox proportional hazard models accounting for sampling weights.  Results and limitations:   The final study population consisted of 279 men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa between 1995 and 2010 (median follow-up 9.8 yr), and included 64 PCD and 79 metastases. Valid GPS results were obtained for 259 (93%). In univariable analysis, GPS was strongly associated with time to PCD, hazard ratio (HR)/20 GPS units=3.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.84-5.65; p<0.001), and time to metastasis, HR/20 units=2.75 (95% CI 1.63-4.63; p<0.001). The association between GPS and both end points remained significant after adjusting for National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Urological Association, and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risks (p<0.001). No patient with low- or intermediate-risk disease and a GPS of<20 developed metastases or PCD (n=31). In receiver operating characteristic analysis of PCD at 10 yr, GPS improved the c-statistic from 0.78 (CAPRA alone) to 0.84 (GPS+CAPRA; p<0.001). A limitation of the study was that patients were treated during an era when definitive treatment was standard of care with little adoption of active surveillance.  Conclusions:   GPS is a strong independent predictor of long-term outcomes in clinically localized PCa in men treated with RP and may improve risk stratification for men with newly diagnosed disease.  Patient summary:   Many prostate cancers are slow growing and unlikely to spread or threaten a man's life, while others are more aggressive and require treatment. Increasingly, doctors are using new molecular tests, such as the17-gene Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), which can be performed at the time of initial diagnosis to help determine how aggressive a given patient's cancer may be. In this study, performed in a large community-based healthcare network, GPS was shown to be a strong predictor as to whether a man's prostate cancer will spread and threaten his life after surgery, providing information that may help patients and their doctors decide on the best course of management of their disease.""","""['Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Ruixiao Lu', 'Nan Zhang', 'Charles P Quesenberry Jr', 'Jun Shan', 'Jeong S Han', 'Athanasios C Tsiatis', 'Amethyst D Leimpeter', 'H Jeffrey Lawrence', 'Phillip G Febbo', 'Joseph C Presti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score Predicts Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy and Adverse Surgical Pathology in a Racially Diverse Population of Men with Clinically Low- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Ability of a Genomic Classifier to Predict Metastasis and Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality after Radiation or Surgery based on Needle Biopsy Specimens.', 'Comparing Prognostic Utility of a Single-marker Immunohistochemistry Approach with Commercial Gene Expression Profiling Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'The 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Is Prognostic for Biochemical Failure in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy at a Community Cancer Center.', 'Relationship between Proclarix and the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.', 'Lymphatic Dissemination in Prostate Cancer: Features of the Transcriptomic Profile and Prognostic Models.', 'Genomic Prostate Score: A New Tool to Assess Prognosis and Optimize Radiation Therapy Volumes and ADT in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Increasing aggressive prostate cancer.']"""

We hypothesized that clinical, demographic, and treatment-related factors differentially affect fatigue and aimed to better characterize variables related to fatigue development in prostate cancer (PC) patients during EBRT.  Methods and materials:   We identified a cohort of 681 patients with nonmetastatic PC undergoing a 6- to 9-week EBRT course. Patient fatigue scores (range, 0-3) were prospectively recorded by providers during treatment visits using standardized criteria. Clinical and demographic factors including age, race, EBRT details, disease staging, smoking status, comorbidities, urinary symptoms, employment status, weight, and concurrent medication use were assessed for their relationship to fatigue levels. Significant differences in fatigue severity by each variable at the beginning and end of EBRT were assessed by nonparametric means testing, and differences in the level of fatigue increase over the treatment course were assessed using an ordered logistic regression model.  Results:   Significant increases in reported fatigue severity were seen in patients with age <60 years (P = .006), depressive symptoms (P < .001), and use of androgen deprivation therapy before radiation start (P = .04). In addition, the prescription of antiemetics before radiation start was associated with reduced fatigue severity (P = .03).  Conclusions:   We identify factors associated with increased (young age, depressive symptoms, androgen deprivation therapy) and decreased (antiemetic prescription) fatigue in a large cohort of PC patients receiving EBRT. Continued investigation is needed to further elucidate clinical drivers and biological underpinnings of increased fatigue to guide potential interventions.""","""['Hann-Hsiang Chao', 'Abigail Doucette', 'David M Raizen', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Localized External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) to the Pelvis Induces Systemic IL-1Beta and TNF-Alpha Production: Role of the TNF-Alpha Signaling in EBRT-Induced Fatigue.', 'Co-Occurring Symptoms Contribute to Persistent Fatigue in Prostate Cancer.', 'Managing cancer-related fatigue in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions.', 'Radiotherapy-related fatigue.', 'Correlates of Cancer-Related Fatigue among Colorectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy Based on the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms.', 'Circulating levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy: associations with acute radiotoxicity and fatigue symptoms.', 'Factors Affecting the Severity of Fatigue during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer; an Exploratory Study.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the hospital burden of long-term genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity among patients with PCa who were treated with radiotherapy at our institution.  Methods:   The radiotherapy department database was used retrospectively to identify all patients who underwent radiotherapy for PCa from January 2006 to January 2008. The patient administration system from each public hospital in the region was interrogated and all patient points of contact were recorded. Minimum follow up was 5 years. Individual patient charts were reviewed and factors that might influence outcomes were documented.  Results:   We identified 112 patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 66 (44-76) and the median PSA was 12.1 (3.2-38). The mean duration of follow-up was 7.8 yrs. Twenty-three patients (20%) presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with late onset toxicity. Nine patients had more than 2 ED attendances. Twenty-five patients (22%) were investigated for genitourinary toxicity. Forty-seven patients (42%) underwent investigation for gastrointestinal side-effects and 45% of these required argon therapy (21/47).  Conclusion:   We found a significant hospital burden related to the management of gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity post radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer. As health care reforms gain momentum, policy makers must take into account the considerable longitudinal health care cost related to radiotherapy. It is also important that patients are counselled carefully in relation to potential long-term side-effects.""","""['Elaine J Redmond', 'Katelyn S Dolbec', 'Aisling S Fawaz', 'Hugh D Flood', 'Subhasis K Giri']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Surgeon""","""['High-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer: genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicity and outcomes, a single-institution experience.', 'Intensity-modulated versus conventional pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of acute toxicity.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated radiation therapy versus conventional radiation therapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review of its safety and efficacy.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Medical Resource Use and Medical Costs for Radiotherapy-Related Adverse Effects: A Systematic Review.', 'Germline variants disrupting microRNAs predict long-term genitourinary toxicity after prostate cancer radiation.']"""

This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the adverse pathological results of candidates eligible for active surveillance.  Methods:   A total of 904 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in this single institute, from 2005 to April 2014. One hundred and thirty-two patients were eligible for active surveillance (AS). Candidates for active surveillance were defined as low risk (T1/T2a, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, and Gleason score 6 or less) and very low risk (T1c, prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or less, Gleason score 6 or less, 2 or fewer positive biopsy cores, 50% or less cancer involvement per core) patients. Adverse pathological results were defined as Gleason sum more than 6, and non-organ-confined disease.  Results:   There were 132 patients eligible for active surveillance. One hundred and thirteen (85.6%, 113/132) patients had low risk disease and nineteen (14.4%, 19/132) patients had very low risk disease.

In this study, we describe GPs' reports of how they put different preventive recommendations into practice.  Design, setting and participants:   Cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 in Switzerland and France. 3400 randomly selected GPs were asked to complete a postal (n=1100) or online (n=2300) questionnaire. GPs who exclusively practiced complementary and alternative medicine were not eligible for the study. 764 GPs (response rate: postal 47%, online 11%) returned the questionnaire (428 in Switzerland and 336 in France).  Main outcome measures:   We investigated how the GPs performed five preventive practices (screening for dyslipidaemia, colorectal and prostate cancer, identification of hazardous alcohol consumption and brief intervention), examining which age group they selected, the screening frequency, the test they used, whether they favoured shared decision for prostate cancer screening and their definition of hazardous alcohol use.  Results:   A large variability was observed in the way in which GPs provide these practices. 41% reported screening yearly for cholesterol, starting and stopping at variable ages. 82% did not use any test to identify hazardous drinking. The most common responses for defining hazardous drinking were, for men, ≥21 drinks/week (24%) and ≥4 drinks/occasion for binge drinking (20%), and for women, ≥14 drinks/week (28%) and ≥3 drinks/occasion (21%). Screening for colorectal cancer, mainly with colonoscopy in Switzerland (86%) and stool-based tests in France (93%), was provided every 10 years in Switzerland (65%) and 2 years in France (91%) to patients between 50 years (87%) and 75 years (67%). Prostate cancer screening, usually with shared decision (82%), was provided yearly (62%) to patients between 50 years (74%) and 75-80 years (32%-34%).

The impact across different services is not well documented and utilization of emergency departments (ED) by cancer patients is not well characterized. The aim of our study was to identify factors that can be addressed to improve the appropriate delivery of quality cancer care thereby reducing ED utilization, decreasing hospitalizations and reducing the related healthcare costs.  Methods:   The New Jersey State Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases were used to identify the primary outcome variables; patient disposition and readmission rates. The independent variables were demographics, payer and clinical characteristics. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression models using clinical and demographic data were used to predict hospital admission or emergency department return.  Results:   A total of 37,080 emergency department visits were cancer related with the most common diagnosis attributed to lung cancer (30.0%) and the most common presentation was pain. The disposition of patients who visit the ED due to cancer related issues is significantly affected by the factors of race (African American OR=0.6, p value=0.02 and Hispanic OR=0.5, p value=0.02, respectively), age aged 65 to 75years (SNF/ICF OR 2.35, p value=0.00 and Home Healthcare Service OR 5.15, p value=0.01, respectively), number of diagnoses (OR 1.26, p value=0.00), insurance payer (SNF/ICF OR 2.2, p value=0.02 and Home Healthcare Services OR 2.85, p value=0.07, respectively) and type of cancer (breast OR 0.54, p value=0.01, prostate OR 0.56, p value=0.01, uterine OR 0.37, p value=0.02, and other OR 0.62, p value=0.05, respectively). In addition, comorbidities increased the likelihood of death, being transferred to SNF/ICF, or utilization of home healthcare services (OR 1.6, p value=0.00, OR 1.18, p value=0.00, and OR 1.16, p value=0.04, respectively). Readmission is significantly affected by race (American Americans OR 0.41, standard error 0.08, p value=0.001 and Hispanics OR 0.29, standard error 0.11, p value=0.01, respectively), income (Quartile 2 OR 0.98, standard error 0.14, p value 0.01, Quartile 3 OR 1.07, standard error 0.13, p value 0.01, and Quartile 4 OR 0.88, standard error 0.12, p value 0.01, respectively), and type of cancer (prostate OR 0.25, standard error 0.09, p value=0.001).

A new radiopharmaceutical, 68Ga-labeled tris(hydroxypyridinone) (THP)-PSMA, has a simplified design for single-step kit-based radiolabeling. It features the THP ligand, which forms complexes with 68Ga3+ rapidly at a low concentration, at room temperature, and over a wide pH range, enabling direct elution from a 68Ge/68Ga generator into a lyophilized radiopharmaceutical kit in 1 step without manipulation. The aim of this phase 1 study was to assess the safety and biodistribution of 68Ga-THP-PSMA. Methods: Cohort A comprised 8 patients who had proven prostate cancer and were scheduled to undergo prostatectomy; they had Gleason scores of 7-10 and a mean prostate-specific antigen level of 7.8 μg/L (range, 5.4-10.6 μg/L). They underwent PET/CT after the administration of 68Ga-THP-PSMA. All patients proceeded to prostatectomy (7 with pelvic nodal dissection). Dosimetry from multi-time-point PET imaging was performed with OLINDA/EXM. Cohort B comprised 6 patients who had positive 68Ga-HBED-PSMA-11 PET/CT scanning results and underwent comparative 68Ga-THP-PSMA scanning. All patients were monitored for adverse events. Results: No adverse events occurred. In cohort A, 6 of 8 patients had focal uptake in the prostate (at 2 h: average SUVmax, 5.1; range, 2.4-9.2) and correlative 3+ staining of prostatectomy specimens on PSMA immunohistochemistry. The 2 68Ga-THP-PSMA scans with negative results had only 1+/2+ staining. The mean effective dose was 2.07E-02 mSv/MBq. In cohort B, 68Ga-THP-PSMA had lower physiologic background uptake than 68Ga-HBED-PSMA-11 (in the parotid glands, the mean SUVmax for 68Ga-THP-PSMA was 3.6 [compared with 19.2 for 68Ga-HBED-PSMA-11]; the respective corresponding values in the liver were 2.7 and 6.3, and those in the spleen were 2.7 and 10.5; P < 0.001 for all). In 5 of 6 patients, there was concordance in the number of metastases identified with 68Ga-HBED-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-THP-PSMA. Thirteen of 15 nodal abnormalities were subcentimeter. In 22 malignant lesions, the tumor-to-liver contrast with 68Ga-THP-PSMA was similar to that with 68Ga-HBED-PSMA (4.7 and 5.4, respectively; P = 0.15), despite a higher SUVmax for 68Ga-HBED-PSMA than for 68Ga-THP-PSMA (30.3 and 10.7, respectively; P < 0.01). Conclusion:68Ga-THP-PSMA is safe and has a favorable biodistribution for clinical imaging. Observed focal uptake in the prostate was localized to PSMA-expressing malignant tissue on histopathology.

Methods: Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer underwent simultaneous 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI before radical prostatectomy. Volumes of interest (VOIs) for prostate tumors, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) nodules, prostatitis, and healthy tissue were delineated on T2-weighted images, using histology as a reference. Tumor VOIs were marked as high-grade (≥Gleason grade group 3) or not. MRI and PET features were extracted on the voxel and VOI levels. Partial least-squared discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with double leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to distinguish tumors from benign tissue (BPH, prostatitis, or healthy tissue) and high-grade tumors from other tissue (low-grade tumors or benign tissue). The performance levels of PET, MRI, and combined PET/MRI features were compared using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Voxel and VOI features were extracted from 40 tumor VOIs (26 high-grade), 36 BPH VOIs, 6 prostatitis VOIs, and 37 healthy-tissue VOIs. PET/MRI performed better than MRI and PET alone for distinguishing tumors from benign tissue (AUCs of 87%, 81%, and 83%, respectively, at the voxel level and 96%, 93%, and 93%, respectively, at the VOI level) and high-grade tumors from other tissue (AUCs of 85%, 79%, and 81%, respectively, at the voxel level and 93%, 93%, and 91%, respectively, at the VOI level).

However, mice with prostate-specific transgenic expression of prostate cancer-associated ERG alone fail to develop prostate cancer, highlighting that ERG requires other lesions to drive prostate tumorigenesis. Forkhead box (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1 is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in human prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate that FOXO1, but not other FOXO proteins (FOXO3 and FOXO4), binds and inhibits the transcriptional activity of prostate cancer-associated ERG independently of FOXO1 transcriptional activity. Knockdown of endogenous FOXO1 increased invasion of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive VCaP cells, an effect completely abolished by ERG knockdown. Patient specimen analysis demonstrated that FOXO1 and ERG protein expression inversely correlated in a subset of human prostate cancer. Although human ERG transgene expression or homozygous deletion of Foxo1 alone in the mouse prostate failed to promote tumorigenesis, concomitant ERG transgene expression and Foxo1 deletion resulted in upregulation of ERG target genes, increased cell proliferation, and formation of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Overall, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that aberrantly activated ERG cooperates with FOXO1 deficiency to promote prostate tumorigenesis and cell invasion.

Since the mutagenesis of mitochondrial genome in mammals is not possible yet, we have exploited budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a model to study the effects of tumor-associated mutations in the mitochondrial MTATP6 gene, encoding subunit 6 of ATP synthase, on the energy metabolism. We previously reported that four mutations in this gene have a limited impact on the production of cellular energy. Here we show that two mutations, Atp6-P163S and Atp6-K90E (human MTATP6-P136S and MTATP6-K64E, found in prostate and thyroid cancer samples, respectively), increase sensitivity of yeast cells both to compounds inducing oxidative stress and to high concentrations of calcium ions in the medium, when Om45p, the component of porin complex in outer mitochondrial membrane (OM), was fused to GFP. In OM45-GFP background, these mutations affect the activation of yeast permeability transition pore (yPTP, also called YMUC, yeast mitochondrial unspecific channel) upon calcium induction. Moreover, we show that calcium addition to isolated mitochondria heavily induced the formation of ATP synthase dimers and oligomers, recently proposed to form the core of PTP, which was slower in the mutants. We show the genetic evidence for involvement of mitochondrial ATP synthase in calcium homeostasis and permeability transition in yeast.

Previous evidence has shown that patients are prepared to bypass their nearest cancer centre to receive surgery at more distant centres that better meet their needs. In this national, population-based study we investigated the effect of patient mobility and hospital competition on service configuration and technology adoption in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using prostate cancer surgery as a model.  Methods:   We mapped all patients in England who underwent radical prostatectomy between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2014, according to place of residence and treatment location. For each radical prostatectomy centre we analysed the effect of hospital competition (measured by use of a spatial competition index [SCI], with a score of 0 indicating weakest competition and 1 indicating strongest competition) and the effect of being an established robotic radical prostatectomy centre at the start of 2010 on net gains or losses of patients (difference between number of patients treated in a centre and number expected based on their residence), and the likelihood of closing their radical prostatectomy service.  Findings:   Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2014, 19 256 patients underwent radical prostatectomy at an NHS provider in England. Of the 65 radical prostatectomy centres open at the start of the study period, 23 (35%) had a statistically significant net gain of patients during 2010-14. Ten (40%) of these 23 were established robotic centres. 37 (57%) of the 65 centres had a significant net loss of patients, of which two (5%) were established robotic centres and ten (27%) closed their radical prostatectomy service during the study period. Radical prostatectomy centres that closed were more likely to be located in areas with stronger competition (highest SCI quartile [0·87-0·92]; p=0·0081) than in areas with weaker competition. No robotic surgery centre closed irrespective of the size of net losses of patients. The number of centres performing robotic surgery increased from 12 (18%) of the 65 centres at the beginning of 2010 to 39 (71%) of 55 centres open at the end of 2014.  Interpretation:   Competitive factors, in addition to policies advocating centralisation and the requirement to do minimum numbers of surgical procedures, have contributed to large-scale investment in equipment for robotic surgery without evidence of superior outcomes and contributed to the closure of cancer surgery units. If quality performance and outcome indicators are not available to guide patient choice, these policies could threaten health services' ability to deliver equitable and affordable cancer care.

Patients and methods:   In this multicentre, prospective outcome study, 807 consecutive biopsy-naïve patients underwent MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy, as the first diagnostic intervention, between 10/2012 and 05/2016. MRI was reported following the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) criteria. In all, 236 patients had 18-24 systematic transperineal biopsies only, and 571 patients underwent additional targeted biopsies either by MRI-fusion or cognitive targeting if PI-RADS ≥3 lesions were present. Detection rates for any and Gleason score 7-10 cancer in targeted and overall biopsy were calculated and predictive values were calculated for different PI-RADS and PSA density (PSAD) groups.  Results:   Cancer was detected in 68% of the patients (546/807) and Gleason score 7-10 cancer in 49% (392/807). The negative predictive value of 236 PI-RADS 1-2 MRI in combination with PSAD of <0.1 ng/mL/mL for Gleason score 7-10 was 0.91 (95% confidence interval ± 0.07, 8% of study population).

The organoids also expressed a basal cell marker, CK5, and a luminal cell marker, CK8. CD49f-sorted basal cell organoids rapidly grew compared with CD24-sorted luminal cell organoids. The population of CD44-positive cells was the highest in both organoids and the original urine cells. Tumors were successfully formed with the injection of the organoids into immunodeficient mice. Treatment with a microtubule inhibitor, docetaxel, but not a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, piroxicam, and an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, decreased the cell viability of organoids. Treatment with a Hedgehog signal inhibitor, GANT61, increased the radiosensitivity in the organoids.

We recently identified zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 5 (ZIC5) as a factor that promotes melanoma aggressiveness by platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD) expression. However, its roles in other cancer types remain largely unknown. Here we determined the roles of ZIC5 in prostate cancer (PCa) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Results showed that ZIC5 was highly expressed in CRC and dedifferentiated PCa tissues, whereas little expression was observed in relevant normal tissues. Knockdown of ZIC5 decreased proliferation of several PCa and CRC cell lines with induction of cell death. ZIC5 knockdown significantly suppressed PDGFD expression transcriptionally, and PDGFD suppression also decreased proliferation of PCa and CRC cell lines. In addition, suppression of ZIC5 or PDGFD expression decreased levels of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) which are associated with PCa and CRC aggressiveness. Furthermore, knockdown of ZIC5 or PDGFD enhanced death of PCa and CRC cells induced by the anti-cancer drugs docetaxel or oxaliplatin, respectively. These results suggest that ZIC5 and PDGFD promote survival of PCa and CRC cells by enhancing FAK and STAT3 activity, and that the roles of ZIC5 are consistent across several cancer types.""","""['Reiko Satow', 'Shota Inagaki', 'Chiaki Kato', 'Makoto Shimozawa', 'Kiyoko Fukami']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['ZIC5 Drives Melanoma Aggressiveness by PDGFD-Mediated Activation of FAK and STAT3.', 'Zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through enhanced CDK1/CDC25c signaling.', 'AR-regulated ZIC5 contributes to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'SLC25A22 Promotes Proliferation and Survival of Colorectal Cancer Cells With KRAS Mutations and Xenograft Tumor Progression in Mice via Intracellular Synthesis of Aspartate.', 'Zic family member 5 promotes survival in human pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells.', 'The association and clinical relevance of phase-separating protein CAPRIN1 with noncoding RNA.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of RNA-seq Data Reveals Genes Related to Cancer Stem Cells in Colorectal Cancerogenesis.', 'A novel focal adhesion-related risk model predicts prognosis of bladder cancer -- a bioinformatic study based on TCGA and GEO database.', 'Patulin and LL-Z1640-2 induce apoptosis of cancer cells by decreasing endogenous protein levels of Zic family member 5.', 'Constructed the ceRNA network and predicted a FEZF1-AS1/miR-92b-3p/ZIC5 axis in colon cancer.']"""

A case-control study, including 150 prostate cancer patients and 155 healthy men, was done to examine the possible association between IL1A 4-bp ins/del polymorphism and PCa risk in a sample of southeast Iranian population. Mismatched polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was designed for genotyping the studied variant. Our findings showed that 4-bp ins/del polymorphism significantly increased the risk of PCa in codominant, recessive and allelic inheritance model. We also evaluated the association between the IL1A 4-bp ins/del polymorphism and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients, and found a significant association between 4-bp ins/del variant and stage, perineural invasion and surgical margin of tumor samples. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the ins/del variant affected the IL1A mRNA stability leading to a structural shift in IL1A mRNA and has-miR-125a-3p hybrid.

A retrospective study from 104 lesions with histological ground truth""","""Background:   Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by means of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a current challenge for the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) tools. An innovative CAD-software (Watson Elementary™) was proposed to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, as well as to allege a correlate to Gleason grade.  Aim/objective:   To assess the performance of Watson Elementary™ in automated PCa diagnosis in our hospital´s database of MRI-guided prostate biopsies.  Methods:   The evaluation was retrospective for 104 lesions (47 PCa, 57 benign) from 79, 64.61±6.64 year old patients using 3T T2-weighted imaging, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps and dynamic contrast enhancement series. Watson Elementary™ utilizes signal intensity, diffusion properties and kinetic profile to compute a proportional Gleason grade predictor, termed Malignancy Attention Index (MAI). The analysis focused on (i) the CAD sensitivity and specificity to classify suspect lesions and (ii) the MAI correlation with the histopathological ground truth.  Results:   The software revealed a sensitivity of 46.80% for PCa classification. The specificity for PCa was found to be 75.43% with a positive predictive value of 61.11%, a negative predictive value of 63.23% and a false discovery rate of 38.89%. CAD classified PCa and benign lesions with equal probability (P 0.06, χ2 test). Accordingly, receiver operating characteristic analysis suggests a poor predictive value for MAI with an area under curve of 0.65 (P 0.02), which is not superior to the performance of board certified observers. Moreover, MAI revealed no significant correlation with Gleason grade (P 0.60, Pearson´s correlation).  Conclusion:   The tested CAD software for mpMRI analysis was a weak PCa biomarker in this dataset.

Methods:   A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 625 fathers of students attending eight public schools. The self-administered questionnaire included questions on: socio-demographic characteristics, personal and familiar medical history of prostate cancer, knowledge about prostate cancer and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, perception of risk towards prostate cancer, perception of the benefits of having a PSA-test, willingness to receive the PSA-test and sources of and needs of information regarding prostate cancer and the PSA-test.  Results:   72.7% of respondents had heard about the PSA-test and 51.1% of those had heard about it through their physicians. This knowledge was higher: in men with older age, in those that had a higher level of education, in those who had a relative with prostrate problems or prostate cancer and in those with prostate problems. Perceived personal risk of contracting prostate cancer was associated with a higher level of education, in those who had received information about prostate cancer from a physician and in those with prostate problems. Only 29.6% of men had undergone a PSA-test and 59.4% were willing to do so in the future. The significant predictors of the willingness to receive a PSA-test were the belief that the PSA-test was useful, the perception of not very good personal health status, and need of additional information about the PSA-test.

Therefore, we investigated the in vitro effects of Apixaban on cell proliferation, mortality, cell migration, gene expression and matrix metalloproteinase in 5 different cancer cell lines.  Methods:   The following cancer cell lines, and 2 normal fibroblast cultures (lung and dermal fibroblasts), were studied: OVCAR3 (ovarian cancer), MDA MB 231 (breast cancer), CaCO-2 (colon cancer), LNCaP (prostate cancer) and U937 (histiocytic lymphoma). Proliferation and cell mortality were assessed in control cells and Apixaban treated cultures (dose from 0.1 to 5 μg/ml, 0 to 96-h). Necrosis/Apoptosis (fluorescence microscopy), cell migration (24-h after scratch test), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and mRNA expression (RT PCR) of p16, p21, p53 and HAS were also assessed.  Results:   High-dose (5 μg/ml) Apixaban incubation was associated with a significantly reduced proliferation in 3 cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, CaCO-2 and LNCaP) and with increased cancer cell mortality in all, except LNCaP, cancer lines. Apoptosis seems to account for the increased mortality. The migration capacity seems to be impaired after high-dose Apixaban incubation in OVCAR3 and CaCO-2 cells. Data on mRNA expression suggest a consistent increase in tumor suppression gene p16 in all cell lines.

However, the detailed mechanism of EphA7-mediated prostate tumor progression remains elusive. To test the role of EphA7 receptor in prostate cancer (PCa) progression directly, we generated EphA7 receptor variants that were either lacking the cytoplasmic domain or carrying a point mutation that inhibits its phosphorylation by site-directed mutagenesis. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) EphA7 in PCa cells resulted in decreased tumor volume and increased tumor apoptosis in primary tumors. In addition, ectopic expression of WT EphA7 both can delay PCa cell proliferation and could inhibit PCa cell migration and invasion. This protein can also induce PCa cell apoptosis that correlated with increasing the protein expression levels of Bax, elevating the caspase-3 activities, reducing the protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and facilitating the dephosphorylation of Akt, which is further increased by the stimulation of ephrinA5-Fc. However, expression of these EphA7 mutants in PCa cells has no effect in vivo and in vitro. The expression of EphA7 and ephrinA5 was significantly decreased in PCa specimens compared with BPH tissues or paired normal tissues.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 2011, including 93 patients who underwent salvage RT and 69 patients who underwent salvage RT + ADT. The ADT-free duration after withdrawal was calculated to verify testosterone recovery.  Results:   Presalvage prostate serum antigen (PSA) was the only significantly different characteristic between the 2 groups (p < 0.001). The ADT-free duration was greater than 6 months in >80% of patients.

Materials and methods:   137 suspected prostatic abnormalities were identified on mp-MRI (1.5T) in 96 patients and classified according to PI-RADS score v2. All target lesions underwent US/mp-MRI fusion biopsy and prostatic sampling was completed by US-guided systematic random 12-core biopsies. Histological analysis and Gleason score were established for all the samples, both target lesions defined by mp-MRI, and random biopsies. PI-RADS score was correlated with the histological results, divided in three groups (benign tissue, atypia and carcinoma) and with Gleason groups, divided in four categories considering the new Grading system of the ISUP 2014, using t test. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate PI-RADS and Gleason categories to PSA level and abnormalities axial diameter. When the random core biopsies showed carcinoma (mp-MRI false-negatives), PSA value and lesions Gleason median value were compared with those of carcinomas identified by mp-MRI (true-positives), using t test.  Results:   There was statistically significant difference between PI-RADS score in carcinoma, atypia and benign lesions groups (4.41, 3.61 and 3.24, respectively) and between PI-RADS score in Gleason < 7 group and Gleason > 7 group (4.14 and 4.79, respectively). mp-MRI performance was more accurate for lesions > 15 mm and in patients with PSA > 6 ng/ml. In systematic sampling, 130 (11.25%) mp-MRI false-negative were identified. There was no statistic difference in Gleason median value (7.0 vs 7.06) between this group and the mp-MRI true-positives, but a significant lower PSA median value was demonstrated (7.08 vs 7.53 ng/ml).

Besides the well-known imprinting control region IGF2/H19-ICR, the involvement of a differentially methylated region in the promoter P0 of IGF2 gene (IGF2-DMR0) has been suggested. Here, we evaluate several mechanisms potentially leading to up- and/or down-regulation of IGF2 expression in prostate cancer and present a novel role of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) as a transcriptional regulator of IGF2 binding in IGF2-DMR0.  Methods:   Putative binding sites for transcription factors were identified in IGF2-DMR0 using JASPAR CORE database. Gene expressions were analyzed by RT-qPCR in prostate carcinoma and adjacent benign prostate hyperplasia samples obtained by radical prostatectomy (86 RP-PCa and 47 RP-BPH) and BPH obtained by transurethral prostate resection (13 TUR-BPH). Pyrosequencing and qMSP were used for DNA methylation studies in IGF2-DMR0, IGF2/H19-ICR and Glutathione-S-transferase-P1 (GSTP1) promoter. Loss of imprinting (LOI) was analyzed by RFLP. Copy number variation (CNV) test was performed using qBiomarker CNV PCR Assay. KLF4-binding and histone-modifications were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR in prostate cancer cell lines exhibiting differentially methylated IGF2-DMR0 (LNCaP hypomethylated and DU145 hypermethylated). KLF4 protein was analyzed by western blot. Statistical associations of gene expression to methylation, IGF2 LOI and CNV were calculated by Mann-Whitney-U-test. Correlations between gene expression and methylation levels were evaluated by Spearman's-Rank-Correlation-test.  Results:   We found a significant reduction of IGF2 expression in the majority of RP-PCa and RP-BPH in comparison to TUR-BPH. Analyzing potential molecular reasons, we found in RP-PCa and RP-BPH in comparison to TUR-BPH a significant hypomethylation of IGF2-DMR0, which coincided with hypermethylation of GSTP1-promoter, a prominent marker of prostate tumors. In contrast, IGF2 LOI and CNV did not associate significantly with up- and/or down-regulation of IGF2 expression in prostate tumors. By analyzing IGF2-DMR0, we detected a consensus sequence for KLF4 with a z-score of 7.6. Interestingly, we found that KLF4 binds to hypomethylated (17%) IGF2-DMR0 enriched with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (LNCaP), but does not bind under hypermethylated (85%) and H3K4me3-enriched conditions (DU145). KLF4 expression was detected in TUR-BPH as well as in RP-BPH and RP-PCa and showed a highly significant correlation to IGF2 expression.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated that in human prostate cancer the impairment of IGF2 expression is accompanied by hypomethylation of IGF2-DMR0. We revealed that KLF4 is a putative transcriptional regulator of IGF2, which binds in IGF2-DMR0 in dependence of the prevailing epigenetic state in this region. Herewith we provide complementary new insights into IGF2 dysregulation mechanisms as a critical process in prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['Undraga Schagdarsurengin', 'Angela Lammert', 'Natalie Schunk', 'Diana Sheridan', 'Stefan Gattenloehner', 'Klaus Steger', 'Florian Wagenlehner', 'Temuujin Dansranjavin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Aberrant epigenetic modifications in the CTCF binding domain of the IGF2/H19 gene in prostate cancer compared with benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'IGF2 DMR0 methylation, loss of imprinting, and patient prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Insulin-like growth factor 2 expression in prostate cancer is regulated by promoter-specific methylation.', 'Specific changes in the expression of imprinted genes in prostate cancer--implications for cancer progression and epigenetic regulation.', 'Epigenetic susceptibility factors for prostate cancer with aging.', 'Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19: An essential developmental regulator with expanding roles in cancer, stem cell differentiation, and metabolic diseases.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Hypermethylation of PRKCZ Regulated by E6 Inhibits Invasion and EMT via Cdc42 in HPV-Related Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Recent Discoveries on the Involvement of Krüppel-Like Factor 4 in the Most Common Cancer Types.', 'The Roles of Imprinted SLC22A18 and SLC22A18AS Gene Overexpression Caused by Promoter CpG Island Hypomethylation as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.']"""

We explored the opinions, experiences and perceived acceptability of taking part in nutritional and physical activity interventions amongst men with prostate cancer and their partners; with the ultimate plan to use such information to inform the development of nutritional and physical activity interventions for men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Semi-structured interviews with 16 men, and seven partners, undergoing curative surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Interviews explored experiences of lifestyle interventions, acceptable changes participants would make and perceived barriers and facilitators to change. Interviews were thematically analysed using the framework approach.  Results:   Men were frequently open to lifestyle modification and family support was considered vital to facilitate change. Health beneficial, clinician endorsed, understandable, enjoyable interventions were perceived as attractive. Barriers included 'modern' digital technology, poor weather, competing commitments or physical limitations, most notably incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Men were keen to participate in research, with few negative aspects identified.  Conclusions:   Men are willing to change behaviour but this needs to be supported by clinicians and health professionals facilitating lifestyle change. An 'intention-behaviour gap', when an intended behaviour does not materialise, may exist. Digital technology for data collection and lifestyle measurement may not be suitable for all, and post-surgery urinary incontinence is a barrier to physical activity.

Methods:   We investigated the cellular responses to GSK650394 treatment and SGK1 silencing (or overexpression) in human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and PC3 xenografts by flow cytometry, western blotting, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In the present study, we demonstrated that SGK1 inhibition, mediated by either GSK650394 or SGK1 shRNA, induced G2/M arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, 3MA-mediated autophagy inhibition attenuated SGK1 inhibition-induced apoptosis, suggesting that induction of autophagy precedes apoptosis. Moreover, ectopic expression of SGK1 significantly attenuated the GSK650394-induced effects. Suppression of mTOR and Foxo3a phosphorylation is critical for blockade of SGK1-induced autophagy and apoptosis, at least partially via pFoxo3a (S253)-LC3 and pFoxo3a (S253)-p27 interactions. Dual inhibition of mTOR and SGK1 enhances autophagy activation and leads to synergistic cytocidal effects in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   In summary, our findings show that SGK1 inhibition exhibits significant antitumour effects against PCa in vitro and in vivo.

In the multivariable analyses, ADT was associated with an increased risk of heart failure (adjusted HR=1.81, 95% CI 1.40-2.32) in men without preexisting CVD. Elevated risks of arrhythmia (adjusted HR=1.44, 95% CI 1.02-2.01), and conduction disorder (adjusted HR=3.11, 95% CI 1.22, 7.91) were only observed among patients with preexisting CVD.  Conclusions:   In men with clinically localised prostate cancer who were initially under active surveillance, ADT was associated with a greater risk of heart failure in men without any preexisting CVD. We also found an increased risk of arrhythmia and conduction disorder in men with preexisting CVD. This study provides the basis for identifying high-risk men treated with ADT who might benefit from regular cardiac monitoring and lifestyle modification recommendations.""","""['Reina Haque', 'Marianne UlcickasYood', 'Xiaoqing Xu', 'Andrea E Cassidy-Bushrow', 'Huei-Ting Tsai', 'Nancy L Keating', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Arnold L Potosky']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy and depression in men with prostate cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation in men with prostate cancer is associated with an increased rate of bone loss.', 'Total androgen blockade.', 'A randomised, double-blind study comparing the addition of bicalutamide with or without dutasteride to GnRH analogue therapy in men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Potential Molecular Connections.', 'Castration of Male Mice Induces Metabolic Remodeling of the Heart.', 'Conventional androgen deprivation therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in advanced prostate cancer, a nationwide population-based study.', 'Cardio-oncology in Austria: cardiotoxicity and surveillance of anti-cancer therapies : Position paper of the Heart Failure Working Group of the Austrian Society of Cardiology.', 'Risks of metabolic diseases and androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer in a Chinese population: a prospective multi-centre cohort study.']"""

This chemotherapy-induced pain (CIP) affects the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors and hampers the optimal clinical management of chemotherapy in cancer patients. The underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, but changes in levels of cytokines/chemokines may contribute to the pathophysiology of CIP.  Objective:   This retrospective study was aimed at examining whether plasma levels of various cytokines change in prostate cancer patients after chemotherapy treatment and whether such changes (if any) are associated with their pain intensity.  Methods:   Using a Luminex assay, plasma levels of 27 cytokines/chemokines were measured in 78 men: 30 patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received chemotherapy (Docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 intravenously), 29 untreated patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, and 19 healthy controls. Subjective pain was assessed in chemotherapy-treated cancer patients using the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores.  Results:   Chemotherapy-treated patients with pain (NRS ≥ 3) exhibited significantly increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) and chemokines (Eotaxin, VEGF, and IP-10) compared with untreated cancer patients or with patients without pain (NRS = 0). Of the 27 cytokines examined, only IL-6 was positively correlated with pain intensity in the chemotherapy-treated patients with pain.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that the cytokines, particularly IL-6, whose levels were elevated in the chemotherapy-treated patients may be involved in the pathophysiology of CIP, and that they might be potential new targets for pain control in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.""","""['Sarah Al-Mazidi', 'Karim Farhat', 'TaoufiK Nedjadi', 'Adeel Chaudhary', 'Osman Zin Al-Abdin', 'Danny Rabah', 'Mohammad Al-Zoghaibi', 'Laiche Djouhri']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pain Med""","""['Erratum.', 'Changes in plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines in response to paclitaxel chemotherapy.', 'IL-7, IL-18, MCP-1, MIP1-β, and OPG as biomarkers for pain treatment response in patients with cancer.', 'IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines are associated with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels among patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate at the Uganda Cancer Institute.', 'Chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.', 'Associations between treatments, comorbidities and multidimensional aspects of quality of life among patients with advanced cancer in the Netherlands-a 2017-2020 multicentre cross-sectional study.', 'On the Road to Accurate Protein Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis: Current Status and Future Advances.', 'Emerging Molecular Targets for the Management of Cancer Pain.', 'A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17-epidermal growth factor receptor signaling contributes to oral cancer pain.', 'The relationship between pain, analgesics and survival in patients with advanced cancer; a secondary data analysis of the international European palliative care Cancer symptom study.']"""

Positive likelihood ratios for RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24 were calculated as 2.99, 4.21, and 2.56 respectively, indicating that the overexpression of the protein is correlated with the presence of disease. Triple-labelled, quantitative, immunofluorescence (with RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24) showed significant changes (p<0.01) in the global intersection coefficient, a measure of how often two fluorophore signals intersect, for RPS19 and RPS24 only.

However, significant heterogeneity remains for those with unfavorable-risk disease.  Methods:   This study included 3335 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy in the SEARCH database. High-risk patients were dichotomized into standard and very high-risk (VHR) groups based on primary Gleason pattern, percentage of positive biopsy cores (PPBC), number of NCCN high-risk factors, and stage T3b-T4 disease. Similarly, intermediate-risk prostate cancer was separated into favorable and unfavorable groups based on primary Gleason pattern, PPBC, and number of NCCN intermediate-risk factors.  Results:   Median follow-up was 78 months. Patients with VHR prostate cancer had significantly worse PSA relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS, P < 0.001), distant metastasis (DM, P = 0.004), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM, P = 0.015) in comparison to standard high-risk (SHR) patients in multivariable analyses. By contrast, there was no significant difference in PSA-RFS, DM, or PCSM between SHR and unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) patients. Therefore, we propose a novel risk stratification system: Group 1 (low-risk), Group 2 (favorable intermediate-risk), Group 3 (UIR and SHR), and Group 4 (VHR). The c-index of this new grouping was 0.683 for PSA-RFS and 0.800 for metastases, compared to NCCN-risk groups which yield 0.666 for PSA-RFS and 0.764 for metastases.  Conclusions:   Patients classified as VHR have markedly increased rates of PSA relapse, DM, and PCSM in comparison to SHR patients, whereas UIR and SHR patients have similar prognosis. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed for patients with VHR, likely involving multimodality therapy.""","""['Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Zinan Chen', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Unification of favourable intermediate-, unfavourable intermediate-, and very high-risk stratification criteria for prostate cancer.', 'Number of Unfavorable Intermediate-Risk Factors Predicts Pathologic Upstaging and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality Following Radical Prostatectomy: Results From the SEARCH Database.', 'Improved decision making in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: a multicenter study on pathologic and oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Statins and prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Predicting the probability of pT3 or higher pathological stage at radical prostatectomy: COVID19-specific considerations.']"""

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we attempted to investigate the downstream targets of lincRNA-p21 in prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Expression of lincRNA-p21 and PKM2 was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Lentivirus expressing shPKM2 or shCtrl was used to explore the role of PKM2 on the enhanced cell proliferation and glycolysis of lincRNA-p21-silenced prostate cancer cells. A xenograft mouse model was performed to investigate the effect of PKM2 suppression, glycolytic or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor on the tumorigenic capacity of lincRNA-p21-silenced prostate cancer cells.  Results:   We revealed that lincRNA-p21 silencing in DU145 and LNCaP cells induced up-regulation of PKM2 and activation of glycolysis, which could be reversed by PKM2 knockdown or rapamycin treatment. We also found that the proliferation and tumorigenesis of lincRNA-p21-silenced prostate cancer cells were significantly inhibited after knocking down PKM2. 3-bromopyruvate (3-Brpa) or rapamycin treatment largely decreased the tumour burden. Importantly, PKM2 expression was inversely correlated with the lincRNA-p21 level and the survival of prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that lincRNA-p21 blunted the prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic capacity through down-regulation of PKM2.

We were investigating the potential association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/haplotypes in proinflammatory (TNF A) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines locus with the development of PCa in Indian population.  Materials and methods:   We had genotyped 235 BPH/PCa samples (130 BPH and 105 cancer) along with 115 control samples for proinflammatory (TNF A -238G/A and -308G/A) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 -1082A/G, -819C/T and -592C/A) cytokines SNPs in the gene promoter region using ARMS-PCR method.  Results:   Allelic frequencies of TNF A and IL-10 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer and BPH when compared to controls (p = 0.05). Further haplotypic analysis showed that two haplotypes of TNF A (AG and AA) and IL-10 gene (CCG and CTG) were serving as risk haplotypes for prostate cancer development. IL-10 risk haplotypes were found to be positively associated with aggressiveness of prostate cancer. We also noticed successively increasing percentage of TNF A and IL-10 risk haplotypes with life style habits like smoking (10 and 26%) and alcohol consuming (9 and 27%).  Conclusions:   According to our data, TNF A -238G>A and IL-10 -1082A>G, -819C>T and -592C>A may be associated with the development of prostate cancer and BPH. We could also notice higher frequency of TNF A and IL-10 risk haplotypes in smoker and alcohol user. Interestingly, IL-10 risk haplotype was positively associated with aggressiveness of tumor.

Moreover, combining the 16p13.3 gain status with standard prognostic markers improved BCR risk stratification and identified a subgroup of patients with high probability of recurrence. The 16p13.3 gain status was also associated with an increased risk of developing distant metastases (log-rank P = 0.03) further substantiating its role in prostate cancer progression.Implications: This study demonstrates the prognostic significance of the 16p13.3 genomic gain in primary prostate tumors, suggesting potential utility in the clinical management of the disease by identifying patients at high risk of recurrence who may benefit from adjuvant therapies.

However, the basis for its overexpression and its growth-inhibitory effects are mitigated and uncertain. Here, we report that PACE4 pre-mRNA undergoes DNA methylation-sensitive alternative splicing of its terminal exon 3' untranslated region, generating an oncogenic, C-terminally modified isoform (PACE4-altCT). We found this isoform to be strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells, where it displayed an enhanced autoactivating process and a distinct intracellular routing that prevented its extracellular secretion. Together, these events led to a dramatic increase in processing of the progrowth differentiation factor pro-GDF15 as the first PACE4 substrate to be identified in prostate cancer. We detected robust expression of PACE4-altCT in other cancer types, suggesting that an oncogenic switch for this proenzyme may offer a therapeutic target not only in advanced prostate cancer but perhaps also more broadly in human cancer.

Methods:   We included men with localized PCa treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of escalated dose (≥74 Gy in 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions) between 1992 and 2013 at an NCI-designated cancer centre. Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy were excluded. The non-treatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the number of non-treatment days divided by the total elapsed days of therapy. NTDR was analysed for each National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group.  Results:   There were 1728 men included (839 low-risk, 776 intermediate-risk and 113 high-risk), with a median follow up of 53.5 months (range 12-185.8). The median NTDR was 31% (range 23-71%), translating to approximately 2 breaks (each break represents a missed treatment that will be made up) for 8 weeks of RT with 5 treatments per week. The 75 percentile of NTDR was 33%, translating to approximately 4 breaks, which was used as the cutoff for analysis. There were no significant differences in freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from distant metastasis, cancer specific survival, or overall survival for men with NTDR ≥33% compared to NTDR<33% for each risk group. Multivariable analyses including NTDR, age, race, Gleason score, T stage, and PSA were performed using the proportional hazards regression procedure. NTDR≥33% was not significantly associated with increased hazard ratio for outcomes in each risk group compared to NTDR<33%.

The 22Rv1 human prostatic carcinoma cell line was originally derived from the parental CWR22R cell line. Although 22Rv1 has been well characterized and used in numerous mechanistic studies, no racial identifier has ever been disclosed for this cell line. In accordance with the need for racial diversity in cancer biospecimens and recent guidelines by the NIH on authentication of key biological resources, we sought to determine the ancestry of 22RV1 and authenticate previously reported racial identifications for four other PCa cell lines.  Methods:   We used 29 established Ancestry Informative Marker (AIM) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to conduct DNA ancestry analysis and assign ancestral proportions to a panel of five PCa cell lines that included 22Rv1, PC3, DU145, MDA-PCa-2b, and RC-77T/E.  Results:   We found that 22Rv1 carries mixed genetic ancestry. The main ancestry proportions for this cell line were 0.41 West African (AFR) and 0.42 European (EUR). In addition, we verified the previously reported racial identifications for PC3 (0.73 EUR), DU145 (0.63 EUR), MDA-PCa-2b (0.73 AFR), and RC-77T/E (0.74 AFR) cell lines.  Conclusions:   Considering the mortality disparities associated with PCa, which disproportionately affect African American men, there remains a burden on the scientific community to diversify the availability of biospecimens, including cell lines, for mechanistic studies on potential biological mediators of these disparities. This study is beneficial by identifying another PCa cell line that carries substantial AFR ancestry.

We aimed to identify predictors of adverse pathology results for low risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy and determine whether a threshold number of positive cores could help the decision process for active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   A total of 3,359 men with low risk prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2000 and August 2016. We analyzed the relationship between biopsy core features and adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy, defined as Grade Group 3 or greater, seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node involvement.  Results:   Of the 171 cases (5.1%) with adverse pathology findings at radical prostatectomy 144 (4.3%) were upgraded to Grade Group 3 or greater, 31 (0.9%) had seminal vesicle invasion and 15 (0.4%) had lymph node involvement. Prostate specific antigen and patient age were the only predictors of adverse pathology results. There was no significant association with the number of positive cores, the total mm of cancer or the maximum percent of cancer in any core. When we expanded the definition of adverse pathology to include Grade Group 2 and extraprostatic extension, the association between core features and outcome was statistically significant but clinically weak, and with no evidence of threshold effects.

This study provides a detailed analysis of the characterization and clinical evaluation of the new detector array.  Material and methods:   The verification of the MatriXXFFF was subdivided into (i) physical dosimetric tests including dose linearity, dose rate dependency and output factor measurements and (ii) patient specific IMRT pre-treatment plan verifications. The MatriXXFFF measurements were compared to the calculated dose distribution of a commissioned treatment planning system by gamma index and dose difference evaluations for 18 IMRT-sequences. All IMRT-sequences were measured with original gantry angles and with collapsing all beams to 0° gantry angle to exclude the influence of the detector's angle dependency.  Results:   The MatriXXFFF was found to be linear and dose rate independent for all investigated modalities (deviations ≤0.6%). Furthermore, the output measurements of the MatriXXFFF were in very good agreement to reference measurements (deviations ≤1.8%). For the clinical evaluation an average pixel passing rate for γ(3%,3mm) of (98.5±1.5)% was achieved when applying a gantry angle correction.

Methods and materials:   This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from men treated in the British Columbia Cancer Agency brachytherapy program from 1998 to 2012. Men were categorized by risk group and ADT use. Cardiac and other comorbidities were recorded and compared between groups. Biochemical control (Phoenix definition, nadir + 2 ng/mL) was ascertained. Overall, prostate, cardiac, and other-cause mortality were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Fine and Gray competing-risk analysis.  Results:   The study included 3155 men (1142 with LR cancer and 2013 with IR cancer) who have been followed up for a median of 7.9 years. ADT was received by 47% of IR patients and 37% of LR patients for a median of 6 months. Men with IR cancer were older and had more cardiac and other comorbidities than LR cases (P<.01). Biochemical control improved from 86% to 89% at 10 years with the use of ADT (P=.006). Overall survival was inferior in patients receiving ADT (84% vs 86% at 10 years, P=.0274), and on competing-risk analysis, cardiovascular mortality in patients receiving ADT was higher in IR cases, 5.2% versus 3.6% at 10 years (P=.0493), but not in LR cases. Multivariate analysis confirmed increased cardiac mortality in IR patients receiving ADT (hazard ratio, 1.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.34]; P=.014).  Conclusions:   ADT adds little meaningful benefit in terms of biochemical control for IR men treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy but likely decreases overall survival because of increased cardiac mortality. IR patients were older and had more cardiac risk factors than LR prostate cases; this may be because of a screening effect, case selection, or common etiologic cause.""","""['Tom Pickles', 'Scott Tyldesley', 'Jeremy Hamm', 'Sean A Virani', 'W James Morris', 'Mira Keyes']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Excellent results from high dose rate brachytherapy and external beam for prostate cancer are not improved by androgen deprivation.', 'High-intermediate prostate cancer treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer and the risk of cardiovascular mortality.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'Cardiovascular events associated with androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Overexpression of IGFBP5 Enhances Radiosensitivity Through PI3K-AKT Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Potential Risk of Other-Cause Mortality Due to Long-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Elderly Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy-A Confirmation Study.', 'Low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Endogenous p53 coprecipitated with EAF2 in prostate cancer cells, and deletion mutagenesis indicated that this interaction was mediated through the C terminus of EAF2 and the DNA binding domain of p53. Concurrent knockdown of p53 and EAF2 induced an increase in proliferation and migration in cultured prostate cancer cells, and conventional p53 and EAF2 knockout mice developed prostate cancer.

Combination of CQDs with g-C3N4 promoted the photoexcited electron/hole separation and largely increased the photocurrents of the nanoheterostructures. Initially, a sandwich-type immunoreaction was carried out on monoclonal anti-PSA antibody-coated microplate by using PSA aptamer linked with CuNCs as the tracer. Accompanying the immunocomplex, the carried CuNCs were dissolved under acidic conditions. The as-released copper ions from the CuNCs could be captured onto the CQDs/g-C3N4 nanoheterostructures via the amino-group on the CQD surface as well as the -NHx (x = 1, 2, 3) of g-C3N4 nanosheets. The strong coordination of the Lewis basic sites on the CQDs/g-C3N4 with Cu2+ decreased the photocurrent of the nanoheterostructures. Under optimal conditions, CQDs/g-C3N4 nanoheterostructures displayed good photocurrent responses for the detection of PSA within the dynamic linear range of 0.02-100 ng mL-1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.0 pg mL-1. This method was also evaluated for quantitative screening of human PSA serum specimens by using the referenced electrochemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunoassay (ECL-ELIA) and gave good matched results between two methods.

However, the mechanism of the occurrence, the progression, and the metastasis of prostate cancer are still unclear. Searching for the effective molecule target is of great significance to improve the curative effect on prostate cancer. Zinc finger E box binding protein-1 (ZEB1) protein is a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family that participates in the embryonic development and formation. ZEB1 was found to be involved in the occurrence and in the development of multiple cancers, while its role in prostate cancer still needs elucidation.  Materials and methods:   Normal prostate cell line PC-3M and prostate cancer cell line DU145 were cultured in vitro and transfected by ZEB1 siRNA. ZEB1 mRNA and protein expressions were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot assay. Cell proliferation was determined by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell migration was evaluated by transwell assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity. The impact of ZEB1 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway was assessed by Western blot assay.  Results:   ZEB1 expression significantly increased in DU145 cells compared with PC-3M cells (p<0.05). ZEB1 mRNA and protein obviously declined, cell proliferation inhibited, cell invasion suppressed, and Caspase-3 activity enhanced in DU145 cells after ZEB1 siRNA transfection (p<0.05).

Methods:   Patients with mCRPC were selected from MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases between 1 January 2009 and 31 July 2012. Prevalence of seizure risk factors were described separately and in combination with other risk factors. Seizure incidence was calculated overall and for each risk factor group.  Results:   The most common risk factors were history of seizure threshold-lowering medication use (35%), history of loss of consciousness (6%), history of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident (2%), treated brain metastasis (0.9%), history of seizure (0.6%), and dementia (0.5%). Overall, seizure incidence was 1.8 per 100 person-years (PYs) (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-2.1), being higher among patients with at least one risk factor (2.8 per 100 PYs; 95% CI 2.2-3.4) than those without risk factors (1.2 per 100 PYs; 95% CI 1.0-1.6). Seizure incidence was highest among a few patients (0.6%) with a history of seizure (82.0 per 100 PYs; 95% CI 45.9-135.2) and within this small subpopulation, higher among those with a history of anticonvulsant use (120.9 per 100 PYs; 95% CI 60.3-216.3) than without anticonvulsant use (43.5 per 100 PYs; 95% CI 11.9-111.3).  Conclusion:   History of seizure is an important risk factor for seizure occurrence in patients with mCRPC, particularly in those with a history of anticonvulsant use.

We previously found differential expression of CXXC5 transcripts in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines of both rat and human origin. However, knowledge on the expression of this gene in benign or malignant human prostate tissue is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the mRNA and protein expression pattern of CXXC5 in human benign prostate tissue, proliferative inflammatory atrophy, high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer, using qPCR, chromogenic in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that protein levels determined by immunohistochemistry were in agreement with transcript levels observed by chromogenic in situ hybridization. CXXC5 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly higher in prostate cancer, high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia, and proliferative inflammatory atrophy, compared to benign prostate tissue. Significantly, within the same tissue specimens, CXXC5 staining was stronger in malignant acini than in matched adjacent, benign acini; immunostaining for this protein was mainly localized to the nucleus of benign epithelial cells and both the nucleus and cytoplasm of malignant epithelial cells.

Furthermore, a common TSPYL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3828743 (G/A) (Pro62Ser), abolishes TSPYL1's ability to suppress CYP3A4 expression, resulting in reduced abiraterone concentrations and increased cell proliferation. Data from a prospective clinical trial of 87 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate/prednisone showed that the variant SNP genotype (A) was significantly associated with worse response and progression-free survival.

Pelvic radiotherapy produces both acute and chronic damage and such damage may have a devastating impact on the quality and on the amount of life of the patient.  Objectives:   To evaluate the number of radical cystectomies that have become necessary in the last five years in our department for AC after radiation treatment.  Materials and methods:   From February 2012 to February 2017, 11 patients underwent ""open"" cystectomy for AC. All patients were studied with radiographic examinations and endoscopy prior to surgery. We retrospectively evaluated the type of primitive cancer, the radiation dose administered, the time between radiation treatment and cystectomy. We also studied the related symptoms that required surgery.  Results:   The mean age of patients at the time of cystectomy was 75 years. In six patients (54.4%) radiotherapy was performed for prostate cancer, for rectal cancer in two patients (18.1%), and for endometrial cancer in three patients (27.2%). Total radiant dose was different in different patients depending on the type and localization of cancer. The median time between radiotherapy and cystectomy was 111 months (24-256 months). All patients had symptoms before surgery. Seven patients (63.3%) with gross haematuria were treated with endoscopic clot evacuation and fulguration.

In our study we predicted the burden of cancer in Catalonia from 2015 to 2025.  Methods:   Bayesian age-period-cohort models were used to predict the burden of cancer from 2015 to 2025 using incidence data from the Girona and Tarragona cancer registries and cancer mortality data from the Catalan mortality registry. Using the Bashir-Estève method, we divided the net change in the number of cases between 2015 and 2025 into changes due to population size (S), cancer risk (R) and age (A) distribution.  Results:   By 2025, there will be 21,743 new cancer cases in men (40% aged > 74 years) and 17,268 in women (37% aged > 74 years). More than 40% of the new cases will be diagnosed among population aged 74 and older in prostate, colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreatic and stomach cancers in men, and in colorectal, pancreatic and bladder cancers and leukaemia in women. During 2015-2025, the number of new diagnoses will increase by 5.5% in men (A + R + S = 18.1% - 13.3% + 0.7% = 5.5%) and 11.9% in women (A + R + S = 12.4% - 1.1% + 0.6% = 11.9%). Overall cancer mortality rates will continue to decrease during 2015-2025. Lung cancer will be the most lethal cancer among men (N = 2705) and women (N = 1174).  Conclusions:   The increase in the number of cancer cases in Catalonia from 2015 to 2025 will mostly affect the elderly, prompting the need for increased collaboration between geriatricians and oncologists.""","""['R Clèries', 'A Ameijide', 'R Marcos-Gragera', 'L Pareja', 'M Carulla', 'M-L Vilardell', 'L Esteban', 'M Buxó', 'J-A Espinàs', 'A Puigdefàbregas', 'J Ribes', 'A Izquierdo', 'J Galceran', 'J M Borrás']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Cancer incidence and mortality projections up to 2020 in Catalonia by means of Bayesian models.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Time trends of cancer incidence and mortality in Catalonia during 1993-2007.', 'Cancer burden with ageing population in urban regions in China: projection on cancer registry data from World Health Organization.', 'Using mortality to predict incidence for rare and lethal cancers in very small areas.', 'How heavy is the medical expense burden among the older adults and what are the contributing factors?

Procedures:   Analysis of 152 metastases was performed in six consecutive patients who underwent [18F]NaF PET/CT at baseline and for early monitoring after 3 cycles of radium-223 dichloride. All metastases depicted on whole-body [18F]NaF PET/CT were contoured and CT (density in Hounsfield units, sclerotic, mixed, or lytic appearance) as well as [18F]NaF [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, and lesion volume (V18F-NaF)] patterns were recorded. Tumor response was defined as percentage change in SUVmax and SUVmean between baseline and post-treatment PET. Bone lesions were defined as stable, responsive, or progressive, according to thresholds derived from a recent multicentre test-retest study in [18F]NaF PET/CT. Total [18F]NaF uptake in metastases, defined as MATV × SUVmean, was correlated to uptake of radium-223 on biodistribution scintigraphy performed 7 days after the first cycle of treatment.  Results:   Among metastases, 116 involved the axial skeleton and 36 the appendicular skeleton. Lesions were sclerotic in 126 cases and mixed in 26 cases. No lytic lesion was depicted. ROC analysis showed that SUVmax and SUVmean were better predictors of lesion response than V18F-NaF and density on CT (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.001, respectively). SUVmax and SUVmean were predictors of individual tumor response in separate multivariate models (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). CT pattern (mixed versus sclerotic) and lesion density were independent predictors only when assessing response with delta SUVmax (P = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively). A good correlation between total [18F]NaF uptake within metastases and their relative radium-223 uptake assessed by two observers 7 days after treatment (r = 0.72 and 0.77, P < 0.0001) was found.

Methods:   A total of 104 patients were treated with 351 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) changes after the first cycle of therapy were documented prior to a second cycle. Patients were followed-up for overall survival (OS). Any PSA decline, PSA decline ≥50%, initial PSA, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), visceral metastases and cumulative injected activity were analyzed and evaluated according to OS. Multivariable analysis with parameters with a p-value ≤0.05 in univariate analysis was performed, additionally adjusting for age and presence of visceral metastases.  Results:   A total of 51 patients (49%) died during the observation period. The majority of patients (97%) presented with bone metastases, 77% with lymph node metastases and 32% with visceral metastases. All patients were treated with at least one line of chemotherapy. Either abiraterone or enzalutamide had been given in 100% of the patients. Any PSA decline occurred in 70 (67%) and a PSA decline ≥50% in 34 (33%) of patients after the first cycle. The median OS was 56.0 weeks (95%CI: 50.5-61.5). Initial PSA decline ≥50%, initial LDH, visceral metastases, second line chemotherapy or prior radium-223 did not have an effect on survival, whereas any initial PSA decline, initial ALP <220 U/L and cumulative injected activity ≥18.8 GBq were associated with a longer survival. A step-by-step analysis revealed a PSA decline ≥20.87% as the most noticeable cut-off prognosticating longer survival, which remained an independent prognosticator of improved OS in the multivariate analysis.

Alpha-beta Hydrolase Domain Containing 5 (ABHD5) is a key regulator of intracellular neutral lipids that has been recently identified as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, yet its potential role in PCa has not been investigated. Through mining publicly accessible PCa gene expression datasets, we found that ABHD5 gene expression is markedly decreased in metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) samples. We further demonstrated that RNAi-mediated ABHD5 silencing promotes, whereas ectopic ABHD5 overexpression inhibits, the invasion and proliferation of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we found that ABHD5 knockdown induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition, increasing aerobic glycolysis by upregulating the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 and phosphofrucokinase, while decreasing mitochondrial respiration by downregulating respiratory chain complexes I and III. Interestingly, knockdown of ATGL, the best-known molecular target of ABHD5, impeded the proliferation and invasion, suggesting an ATGL-independent role of ABHD5 in modulating PCa aggressiveness. Collectively, these results provide evidence that ABHD5 acts as a metabolic tumor suppressor in PCa that prevents EMT and the Warburg effect, and indicates that ABHD5 is a potential therapeutic target against mCRPC, the deadly aggressive PCa.""","""['Guohua Chen', 'Guoli Zhou', 'Siddhesh Aras', 'Zhenhui He', 'Stephanie Lucas', 'Izabela Podgorski', 'Wael Skar', 'James G Granneman', 'Jian Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Loss of abhd5 promotes colorectal tumor development and progression by inducing aerobic glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Positive regulation of prostate cancer cell growth by lipid droplet forming and processing enzymes DGAT1 and ABHD5.', 'The ATGL lipase cooperates with ABHD5 to mobilize lipids for hepatitis C virus assembly.', 'Critical roles for α/β hydrolase domain 5 (ABHD5)/comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) at the lipid droplet interface and beyond.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'A FRET sensor for the real-time detection of long chain acyl-CoAs and synthetic ABHD5 ligands.', 'Recent Advances on the Role of ATGL in Cancer.', 'Tumor Cell Glycolysis-At the Crossroad of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Autophagy.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Epigenetics Crosstalk in Prostate Cancer.', 'Structural and functional insights into ABHD5, a ligand-regulated lipase co-activator.']"""

The identification of PCDH8 methylation can be used as a potential predictive biomarker. Prostate cancer patients with high Gleason score are considered as being at high risk for tumor recurrence and progression, and adjuvant therapy is often routinely performed in clinical practice. In the present study, we did not measure the methylation of PCDH8 in these patients. The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of PCDH8 methylation in serum of prostate cancer patients with low Gleason score. MATERIAL AND METHODS PCDH8 methylation in serum samples of 117 patients and 47 controls was checked by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Then, we correlated PCDH8 methylation status with the clinicopathological parameters of prostate cancer patients with low Gleason score and patient outcomes. RESULTS We found that PCDH8 was more frequently methylated in serum samples of patients with prostate cancer than in controls. PCDH8 methylation was correlated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.021), higher level of preoperative PSA (P=0.008), and positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.010). Moreover, patients with PCDH8 methylation had worse biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (P<0.001) than patients without. Independent prognostic factors for worse BCR-free survival of prostate cancer patients with low Gleason score were: PCDH8 methylation in serum (Exp (B)=3.147, 95% CI: 1.152-7.961, P=0.007), clinical stage (Exp (B)=2.53, 95% CI: 1.032-4.763, P=0.025) and lymph node status (Exp (B)=1.476, 95% CI: 1.107-4.572, P=0.042). CONCLUSIONS Our study indicated that PCDH8 methylation in serum occurred frequently in prostate cancer patients and was correlated with risk factors for poor outcome. The methylation of PCDH8 in serum is a potential predictive marker for prostate cancer patients with low Gleason score after surgery.""","""['Ying-Li Lin', 'Yan-Li Li', 'Jian-Guo Ma']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Promoter methylation of protocadherin8 is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of protocadherin 8 (PCDH8) promoter methylation in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'Aberrant methylation of PCDH10 predicts worse biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'The association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(RARβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Construction of DNA methylation-based nomogram for predicting biochemical-recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic factors in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'MicroRNA-124-3p inhibited progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by interaction with PCDH8 and the inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'Do Protocadherins Show Prognostic Value in the Carcinogenesis of Human Malignant Neoplasms?

This study compared the performance of six different active surveillance protocols for prostate cancer in the Chinese population.  Methods:   Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer from January 1998 to December 2012 at a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong were reviewed. Six active surveillance protocols were applied to the cohort. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the probabilities of missing unfavourable pathological outcome. The sensitivity and specificity of each protocol in identifying low-risk disease were compared.  Results:   During the study period, 287 patients were included in the cohort. Depending on different active surveillance protocols used, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, pathological T3 disease, and upgrading of Gleason score were present on final pathology in 3.3%-17.1%, 0%-3.3%, 3.3%-19.1%, and 20.6%-34.5% of the patients, respectively. The University of Toronto protocol had a higher rate of extracapsular extension at 17.1% and pathological T3 disease at 19.1% on final pathology than the more stringent protocols from John Hopkins (3.3% extracapsular extension, P=0.05 and 3.3% pathological T3 disease, P=0.03) and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS; 8.0% pathological T3 disease, P=0.04). The Royal Marsden protocol had a higher rate of upgrading of Gleason score at 34.5% compared with the more stringent protocol of PRIAS at 20.6% (P=0.04). The specificities in identifying localised disease and low-risk histology among different active surveillance protocols were 59%-98% and 58%-94%, respectively. The John Hopkins active surveillance protocol had the highest specificity in both selecting localised disease (98%) and low-risk histology (94%).  Conclusions:   Active surveillance protocols based on prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score alone or including Gleason score of 3+4 may miss high-risk disease and should be used cautiously. The John Hopkins and PRIAS protocols are highly specific in identifying localised disease and low-risk histology.""","""['C F Tsang', 'J Hl Tsu', 'T Ct Lai', 'K W Wong', 'B Sh Ho', 'A Tl Ng', 'W K Ma', 'M K Yiu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hong Kong Med J""","""['Patient selection and pathological outcomes using currently available active surveillance criteria.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'Feasibility for active surveillance in biopsy Gleason 3\xa0+\xa04 prostate cancer: an Australian radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'High mortality risk of prostate cancer patients in Asia and West Africa: A systematic review.', 'Is prostate specific antigen (PSA) density necessary in selecting prostate cancer patients for active surveillance and what should be the cutoff in the Asian population?']"""

The nonprostatic expression of PSMA has been reported exclusively within the neovasculature endothelial cells of nonprostatic cancers; however, there are few reports on PSMA expression in epithelial cells. Herein, we describe PSMA expression in nonprostatic epithelial cells and characterize the potential of PSMA-binding agents to noninvasively detect that expression. Methods: PSMA expression data were extracted from publicly available genomic databases. Genomic data were experimentally validated for PSMA expression-by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and Western blotting-in several nonprostatic cell lines and xenografts of melanoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) origin. The feasibility of PSMA detection in those tumor models was further established using PSMA-based nuclear and optical imaging agents and by biodistribution, blocking, and ex vivo molecular characterization studies. Results: We discovered that a small percentage of nonprostatic cancer cell lines and tumors express PSMA. Importantly, PSMA expression was sufficiently high to image established melanoma and SCLC xenografts using PSMA-based nuclear and optical imaging agents. Conclusion: These results indicate that PSMA expression in nonprostatic tumors may not be limited to the endothelium but may also include solid tumor tissue of nonprostatic cancers including melanoma and SCLC.

STMN1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, motility, and tumor metastasis. Here, it was found that the expression of STMN1 RNA and protein is elevated in metastatic prostate cancers. Knockdown of STMN1 resulted in reduced proliferation and invasion of cells and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo Furthermore, miR-34a downregulated STMN1 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. Overexpression of miR-34a in prostate cancer cells reduced proliferation and colony formation, suggesting that it is a tumor suppressor. The transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) negatively regulated expression of miR-34a. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of STMN1-modulated prostate cancer cells revealed molecular alterations, including elevated expression of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is involved in cancer progression and potentially in STMN1-mediated oncogenesis. Thus, in prostate cancer, CtBP1-regulated miR-34a modulates STMN1 expression and is involved in cancer progression through the CtBP1\miR-34a\STMN1\GDF15 axis.Implications: The CtBP1\miR-34a\STMN1\GDF15 axis is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of aggressive prostate cancer.

An alternative pathway is to perform multi-parametricMRI (MPMRI) to localise cancer and to use this information to influence the decision for, and conduct of, a subsequent biopsy, known as an MPMRI-targeted biopsy. An MPMRI pathway has been shown to detect a similar or greater amount of clinically significant cancer as TRUS biopsy but has several advantages, including the potential to biopsy fewer men with fewer cores.  Methods:   This is a pragmatic, international, multicentre, parallel group randomised study in which men are allocated in a 1:1 ratio to an MPMRI or TRUS biopsy pathway. This study will assess whether an MPMRI-targeted biopsy approach is non-inferior to a standard TRUS biopsy approach in the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer.Men in the MRI arm will undergo targeted biopsy of suspicious areas only and no biopsy will be carried out if the MRI is non-suspicious. Men in the TRUS biopsy will undergo a standard 10-12-core TRUS biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are a serum PSA ≤20 ng/mL, a digital rectal examination finding of T2 or less and no prior prostate biopsy.The primary outcome is the proportion of men with clinically significant cancer detected. A sample size of at least 470 patients is required. Key secondary outcomes include the proportion of clinically insignificant cancer detected.

In low-risk cancer, active surveillance is the option that best preserves patients' sexual function, but it is unknown if patient preference affects treatment selection. Our objectives were to identify patient characteristics associated with a strong preference to preserve sexual function and to determine whether patient preference and baseline sexual function level are associated with receipt of active surveillance in low-risk cancer.  Methods:   In this population-based cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, baseline patient-reported sexual function was assessed using a validated instrument. Patients were also asked whether preservation of sexual function was very, somewhat, or not important. Prostate cancer disease characteristics and treatments received were abstracted from medical records. A modified Poisson regression model with robust standard errors was used to compute adjusted risk ratio (aRR) estimates. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Among 1194 men, 52.6% indicated a strong preference for preserving sexual function. Older men were less likely to have a strong preference (aRR = 0.98 per year, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97 to 0.99), while men with normal sexual function were more likely (vs poor function, aRR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.39 to 1.82). Among 568 men with low-risk cancer, there was no clear association between baseline sexual function or strong preference to preserve function with receipt of active surveillance. However, strong preference may differnetially impact those with intermediate baseline function vs poor function (Pinteraction = .02).  Conclusions:   Treatment choice may not always align with patients' preferences. These findings demonstrate opportunities to improve delivery of patient-centered care in early prostate cancer.""","""['James R Broughman', 'Ramsankar Basak', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Bryce B Reeve', 'Deborah S Usinger', 'Kiayni C Spearman', 'Paul A Godley', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Patient-reported functional outcome measures and treatment choice for prostate cancer.', 'Surgical Tolerability and Frailty in Elderly Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.', 'Patient-reported sexual quality of life after different types of radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy: Analysis of a population-based prospective cohort.', 'Psychometric Evaluation of PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction Measures in a Longitudinal Population-Based Cohort of Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Clinicopathological parameters currently fail to identify patients prone to systemic relapse and those whom treatment intensification may be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to independently validate the performance of a 70-gene Metastatic Assay in a cohort of diagnostic biopsies from patients treated with radical radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy.  Patients and methods:   A bridging cohort of prostate cancer diagnostic biopsy specimens was profiled to enable optimization of the Metastatic Assay threshold before further independent clinical validation in a cohort of diagnostic biopsies from patients treated with radical radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess assay performance in predicting biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results:   Gene expression analysis was carried out in 248 patients from the independent validation cohort and the Metastatic Assay applied. Ten-year MFS was 72% for Metastatic Assay positive patients and 94% for Metastatic Assay negative patients [HR = 3.21 (1.35-7.67); P = 0.003]. On multivariable analysis the Metastatic Assay remained predictive for development of distant metastases [HR = 2.71 (1.11-6.63); P = 0.030]. The assay retained independent prognostic performance for MFS when assessed with the Cancer of the Prostate Assessment Score (CAPRA) [HR = 3.23 (1.22-8.59); P = 0.019] whilst CAPRA itself was not significant [HR = 1.88, (0.52-6.77); P = 0.332]. A high concordance [100% (61.5-100)] for the assay result was noted between two separate foci taken from 11 tumours, whilst Gleason score had low concordance.  Conclusions:   The Metastatic Assay demonstrated significant prognostic performance in patients treated with radical radiotherapy both alone and independent of standard clinical and pathological variables. The Metastatic Assay could have clinical utility when deciding upon treatment intensification in high-risk patients.

Because ADC tumour cell targets do not have to be drivers of tumour growth, ADCs are potentially relevant for a wide range of tumours currently lacking clear oncogenic drivers. Therefore, we aimed to define the landscape of ADC targets in a broad range of tumours.  Materials and methods:   PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for ADCs that are or were evaluated in clinical trials. Gene expression profiles of 18 055 patient-derived tumour samples representing 60 tumour (sub)types and 3520 healthy tissue samples were collected from the public domain. Next, we applied Functional Genomic mRNA-profiling to predict per tumour type the overexpression rate at the protein level of ADC targets with healthy tissue samples as a reference.  Results:   We identified 87 ADCs directed against 59 unique targets. A predicted overexpression rate of ≥ 10% of samples for multiple ADC targets was observed for high-incidence tumour types like breast cancer (n = 31 with n = 23 in triple negative breast cancer), colorectal cancer (n = 18), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 18), squamous cell lung cancer (n = 16) and prostate cancer (n = 5). In rare tumour types we observed, amongst others, a predicted overexpression rate of 55% of samples for CD22 and 55% for ENPP3 in adrenocortical carcinomas, 81% for CD74 and 81% for FGFR3 in osteosarcomas, and 95% for c-MET in uveal melanomas.  Conclusion:   This study provides a data-driven prioritization of clinically available ADCs directed against 59 unique targets across 60 tumour (sub)types. This comprehensive ADC target landscape can guide clinicians and drug developers which ADC is of potential interest for further evaluation in which tumour (sub)type.""","""['K L Moek', 'D J A de Groot', 'E G E de Vries', 'R S N Fehrmann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Data-Driven prioritisation of antibody-drug conjugate targets in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Antibody drug conjugates: the future of chemotherapy?', 'Prospects and progress of antibody-drug conjugates in solid tumor therapies.', 'Antibody-drug conjugates as novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics.', 'Antibody drug conjugates - Trojan horses in the war on cancer.', 'Osteosarcoma: Current Concepts and Evolutions in Management Principles.', 'Treatment-related adverse events associated with HER2-Targeted antibody-drug conjugates in clinical trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Payload diversification: a key step in the development of antibody-drug conjugates.', 'TCR mimic compounds for pHLA targeting with high potency modalities in oncology.', 'The Potential of Topoisomerase Inhibitor-Based Antibody-Drug Conjugates.']"""

Since adjuvant RT typically occurs daily over several weeks, the logistical challenges of extensive traveling may be a significant barrier to its use. We examined the association between distance to treatment facility and use of adjuvant RT.  Materials and methods:   We identified 97,568 patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed from 2004 through 2011 with cT1-4N0-xM0-x prostate cancer and found to have high-risk pathologic features (pT3-4 stage and/or positive surgical margins) at RP. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic and clinicopathologic factors was used to examine the association between travel distance and receipt of adjuvant RT, defined as radiotherapy initiated within 12 months after RP.  Results:   Overall, 10.6% (10,346) of the study cohort received adjuvant RT. On multivariable analysis, increasing travel distance was significantly associated with decreased use of adjuvant RT, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.0 (reference), 0.67, 0.46, 0.39, and 0.32 (all P<0.001) and prevalence of use at 12.6%, 8.8%, 6.3%, 4.9%, and 3.7% for patients living ≤25.0, 25.1 to 50.0, 50.1 to 75.0, 75.1 to 100.0, and >100.0 miles away, respectively.  Conclusions:   Increasing travel distance was strongly associated with decreased use of adjuvant RT in this national cohort of postprostatectomy patients with high-risk pathologic features. These results strongly suggest that the logistical challenges of extensive travel are a significant barrier to the use of adjuvant RT.

Materials and methods:   The study included 56 patients with prostate cancer undergoing 3-T MRI including DWI (b = 50 and 1000 s/mm2) before radical prostatectomy. Histologic findings from prostatectomy specimens were reviewed to denote each patient's dominant tumor and a benign region with visually decreased ADC. Three readers independently measured the ADCs of both areas using an ROI placed on a single slice through the lesion (2D) and an ROI encompassing all slices through the lesion (3D). Readers repeated measurements after 3 weeks. Assessment included Bland-Altman analysis (coefficient of repeatability [CR] in which lower values indicated higher reliability) and ROC analysis.  Results:   For intrareader variability, the CRs across readers for all ROIs were 9.9% for 2D and 9.3% for 3D. For tumor ROIs the CRs were 10.6% for 2D and 9.6% for 3D. For interreader variability, the CRs across readers for all ROIs were 17.1% for 2D and 20.5% for 3D and for tumor ROIs were 17.9% for 2D and 22.2% for 3D. For combined reader data, the AUCs for benign and malignant findings were 0.77 for 2D and 0.78 for 3D (p = 0.146). For differentiating Gleason score (GS) 3 + 3 from GS > 3 + 3 tumors, the AUCs were 0.92 for 2D and 0.92 for 3D ROIs (p = 0.649). For differentiating GS ≤ 3 + 4 from GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors, the AUCs were 0.70 for 2D and 0.67 for 3D ROIs (p = 0.004).

Therefore, a registration between MR and CT images could improve the overall treatment planning process, by improving visualization with a demonstrated interobserver delineation variability when segmenting the prostate, which in turn can lead to a more precise planning. This registration must compensate for prostate deformations caused by changes in size and form between the acquisitions of both modalities.  Methods:   We present a fully automatic MRI/CT nonrigid registration method for prostate radiotherapy treatment planning. The proposed registration methodology is a two-step registration process involving both a rigid and a nonrigid registration step. The registration is constrained to volumes of interest in order to improve robustness and computational efficiency. The method is based on the maximization of the mutual information in combination with a deformation field parameterized by cubic B-Splines.  Results:   The proposed method was validated on eight clinical patient datasets. Quantitative evaluation, using Hausdorff distance between prostate volumes in both images, indicated that the overall registration errors is 1.6 ± 0.2 mm, with a maximum error of less than 2.3 mm, for all patient datasets considered in this study.

Mechanically-skinned muscle fibres were exposed to a sequence of heavily Ca2+ -buffered solutions at progressively higher free [Ca2+ ] to determine their force-Ca2+ relationship. Ca2+ -sensitivity was decreased in both type I and type II muscle fibres of ADT subjects relative to Controls (by -0.05 and -0.04 pCa units, respectively, P < .02), and specific force was around 13% lower in type I fibres of ADT subjects than in Controls (P = .02), whereas there was no significant difference in type II fibres. Treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol slightly increased specific force in type I and type II fibres of ADT subjects (by ~2%-3%, P < .05) but not in Controls. Pure type IIx fibres were found frequently in muscle from ADT subjects but not in Controls, and the overall percentage of myosin heavy chain IIx in muscle samples was 2.5 times higher in ADT subjects (P < .01).

Men with high SES have higher incidence and lower mortality of PCa versus lower SES males. PCa cases diagnosed in Finland in 1985-2014 (N = 95,076) were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on education level (EL) was obtained from Statistics Finland. EL was assessed with three-tiered scale: basic, upper secondary and higher education. PCa stage at diagnosis was defined as localized, metastatic or unknown. Years of diagnosis 1985-1994 were defined as pre-PSA period and thereafter as post-PSA period. We report PCa-specific survival (PCSS) and relative risks (RR) for PCa specific mortality (PCSM) among cancer cases in Finland, where healthcare is 100% publicly reimbursed and inequality in healthcare services low. Men with higher EL had markedly better 10-year PCSS: 68 versus 63% in 1985-1994 and 90 versus 85% in 1995-2004 compared to basic EL in localized PCa. The RR for PCSM among men with localized PCa and higher EL compared to basic EL was 0.76(95%confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.88) in 1985-1994 and 0.61(95%CI 0.53-0.70) in 1995-2004. Variation in PCSS and PCSM between EL categories was evident in metastatic PCa, too. The difference in PCSM between EL categories was larger in the first 10-year post-PSA period than before that but decreased thereafter in localized PCa, suggesting PSA testing became earlier popular among men with high EL. In summary, higher SES/EL benefit PCa survival both in local and disseminated disease and the effect of EL was more pronounced in early post-PSA period.""","""['Heikki A Seikkula', 'Antti J Kaipia', 'Heidi Ryynänen', 'Karri Seppä', 'Janne M Pitkäniemi', 'Nea K Malila', 'Peter J Boström']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Stage-specific mortality and survival trends of prostate cancer patients in Finland before and after introduction of PSA.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'The U Shape of Prostate-specific Antigen and Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality in High-grade Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'How education level affects postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up: a single-center experience.', 'Influencing factors for mortality in prostate cancer patients with T1 and T2 stage: a retrospective cohort study.', 'An analysis of time trends in breast and prostate cancer mortality rates in Lithuania, 1986-2020.', 'Prognostic values of the core components of the mammalian circadian clock in prostate cancer.', 'Development of an autophagy-related gene expression signature for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Materials & methods:   We retrospectively studied 124 patients with recurrent an/or metastatic PCA who underwent [68Ga]PSMAHBED-CC PET/CT. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was determined in the prostate bed as well as in three size categories (≤ 5 mm, > 5-15 mm, > 15 mm) in pelvic lymph node, extrapelvic lymph node, bone and visceral metastases.  Results:   Significant positive correlations between lesion size and SUVmax were found in pelvic lymph node metastases > 5 -≤15 mm (Spearmans rho = 0.502, p = 0.002) as well as in extrapelvic lymph node metastases5 mm (rho = 0.314, p = 0.033) and > 5 ≤-15 mm (rho = 0.614, p < 0.001). SUVmax tended to be higher in the largest diameter category in each anatomic station than in the middle and lower categories. We were unable to find evidence for a relationship between SUVmax and PSA, PSAdt, Gleason score, androgen deprivation therapy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy status.  Conclusion:   Measured tracer uptake in [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT in patients with recurrent/metastasized prostate cancer is significantly influenced by lesion size as a result of partial volume effects in the very small lesions. Clinical indicators of aggressive prostate cancer behaviour such as PSA levels, PSA doubling time or the Gleason score of the primary tumour, as well as the androgen deprivation therapy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy status are not related to measured tracer uptake.

Although bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-phosphonates (BS) is generally advised for staging by guidelines in high risk prostate cancer, this imaging technique is hampered by a high rate of inconclusive results and moderate accuracy. Potentially better imaging techniques for detection of bone metastases such as 18F-sodiumfluoride PET/CT (NaF PET/CT) are therefore being evaluated. In this observational cohort study we evaluate the performance and clinical impact of both BS and NaF PET/CT in primary staging of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   The first of two cohorts consisted of patients who received a BS while the second included patients who received a NaF PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer. For both cohorts the number of positive, negative and equivocal findings, calculated diagnostic performance of the imaging modality in terms of sensitivity and specificity, as well as the impact on clinical management were studied. The ranges of the diagnostic performance were calculated both assuming that equivocal findings were positive and assuming that they were negative for bone metastases. For the NaF PET/CT cohort the number of patients with signs of lymph node metastases on low dose CT were also recorded, including the impact of these findings on clinical management.  Results:   One-hundred-and-four patients underwent NaF PET/CT, whereas 122 patients underwent BS. Sensitivities of 97-100 and 84-95% and specificities of 98-100 and 72-100% were found on a patient basis for detection of bone metastases with NaF PET/CT and BS, respectively. Equivocal findings warranted further diagnostic procedures in 2% of the patients in the NaF cohort and in 16% in the BS cohort. In addition NaF PET/CT demonstrated lymph node metastases in 50% of the included patients, of which 25% showed evidence of lymph node metastases only.  Conclusion:   Our data indicate better diagnostic performance of NaF PET/CT compared to BS for detection of bone metastases in primary staging of prostate cancer patients. Less equivocal findings are encountered with NaF PET/CT. Moreover, NaF PET/CT has additional value over BS since lymph node metastases are encountered frequently.""","""['Maurits Wondergem', 'Friso M van der Zant', 'Remco J J Knol', 'Anne Marij G Burgers', 'Siebe D Bos', 'Igle J de Jong', 'Jan Pruim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective evaluation of planar bone scintigraphy, SPECT, SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF PET/CT and whole body 1.5T MRI, including DWI, for the detection of bone metastases in high risk breast and prostate cancer patients: SKELETA clinical trial.', 'A Prospective Study Comparing 99mTc-Hydroxyethylene-Diphosphonate Planar Bone Scintigraphy and Whole-Body SPECT/CT with 18F-Fluoride PET/CT and 18F-Fluoride PET/MRI for Diagnosing Bone Metastases.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Difficulties in Defining Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Implications for Clinical Trial Accrual and Community Practice Adoption of Metastasis-Directed Therapy Approaches.', '18F Sodium Fluoride Dose Reduction Enabled by Digital Photon Counting PET/CT for Evaluation of Osteoblastic Activity.', 'Comparison of PET/CT and MRI in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastasis in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Network Analysis of Diagnostic Studies.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Denosumab Reduces Lesional Fluoride Skeletal Burden on Na18FF PET-CT in Patients With Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome.']"""

Therefore, our goal is to present results from a single institutional experience of four patients who underwent whole gland MRI-guided cryoablation with a history complicated by prior abdominoperineal resection.  Materials and methods:   Four MRI-guided cryoablative treatments (mean age 64, range 59-69 years) for primary and locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed in patients with prior abdominal perineal resection for colorectal cancer (3) and juvenile polyposis (1). Average prostate volume prior to ablation was 23 cc, with an average PSA of 5.6 ng/mL. For each gland, 7-10 cryoprobes were placed approximately 0.5 cm apart in the prostate gland under MRI guidance by a transperineal approach with 3-4 freeze-thaw cycles performed. Each patient had follow up imaging and PSA measurements out to 12 months post ablation.  Results:   All four patient's PSA dropped below 0.1 ng/mL at 3-6 month post-ablation and remained at these levels at 12 months. Three of the 4 patients had PSA measurements to 33 months post-ablation, with no evidence of recurrence. No patient developed urinary incontinence due to the whole gland cryoablation.  Conclusion:   With all four patients in our study having undetectable PSAs 12 months post ablation, and with no patient developing urinary incontinence due to the cryoablation, MRI-guided cryoablation appears to be a promising treatment option in patients who are poor surgical candidates due to prior pelvic surgery and/or radiation.""","""['Kristin A Kinsman', 'Mariah L White', 'Lance A Mynderse', 'Akira Kawashima', 'Karen Rampton', 'Krzysztof R Gorny', 'Thomas D Atwell', 'Joel P Felmlee', 'Matthew R Callstrom', 'David A Woodrum']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-guided cryoablation of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: initial single institution experience.', 'Single center experience with third-generation cryosurgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of short-term outcomes, complications, and patient quality of life.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation of prostate cancer: initial experience.', 'From whole-gland to targeted cryoablation for the treatment of unilateral or focal prostate cancer.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'MR Imaging in Real Time Guiding of Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', '""Prostate management"" under MRI-guidance: 7 years of improvements.', 'Influence of a continuous nursing model based on network cloud platforms for urinary control, urination function and quality of life of patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'In situ terahertz monitoring of an ice ball formation during tissue cryosurgery: a feasibility test.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided prostate cancer cryoablation technical updates and literature review.']"""

However, its function in thyroid cancer has not been well documented. Therefore, the present study investigated the function of TCTN1 in thyroid cancer using a loss-of-function assay. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was applied to downregulate TCTN1 in the thyroid cancer cell lines, CAL62 and 8305C. A series of functional properties, including cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined using MTT, colony formation assay and flow cytometry analyses, respectively. The results demonstrated that lentivirus-medicated RNAi could specifically suppress the expression of TCTN1 at the mRNA and protein levels in CAL62, and 8305C cells. Knockdown of TCTN1 inhibited cell growth and proliferation via inducing S phase arrest, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, the S phase arrest was accompanied by the upregulation of cyclin dependent kinase 2, cyclin A2 and downregulation of cyclin B1. Knockdown of TCTN1 induced apoptosis through increasing the expression of Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death, cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and decreasing apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 expression. The current study highlights the essential role of TCTN1 in promoting thyroid cancer cell proliferation, and its knockdown may serve as a potential therapeutic treatment for thyroid cancer.""","""['Peipei Xu', 'Xiaotian Xia', 'Zhili Yang', 'Yuan Tian', 'Jianzhong Di', 'Minggao Guo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['Knockdown of TCTN1 Strongly Decreases Growth of Human Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Tectonic 1 Is a Key Regulator of Cell Proliferation in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Tectonic 1 accelerates gastric cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in vitro.', 'Lentivirus-Mediated knockdown of tectonic family member 1 inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation.', 'Lentivirus-Mediated Knockdown of TCTN1 Inhibits Glioma Cell Proliferation.', 'Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'Life-Saver or Undertaker: The Relationship between Primary Cilia and Cell Death in Vertebrate Embryonic Development.', 'Simvastatin Attenuated Tumor Growth in Different Pancreatic Tumor Animal Models.', 'Function and transcriptional regulation of TCTN1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'MiR-216a-5p targets TCTN1 to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   We evaluated the association between three different management strategies and survival in prostate cancer with LNM after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed data of 1338 patients with LNM after RP from three tertiary care centers. Three hundred and eighty-seven patients (28%) were observed, 676 (49%) received lifelong adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and 325 (23%) received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and ADT. Three hundred and sixty-eight men were followed for more than 10 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and other-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to visualize OS for the three treatment groups. Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized to compare OS and CSS among the three groups.  Results and limitations:   ADT+EBRT was associated with better OS than ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.66, p<0.0001) or observation (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.64, p<0.0001). Higher-risk patients benefited more from ADT+EBRT than lower-risk patients. Ten-year mortality risk difference between ADT+EBRT, observation, or ADT alone ranged from 5% in low-risk patients to 40% in high-risk patients. Adjuvant ADT+EBRT was also associated with better CSS than observation or ADT alone (p<0.0001), ADT had better CSS compared to observation (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.95, p=0.027). However, ADT was associated with an increased risk of other-cause mortality (HR: 3.05, 95% CI: 1.45-6.40, p=0.003) compared with observation, resulting in similar OS between ADT and observation (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.65-1.25, p=0.5). While selection bias might remain, its effect would operate in the opposite direction to our findings.  Conclusions:   In men with LNM after RP, ADT+EBRT improved survival over either observation or adjuvant ADT alone. This survival benefit increases with higher-risk disease.  Patient summary:   Lymph node metastasis following radical prostatectomy is associated with poor survival outcomes. However, we found that adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy with external beam radiation therapy improved survival in these patients.""","""['Karim A Touijer', 'Robert Jeffery Karnes', 'Niccolo Passoni', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Melissa Assel', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Nodal Metastases at Radical Prostatectomy: More Aggressive Disease Warrants Consideration of Multimodal Treatment.', 'Re: Karim A.

Experimental studies reported the over expression of mLST8 in human colon and prostate cancers by activation of both mTORC1/2 complexes and subsequent downstream substrates leading to tumor progression. Considering its role, targeting mLST8 protein would be a therapeutic approach against tumor progression in colon and prostate cancers. Hence, using in silico structure based drug design approach, the comparative binding patterns of 1,1'-binapthyl-2,2'diol (BINOL), 1-(2-carboxynaphth-1yl)-2-naphthoic acid (SCF-12) and their analogs in the cavity of mLST8 were explored. ADME and binding energy calculations led to the identification of five compounds with favorable Glide (G) scores and implicated the importance of Asn132 and Gln225 as key binding residues. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy landscape (FEL) approaches helped in elucidating the binding mechanism and suggested the possibility of ligands 1-3 namely, ZINC01765622, ZINC62723702 and ZINC02576980 to be promising antagonists for mLST8.

Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq2, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.""","""['Gabriela A Merino', 'Ana Conesa', 'Elmer A Fernández']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brief Bioinform""","""['Empirical assessment of the impact of sample number and read depth on RNA-Seq analysis workflow performance.', 'Characterization of kinase gene expression and splicing profile in prostate cancer with RNA-Seq data.', 'Identifying differential alternative splicing events from RNA sequencing data using RNASeq-MATS.', 'Opportunities and methods for studying alternative splicing in cancer with RNA-Seq.', 'A survey of best practices for RNA-seq data analysis.', 'Alternative splicing analysis benchmark with DICAST.', 'Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome complexity in blackgram Vigna mungo (L.)

Materials and methods:   Demographics, perioperative and functional outcomes of the 322 patients that underwent RRP (N=99) or RALP (N=223) at our institution from January 2011 through June 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Postoperative incontinence and erectile dysfunction are involved functional outcomes. During the modified procedure, the bladder neck was dissected first as for RALP. After dissection of vas deference and seminal vesicle, the prostate was dissected in an antegrade fashion with bilateral nerve saving. Finally, the urethra was cut at the prostate apex. After a Rocco suture was applied, and then urethrovesical anastomosis was performed with continuous suture as for RALP.  Results:   Perioperative characteristics and complication rates were similar in the RRP and RALP groups except for mean estimated blood loss (p<0.001) and operative time (p<0.001). Incontinence rates at 3 and 12 months after RRP decreased from 67.6% to 10.1 and after RALP decreased from 53.4% to 5.4%. Positive surgical margin rates were non-significantly different in the RRP and RALP groups (30.3% and 37.2%, respectively). Overall postoperative potency rate at 12 months was not significant different in RRP and RALP groups (34.3% and 43.0%).  Conclusions:   RRP reproducing RALP was found to have surgical outcomes comparable to RALP.

Although significant progress has been made in the early detection and treatment of GC over the past decades, the prognosis is still not satisfactory and the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis remain unknown. Long non-coding RNA MIAT has been established as a key player in the regulation of various biological and pathological processes including chronic lymphocytic leukemias, acute myocardial infarction and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. However, the function of MIAT in GC remains largely unknown. The expressions of lncRNA MIAT, miR-29a-3p and HDAC4 mRNA were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA interference approach was used to investigate the cellular functions of MIAT and miR-29a-3p. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry assay were performed to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cell migration and invasion abilities were evaluated by Transwell assays. In the present study, we first confirmed the high expression level of MIAT in GC tissues and cell lines. In addition, knockdown of MIAT suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells in vitro. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that MIAT competitively binds to miR-29a-3p and consequently upregulates the expression of HDAC4, which is a downstream target of miR-29a-3p. In conclusion, the present study highlighted the involvement of the MIAT/miR-29a-3p/HDAC4 axis in the development of GC, which provided potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for GC.""","""['Yanfeng Li', 'Kuan Wang', 'Yuzhe Wei', 'Qiang Yao', 'Qifan Zhang', 'Hongyan Qu', 'Guanyu Zhu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Silencing of long non-coding RNA HCP5 inhibits proliferation, invasion, migration, and promotes apoptosis via regulation of miR-299-3p/SMAD5 axis in gastric cancer cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA MIAT promotes gastric cancer growth and metastasis through regulation of miR-141/DDX5 pathway.', 'Reduced miR-29a-3p expression is linked to the cell proliferation and cell migration in gastric cancer.', 'Myocardial Infarction Associated Transcript (MIAT): Review of its impact in the tumorigenesis.', 'MiR-29a-3p: a\xa0potential biomarker and therapeutic target in\xa0colorectal cancer.', 'Evaluation of the Potential Diagnostic Role of the Lnc-MIAT, miR-29a-3p, and FOXO3a ceRNA Networks as Noninvasive Circulatory Bioindicator in Ductal Carcinoma Breast Cancer.', 'LncRNA MIAT Upregulates NEGR1 by Competing for miR-150-5p as a Competitive Endogenous RNA in SCIRI Rats.', 'MiR-29a-3p inhibits high-grade transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma by targeting Quaking.', 'Histone Deacetylase Functions in Gastric Cancer: Therapeutic Target?', 'LncRNA MIAT Promotes Spinal Cord Injury Recovery in Rats by Regulating RBFOX2-Mediated Alternative Splicing of MCL-1.']"""

Mangosteen fruit rinds contain a high concentration of xanthone, which is a type of polyphenol. One type of xanthone, α-mangostin, has been reported to exert chemopreventive effects against chemically-induced colon cancer through the decrease of c-Myc expression, suppressing tumor growth in a mouse model of mammary cancer. A recent study demonstrated the inhibitive effect of α-mangostin on the growth of prostate cancer. However, it remains unclear whether α-mangostin induces cell death in oral cancer. The present study examined the impact of α-mangostin on human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC). Firstly we analyzed the expression of c-Myc in five HOSCC cell lines. The highest expression level of c-Myc mRNA was observed in SAS cells and the lowest in HSC-4 cells. Therefore, SAS cells were treated with α-mangostin, which was found to exert a weak cytocidal effect. Since α-mangostin has been reported to exert synergistic effects on cancers when combined with anticancer drugs, we attempted to evaluate such synergistic effects of α-mangostin when used with a cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis‑inducing ligand (TRAIL). We found that the combination of α-mangostin with TRAIL induced apoptosis of SAS cells through the mitochondrial pathway via activation of caspase-9 and -3/7, following release of cytochrome c. This apoptosis was induced by S/G2/M-phase arrest. Immunopositivity for c-Myc was observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 16 (40%) of the 40 cases of HOSCC.

Additionally, thymoquinone reversed EMT by increasing E-cadherin expression and decreasing vimentin and Slug expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway may be associated with EMT. Intriguingly, the expression of TGF-β, Smad2 and Smad3 at the mRNA and protein levels was notably reduced upon thymoquinone treatment in prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells. Subsequently, we confirmed that thymoquinone repressed metastasis and EMT of prostate cancer through downregulation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, which may be partially reversed by TGF-β overexpression. In summary, our findings demonstrated that thymoquinone suppressed the metastatic phenotype and reversed EMT of prostate cancer cells by negatively regulating the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway.

Several HER3‑targeting therapeutics are currently under clinical evaluation. Non-invasive imaging of HER3 expression could improve patient management. Affibody molecules are small engineered scaffold proteins demonstrating superior properties as targeting probes for molecular imaging compared with monoclonal antibodies. Feasibility of in vivo HER3 imaging using affibody molecules has been previously demonstrated. Preclinical studies have shown that the contrast when imaging using anti-HER3 affibody molecules can be improved over time. We aim to develop an agent for PET imaging of HER3 expression using the long-lived positron-emitting radionuclide cobalt-55 (55Co) (T1/2=17.5 h). A long-lived cobalt isotope 57Co was used as a surrogate for 55Co in this study. The anti-HER3 affibody molecule HEHEHE-ZHER3-NOTA was labelled with radiocobalt with high yield, purity and stability. Biodistribution of 57Co-HEHEHE-ZHER3-NOTA was measured in mice bearing DU145 (prostate carcinoma) and LS174T (colorectal carcinoma) xenografts at 3 and 24 h post injection (p.i.). Tumour-to-blood ratios significantly increased between 3 and 24 h p.i. (p<0.05). At 24 h p.i., tumour-to-blood ratios were 6 for DU145 and 8 for LS174T xenografts, respectively. HER3‑expressing xenografts were clearly visualized in a preclinical imaging setting already 3 h p.i., and contrast further improved at 24 h p.i.

Methods:   In 15 patients with localized prostate cancer, an RBI was implanted. A weekly kilovolt cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was acquired to measure the dynamics of RBI volume and prostate-rectum separation. The absolute anorectal volume encompassed by the 2 Gy equieffective 75 Gy isodose (V75Gy) was recalculated as well as the mean anorectal dose. The increase in estimated risk of grade 2-3 late rectal bleeding (LRB) between the start and end of treatment was predicted using nomograms. The observed acute and late toxicities were evaluated.  Results:   A significant shrinkage of RBI volumes was observed, with an average volume of 70.4% of baseline at the end of the treatment. Although the prostate-rectum separation significantly decreased over time, it remained at least 1 cm. No significant increase in V75Gy of the anorectum was observed, except in one patient whose RBI had completely deflated in the third week of treatment. No correlation between mean anorectal dose and balloon deflation was found. The increase in predicted LRB risk was not significant, except in the one patient whose RBI completely deflated. The observed toxicities confirmed these findings.

N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) catalyze co- or posttranslational myristoylation of Src family kinases and other oncogenic proteins, thereby regulating their function. In this study, we provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that inhibiting the N-myristoyltransferase NMT1 suppresses cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and malignant growth of prostate cancer cells. Loss of myristoylation abolished the tumorigenic potential of Src and its synergy with androgen receptor in mediating tumor invasion. We identified the myristoyl-CoA analogue B13 as a small-molecule inhibitor of NMT1 enzymatic activity. B13 exposure blocked Src myristoylation and Src localization to the cytoplasmic membrane, attenuating Src-mediated oncogenic signaling. B13 exerted its anti-invasive and antitumor effects against prostate cancer cells, with minimal toxic side-effects in vivo Structural optimization based on structure-activity relationships enabled the chemical synthesis of LCL204, with enhanced inhibitory potency against NMT1.

We explored the barriers and facilitators to dietary and lifestyle changes and the acceptability of a diet and physical activity intervention in African Caribbean prostate cancer survivors.  Design:   We conducted semistructured in-depth interviews and used thematic analysis to code and group the data.  Participants and setting:   We recruited 14 African Caribbean prostate cancer survivors via letter or at oncology follow-up appointments using purposive and convenience sampling.  Results:   A prostate cancer diagnosis did not trigger dietary and lifestyle changes in most men. This lack of change was underpinned by five themes: precancer diet and lifestyle, evidence, coping with prostate cancer, ageing, and autonomy. Men perceived their diet and lifestyle to be healthy and were uncertain about the therapeutic benefits of these factors on prostate cancer recurrence. They considered a lifestyle intervention as unnecessary because their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was kept under control by the treatments they had received. They believed dietary and lifestyle changes should be self-initiated and motivated, but were willing to make additional changes if they were perceived to be beneficial to health. Nonetheless, some men cited advice from health professionals and social support in coping with prostate cancer as facilitators to positive dietary and lifestyle changes. A prostate cancer diagnosis and ageing also heightened men's awareness of their health, particularly in regards to their body weight.

The National Prostate Cancer Register includes all prostate cancers diagnosed in Sweden. We analysed 4063 cases with stage category pT3a and 1371 cases with pT3b at radical prostatectomy between 2000 and 2012. Associations between pT3a and pT3b and progression were evaluated and adjusted for year, age, biopsy grade and s-PSA. Needle biopsy findings in these stages were compared. Patients with pT3b (n=1371) had a higher risk of death from prostate cancer (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.3, p<0.001) and death from any cause (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, p<0.001) than those with pT3a (n=4063). They were also more likely to be treated with post-operative radiotherapy (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7, p<0.001) or androgen deprivation therapy (HR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5-3.7, p<0.001), indicating clinical progression. Yet, disease-specific survival of patients with stage pT3b was 94% after 6 years. Median cancer extent in pre-operative biopsies of pT3a and pT3b was 14 and 24 mm (p<0.001), number of positive cores was four and five, (p<0.001) and biopsy Gleason score was 8-10 in 11.6% and 27.3%, respectively (p<0.001).

In this study, we investigated dose-averaged LET (LETd) distributions for spot scanning PT of prostate cancer patients using different beam angle configurations. In addition, we derived RBE-weighted (RBEw) dose distributions and related normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) for the rectum and bladder.  Material and methods:   A total of 21 spot scanning proton plans were created for each of six patients using a prescription dose of 78 Gy(RBE1.1), with each plan using two 'mirrored' beams with gantry angles from 110°/250° to 70°/290°, in steps of 2°. Physical dose and LETd distributions were calculated as well as RBEw dose distributions using either RBE = 1.1 or three different variable RBE models. The resulting biological dose distributions were used as input to NTCP models for the rectum and bladder.  Results:   For anterior oblique (AO) configurations, the rectum LETd volume and RBEw dose increased with increasing angles off the lateral opposing axis, with the RBEw rectum dose being higher than for all posterior oblique (PO) configurations. For PO configurations, the corresponding trend was seen for the bladder. Using variable RBE models, the rectum NTCPs were highest for the AO configurations with up to 3% for the 80°/280° configuration while the bladder NTCPs were highest for the PO configurations with up to 32% for the 100°/260°. The rectum D1cm3 constraint was fulfilled for most patients/configurations when using uniform RBE but not for any patient/configuration with variable RBE models.

Safety was assessed by recording the incidence and severity of any adverse events, skeletal complications, and bone pain throughout the intervention.  Results:   There was a significant difference between groups for self-reported physical functioning (3.2 points; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-6.0 points; P = 0.028) and lower body muscle strength (6.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-12.7; P = 0.033) at 3 months favoring EX.

However, their specific functions and mechanisms remained to be further explored. MiR-129 has been reported in gastric cancers, colon cancer and lung cancer. In this study, we disclosed a new tumor suppresser function of miR-129 in prostate cancer. The purpose of our study is to clarify the effects of miR-129 in cellular processes correlated with cancer development and progression of prostate cancer cell by regulating ETS1. MiR-129 and ETS1 expression in prostate cancer tissues, tumor adjacent tissues and cells were tested by quantitative real-time PCR. We validated the target relationship between miR-129 and ETS1 by dual luciferase reporter gene system. MTT, colony formation, tumorigenesis assays, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays were used to analyze cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in vivo and in vitro. The level of ETS1 protein expression was detected by western blot. Here we demonstrate that miR-129 have a relatively reduced expression in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. Morever, the miR-129 inhibits the expression of ETS1 by binding its 3'-UTR. The overexpression of miR-129 can inhibit PC-3 cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion through targeting ETS1 by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings suggested that miR-129 could directly suppress ETS1, which might be one of potential mechanisms in inhibiting cell processes including viability, proliferation, migration and invasiveness of prostate cancercells and it provides new clues for us to understand the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer. In addition, it may help to develop a treatment approach for ETS1-activated prostate cancer.""","""['Song Xu', 'Jingping Ge', 'Zhengyu Zhang', 'Wenquan Zhou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['MiR-1 inhibits prostate cancer PC3 cells proliferation through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by binding to c-Met.', 'Muscleblind-like 1 antisense RNA 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer by sponging miR-181a-5p and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'Circular RNA_0000326 promotes bladder cancer progression via microRNA-338-3p/ETS Proto-Oncogene 1/phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.', 'CircRNA RNA hsa_circ_0008234 Promotes Colon Cancer Progression by Regulating the miR-338-3p/ETS1 Axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling.', 'Melatonin Protects Against Hyperoxia-Induced Apoptosis in Alveolar Epithelial type II\xa0Cells by Activating the MT2/PI3K/AKT/ETS1 Signaling Pathway.', 'ETS1 is a prognostic biomarker of triple-negative breast cancer and promotes the triple-negative breast cancer progression through the YAP signaling.', 'Lysine demethylase 5A promotes prostate adenocarcinoma progression by suppressing microRNA-330-3p expression and activating the COPB2/PI3K/AKT axis in an ETS1-dependent manner.', 'miR-130b suppresses the invasion and migration of prostate cancer via inhibiting DLL1 and regulating the PI3K/Akt pathways.']"""

We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.""","""['Libby Ellis', 'Alison J Canchola', 'David Spiegel', 'Uri Ladabaum', 'Robert Haile', 'Scarlett Lin Gomez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Advancing the Science of Cancer Health Disparities Research.', 'Social class, race/ethnicity, and incidence of breast, cervix, colon, lung, and prostate cancer among Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, 1988-92 (United States).', 'The Effect of Patient and Contextual Characteristics on Racial/Ethnic Disparity in Breast Cancer Mortality.', 'Association between the neighborhood obesogenic environment and colorectal cancer risk in the Multiethnic Cohort.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in breast and gynecologic cancer treatment and outcomes.', 'The influence of socioeconomic disparities on breast cancer tumor biology and prognosis: a review.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Survival Among People With Second Primary Cancer in the US.', 'Characterizing Lung Cancer Burden Among Asian-American Communities in Philadelphia.', 'Frequent upregulation of HER2 protein in hormone-receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer after short-term neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.', 'Cancer-related cognitive impairment in racial and ethnic minority groups: a scoping review.', 'The Effect of Proton Pump Inhibitor Use on Survival of Patients With Colorectal Cancer: A Study of a Racially Diverse Population.']"""

By affixing a targeting probe for the prostate-specific membrane antigen on its surface, the nanopharmaceutical was able to assess the functional state of the androgen receptor pathway via MRI, guiding therapy and delivering it with the same clinical nanoparticle. In order to simultaneously inhibit signaling from key oncogenic pathways of more advanced forms of prostate cancer, a single-agent therapy for early stage disease to inhibit DNA replication, as well as combination therapy with two drugs co-retained within the nanopharmaceutical's polymeric coating, were tested and resulted in complete tumor ablation. Recalcitrant and terminal forms of the disease were effectively treated with a nanopharmaceutical delivering a combination that upregulates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibits metastasis, thereby showing that this multifunctional nanoplatform can be used in the clinic for patient stratification, as well as precision treatment based on the individual's unique disease features.""","""['Charalambos Kaittanis', 'Alexander Bolaender', 'Barney Yoo', 'Nilesh Shah', 'Ouathek Ouerfelli', 'Jan Grimm']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nano Lett""","""['Role of integrated cancer nanomedicine in overcoming drug resistance.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen as a target for cancer imaging and therapy.', 'PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Nanocarrier for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Specific Antitumor Activity of a Self-Immolative Tubulysin Conjugate.', 'Ultrasound-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) facilitates the delivery of A10-3.2 aptamer targeted and siRNA-loaded cationic nanobubbles for therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Dual Immunostimulatory Pathway Agonism through a Synthetic Nanocarrier Triggers Robust Anti-Tumor Immunity in Murine Glioblastoma.', 'Ultrasmall Luminescent Metal Nanoparticles: Surface Engineering Strategies for Biological Targeting and Imaging.', 'Protease-triggered bioresponsive drug delivery for the targeted theranostics of malignancy.', 'MRI-traceable theranostic nanoparticles for targeted cancer treatment.', 'Molecular MR Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To compare the rates of preventive services among PCa survivors five years before and after diagnosis, to men without PCa.  Design:   Men enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Southern California with newly diagnosed PCa (2002-2008) were matched 1:1 to men without a PCa diagnosis on age, race, and timing of prostate-specific antigen test (N = 31,180). The use of preventive services, including colorectal cancer screening, diabetes tests, lipid panels, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations was assessed 5 years before and after diagnosis (or index date for controls).  Main outcome measures:   Relative rates (RRs) of use were calculated for cases and controls separately and compared using Poisson regression, adjusting for comorbidities and outpatient utilization in 2014.  Results:   Overall, the rates of preventive services were lower among men with PCa vs men without PCa. However, in the 5 years after diagnosis, rates of preventive service use for all services were greater among PCa survivors vs men without PCa (colorectal cancer: RR = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.10; lipids: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.08-1.11; hemoglobin A1C: RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.14-1.19; glucose: RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.23-1.26; influenza vaccine: RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03-1.07; pneumococcal vaccine: RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.97-1.09).

Patients who received X-ray therapy and/or brachytherapy were excluded. Of 3210 total enrolled prostate cancer patients, 85 received prostate and pelvic radiation therapy exclusively with PBT. Most had clinically and radiographically negative lymph nodes although 6 had pelvic nodal disease and one also had para-aortic involvement. Pelvic radiation therapy was delivered using either 2 fields (opposed laterals) or 3 fields (opposed laterals and a posterior beam). Median pelvic dose was 46.9 GyE (range 39.7-56) in 25 fractions (range 24-30). Median boost dose to the prostate +/- seminal vesicles was 30 GyE (range 20-41.4) in 16 fractions (range 10-24).

This necessitates an assessment of the physical, psychological/emotional, psycho-social, spiritual and cultural components of the individual's healthcare needs, and accordingly, devising a plan of care to secure the best outcomes. This article concentrates on the psychological/emotional component. It outlines a case study of a patient's response to the consultant's question in the joint consultation clinic, examines the CNS's interpretation and understanding of the events, and her perspective on whether factors such as fear, anxiety and distress influence the individual's response to the diagnosis, their comprehension of information and the messages relayed, and consequently, their ability to manage the ensuing issues.

Beyond basic dimensions and volume calculations, tumor morphometry is an area that has received little attention, as it requires the analysis of the prostate gland and tumor foci in three-dimensions. Previous efforts to generate three-dimensional prostate models have required specialised graphics units and focused on the spatial distribution of tumors for optimisation of biopsy strategies rather than to generate novel morphometric variables such as tumor surface area. Here, we aimed to develop a method of creating three-dimensional models of a prostate's pathological state post radical prostatectomy that allowed the derivation of surface areas and volumes of both prostate and tumors, to assess the method's accuracy to known clinical data, and to perform initial investigation into the utility of morphometric variables in prostate cancer prognostication. Serial histology slides from 21 prostatectomy specimens covering a range of tumor sizes and pathologies were digitised. Computer generated three-dimensional models of tumor and prostate space filling models were reconstructed from these scanned images using Rhinoceros 4.0 spatial reconstruction software. Analysis of three-dimensional modelled prostate volume correlated only moderately with weak concordance to that from the clinical data (r=0.552, θ=0.405), but tumor volume correlated well with strong concordance (r=0.949, θ=0.876). We divided the cohort of 21 patients into those with features of aggressive tumor versus those without and found that larger tumor surface area (32.7 vs 3.4cc, p=0.008) and a lower tumor surface area to volume ratio (4.7 vs 15.4, p=0.008) were associated with aggressive tumor biology.""","""['Marcus C Hovens', 'Kevin Lo', 'Michael Kerger', 'John Pedersen', 'Timothy Nottle', 'Natalie Kurganovs', 'Andrew Ryan', 'Justin S Peters', 'Daniel Moon', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Niall M Corcoran', 'Matthew K H Hong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Relationship between systematic biopsies and histological features of 222 radical prostatectomy specimens: lack of prediction of tumor significance for men with nonpalpable prostate cancer.', 'The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Pathologic aspects of prostate cancer: prediction of malignant potential.', 'Additive Manufacturing of Resected Oral and Oropharyngeal Tissue: A Pilot Study.', 'Three-Dimensional Presentation of Tumor Histopathology: A Model Using Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Nuclear morphometry in indeterminate thyroid nodules.']"""

Custirsen (OGX011) is a second generation highly specific antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the production of clusterin, an antiapoptotic protein that is upregulated in response to chemotherapy and that confers treatment resistance. We aimed to assess whether custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone increases overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel.  Methods:   In this randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial, men with radiographically documented metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment with a Karnofsky performance status of more than 70% and who were fit for chemotherapy, were recruited from 95 cancer treatment centres in eight countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using permuted blocks (block size 8) to receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone (cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days plus oral prednisone 10 mg daily) with or without custirsen (640 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, plus three previous loading doses) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the completion of ten treatment cycles. Randomisation was stratified by use of opioids for prostate cancer-related pain at screening, disease progression following first-line docetaxel treatment established by radiographic evidence, and previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival in all randomly assigned patients and in a poor-prognosis subgroup. All analyses were intention to treat with the exception of safety, which was reported for patients who received any assigned treatment. The trial has been completed and the results presented here are the final analysis. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01578655.  Findings:   Between Sept 9, 2012, and Sept 29, 2014, 795 patients were screened for enrolment. 635 men were eligible for inclusion and were randomly assigned (n=317 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group and n=318 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group). Median follow up was 28·3 months (IQR 24·4-34·5) for the custirsen group and 29·8 months (IQR 25·3-35·2) for the control group. Median overall survival in all randomly assigned patients did not differ between the two groups (14·1 months [95% CI 12·7-15·9] in the curtisen group vs 13·4 months [12·1-14·9] in the control group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·95 [95% CI 0·80-1·12]; log-rank p=0·53). In the poor prognosis subgroup, median overall survival also did not differ between the two treatment groups (11·0 months [95% CI 9·3-13·3] in the custursin group vs 10·9 months [8·2-12·4] in the control group; HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·80-1·21]; two-sided p=0·80). The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the custirsen versus control groups were neutropenia (70 [22%] of 315 vs 61 [20%] of 312), anaemia (68 [22%] vs 49 [16%]), fatigue (23 [7%] vs 18 [6%]), asthenia (16 [5%] vs 8 [3%]), bone pain (16 [5%] vs 5 [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (16 [5%] vs 9 [3%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 155 (49%) versus 132 (42%). 27 patients died within 30 days of treatment in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group, seven of which were deemed to be treatment related, versus 17 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group, eight of which were deemed to be treatment related. Of the 21 deaths reported, 15 were reported as complications related to study treatment, either chemotherapy (eight and three, respectively) or study drug (none and four, respectively).  Interpretation:   We noted no survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with the addition of custirsen to cabazitaxel and prednisone treatment. Cabazitaxel and prednisone remains the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy.

Materials and methods:   One hundred and eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked them to rate the importance of 143 non-technical elements of care and to rate the quality of their own care with respect to each element. The elements that a patient rated as both 'very important' and less than 'very good' were deemed to be his priorities for improvement. The priorities of the population were established by ranking the elements based on the percentage of patients who identified them as a priority (importance/quality analysis).  Results:   The response rate was 65%. The percentage of elements rated 'very good' varied from patient to patient: median 79% (interquartile range 69-92%). The percentage of elements rated either 'very good' or 'good' was higher: median 96% (interquartile range 86-98%). Nonetheless, almost every patient rated at least some elements of his care as less than optimal, regardless of the cut-off point used to define optimal quality. Patients assigned their lowest quality ratings to elements relating to the quality of the treatment environment and comprehensiveness of additional services available to them. However, patients rated most of these elements as relatively unimportant, and importance/quality analysis identified elements of care relating to communication of information about the disease and its treatment as the highest priorities for quality improvement.  Conclusions:   Most patients rated most elements of their personal care as very good, but almost all were able to identify some elements that were less than optimal. When ratings of quality were integrated with ratings of importance, elements relating to communication emerged as the patients' highest priorities for quality improvement.""","""['K A Foley', 'P A Groome', 'D Feldman-Stewart', 'M D Brundage', 'J H Foley', 'S McArdle', 'W J Mackillop']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['What Aspects of Personal Care Are Most Important to Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer?', 'A Delphi study to develop indicators of cancer patient experience for quality improvement.', 'Quality of care experienced by Finnish cancer patients during radiotherapy.', 'A criterion-based audit of the technical quality of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Improving patient experience in primary care: a multimethod programme of research on the measurement and improvement of patient experience.', ""Men's perceptions and preferences regarding prostate cancer radiation therapy: A systematic scoping review.""]"""

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to develop a new aptamer-based biosensor through the self-assembling of thiolated aptamers for PSA and VEGF on the top of gold electrodes. This biosensor was tested in three prostate cell lines (RWPE-1, LNCaP and PC3). The results evidenced a stable and sensitive sensor presenting wide linear detection ranges (0.08-100 ng/mL for PSA and 0.15 ng-100 ng/mL for VEGF). Therefore, the aptasensor was able to detect the patterns of PSA and VEGF released in vitro by PCa cells, which gave new insights about the prostate cancer protein dynamics. Thus, it could be used as a non-invasive PCa clinical diagnosis instrument in the near future. Graphical Abstract Overview of the experimental design applied to the aptamer-based electrochemical sensor self-assembled on the thiolated hairpin structure. A filter membrane was added on top of working electrode to provide the cell-attachment surface after aptamer incubation, without compromising the aptamer layer. The pore membrane allowed target proteins to pass to the aptamer surface; the MCH backfilling avoided unspecific protein binding to the gold electrode surface.""","""['Bruno P Crulhas', 'Agnieszka E Karpik', 'Flávia K Delella', 'Gustavo R Castro', 'Valber A Pedrosa']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['A Sensitive Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Electrochemical Quantification of PSA as a Specific Diagnostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Gold Nanoparticles-MWCNT Based Aptasensor for Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Label-free electrochemical aptasensing of the human prostate-specific antigen using gold nanospears.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'Aptamer-based biosensors and nanosensors for the detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): A review.', 'Aptamers as Theragnostic Tools in Prostate Cancer.', 'Fabrication of Au/Fe3O4/RGO based aptasensor for measurement of miRNA-128, a biomarker for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).', 'Highly Sensitive Electrochemical Aptasensor for Detecting the VEGF165 Tumor Marker with PANI/CNT Nanocomposites.', 'Design Strategies for Electrochemical Aptasensors for Cancer Diagnostic Devices.', 'From Small Molecules Toward Whole Cells Detection: Application of Electrochemical Aptasensors in Modern Medical Diagnostics.']"""

The recently established 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT has significantly improved the detection rate with published values of up to 55% for patients with a serum PSA concentration between 0.2-0.5 ng/mL. The increased soft tissue contrast in the pelvis using simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI might further improve the detection rate in patients with EBR and low PSA values over PET/CT.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 56 consecutive patients who underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for biochemical recurrence in our institution between April and December 2016 with three readers. Median PSA level was 0.99 ng/mL (interquartile range: 3.1 ng/mL). Detection of PSMA-positive lesions within the prostate fossa, local and distant lymph nodes, bones, or visceral organs was recorded. Agreement among observers was evaluated with Fleiss's kappa (k).  Results:   Overall, in 44 of 56 patients (78.6%) PSMA-positive lesions were detected. In four of nine patients (44.4%) with a PSA < 0.2 ng/mL, suspicious lesions were detected (two pelvic and one paraaortic lymph nodes, and two bone metastases). In eight of 11 patients (72.7%) with a PSA between 0.2 and < 0.5 ng/mL, suspicious lesions were detected (two local recurrences, six lymph nodes, and one bone metastasis). Five out of 20 patients with a PSA < 0.5 ng/mL had extrapelvic disease. In 12 of 15 patients (80.0%) with a PSA between 0.5 and < 2.0 ng/mL, suspicious lesions were detected (four local recurrences, nine lymph nodes, and four bone metastases). In 20 of 21 patients (95.2%) with a PSA >2.0 ng/mL, suspicious lesions were detected. The overall interreader agreement for cancer detection was excellent (κ = 0.796, CI 0.645-0.947).  Conclusions:   Our data show that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI has a high detection rate for recurrent prostate cancer even at very low PSA levels <0.5 ng/mL.

Results:   Of 5,474 Gleason 8 biopsies in men lacking other high progression risk criteria 3,263 (60%) were downgraded, changing the progression risk category from high to intermediate. A higher prevalence of Gleason 8 downgrading was significantly and independently associated with decreasing age, African American race, lower cT category, lower prostate specific antigen quartile and certain combinations of primary and secondary Gleason grades (3 + 5 greater than 4 + 4 greater than 5 + 3). Gleason 8 downgrading in cases of cT less than 3 was independently and significantly associated with a lower prevalence of up staging (prevalence ratio = 0.65, 95% CI 0.61-0.69).

On multivariable analysis, core involvement and PSAD were found to be predictors of upgrading (odds ratio [OR] 1.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.034, P = .039; and OR 3.638, 95% CI 1.084-12.207, P = .001, respectively). Furthermore, core involvement and PSAD were predictors of upstaging (OR 1.020, 95% CI 1.020-1.034, P = .003; and OR 5.656, 95% CI 1.285-24.894, P = .022, respectively). PSAD showed areas under the curve of 0.712 (95% CI 0.645-0.780, P = .000) and 0.628 (95% CI 0.566-0.689, P = .000) for the prediction of upgrading and upstaging, respectively. In a subpopulation of 90 patients theoretically eligible for active surveillance, 14% were found upstaged and 17% were upgraded. PSAD showed areas under the curve of 0.894 (95% CI 0.808-0.97, P = .000) and 0.689 (95% CI 0.539-0.840, P = .021) for the prediction of upgrading and upstaging, respectively.  Conclusion:   PSAD is a valuable predictor of upgrading and upstaging in men with PCa who were candidates for surgery and is accurate in selecting patients for AS.""","""['Aldo Brassetti', 'Riccardo Lombardo', 'Paolo Emiliozzi', 'Antonio Cardi', 'De Vico Antonio', 'Iannello Antonio', 'Scapellato Aldo', 'Riga Tommaso', 'Pansadoro Alberto', ""D'Elia Gianluca""]""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Brassetti et\xa0al.: Prostate-specific Antigen Density Is a Good Predictor of Upstaging and Upgrading, According to the New Grading System: The Keys We Are Seeking May Be Already in Our Pocket (Urology 2018;111:129-136).', 'Prostate-specific antigen vs prostate-specific antigen density as a predictor of upgrading in men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer by contemporary multicore prostate biopsy.', 'Low serum testosterone predicts upgrading and upstaging of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate cancer pathology: What has changed in the last 5 years.', 'Prognostic Value of the Intermediate-risk Feature in Men with Favorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Determination of Whether Apex or Non-Apex Prostate Cancer Is the Best Candidate for the Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density to Predict Pathological Grade Group Upgrading and Upstaging after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Physical Inactivity, Metabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Development of a Predicting Nomogram.', 'A high high-density lipoprotein level is associated with Gleason score upgrade in Chinese patients diagnosed with high-grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Physical activity decreases the risk of cancer reclassification in patients on active surveillance: a multicenter retrospective study.']"""

FUBP1 expression is required for HCC tumor cell expansion, and it functions as an important pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic oncoprotein that binds to the single-stranded DNA sequence FUSE to regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes. In this study, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and discovered that the Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) and its derivative 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active irinotecan metabolite that is used in the clinics in combination with other chemotherapeutics to treat carcinoma, inhibit FUBP1 activity. Both molecules prevent in vitro the binding of FUBP1 to its single-stranded target DNA FUSE, and they induce deregulation of FUBP1 target genes in HCC cells. Our results suggest the interference with the FUBP1/FUSE interaction as a further molecular mechanism that, in addition to the inactivation of TOP1, may contribute to the therapeutic potential of CPT/SN-38.

Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study from January 2009 to April 2013. Men 40 to 65 years old who underwent robot assisted bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy were randomized 1:1 to the control or the treatment group. Participants were exposed to air as the control or to 100% oxygen as the treatment in hyperbaric conditions. The primary outcome was erectile function at 18 months as measured by IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function). Secondary outcomes were 12-month urinary symptoms, and 18-month sexual, urinary, bowel and hormonal related symptoms as measured by EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26). Adverse events and long-term cancer outcomes were monitored. Primary and secondary outcomes in the 2 groups were compared by the independent group t-test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the chi-square test of proportion.  Results:   A total of 109 potent men were randomized to hyperbaric oxygenation therapy or the control group. A total of 43 men in the air group and 40 in the hyperbaric oxygenation therapy group completed the 18-month followup.

Objective:   This study was designed to determine the modalities of ordering total PSA or free PSA assays (in the absence of PCa) according to various parameters and the corresponding sums reimbursed.  Methods:   Men aged 40 years and older covered by the national health insurance general scheme (73% of the French population) between 2012 and 2014 were selected. Data were derived from the Système national d'information inter-régimes de l'assurance maladie (Sniiram) (National health insurance information system) database.  Results:   In 2014, 27% of the 11.6 million men 40 years and older underwent at least one total PSA assay and 5.6% underwent at least one free PSA assay, with marked variations according to the presence or absence of treated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (53% and 15% vs 24% and 5%) and from one administrative department to another. The peak total PSA assay rate was observed between the ages of 65 and 74 years: 64% of men with LUTS, 46% without LUTS. Between 2012 and 2014, men in whom at least one PSA assay had been performed underwent a mean of 1.8 total PSA assays and 1.7 free PSA assays, with means of 2.3 and 2, respectively, in the presence of LUTS. General practice specialists ordered 91% of the PSA tests reimbursed in 2014 (92% for total PSA and 87% for free PSA) and urologists ordered 4% of reimbursed tests. The total sum reimbursed was €28.5 million, comprising €8.7 million for free PSA. An average of 10 laboratory tests was performed at the same time as the PSA assay in the absence of treated LUTS.  Conclusion:   Total PSA and free PSA assays are performed in a large number of men, although the value of these tests as first-line test before biopsy remains controversial.

This work sought to: i) propose an automatic method for urethra segmentation in CT, ii) compare it with previously proposed surrogate models and iii) quantify the dose received by the urethra in patients treated with IMRT.  Materials and methods:   A weighted multi-atlas-based urethra segmentation method was devised from a training data set of 55 CT scans of patients receiving brachytherapy with visible urinary catheters. Leave-one-out cross validation was performed to quantify the error between the urethra segmentation and the catheter ground truth with two scores: the centerlines distance (CLD) and the percentage of centerline within a certain distance from the catheter (PWR). The segmentation method was then applied to a second test data set of 95 prostate cancer patients having received 78Gy IMRT to quantify dose to the urethra.  Results:   Mean CLD was 3.25±1.2mm for the whole urethra and 3.7±1.7mm, 2.52±1.5mm, and 3.01±1.7mm for the top, middle, and bottom thirds, respectively. In average, 53% of the segmented centerlines were within a radius<3.5mm from the centerline ground truth and 83% in a radius<5mm. The proposed method outperformed existing surrogate models. In IMRT, urethra DVH was significantly higher than prostate DVH from V74Gy to V79Gy.

Physicians consistently overestimate functional recovery. We measured concordance between surgeon-assessed and patient-reported outcomes and evaluated a novel method to provide feedback to surgeons.  Materials and methods:   Men treated with radical prostatectomy self-completed the International Index of Erectile Function-6 questionnaire at each postoperative visit. Separately, physicians graded sexual function on a 5-point scale. International Index of Erectile Function -6 score<22 and grade ≥3 defined patient-reported and physician-assessed erectile dysfunction (ED), respectively. Feedback on concordance was given to physicians starting in May 2013 with the implementation of the Amplio feedback system. Chi-square tests were used to assess agreement proportions and linear regression to evaluate changes in agreement after implementation.  Results:   From 2009 to 2015, 3,053 men completed at least 1 postprostatectomy questionnaire and had a concurrent independent physician-reported outcome. Prior to implementation of feedback in 2013, patients and physicians were consistent as to ED 83% of the time; in 10% of cases, physicians overestimated function; in 7% of cases, physicians, but not patients reported ED. Agreement increased after implementation of feedback but this was not statistically significant, likely owing to a ceiling effect. Supporting this hypothesis, increase in agreement postfeedback was greater during late follow-up (≥12mo), where baseline agreement was lower compared to earlier follow-up.  Conclusions:   Agreement was higher than expected at baseline; implementation of feedback regarding discrepancies between patient-reported and physician-assessed outcomes did not further improve agreement significantly.

Method:   Interviews with 19 men aged under 65 were performed 12-18 months after their radical prostatectomy. The interviews were analysed using a thematic content analysis.  Results:   The analysis of the interviews revealed three categories of experiences: 'Paying a price for survival', 'Feeling sidestepped' and 'Living with death lurking around the corner'. The side effects of the prostatectomy, such as sexual dysfunction, resulted in a changed self-image with a loss of manliness and reduced self-esteem. The men felt sidestepped and that they did not receive enough support. Prostate cancer was experienced as an embarrassing disease and the men felt their fundamental needs could not be openly discussed. Having cancer was associated with death. Thoughts about death faded away during recovery after the operation, but grew stronger in certain situations and reminded the men about their cancer. Returning to work and to previous activities helped them cope with the thoughts about death.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests a need for improved rehabilitation after a radical prostatectomy, including more structured sexual rehabilitation, and involving the partner.

Metabolomics presents biological phenotypes at the metabolite level and holds a great potential for cancer classification. Since metabolomic data can be obtained from different samples or analytical techniques, data fusion has been applied to improve classification accuracy. Data preprocessing is an essential step during metabolomic data analysis. Therefore, we developed an innovative optimization method to select a proper data preprocessing strategy for metabolomic data fusion using a design of experiment approach for improving the classification of prostate cancer (PCa) stages. In this study, urine and serum samples were collected from participants at five phases of PCa and analyzed using a 1H NMR-based metabolomic approach. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used as a classification model and its performance was assessed by goodness of fit (R2) and predictive ability (Q2). Results show that data preprocessing significantly affect classification performance and depends on data properties. Using the fused metabolomic data from urine and serum, PLS-DA model with the optimal data preprocessing (R2 = 0.729, Q2 = 0.504, P < 0.0001) can effectively improve model performance and achieve a better classification result for PCa stages as compared with that without data preprocessing (R2 = 0.139, Q2 = 0.006, P = 0.450). Therefore, we propose that metabolomic data fusion integrated with an optimal data preprocessing strategy can significantly improve the classification of cancer stages for precision treatment.""","""['Hong Zheng', 'Aimin Cai', 'Qi Zhou', 'Pengtao Xu', 'Liangcai Zhao', 'Chen Li', 'Baijun Dong', 'Hongchang Gao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', '1H NMR and multi-technique data fusion as metabolomic tool for the classification of golden rums by multivariate statistical analysis.', 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with a distinct urinary metabolomic signature.', 'A novel metabolomic data scaling method based on K-L divergence.', 'A tutorial review: Metabolomics and partial least squares-discriminant analysis--a marriage of convenience or a shotgun wedding.', 'Adaptive Data Fusion Method of Multisensors Based on LSTM-GWFA Hybrid Model for Tracking Dynamic Targets.', 'Identification of characteristic metabolic panels for different stages of prostate cancer by 1H NMR-based metabolomics analysis.', 'Potential of nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics in the study of prostate cancer.', 'The Differential Metabolic Profiles Between Deltamethrin-Resistant and -Susceptible Strains of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) by 1H-NMR.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prospectively collected data of men who underwent 2S and 4D low dose rate brachytherapy in a single institution were analysed. Survival estimates were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test. Treatment failure rates were further compared by Cox proportional hazards (Coxph) regression or by a surrogate prostate-specific antigen value cut-off of 0.4 ng/ml 48 months post-implant. Treatment toxicity outcomes were also evaluated. Comparative costs were based on published English National Health Service data.  Results:   We compared outcomes of 690 men treated with 2S and 1031 men with 4D brachytherapy. Median follow-up times were 10.4 and 5.2 years (P < 0.001) for 2S and 4D cases, respectively. Day 0 post-implant dosimetry was improved in 4D brachytherapy patients. Five years post-implant ≥98% of cases were alive and ≥95% were free from disease relapse irrespective of technique. Coxph regression showed the risk of relapse after 4D brachytherapy was similar to the 2S technique (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-1.03, P = 0.065). Forty-eight months post-implant there was a significantly greater proportion of 4D brachytherapy cases with a prostate-specific antigen below 0.4 ng/ml relative to the 2S technique. Urinary and bowel symptom scores showed reduced toxicity after 4D implants and potency conservation was similar to the 2S technique. The reduction in time and resource use decreased the cost of 4D brachytherapy by 40% compared with the 2S technique.  Conclusion:   Two-stage and 4D brachytherapy are both highly effective for the control of localised prostate cancer. However, relative to the 2S technique, the 4D technique was associated with improved dosimetry, reduced treatment-related toxicity and reduced cost. Further follow-up will assess disease control superiority of 4D brachytherapy beyond 5 years post-implant.""","""['S E M Langley', 'J Uribe', 'S Uribe-Lewis', 'J Money-Kyrle', 'C Perna', 'S Khaksar', 'R Soares', 'R Laing']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Hemi-ablative low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy for unilateral localised prostate cancer.', '4D Brachytherapy, a novel real-time prostate brachytherapy technique using stranded and loose seeds.', 'A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy with or without supplemental external beam radiotherapy as practiced in Japan: outcomes of 1300 patients.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Besides neurons, tau is expressed in human breast, prostate, gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers where it shows nearly similar structure and exerts similar functions as the neuronal tau. The amount of tau and its phosphorylation can change its function as a stabilizer of microtubules, and lead to the development of paired helical filaments in different neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Determining the phosphorylation state of tau and its microtubule-binding characteristics is important. In addition, examining the intracellular localization of tau is important in different diseases. This manuscript details standard protocols for measuring tau phosphorylation and tau binding to microtubules in colorectal cancer cells with or without curcumin and LiCl treatment. These treatments can be used to stop cancer cell proliferation and development. Intracellular localization of tau is examined by using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy while using low amounts of antibodies. These assays can be used repetitively for screening compounds that affect tau hyperphosphorylation or microtubule binding.

Methods:   Using a 20% Medicare sample, the authors identified men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from 2010 through 2013. Rates of treatment, potential overtreatment (ie, treatment in men with a ≥75% chance of 10-year mortality from competing risks), and Medicare payments were measured using regression models. The impact of ACO participation was assessed using difference-in-differences analyses.  Results:   Before implementation of ACOs, the treatment rate was 71.8% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 70.2%-73.3%) for ACO-aligned beneficiaries and 72.3% (95% CI, 71.7%-73.0% [P = .51]) for non-ACO-aligned beneficiaries. After implementation, this rate declined to 68.4% (95% CI, 66.1%-70.7% [P = .017]) for ACO-aligned beneficiaries and 69.3% (95% CI, 68.5%-70.1% [P<.001]) for non-ACO-aligned beneficiaries.

We aim to provide a method for which centre and site-specific population range uncertainty due to inter-fraction motion can be quantified to improve the uncertainty model in proton treatment planning. Daily volumetric MVCT data from previously treated radiotherapy patients has been used to investigate inter-fraction changes to water equivalent path-length (WEPL). Daily image-guidance scans were carried out for each patient and corrected for changes in CTV position (using rigid transformations). An effective depth algorithm was used to determine residual range changes, after corrections had been applied, throughout the treatment by comparing WEPL within the CTV at each fraction for several beam angles. As a proof of principle this method was used to quantify uncertainties for inter-fraction range changes for a sample of head and neck patients of [Formula: see text] mm, [Formula: see text] mm and overall [Formula: see text] mm. For prostate [Formula: see text] mm, [Formula: see text] mm and overall [Formula: see text] mm. The choice of beam angle for head and neck did not affect the inter-fraction range error significantly; however this was not the same for prostate. Greater range changes were seen using a lateral beam compared to an anterior beam for prostate due to relative motion of the prostate and femoral heads. A method has been developed to quantify population range changes due to inter-fraction motion that can be adapted for the clinic. The results of this work highlight the importance of robust planning and analysis in proton therapy. Such information could be used in robust optimisation algorithms or treatment plan robustness analysis.

The prostate cancer specialist nurse was perceived as the hub of survivorship care. Members of the interprofessional team perceived benefit in the nurse-led multimodal supportive care intervention. .  Interpretation:   An emphasis needs to be placed on personalizing care, with supportive care interventions targeted to individual needs. .  Implications for nursing:   Care can be improved by incorporating holistic needs assessment to target specialized interventions for optimized, individualized care plans. An intervention seminar encouraged self-management and self-efficiency, leading to greater satisfaction for participants.""","""['Charlotte Primeau', 'Catherine Paterson', 'Ghulam Nabi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Nurs Forum""","""['A pilot randomised controlled trial of a multimodal supportive care (ThriverCare) intervention for managing unmet supportive care needs in men with metastatic prostate cancer on hormonal treatment and their partner/caregivers.', 'Unmet Supportive Care Needs of Men With Locally Advanced and Metastatic Prostate Cancer on Hormonal Treatment: A Mixed Methods Study.', 'Working patterns and perceived contribution of prostate cancer clinical nurse specialists: a mixed method investigation.', 'Identifying the unmet supportive care needs of men living with and beyond prostate cancer: A systematic review.', ""Prostate cancer and supportive care: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of men's experiences and unmet needs."", 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Intervention en soins de soutien auprès de survivants du cancer prostatique avancé : Revue intégrative de la littérature.', 'Supportive care interventions and quality of life in advanced disease prostate cancer survivors: An integrative review of the literature.', 'Using the Framework Method for the Analysis of Qualitative Dyadic Data in Health Research.', 'Predictive model of psychological distress in family caregivers of patients with cancer: a cross-sectional study.']"""

This study aimed to assess the associations of late rectal disorder (LRD) with dosimetric, anatomic, and clinical factors in patients with prostate cancer who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT).  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 104 patients undergoing 3D-CRT between January 2009 and October 2011. Thirty patients were administered anticoagulation/antiplatelet (AC/AP) agents. The standard dose was 74 Gy. Uni- and multi-variate analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of LRD after 3D-CRT.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 66 (range: 14-87) months. LRD occurred in 10.6% (11/104) of patients. The median time from RT to LRD was 15 months (range: 7-41 months). Sixty-four percent of those with LRD (7/11 patients) had been given AC/AP agents. Fifty-five (6/11) patients had severe internal iliac artery calcification. By univariate analysis, significant predictors of LRD were internal iliac artery calcification, administration of AC/AP agents, and age. Being very elderly was the significant predictor identified by multivariate analysis (P = 0.0276). For patients receiving AC/AP agents and those with severe internal iliac artery calcification, the LRD incidences were 23.3% (7/30 patients) and 23.1% (6/26 patients), respectively, and being 75 years of age or older was a significant predictor in these subsets.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest advanced age, administration of AC/AP agents, and severe internal iliac artery calcification to be risk factors for LRD in patients undergoing standard RT. Therefore, it is necessary to administer radiation with particular caution in the very elderly, especially those receiving AC/AP agents and/or with severe internal iliac artery calcification.""","""['Toshiya Maebayashi', 'Naoya Ishibashi', 'Takuya Aizawa', 'Masakuni Sakaguchi', 'Hideki Sato', 'Katsuhiko Sato', 'Tsuyoshi Matsui', 'Kenya Yamaguchi', 'Satoru Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Short-course, intensity-modulated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of mean rectal dose on late rectal bleeding after conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: dose-volume effect.', 'Comparison of late rectal toxicity from conventional versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Patient-related risk factors for late rectal bleeding after hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a single-center retrospective study.', 'Evaluation of mixed energy partial arcs for volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

In this current study, antiproliferative activity of [L(BF2)2] as a novel binuclear boron-fluoride complex was examined to preliminary research in eight different cell lines, HELA, DU-145, PC3, DLD-1, ECC-1, PNT1-A, HT-29, and MCF-7, it was found to have a potent, suppressive effect on human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line ECC-1. Based on this data, later investigated its apoptotic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic properties on human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line ECC-1 in different concentrations. Apoptotic and cytotoxic tests such as single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay), DNA fragmentation laddering, acridine orange test for DNA damage, and ELISA for apoptotic measurement was performed. We also gauged the oxidative status by evaluating total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS). Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated too. As a result [L(BF2)2] has been found to have a marvelous effect on ECC-1 cells, especially in damaging their DNA and cause a series of reactions lead to apoptosis.

Methods:   In a pilot phase we developed a rating tool based on formal and content-related criteria for the assessment of cancer apps. We used this instrument on cancer apps available in the App Store (iOS) concerning breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. The results were stratified according to target group, content and advertising.  Results:   We assessed 41 mobile cancer apps. Six apps (14.63%) scored very high, fifteen apps (36.59%) high, seventeen apps (41.46%) were deficient, and three apps (7.32%) were insufficient. The largest group of apps represents those apps with the ""deficient"" rating. The very good to good apps had reliable sources, a concrete intent/ purpose in their app description, and a strict distinction of scientific content and advertisement. Apps with the predicates ""deficient"" or ""insufficient"" had particularly poor ratings, e.g. in the subscales ""information on sources"" and ""data protection"".  Conclusions:   Almost half of the tested apps were deficient or insufficient. In order to improve safety of patients using apps, some regulation seems mandatory. Putting apps under the legislation for medical products might be one way to better regulate and control quality. Second, efforts should focus on the development of checklists that make it easier for patients to search for suitable cancer apps.""","""['Cathleen Böhme', 'Marc Baron von Osthoff', 'Katrin Frey', 'Jutta Hübner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Development of a Rating Tool for Mobile Cancer Apps: Information Analysis and Formal and Content-Related Evaluation of Selected Cancer Apps.', 'Development and validation of the Italian version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and its generalisability to apps targeting primary prevention.', 'Mobile medical apps for patient education: a graded review of available dermatology apps.', ""mHealth in Urology: A Review of Experts' Involvement in App Development."", 'A systematic review of quality assessment methods for smartphone health apps.', 'Systematic Evaluation of the Behavior Change Techniques and Quality of Commercially Available Cancer Self-Management Apps.', 'Sociodemographic Characteristics Associated With an eHealth System Designed to Reduce Depressive Symptoms Among Patients With Breast or Prostate Cancer: Prospective Study.', 'Evaluation of mobile health applications for cervical cancer in the digital marketplace.', 'Evaluation of Mobile Health Applications to Track Patient-Reported Outcomes for Oncology Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Assessing Apps for Patients with Genitourinary Tumors Using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS): Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis.']"""

Recent work suggests that newly formed nerve fibers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic nerve-derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for angiogenesis. We found that the loss of endothelial Adrb2, the gene encoding the β2-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of Adrb2 and Cox10, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by Adrb2 deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression.

Because androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has immmunostimulatory effects as well as direct antitumor effects, AR-targeted therapies have been combined with other anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. Here, we sought to study whether an antigen-specific mechanism of resistance to ADT (overexpression of the AR) may result in enhanced AR-specific T-cell immune recognition, and whether this might be strategically combined with an antitumor vaccine targeting the AR. Androgen deprivation increased AR expression in human and murine prostate tumor cells in vitro and in vivo The increased expression persisted over time. Increased AR expression was associated with recognition and cytolytic activity by AR-specific T cells. Furthermore, ADT combined with vaccination, specifically a DNA vaccine encoding the ligand-binding domain of the AR, led to improved antitumor responses as measured by tumor volumes and delays in the emergence of castrate-resistant prostate tumors in two murine prostate cancer models (Myc-CaP and prostate-specific PTEN-deficient mice). Together, these data suggest that ADT combined with AR-directed immunotherapy targets a major mechanism of resistance, overexpression of the AR. This combination may be more effective than ADT combined with other immunotherapeutic approaches.

Methods and materials:   Nineteen patients had a planning computed tomography (CT) scan followed by a mean of 11 repeated CT scans during radiation therapy. The prostate, SV, and external and internal iliac LN regions on the left and right were outlined on each CT scan. Systematic and random uncertainties were determined along with correlations between the motions of these regions. The clinical target volume to planning target volume margins required to take only motion into account were calculated for each guidance method.  Results:   For bone guidance, motion of the prostate and LNs was largely uncorrelated. Margins to compensate for motion (left-right, superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, in cm) based on a 3-DOF couch were as follows: prostate (0.2, 0.6, 0.8), SV (0.4, 0.9, 1.0), and LNs (0.3, 0.4, 0.6). For prostate guidance, margins were calculated for correlated motion: prostate (0, 0, 0), SV (0.3, 0.5, 0.4), and LNs (0.3, 0.5, 0.9). For a 6-DOF couch, these margins were as follows: prostate (0.2, 0.6, 0.8), SV (0.3, 0.9, 1.0), and LNs (0.3, 0.4, 0.3) for bone guidance. For prostate guidance, margins were as follows: prostate (0, 0, 0), SV (0.2, 0.5, 0.4), and LNs (0.3, 0.6, 0.6).  Conclusions:   Image guided radiation therapy based on bony anatomy requires larger prostate and SV margins, and guidance on prostate requires larger LN margins.

Methods:   National Health Interview Surveys from 2005 to 2015 were analyzed in 2017 to estimate routine prostate-specific antigen testing in the past year from self-reported data by age group (40-54, 55-69, ≥70 years), and also by risk group, defined as African American men or men with a family history of prostate cancer versus other men. Differences between successive survey years by age and risk groups were assessed by predicted margins and rate ratios with 99% CIs, using logistic regressions.  Results:   Prostate-specific antigen testing among men aged 55-69 years decreased from a high of 43.1% (95% CI=40.3, 46.1) in 2008 to a low of 32.8% (95% CI=30.8, 34.7) in 2013, with no significant change in 2015 at 33.8% (95% CI=31.3, 36.4).

Depth-dose curves in beam direction were extracted for both dose distributions in a regular grid and range deviations were determined and correlated to SPR differences within the irradiated volume.  Results:   Absolute (relative) mean water-equivalent range shifts of 1.1mm (1.2%) and 4.1mm (1.7%) were observed in the head-tumor and prostate-cancer cohort, respectively. Due to the case dependency of a generic HLUT, range deviations within treatment fields strongly depend on the tissues traversed leading to a larger variation within one patient than between patients.  Conclusions:   The magnitude of patient-specific range deviations between HLUT and the more accurate DECT-based SPR prediction is clinically relevant. A clinical application of the latter seems feasible as demonstrated in this study using medically approved systems from CT acquisition to treatment planning.""","""['Patrick Wohlfahrt', 'Christian Möhler', 'Kristin Stützer', 'Steffen Greilich', 'Christian Richter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Dual-Energy Computed Tomography to Assess Intra- and Inter-Patient Tissue Variability for Proton Treatment Planning of Patients With Brain Tumor.', 'Refinement of the Hounsfield look-up table by retrospective application of patient-specific direct proton stopping-power prediction from dual-energy CT.', 'Evaluation of Stopping-Power Prediction by Dual- and Single-Energy Computed Tomography in an Anthropomorphic Ground-Truth Phantom.', 'Dual- and multi-energy CT for particle stopping-power estimation: current state, challenges and potential.', 'Proton radiography and tomography with application to proton therapy.', 'An evaluation of the use of DirectSPR images for proton planning in the RayStation treatment planning software.', 'Proton beam range verification by means of ionoacoustic measurements at clinically relevant doses using a correlation-based evaluation.', 'Potential of a Second-Generation Dual-Layer Spectral CT for Dose Calculation in Particle Therapy Treatment Planning.', 'Evaluation of Stopping Power Ratio Calculation Using Dual-energy Computed Tomography With Fast Kilovoltage Switching for Treatment Planning of Particle Therapy.', 'Dual-layer spectral CT for proton, helium, and carbon ion beam therapy planning of brain tumors.']"""

Our study aimed at investigating the significance of FOXK1 expression in human EC and its biological function in the development of EC. We found that FOXK1 was overexpressed in EC tissues compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry. And high FOXK1 expression was related to poor differentiation of EC. The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that high FOXK1 expression may result in poor prognosis of EC patients. Furthermore, overexpression of FOXK1 in EC9706 cell inhibited cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation and migration, and suppression of FOXK1 in EC109 cell obtained reverse results.

Oxidative metabolites were produced using human liver microsomes (HLMs), and isolated for mass spectral (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. We screened recombinant P450s using MA at 62 μM (HLM Km for metabolite 1; M1) and 28 μM (HLM Km for metabolite 2; M2). UGT isoforms were simultaneously incubated with UDPGA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), CYP3A4 and MA. Metabolites were evaluated for pharmacologic activity on the PR, AR and GR. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are responsible for oxidative metabolism of 62 μM MA. 3. At 28 μM substrate concentration, CYP3A4 was the only contributing enzyme. Mass spectral and NMR data suggest metabolism of MA to two alcohols. After oxidation, MA is converted into two secondary glucuronides by UGT2B17 among other UGTs.

Whether this is true after radiotherapy is unknown.  Objective:   To determine whether the HSD3B1 (1245C) allele predicts worse clinical outcomes from ADT for biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Prostate Clinical Research Information System at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was used to identify the study cohort, which included men treated with ADT for biochemical recurrence after primary radiotherapy between 1996 and 2013. We retrospectively determined HSD3B1 genotype.  Main outcomes and measures:   Time to progression, time to metastasis, and overall survival according to genotype. Demographic and treatment characteristics were evaluated for confounders. Multivariable analyses were performed to adjust for known prognostic factors.  Results:   A total of 218 eligible men were identified, of whom 213 (98%) were successfully genotyped. Of these, 97 of 213 (46%), 96 of 213 (45%) and 20 of 213 (9%) carried 0, 1, and 2 variant alleles. Overall variant allele frequency was 136 of 426 alleles (32%). Median patient age (interquartile range) was 69 (63-74), 72 (65-78), and 69 (65-77) years for 0, 1, and 2 variant alleles (P = .03). Demographic and treatment factors were otherwise similar. During a median follow-up of 7.9 years, median time to progression was 2.3 years (95% CI, 1.6-3.1 years) with 0 variant alleles, 2.3 years (95% CI, 1.5-3.3 years) with 1 variant allele, and 1.4 years (95% CI, 0.7-3.3 years) with 2 variant alleles (P = .68). Median time to metastasis diminished with the number of variant alleles inherited: 7.4 (95% CI, 6.7-9.7), 5.8 (95% CI, 4.9-6.5), and 4.4 (95% CI, 3.0-5.7) years, with inheritance of 0, 1, and 2 variant alleles, respectively (P = .03). Median OS was 7.7 (95% CI, 6.7-10.3), 6.9 (95% CI, 5.8-8.4), and 7.2 (95% CI, 3.8-7.9) years with inheritance of 0, 1, and 2 variant alleles, respectively (P = .31). On multivariable analysis with 0 variant alleles as the reference, the adjusted hazard ratio for metastasis was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.74-1.92) (P = .48) for 1 variant allele and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.02-3.97) (P = .045) for 2 variant alleles. Multivariable analysis did not demonstrate significant differences in TTP or OS.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, the HSD3B1 (1245C) allele was associated with more rapid development of metastases in men treated with ADT for biochemical recurrence after primary radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

Objective:   To determine whether the HSD3B1 (1245C) genotype is predictive of clinical response to extragonadal androgen ablation with nonsteroidal 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) inhibition in men with metastatic CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   An observational study of men with metastatic CRPC treated with ketoconazole between June 1998 and December 2012 was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco.  Exposures:   Extragonadal androgen ablation with the nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor ketoconazole among men with metastatic CRPC.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end points of analysis were duration of ketoconazole therapy and time to disease progression stratified by HSD3B1 genotype. Disease progression was defined as either biochemical or radiographic progression, using the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 definitions, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate time on therapy and time to disease progression. A log-rank test for trend was used to compare outcomes by HSD3B1 genotype.  Results:   A total of 90 men (median [interquartile range] age, 61.5 [55.3-67.0] years) with metastatic CRPC were included in the analysis, with sufficient data to determine duration of ketoconazole therapy and time to disease progression in 88 and 81 patients, respectively. The median duration of therapy increased with the number of inherited HSD3B1 (1245C) variant alleles: 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.4-10.4) for 0 variant alleles; 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.9-19.2) for 1; and 12.3 months (95% CI, 1.8-not reached) for 2 (overall comparison for trend, P = .01). Median progression-free survival also increased with number of HSD3B1 (1245C) variant alleles inherited: 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.5) for 0 variant alleles; 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.6-32.9) for 1; and 15.2 months (95% CI, 7.8-not reached) for 2 (overall comparison for trend, P = .03).  Conclusions and relevance:   Inheritance of the HSD3B1 (1245C) variant allele, which is a predictive biomarker of resistance to castration, is also a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to extragonadal androgen ablation with a nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor.

STIM1 inhibition suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a variety of cancer models both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of STIM1 in prostate carcinogenesis, in particular, in tumor migration and invasion is unclear.

We found that migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells were significantly inhibited after the suppression of STIM1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was inactivated by STIM1 knockdown. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 synergized with STIM1 knockdown to inhibit cell motility.

In the present study, the effect and mechanism of CPT analogs in LAPC4 cells were investigated. LAPC-4 cells were treated with NSC, CPT, and topotecan. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) subcellular activation were measured at different doses and time-points, with or without PKCδ inhibition or knockdown of PKCδ expression. NSC at doses ranging from 10 to 100 nM induced a dose-dependent increase in viable cell number and DNA biosynthesis with mild cell apoptosis, whereas, at doses ranging from 500 nM to 5 mM, NSC produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and DNA biosynthesis with a significant induction of cell apoptosis. Both NSC-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis were blocked by knockdown of PKCδ with a specific RNAi, or by the co-administration of rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor. Moreover, NSC produced a dose-dependent subcellular activation of PKCδ. The dose-dependent dual action of NSC is mediated at least in part through the differential subcellular activation of PKCδ in LAPC4 cells.

Although the role of HCMV in cancer is still elusive, recent studies revealed the presence of HCMV nucleic acids and proteins in different cancer types such as glioblastoma, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, and neuroblastoma. Although HCMV may not be directly associated with the neoplastic transformation, the presence of HCMV DNA in the tumorous tissue has been associated with altered clinical outcomes in cancer patients. However, the mechanisms involved in the association between colorectal cancer (CRC) and HCMV are unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of HCMV infection on CRC or their derived cells. Proliferation and migration assays revealed a high infection efficiency in CRC-derived HT29 and SW480 'stem‑like' cells. After 24, 48 and 72 h of HCMV infection, both HT29 and SW480 parental and stem‑like cells showed a signiﬁcant increase in cell proliferation and viability (p<0.0001). Moreover, HCMV infection promoted cell migration. These results demonstrate a significant phenotypic alteration in the CRC cell line upon HCMV infection. Using epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) assays, we demonstrated that the EMT markers and driver genes were upregulated during the virus infection.

We aimed at assessing the impact of a magnetic field on PBS-PT plan quality and robustness. Specifically, the robustness against anatomical changes and positioning errors in an MRI-guided scenario with a 30 cm radius 1.5 T magnetic field was studied for prostate PT. Five prostate cancer patients with three consecutive CT images (CT1-3) were considered. Single-field uniform dose PBS-PT plans were generated on the segmented CT1 with Monte-Carlo-based treatment planning software for inverse optimization. Plans were optimized at 90° gantry angle without B-field (no B), with ±1.5 T B-field (B and minus B), as well as at 81° gantry angle and +1.5 T (B G81). Plans were re-calculated on aligned CT2 and CT3 to study the impact of anatomical changes. Dose distributions were compared in terms of changes in DVH parameters, proton range and gamma-index pass-rates. To assess the impact of positioning errors, DVH parameters were compared for ±5 mm CT1 patient shifts in anterior-posterior (AP) and left-right (LR) direction. Proton beam deflection considerably reduced robustness against inter-fractional changes for the B scenario. Range agreement, gamma-index pass-rates and PTV V95% were significantly lower compared to no B. Improved robustness was obtained for minus B and B G81, the latter showing only minor differences to no B. The magnetic field introduced slight dosimetric changes under LR shifts. The impact of AP shifts was considerably larger, and equivalent for scenarios with and without B-field. Results suggest that robustness equivalent to PT without magnetic field can be achieved by adaptation of the treatment parameters, such as B-field orientation (minus B) with respect to the patient and/or gantry angle (B G81). MRI-guided PT for prostate cancer might thus be implemented without compromising robustness compared to state-of-the-art CT-guided PT.""","""['Christopher Kurz', 'Guillaume Landry', 'Andreas F Resch', 'George Dedes', 'Florian Kamp', 'Ute Ganswindt', 'Claus Belka', 'Bas W Raaymakers', 'Katia Parodi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['MR-guided proton therapy: a review and a preview.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'MRI-based IMRT planning for MR-linac: comparison between CT- and MRI-based plans for pancreatic and prostate cancers.', 'Imaging issues specific to hadrontherapy (proton, carbon, helium therapy and other charged particles) for radiotherapy planning, setup, dose monitoring and tissue response assessment.', 'Converging Proton Minibeams with Magnetic Fields for Optimized Radiation Therapy: A Proof of Concept.', 'MR-guided proton therapy: a review and a preview.', 'Benchmarking a GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo model for proton beams in magnetic fields.']"""

This study aims to develop a novel model for predicting positive prostate biopsy based on serum androgen levels. This study included 253 Japanese patients who underwent prostate biopsy at our institution. TT and FT, %FT (=FT/TT), age, PSA, prostate volume (PV) and PSA density (PSAD = PSA/PV) were assessed for association with prostate biopsy findings. The following results were obtained. Of 253 patients, 145 (57.3%) had positive biopsies. Compared to the negative biopsy group, the positive biopsy group demonstrated higher age, PSA and PSAD but lower PV, FT and %FT by univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated PSA, PSAD and %FT were independent predictors of cancer detection. We developed a predictive model based on PSAD and %FT, for which the area under the curve was significantly greater than that of PSA (0.82 vs 0.66), a well-known predictor. Applying this analysis to the subset of patients with PSA <10 ng/mL yielded similar results. We confirmed the utility of this model in another independent cohort of 88 patients.

The pathogenesis of carcinosarcomas is not clearly understood and remains a subject of debate. Whilst there is some research conceptualizing the histopathological findings of bladder carcinosarcomas, the demographic features, clinical outcomes, prognosis and treatment options remain unclear.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 12 consecutive cases of patients with sarcoma-toid bladder cancer who were treated surgically at a single Urology Department be-tween 1999 and 2015. Radiology, pathology and surgical reports were reviewed to determine the pathological staging at the time of cystectomy. These were directly compared with 230 patients having cystectomies for urothelial cell carcinoma. The sarcomatoid patients, were compared to patients with urothelial cell cancers. The other histological sub types, squamous cell (17), neuroendocrine (9), metastatic (7), mixed (4), adenocarcinoma (3), were not included.  Results and conclusion:   Carcinosarcoma of the urinary bladder is often described in the literature as a highly malignant neoplasm that is rapidly lethal. We found that the sarcoma does not offer a worse prognosis than conventional high-grade urothelial car-cinoma. There is no significant difference in grade, stage, positive surgical margin rate, nodal involvement, associated prostate cancer or incidence rates of progression, all cause or disease specific mortality. There was a barely significant difference in carcinoma in-situ. However, carcinosarcomas are three times the volume of urothelial cell tumors which may contribute to its reputation as an aggressive tumour (44cc v 14cc).

We evaluated whether the addition of EBRT to brachytherapy improves prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) for intermediate- and high-risk disease using a large national database.  Methods and materials:   We identified 5836 patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database with a diagnosis of National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate-risk (Gleason score 7, prostate-specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL, or stage cT2b-T2c) or high-risk (Gleason score 8-10 or prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL and stage ≤cT3a) prostate cancer who had undergone brachytherapy, with or without EBRT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were diagnosed from 2004 through 2009. Intermediate-risk patients with Gleason score ≤3+4 and 1 intermediate-risk factor were considered favorable and all others unfavorable. We used multivariable Fine-Gray competing risks regression to study PCSM while adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors and ADT use.  Results:   Overall, 50.3% of intermediate- and high-risk patients who received brachytherapy and EBRT did not have significantly improved PCSM compared with that of the patients who received brachytherapy alone (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-3.11; P=.322; 5-year PCSM 2.4% vs 1.0%). This lack of benefit was seen among favorable intermediate-risk (AHR 2.66, 95% CI 0.93-7.62, P=.069; 5-year PCSM 1.3% vs 0.6%), unfavorable intermediate-risk (AHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.16-2.96, P=.612; 5-year PCSM 1.0% vs 1.2%), and high-risk (AHR 1.82, 95% CI 0.67-4.98, P=.242; 5-year PCSM 5.3% vs 2.1%) subgroups.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that certain patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy might not benefit from the addition of EBRT.

Material and methods:   A total of 965 patients with painful bone metastases undergoing palliative radiation therapy at a tertiary referral center between 1999 and 2007 were identified. Pain scores were measured at 1, 2, and 3 months after radiation therapy. Pain response was defined as at least a 2-point decrease on a pain score scale of 0-10, without increase in analgesics, or an analgesic decrease of at least 25% without an increase in pain score. Thirteen candidate predictors were identified from the literature and expert experience. After multiple imputation, final predictors were selected using stepwise regression and collapsed into a prediction model. Model performance was evaluated by calibration and discrimination and corrected for optimism.  Results:   Overall 462 patients (47.9%) showed a response. Primary tumor site, performance status, and baseline pain score were predictive for pain response, with a corrected c-statistic of 0.63.

Patients and methods:   A total of 471 patients with high-risk PCa treated with RP and a super-extended PLND that included the removal of the pre-sacral and common iliac nodes between 2006 and 2016 were identified. The risk of LNI was calculated according to the Briganti nomogram. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed the association between LNI risk and involvement of the common iliac and pre-sacral regions. The risk of positive common iliac and pre-sacral nodes was plotted over the LNI risk using the LOWESS-smoothed fit curve.  Results:   The median preoperative LNI risk was 25.5%. The median number of nodes removed was 23, and 171 (36.3%) patients had LNI. Overall, 61 (13.0%) and 28 patients (5.9%), respectively, had positive common iliac and pre-sacral nodes alone or in combination with other sites. The LNI risk was associated with the involvement of the common iliac and pre-sacral regions (all P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with positive common iliac and pre-sacral nodes progressively increased according to the LNI risk. The adoption of a 30% threshold would result in avoiding the removal of the common iliac and pre-sacral nodes in >60% cases, with a risk of missing LNI in these regions of <5%.

In this study we conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the significance of radiation-induced EMT and consequential changes to the tumor microenvironment in biochemical recurrence and response to radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Expression profiling and localization for EMT effectors, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, β-catenin and Vimentin was assessed in human prostate tumor specimens pre- and post-radiotherapy and correlated with biochemical recurrence. In addition, immunoreactivity of the DNA repair enzyme, polymerase (PARP-1) and the cytoskeletal-remodeling regulator, cofilin was evaluated in prostate tumor specimens pre- and post-radiotherapy and correlated with pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA).  Results:   Our findings identified that characteristic changes associated with the EMT phenotype and its reversal to mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET) within the tumor microenvironment correlate with biochemical recurrence and resistance to radiotherapy among prostate cancer patients. Moreover, elevated PARP-1 expression among the tumor cells undergoing EMT implicates that DNA repair mechanisms may potentially reverse the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy-induced DNA breaks.

Approximately 30-40% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) also have neuroendocrine involvement. In contrast primary small cell prostate cancer is very rare (<1%). A t‑NEPC should be clinically suspected in patients who have particularly aggressive mCRPC but a disproportionately low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and elevated neuroendocrine tumor markers, such as chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. The initial Gleason score was shown to be an independent factor correlated to the risk of development of t‑NEPC. Treatment is oriented to that of small cell lung cancer. In patients with negative PSA levels, chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide is the first line treatment, for which response rates in the range of 30-60% with a median survival time of usually less than 1 year can be achieved.

We investigated whether arctigenin, a novel anti-inflammatory lignan from the seeds of Arctium lappa, has favorable bioavailability/potency against prostate cancer. The anticarcinogenic activity of arctigenin was investigated both in vitro using the androgen-sensitive LNCaP and LAPC-4 human prostate cancer cells and pre-malignant WPE1-NA22 cells, and in vivo using xenograft mouse models. Arctigenin at lower doses (< 2μM) significantly inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells by 30-50% at 48h compared to control, and inhibited WPE1-NA22 cells by 75%, while did not affect normal prostate epithelial cells. Male severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were implanted subcutaneously with LAPC-4 cells for in vivo studies. In one experiment, the intervention started one week after tumor implantation. Mice received arctigenin at 50mg/kg (LD) or 100mg/kg (HD) b.w. daily or vehicle control by oral gavage. After 6 weeks, tumor growth was inhibited by 50% (LD) and 70% (HD) compared to control. A stronger tumor inhibitory effect was observed in a second experiment where arctigenin intervention started two weeks prior to tumor implantation. Arc was detectable in blood and tumors in Arc groups, with a mean value up to 2.0 μM in blood, and 8.3 nmol/g tissue in tumors. Tumor levels of proliferation marker Ki67, total and nuclear androgen receptor, and growth factors including VEGF, EGF, and FGF-β were significantly decreased by Arc, along with an increase in apoptosis marker of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Genes responsive to arctigenin were identified including TIMP3 and ZNF185, and microRNAs including miR-126-5p, and miR-21-5p. This study provides the first in vivo evidence of the strong anticancer activity of arctigenin in prostate cancer. The effective dose of arctigenin in vitro is physiologically achievable in vivo, which provides a high promise in its translation to human application.""","""['Piwen Wang', 'Walter Solorzano', 'Tanya Diaz', 'Clara E Magyar', 'Susanne M Henning', 'Jaydutt V Vadgama']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Nutr Exp""","""['Arctigenin inhibits prostate tumor growth in high-fat diet fed mice through dual actions on adipose tissue and tumor.', 'Arctigenin in combination with quercetin synergistically enhances the antiproliferative effect in prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased chemopreventive effect by combining arctigenin, green tea polyphenol and curcumin in prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Enhanced inhibition of prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth by combining quercetin and green tea.', 'Arctigenin, an anti-tumor agent; a cutting-edge topic and up-to-the-minute approach in cancer treatment.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Arctigenin: pharmacology, total synthesis, and progress in structure modification.', 'Arctigenin inhibits apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, and inflammation in human nucleus pulposus cells by up-regulating miR-483-3p.', 'Combinatorial Effects of the Natural Products Arctigenin, Chlorogenic Acid, and Cinnamaldehyde Commit Oxidation Assassination on Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Anticancer Effect of Tanshinones on Female Breast Cancer and Gynecological Cancer.']"""

Moreover, reports for patients with prostate cancer have become increasingly complex with the addition of more pathological details. This study aimed to compare narrative and synoptic prostate cancer reports for core needle biopsies received at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria in order to determine which form was most complete according to international standards.  Methods:   This study was conducted from January 2010 to December 2015 at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. All malignant prostate cancer histopathology reports received during this period were analysed for the presence of important clinicopathological parameters, including the numbers of cores taken and those involved by the tumour, percentage of tumour involvement, Gleason score and the presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasms (HGPINs) and perineural and lymphovascular invasion.  Results:   A total of 83 reports were reviewed, of which 27 were in narrative and 56 in synoptic format. The documentation of clinicopathological characteristics in narrative reports was significantly incomplete compared to synoptic reports in recording the number of cores (33.3% versus 96.4%), number of cores involved by the tumour (11.1% versus 94.6%), percentage of cores involved by the tumour (3.7% versus 100.0%) and the presence of HGPINs (7.4% versus 100.0%) and perineural (59.3% versus 98.2%) and lymphovascular (48.1% versus 100.0%) invasion (P <0.001 each).

However, recent clinical trials using mifepristone in PCa and other cancers have been disappointing. We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activities of mifepristone, in combination with docetaxel and enzalutamide, against bone metastatic castration-resistant PCa.  Materials and methods:   The effects of mifepristone, alone or in combination with docetaxel or enzalutamide, on PCa cell viability, in vitro, were determined by the colorimetric assay. Intratibial model of C4-2-Luc tumors in athymic nude mice was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of mifepristone alone or in combination with docetaxel or enzalutamide. Tumor growth in mouse bone was assessed by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and radiography.  Results:   Although mifepristone exhibits a certain degree of synergism with docetaxel or enzalutamide in cell culture, statistical analyses showed that combination regimens fail to demonstrate effectiveness in suppressing the skeletal growth of PCa and enhancing the in vivo efficacy of docetaxel or enzalutamide in athymic nude mice (p>0.05).  Conclusion:   These results provide the first pre-clinical evidence suggesting that mifepristone may not effectively inhibit bone metastatic PCa, either as a single agent or combined with standard chemotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy.

We investigated the effect of prostate specific antigen on the association of digital rectal examination and clinically significant prostate cancer in a large American cohort.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the records of the 35,350 men who underwent digital rectal examination in the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial for the development of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 or greater). Followup was 343,273 person-years. The primary outcome was the rate of clinically significant prostate cancer among men with vs without suspicious digital rectal examination. We performed competing risks regression to evaluate the interaction between time varying suspicious digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen.  Results:   A total of 1,713 clinically significant prostate cancers were detected with a 10-year cumulative incidence of 5.9% (95% CI 5.6-6.2). Higher risk was seen for suspicious vs nonsuspicious digital rectal examination. Increases in absolute risk were small and clinically irrelevant for normal (less than 2 ng/ml) prostate specific antigen (1.5% vs 0.7% risk of clinically significant prostate cancer at 10 years), clinically relevant for elevated (3 ng/ml or greater) prostate specific antigen (23.0% vs 13.7%) and modestly clinically relevant for equivocal (2 to 3 ng/ml) prostate specific antigen (6.5% vs 3.5%).  Conclusions:   Digital rectal examination demonstrated prognostic usefulness when prostate specific antigen was greater than 3 ng/ml, limited usefulness for less than 2 ng/ml and marginal usefulness for 2 to 3 ng/ml. These findings support the restriction of digital rectal examination to men with higher prostate specific antigen as a reflex test to improve specificity.

The Gleason score (GS), extent of Gleason pattern (GP) 4, maximum linear cross-sectional length (MLCSL), and location of tumor foci were recorded and related to scale on corresponding 3-mm transverse slice prostate maps. Gleason pattern 4 extra-focal disease (GP4EFD) was defined as prostate cancer with any GP 4 not detected by mpMRI and transrectal ultrasound systematic biopsy observed outside a specified ablation zone.

This study aimed to identify 18F-FDG PET/CT findings that might differentiate AIP from PC.  Methods:   FDG-PET/CT findings of 26 AIP and 40 PC patients were reviewed. Pancreatic and extra-pancreatic lesions related findings, including maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and patterns of FDG uptake, were identified and compared.  Results:   All 26 patients with AIP had increased pancreatic FDG uptake. Focal abnormal pancreatic FDG activities were found in 38/40 (95.00%) PC patients, while longitudinal were found in 18/26 (69.23%) AIP patients. SUVmax was significantly different between AIP and PC, both in early and delayed PET/CT scans (p < 0.05).

Our previous work has demonstrated that FPN is decreased in prostate tumors. We sought to identify the molecular pathways regulated by FPN in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   We show that overexpression of FPN induces profound effects in cells representative of multiple histological subtypes of prostate cancer by activating different but converging pathways. Induction of FPN induces autophagy and activates the transcription factors tumor protein 53 (p53) and Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and their common downstream target, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). FPN also induces cell cycle arrest and stress-induced DNA-damage genes. Effects of FPN are attributable to its effects on intracellular iron and can be reproduced with iron chelators. Importantly, expression of FPN not only inhibits proliferation of all prostate cancer cells studied but also reduces growth of tumors derived from castrate-resistant adenocarcinoma C4-2 cells in vivo.  Innovation:   We use a novel model of FPN expression to interrogate molecular pathways triggered by iron depletion in prostate cancer cells. Since prostate cancer encompasses different subtypes with a highly variable clinical course, we further explore how histopathological subtype influences the response to iron depletion. We demonstrate that prostate cancer cells that derive from different histopathological subtypes activate converging pathways in response to FPN-mediated iron depletion. Activation of these pathways is sufficient to significantly reduce the growth of treatment-refractory C4-2 prostate tumors in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our results may explain why FPN is dramatically suppressed in cancer cells, and they suggest that FPN agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhiyong Deng', 'David H Manz', 'Suzy V Torti', 'Frank M Torti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Antioxid Redox Signal""","""['Myeloid zinc-finger 1 (MZF-1) suppresses prostate tumor growth through enforcing ferroportin-conducted iron egress.', 'Elevated expression of ZNF217 promotes prostate cancer growth by restraining ferroportin-conducted iron egress.', 'Nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 suppresses prostate cancer cells growth and migration through upregulating ferroportin.', 'Effect of ferroportin polymorphism on iron homeostasis and infection.', 'The cardinal roles of ferroportin and its partners in controlling cellular iron in and out.', 'Iron Metabolism in Cancer and Senescence: A Cellular Perspective.', 'Relevant Membrane Transport Proteins as Possible Gatekeepers for Effective Pharmacological Ascorbate Treatment in Cancer.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'Elevated labile iron in castration-resistant prostate cancer is targetable with ferrous iron-activatable antiandrogen therapy.', 'Highly Metastatic Subpopulation of TNBC Cells Has Limited Iron Metabolism and Is a Target of Iron Chelators.']"""

Methods:   Forty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this study and were divided randomly into two groups, which were treated by the standard PR technique (standard PR group; n = 24) or the three-layer PR technique using peritoneum (three-layer PR group; n = 24) during RARP. We prospectively analyzed the continence rate by the 1-hour pad test. All patients underwent urethrocystography at 6 days postoperatively to evaluate position of vesicourethral junction. Pelvic MRI was also performed at 6 months postoperatively for anatomical evaluation.  Results:   Four weeks after RARP, the urinary continence rate was significantly higher in the three-layer PR group (57%) than in the standard PR group (26%, p = 0.036). Urethrocystography demonstrated that the postoperative craniocaudal distance from the symphysis pubis to the level of the vesicourethral junction was significantly shorter in the three-layer PR group than in the standard PR group (p < 0.01), suggesting that there was less tension on the vesicourethral anastomosis after three-layer PR. MRI confirmed that three-layer PR provided firmer reinforcement of the structures, supporting the posterior aspect of the urethral sphincter complex.  Conclusions:   This prospective comparative study might suggest that three-layer two-step PR using peritoneum during RARP is a simple and feasible method seeming to improve early recovery of postoperative continence compared with standard two-step PR, although larger multicenter randomized controlled trials will be needed.""","""['Soichiro Ogawa', 'Seiji Hoshi', 'Tomoyuki Koguchi', 'Junya Hata', 'Yuichi Sato', 'Hidenori Akaihata', 'Masao Kataoka', 'Nobuhiro Haga', 'Yoshiyuki Kojima']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Editorial Comment on: Three-Layer Two-Step Posterior Reconstruction Using Peritoneum During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy to Improve Recovery of Urinary Continence: A Prospective Comparative Study by Ogawa et al.', 'Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support (ARVUS) during Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: One-year Functional Outcomes in a Two-group Randomised Controlled Trial.', 'Combined bladder neck preservation and posterior musculofascial reconstruction during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy: effects on early and long term urinary continence recovery.', 'Simple suturing of the bladder neck muscle layer at the vesicourethral anastomosis site to the dorsal vein complex during anterior reconstruction led to a better postoperative urinary continence after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current techniques to improve outcomes for early return of urinary continence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Urinary Continence Recovery after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy without Anterior or Posterior Reconstruction: Experience from a Tertiary Referral Center.', 'Anatomical Fundamentals and Current Surgical Knowledge of Prostate Anatomy Related to Functional and Oncological Outcomes for Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'How to Prevent and Manage Post-Prostatectomy Incontinence: A Review.', 'Improvement in early urinary continence recovery after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy based on postoperative pelvic anatomic features: a retrospective review.']"""

Patients and methods:   Cabozantinib was administered (100 mg, once daily) to patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic cancers. Those with stable disease at week 12 were randomised 1:1 to cabozantinib or placebo. Primary end-points were objective response rate (ORR) at week 12 and progression-free survival (PFS) in the randomised phase.  Results:   A total of 526 patients were enrolled. The highest ORR was observed in ovarian cancer (OC) (21.7%); the largest PFS benefit was observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (median 5.5 versus 1.4 months for placebo; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.04, 0.52). Disease control rates were >40% for CRPC, OC, melanoma, metastatic breast cancer (MBC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer. Median duration of response ranged from 3.3 (MBC) to 11.2 months (OC).

AR signaling is also essential for the development of hormone-dependent prostate cancer (PCa) and its activity can be blocked by androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs). Although PCa patients initially respond well to ADTs, the cancer inevitably relapses and progresses to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although AR activity is generally restored in CRPC despite the castrate level of androgens, it is unclear whether AR signaling is significantly reprogrammed. In this study, we examined the AR cistrome in a PCa cell line-derived CRPC model using integrated bioinformatical analyses. Significantly, we found that the AR cistrome is largely retained in the CRPC stage. In particular, AR-mediated lipid biosynthesis is highly conserved and reactivated during the progression to CRPC, and increased level of lipid synthesis is associated with poor prognosis. The restoration of lipid biosynthetic pathways is partially due to the increased expression of AR splice variants. Blocking lipid/cholesterol synthesis in AR variants-expressing CRPC cell line and xenograft models markedly reduces tumor growth through inhibition of mTOR pathway. Silencing the expression of a fatty acid elongase, ELOVL7, also leads to the regression of CRPC xenograft tumors. These results demonstrate the importance of reactivation of AR-regulated lipid biosynthetic pathways in driving CRPC progression, and suggest that ADTs may be therapeutically enhanced by blocking lipid biosynthetic pathways.""","""['W Han', 'S Gao', 'D Barrett', 'M Ahmed', 'D Han', 'J A Macoska', 'H H He', 'C Cai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Prostate cancer: Conserved lipid synthesis drives castration resistance.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Upregulation of Scavenger Receptor B1 Is Required for Steroidogenic and Nonsteroidogenic Cholesterol Metabolism in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'M6A-modified circRBM33 promotes prostate cancer progression via PDHA1-mediated mitochondrial respiration regulation and presents a potential target for ARSI therapy.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Receptor-Mediated Redox Imbalance: An Emerging Clinical Avenue against Aggressive Cancers.']"""

Current guidelines recommend serum testosterone measurement to assess the efficacy of ADT and to define castration resistance. However, serum testosterone does not reflect the exclusive effect of castration due to its extratesticular production. The aim of this study is to analyze if serum LH reflects better than serum testosterone the activity of LH-RH agonists.

In a validation cohort of 147 PCa patients, 124 on ""LH-RH agonists"" and 19 ""off LH-RH agonists"", serum testosterone was also measured with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC MSMS).  Results:   The area under the curve (AUC) to distinguish patients ""on versus off LH-RH agonists"" was 0.997 for serum LH and 0.740 for serum testosterone, P < 0.001.

Foxp1-Shq1 deletion restores expression of AR target genes repressed in tumors with Pten loss, circumventing PI3K-mediated repression of the androgen axis.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors in a group of men who did not achieve sufficient erectile function from the medication in the short term following surgery.  Materials and methods:   Prospectively collected data from patients with postprostatectomy ED, initial failure of PDE5-inhibitor treatment at 3 and/or 6 months and at least 12 months' follow-up were included. All patients had completed the International Index of Erectile Function short-form questionnaires (IIEF-5) before surgery and at follow-up visits. Response to PDE5 inhibitors was defined as an IIEF-5 score of at least 17.  Results:   The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 349 patients. At 12 months, 228 patients were still using PDE5 inhibitors. Of these patients, 92 had undergone bilateral and 120 had undergone unilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomies. Overall, 42 PDE5-inhibitor users (18%) were responders at 12 months. Bilateral nerve sparing was the only independent predictor of a late response (odds ratio = 2.9). Thus, 28% of bilaterally nerve-spared patients were responders, while corresponding numbers for unilaterally nerve-spared patients and non-nerve-spared patients were 13% and 6%, respectively.

The PTEN tumor suppressor is thought to function primarily as a PI(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase, limiting activation of this pathway. Here we show that PTEN also functions as a PI(3,4)P2 3-phosphatase, both in vitro and in vivo. PTEN is a major PI(3,4)P2 phosphatase in Mcf10a cytosol, and loss of PTEN and INPP4B, a known PI(3,4)P2 4-phosphatase, leads to synergistic accumulation of PI(3,4)P2, which correlated with increased invadopodia in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells. PTEN deletion increased PI(3,4)P2 levels in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and it inversely correlated with PI(3,4)P2 levels across several EGF-stimulated prostate and breast cancer lines.

As the size and coordination number of metals for imaging, such as 68Ga3+, and for targeted therapy, such as 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3+, are substantially different, they may show a preference for macrocycles of different denticity. We have prepared three simple conjugates that target PSMA and form radiometal complexes through coordination by either octa-, deca-, or dodecadentate tetraazacyclododecane chelators. The complex formation and metal ion selectivity of these constructs were determined at two relevant temperatures, complex stability was examined in vitro, and tumor targeting was demonstrated in preclinical PCa models with a view towards identifying a candidate with potential value as a theranostic agent for the imaging and therapy of mCRPCa.  Methods:   Three bifunctional chelates with high denticity, including the octadentate chelate DOTA, the decadentate 3p-C-DEPA and a novel dodecadentate analogue of DEPA, were synthesized and conjugated to a glutamate-urea-lysine (EuK) pharmacophore (EuK-DOTA, EuK-107 and EuK-106, respectively) to enable targeting of PSMA. The metal ion selectivity for each construct was determined by incubation at 25 °C and 95 °C with the trivalent radiometals 68Ga3+, 111In3+, 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3+. PSMA binding affinity was determined by competitive binding using LNCaP cells, while in vivo tumor targeting of the 68Ga-labeled constructs was examined by positron emission tomography (PET) in LNCaP xenograft tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   PMSA affinities (IC50 values) were 13.3 ± 0.9 nM for EuK-DOTA, 18.0 ± 3.7 nM for EuK-107 and 42.6 ± 6.6 nM for EuK-106. EuK-107 and EuK-DOTA proved to rapidly and near quantitatively complex 68Ga3+, 111In3+, 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3+ at 95 °C, with EuK-107 also rapidly complexing 111In3+ and 177Lu3+ at 25 °C. The inability of EuK-106 to chelate 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3+ suggests that size of the cavity of the macrocylic ring may be more critical than the number of donor groups for the chelation of larger radiometals. In vivo, 68Ga-EuK-107 proved to have similar uptake to 68Ga-DKFZ-PSMA-617, a theranostic ligand currently in clinical evaluation, in a PSMA positive xenograft tumor model.  Conclusions:   The broad metal ion selectivity, good in vitro affinity for PSMA and good in vivo tumor targeting suggest that EuK-107, with the 3p-C-DEPA chelator, merits further evaluation as a theranostics construct in prostate cancer.""","""['James M Kelly', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Dohyun Kim', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'Shankar Vallabhajosula', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled PSMA I&T: Optimization of a PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Concept and First Proof-of-Concept Human Studies.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled (R)- vs (S)-DOTAGA Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeting Derivatives.', 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the bifunctional chelator NODIA-Me in combination with a prostate-specific membrane antigen targeting vector.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Affinity probes based on small-molecule inhibitors for tumor imaging.', 'Design, synthesis, and preclinical evaluation of a novel bifunctional macrocyclic chelator for theranostics of cancers.', 'A feasibility study of the therapeutic application of a mixture of 67/64 Cu radioisotopes produced by cyclotrons with proton irradiation.', 'Translating a radiolabeled imaging agent to the clinic.', 'A suitable time point for quantifying the radiochemical purity of 225Ac-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.']"""

Frequently, patients undergoing NBP-treatment experience side-effects, known as acute phase response (APR), resulting from cytokine production by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. As opposed to NBP, statins reduce intracellular phosphoantigen levels and prevent NBP-induced Vγ9Vδ2-T cell activation in vitro. We conducted a pilot study in patients with (bone-)metastasized malignancies receiving NBP-treatment and evaluated the phenotype and function of circulating Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in vivo and the effects of statins on Vγ9Vδ2-T cell responses and the associated APR. We observed reduced expression of perforin, granzyme B and HLA-DR on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in patients treated with NBP and statins.

The expression pattern and role of IQGAP1 has been well established in many cancers, whereas those of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, have mostly remained unexplored. We used available large datasets, to explore the pan-cancer status of these two genes in-silico. Here we have analysed their mRNA expression and correlation with survivability in eight different cancers, including lung, breast, gastric, brain, colorectal, prostate, liver and kidney cancers and, their subtypes. The mRNA expression of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in individual cancers were analysed in two different publicly available databases viz. Oncomine and TCGA. The prognostic value of these genes in lung, breast and gastric cancer was analysed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, whereas for brain, colorectal, liver, prostate and kidney cancers, SurvExpress database was used. These results were validated by immunohistochemistry in cancer tissues (stomach, prostate, brain, colorectal). Moreover, we did IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 genomic alteration and, promoter methylation analysis using cBioportal and Wanderer web tool, respectively. Most of the cancer types (lung, breast, prostate, brain, gastric, liver, kidney and colorectal) showed increased IQGAP3 mRNA expression. In contrast, the IQGAP2 transcript levels were reduced across different cancers viz. lung, breast, gastric, liver, kidney and colorectal cancer. IQGAP2 expression correlated positively with survivability, on the contrary, IQGAP3 expression levels correlated inversely with survivability, in most of the cancers. Collectively, enhanced IQGAP3 and reduced IQGAP2 levels were frequently observed in multiple cancers with the former predicting poor survivability and the later opposite. Methylation pattern was significantly altered in most of the cancer types. We found copy no. variation and mutations in specific cancers, for IQGAP2 and IQGAP3. Our in-vivo (IHC) data confirmed the in-silico findings completely. Hence, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 have potential to be used as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in specific cancers.""","""['Dinesh Kumar', 'Md Khurshidul Hassan', 'Niharika Pattnaik', 'Nachiketa Mohapatra', 'Manjusha Dixit']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Antithetic Roles of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in Cancers.', 'IQGAP2 inactivation through aberrant promoter methylation and promotion of invasion in gastric cancer cells.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the expression and prognosis for IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 are reciprocally altered in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The biology of IQGAP proteins: beyond the cytoskeleton.', 'The Antithetic Roles of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in Cancers.', 'Oncofetal protein IGF2BP1 regulates IQGAP3 expression to maintain stem cell potential in cancer.', 'lncRNA MIR4435-2HG Accelerates the Development of Bladder Cancer through Enhancing IQGAP3 and CDCA5 Expression.', 'Role of IQGAP1 in Carcinogenesis.', 'Identification of Two Novel Candidate Genetic Variants Associated With the Responsiveness to Influenza Vaccination.']"""

IL-12 plays a critical role in the early inflammatory response to infection and in the generation of T-helper type 1 cells, favoring cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 is composed of two different subunits, p40 and p35. This study underlines the importance of IL-12 p40 monomer (p40) in helping cancer cells to escape cell death. We found that different mouse and human cancer cells produced greater levels of p40 than p40 homodimer (p402), IL-12, or IL-23. Similarly, the serum level of p40 was much greater in patients with prostate cancer than in healthy control subjects. Selective neutralization of p40, but not p402, by mAb stimulated death in different cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a tumor model. Interestingly, p40 was involved in the arrest of IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) IL-12Rβ1, but not IL-12Rβ2, in the membrane, and that p40 neutralization induced the internalization of IL-12Rβ1 via caveolin and caused cancer cell death via the IL-12-IFN-γ pathway.

The current study compared objective and subjective sleep disturbance in ADT recipients and controls and examined whether sleep disturbance in ADT recipients is attributable to the influence of ADT on hot flashes and nocturia.  Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer were assessed before or within 1 month after the initiation of ADT as well as 6 months and 12 months later (78 patients). Patients with prostate cancer were treated with prostatectomy only (99 patients) and men with no history of cancer (108 men) were assessed at similar intervals. Participants self-reported their sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index) and interference from hot flashes (Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale). One hundred participants also wore actigraphs for 3 days at the 6-month assessment to measure objective sleep disturbance and reported their nocturia frequency.  Results:   ADT recipients reported worse sleep disturbance, higher rates of clinically significant sleep disturbance, and greater hot flash interference than controls (Ps≤.03). In cross-sectional analyses among those with actigraphy data, ADT recipients had greater objective sleep disturbance and more episodes of nocturia (Ps<.01). Cross-sectional mediation analyses demonstrated that the association between ADT and objectively and subjectively measured sleep disturbance was partly attributable to nocturia and hot flashes (Ps<.05).  Conclusions:   The results of the current study suggest that the association between ADT and sleep may be partly explained by nocturia and hot flash interference. Future studies should examine behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to address these symptoms among ADT recipients.

Genomic deletions can create oncogenic fusion genes or cause the loss of tumor suppressing gene function which can lead to tumorigenesis by downregulating these genes. Detecting these variants has clinical importance in the treatment of diseases. Furthermore, it is also clinically important to detect their breakpoint boundaries at high resolution. We have generalized the framework of a previously-published algorithm that located translocations, and we have applied that framework to develop a method to locate deletions at base pair level using next-generation sequencing data. Our method uses abnormally mapped read pairs, and then subsequently maps split reads to identify precise breakpoints.  Results:   On a primary prostate cancer dataset and a simulated dataset, our method predicted the number, type, and breakpoints of biologically validated SVs at high accuracy. It also outperformed two existing algorithms on precise breakpoint prediction, which is clinically important.  Conclusion:   Our algorithm, called Pegasus, accurately calls deletion breakpoints.

Methods:   A prospective randomized analysis was performed on 262 cases of suspected PCa detected by multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), each with a single suspected lesion with 10 μg/L≤ PSA <20 μg/L. All the patients underwent targeted transrectal prostate biopsy guided by fusion imaging of MRI with transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), using the 6X+6 strategy (6 cores in the suspected region and another 6 in the systematic prostate) for 134 cases and the traditional 12+2X method (12 cores in the systematic prostate and 2 in the suspected region) for the other 128. Comparisons were made between the two methods in the PCa detection rate in the cases of suspected lesion, total PCa detection rate, incidence of post-biopsy complications, and Gleason scores. Analyses were performed on the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score, location, transverse section, and diameter of the suspected lesion.  Results:   Both the total PCa detection rate and that in the cases of suspected lesion were significantly higher in the 6X+6 (44.8% and 37.3%) than in the 12+2X group (37.5% and 27.3%) (P<0.05). MRI showed that the suspected lesions were mostly (45%) located in the middle part of the prostate, the mean area of the transverse section was (0.48±0.11) cm2, and the mean diameter of the tumor was (8.51±2.21) mm. The results of biopsy showed that low-grade tumors (Gleason 3+3=6) accounted for 68% in the 6X+6 group and 71% in the 12+2X group. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in the incidence rate of post-biopsy complications.  Conclusions:   Compared with the traditional 12+2X method, for the suspected lesion manifested by mp-MRI, focusing biopsy on the suspected region with the 6X+6 strategy can achieve a higher PCa detection rate without increasing the incidence of complications.""","""['Hua-Wei Qu', 'Hui Liu', 'Zi-Lian Cui', 'Xun-Bo Jin', 'Yong Zhao', 'Mu-Wen Wang', 'Wei Song', 'Xin-Juan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'Is targeted magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy enough for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with PI-RADS ≥3: Results of a prospective, randomized clinical trial.', 'Early experience with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies under visual transrectal ultrasound guidance in patients suspicious for prostate cancer undergoing repeated biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Furthermore, we aimed at comparing excess risk of cancer according to diabetes type, diabetes duration and treatment, the latter as regards Type 2 diabetes.  Methods:   By use of the Reggio Emilia diabetes registry we classified the resident population aged 20-84 at December 31st 2009 into two groups: with and without diabetes. By linking with the cancer registry we calculated the 2010-2013 cancer incidence in both groups. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) by cancer site, type of diabetes, diabetes duration, and as concerns Type 2 diabetes, by treatment regimen were computed using Poisson regression model and non-diabetic group as reference.  Results:   The cohort included 383,799 subjects without diabetes and 23,358 with diabetes. During follow-up, we identified 1464 cancer cases in subjects with diabetes and 9858 in the remaining population. Overall cancer incidence was higher in subjects with diabetes than in those without diabetes (IRR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.15-1.29), with similar results focusing on subjects with at least 2-year diabetes duration. Cancer sites driving overall increased risk were liver, pancreas, Colon rectum, and bladder in both sexes, corpus uteri for females. There was also suggestion of an increased risk for kidney cancer in females and a decreased risk for prostate cancer. Excess risk was found in patients with Type 2 diabetes, more marked among insulin users, especially with combined therapy. We observed an increasing risk for diabetes duration up to 10 years from diagnosis (IRR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.29-1.61) and a subsequent decrease to moderate-higher risk (IRR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.04-1.30).

We conducted an experiment verifying that miR-486-5p drives tumorigenesis by directly targeting multiple negative regulators, which were involved in PTEN/PI3K/Akt, FOXO, and TGF-b/Smad2 signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and TCF-12 are located at the miR-486-5p promoter, which stimulates the transcription of miR-486-5p itself. Collectively, our findings unveil miR-486-5p as a powerful prostate cancer driver that coordinates the activation of multiple oncogenic pathways and demonstrates some stimulators, which mediate the miR-486-5p signaling pathway and may be targeted for therapy.""","""['Yang Yang', 'Changwei Ji', 'Suhan Guo', 'Xin Su', 'Xiaozhi Zhao', 'Shiwei Zhang', 'Guangxiang Liu', 'Xuefeng Qiu', 'Qing Zhang', 'Hongqian Guo', 'Huimei Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-296-5p (miR-296-5p) functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by directly targeting Pin1.', 'The oncogenic MicroRNA Hsa-miR-155-5p targets the transcription factor ELK3 and links it to the hypoxia response.', 'Down-regulation of miR-675-5p contributes to tumor progression and development by targeting pro-tumorigenic GPR55 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Androgen receptor regulated microRNA miR-182-5p promotes prostate cancer progression by targeting the ARRDC3/ITGB4 pathway.', 'MicroRNA-106b-5p boosts glioma tumorigensis by targeting multiple tumor suppressor genes.', 'Small ankyrin 1 (sANK1) promotes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as new tools for delivery of miRNAs in the treatment of cancer.', 'miRNA-486-5p: signaling targets and role in non-malignant disease.', 'Combined miR-486 and GP88 (Progranulin) Serum Levels Are Suggested as Supportive Biomarkers for Therapy Decision in Elderly Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'miR-486-5p and miR-22-3p Enable Megakaryocytic Differentiation of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells without Thrombopoietin.']"""

However, these anticancer properties have not been clinically approved due to unclear mechanistic information and its low bioactivity. In our previous study, we elucidated that quercetin activates AMPK pathway which is the major mechanism for its unique anticancer effect in bladder cancer. In the present study, we are trying to enhance its bioactivity by chemical modification using fluorination approach to prepare novel chemical entities, based on the principle of intermediate derivative method (IDM). The compound we obtained is named 8-trifluoromethyl-3,5,7,3',4'-O-pentamethyl- quercetin (TFQ), characterized by NMR spectra and mass spectrum (MS). The results from MTT and cologenic assay in two human and one murine bladder cancer cell lines showed that TFQ exhibits more potent inhibition on the three bladder cancer cell lines than quercetin (Que) although this enhanced effects is not very dramatic. Furthermore, we found that the survival of normal bladder cells PEBC was not significantly suppressed by TFQ compared with Que. Western blot analysis showed that TFQ possess more potent AMPK activation than Que. The downstream of AMPK was further examined by western blot. TFQ treatment is able to inactivate mTOR signaling pathway with the regulation of mTOR, 4EBP1 and P70S6K. These results demonstrated that the fluorinated quercetin derivative TFQ inhibits bladder cancer cell growth through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Altogether, our findings suggest that TFQ could serve as a new potential therapeutic agent for bladder cancer more effective than Que.""","""['Ting Tao', 'Caimei He', 'Jun Deng', 'Yanjun Huang', 'Qiongli Su', 'Mei Peng', 'Meiling Yi', 'Kwame Oteng Darko', 'Hui Zou', 'Xiaoping Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Quercetin induces bladder cancer cells apoptosis by activation of AMPK signaling pathway.', 'hepaCAM and p-mTOR closely correlate in bladder transitional cell carcinoma and hepaCAM expression inhibits proliferation via an AMPK/mTOR dependent pathway in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Sauchinone exerts anticancer effects by targeting AMPK signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Repurposing of nitroxoline as a potential anticancer agent against human prostate cancer: a crucial role on AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and the interplay with Chk2 activation.', 'A comprehensive view on the quercetin impact on bladder cancer: Focusing on oxidative stress, cellular, and molecular mechanisms.', 'Effects of saponins from Chinese herbal medicines on signal transduction pathways in cancer: A review.', 'Selectively Halogenated Flavonolignans-Preparation and Antibacterial Activity.', 'Properties of flavonoids in the treatment of bladder cancer (Review).']"""

Patients and methods:   In a prospective clinical trial, mCRPC patients underwent whole-exome sequencing (n = 82) and RNA sequencing (n = 75) of metastatic biopsies before initiating AA/P with the objective of identifying genomic alterations associated with resistance to AA/P. Primary resistance was determined at 12 weeks of treatment using criteria for progression that included serum prostate-specific antigen measurement, bone and computerized tomography imaging and symptom assessments. Acquired resistance was determined using the end point of time to treatment change (TTTC), defined as time from enrollment until change in treatment from progressive disease. Associations of genomic and transcriptomic alterations with primary resistance were determined using logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, single and multivariate analyses. Cox regression models were utilized for determining association of genomic and transcriptomic alterations with TTTC.  Results:   At 12 weeks, 32 patients in the cohort had progressed (nonresponders). Median study follow-up was 32.1 months by which time 58 patients had switched treatments due to progression. Median TTTC was 10.1 months (interquartile range: 4.4-24.1).

While its autonomic nerve supply has been studied at the microscopic level, little information is available concerning the macroscopic topography of extrinsic nerve fibres. This study was designed to identify neural connections between the pelvic plexus and the IAS, provide a detailed topographical description, and give histological proof of autonomic nerve tissue.  Methods:   Macroscopic dissection of pelvic autonomic nerves was performed under magnification in seven (five male, two female) hemipelvises obtained from body donors (67-92 years). Candidate structures were investigated by histological and immunohistochemical staining protocols to visualize nerve tissue.  Results:   Nerve fibres could be traced from the anteroinferior edge of the pelvic plexus to the anorectal junction running along the neurovascular bundle anterolaterally to the rectum and posterolaterally to the prostate/vagina. Nerve fibres penetrated the longitudinal rectal muscle layer just above the fusion with the levator ani muscle (conjoint longitudinal muscle) and entered the intersphincteric space to reach the IAS. Histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the presence of nerve tissue.  Conclusions:   Autonomic nerve fibres supplying the IAS emerge from the pelvic plexus and are distinct to nerves entering the rectum via the lateral pedicles. Thus, they should be classified as IAS nerves. The identification and precise topographical location described provides a basis for nerve-sparing rectal resection procedures and helps to prevent postoperative functional anorectal disorders.""","""['S Stelzner', 'M Böttner', 'J Kupsch', 'W Kneist', 'P Quirke', 'N P West', 'H Witzigmann', 'T Wedel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Colorectal Dis""","""['Nerve supply to the internal anal sphincter differs from that to the distal rectum: an immunohistochemical study of cadavers.', 'Internal anal sphincter parasympathetic-nitrergic and sympathetic-adrenergic innervation: a 3-dimensional morphological and functional analysis.', 'Nerves in the intersphincteric space of the human anal canal with special reference to their continuation to the enteric nerve plexus of the rectum.', 'Anorectal functional study.

To determine whether tris(hydroxypyridinone) (THP) bifunctional chelators offer a potential solution to this problem, we have evaluated the labelling and biodistribution of a THP conjugate with a new single-chain antibody against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), an attractive target for staging prostate cancer (PCa). A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of J591, a monoclonal antibody that recognises an external epitope of PSMA, was prepared in order to achieve biokinetics matched to the half-life of gallium-68. The scFv, J591c-scFv, was engineered with a C-terminal cysteine.  Results:   J591c-scFv was produced in HEK293T cells and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. A maleimide THP derivative (THP-mal) was coupled site-specifically to the C-terminal cysteine residue. The THP-mal-J591c-scFv conjugate was labelled with ammonium acetate-buffered gallium-68 from a 68Ge/68Ga generator at room temperature and neutral pH. The labelled conjugate was evaluated in the PCa cell line DU145 and its PSMA-overexpressing variant in vitro and xenografted in SCID mice. J591c-scFv was produced in yields of 4-6 mg/l culture supernatant and efficiently coupled with the THP-mal bifunctional chelator. Labelling yields > 95% were achieved at room temperature following incubation of 5 μg conjugate with gallium-68 for 5 min without post-labelling purification. 68Ga-THP-mal-J591c-scFv was stable in serum and showed selective binding to the DU145-PSMA cell line, allowing an IC50 value of 31.5 nM to be determined for unmodified J591c-scFv. Serial PET/CT imaging showed rapid, specific tumour uptake and clearance via renal elimination. Accumulation in DU145-PSMA xenografts at 90 min post-injection was 5.4 ± 0.5%ID/g compared with 0.5 ± 0.2%ID/g in DU145 tumours (n = 4).  Conclusions:   The bifunctional chelator THP-mal enabled simple, rapid, quantitative, one-step room temperature radiolabelling of a protein with gallium-68 at neutral pH without a need for post-labelling purification.

Methods:   Three patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma were imaged with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. All lesions with perceptible radiotracer uptake above background were considered positive. Maximum standardized uptake values were recorded for each detected lesion and findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT were compared to those on conventional imaging studies. To further explore PSMA as a molecular target of urothelial carcinoma, RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to compare the relative expression of PSMA among cases of bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA was performed on a biopsy specimen from one of the imaged patients.  Results: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT allowed for the detection of sites of urothelial carcinoma, albeit with low levels of radiotracer uptake. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data revealed that bladder cancer had significantly lower levels of PSMA expression than both prostate cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Consistent with this observation, immunohistochemical staining of tissue from one of the imaged patients demonstrated a low level of neovascularization and nearly absent PSMA expression.

Objective:   To compare robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery for risk of conversion to open laparotomy among patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized clinical trial comparing robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery among 471 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection conducted at 29 sites across 10 countries, including 40 surgeons. Recruitment of patients was from January 7, 2011, to September 30, 2014, follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 6 months, and final follow-up was on June 16, 2015.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to robotic-assisted (n = 237) or conventional (n = 234) laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, performed by either high (upper rectum) or low (total rectum) anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection (rectum and perineum).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was conversion to open laparotomy. Secondary end points included intraoperative and postoperative complications, circumferential resection margin positivity (CRM+) and other pathological outcomes, quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), bladder and sexual dysfunction (International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Female Sexual Function Index), and oncological outcomes.  Results:   Among 471 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.0] years; 320 [67.9%] men), 466 (98.9%) completed the study. The overall rate of conversion to open laparotomy was 10.1%: 19 of 236 patients (8.1%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group and 28 of 230 patients (12.2%) in the conventional laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk difference = 4.1% [95% CI, -1.4% to 9.6%]; adjusted odds ratio = 0.61 [95% CI, 0.31 to 1.21]; P = .16). The overall CRM+ rate was 5.7%; CRM+ occurred in 14 (6.3%) of 224 patients in the conventional laparoscopic group and 12 (5.1%) of 235 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk difference = 1.1% [95% CI, -3.1% to 5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.76]; P = .56). Of the other 8 reported prespecified secondary end points, including intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, plane of surgery, 30-day mortality, bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction, none showed a statistically significant difference between groups.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, as compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, did not significantly reduce the risk of conversion to open laparotomy. These findings suggest that robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, when performed by surgeons with varying experience with robotic surgery, does not confer an advantage in rectal cancer resection.

With the aging of the world population, properly understanding the effect of age may facilitate both treatment decision-making and defining the natural history of prostate cancer. Consecutive 581 patients with locally-confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received radical definitive radiotherapy(RT) (76-78 Gy) between 2004 and 2015 at a medical center in Taiwan were reviewed retrospectively. Median age was 78 years. The median follow-up was 66 months. The 5-year biochemical failure-free survival(BFFS), distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), disease-specific survival(DSS), and overall survival(OS) rates were 84.9%, 93.8%, 97.8%, and 86.6%, respectively, for all patients. Comparing those above and below the age of 80, no difference in 5-year BFFS, DMFS, or DSS was found. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that tumor stage, Gleason score, initial PSA, and latency before RT were significant risk factors of BFFS. The latency before RT was significantly longer in the older group than in the under 80 group. Delay to start RT might explain the previous finding of inferior disease control in older patients in other studies.

Because this display is unique to cancer cells, these chaperones are attractive targets for drug development. Previous epitope-mapping of autoantibodies (AutoAbs) from prostate cancer patients identified the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as one such target. Although we previously showed that anti-GRP78 AutoAbs increase tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity on the surface of tumor cells, the direct effect of TF activation on tumor growth was not examined. In this study, we explore the interplay between the AutoAbs against cell surface-associated GRP78, TF expression/activity, and prostate cancer progression. First, we show that tumor GRP78 expression correlates with disease stage and that anti-GRP78 AutoAb levels parallel prostate-specific antigen concentrations in patient-derived serum samples. Second, we demonstrate that these anti-GRP78 AutoAbs target cell-surface GRP78, activating the unfolded protein response and inducing tumor cell proliferation through a TF-dependent mechanism, a specific effect reversed by neutralization or immunodepletion of the AutoAb pool. Finally, these AutoAbs enhance tumor growth in mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts, and heparin derivatives specifically abrogate this effect by blocking AutoAb binding to cell-surface GRP78 and decreasing TF expression/activity. Together, these results establish a molecular mechanism in which AutoAbs against cell-surface GRP78 drive TF-mediated tumor progression in an experimental model of prostate cancer. Heparin derivatives counteract this mechanism and, as such, represent potentially appealing compounds to be evaluated in well-designed translational clinical trials.""","""['Ali A Al-Hashimi', 'Paul Lebeau', 'Fadwa Majeed', 'Enio Polena', 'Šárka Lhotak', 'Celeste A F Collins', 'Jehonathan H Pinthus', 'Mario Gonzalez-Gronow', 'Jen Hoogenes', 'Salvatore V Pizzo', 'Mark Crowther', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Janusz Rak', 'Gabriel Gyulay', ""Sara D'Angelo"", 'Serena Marchiò', 'Renata Pasqualini', 'Wadih Arap', 'Bobby Shayegan', 'Richard C Austin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Binding of anti-GRP78 autoantibodies to cell surface GRP78 increases tissue factor procoagulant activity via the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum stores.', 'Prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro is modulated by antibodies against glucose-regulated protein 78 isolated from patient serum.', 'Changes in oligosaccharide chains of autoantibodies to GRP78 expressed during progression of malignant melanoma stimulate melanoma cell growth and survival.', 'Glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is an important cell surface receptor for viral invasion, cancers, and neurological disorders.', 'GRP78 signaling hub a receptor for targeted tumor therapy.', 'Phytogalactolipids activate humoral immunity against colorectal cancer.', 'Development of a salivary autoantibody biomarker panel for diagnosis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Implication of Serum Autoantibodies in Prognosis of Canine Mammary Tumors.', 'Stressing the endoplasmic reticulum response as a diagnostic tool for sepsis.', 'Scratching the Surface-An Overview of the Roles of Cell Surface GRP78 in Cancer.']"""

We characterize here the elusive premetastatic niche by examining the role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in cancer cell homing. Decreasing the number of MSC pharmacologically enhanced cancer cell homing to the bone marrow in mice. In contrast, increasing the number of these MSCs by various interventions including G-CSF administration diminished cancer cell homing. The MSC subpopulation that correlated best with cancer cells expressed stem, endothelial, and pericytic cell markers, suggesting these cells represent an undifferentiated component of the niche with vascular commitment. In humans, a MSC subpopulation carrying markers for endothelial and pericytic cells was lower in the presence of cytokeratin+ cells in bone marrow. Taken together, our data show that a subpopulation of MSC with both endothelial and pericytic cell surface markers suppresses the homing of cancer cells to the bone marrow. Similar to the presence of cytokeratin+ cells in the bone marrow, this MSC subpopulation could prove useful in determining the risk of metastatic disease, and its manipulation might offer a new possibility for diminishing bone metastasis formation.Significance: These findings establish an inverse relationship between a subpopulation of mesenchymal stromal cells and cancer cells in the bone marrow.

We have previously provided LT estimates for prostate cancer (PCa) using archived blood samples from cohorts followed for many years without screening.  Objective:   To determine the association between LT and PCa grade at diagnosis to provide an insight into whether grade progresses or is stable over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   The setting was three long-term epidemiologic studies in Sweden including men not subject to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. The cohort included 1041 men with PSA of 3-10 ng/ml at blood draw and subsequently diagnosed with PCa with grade data available.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict high-grade (Gleason grade group ≥2 or World Health Organization grade 3) versus low-grade PCa at diagnosis in terms of LT, defined as the time between the date of elevated PSA and the date of PCa diagnosis with adjustment for cohort and age.  Results and limitations:   The probability that PCa would be high grade at diagnosis increased with LT. Among all men combined, the risk of high-grade disease increased with LT (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.16; p<0.0001), with no evidence of differences in effect by age group or cohort. Higher PSA predicted shorter LT by 0.46 yr (95% CI 0.28-0.64; p<0.0001) per 1 ng/ml increase in PSA. However, there was no interaction between PSA and grade, suggesting that the longer LT for high-grade tumors is not simply related to age. Limitations include the assumption that men with elevated PSA and subsequently diagnosed with PCa would have had biopsy-detectable PCa at the time of PSA elevation.  Conclusions:   Our data support grade progression, whereby following a prostate over time would reveal transitions from benign to low-grade and then high-grade PCa.  Patient summary:   Men with a longer lead time between elevated prostate-specific antigen and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis were more likely to have high-grade cancers at diagnosis.""","""['Melissa Assel', 'Anders Dahlin', 'David Ulmert', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pär Stattin', 'Hans Lilja', 'Andrew J Vickers']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Melissa Assel, Anders Dahlin, David Ulmert, et al.

Previous research has demonstrated that chalcones exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, including anticancer, antifungal, and antibiotic properties.  Objective:   Our goal is to synthesize novel heterocyclic-containing chalcones and have their biological activities evaluated. Methods Sixteen chalcones were synthesized by the crossed aldol condensation of substituted tetralones with substituted pyridinylaldehydes. The products were purified by recrystallization in MeOH/H2O and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. Anticancer assays were performed by NCI (National Cancer Institute) against the NCI-60 panel of 60 different human cancer cell lines, including leukemia, non-small-cell lung cancer, colon, central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancer. Antimicrobial assays were performed by COADD (Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, and Candida albicans.  Result:   Chalcone 3d had demonstrated growth inhibition greater than 60% against a variety of cancers: leukemia (MOLT-4, SR), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H522), colon cancer (HCT- 116), prostate cancer (DU-145), and breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-468) and was also cytotoxic to three different cell lines (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226, and KM12). 5c was active against leukemia (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226, SR) and breast cancer (MCF7) and 5e was active only against leukemia (RPMI-8226, SR). 5h was partially active and the best compound with growth inhibition of MRSA by 75%. 3b was the best compound against EC, KP, and PA and 3f had the greatest activity against AB.

To evaluate the influence of the proposed algorithm on ADC values, we perform statistical experiments in three schemes: no processing of the DWI, with the affine transform approach, and with FFD.

In the current study, the authors examined the association between insurance status, race, and CaP outcomes.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program identified 155,524 men aged < 65 years who were diagnosed with CaP from 2007 through 2014. The association between insurance and stage of disease at the time of presentation was examined. Among men with localized CaP, the associations between insurance and receipt of therapy and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were determined.  Results:   Compared with private insurance, men with Medicaid were more likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.01-4.55), were less likely to receive definitive treatment (AOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.62-0.71), and had increased PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.50-2.24), regardless of race. Significant interactions between race and insurance status indicated that insurance had more than an additive association with race. Among privately insured patients, disparities in PCSM (AOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40 [P = .019]) and presentation with metastatic disease (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.21 [P<.001]) were observed. No disparities were observed among patients with Medicaid insurance with regard to PCSM (AOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.52-1.20 [P = .272]) and metastatic disease (AOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80-1.03 [P = .139]).  Conclusions:   Racial disparities in the outcomes of patients with CaP were observed in privately insured cohorts, whereas these disparities appeared to be reduced among patients with Medicaid insurance. However, outcomes need to be improved overall. Whether the equality in outcomes for Medicaid is due to white and African American patients doing ""equally poorly"" or ""equally well"" is unclear.

This study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes and to investigate the potential correlation between gene abnormalities and clinical features in PCa to evaluate disease progression and prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 4 independent microarrays of PCa patients from the Oncomine database were used to identify differences in expression of genes contributing to cancer progression. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of the target in human prostate cancer cells. To explore the relationship between the DNA copy number alteration and mRNA expression changes, dataset containing copy number alteration, DNA methylation, and gene expression in PCa were obtained from the cBioPortal online platform (n=273). RESULTS We identified 40 genes that were significantly dysregulated in PCa from 4 independent microarrays. Among these, 3 genes showed a consistent change of over 2-fold in the 4 microarrays. The mRNA expression of C10orf116 showed consistent expression in prostate cancer cells compared with that in prostate gland cells as assessed by RT-qPCR. Moreover, C10orf116 loss was associated with poor distant relapse-free survival (DFS) by analyzing data of 273 PCa patients, but it was not identified as an independent prognostic risk factor for DFS. In addition, we found that C10orf116 loss was associated with higher pathological stage, higher clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis in PCa, and that C10orf116 copy number was highly correlated with PTEN copy number and mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS As a predictive indicator, C10orf116 loss contributes to our understating of the biology of aggressive changes in PCa and also helps evaluate the prognosis of patients.""","""['Jie Meng', 'Li-Hui Wang', 'Chun-Lin Zou', 'Sheng-Ming Dai', 'Jian Zhang', 'Yi Lu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Expression patterns of candidate susceptibility genes HNF1β and CtBP2 in prostate cancer: association with tumor progression.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Long noncoding RNA ADIRF antisense RNA 1 upregulates insulin receptor substrate 1 to decrease the aggressiveness of osteosarcoma by sponging microRNA-761.', 'The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Comprehensive clinical implications of homeobox A10 in 3,199 cases of non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples combining qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing and microarray data.']"""

Segmentation and classification of histology tissue in H&E stained tumor image datasets is a challenging task because of intra-class variations, inter-class similarity, crowded context, and noisy data. In recent years, deep learning approaches have led to encouraging results in breast cancer and prostate cancer analysis. In this article, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) as a tool to improve efficiency and accuracy of osteosarcoma tumor classification into tumor classes (viable tumor, necrosis) versus nontumor. The proposed CNN architecture contains eight learned layers: three sets of stacked two convolutional layers interspersed with max pooling layers for feature extraction and two fully connected layers with data augmentation strategies to boost performance. The use of a neural network results in higher accuracy of average 92% for the classification. We compare the proposed architecture with three existing and proven CNN architectures for image classification: AlexNet, LeNet, and VGGNet. We also provide a pipeline to calculate percentage necrosis in a given whole slide image.

Inverse probability treatment weights were used to achieve covariate balance between groups.  Results:   Nonrecipients were less likely to receive any of the 7 services compared with recipients of AWVs (63% vs 88%). The total number of services that the AWVs group received was 62% higher than nonrecipients.

Since cytokines are important modulators of various biological processes, this study aims to determine whether EGPs and AGEs affected immune homeostasis differentially and do so through modulating macrophage-derived factors.  Methods and results:   Two systems (glycine-glucose and whey protein isolate (WPI)-glucose) are established to generate glycation products. They are applied to human macrophages (PMA-differentiated U937 cells), and cell viability and cytokine production are measured. Furthermore, EGPs, AGEs, and their conditioned medium (CM) from macrophages are applied to human prostate cancer (PCa) cells with different etiology (LNCaP and PC-3) and murine PCa cells (TRAMP-C2) to determine their direct and indirect effects on PCa cell proliferation. EGPs enhance the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, and this enhancement is associated with increased PCa cell proliferation. In contrast, AGEs inhibit macrophages to secret cytokines, but increase PCa cell proliferation directly.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that EGPs promote the prostate tumor proliferation indirectly through modulating macrophages, while AGEs have a direct effect.""","""['Yingjia Chen', 'Nikolay M Filipov', 'Tai L Guo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Dietary Early Glycation Products Promote the Growth of Prostate Tumors More than Advanced Glycation End-Products through Modulation of Macrophage Polarization.', 'Dietary Advanced Glycation Endproducts Induce an Inflammatory Response in Human Macrophages in Vitro.', 'Glycation of macrophages induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduces phagocytic efficiency.', 'Advanced glycation end-products produced systemically and by macrophages: A common contributor to inflammation and degenerative diseases.', 'Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products and Cardiometabolic Risk.', 'A Literature Review on Maillard Reaction Based on Milk Proteins and Carbohydrates in Food and Pharmaceutical Products: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Avoidance Strategies.', 'Dietary advanced glycation end-products elicit toxicological effects by disrupting gut microbiome and immune homeostasis.', 'The Role of Sarcopenic Obesity in Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease: A Synthesis of the Evidence on Pathophysiological Aspects and Clinical Implications.', 'The crucial role of early-life gut microbiota in the development of type 1 diabetes.', 'Iron and Advanced Glycation End Products: Emerging Role of Iron in Androgen Deficiency in Obesity.']"""

Although pain is one of five health-status dimensions measured by the EQ-5D, our understanding of how pain relates to the other EQ-5D dimensions is limited.  Methods:   We derived data from 5500 patients with bone metastases who completed the EQ-5D and BPI. Regression analyses examined how BPI severity and interference scores correlated with EQ-5D utility scores and how BPI items associated with EQ-5D items, for the entire sample and by disease-type subgroup.  Results:   Regardless of cancer site, the percentage of patients reporting moderate/severe problems in each of the five EQ-5D dimensions were pain/discomfort, 78%; usual activities, 58%; mobility, 55%; anxiety/depression, 57%; and self-care, 26%. BPI pain interference explained more of the variability in the EQ-5D utility scores than did pain severity (R2 = 41% vs. 34%). BPI worst pain, average pain, pain now, interference with general activity, and interference with work significantly predicted EQ-5D pain/discomfort, with odds ratio estimates <1.  Conclusions:   Pain/discomfort was the worst-rated dimension of the EQ-5D in this population, but the relationship of this item to BPI pain severity was modest, suggesting that the single pain item of the EQ-5D may be of limited utility in studies for which pain is an endpoint.  Significance:   Health-status dimensions include more than pain. We examine the contribution of pain severity and pain-related functional interference in determining the health status of cancer patients with bone metastases. The pain dimension from a health-status measure may be an inadequate metric in clinical trials/clinical practice when pain is an important outcome.""","""['T R Mendoza', 'A C Dueck', 'Q Shi', 'H Ma', 'J Zhang', 'Y Qian', 'C S Cleeland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Pain""","""['What Factors are Associated With Quality Of Life, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression in Patients With Metastatic Bone Disease?', 'Do Cohabitants Reliably Complete Questionnaires for Patients in a Terminal Cancer Stage when Assessing Quality of Life, Pain, Depression, and Anxiety?', 'Uneven recovery patterns of compromised health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3\xa0L) domains for breast Cancer survivors: a comparative study.', 'Walking ability, anxiety and depression, significantly decrease EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level scores in older hemodialysis patients in Japan.', 'Systematic review of health state utility values in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a focus on previously treated patients.', 'Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Community- and Choice-Based Health State Utility Values for Lung Cancer.']"""

In this paper, we propose new approaches for combining multiple biomarkers linearly to maximize the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC). The parametric and nonparametric methods that have been developed for this purpose have limitations. When the biomarker values for populations with and without a given disease follow a multivariate normal distribution, it is easy to implement our proposed parametric approach, which adopts an alternative analytic expression of the pAUC. When normality assumptions are violated, a kernel-based approach is presented, which handles multiple biomarkers simultaneously. We evaluated the proposed as well as existing methods through simulations and discovered that when the covariance matrices for the disease and nondisease samples are disproportional, traditional methods (such as the logistic regression) are more likely to fail to maximize the pAUC while the proposed methods are more robust. The proposed approaches are illustrated through application to a prostate cancer data set, and a rank-based leave-one-out cross-validation procedure is proposed to obtain a realistic estimate of the pAUC when there is no independent validation set available.""","""['Qingxiang Yan', 'Leonidas E Bantis', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Ziding Feng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Easy and accurate variance estimation of the nonparametric estimator of the partial area under the ROC curve and its application.', 'Combining biomarkers for classification with covariate adjustment.', 'On the use of min-max combination of biomarkers to maximize the partial area under the ROC curve.', 'Biomarker selection for medical diagnosis using the partial area under the ROC curve.', 'Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: practical review for radiologists.', 'Statistical assessment of the prognostic and the predictive value of biomarkers-A biomarker assessment framework with applications to traumatic brain injury biomarker studies.', 'Conditional concordance-assisted learning under matched case-control design for combining biomarkers for population screening.', 'LINEAR BIOMARKER COMBINATION FOR CONSTRAINED CLASSIFICATION.', ""Biomarkers of Alzheimer syndrome and related dementias: A&D author's guide."", 'Combining biomarkers by maximizing the true positive rate for a fixed false positive rate.']"""

This chapter describes the implementation of an AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) biosensor assay to screen for small molecules that can induce AR-TIF2 PPIs, inhibit the DHT-induced formation of AR-TIF2 PPIs, or disrupt pre-existing AR-TIF2 PPIs. The biosensor assay employs high content imaging and analysis to quantify AR-TIF2 PPIs and integrates physiologically relevant cell-based assays with the specificity of binding assays by incorporating structural information from AR and TIF2 functional domains along with intracellular targeting sequences using fluorescent protein reporters. Expression of the AR-Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) ""prey"" and TIF2-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) ""bait"" components of the biosensor is directed by recombinant adenovirus (rAV) expression constructs that facilitated a simple co-infection protocol to produce homogeneous expression of both biosensors that is scalable for screening. In untreated cells, AR-RFP expression is localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and TIF2-GFP expression is localized only in the nucleoli of the nucleus. Exposure to DHT induces the co-localization of AR-RFP within the TIF2-GFP positive nucleoli of the nucleus. The AR-TIF2 biosensor assay therefore recapitulates the ligand-induced translocation of latent AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and the PPIs between AR and TIF2 result in the colocalization of AR-RFP within TIF2-GFP expressing nucleoli. The AR-TIF2 PPI biosensor approach offers significant promise for identifying molecules with potential to modulate AR transcriptional activity in a cell-specific manner that may overcome the development of resistance and progression to CRPC.""","""['Yun Hua', 'Daniel P Camarco', 'Christopher J Strock', 'Paul A Johnston']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Erratum to: High Content Screening.', 'High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'High-content positional biosensor screening assay for compounds to prevent or disrupt androgen receptor and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 protein-protein interactions.', 'Reconfiguring the AR-TIF2 Protein-Protein Interaction HCS Assay in Prostate Cancer Cells and Characterizing the Hits from a LOPAC Screen.', 'Recent progress in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting androgen receptor-coactivator binding in prostate cancer.', 'Noncellular screening for the discovery of protein-protein interaction modulators.', 'Undesirable Status of Prostate Cancer Cells after Intensive Inhibition of AR Signaling: Post-AR Era of CRPC Treatment.', 'Selecting a minimal set of androgen receptor assays for screening chemicals.', 'Assays to Interrogate the Ability of Compounds to Inhibit the AF-2 or AF-1 Transactivation Domains of the Androgen Receptor.', 'High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this work, a novel fluorescence sensing platform is fabricated by bio-grafting quantum dots (QDs) onto the surface of electrospun nanofibers (NFs). The aptamer integrated into the QDs/NFs can result in high specificity for recognizing and capturing biomarkers. Partially complementary DNA-attached gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed to efficiently hybridize with the remaining aptamer to quench the fluorescence of QDs by nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) between them both, which are constructed for prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay. Taking advantage of the networked nanostructure of aptamer-QDs/NFs, the fluorescent film can detect PSA with high sensitivity and a detection limit of 0.46 pg mL-1, which was further applied in real clinical serum samples.

In recent years, combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy has been suggested to overcome this problem. The aim of the current study was to explore the potential synergistic effects of N-Myc Downstream-Regulated Gene 2 (NDRG2) overexpression, a newly identified candidate tumor suppressor gene, with radiotherapy against proliferation of prostate LNCaP cell line.  Materials and methods:   In this study, LNCaP cells were exposed to X-ray radiation in the presence or absence of NDRG2 overexpression using plasmid PSES- pAdenoVator-PSA-NDRG2-IRES-GFP. The effects of NDRG2 overexpression, X-ray radiation or combination of both on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells were then analyzed using MTT assay and flow cytometery, respectively.  Results:   Results of MTT assay showed that NDRG2 overexpression and X-ray radiation had a synergistic effect against proliferation of LNCaP cells. Moreover, NDRG2 overexpression increased apoptotic effect of X-ray radiation in LNCaP cells synergistically.

However, the role of miR-454 in prostate cancer remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function and molecular mechanisms of miR-454 in prostate cancer. We found that miR-454 was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines (*p<0.05), as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay and cell invasion assay showed that the inhibition of miR-454 significantly suppressed prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion (*p<0.05), whereas the overexpression of miR-454 markedly promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion (*p<0.05). Bioinformatics analysis showed that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2), a well-known tumor suppressor, was identified as a potential target gene of miR-454. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-454 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of NDRG2. RT-qPCR and western blot showed that miR-454 overexpression significantly decreased NDRG2 expression (*p<0.05), whereas miR-454 inhibition markedly promoted NDRG2 expression (*p<0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that miR-454 expression was inversely correlated with NDRG2 expression in prostate cancer tissues (r=-0.8932; p<0.0001). Moreover, miR-454 inhibition significantly suppressed the protein expression of β-catenin (*p<0.05) and blocked the activation of WNT signaling (*p<0.05). In addition, small interfering RNA mediated NDRG2 knockdown significantly reversed the antitumor effect of miR-454 inhibition on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion (*p<0.05).

We wished to assess the impact of index PSA (iPSA) level prior to SRT on rates of biochemical failure (BCF) post treatment.  Methods:   Patients referred to our institution for SRT for a rising PSA post surgery were accrued onto a prospective database. Baseline demographic data, tumour and treatment factors were collected including pathologic T and N stage, margin status, Gleason score (GS), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and time from surgery to salvage radiotherapy. Our endpoint was time to BCF.  Results:   Between January 2008 and December 2013, 189 patients received SRT to a mean dose of 69.8 Gy in 34 fractions using Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). Median follow-up was 50 months. For patients with an iPSA of <0.2 ng/mL (n = 92), iPSA ≥ 0.2 to <1.0 ng/mL (n = 75) and ≥ 1.0 ng/mL (n = 22), rates of BCF at 5 years were 28.3%, 44.3% and 73.7% respectively. Compared to the iPSA <0.2 ng/mL group, the hazard ratios for time to BCF for an iPSA ≥ 0.2 to <1.0 ng/mL was 1.73 (P = 0.05) and >1.0 ng/mL was 3.1 (P = 0.002). Factors predicting time to BCF on univariate analysis included iPSA, GS, T stage, PSA nadir post surgery and LVSI. On multivariate analysis, GS, iPSA, use of ADT, T stage, PSA post surgery nadir and margin status remained significant.

Here, we examined the association between urine levels of chemokines/adipokines with histological markers of prostate inflammation, obesity, and lower urinary tract symptoms LUTS in BPH patients.  Methods:   Frozen urine specimens from 207 BPH/LUTS patients enrolled in Nashville Men's Health Study were sent for blinded analysis of 11 analytes, namely sIL-1RA, CXC chemokines (CXCL-1, CXCL-8, CXCL-10), CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5), PDGF-BB, interleukins IL-6, IL-17, and sCD40L using Luminex™ xMAP® technology. After adjusting for age and medication use, the urine levels of analytes were correlated with the scales of obesity, prostate inflammation grade, extent, and markers of lymphocytic infiltration (CD3 and CD20) using linear regression.  Results:   sIL-1RA levels were significantly raised with higher BMI, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio in BPH patients after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.02). Men with greater overall extent of inflammatory infiltrates and maximal CD3 infiltration were marginally associated with CXCL-10 (P = 0.054) and CCL5 (P = 0.054), respectively. CCL3 in 15 patients with moderate to severe grade inflammation was marginally associated with maximal CD20 infiltration (P = 0.09), whereas CCL3 was undetectable in men with mild prostate tissue inflammation. There was marginal association of sCD40L with AUA-SI scores (P = 0.07).  Conclusions:   Strong association of sIL-1RA in urine with greater body size supports it as a major molecular correlate of obesity in the urine of BPH patients. Increased urine levels of CXCL-10, CCL5, and CCL3 were marginally associated with the scores for prostate tissue inflammation and lymphocytic infiltration.

By differential expression and combined meta-analysis of all cohorts, we detected significantly higher SFRP4 expression in cancer compared with normal samples, and in high (3-5) compared with low (1-2) Grade Group samples. SFRP4 expression was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in six of seven cohorts and in the overall analysis, and was a significant predictor of metastatic event in one cohort. In our study cohort, where metabolic information was available, SFRP4 expression correlated significantly with the concentrations of citrate and spermine, two previously suggested biomarkers for aggressive prostate cancer. SFRP4 immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort (n = 33) was not associated with aggressiveness. To conclude, high SFRP4 gene expression is associated with high Grade Group and recurrent prostate cancer after surgery. Future studies investigating the mechanistic and clinical usefulness of SFRP4 in prostate cancer are warranted.""","""['Elise Sandsmark', 'Maria K Andersen', 'Anna M Bofin', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'Finn Drabløs', 'Tone F Bathen', 'Morten B Rye', 'May-Britt Tessem']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 inhibits proliferation and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Membranous expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 predicts for good prognosis in localized prostate cancer and inhibits PC3 cellular proliferation in vitro.', 'A novel non-canonical Wnt signature for prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Low expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 in aggressive pituitary adenoma.', 'Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 and its implications in cancer and apoptosis.', 'Sfrp4 expression in thyroxine treated calvarial cells.', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Identification of senescence-related molecular subtypes and key genes for prostate cancer.', 'Spatio-temporal analysis of prostate tumors in situ suggests pre-existence of treatment-resistant clones.', 'SFRP4 Is a Potential Biomarker for the Prognosis and Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer.']"""

Cell membrane is an optimal target that promises an effective treatment outcome.  Objectives:   We previously developed a novel photosensitizer named porphyrus envelope (PE) by combining hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) with lipidated protoporphyrin IX (PpIX lipid). In the current study, the cellular localization of PE and its ability to induce multiple anti-tumor effect were characterized.  Materials and methods:   The localization and uptake of PpIX lipid in cells were evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy and a cell-based fluorescent assay, respectively. The ability of PE to suppress the migration and proliferation of cancer cells was assessed using a scratch-wound assay. The synergistic effect of PDT and HVJ-E treatment was evaluated using an in vitro experiment with PC-3 cells.  Results:   PE localized along the cell membrane and PpIX lipid accumulated selectively in the prostate cancer cells within 10min. Also, PE maintained the ability to undergo fusion and induce cancer cell death even after light irradiation at the dose for PDT. Incubation with PE resulted in delayed migratory and proliferative activity of PC-3 cells. PE-mediated PDT was twice as effective when cells were further incubated with PE following PDT.  Conclusions:   PE allows rapid drug delivery targeting the cell membrane. Because the cytotoxicity of HVJ-E was maintained, synergistic effect of HVJ-E and the photochemical reactions resulted in highly effective killing of prostate cancer cells in vitro and thus represents a promising treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Mizuho Inai', 'Norihiro Honda', 'Hisanao Hazama', 'Sharmin Akter', 'Shinichiro Fuse', 'Hiroyuki Nakamura', 'Tomoyuki Nishikawa', 'Yasufumi Kaneda', 'Kunio Awazu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['A novel photodynamic therapy for drug-resistant prostate cancer cells using porphyrus envelope as a novel photosensitizer.', 'In vitro investigation of efficient photodynamic therapy using a nonviral vector; hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope.', 'In vitro investigation of efficient photodynamic therapy using a nonviral vector; hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope.', 'The advantages of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in dermatology.', 'Nitric Oxide Inhibition of Chain Lipid Peroxidation Initiated by Photodynamic Action in Membrane Environments.', 'Photodynamic therapy by lysosomal-targeted drug delivery using talaporfin sodium incorporated into inactivated virus particles.', 'Photoimmunotherapy of Ovarian Cancer: A Unique Niche in the Management of Advanced Disease.']"""

Eleven study plans that included a cohort of prostate, head and neck, and brain treatment sites were optimized using both PRO and PO algorithms. A plan template using the same objectives for the same number of iterations was used for each optimized plan to obtain hypothetical treatment plans that would be comparable with a clinical plan. Analysis was performed using plan conformity-based parameters such as target volume coverage factor, conformation number and homogeneity indices, and plan complexity assessment parameters such as small aperture score, modulation indices, and monitor unit variation with arc angle for prostate, brain and head, and neck IMAT treatment plans. Plan conformality analysis demonstrated that conformation numbers, target volume coverage factors, and homogeneity indices produced by the 2 optimizers were comparable for most anatomic sites. IMAT treatment plans produced using the PRO optimizer were found to be less complex than plans produced using the PO optimizer, in terms of multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf position variability and modulation complexity scores. Similarly, the PRO optimizer was shown to produce treatment plans that used fewer monitor units (and generally fewer monitor unit per degree of arc rotation) than PO optimizer. This study demonstrated that the PO optimizer can produce IMAT treatment plans with a similar degree of dose conformity to the target volume and generally improved organ at risk sparing, compared with the PRO optimizer. Better coverage to organs at risk produced by plans optimized using PO was observed to have higher MLC variability and monitor units. Therefore, careful evaluation of treatment plan conformity and complexity before assessing its deliverability is recommended when implementing the routine use of PO optimizer.""","""['Diana Binny', 'Tanya Kairn', 'Craig M Lancaster', 'Jamie V Trapp', 'Scott B Crowe']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Progressive resolution optimizer (PRO) predominates over photon optimizer (PO) in sparing of spinal cord for spine SABR VMAT plans.', 'Clinical evaluation of photon optimizer (PO) MLC algorithm for stereotactic, single-dose of VMAT lung SBRT.', 'Photon Optimizer (PO) prevails over Progressive Resolution Optimizer (PRO) for VMAT planning with or without knowledge-based solution.', 'Improving treatment efficiency via photon optimizer (PO) MLC algorithm for synchronous single-isocenter/multiple-lesions VMAT lung SBRT.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison of prostate VMAT plans optimized using the photon and progressive resolution algorithm.', 'Progressive resolution optimizer (PRO) predominates over photon optimizer (PO) in sparing of spinal cord for spine SABR VMAT plans.', 'An integrated solution of deep reinforcement learning for automatic IMRT treatment planning in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Tree-based exploration of the optimization objectives for automatic cervical cancer IMRT treatment planning.', 'Effect of treatment planning system parameters on beam modulation complexity for treatment plans with single-layer multi-leaf collimator and dual-layer stacked multi-leaf collimator.', 'Analysis of prostate intensity- and volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy planning quality with PlanIQTM.']"""

For intensity modulated carbon ion therapy (IMCT), it is desirable to use Monte Carlo (MC) methods to compute the properties of each pencil beam spot for treatment planning, because of their accuracy in modeling physics processes and estimating biological effects. We previously developed goCMC, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-oriented MC engine for carbon ion therapy. The purpose of the present study was to build a biological treatment plan optimization system using goCMC.  Methods and materials:   The repair-misrepair-fixation model was implemented to compute the spatial distribution of linear-quadratic model parameters for each spot. A treatment plan optimization module was developed to minimize the difference between the prescribed and actual biological effect. We used a gradient-based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The system was embedded in the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system under a client-server architecture to achieve a user-friendly planning environment. We tested the system with a 1-dimensional homogeneous water case and 3 3-dimensional patient cases.  Results:   Our system generated treatment plans with biological spread-out Bragg peaks covering the targeted regions and sparing critical structures. Using 4 NVidia GTX 1080 GPUs, the total computation time, including spot simulation, optimization, and final dose calculation, was 0.6 hour for the prostate case (8282 spots), 0.2 hour for the pancreas case (3795 spots), and 0.3 hour for the brain case (6724 spots). The computation time was dominated by MC spot simulation.  Conclusions:   We built a biological treatment plan optimization system for IMCT that performs simulations using a fast MC engine, goCMC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that full MC-based IMCT inverse planning has been achieved in a clinically viable time frame.""","""['Nan Qin', 'Chenyang Shen', 'Min-Yu Tsai', 'Marco Pinto', 'Zhen Tian', 'Georgios Dedes', 'Arnold Pompos', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Katia Parodi', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A GPU-accelerated and Monte Carlo-based intensity modulated proton therapy optimization system.', 'Initial development of goCMC: a GPU-oriented fast cross-platform Monte Carlo engine for carbon ion therapy.', 'A new approach to integrate GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation into inverse treatment plan optimization for proton therapy.', 'Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'Carbon Ion Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer: A Review.', 'Fixed Beamline Optimization for Intensity Modulated Carbon-Ion Therapy.', 'Biological Rationale and Clinical Evidence of Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy for Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma: A Narrative Review.', 'Simultaneous optimization of RBE-weighted dose and nanometric ionization distributions in treatment planning with carbon ions.']"""

Because mitochondrial dysfunction is an early hallmark of hypoxia and inflammation, an unbiased proteomics approach was used to assess the mitochondria in a mouse model of colitis. Through this analysis, we identified a ferrireductase: six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 4 (STEAP4) was highly induced in mouse models of colitis and in IBD patients. STEAP4 was regulated in a hypoxia-dependent manner that led to a dysregulation in mitochondrial iron balance, enhanced reactive oxygen species production, and increased susceptibility to mouse models of colitis. Mitochondrial iron chelation therapy improved colitis and demonstrated an essential role of mitochondrial iron dysregulation in the pathogenesis of IBD. To address if mitochondrial iron dysregulation is a key mechanism by which inflammation impacts colon tumorigenesis, STEAP4 expression, function, and mitochondrial iron chelation were assessed in a colitis-associated colon cancer model (CAC).

Here, we examined the menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of menthol (50-500µM) was predicted to be mediated by the transient receptor potential ion channel melastatin subtype 8 (TRPM8). However, the intensity of menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals did not correlate with the expression levels of TRPM8 in breast and prostate cancer cells indicating a TRPM8-independent signaling pathway. Menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals were analyzed in detail in Du 145 prostate cancer cells, as well as in CRISPR/Cas9 TRPM8-knockout Du 145 cells. Menthol (500µM) induced Ca2+ oscillations in both cell lines, thus independent of TRPM8, which were however dependent on the production of inositol trisphosphate. Results based on pharmacological tools point to an involvement of the purinergic pathway in menthol-evoked Ca2+ responses. Finally, menthol (50-500µM) decreased cell viability and induced oxidative stress independently of the presence of TRPM8 channels, despite that temperature-evoked TRPM8-mediated inward currents were significantly decreased in TRPM8-knockout Du 145 cells compared to wild type Du 145 cells.""","""['Mustafa Nazıroğlu', 'Walter Blum', 'Katalin Jósvay', 'Bilal Çiğ', 'Thomas Henzi', 'Zoltán Oláh', 'Csaba Vizler', 'Beat Schwaller', 'László Pecze']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Menthol regulates TRPM8-independent processes in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Involvement of transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) in menthol-induced calcium entry, reactive oxygen species production and cell death in rheumatoid arthritis rat synovial fibroblasts.', 'Novel role of cold/menthol-sensitive transient receptor potential melastatine family member 8 (TRPM8) in the activation of store-operated channels in LNCaP human prostate cancer epithelial cells.', 'TRPM8 ion channel ligands for new therapeutic applications and as probes to study menthol pharmacology.', 'TRPM8 in prostate cancer cells: a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker with a secretory function?', 'TRPM8 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by inducing SNORA55 mediated nuclear-mitochondrial communication.', 'Global Trends and Hotspots of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 Research from 2002 to 2021: A Bibliometric Analysis.', 'Integrating transcriptomics and network analysis-based multiplexed drug repurposing to screen drug candidates for M2 macrophage-associated castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Trpm8 Expression in Human and Mouse Castration Resistant Prostate Adenocarcinoma Paves the Way for the Preclinical Development of TRPM8-Based Targeted Therapies.', 'Brain Region-Specific nAChR and Associated Protein Abundance Alterations Following Chronic Nicotine and/or Menthol Exposure.']"""

Under the conditions of steady state of the reaction network and the non-negativity of fluxes, metabolic networks can be algebraically decomposed into a set of sub-pathways often referred to as extreme currents (ECs). Our objective is to find the statistical association of such sub-pathways with given clinical outcomes, resulting in a particular instance of a self-contained gene set analysis method. In this direction, we propose a method based on sparse group lasso (SGL) to identify phenotype associated ECs based on gene expression data. SGL selects a sparse set of feature groups and also introduces sparsity within each group. Features in our model are clusters of ECs, and feature groups are defined based on correlations among these features.  Results:   We apply our method to metabolic networks from KEGG database and study the association of network features to prostate cancer (where the outcome is tumor and normal, respectively) as well as glioblastoma multiforme (where the outcome is survival time). In addition, simulations show the superior performance of our method compared to global test, which is an existing self-contained gene set analysis method.

Since PSMA expression is not restricted to prostate cancer, the underlying study investigates PSMA expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Material and methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PSMA expression in n = 275 samples of NSCLC tissue specimens. By means of CD34 co-expression, the level of PSMA expression in tumor associated neovasculature was investigated. The impact of PSMA expression on clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis was evaluated.  Results:   PSMA tumor cell expression in NSCLC is as low as 6% and was predominantly found in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.002). Neovascular PSMA expression was found in 49% of NSCLC. High neovascular PSMA expression was associated with higher tumor grading (G3/G4) (p < 0.001). Neither for PSMA tumor cell expression, nor for PSMA neovascular cell expression prognostic effects were found for the investigated NSCLC cases.  Conclusion:   Here, we report on the expression of PSMA in NSCLC tissue samples.

The current study aims to investigate the expression of SCCRO in PC tumor tissues, further its clinical significance, and proliferation inhibiting effect on PC cells in vitro.  Patients and methods:   RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of SCCRO in PC tissue and corresponding adjacent normal tissues from 160 cases, and its relationship with clinical pathological characteristics was analyzed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmid targeting SCCRO gene was constructed and transferred into PC cell line Lncap. The effect on proliferation was observed by CCK8 assay, and its influence on invasion and migration of Lncap cells was studied by Transwell Matrigel assay after SCCRO gene was silenced. The expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) influenced by SCCRO silencing were detected by Western blot.  Results:   mRNA expression of SCCRO protein increased significantly in cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissue, especially for T3+T4, N+, and III+IV patients (p<0.05). SCCRO expression was an independent prognostic factor (p<0.05). After SCCRO gene was knocked down by siRNA, the SCCRO protein level decreased 78.4% in the siRNA-3 group. By CCK8 assay, knocking down SCCRO in Lncap significantly reduced the cell proliferation, as well as its migration and invasion capability compared to siRNA-control group (p<0.01) by transwell invasion and migration assay. The expression of FAK and MMP-2 also reduced in siRNA-3 group compared to siRNA control group (p<0.01).  Conclusions:   SCCRO is associated with progression and prognosis of PC. After SCCRO gene was transferred, the growth of Lncap cells was inhibited, and ability of invasion and migration decreased by reducing the expression of FAK and MMP-2.

Unlike the case in breast cancer, no clinically validated biomarker has been used to predict the outcomes of androgen-deprivation therapy. To evaluate androgen-receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) detection in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer and describe the distinctive prognosis of this novel molecular subtype, this study retrospectively enrolled 168 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients from 2003 to 2015 who received androgen-deprivation therapy. AR-V7 immunohistochemical staining was performed with a monoclonal antibody, and AR-V7 expression was determined using Immune-Reactive Score data. The association between nuclear AR-V7 expression and prognosis was determined. Multiple cause-specific Cox regression and stratified cumulative incidences were used to analyze the prognosis risk. Among the 168 patients, 32 (19%) were AR-V7-positive. Compared with the AR-V7-negative patients, the AR-V7-positive patients had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen response rates (P<0.001) to androgen-deprivation therapy and a much shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (P<0.0001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the AR-V7-positive group showed markedly lower castration-resistant prostate cancer progression-free survival (P<0.0001) and much lower cancer-specific (P<0.0001) and overall survival (P<0.0001) both in all enrolled patients and in patients with metastases. AR-V7 positivity was a significant predictor of castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in multiple Cox regression (hazard ratio: 4.826; 95% CI: 2.960-7.869; P<0.001). AR-V7 immunohistochemical detection in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients who are planning to receive androgen-deprivation therapy, especially those with metastases, is necessary and valuable for prognostic assessment. AR-V7-positive prostate cancer should be considered a novel prostate cancer subtype that should be distinguished upon initial biopsy.

A crucial prerequisite is generating the so called pseudo-CT (pCT) images for accurate dose calculation and planning. Many pCT generation methods have been proposed in the scope of photon radiotherapy. This work aims at verifying for the first time whether a commercially available photon-oriented pCT generation method can be employed for accurate intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) dose calculation. A retrospective study was conducted on ten prostate cancer patients. For pCT generation from MR images, a commercial solution for creating bulk-assigned pCTs, called MR for Attenuation Correction (MRCAT), was employed. The assigned pseudo-Hounsfield Unit (HU) values were adapted to yield an increased agreement to the reference CT in terms of proton range. Internal air cavities were copied from the CT to minimise inter-scan differences. CT- and MRCAT-based dose calculations for opposing beam IMPT plans were compared by gamma analysis and evaluation of clinically relevant target and organ at risk dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters. The proton range in beam's eye view (BEV) was compared using single field uniform dose (SFUD) plans. On average, a [Formula: see text] mm) gamma pass rate of 98.4% was obtained using a [Formula: see text] dose threshold after adaptation of the pseudo-HU values. Mean differences between CT- and MRCAT-based dose in the DVH parameters were below 1 Gy ([Formula: see text]). The median proton range difference was [Formula: see text] mm, with on average 96% of all BEV dose profiles showing a range agreement better than 3 mm. Results suggest that accurate MR-based proton dose calculation using an automatic commercial bulk-assignment pCT generation method, originally designed for photon radiotherapy, is feasible following adaptation of the assigned pseudo-HU values.""","""['Matteo Maspero', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg', 'Guillaume Landry', 'Claus Belka', 'Katia Parodi', 'Peter R Seevinck', 'Bas W Raaymakers', 'Christopher Kurz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Investigating deformable image registration and scatter correction for CBCT-based dose calculation in adaptive IMPT.', 'Investigating the generalisation of an atlas-based synthetic-CT algorithm to another centre and MR scanner for prostate MR-only radiotherapy.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'MR-guided proton therapy: a review and a preview.', 'A study to determine the impact of IMPT optimization techniques on prostate synthetic CT image sets dose comparison against CT image sets.', 'An MRI sequence independent convolutional neural network for synthetic head CT generation in proton therapy.', 'Roadmap: proton therapy physics and biology.', 'Dosimetric impact of geometric distortions in an MRI-only proton therapy workflow for lung, liver and pancreas.', 'Clinical experience and workflow challenges with magnetic resonance-only radiation therapy simulation and planning for prostate cancer.']"""

However, MR images cannot readily provide the electron density information necessary for radiotherapy dose calculation. An algorithm which generates synthetic CTs for dose calculations from MR images of the prostate using an atlas of 3 T MR images has been previously reported by two of the authors. This paper aimed to evaluate this algorithm using MR data acquired at a different field strength and a different centre to the algorithm atlas. Twenty-one prostate patients received planning 1.5 T MR and CT scans with routine immobilisation devices on a flat-top couch set-up using external lasers. The MR receive coils were supported by a coil bridge. Synthetic CTs were generated from the planning MR images with ([Formula: see text]) and without (sCT) a one voxel body contour expansion included in the algorithm. This was to test whether this expansion was required for 1.5 T images. Both synthetic CTs were rigidly registered to the planning CT (pCT). A 6 MV volumetric modulated arc therapy plan was created on the pCT and recalculated on the sCT and [Formula: see text]. The synthetic CTs' dose distributions were compared to the dose distribution calculated on the pCT. The percentage dose difference at isocentre without the body contour expansion (sCT-pCT) was [Formula: see text] and with ([Formula: see text]-pCT) was [Formula: see text] (mean ± one standard deviation). The [Formula: see text] result was within one standard deviation of zero and agreed with the result reported previously using 3 T MR data. The sCT dose difference only agreed within two standard deviations. The mean ± one standard deviation gamma pass rate was [Formula: see text] for the sCT and [Formula: see text] for the [Formula: see text] (with [Formula: see text] global dose difference and [Formula: see text] distance to agreement gamma criteria). The one voxel body contour expansion improves the synthetic CT accuracy for MR images acquired at 1.5 T but requires the MR voxel size to be similar to the atlas MR voxel size. This study suggests that the atlas-based algorithm can be generalised to MR data acquired using a different field strength at a different centre.""","""['Jonathan J Wyatt', 'Jason A Dowling', 'Charles G Kelly', 'Jill McKenna', 'Emily Johnstone', 'Richard Speight', 'Ann Henry', 'Peter B Greer', 'Hazel M McCallum']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Applying a commercial atlas-based synthetic Computed Tomography algorithm to patients with hip prostheses for prostate Magnetic Resonance-only radiotherapy.', 'Regression and statistical shape model based substitute CT generation for MRI alone external beam radiation therapy from standard clinical MRI sequences.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'An MRI sequence independent convolutional neural network for synthetic head CT generation in proton therapy.', 'Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'MRI-only treatment planning: benefits and challenges.']"""

Materials and methods:   108 men (age range 46-78 years) with clinical suspicion for PCa (PSA > 4 ng/mL) underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate (mpMRI) and, when suspicious lesion were found (according to the PIRADSv2 scoring system), targeted biopsy was performed. All patients without significant alteration patterns at mpMRI have been referred for follow-up at 1 year.  Results:   91/108 patients showed on the mpMRI highly suspicious lesions (PIRADS 4 and 5); the remaining 17/108 patients revealed no significant alteration consistent with PCa (PIRADS 3). Among the first group of patients, 58/91 proved to be positive for PCa on the pathology report: 24 patients had a Gleason Score (GS) 6 (3 + 3); 18 patients GS 7 of which 7 (3 + 4) and 11 (4 + 3); 14 patients GS 8 (4 + 4); two patients GS 9 (5 + 4); 33 proved to be negative. Overall cancer detection rate (CDR) was 63%. However, the CDR rises significantly, up to 77%, after the 53 initial consecutive biopsies that were performed (p < 0,05) and thus identified as part of the learning curve. Patients of the second group (17/108) have been followed with serial PSA assessments, clinical reevaluation, and follow-up mpMRI.

Material and methods:   We retrospectively assessed 117 consecutive hormone-naïve BCR patients who had 68Ga-PSMA 11 PET/CT (n = 46) or PET/MRI (n = 71) between May 2014 and January 2017. BCR was defined as two PSA rises above 0.2 ng/ml. Two dedicated uro-oncological imaging experts (radiology/nuclear medicine) reviewed separately all images. All results were presented in a blinded sequential fashion to a multidisciplinary tumorboard in order to assess the influence of PSMA-PET imaging on decision-making.  Results:   The median time from RP to BCR was 36 months (IQR 16-72). Overall, 69 (59%) patients received postoperative radiotherapy. Median PSA level at the time of imaging was 1.04 ng/ml (IQR 0.58-1.87). PSMA-positive lesions were detected in 100 (85.5%) patients. Detection rates were 65% for a PSA value of 0.2 to <0.5 ng/ml, 85.7% for 0.5 to <1, 85.7% for 1 to <2 and 100% for ≥2. PSMA-positive lesions could be confirmed by either histology (16%), PSA decrease in metastasis-directed radiotherapy (45%) or additional information in diffusion-weighted imaging when PET/MRI was performed (18%) in 79% of patients. PSMA-PET detected lesions in 67 patients (57.3%) who had no suspicious correlates according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria on MRI or CT. PSMA-PET changed therapeutic decisions in 74.6% of these 67 patients (p < 0.001), with 86% of them being considered for metastases-directed therapies.

This LC-MS/MS method for profiling TCA cycle intermediates offers significant advantages including simple and fast preparation of a wide range of human biological samples. The analytical method was validated according to the guideline of the Royal Society of Chemistry Analytical Methods Committee. The limits of detection were below 60 nM for most of the TCA intermediates with the exception of lactic and fumaric acids. The calibration curves of all TCA analytes showed linearity with correlation coefficients r2 > 0.9998. Recoveries were >95% for all TCA analytes.

The basic knowledge of these characteristics is important to elucidate the unique features of various cells and causative factors of diseases and determine the most effective treatments for diseases. Recently, acoustic tweezers based on tightly focused ultrasound microbeam have attracted considerable attention owing to their capability to grab and separate a single cell from a heterogeneous cell sample and to measure its physical cell properties. However, the measurement cannot be performed while trapping the target cell, because the current method uses long ultrasound pulses for grabbing one cell and short pulses for interrogating the target cell. In this paper, we demonstrate that short ultrasound pulses can be used for generating acoustic trapping force comparable to that with long pulses by adjusting the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). This enables us to capture a single cell and measure its physical properties simultaneously. Furthermore, it is shown that short ultrasound pulses at a PRF of 167 kHz can trap and separate either one red blood cell or one prostate cancer cell and facilitate the simultaneous measurement of its integrated backscattering coefficient related to the cell size and mechanical properties.""","""['Min Gon Kim', 'Jinhyoung Park', 'Hae Gyun Lim', 'Sangpil Yoon', 'Changyang Lee', 'Jin Ho Chang', 'K Kirk Shung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Cell Deformation by Single-beam Acoustic Trapping: A Promising Tool for Measurements of Cell Mechanics.', 'Acoustic Trapping Technique for Studying Calcium Response of a Suspended Breast Cancer Cell: Determination of Its Invasion Potentials.', 'Ultrasonic manipulation of single cells.', 'High-Performance Ultrasonic Tweezers for Manipulation of Motile and Still Single Cells in a Droplet.', 'Label-free resistive-pulse cytometry.', 'In-vivo programmable acoustic manipulation of genetically engineered bacteria.', 'Ultrasonic High-Resolution Imaging and Acoustic Tweezers Using Ultrahigh Frequency Transducer: Integrative Single-Cell Analysis.', 'Advances in Microfluidics for Single Red Blood Cell Analysis.', 'Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models.', 'Automated cell-type classification combining dilated convolutional neural networks with label-free acoustic sensing.']"""

Low risk disease spans any potential volume of Gleason score 6 cancer without sufficient attention to tumor volume in the past. Therefore, we compared tumor characteristics in men at low risk on active surveillance to men treated with radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated an institutional cohort of 1,633 men with very low risk disease (clinical stage T1c, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cm3, 2 or more positive cores and 50% or greater core involvement) and low risk disease (clinical stage T2a or less, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml and Gleason score 6 or less). Among patients at low risk we calculated the proportion who failed to meet very low risk volume criteria (greater than 2 positive cores or greater than 50% core involvement). Clinical and pathological metrics in the active surveillance cohort were compared to those in a cohort of men at low risk who underwent radical prostatectomy in the current era of 2011 to 2016.  Results:   In the active surveillance cohort 1,119 men (69%) met very low risk criteria and 514 (31%) had low risk disease. In the low risk population only 138 men (27%) harbored higher volume cancer exceeding very low risk criteria compared to 815 (82%) at low risk who underwent radical prostatectomy (p <0.001). Overall the low risk active surveillance population had fewer positive biopsy cores (median 1 vs 3, p <0.001) and a lower maximum percent of core involvement (median 10% vs 40%, p <0.001) compared to patients at low risk who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Data supporting the safety of active surveillance in men at low risk at our institution were derived from a distinct subgroup harboring a limited cancer volume. Until acceptable outcomes are confirmed for higher volume tumors it is important to remain mindful of these limitations before broadly recommending active surveillance to all low risk men.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Mufaddal Mamawala', 'Hiten D Patel', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Ashley E Ross', 'H Ballentine Carter']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Erratum.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Biopsy Core Features are Poor Predictors of Adverse Pathology in Men with Grade Group 1 Prostate Cancer.', 'Expanded criteria to identify men eligible for active surveillance of low risk prostate cancer at Johns Hopkins: a preliminary analysis.', 'Prospective evaluation of men with stage T1C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Platform for Prostate Cancer Grading and Quantification.', 'Advances in the selection of patients with prostate cancer for active surveillance.', 'Determining Clinically Based Factors Associated With Reclassification in the Pre-MRI Era using a Large Prospective Active Surveillance Cohort.', 'Long-Term Outcomes of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Experience.', 'PTEN status assessment in the Johns Hopkins active surveillance cohort.']"""

Objective:   To investigate the efficacy and tolerance of subsequent treatments in patients treated upfront with chemo-hormonal therapy for mCNPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective data from the GETUG-AFU 15 phase 3 trial were collected for treatments received for mCRPC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   For the first three lines of salvage treatment for mCRPC we investigated the biochemical progression-free survival, maximum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, overall survival, and tolerance.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 245 patients received at least one treatment for mCRPC. For docetaxel used in first-line, a PSA decline ≥50% was observed in 25/66 (38%) and in 4/20 patients (20%) who had received upfront ADT alone and ADT plus docetaxel (p=0.14). The median biochemical progression-free survival was 6.0 mo (95% confidence interval: 3.6-7.7) and 4.1 mo (95% confidence interval: 1.3-4.9), respectively. For docetaxel used in first- or second-line, a PSA decline ≥50% was observed in 36/80 (45%) and in 4/29 patients (14%) who had received upfront ADT alone and ADT plus docetaxel (p=0.07). PSA declines ≥50% were observed with bicalutamide in 12/28 (43%) and 4/23 patients (17%) who had received upfront ADT alone and ADT plus docetaxel. Among men treated upfront with ADT plus docetaxel who received abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC, 10/19 patients (53%) achieved a PSA decline ≥50%. Few grade 3-4 events occurred.

Conclusions:   Docetaxel rechallenge following progression to mCRPC after upfront ADT plus docetaxel for mCNPC was active only in a limited number of patients. Available data on abiraterone and enzalutamide support maintained efficacy in this setting. The lack of standardized therapeutic protocols for men developing mCRPC limits the comparability between patients.

However, there may be underuse of guideline-recommended care in this potentially curable cohort.  Objective:   To assess European physicians' current practice in the management of NMIBC and evaluate its concordance with the EAU 2013 guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   Initial 45-min telephone interviews were conducted with 20 urologists to develop a 26-item questionnaire for a 30-min online quantitative interview. A total of 498 physicians with predefined experience in treatment of NMIBC patients, from nine European countries, completed the online interviews.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics of absolute numbers and percentages of the use of diagnostic tools, risk group stratification, treatment options chosen, and follow-up regimens were used.  Results and limitations:   Guidelines are used by ≥87% of physicians, with the EAU guidelines being the most used ones (71-100%). Cystoscopy (60-97%) and ultrasonography (42-95%) are the most used diagnostic techniques. Using EAU risk classification, 40-69% and 88-100% of physicians correctly identify all the prognostic factors for low- and high-risk tumours, respectively. Re-transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (re-TURB) is performed in 25-75% of low-risk and 55-98% of high-risk patients. Between 21% and 88% of patients received a single instillation of chemotherapy within 24h after TURB. Adjuvant intravesical treatment is not given to 6-62%, 2-33%, and 1-20% of the patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk NMIBC, respectively. Patients with low-risk NMIBC are likely to be overmonitored and those with high-risk NMIBC undermonitored. Our study is limited by the possible recall bias of the selected physicians.  Conclusions:   Although most European physicians claim to apply the EAU guidelines, adherence to them is low in daily practice.  Patient summary:   Our survey among European physicians investigated discrepancies between guidelines and daily practice in the management of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We conclude that the use of the recommended diagnostic tools, risk-stratification of NMIBC, and performance of re-TURB have been adopted, but adjuvant intravesical treatment and follow-up are not uniformly applied.""","""['Kees Hendricksen', 'Atiqullah Aziz', 'Perrine Bes', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Jakub Dobruch', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Andrea Necchi', 'Aidan P Noon', 'Bas W G van Rhijn', 'Michael Rink', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Roland Seiler', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Brian Qvick', 'Marek Babjuk', 'Evanguelos Xylinas;Young Academic Urologists Urothelial Carcinoma Group of the European Association of Urology']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['EAU Guidelines on Non-Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder: Update 2016.', 'European Association of Urology Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (TaT1 and Carcinoma In Situ) - 2019 Update.', 'European Association of Urology Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (Ta, T1, and Carcinoma in Situ).', 'EAU guidelines on non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: update 2013.', 'Current clinical practice gaps in the treatment of intermediate- and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with emphasis on the use of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG): results of an international individual patient data survey (IPDS).', 'Audit, Feedback, and Education to Improve Quality and Outcomes in Transurethral Resection and Single-Instillation Intravesical Chemotherapy for Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Treatment: Protocol for a Multicenter International Observational Study With an Embedded Cluster Randomized Trial.', 'Guidance of adjuvant instillation in intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer by drug screens in patient derived organoids: a single center, open-label, phase II trial.', 'Role of Intravesical BCG as a Therapeutic Vaccine for Treatment of Bladder Carcinoma.', 'Photodynamic versus white-light-guided resection of first-diagnosis non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: PHOTO RCT.', 'Addition of Chromosome 17 Polysomy and HER2 Amplification Status Improves the Accuracy of Clinicopathological Factor-Based Progression Risk Stratification and Tumor Grading of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.']"""
