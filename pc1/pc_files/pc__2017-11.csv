A cohort of nine children, aged 2-14 years, who received 3D conformal radiotherapy for low-grade localized brain tumors (LBTs), were randomly selected for this study. The extent of these patients' computed tomography simulation image sets were cranial only. To approximate their missing anatomy, we supplemented the LBT patients' image sets with computed tomography images of patients in a previous study with larger extents of matched sex, height, and mass and for whom contours of organs at risk for radiogenic cancer had already been delineated. Rigid fusion was performed between the LBT patients' data and that of the supplemental computational phantoms using commercial software and in-house codes. In-field dose was calculated with a clinically commissioned treatment planning system, and out-of-field dose was estimated with a previously developed analytical model that was re-fit with parameters based on new measurements for intracranial radiotherapy. Mean doses greater than 1 Gy were found in the red bone marrow, remainder, thyroid, and skin of the patients in this study. Mean organ doses between 150 mGy and 1 Gy were observed in the breast tissue of the girls and lungs of all patients. Distant organs, i.e. prostate, bladder, uterus, and colon, received mean organ doses less than 150 mGy. The mean organ doses of the younger, smaller LBT patients (0-4 years old) were a factor of 2.4 greater than those of the older, larger patients (8-12 years old). Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of a straightforward method of applying supplemental computational phantoms and dose-calculation models to estimate absorbed dose for a set of children of various ages who received radiotherapy and for whom anatomies were largely missing in their original computed tomography simulations.""","""['Kyle J Gallagher', 'Jaad Tannous', 'Racile Nabha', 'Joelle Ann Feghali', 'Zeina Ayoub', 'Wassim Jalbout', 'Bassem Youssef', 'Phillip J Taddei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Toward automated and personalized organ dose determination in CT examinations - A comparison of two tissue characterization models for Monte Carlo organ dose calculation with a Therapy Planning System.', 'Feasibility and accuracy of UF/NCI phantoms and Monte Carlo retrospective dosimetry in children treated on National Wilms Tumor Study protocols.', 'Organ doses evaluation for chest computed tomography procedures with TL dosimeters: Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Conformal radiotherapy of brain tumors.', 'Determination of target volume in pediatric radiotherapy: application to brain tumors.', 'Analytical models for external photon beam radiotherapy out-of-field dose calculation: a scoping review.', 'Proton Radiotherapy Could Reduce the Risk of Fatal Second Cancers for Children with Intracranial Tumors in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.', 'ANALYTICAL MODEL TO ESTIMATE EQUIVALENT DOSE FROM INTERNAL NEUTRONS IN PROTON THERAPY OF CHILDREN WITH INTRACRANIAL TUMORS.']"""

Here, the synthesis, radiolabeling, and in vitro and in vivo characterization of two 68Ga-radiolabeled Glu-NH-C(O)-NH-Lys radiotracers conjugated to the desferrioxamine B (DFO) chelate were evaluated. Two linker groups based on amide bond and thiourea coupling chemistries were employed to develop 68Ga-DFO-Nsucc-PSMA (68Ga-4) and 68Ga-DFO- pNCS-Bn-PSMA (68Ga-7), respectively. Radiosynthesis proceeded quantitatively at room temperature with high radiochemical yields, chemical/radiochemical purities, and specific activities. Pharmacokinetic profiles of 68Ga-4 and 68Ga-7 were assessed using positron-emission tomography (PET) in mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP tumors. Data were compared to the current clinical benchmark radiotracer 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (68Ga-1) (HBED = N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxy-5-(ethylene-beta-carboxy)benzyl)ethylenediamine N,N'-diacetic acid). Results indicated that the target binding affinity, protein association, blood pool and background organ clearance properties, and uptake in PSMA-positive lesions are strongly dependent on the nature of the chelate, the linker, and the spacer groups. Protein dissociation constants ( Kd values) were found to be predictive of pharmacokinetics in vivo. Compared to 68Ga-1, 68Ga-4 and 68Ga-7 resulted in decreased tumor uptake but enhanced blood pool clearance and reduced residence time in the kidney.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in acute toxicity among patients with localized PCa treated with either conventional fractionated proton therapy (CFPT) or HFPT.  Methods:   A total of 526 eligible patients treated with proton therapy between February 2013 and May 2016 in three phase II trials were analyzed. We prescribed 74 gray relative biological effectiveness equivalents [Gy (RBE)]/37 fractions for low-risk patients and 78 Gy (RBE)/39 fractions for intermediate- and high-risk patients in the CFPT group (n = 254) and 60 Gy (RBE)/20 fractions for low-risk and 63 Gy (RBE)/21 fractions for intermediate- and high-risk patients in the HFPT group (n = 272). Patients were evaluated for acute toxicity with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and urinary quality-of-life change using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).  Results:   No grade ‚â•3 acute toxicity was observed in either group. Among acute genitourinary toxicities, grade 2 rates were 15% (n = 38) in CFPT and 5.9% (n = 16) in HFPT (P ‚â§ 0.001).

To overcome this problem, researchers have evaluated the efficacy of DTX treatment in combination with other drugs. Naftopidil is a tubulin-binding drug with fewer adverse events, implying the usefulness of this drug in clinical applications when combined with DTX. Here, we investigated the efficacy of additive naftopidil treatment in combination with DTX on prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   The effects of combination treatment with DTX plus naftopidil were analyzed using two animal models of LNCaP cells plus PrSC xenografts (sub-renal capsule grafting) and PC-3 xenografts (intratibial injection).  Results:   Combination treatment with DTX plus naftopidil significantly inhibited cell growth in LNCaP cells compared with DTX alone. Analysis of the cooperativity index (CI) showed that combination treatment exhibited additive effects on DTX-induced growth inhibition in LNCaP cells. In contrast, combination treatment showed more than an additive (synergistic) effect on DTX-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells plus PrSC xenografts, combination treatment showed synergistic effects on DTX-induced apoptosis. The synergistic effects of naftopidil on DTX-induced apoptosis were also observed in PC-3 xenografts.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that additive naftopidil treatment in combination with DTX increased the efficacy of DTX for the treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 tumors in vivo. Thus, additive naftopidil treatment showed a synergistic effect on DTX-induced apoptosis in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this treatment approach may yield improved clinical benefits compared with DTX alone.""","""['Kenichiro Ishii', 'Izumi Matsuoka', 'Shinya Kajiwara', 'Takeshi Sasaki', 'Manabu Miki', 'Manabu Kato', 'Hideki Kanda', 'Kiminobu Arima', 'Taizo Shiraishi', 'Yoshiki Sugimura']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Drug Repositioning of the Œ±1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?', 'Bcl-2 family inhibition sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and promotes unexpected apoptosis under caspase-9 inhibition.', 'Combination treatment with naftopidil increases the efficacy of radiotherapy in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Naftopidil, a selective {alpha}1-adrenoceptor antagonist, suppresses human prostate tumor growth by altering interactions between tumor cells and stroma.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Repurposed Drugs in Gastric Cancer.', 'Drug Repositioning of the Œ±1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?', 'TGF-Œ≤ causes Docetaxel resistance in Prostate Cancer via the induction of Bcl-2 by acetylated KLF5 and Protein Stabilization.', 'Bim, Puma and Noxa upregulation by Naftopidil sensitizes ovarian cancer to the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and the MEK inhibitor Trametinib.', 'Loss of Fibroblast-Dependent Androgen Receptor Activation in Prostate Cancer Cells is Involved in the Mechanism of Acquired Resistance to Castration.']"""

Our study analyzed the effects of ANP in combination with 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) and antiestrogen treatments on p53 and ERŒ± levels in T-47D breast cancer cells. Preliminary studies through Western blot analysis showed that ANP treatment decreases p53 and ERŒ± expression levels in a concentration-dependent (10-100 nM) manner. Treatment with ANP alone, at a 100 nM concentration, causes a decrease of p53 and ERŒ± expression compared with Cs (control stripped), but with E2 and antiestrogen combinations, expression of both protein levels decreased compared with treatments without ANP. Combined treatment with E2, an estrogen antagonist, and ANP decreased cellular proliferation compared with treatments without ANP, except in the case of raloxifene (RAL).

Whereas the resource and time cost required in traditional biology experiments are expensive, more and more attentions have been paid to the development of effective and feasible computational methods for predicting potential associations between disease and miRNA. In this study, we developed a computational model of Hybrid Approach for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (HAMDA), which involved the hybrid graph-based recommendation algorithm, to reveal novel miRNA-disease associations by integrating experimentally verified miRNA-disease associations, disease semantic similarity, miRNA functional similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity into a recommendation algorithm. HAMDA took not only network structure and information propagation but also node attribution into consideration, resulting in a satisfactory prediction performance. Specifically, HAMDA obtained AUCs of 0.9035 and 0.8395 in the frameworks of global and local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. Meanwhile, HAMDA also achieved good performance with AUC of 0.8965 ¬± 0.0012 in 5-fold cross validation. Additionally, we conducted case studies about three important human cancers for performance evaluation of HAMDA. As a result, 90% (Lymphoma), 86% (Prostate Cancer) and 92% (Kidney Cancer) of top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by recent experiment literature, which showed the reliable prediction ability of HAMDA.""","""['Xing Chen', 'Ya-Wei Niu', 'Guang-Hui Wang', 'Gui-Ying Yan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biomed Inform""","""['PBMDA: A novel and effective path-based computational model for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'A novel computational model based on super-disease and miRNA for potential miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Review of MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction.', 'Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations based on more reliable negative sample selection.', 'Inferring human miRNA-disease associations via multiple kernel fusion on GCNII.', 'A novel information diffusion method based on network consistency for identifying disease related microRNAs.', 'LSGSP: a novel miRNA-disease association prediction model using a Laplacian score of the graphs and space projection federated method.', 'PMDFI: Predicting miRNA-Disease Associations Based on High-Order Feature Interaction.']"""

Therefore, it is highly advantageous to identify and develop inhibitors targeting Smad3 linker phosphorylation for the treatment of cancers. Galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) has been known to be an active flavonoid showing a cytotoxic effect on several cancer cells. However, the mechanism of action of galangin in various cancers remains unclear, and there has been no report concerning regulation of Smad3 phosphorylation by galangin. In the present study, we show that galangin significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in the presence of TGF-Œ≤1 in both human prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Methods:   HRQoL, OS and rPFS were assessed in phase III trials comparing enzalutamide with placebo in chemotherapy-na√Øve (PREVAIL; NCT01212991) or post-chemotherapy (AFFIRM; NCT00974311) mCRPC. HRQoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). Multivariate analyses evaluated the prognostic significance of baseline and time-dependent scores after adjusting for treatment and clinical/demographic variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) represented the hazard of rPFS or OS per minimally important difference (MID) score change in HRQoL variables.  Results:   In baseline and time-dependent multivariate analyses, OS was independently associated with multiple HRQoL measures across both studies. In time-dependent analyses, a 10-point (upper bound of MID range) increase (improvement) in FACT-P total score was associated with reductions in mortality risk of 19% in AFFIRM (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.78-0.84]) and 21% in PREVAIL (HR 0.79 [0.76-0.83]). For baseline analyses, a 10-point increase in FACT-P total score was associated with reductions in mortality risk of 12% (HR 0.88 [0.84-0.93]) and 10% (HR 0.90 [0.86-0.95]) in AFFIRM and PREVAIL, respectively. rPFS was associated with a subset of HRQoL domains in both studies.

The serum prostate-specific antigen level test has been widely used to screen for PC. This method, however, exhibits a high false-positive rate, leading to over-diagnosis and over-treatment of PC patients. Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) recently provided valuable information including the site and the status of the cancers and thus emerged as new biomarkers for several cancers. Among them, miR141 and miR375 are the most pronounced biomarkers for the diagnosis of high-risk PC. Herein, we report an attomolar detection of miR141 and miR375 released from living PC cells by using a plasmonic nanowire interstice (PNI) sensor. This sensor showed a very low detection limit of 100 aM as well as a wide dynamic range from 100 aM to 100 pM for all target miRNAs. In addition, the PNI sensor could discriminate perfectly the diverse single-base mismatches in the miRNAs. More importantly, the PNI sensor successfully detected the extracellular miR141 and miR375 released from living PC cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3), proving the diagnostic ability of the sensor for PC. We anticipate that the present PNI sensor can hold great promise for the precise diagnosis and prognosis of various cancer patients as well as PC patients.""","""['Siyeong Yang', 'Hongki Kim', 'Kyung Jin Lee', 'Seul Gee Hwang', 'Eun-Kyung Lim', 'Juyeon Jung', 'Tae Jae Lee', 'Hee-Sung Park', 'Taejoon Kang', 'Bongsoo Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Ultra-specific zeptomole microRNA detection by plasmonic nanowire interstice sensor with Bi-temperature hybridization.', 'Precisely Determining Ultralow level UO2(2+) in Natural Water with Plasmonic Nanowire Interstice Sensor.', 'MicroRNAs as Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis and Theranostics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of microRNA signature and potential pathway targets in prostate cancer.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Metal Nanoparticles-Enhanced Biosensors: Synthesis, Design and Applications in Fluorescence Enhancement and Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering.', 'Detection of Marker miRNAs, Associated with Prostate Cancer, in Plasma Using SOI-NW Biosensor in Direct and Inversion Modes.', 'Electrochemical Characteristics of a DNA Modified Electrode as a Function of Percent Binding.']"""

Data on each patient's PSA level, biopsy GS, cT stage, presence of Gleason pattern 5, presence of IDC-P, percentage of the core involved with cancer, and maximum percentage of the core involved with cancer were analyzed.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 108 months (range, 11-257 months). Forty-eight patients (24%) showed disease progression. Thirty-four patients (17%) died of the disease during follow-up. The IDC-P component was detected in 74 (36%) needle biopsy samples. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSS rates of the IDC-P-negative cases were 3.2%, 9.0%, and 23.7%; the corresponding rates of the IDC-P-positive cases were 23.9%, 33.7%, and 52.7%, respectively (P = 0.0001). In the Fine and Gray's model for PFS, IDC-P, maximum percentage of the core involved with cancer, and cT stage were significantly associated (P = 0.013, P = 0.003, P = 0.007). In the Fine and Gray's model for CSS, only IDC-P was significant (P = 0.027). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, IDC-P (P = 0.04; hazard ratio [HR], 1.95) and maximum percentage of the core involved with cancer (P = 0.021; HR, 0.43) were significant factors in predicting overall survival (OS).  Conclusions:   The presence of IDC-P in a needle biopsy was a prognostic factor for PFS, CSS, and OS in patients with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Multimodal pre-and/or post- surgical therapy may be needed when IDC-P is found in a needle biopsy specimen.""","""['Masashi Kato', 'Kyosuke Kimura', 'Akihiro Hirakawa', 'Yumiko Kobayashi', 'Ryo Ishida', 'Osamu Kamihira', 'Tsuyoshi Majima', 'Yasuhito Funahashi', 'Naoto Sassa', 'Yoshihisa Matsukawa', 'Ryohei Hattori', 'Momokazu Gotoh', 'Toyonori Tsuzuki']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prognostic value of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Is there any prognostic impact of intraductal carcinoma of prostate in initial diagnosed aggressively metastatic prostate cancer?', 'Response of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate to androgen deprivation therapy predicts prostate cancer prognosis in radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: What we know and what we do not know.', 'Leukocytic Infiltration of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: An Exploratory Study.', 'Clinical significance of IDC-P as predictive factor after intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic factors in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA) VALUES IN PATIENTS WITH LOW- AND HIGH-RISK PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.']"""

Best practice of those expensive drugs requires predictive biomarker monitoring. This study used circulating biomarker analysis to follow cancer-derived transcripts implicated in therapy resistance.  Method:   The isolated platelet population of blood samples and digital-PCR were used to identify selected biomarker transcripts in patients with CRPC prior chemo- or androgen synthesis inhibiting therapy.  Results:   Fifty patients received either docetaxel (n = 24) or abiraterone (n = 26) therapy, with therapy response rates of 54% and 48%, respectively. Transcripts for the PC-associated biomarkers kallikrein-related peptidase-2 and -3 (KLK2, KLK3), folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1), and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) were uniquely present within the platelet fraction of cancer patients and not detected in healthy controls (n = 15). In the abiraterone treated cohort, the biomarkers provided information on therapy outcome, demonstrating an association between detectable biomarkers and short progression free survival (PFS) (FOLH1, P < 0.01; KLK3, P < 0.05; and NPY, P < 0.05). Patients with biomarker-negative platelets had the best outcome, while FOLH1 (P < 0.05) and NPY (P = 0.05) biomarkers provided independent predictive information in a multivariate analysis regarding PFS. KLK2 (P < 0.01), KLK3 (P < 0.001), and FOLH1 (P < 0.05) biomarkers were associated with short overall survival (OS). Combining three biomarkers in a panel (KLK3, FOLH1, and NPY) made it possible to separate long-term responders from short-term responders with 87% sensitivity and 82% specificity.  Conclusion:   Analyzing tumor-derived biomarkers in platelets of CRPC patients enabled prediction of the outcome after abiraterone therapy with higher accuracy than baseline serum PSA or PSA response.""","""['Lee-Ann Tjon-Kon-Fat', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Mona Schr√∂der', 'Thomas Wurdinger', 'Camilla Thellenberg-Karlsson', 'Anders Widmark', 'Pernilla Wikstr√∂m', 'Rolf Jonas Andreas Nilsson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Liquid biopsy reveals KLK3 mRNA as a prognostic marker for progression free survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing first-line abiraterone acetate and prednisone treatment.', 'Choice of new drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer: predictive factors and effectiveness assessment.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Tumor educated platelet: the novel BioSource for cancer detection.', 'Current Applications of Liquid Biopsy in Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease-From Early Cancer Detection to Individualized Cancer Treatment.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Blood platelets as an RNA biomarker platform for neuro-oncological diseases.', 'Liquid Biopsy Based Circulating Biomarkers in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

The dysregulation of metabolism and autophagy contributes to the progression of PCa. The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is implicated in the regulation of metabolism and autophagy. We confirmed that Sp1 is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. However, the roles of Sp1 in PCa metabolism and autophagy remain unclear. Thus, in the present study, we retrieved the GSE35988 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to reinvestigate Sp1 expression and its role in PCa.We found that in PCa, Sp1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth, aerobic glycolysis, and hypoxia-induced autophagy, which were accompanied by an increased G1 cell cycle arrest. Pearson correlation indicated that pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) is positively correlated with Sp1 expression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Sp1 directly regulates PKM2; therefore, Sp1 modulates metabolism and autophagy in CRPC. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay also indicated that the tumor suppressor miR-361-5p inversely regulates Sp1 by directly targeting the binding site in the 3'UTR of Sp1. miR-361-5p overexpression presented effects that are similar to Sp1 depletion in PCa. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that miR-361-5p suppresses the Sp1/PKM2 axis, consequently affecting the progression of PCa and the metabolism and autophagy of PCa cells. Therefore, targeting the miR-361-5p/Sp1/PKM2 pathway has considerable clinical significance in preventing the malignant progression of PCa.""","""['Zhixin Ling', 'Dachuang Liu', 'Guangyuan Zhang', 'Qing Liang', 'Ping Xiang', 'Yan Xu', 'Conghui Han', 'Tao Tao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['miR-625-5p/PKM2 negatively regulates melanoma glycolysis state.', 'Oviductus ranae protein hydrolysate (ORPH) inhibits the growth, metastasis and glycolysis of HCC by targeting miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis.', 'MiR-139-5p is associated with poor prognosis and regulates glycolysis by repressing PKM2 in gallbladder carcinoma.', 'PKM2 contributes to cancer metabolism.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Potassium Channels, Glucose Metabolism and Glycosylation in Cancer Cells.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Small-Molecule Modulators Targeting Metabolic Pathways in Cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'TGF-Œ≤RII regulates glucose metabolism in oral cancer-associated fibroblasts via promoting PKM2 nuclear translocation.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data on PCa incident cases and deaths in 1995-2014 were obtained from the Estonian Cancer Registry and the Causes of Death Registry, respectively. Joinpoint regression was used to estimate the annual percentage change for incidence and mortality trends. Relative survival ratios (RSRs) were calculated for four 5 year periods. Incidence and survival were analyzed by age and stage.  Results:   The average annual number of new PCa cases in Estonia increased more than three-fold from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014. The age-standardized overall incidence and the incidence of localized cancer increased steeply until 2011, then leveled off. The incidence of locally/regionally spread or distant PCa remained stable. A significant increase in PCa mortality was seen only in men aged 65 years and older. The overall 5 year RSR increased from 58% to 90% over the study period. Survival increased considerably for all stages.  Conclusions:   The dramatic rise in the incidence of PCa in Estonia since the late 1990s was limited to localized cancers. This, together with rapid increases in survival, is probably due predominantly to extensive opportunistic prostate-specific antigen testing of middle-aged and elderly men. The ongoing increase in PCa mortality among older men warrants validation of causes of death to avoid possible overestimation.

In the present study, we sought to determine the function of miR-323 in prostate cancer cell growth and response to docetaxel. The effects of miR-323 overexpression on prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis were examined. We also investigated the impact of miR-323 knockdown on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Ectopic expression of miR-323 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Depletion of miR-323 arrested PC-3 prostate cancer cells at the G0/G1 phase and caused significant apoptosis, which was coupled with increased expression of p21 and cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and reduced expression of cyclin D1. Compared to PC-3 parental cells, docetaxel-resistant PC-3-DR cells had 5.6-fold higher levels of miR-323. Overexpression of miR-323 increased the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for docetaxel in PC-3 cells, while silencing of miR-323 exerted an opposite effect on PC-3-DR cells. Mechanistically, miR-323 repressed the expression of p73 in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of p73 augmented cell proliferation and colony formation and blunted sensitivity to docetaxel in PC-3 cells. In addition, overexpression of p73 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and docetaxel sensitivity in PC-3-DR cells.

Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a membrane-anchored Serine/Threonine kinase involved in endosomal protein trafficking and androgen signaling amongst other processes. Previous studies have shown this protein to be of therapeutic importance in cystic fibrosis and prostate cancer. However, nothing is known about the endogenous expression of this protein and its regulation. In this study, we analyzed the gene encoding human LMTK2, to look for possible regulatory elements that could affect its expression. Interestingly, the human lmtk2 gene contains a consensus TPA (12- O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-responsive element (TRE) in the region preceding its start codon. The element with the sequence TGAGTCA modulates LMTK2 expression in response to treatment with TPA, a synthetic Protein Kinase C (PKC) activator. It serves as the binding site for c-Fos, a member of the Activator Protein -1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, which is transactivated by PKC. We observed that TPA, at low concentrations, increases the promoter activity of LMTK2, which leads to a subsequent increase in the mRNA transcript and protein levels. This modulation occurs through binding of the AP-1 transcription factor complex to the lmtk2 promoter. Thus, our current study has established LMTK2 as a TPA-responsive element-containing gene, which is upregulated downstream of PKC activation. Considering the involvement of LMTK2 in intracellular processes as well as pathological conditions, our findings demonstrate a way to modulate intracellular LMTK2 levels pharmacologically for potentially therapeutic purposes.""","""['Isha Dey', 'Neil A Bradbury']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Rep""","""['Unraveling the Function of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 Network.', 'Transcriptional modulation of the human complement factor I gene in Hep G2 cells by protein kinase C activation.', 'Transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 by phorbol ester in human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH involves jun- and fos-containing activator protein 1 site binding complex(es).', 'Involvement of protein kinase C in the transcriptional regulation of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible genes modulated by AP-1 or non-AP-1 transacting factors.', 'The alpha and eta isoforms of protein kinase C stimulate transcription of human involucrin gene.', 'Lemur Tyrosine Kinases and Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'LMTK2 as Potential Biomarker for Stratification between Clinically Insignificant and Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', ""Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) Level Inversely Correlates with Phospho-Tau in Neuropathological Stages of Alzheimer's Disease."", ""Neuropathological characterization of Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) in Alzheimer's disease and neocortical Lewy body disease."", 'Unraveling the Function of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 Network.']"""

Evaluation of 11C-acetate biodistribution in human parenchymal organs is described.  Methods and materials:   60 consecutive patients referred to 11C-acetate PET CT suspected of renal or prostate cancer relapse with negative results (no recurrent tumor) were included in the study. Acquisition from the base of skull to upper thigh was made 20 min after i.v. injection of 720 MBq of 11C-acetate. The distribution was evaluated by measuring the uptake in pancreas (uncinate process and body separately), liver, spleen, and left suprarenal gland. Clinical data of included patients showed no abnormalities in these organs.  Results:   Biodistributions of 11C-acetate radiotracer were compared in different organs. Standardized uptake values of 11C-acetate were significantly higher in pancreatic parenchyma (SUV mean 6,4) than in liver (SUV mean 3,3), spleen (SUV mean 4,5), or suprarenal gland (SUV mean 2,7) tissues. No significant difference was found between pancreatic head (SUV mean 6,4) and body (SUV mean 5,9) uptake. In case of all aforementioned organs, there were no differences either between both sexes or between formerly diagnosed tumors (renal and prostate).  Conclusions:   Evaluation of 11C-acetate uptake differences in parenchymal organs will allow establishing normal patterns of distribution.

To date PCa xenotransplantation studies in zebrafish have not been performed in the presence of testosterone, even when employing androgen-dependent cell models, such as the LNCaP cell line. Thus, with the goal of more faithfully modelling the hormonal milieu in which PCa develops in humans, we sought to determine the effects of exogenous testosterone on the growth of LNCaP, or androgen-independent C4-2 cells xenografted into zebrafish embryos. Testosterone significantly increased engrafted LNCaP proliferation compared to control xenografts, which could be inhibited by co-administration of the anti-androgen receptor drug, enzalutamide. By contrast, C4-2 cell growth was not affected by either testosterone or enzalutamide. Enzalutamide also induced bradycardia and death in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and strongly synergized with the potassium-channel blocking agent, terfenadine, known to induce long QT syndrome and cardiac arrhythmia. Together, these data not only indicate that testosterone administration should be considered in all PCa xenograft studies in zebrafish but also highlights the unique opportunity of this preclinical platform to simultaneously evaluate efficacy and toxicity of novel therapies and/or protective agents towards developing safer and more effective PCa treatments.""","""['Nicole Melong', 'Shelby Steele', 'Morgan MacDonald', 'Alice Holly', 'Colin C Collins', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Jason N Berman', 'Graham Dellaire']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A Novel Small Molecule Inhibits Tumor Growth and Synergizes Effects of Enzalutamide on Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, induces tumor regression in a mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced radiosensitization of enzalutamide via schedule dependent administration to androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'A chemical probe for BAG1 targets androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer through oxidative stress signaling pathway.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Hypogonadism and Cardiovascular Toxicity in Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving the sexual activity and reproduction of female zebrafish with high testosterone levels.', 'The use of zebrafish model in prostate cancer therapeutic development and discovery.', 'Antiangiogenic molecules from marine actinomycetes and the importance of using zebrafish model in cancer research.']"""

TRX1 inhibition via shRNA or a phase I-approved inhibitor, PX-12 (untested in prostate cancer), impedes the growth of CRPC cells to a greater extent than their androgen-dependent counterparts. TRX1 inhibition elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 levels and cell death in androgen-deprived CRPC cells. Unexpectedly, TRX1 inhibition also elevates androgen receptor (AR) levels under AD, and AR depletion mitigates both TRX1 inhibition-mediated ROS production and cell death, suggesting that AD-resistant AR expression in CRPC induces redox vulnerability.

BPH is characterized by an enlargement of prostate tissue associated with increased tone of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) which surround the single glands composing the prostate. Secretions of the glands leave the prostate through local excretory ducts during the emission phase of ejaculation. Pharmacological treatment of BPH suggests different local drug targets based on reduction of prostate smooth muscle tone as the main effect and disturbed ejaculation as a common side effect. This highlights the need for detailed investigation of single prostate glands and ducts. We combined structural and functional imaging techniques-notably, clear lipid-exchanged, acrylamide-hybridized rigid imaging/immunostaining/ in situ hybridization-compatible tissue-hydrogel (CLARITY) and time-lapse imaging-and defined glands and ducts as distinct SMC compartments in human and rat prostate tissue. The single glands of the prostate (comprising the secretory part) are characterized by spontaneous contractions mediated by the surrounding SMCs, whereas the ducts (excretory part) are quiescent. In both SMC compartments, phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 is expressed. PDE5 inhibitors have recently emerged as alternative treatment options for BPH. We directly visualized that the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil act by reducing spontaneous contractility of the glands, thereby reducing the muscle tone of the organ. In contrast, the ductal (excretory) system and thus the prostate's contribution to ejaculation is unaffected by PDE5 inhibitors. Our differentiated imaging approach reveals new details about prostate function and local drug actions and thus may support clinical management of BPH.-K√ºgler, R., Mietens, A., Seidensticker, M., Tasch, S., Wagenlehner, F.

Secondary outcomes based on cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology were also examined.Results There was little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations were 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.10) for colorectal cancer, 1.05 (0.89 to 1.24) for breast cancer, 0.89 (0.77 to 1.02) for prostate cancer, and 1.03 (0.87 to 1.23) for lung cancer. The results were consistent with the two different analytical approaches, and the study was powered to detect relative effect sizes of moderate magnitude (for example, 1.20-1.50 per 25 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D for most primary cancer outcomes. The Mendelian randomisation assumptions did not seem to be violated.Conclusions There is little evidence for a linear causal association between circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of various types of cancer, though the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude cannot be ruled out.

This study evaluated the association of prostate cancer diagnosis with vitamin D levels as well as with each of the following variables of interest: age, race group, military service, smoking status, and alcohol use.  Methods:   A total of 11,547 adult males aged 18 or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for years 2001-2010 were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is an annual, nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized civilian adult and child residents of the United States. Active duty military are excluded from the survey. Subjects were excluded if they answered ""don't know"" or ""refused"" to vitamin D or prostate cancer survey questions. œá2 analyses were performed to analyze associations between diagnosis of prostate cancer and variables of interest. The military service variable was developed on the basis of the response to survey question ""Did you ever serve in the Armed Forces of the United States?"" A multivariable logistic regression model included all the variables of interest that were available in the database. All analyses were appropriately weighted for extrapolation to average annual population-based estimates for the years included in the study.  Results:   Two percent had a diagnosis of prostate cancer, whereas 72% had less than 75 nmol/L of vitamin D. Unadjusted œá2 test results suggested those with a vitamin D level of <75 nmol/L, <65 years of age and consuming at least one alcoholic drink per day were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer although smokers and those with military service were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, after adjusting for covariates included in the multivariable logistic regression model, only the following covariates remained significant: men <65 years old were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.12), although those with military service and non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.09-2.53 and OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.28-2.33, respectively). No other factors in the model, including vitamin D level, retained significance.

Adjustments of the voltage settings aimed at higher cancer cell purity in the central outlet provided 0.72% cancer cell purity and 1445-fold enrichment that resulted in 62 ¬± 8.7% cancer cell recovery. Similar rates of cancer-cell recovery, cancer-cell purity, and fold-enrichment were seen with both prostate cancer (DU145, PC3) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell line cells.

The concept of the similarity comparison is that every stationary cell in every tissue constantly screens the gene expression of its neighbors. Cells process the signals, and when the difference between neighbors exceeds some threshold, a signal is triggered. An under-expressing cell then either increases its gene expression or apoptosis occurs. The oversight role of the similarity comparison can, under certain conditions, be disrupted, such that mutated cells in the tissue can survive. This is possible only when surrounding normal cells exhibit reduced gene expression.

However, little is known about the effect of declines in urinary continence and sexual function on healthcare utilization. We aim to identify these factors.  Materials and methods:   From March 2011 to September 2013, all men undergoing robotic prostatectomy within our healthcare system were enrolled. Men completed the expanded prostate cancer index composite-26 survey at the time of diagnosis and 90 days post-operatively. Patients were stratified according to change in scores in the sexual function and urinary incontinence domains. Patient, treatment and post-op utilization patterns were examined for association with the extent of decline in sexual function and urinary continence. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors independently associated with decline in continence and sexual function.  Results:   A total of 411 men who completed the baseline survey and at 90 days postoperatively were included. On multivariate linear regression, younger age (p < 0.01), higher preoperative sexual function (< 0.01), single marital status (p = 0.04) and more post-surgery email contacts (p = 0.04) were associated with higher declines in sexual function. For continence, no family history of prostate cancer (p = 0.01), higher baseline continence (p < 0.01) and more post-surgery physical therapy visits (p < 0.01) were associated with higher declines.  Conclusions:   Patients with the poorest quality of life outcomes at 90 days post-operatively were more likely to seek care via email and physical therapy encounters related to sexual function and urinary incontinence, respectively.

A number of studies have proposed that Notch signaling may be aberrantly activated, thus contributing to development, invasion and metastasis in a variety of human cancers. In the present study, the function and mechanism of Notch1 in human prostate cancer (PCa) LNCaP cells in vitro was investigated. Notch1 and cleaved-Notch1 expression were evaluated in human PCa cell lines, including LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145, and the human prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cell line. LNCaP cells were transfected with Notch1-targeting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and the level of proliferation, the ability to invade and the expression of genes associated with cancer cell invasion were subsequently investigated. Notch1 was highly expressed in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145 cells compared with RWPE-1 cells, while cleaved-Notch1 was expressed in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145 cells, and only to a minimal extent in RWPE-1 cells. Knockdown of Notch1 by shRNA in LNCaP cells markedly decreased cell invasion through Matrigel and inhibited cell proliferation 48 h following transfection. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that Notch1-knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of metastasis-associated 1 (MTA1) and increase of KiSS-1 metastasis-suppressor (KISS-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4) and cluster of differentiation 82 (KAI1). The present data demonstrated that expression of Notch1 was significantly associated with the invasion of prostate cancer. Knockdown of Notch1 decreased the invasive ability of LNCaP cells, which may be caused by downregulating MTA1 and upregulating KISS-1, MKK4 and KAI1. These findings indicated that targeting Notch1 may provide a novel method of suppressing or treating metastasis in prostate cancer.""","""['Gang Deng', 'Xiaoliang Zheng', 'Peiwu Jiang', 'Kean Chen', 'Xiaoju Wang', 'Kang Jiang', 'Wenjun Zhang', 'Linglan Tu', 'Dongmei Yan', 'Libin Ma', 'Shenglin Ma']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['S100A16 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via AKT and ERK cell signaling pathways in human prostate cancer.', 'In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'Ectopic expression of CC chemokine receptor 7 promotes prostate cancer cells metastasis via Notch1 signaling.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'KISS1 in metastatic cancer research and treatment: potential and paradoxes.', 'Role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating the anti-metastatic effect of KISS1.', 'Loss of Notch1 Activity Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis and Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Antiandrogen Therapies.', 'Expression of microRNA-99a-3p in Prostate Cancer Based on Bioinformatics Data and Meta-Analysis of a Literature Review of 965 Cases.']"""

PIM kinases are prosurvival kinases and their expression increases in hypoxia. The goal of this study was to determine whether targeting hypoxia-induced PIM kinase expression is effective in combination with VEGF-targeting agents. The rationale for this therapeutic approach is based on the fact that antiangiogenic drugs can make tumors hypoxic, and thus more sensitive to PIM inhibitors.Experimental Design: Xenograft and orthotopic models of prostate and colon cancer were used to assess the effect of PIM activation on the efficacy of VEGF-targeting agents. IHC and in vivo imaging were used to analyze angiogenesis, apoptosis, proliferation, and metastasis. Biochemical studies were performed to characterize the novel signaling pathway linking PIM and HIF1.Results: PIM was upregulated following treatment with anti-VEGF therapies, and PIM1 overexpression reduced the ability of these drugs to disrupt vasculature and block tumor growth. PIM inhibitors reduced HIF1 activity, opposing the shift to a pro-angiogenic gene signature associated with hypoxia. Combined inhibition of PIM and VEGF produced a synergistic antitumor response characterized by decreased proliferation, reduced tumor vasculature, and decreased metastasis.Conclusions: This study describes PIM kinase expression as a novel mechanism of resistance to antiangiogenic agents. Our data provide justification for combining PIM and VEGF inhibitors to treat solid tumors. The unique ability of PIM inhibitors to concomitantly target HIF1 and selectively kill hypoxic tumor cells addresses two major components of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.

GRPr proteins are highly overexpressed in several human tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). We present data from the use of 68Ga-RM2 in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa and negative findings on conventional imaging. Methods: We enrolled 32 men with BCR of PCa, who were 59-83 y old (mean ¬± SD, 68.7 ¬± 6.4 y). Imaging started at 40-69 min (mean, 50.5 ¬± 6.8 min) after injection of 133.2-151.7 MBq (mean, 140.6 ¬± 7.4 MBq) of 68Ga-RM2 using a time-of-flight-enabled simultaneous PET/MRI scanner. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted images were acquired. Results: All patients had a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (range, 0.3-119.0 ng/mL; mean, 10.1 ¬± 21.3 ng/mL) and negative findings on conventional imaging (CT or MRI, and a 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan) before enrollment. The observed 68Ga-RM2 PET detection rate was 71.8%. 68Ga-RM2 PET identified recurrent PCa in 23 of the 32 participants, whereas the simultaneous MRI scan identified findings compatible with recurrent PCa in 11 of the 32 patients. PSA velocity was 0.32 ¬± 0.59 ng/mL/y (range, 0.04-1.9 ng/mL/y) in patients with negative PET findings and 2.51 ¬± 2.16 ng/mL/y (range, 0.13-8.68 ng/mL/y) in patients with positive PET findings (P = 0.006). Conclusion:68Ga-RM2 PET can be used for assessment of GRPr expression in patients with BCR of PCa.

Setting, participants and outcome measures:   Patient-level data on PSA tests, biopsies and PCa diagnoses were obtained from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) for the years 2002 to 2011. The cumulative risks of PSA testing and of being diagnosed with PCa were estimated for the 10-year study period. Associations of a man's age, region and index of multiple deprivation with the cumulative risk of PSA testing and PCa diagnosis were investigated. Rates of biopsy and diagnosis, following a high test result, were compared with those from the programme of PSA testing in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study.  Results:   The 10-year risk of exposure to at least one PSA test in men aged 45 to 69 years in UK GP was 39.2% (95% CI 39.0 to 39.4%). The age-specific risks ranged from 25.2% for men aged 45-49 years to 53.0% for men aged 65-69 years (p for trend <0.001). For those with a PSA level ‚â•3, a test in UK GP was less likely to result in a biopsy (6%) and/or diagnosis of PCa (15%) compared with ProtecT study participants (85% and 34%, respectively).  Conclusion:   A high proportion of men aged 45-69 years undergo PSA tests in UK GP: 39% over a 10-year period.

LNCaP cell invasiveness, assessed using spheroid cultures in collagen gels in vitro, was increased by Œ≤-ionone and the effect was reversed by co-administration of gallein. LNCaP tumour cells, subcutaneously inoculated to immunodeficient mice, generated more metastases in vivo when Œ≤-ionone was applied through the skin. Furthermore, the intraperitoneal injection of gallein inhibited this increased metastasis spread.

Adherence to minimum standards was lowest on T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) for frequency resolution ‚â§0.4 mm (16.8%) and phase resolution ‚â§0.7 mm (48.6%), lowest on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for field of view (FOV) 120-220 mm (30.0%), and lowest on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging for slice thickness 3 mm (33.3%) and temporal resolution <10 s (31.5%). High b-value (‚â•1400 s/mm2) images were included in 58.0% (calculated in 25.9%). Adherence to T2WI phase resolution and DWI inter-slice gap were greater (P < .05) at 3T than at 1.5T. Adherence did not differ (P > .05) for any parameter between examinations performed with and without an endorectal coil. Adherence was greater for examinations performed at teaching facilities for T2WI slice thickness and DCE temporal resolution (P < .05). Adherence was not better for examinations performed in 2016 than in 2015 for any parameter (P > .05).  Conclusion:   Facilities' adherence to PI-RADS v2 minimum technical standards was variable, being particularly poor for T2WI frequency resolution and DCE temporal resolution. The standards warrant greater community education. Certain technical standards may be too stringent, and revisions should be considered.""","""['Steven J Esses', 'Samir S Taneja', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Assessment of the compliance with minimum acceptable technical parameters proposed by PI-RADS v2 guidelines in multiparametric prostate MRI acquisition in tertiary referral hospitals in the Republic of Turkey.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate at 1.5 versus 3.0T: A prospective comparison study of image quality.', 'T2- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 3T for the detection of prostate cancer with and without endorectal coil: An intraindividual comparison of image quality and diagnostic performance.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'PI-RADS: what is new and how to use it.', 'The added value of AI-based computer-aided diagnosis in classification of cancer at prostate MRI.', 'Oncologic Imaging and Radiomics: A Walkthrough Review of Methodological Challenges.', 'Better Image Quality for Diffusion-weighted MRI of the Prostate Using Deep Learning.', 'Deep learning-based artificial intelligence applications in prostate MRI: brief summary.', 'Prostate MRI quality: a critical review of the last 5 years and the role of the PI-QUAL score.']"""

Recent results demonstrated that LOX-1, a receptor associated with obesity and atherosclerosis, is overexpressed in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, high levels of oxLDL, the main ligand for LOX-1, have been found in patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, the role of LOX-1 in prostate cancer has not been unraveled completely yet. Here, we show that LOX-1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and its activation by oxLDL promotes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, through of lowered expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and plakoglobin) and an increased expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin, snail, slug, MMP-2 and MMP-9). Consequently, LOX-1 activation by oxLDL promotes actin cytoskeleton restructuration and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity inducing prostate cancer cell invasion and migration. Additionally, LOX-1 increased the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells and its expression was necessary for tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that oxLDL/LOX-1 could be ones of mechanisms that explain why obese patients with prostate cancer have an accelerated tumor progression and a greater probability of developing metastasis.""","""['I Gonz√°lez-Chavarr√≠a', 'E Fernandez', 'N Gutierrez', 'E E Gonz√°lez-Horta', 'F Sandoval', 'P Cifuentes', 'C Castillo', 'R Cerro', 'O Sanchez', 'Jorge R Toledo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-Œ∫B and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 is an enhancer of tumor angiogenesis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) promotes EMT, growth, and invasion in canine prostate cancer.', 'LOX-1 and cancer: an indissoluble liaison.', 'Role of epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-Œ∫B and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Loxin Reduced the Inflammatory Response in the Liver and the Aortic Fatty Streak Formation in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet.', 'Ox-LDL-mediated ILF3 overexpression in gastric cancer progression by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Expression of Serum sLOX-1 in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Its Correlation with Lipid Metabolism.', 'Involvement of LDL and ox-LDL in Cancer Development and Its Therapeutical Potential.']"""

Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective, multicenter, single arm study in patients with unilateral low/intermediate risk prostate cancer who were treated from April 2013 through March 2016 in Germany in AUO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Urologische Onkologie) Study Protocol AP 68/11. Unilateral prostate cancer was assessed by transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Hemiablation was done using the Ablatherm¬Æ or the Focal One¬Æ device. The oncologic outcome was assessed by the salvage treatment rate, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and rebiopsy at 12 months. Functional outcome, quality of life, anxiety and depression were measured by validated questionnaires at baseline and every 3 months.  Results:   Of the 54 recruited patients 51 completed 12-month or greater visits. Mean ¬± SD followup was 17.4 ¬± 4.5 months. Mean prostate specific antigen decreased from 6.2 ¬± 2.0 to 2.9 ¬± 1.9 ng/ml at 12 months (p <0.001). Biopsy at 12 months was positive for any prostate cancer and for clinically significant prostate cancer in 13 (26.5%) and 4 (8.2%) of the 49 patients, respectively. Posttreatment multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging had limited 25% sensitivity for clinically significant prostate cancer. Ten patients (19.6%) underwent salvage treatment. Potency was maintained in 21 of the 30 men who were potent preoperatively. There was no increase in incontinence. Quality of life, anxiety and depression did not change postoperatively. The study was limited by a short followup and the lack of a control arm.  Conclusions:   Focal therapy hemiablation is safe with little alteration of functional outcome. The oncologic outcome is acceptable on short-term followup. Followup multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging performed poorly and should not replace repeat biopsy. Focal therapy has no impact on posttreatment anxiety and depression.""","""['Roman Ganzer', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Sascha Pahernik', 'Daniel Koch', 'Daniel Baumunk', 'Timur Kuru', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg', 'Martin Schostak', 'Andreas Blana']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Targeted Hemiablation for Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Evaluation of Oncologic and Functional Outcomes.', 'Focal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound of Unilateral Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multicentric Hemiablation Study of 111 Patients.', 'Extensive Histological Sampling following Focal Therapy of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.', 'High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'Prediction and Mapping of Intraprostatic Tumor Extent with Artificial Intelligence.', 'Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsy to determine potential candidates for focal therapy.', 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.', 'Value of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy to select patients for focal therapy.', 'Boosting the Immune Response-Combining Local and Immune Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Methods:   Patients with metastatic cancer completed a questionnaire that assessed patients' willingness to consider research biopsies. Research biopsies were divided into two groups: biopsies performed as stand-alone procedures (research purposes only biopsy, RPOB) or performed during a clinically indicated biopsy (additional pass biopsy, APB). Factors analyzed included biopsy timing, biopsy site, sociodemographic information and information about prior trial participation. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using random-effects logistic regression.  Results:   One hundred and sixty-five patients with cancer (40 melanoma, 37 colorectal, 32 breast, 30 lung, 26 prostate) completed the questionnaire. Patients with melanoma demonstrated the greatest willingness to consider a research biopsy compared to patients with other cancer types (P < 0.05). Patients' ethnicity, time since previous biopsies, time since metastatic diagnosis, and previous trial enrolment were all statistically significant for willingness to consider a research biopsy on univariate analysis. When adjusting for statistically significant variables on univariate analysis, the odds of patients considering APBs were 14.6 times greater than RPOBs (P < 0.0001). Patients were also more willing to consider having blood or skin taken for research purposes (P < 0.0001) compared to liver and bone biopsies.  Conclusions:   Patients with cancer show a greater willingness to consider APBs compared to RPOBs, and biopsies performed at less invasive body sites. There are differences in the attitudes of patients with different cancers towards research biopsies. Further research addressing motivations and barriers to research biopsies should be considered to increase the availability of this important resource.""","""['Danielle H Robinson', 'Leonid Churilov', 'Nancy U Lin', 'Elgene Lim', 'Davinia Seah']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Attitudes of patients with metastatic breast cancer toward research biopsies.', 'Variation in the Attitudes of Medical Oncologists Toward Research Biopsies in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Perceptions of patients with early stage breast cancer toward research biopsies.', 'Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', '""As Long as You Ask"": A Qualitative Study of Biobanking Consent-Oncology Patients\' and Health Care Professionals\' Attitudes, Motivations, and Experiences-the B-PPAE Study.']"""

In this study, we report the effects of AR antagonist, enzalutamide on the protein contents of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs mediate cell-to-cell communication and increasing evidence shows the role of EVs in promoting cancer survival and metastasis. We found that treatment with enzalutamide alters the secretion of EVs, one of which is a plasma membrane calcium pump, ATP2B1/PMCA ATPase, as an AR-regulated EV protein. We highlight the networks of interactions between AR, Ca2+ , and ATP2B1, where the extracellular proteins thrombospondin-1, gelsolin, and integrin√ü1 were previously reported as regulators for cancer progression and metastasis, indicating the potential role of EV-derived proteins in mediating calcium homoeostasis under AR inhibition by enzalutamide.

Although several reports described connections between sarcosine and various phenotypic changes of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, there is still a lack of insights on the complex phenomena of its effects on gene expression patterns, particularly in non-malignant and non-metastatic cells.  Methods:   To shed more light on this phenomenon, we performed parallel microarray profiling of RNA isolated from non-malignant (PNT1A), malignant (22Rv1), and metastatic (PC-3) prostate cell lines treated with sarcosine. Microarray results were experimentally verified using semi-quantitative-RT-PCR, clonogenic assay, through testing of the susceptibility of cells pre-incubated with sarcosine to anticancer agents with different modes of actions (inhibitors of topoisomerase II, DNA cross-linking agent, antimicrotubule agent and inhibitor of histone deacetylases) and by evaluation of activation of executioner caspases 3/7.  Results:   We identified that irrespective of the cell type, sarcosine stimulates up-regulation of distinct sets of genes involved in cell cycle and mitosis, while down-regulates expression of genes driving apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that in all cell types, sarcosine had pronounced stimulatory effects on clonogenicity. Except of an inhibitor of histone deacetylase valproic acid, efficiency of all agents was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in sarcosine pre-incubated cells.

Dicoumarol treatment was used to inhibit quinone reductase activity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was applied as a ROS scavenger. ROS production was quantified by H2 DCFDA flow cytometry. LQB-118 treated cells were evaluated for changes in lipid peroxidation, viability, and apoptosis. Treatment-induced gene expression was measured by RT-qPCR and Western Blot. SOD1 knockdown was achieved with siRNA or miRNA mimic transfection. MicroRNA specificity was determined by 3'UTR reporter assay. Oral LQB-118 treatment (10 mg/kg/day) efficacy was determined in athymic male nude mice bearing subcutaneous PC3 xenograft tumors.  Results:   LQB-118 treatment triggered PCa cell death and apoptosis. Therapeutic activity was at least partially dependent upon quinone reduction and ROS generation. LQB-118 treatment caused an increase in cellular ROS and lipid peroxidation. Treated cells exhibited elevated levels of NQO1, Nrf2, and SOD1. The miRNAs miR-206, miR-1, and miR-101 targeted and reduced SOD1 expression. The knockdown of SOD1, by siRNA or miRNA, enhanced LQB-118 cytotoxicity. Orally administered LQB-118 treatment significantly reduced the growth of established PCa xenograft tumors.

Circulating microRNAs were quantified using real-time RT-PCR microRNA array that allowed specific analysis of previously identified candidate miRNAs (miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-210, and miR-375) as well as discovery analysis to identify new candidate miRNAs. MiRNA levels were correlated to previously reported CTC counts using CellSearch¬Æ (Veridex) and with the primary study outcome of 28-week PSA response (‚â§0.2, 0.2 to ‚â§4.0, or >4.0 ng/mL), previously shown to correlate with overall survival.  Results:   We observed a correlation between baseline circulating miR-141, miR-200a, and miR-375 levels with baseline CTCs. Baseline miR-375 levels were associated with 28-week PSA response (‚â§0.2, 0.2 to ‚â§4.0, or >4.0 ng/mL, P = 0.007). Using ROC curve analysis, there was no significant difference between baseline miR-375 and baseline CTC in predicting 28-week PSA response (‚â§0.2 vs >0.2 ng/mL). To discover novel candidate miRNAs, we analyzed 365 miRNAs for association with the 28-week PSA response endpoint and identified new candidate miRNAs along with the existing candidates miR-375 and miR-200b (P = 0.0012, P = 0.0046, respectively.  Conclusions:   Baseline plasma miR-141, miR-200a, and miR-375 levels are associated with baseline CTC count. Baseline miR-375 was also associated with the trial endpoint of 28-week PSA response. Our results provide evidence that circulating miRNA biomarkers may have value as prognostic biomarkers and warrant further study in larger prospective clinical trials.""","""['Heather H Cheng', 'Melissa Plets', 'Hongli Li', 'Celestia S Higano', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Maha Hussain', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Muneesh Tewari', 'Evan Y Yu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Circulating microRNAs and Treatment Response in the Phase II SWOG S0925 Study for Patients with New Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'SWOG S0925: A Randomized Phase II Study of Androgen Deprivation Combined With Cixutumumab Versus Androgen Deprivation Alone in Patients With New Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of circulating MicroRNA 141 to circulating tumor cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and prostate-specific antigen for determining treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Baseline Circulating Tumor Cell Count as a Prognostic Marker of PSA Response and Disease Progression in Metastatic Castrate-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (SWOG S1216).', 'Circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer: a potential surrogate marker of survival.', 'Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Patients at PSA Recurrence and Review of the Literature.', 'Recent Advances in Transcription Factors Biomarkers and Targeted Therapies Focusing on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Epigenetic markers and therapeutic targets for metastasis.', 'Characterization of proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs of circulating extracellular vesicles from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy subjects.', 'Three Pathways of Cancer Cachexia: Inflammation, Changes in Adipose Tissue and Loss of Muscle Mass-The Role of miRNAs.', 'The potential of cell-free and exosomal microRNAs as biomarkers in liquid biopsy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

However, the specific function and clinical significance of GLUT1 in prostate cancer (PCa) are still unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of GLUT1 in PCa.  Methods:   GLUT1 protein levels in prostate cancer tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissues were measured and compared. Furthermore, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were both used to detect GLUT1 expression levels in different PCa cell lines. Flow cytometry and cell-based assays, such as a glucose uptake and lactate secretion assay, CCK-8 assay, and transwell migration and wound healing assay, were used to monitor cancer cell cycle distribution, glycolysis, proliferation, and motility, respectively. Moreover, a mouse tumor xenograft model was used to investigate the role of GLUT1 in tumor progression in vivo.  Results:   GLUT1 expression levels are higher in PCa tissues than in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. The results from real-time PCR and Western blot analysis revealed a similar increase in the GLUT1 expression levels in PCa cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of GLUT1 inhibits cell glycolysis and proliferation and leads to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in the 22RV1 cell line but not in the PC3 cell line. In vivo experiments further confirmed that GLUT1 knockdown inhibits the growth of tumors derived from the 22RV1 cell line. In addition, we also showed that GLUT1 knockdown has no effect on cell migration in vitro.  Conclusions:   GLUT1 may play an important role in PCa progression via mediating glycolysis and proliferation. Our study also indicated a potential crosstalk between GLUT1-mediated glycolysis and androgen sensitivity in PCa.""","""['Hengjun Xiao', 'Jun Wang', 'Weixin Yan', 'Yubin Cui', 'Zheng Chen', 'Xin Gao', 'Xingqiao Wen', 'Jun Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['FOXM1 regulates glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma by transactivating glucose transporter 1 expression.', 'Circular RNA circDENND4C facilitates proliferation, migration and glycolysis of colorectal cancer cells through miR-760/GLUT1 axis.', 'Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive prostate cancer cells present a distinct glycolytic metabolism profile.', 'The progress and development of GLUT1 inhibitors targeting cancer energy metabolism.', 'The dark side of glucose transporters in prostate cancer: Are they a new feature to characterize carcinomas?', 'Analysis of the relationship between GLUT family in the progression and immune infiltration of head and neck squamous carcinoma.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'BMP4 upregulates glycogen synthesis through the SMAD/SLC2A1 (GLUT1) signaling axis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.', 'Functional importance of glucose transporters and chromatin epigenetic factors in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM): possible therapeutics.', 'Cell death-related biomarker SLC2A1 has a significant role in prognosis prediction and immunotherapy efficacy evaluation in pan-cancer.']"""

Methods:   Study subjects were 102 men consecutively diagnosed with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy and 38 men diagnosed with bladder cancer undergoing cystoprostatectomy without prostate cancer at the pathological examination. Whole mount sections from all patients were evaluated for the epithelial and stromal expression of CD4+ Tregs and CD8+ Tregs in normal, PAH, PIN, and tumor lesions. A Friedma≈Ñs test was used to investigate differences in the mean number of Tregs across histological lesions. Logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for prostate cancer for each histological area.  Results:   In men with prostate cancer, similarly high numbers of stromal CD4+ Tregs were identified in PAH and tumor, but CD4+ Tregs were less common in PIN. Greater numbers of epithelial CD4+ Tregs in normal prostatic tissue were positively associated with both Gleason score and pT-stage. We observed a fourfold increased risk of prostate cancer in men with epithelial CD4+ Tregs in the normal prostatic tissue counterpart.  Conclusions:   Our results may suggest a possible pathway through which PAH develops directly into prostate cancer in the presence of CD4+ Tregs and indicate that transformation of the anti-tumor immune response may be initiated even before the primary tumor is established.""","""['Sabina Davidsson', 'Ove Andren', 'Anna-Lena Ohlson', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Swen-Olof Andersson', 'Francesca Giunchi', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Distribution of Foxp3-, CD4- and CD8-positive lymphocytic cells in benign and malignant prostate tissue.', 'Incidentally detected prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies: pathological and morphometric comparison with clinically detected cancer in totally embedded specimens.', 'Lymphatic vessel density in the normal-looking columnar epithelium adjacent to and distant from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer assessed in whole-mount sections.', 'Concomitant pathology in the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens: a prospective study and review.', 'Precursors of prostate cancer.', 'A Five Glutamine-Associated Signature Predicts Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Links Glutamine Metabolism with Tumor Microenvironment.', 'CACYBP knockdown inhibits progression of prostate cancer via p53.', 'The Role of Cutibacterium acnes in Sarcoidosis: From Antigen to Treatable Trait?', 'Anti-tumor activity of a T-helper 1 multiantigen vaccine in a murine model of prostate cancer.', 'Inflammation and Prostate Cancer: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Identifying Opportunities for Treatment and Prevention.']"""

We determine whether patterns of radiotherapy referral and treatment post-prostatectomy reflect guideline-based use in a contemporary prostatectomy cohort.  Materials and methods:   Electronic treatment records were linked to Ontario's cancer registry. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate clinical and health systems factors associated with referral and the use of adjuvant radiotherapy within 6 months post-prostatectomy.  Results:   Among 2663 patients treated with prostatectomy between 1 January 2012 and 30 November 2012, 1261 (47%) were found to have adverse pathology and 492 were referred to radiation oncology ‚â§6 months post-prostatectomy, of whom 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy. Multivariable analysis showed that patients were more likely to be referred to radiation oncology from a low-volume surgical facility (‚â§50 versus >50 radical prostatectomy cases, odds ratio 2.50 [1.80-3.48]), if they lived farther from a radiotherapy centre (>50 km versus <10 km, odds ratio 1.73 [1.22-2.46]), if they were seen by radiation oncology preoperatively (odds ratio 1.95 [1.51-2.52]), or if they had adverse pathology: high T-category (pT3b/T4 versus pT2, odds ratio 17.87 [12.14-26.30]; pT3a versus pT2, odds ratio 5.24 [3.95-6.97]), positive margins (non-apex positive versus negative, odds ratio 4.20 [3.19-5.53]; apex only positive versus negative, odds ratio 2.60 [1.71-3.94]) and high Gleason score (8-10 versus ‚â§6, odds ratio 11.32 [5.37-23.84]; 7 versus ‚â§6, odds ratio 4.18 [2.16-8.10]). Wide geographic variation in radiotherapy referral rates persisted (range 6-66%; P < 0.0001). After radiotherapy referral, only high T-category (pT3b/T4 versus pT2, odds ratio 5.37 [3.01-9.60]; pT3a versus pT2, odds ratio 2.72 [1.59-4.65]) and non-apex positive margins (odds ratio 2.81 [1.86-4.23]) remained significantly predictive of treatment.  Conclusions:   Variations in referral for a discussion of radiotherapy post-prostatectomy are not mainly explained by patient characteristics. After seeing radiation oncology, treatment decisions correlated most strongly with pathological findings. Understanding the reasons for the tremendous non-clinical variations in care is needed to ensure access to potentially curative radiotherapy post-prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer patients.""","""['C J Jin', 'T P Hanna', 'E F Cook', 'Q Miao', 'M D Brundage']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Quality of Radiation Therapy Referral and Utilisation Post-prostatectomy: A Population-based Study of Time Trends.', 'Variation in treatment recommendations of adjuvant radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer by physician specialty.', 'Comparison of Perioperative and Early Oncologic Outcomes between Open and Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy in a Contemporary Population Based Cohort.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy: do the AUA/ASTRO guidelines have all the answers?', 'Time management: Improving the timing of post-prostatectomy radiotherapy, clinical trials, and knowledge translation.', 'Radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: Effect of timing of postprostatectomy radiation on functional outcomes.', 'Geographical Variations in Prostate Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review of International Evidence.']"""

Methods and analysis:   This study will be conducted at a large public teaching hospital in Australia offering the choice between robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy from early 2017. Men (20-30) diagnosed with LPC who want curative treatment and meet criteria for either treatment will be invited to participate. In this mixed-methods study, patients will complete semistructured interviews before and after attending a combined clinic in which they consult a urologist and a radiation oncologist regarding treatment and four questionnaires (one before treatment decision-making and three after) assessing demographic and clinical characteristics, involvement in decision-making, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret.

Nevertheless, the roles of miR-27b and miR-34a in docetaxel resistance of PCa and their molecular mechanisms are far from being elucidated. In this study, we found that miR-27b and miR-34a were significantly downregulated in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Gain-of-function experiments showed that overexpression of miR-27b or miR-34a enhanced docetaxel sensitivity and inhibited EMT in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Moreover, miR-27b and miR-34a was demonstrated to directly target ZEB1 and suppress ZEB1 expression. Loss-of-function analysis disclosed that ZEB1 knockdown enhanced docetaxel sensitivity and suppressed EMT in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Rescue experiments presented that ZEB1 overexpression abolished the effects of miR-27b or miR-34a overexpression on docetaxel sensitivity and EMT in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells.

We have designed a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CBZ as a weekly schedule for 'unfit' mCRPC patients after docetaxel failure.  Methods:   In this single arm phase II study. CBZ was weekly administered in 1-hour infusion on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, every 5 weeks at 10 mg/m2 to eligible 'unfit' patients; oral prednisone (5 mg) was administered twice a day. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) were also collected. New treatment scheme was considered effective if at least 65% of patients met a clinical benefit criteria based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS) values at week 12.  Results:   Seventy patients (median age: 73.9 years) were enrolled; overall, 71.4% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) of 2; and 84%, 16% and 11% had bone, liver and lung metastases, respectively. Objective partial response or stable disease was achieved in 61% of patients, while PSA responses of ‚â•50% and ‚â•80% were observed in 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively. The median PSA-PFS was 4.8 months; and 68.6% of patients had no progression at week 12. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (2.8%), leukopenia (5.7%) and thrombocytopaenia (9%); no cases of febrile neutropenia were reported.

Objective:   To determine the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI to detect residual PCa following focal therapy with irreversible electroporation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Seventy-six patients with biopsy-proven localized PCa consented for primary irreversible electroporation between February 2013 and March 2016. Final analysis was performed on 50 patients that received follow-up mpMRI at 6 mo, serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and transperineal template-mapping biopsies at 12 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outfield regions of interest (ROI) were reported using PI-RADS version 2. A binary outcome (suspicious vs nonsuspicious) was given for the infield ablation zone. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were calculated for different definitions of significant PCa: (1) Gleason ‚â•4+3 or Gleason ‚â•3+3 with a maximum cancer core length ‚â•6mm, (2) Gleason ‚â•3+4 or Gleason ‚â•3+3 with a maximum cancer core length ‚â•4mm, for outfield and infield ROI. Multivariate linear regression analyses evaluated the additional value of nadir PSA.  Results and limitations:   Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of infield ROI was 43%, 86%, 33%, and 90% for definition 1 and 38%, 86%, 33%, and 88% for definition 2, respectively. For outfield ROI this was 33%, 82%, 20%, and 90% for definition 1 and 38%, 86%, 50%, and 80% for definition 2. PSA had no additional value in predicting residual significant PCa. Limitations include retrospective design, single reader, and low incidence of residual PCa.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary data suggest that mpMRI can rule out high-volume residual PCa. However, follow-up biopsies should still be performed to determine oncological control.

An alternative treatment is the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT), which involves the activation of a photosensitizer by a defined wavelength of light in the presence of oxygen, generating transient concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we explored the anti-cancer potential and mechanism of action of PDT using pheophorbide (Pheo) as a photosensitizer in combination with 670nm LEDs. Our hypothesis was that Pheo-PDT combination will demonstrate anti-cancer activity against androgen dependent PCa (ADPC), suggesting an alternative and less toxic cancer treatment. Pheo-PDT demonstrated significant anti-cancer activity against ADPC in as little as 5J/cm2 with increased effects, in a Pheo concentration dependent manner. We also observed in vitro inhibition in the clonogenic potential, as well as significant inhibition of invasion and migration, implicating the anti-metastatic activity of Pheo-PDT on PCa. Furthermore, Pheo-PDT caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The oncolytic activity of PDT involves the generation of ROS, and we demonstrated immediate ROS formation subsequent to Pheo-PDT as well. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the anti-cancer activity of Pheo-PDT is via ER stress, along with inhibition of important cell growth and proliferation markers. Hence, we conclude that Pheo-PDT proves to be a potential therapeutic strategy against ADPC.""","""['Taher Gheewala', 'Troy Skwor', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Pheophorbide\xa0a-mediated photodynamic therapy induces apoptotic cell death in murine oral squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.', 'A photodynamic bifunctional conjugate for prostate cancer: an in vitro mechanistic study.', 'Photodynamic therapy of Pheophorbide a inhibits the proliferation of human breast tumour via both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways in in vitro and in vivo models.', 'Photosensitizers in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Tumor cell survival pathways activated by photodynamic therapy: a molecular basis for pharmacological inhibition strategies.', 'Eprinomectin: a derivative of ivermectin suppresses growth and metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells by targeting the Œ≤-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Free and Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate-Bounded BODIPYs: Photodynamic and Antimigratory Effects in 2D and 3D Cancer Models.', 'Some Natural Photosensitizers and Their Medicinal Properties for Use in Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Eprinomectin, a novel semi-synthetic macrocylic lactone is cytotoxic to PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells via inducing apoptosis.', 'Synthesis and Photodynamic Activity of Vitamin-Chlorin Conjugates at Nanomolar Concentrations against Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

The present study describes the gene expression changes induced in response to RT in human prostate tissue obtained from a prospective tissue acquisition study designed for radiobiology research.  Methods and materials:   A prospective cohort of 5 men with intermediate-risk and clinically localized tumors were treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy with 2 √ó 10-Gy fractions. Image-guided transperineal biopsy specimens were taken immediately before and 14 days after the first high-dose-rate brachytherapy fraction. Using genome-wide 3' RNA sequencing on total RNA extracted from 10 biopsy specimens, we obtained quantitative expression data for a median of 13,244 genes. We computed the fold-change information for each gene and extracted high-confidence lists of transcripts with either increased or decreased expression (‚â•1.5-fold) after radiation in ‚â•4 of the 5 patients. Several gene ontology analyses were then used to identify functionally enriched pathways.  Results:   The predominant change in response to RT was elevation of the transcript levels, including that of DNA damage binding protein 2 and p21, and collagens, laminins, and integrins. We observed strong upregulation of the p53 pathway, without observable dysregulation of p53 itself. Interstitial remodeling, extracellular matrix proteins, and focal adhesion pathways were also strongly upregulated, as was inflammation. Functional network analysis showed clustering of the changes inherent in apoptosis and programmed cell death, extracellular matrix organization, and immune regulation.  Conclusions:   In the present prospective study of matched clinical tissues, we successfully recognized known radiation-sensitive transcriptional pathways and identified numerous other novel and significantly altered genes with no current association with RT.

Here, we use data from a series of cell proliferation assays, with a prostate cancer cell line, to calibrate a spatially continuous individual based model (IBM) of collective cell migration and proliferation. The IBM explicitly accounts for crowding effects by modifying the rate of movement, direction of movement, and the rate of proliferation by accounting for pair-wise interactions. Taking a Bayesian approach we estimate the free parameters in the IBM using rejection sampling on three separate, independent experimental data sets. Since the posterior distributions for each experiment are similar, we perform simulations with parameters sampled from a new posterior distribution generated by combining the three data sets. To explore the predictive power of the calibrated IBM, we forecast the evolution of a fourth experimental data set. Overall, we show how to calibrate a lattice-free IBM to experimental data, and our work highlights the importance of interactions between individuals. Despite great care taken to distribute cells as uniformly as possible experimentally, we find evidence of significant spatial clustering over short distances, suggesting that standard mean-field models could be inappropriate.""","""['Alexander P Browning', 'Scott W McCue', 'Rachelle N Binny', 'Michael J Plank', 'Esha T Shah', 'Matthew J Simpson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Calibrating an individual-based movement model to predict functional connectivity for little owls.', 'Spatial Moment Description of Birth-Death-Movement Processes Incorporating the Effects of Crowding and Obstacles.', 'Models of collective cell behaviour with crowding effects: comparing lattice-based and lattice-free approaches.', 'A fully continuous individual-based model of tumor cell evolution.', 'Statistical and Bayesian approaches to RNA secondary structure prediction.', 'Quantification of spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity in an agent-based model of tumour-macrophage interactions.', 'Integration of quantitative methods and mathematical approaches for the modeling of cancer cell proliferation dynamics.', 'Travelling-Wave and Asymptotic Analysis of a Multiphase Moving Boundary Model for Engineered Tissue Growth.', 'A stochastic mathematical model of 4D tumour spheroids with real-time fluorescent cell cycle labelling.', 'Magnesium ions regulate mesenchymal stem cells population and osteogenic differentiation: A fuzzy agent-based modeling approach.']"""

Methods:   We held four focus groups with breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors who had completed treatment with intent to cure and two with caregivers for the same population.

The discussions focused on cancer-related experiences and needs during the transition out of acute cancer care.  Results:   Focus groups included 47 people: 28 survivors and 19 caregivers. Three key caregiving themes identified the significance of support for the patient in the clinic, support for the patient in the home, and for caregiver self-care.  Conclusions:   Discussions revealed aspects of caregiving that created difficulties for the caregiver themselves or between the caregiver and the cancer survivor.

There is emerging evidence underscores the critical role of autophagy in the onset, progression, and chemoresistance of PCa. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of a novel autophagy regulator, activating molecule in beclin1-regulated autophagy1 (Ambra1), a novel ATG gene in the sensitivity or PCa cells to cisplatin. We explored the regulation by the Ambra1 manipulation on the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in human PCa DU145 cells in the presence of cisplatin, via up- or down-regulating Ambra1 expression. In addition, we examined the colony forming of DU145 cells post cisplatin treatment and Ambra1 manipulation. Our results demonstrated that the Ambra1 up-regulation reduced, whereas Ambra1 knockdown increased the cisplatin-induced apoptosis, caspase 3 cleavage, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Interestingly, we also found significant autophagy induction in the cisplatin-treated DU145 cells, with increased autophagic vesicles, up-regulated autophagy-related markers. However, the cisplatin-induced autophagy was up-regulated by the Ambra1 overexpression or was down-regulated by the Ambra1 knockdown. In addition, the colony forming was also positively regulated by Ambra1 in DU145 cells post cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, Ambra1 negatively regulates the cisplatin-induced apoptosis and the cisplatin-mediated growth reduction in DU145 cells, in association with the Ambra1-mediated autophagy promotion. It implies that Ambra1-mediated autophagy might be an important mechanism underlining the sensitivity reduction of PCa cells.""","""['Jie Liu', 'Zhiyuan Chen', 'Jia Guo', 'Lei Wang', 'Xiuheng Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Ambra1 in cancer: implications for clinical oncology.', 'shRNA-mediated AMBRA1 knockdown reduces the cisplatin-induced autophagy and sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin.', 'Ambra1 is an essential regulator of autophagy and apoptosis in SW620 cells: pro-survival role of Ambra1.', 'Ambra1 modulates starvation-induced autophagy through AMPK signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes.', 'AMBRA1, a Novel BH3-Like Protein: New Insights Into the AMBRA1-BCL2-Family Proteins Relationship.', 'Ambra1 modulates the sensitivity of mantle cell lymphoma to palbociclib by regulating cyclin D1.', 'Docetaxel Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Transcriptomic Determinants and the Effect of Inhibiting Wnt/Œ≤-Catenin Signaling by XAV939.', 'AMBRA1 and its role as a target for anticancer therapy.', 'Ambra1 in cancer: implications for clinical oncology.', 'Risk score model of autophagy-related genes in osteosarcoma.']"""

However, given a small number of biological samples yet a large number of genes, this problem suffers from the difficulty of high computational complexity and imposes challenges to the accuracy of identification statistically.  Results:   In this paper, we propose a parsimonious model representation and develop efficient algorithms for identification. Particularly, we derive an equivalent model subject to a sum-to-zero constraint in penalized linear regression, where the correspondence between nonzero coefficients in these models is established. Most importantly, it reduces the model complexity of the traditional approach from the quadratic order to the linear order in the number of candidate genes, while overcoming the difficulty of model nonidentifiablity. Computationally, we develop an algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to deal with the constraint. Numerically, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional method in terms of the statistical accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that our ADMM algorithm is more computationally efficient than a coordinate descent algorithm with a local search. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method on a prostate cancer dataset to identify gene pairs that are associated with pre-operative prostate-specific antigen.

Methods such as the cell painting assay and multiplexing fluorescent dyes to reveal broadly relevant cellular components were recently suggested for MOA prediction. We demonstrated that adding fluorescent dyes to a single assay has limited impact on MOA prediction accuracy, as monitoring only the nuclei stain could reach compelling levels of accuracy. This observation suggested that multiplexed measurements are highly correlated and nuclei stain could possibly reflect the general state of the cell. We then hypothesized that combining unrelated and possibly simple cell-based assays could bring a solution that would be biologically and technically more relevant to predict a drug target than using a single assay multiplexing dyes.

Activation of this signaling pathway is frequently found in human cancers. Our previous studies demonstrated that Œ¥-tocopherol (Œ¥-T) attenuates the activation of AKT by growth factor in prostate cancer cell lines, leading to inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Herein, we investigated whether Œ¥-T inhibits the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate-specific Pten-/- (Ptenp-/-) mice in which the activation of AKT is the major driving force for tumorigenesis. By feeding Ptenp-/- mice with AIN93M or 0.2% Œ¥-T supplemented diet starting at the age of 6 or 12 weeks, we found that Œ¥-T treatment reduced prostate adenocarcinoma multiplicity at the age of 40 weeks by 53.3 and 42.7%, respectively. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation of AKT (T308) was reduced in the prostate of the mice administered the Œ¥-T diet. Consistently, proliferation was reduced and apoptosis was increased in prostate lesions of mice on the Œ¥-T diet. Oxidative stress, as determined by IHC staining of 8-OH-dG, was not altered during prostate tumorigenesis, nor was it affected by administration of Œ¥-T. In contrast, Œ±-tocopherol (Œ±-T) at 0.2% in the diet did not affect prostate adenocarcinoma multiplicity in the Ptenp-/- mice. This finding is consistent with data from our previous study that Œ¥-T, but not Œ±-T, inhibits the activation of AKT and the growth of prostate cancer cells. Together, these results demonstrate that Œ¥-T inhibits the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in Ptenp-/- mice, mainly through inhibition of AKT activation.""","""['Hong Wang', 'Xu Yang', 'Anna Liu', 'Guocan Wang', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Chung S Yang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Œ¥-Tocopherol inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase-induced AKT activation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'Dietary tocopherols inhibit PhIP-induced prostate carcinogenesis in CYP1A-humanized mice.', 'PTEN, more than the AKT pathway.', 'Cancer prevention by different forms of tocopherols.', 'Metabolomic Analysis of Vitamin E Supplement Use in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Selected Seeds as Sources of Bioactive Compounds with Diverse Biological Activities.', 'Association between circulating vitamin E and ten common cancers: evidence from large-scale Mendelian randomization analysis and a longitudinal cohort study.', 'Œ¥-Tocotrienol is the Most Potent Vitamin E Form in Inhibiting Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Ptenp-/- Mice.', 'Vitamin E beyond Its Antioxidant Label.']"""

Irreversible synthesis of estrogens from androgens is catalyzed by aromatase. Interestingly, animals lacking aromatase do not develop cancer or prostatitis, whereas those with overexpression of aromatase and, consequently, high estrogen levels develop prostatitis and squamous metaplasia via estrogen receptor 1 (ERŒ±). Even with this evidence, the aromatase expression in the prostate is controversial. Moreover, little is known about the occurrence of age-dependent variation of aromatase and its association with histopathological changes commonly found in advanced age, a knowledge gap that is addressed herein. For this purpose, the immunoexpression of aromatase was evaluated in the prostatic complex of young adult to senile Wistar rats. ERŒ± was also investigated, to extend our understanding of estrogen responsiveness in the prostate. Moderate cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for aromatase was detected in the glandular epithelium. Eventually, some basal cells showed intense staining for aromatase. The expression pattern for aromatase appeared similar in the normal epithelium when young and senile rats were compared; this result was corroborated by Western blotting. Conversely, in senile rats, there was an increase in the frequency of basal cells intensely stained for aromatase, which appeared concentrated in areas of intraepithelial proliferation and prostatitis. These punctual areas also presented increased ERŒ± positivity. Together, these findings suggest a plausible source for hormonal imbalance favoring estrogen production, which, by acting through ERŒ±, may favor the development of prostatic lesions commonly found in advanced age.""","""['M√¥nica Morais-Santos', 'Hip√°cia Werneck-Gomes', 'Gabriel H Campolina-Silva', 'Leticia C Santos', 'Germ√°n A B Mahecha', 'Rex A Hess', 'Cleida A Oliveira']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Changes in Estrogen Receptor ERŒ≤ (ESR2) Expression without Changes in the Estradiol Levels in the Prostate of Aging Rats.', 'Profile of cell proliferation and apoptosis activated by the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the prostate of aging rats.', 'Aromatase and regulating the estrogen:androgen ratio in the prostate gland.', 'The modulation of aromatase and estrogen receptor alpha in cultured human dermal papilla cells by dexamethasone: a novel mechanism for selective action of estrogen via estrogen receptor beta?', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil Modulates Steroid Hormones Signaling in a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Sequential Colocalization of ERa, PR, and AR Hormone Receptors Using Confocal Microscopy Enables New Insights into Normal Breast and Prostate Tissue and Cancers.', 'Short-term exposure to chrysin promotes proliferative responses in the ventral male prostate and female prostate of adult gerbils.']"""

Comprehensive positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging using fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose F 18 ([18F]-FDG) for glycolysis (Glyc) and fluorodihydrotestosterone F 18 ([18F]-FDHT) for androgen receptor (AR) expression determine heterogeneity of imaging phenotypes, which may be useful in distinguishing patients who will benefit from ARSi drugs from those who need alternative treatments.  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that PET/CT-based assessments of AR expression and glycolytic activity would reveal heterogeneity affecting prognosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between April 6, 2007, and October 4, 2012, patients with mCRPC underwent imaging with both [18F]-FDG and [18F]-FDHT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The patients were naive to ARSi treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate and were referred during documented disease progression. Image-directed biopsy determined the presence or absence of prostate cancer at positive imaging sites.  Interventions:   PET/CT imaging was performed with [18F]-FDHT and [18F]-FDG; select individual lesions were biopsied to correlate imaging phenotype with histologic findings.  Main outcomes and measures:   All metabolically active lesions were interpreted as [18F]-FDHT-positive (AR1) or [18F]-FDHT-negative (AR0) and as [18F]-FDG-positive (Glyc1) or [18F]-FDG-negative (Glyc0). Correlation was performed with overall survival for both individual lesion imaging phenotype as well as patient-specific imaging phenotype.  Results:   The mean (SD) age of the 133 patients was 68 (8.6) years. Imaging phenotypes of 2405 PET/CT-positive lesions (median, 12.0 per patient) included 1713 (71.2%) AR1Glyc1, 386 (16.0%) AR1Glyc0, and 306 (12.7%) AR0Glyc1. On multivariate analysis, each phenotype had an independent negative impact effect on survival, most pronounced for AR0Glyc1 lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16; P < .001), followed by AR1Glyc1 lesions (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06; P < .001) and AR1Glyc0 lesions (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P = .048). When sorted by lesion type, 4 patient-specific groups emerged: (1) concordant, with all AR1Glyc1 (34 patients [25.6%]); (2) AR predominant, with AR1Glyc1 and varying numbers of AR1Glyc0 (33 [24.8%]); (3) Glyc predominant, with AR1Glyc1 and varying numbers of AR0Glyc1 (40 [30.1%]); and (4) mixed, with AR1Glyc1 plus a mixture of varying numbers of AR1Glyc0 and AR0Glyc1 (26 [19.5%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Heterogeneity of PET/CT imaging phenotype has clinical relevance on a lesion and individual patient level. With regard to mCRPC lesions, most express ARs, consistent with initial benefit of ARSi drugs.

We hypothesized that the immune system presents a common selective pressure on high mutation burden tumors and therefore immune evasion mutations would be enriched in high mutation burden tumors. The JAK family of kinases is required for the signaling of a host of immune modulators in tumor, stromal, and immune cells. Therefore, we analyzed alterations in this family for the hypothesized signature of an immune evasion mutation. Here, we searched a database of 61,704 unique solid tumors for alterations in the JAK family kinases (JAK1/2/3, TYK2). We used The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data to confirm and extend our findings by analyzing gene expression patterns. Recurrent frameshift mutations in JAK1 were associated with high mutation burden and microsatellite instability. These mutations occurred in multiple tumor types including endometrial, colorectal, stomach, and prostate carcinomas. Analyzing gene expression signatures in endometrial and stomach adenocarcinomas revealed that tumors with a JAK1 frameshift exhibited reduced expression of interferon response signatures and multiple anti-tumor immune signatures. Importantly, endometrial cancer cell lines exhibited similar gene expression changes that were expected to be tumor cell intrinsic (e.g. interferon response) but not those expected to be tumor cell extrinsic (e.g. NK cells). From these data, we derive two primary conclusions: 1) JAK1 frameshifts are loss of function alterations that represent a potential pan-cancer adaptation to immune responses against tumors with microsatellite instability; 2) The mechanism by which JAK1 loss of function contributes to tumor immune evasion is likely associated with loss of the JAK1-mediated interferon response.""","""['Lee A Albacker', 'Jeremy Wu', 'Peter Smith', 'Markus Warmuth', 'Philip J Stephens', 'Ping Zhu', 'Lihua Yu', 'Juliann Chmielecki']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Microsatellite instability derived JAK1 frameshift mutations are associated with tumor immune evasion in endometrioid endometrial cancer.', 'Multilevel genomics of colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability-clinical impact of JAK1 mutations and consensus molecular subtype 1.', 'B2M and JAK1/2-mutated MSI-H Colorectal Carcinomas Can Benefit From Anti-PD-1 Therapy.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors in malignancies with mismatch repair deficiency: a review of the state of the current knowledge.', 'Microsatellite instability: an update.', 'Genomic alterations related to HPV infection status in a cohort of Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'DNA mismatch repair in cancer immunotherapy.', 'JAK1 Pseudokinase V666G Mutant Dominantly Impairs JAK3 Phosphorylation and IL-2 Signaling.', 'Efficacy, safety and biomarker analysis of durvalumab in patients with mismatch-repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high solid tumours.', 'Microsatellite instability assessment is instrumental for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine: status quo and outlook.']"""

Methods:   Guam cancer incidence and mortality were compared to that of Hawaii using data from their respective population-based, central cancer registries.  Results:   In 2009-2013, overall cancer incidence was substantially lower in Guam than in Hawaii for both sexes while overall cancer mortality was higher for Guam males. Cervical cancer incidence and prostate cancer mortality were higher in Guam. Both incidence and mortality were higher among Guam men for cancers of the lung & bronchus, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, and nasopharynx; Chamorro men were disproportionately affected by these cancers. Filipinos and Whites in Guam had lower overall cancer incidence compared to Filipinos and Whites in Hawaii. Although breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in Guam compared to Hawaii, women in Guam presented at younger ages and with rarer disease histologies such as inflammatory carcinoma were more prevalent. Guam patients were also diagnosed at younger ages for cancers of bladder, pancreas, colon & rectum, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, lung & bronchus, stomach, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.  Conclusion:   Smoking, infectious agents, and betel nut chewing appear to be important contributors to the burden of cancer in Guam. Earlier onset of cancer in Guam suggests earlier age of exposure to key risk factors and/or a more aggressive pathogenesis. Contrasting cancer patterns within Guam and between Guam and Hawaii underscore the potential influence of genes, lifestyle, and environmental factors on cancer development and progression.""","""['Brenda Y Hernandez', 'Renata A Bordallo', 'Michael D Green', 'Robert L Haddock']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Ethnic disparities in cancer incidence among residents of Guam.', 'Ethnic disparities in cancer mortality among residents of Guam.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Common cancers in the elderly.', 'Barriers, Facilitators, and Strategies for Developing a Culturally Informed Lifestyle Intervention for Native Hawaiian, CHamoru, and Filipino Breast Cancer Survivors: Mixed-Methods Findings from Focus Group Participants.', 'Traditional and new lifestyle interventions to prevent breast cancer recurrence (TANICA): a qualitative study.', 'Oral Cancer Disparities in the Outer US-affiliated Pacific Islands.', 'Environmental Exposure to Cyanobacteria Hepatotoxins in a Pacific Island Community: A Cross-Sectional Assessment.', 'Head and Neck Cancer Stage at Presentation and Survival Outcomes Among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Patients Compared With Asian and White Patients.']"""

GM sizes vary. Large markers are easily visualized in MRI. Small GMs show fewer artefacts in CT but are harder to detect in MRI because the signal is influenced by metal in MRI. Therefore, we compared MRI visualization between linearly placed new iron-containing marker and non-iron containing marker.  Methods:   27 patients underwent CT/MRI fusion-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The gold markers were placed by urologists. An iron-containing Gold Anchor‚Ñ¢ (GA) marker (diameter, 0.28 mm; length, 10 mm) was placed by using a 22 G needle on one side of the prostate linearly. A non-iron-containing VISICOIL‚Ñ¢ (VIS) marker (diameter, 0.35 mm; length, 10 mm) was placed by using a 19 G needle on the opposite side linearly. T2* weighted MRI was mostly performed. Two Radiation Oncologists and one Radiation Technologist evaluated and assigned visual quality scores (GA shape, CT artefacts, MRI signal voids).  Results:   The mean visualization scores of artefacts were similar between GA and VIS in planning CT. GM visualization in MRI of the prostate was better for GA than for VIS. The visibility of the linear shape of the GA was 3.4-4.1 points when the VIS was 5 points (1 is worst and 5 is best).  Conclusion:   Visualization quality was similar between GA (iron-containing marker) and VIS (non-iron-containing marker) in planning CT, but was better for GA than for VIS in MRI. To achieve high-precision radiotherapy, an iron-containing gold marker was useful for CT and MRI registration. Advances in knowledge: An iron-containing fiducial marker was useful for CT and MRI registration, especially in high-precision radiotherapy, such as stereotactic body radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.""","""['Osamu Tanaka', 'Hisao Komeda', 'Masayoshi Tamaki', 'Kensaku Seike', 'Shota Fujimoto', 'Eiichi Yama', 'Shigeki Hirose', 'Masayuki Matsuo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Visibility of an iron-containing fiducial marker in magnetic resonance imaging for high-precision external beam prostate radiotherapy.', 'Fiducial marker for prostate radiotherapy: comparison of 0.35- and 0.5-mm-diameter computed tomography and magnetic resonance images.', 'Fiducial markers visibility and artefacts in prostate cancer radiotherapy multi-modality imaging.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Recent Metal Nanotheranostics for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy: A Review.']"""

We recently adapted a commercial silica-based column kit used in genomics to manually isolate DNA under mild conditions from FFPE tissues of rodents and humans and successfully measured DNA adducts of several carcinogens including aristolochic acid I (AA-I), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (Yun et al. (2013) Anal. Chem. 85, 4251-8, and Guo et al. (2016) Anal. Chem. 88, 4780-7). The DNA retrieval methodology is robust; however, the procedure is time-consuming and labor intensive, and not amenable to rapid throughput processing. In this study, we have employed the Promega Maxwell 16 MDx system, which is commonly used in large scale genomics studies, for the rapid throughput extraction of DNA. This system streamlines the DNA isolation procedure and increases the sample processing rate by about 8-fold over the manual method (32 samples versus 4 samples processed per hour). High purity DNA is obtained in satisfactory yield for the measurements of DNA adducts by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-ionization-ion trap-multistage scan mass spectrometry. The measurements show that the levels of DNA adducts of AA-I, 4-ABP, and PhIP in FFPE rodent and human tissues are comparable to those levels measured in DNA from matching tissues isolated by the commercial silica-based column kits and in DNA from fresh frozen tissues isolated by the conventional phenol-chloroform extraction method. The isolation of DNA from tissues is one major bottleneck in the analysis of DNA adducts. This rapid throughput methodology greatly decreases the time required to process DNA and can be employed in large-scale epidemiology studies designed to assess the role of chemical exposures and DNA adducts in cancer risk.""","""['Byeong Hwa Yun', 'Shun Xiao', 'Lihua Yao', 'Sesha Krishnamachari', 'Thomas A Rosenquist', 'Kathleen G Dickman', 'Arthur P Grollman', 'Paari Murugan', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Robert J Turesky']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Chem Res Toxicol""","""['Multiclass Carcinogenic DNA Adduct Quantification in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissues by Ultraperformance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.', 'Human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues: an untapped specimen for biomonitoring of carcinogen DNA adducts by mass spectrometry.', 'Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as a source for quantitation of carcinogen DNA adducts: aristolochic acid as a prototype carcinogen.', 'Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissues-An Untapped Biospecimen for Biomonitoring DNA Adducts by Mass Spectrometry.', 'Excavation of a buried treasure--DNA, mRNA, miRNA and protein analysis in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues.', 'Multi-DNA Adduct and Abasic Site Quantitation In Vivo by Nano-Liquid Chromatography/High-Resolution Orbitrap Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Methodology for Biomonitoring Colorectal DNA Damage.', 'The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Metabolism and biomarkers of heterocyclic aromatic amines in humans.', 'The role of heterocyclic aromatic amines in colorectal cancer: the evidence from epidemiologic studies.', 'Aristolochic acid I promoted clonal expansion but did not induce hepatocellular carcinoma in adult rats.']"""

The role of ST enzymes in tumour cell growth and metastasis, as well as links to multi-drug resistance, has seen ST inhibition emerge as a target for potential antimetastatic cancer treatments. The most potent of these reported inhibitors are transition-state analogues. Although there are several examples of these in the literature, many have suspected poor pharmacokinetic properties and are not readily synthetically accessible. A proposed solution to these problems is the use of a neutral carbamate or 1,2,3-triazole linker instead of the more commonly used phosphodiester linker, and replacing the traditionally utilised cytidine nucleotide with uridine. Another issue in this area is the paucity of structural information of human ST enzymes. However, in late 2015 the structure of human ST8Sia III was reported (only the second human ST described so far), creating the opportunity for structure-based design of selective ST8 inhibitors for the first time. Herein, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations with the newly published crystal structure of hST8Sia III were performed for the first time with selected ST transition state analogues. Simulations showed that these compounds could participate in many of the key interactions common with the natural donor and acceptor substrates, and reveals some key insights into the synthesis of potentially selective ST inhibitors.""","""['Christopher Dobie', 'Andrew P Montgomery', 'R√©mi Szabo', 'Danielle Skropeta', 'Haibo Yu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Mol Recognit""","""['Computational characterisation of the interactions between human ST6Gal I and transition-state analogue inhibitors: insights for inhibitor design.', 'Design, synthesis and evaluation of carbamate-linked uridyl-based inhibitors of human ST6Gal I.', 'Advancement of Sialyltransferase Inhibitors: Therapeutic Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Transition state-based ST6Gal I inhibitors: Mimicking the phosphodiester linkage with a triazole or carbamate through an enthalpy-entropy compensation.', 'The Intrinsic Relationship Between Structure and Function of the Sialyltransferase ST8Sia Family Members.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of selective phosphonate-bearing 1,2,3-triazole-linked sialyltransferase inhibitors.', 'Sialyltransferase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Cancer Metastasis: Current Challenges and Future Perspectives.', 'Aberrant Sialylation in Cancer: Biomarker and Potential Target for Therapeutic Intervention?', 'ICBS 2017 in Shanghai-Illuminating Life with Chemical Innovation.']"""

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been clearly defined. In this study, using various techniques such as high throughput sequencing technology, bioinformatics, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunoblot analysis, we aimed to understand whether matrine serves as a novel regulator of FOXO and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. DU145 and PC-3 cell lines were cultured for 24 h in vitro. Cells were treated with either matrine or control serum for 48 h, followed by extraction of total RNA. The RNA was sequenced using HiSeq 2500 high-throughput sequencing platform (Illumina). A gene library was established and quality analysis of read data carried out. Integrated database from the website DAVID was used to analyze Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway of differential genes was used for pathway analysis, screening for fold differences of more than two times. The FOXO and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways were screened, and expression levels of mRNA and core protein detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. High throughput sequencing and GO analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes before and after treatment played an important role in cell metabolic process, growth process, anatomical structure formation, cellular component organization, and biological regulation. KEGG signal pathway analysis revealed that FOXO and PI3K-AKT signal pathways had a significant difference between before and after matrine-treated androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU145. Real-time PCR showed that matrine treatment led to a significant increase in the expression levels of FOXO1A, FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in DU145 and PC-3 cells (P<0.01 or P<0.05), whereas the PI3K expression levels decreased (P<0.01). Similarly, immunoblotting revealed a significant increase (P<0.05) in the expression levels of FOXO1A FOXO3A, FOXO4, and FOXO6 in both PC-3 and DU145 cells, whereas PI3K expression levels decreased (P<0.05). Matrine had a broad regulating effect on the mRNA expression profiles of both PC-3 and DU145 cells. Matrine may inhibit cell proliferation, migration, as well as invasion, and induce apoptosis in both PC-3 and DU145 cells through FOXO and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Matrine could therefore be used as a complementary drug to present chemotherapeutic agents, for treating androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Qi Li', 'Hai Huang', 'Zheng He', 'Yi Sun', 'Yufeng Tang', 'Xiaohong Shang', 'Chengbin Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci China Life Sci""","""['Matrine Exerts Pharmacological Effects Through Multiple Signaling Pathways: A Comprehensive Review.', 'The specific killing effect of matrine on castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by targeting the Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway.', 'Matrine inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through regulation of the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway.', 'Matrine suppresses invasion of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by downregulating MMP-2/9 via NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'DNA repair pathways-targeted cyclovirobuxine inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer growth by promoting cell apoptosis and cycle arrest.', 'Matrine Exerts Pharmacological Effects Through Multiple Signaling Pathways: A Comprehensive Review.', 'The PI3K/Akt Pathway: Emerging Roles in Skin Homeostasis and a Group of Non-Malignant Skin Disorders.', 'Discovery of novel antagonists targeting the DNA binding domain of androgen receptor by integrated docking-based virtual screening and bioassays.', 'Combination of Cordycepin and Apatinib Synergistically Inhibits NSCLC Cells by Down-Regulating VEGF/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.']"""

A local chapter of International Us TOO Prostate Cancer Support Group (UTGB) has led an annual community-based prostate cancer screening clinic in Grand Bahama each September since 2009. Features of this initiative, characteristics of attendees, and a description of found cancers were summarized to determine the clinic's value and to guide improvements.  Method:   We analyzed the established clinic from 2012 to 2015, wherein UTGB attracted corporate funding, volunteers managed clinics, and health professionals provided healthcare services. An explicit algorithm was used to sort clients by age, comorbidities, and findings from digital rectal examinations, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, to determine which clients would undergo secondary assessment and prostate biopsy.  Results:   Overall, 1,844 males were registered (mean age 57.6 years), and only 149 men attended on more than one occasion for a total of 1,993 clinic visit. The urologist reviewed 315 men in secondary follow-up, for elevated PSA and/or an abnormal digital rectal examination. Of these, 45 men fulfilled criteria for trans-rectal ultrasound biopsy, and there were 40 found cases of prostate cancer, for a positive-predictive value of 89%. By D'Amico risk-stratification, these 40 cases were low (10%), intermediate (40%), and high risk (50%). The urologist counseled all 40 cases and facilitated access to standard care.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that low-resource countries can advance cost-effective screening clinics, apply policy guidelines, and provide services within acceptable standards of care. It is the expectation, with a sustained effort and community participation over the ensuing years, that earlier disease presentation will occur and, consequently, a concomitant decrease in the disease-specific mortality.""","""['Robin Roberts', 'Corydon Mitchell', 'Ana Lourdes Tancawan', 'Mandi Pedican', 'Glenn Wayne Jones']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Digital rectal examination in primary care is important for early detection of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis study.', 'Prevalence of prostate cancer in aging males receiving PSA (prostate specific antigen) screening test (A campaign for celebration of Siriraj Established Day).', 'Prostate cancer screening within a prostate specific antigen range of 3 to 3.9 ng./ml.: a comparison of digital rectal examination and free prostate specific antigen as supplemental screening tests.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Significance of serum free prostate specific antigen in the screening of prostate cancer.', 'The cancer epidemic in the Caribbean region: Further opportunities to reverse the disease trend.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Screening Strategies in a Low-Resource, High-risk Population in the Bahamas.']"""

Sef is downregulated in various human carcinomas, in a manner correlating with tumor aggressiveness. In vitro, hSef-b inhibited proliferation of TRAMP C2 cells and attenuated activation of ERK/MAPK and the master transcription factor NF-Œ∫B in response to FGF and IL-1/TNF, respectively. In vivo, transfection efficiency of a plasmid co-expressing hSef-b/eGFP into TRAMP C2 tumors was 14.7 ¬± 2.5% following a single TUS application. Repeated TUS treatments with hSef-b plasmid, significantly suppressed prostate tumor growth (60%) through inhibition of cell proliferation (60%), and reduction in blood vessel density (56%). In accordance, repeated TUS-treatments with hSef-b significantly inhibited in vivo expression of FGF2 and MMP-9. FGF2 is a known mitogen, and both FGF2/MMP-9 are proangiogenic factors. Taken together our results strongly suggest that hSef-b acts in a cell autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous manner.

Adherence to statins and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)/Œ≤-blockers reduces CAD-related hospitalizations. This study examined the relationship between medication adherence and CAD-related hospitalizations immediately following cancer diagnosis. Patients and Methods: A retrospective observational longitudinal study was conducted using SEER-Medicare data. Elderly Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with preexisting CAD and incident breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (N=12,096) were observed for 12 months before and after cancer diagnosis. Hospitalizations measured every 120 days were categorized into CAD-related hospitalization, other hospitalization, and no hospitalization. Medication adherence was categorized into 5 mutually exclusive groups: adherent to both statins and ACEIs/ARBs/Œ≤-blockers (reference group), not adherent to both statins and ACEIs/ARBs/Œ≤-blockers, adherent to either statins or ACEIs/ARBs/Œ≤-blockers, use of one medication class and adherent to that class, and use of one medication class and not adherent to that class. The relationship between medication adherence and hospitalization was analyzed using repeated measures multinomial logistic regressions. Inverse probability treatment weights were used to control for observed group differences among medication adherence categories. Results: Adherence to both statins and ACEIs/ARBs/Œ≤-blockers was estimated at 31.2% during the 120-day period immediately following cancer diagnosis; 13.7% were not adherent to both medication classes during the same period, and 27.4% had CAD-related hospitalizations immediately after cancer diagnosis, which declined to 10.6% during the last 4 months of the postdiagnosis period. In the adjusted analyses, those not adherent to both statins and ACEIs/ARBs/Œ≤-blockers were more likely to have CAD-related hospitalization compared with those adherent to both medication classes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.72-1.92; P<.0001).

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequencies, and Pearson's Chi-Square tests.Results: Participants were predominantly white (90%) with a mean age of 52.7 years with some post-high school education (80%) and the majority had received OC screenings (54%).The majority of participants perceived benefits of each specific cancer screening as very helpful: (a) OC screening (60%), (b) BC screening (79.2% females), (c) PC screening (63.8% males), and (d) CC screening (84%), and also reported no perceived risks regarding OC (80%), BC (60.4%), PC (66%) screening. Only 11% reported fear of finding cancer with an OC screening. The study findings supported significant associations (p<0.05) between consumer perceptions of cost and time as barriers to accessing all of the selected cancer screenings.Conclusion: This study identified associations between consumer perceptions of OC screening when compared with BC, PC, and CC. Concerns about cost and time for cancer screenings may reflect low consumer awareness regarding differences between OC and other cancer screenings. Future studies including larger samples representing more diverse populations are recommended to further explore the basis of participants' perceptions of cancer screenings and to identify ways to minimize barriers to cancer screenings.""","""['M Colleen Stephenson', 'JoAnn R Gurenlian', 'Denise M Bowen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Dent Hyg""","""['Effects of education based on the health belief model on screening behavior in high risk women for breast cancer, Tehran, Iran.', 'Health beliefs, illness perceptions and determinants of breast screening uptake in Malta: a cross-sectional survey.', 'Barriers and Attitudes toward Breast Cancer Screening among Omani Women.', 'Global Perceptions of Women on Breast Cancer and Barriers to Screening.', 'The contribution of artificial intelligence to reducing the diagnostic delay in oral cancer.']"""

Previously, we demonstrated that some small-molecule modulators of Sigma1 alter endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein homeostasis pathways in cancer cells, including the unfolded protein response and autophagy. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is cotranslationally inserted into the ER and is processed and transported through the secretory pathway. Once at the surface of cancer cells, PD-L1 acts as a T-cell inhibitory checkpoint molecule and suppresses antitumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate that in Sigma1-expressing triple-negative breast and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, PD-L1 protein levels were suppressed by RNAi knockdown of Sigma1 and by small-molecule inhibition of Sigma1. Sigma1-mediated action was confirmed by pharmacologic competition between Sigma1-selective inhibitor and activator ligands. When administered alone, the Sigma1 inhibitor decreased cell surface PD-L1 expression and suppressed functional interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 in a coculture of T cells and cancer cells. Conversely, the Sigma1 activator increased PD-L1 cell surface expression, demonstrating the ability to positively and negatively modulate Sigma1 associated PD-L1 processing. We discovered that the Sigma1 inhibitor induced degradation of PD-L1 via autophagy, by a mechanism distinct from bulk macroautophagy or general ER stress-associated autophagy. Finally, the Sigma1 inhibitor suppressed IFNŒ≥-induced PD-L1. Our data demonstrate that small-molecule Sigma1 modulators can be used to regulate PD-L1 in cancer cells and trigger its degradation by selective autophagy.Implications: Sigma1 modulators sequester and eliminate PD-L1 by autophagy, thus preventing functional PD-L1 expression at the cell surface. This posits Sigma1 modulators as novel therapeutic agents in PD-L1/PD-1 blockade strategies that regulate the tumor immune microenvironment.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/16/2/243/F1.large.jpg Mol Cancer Res; 16(2); 243-55. ¬©2017 AACR.""","""['Christina M Maher', 'Jeffrey D Thomas', 'Derick A Haas', 'Charles G Longen', 'Halley M Oyer', 'Jane Y Tong', 'Felix J Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Sigma1 Targeting to Suppress Aberrant Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Nafamostat mesilate, a serine protease inhibitor, suppresses interferon-gamma-induced up-regulation of programmed cell death ligand 1 in human cancer cells.', 'The IFN-Œ≥/PD-L1 axis between T cells and tumor microenvironment: hints for glioma anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.', 'PD-L1/PD-1 axis as a potent therapeutic target in breast cancer.', 'Sigma1 Pharmacology in the Context of Cancer.', 'Regulation of post-translational modification of PD-L1 and advances in tumor immunotherapy.', 'Defining the ligand-dependent proximatome of the sigma 1 receptor.', 'Regulation of PD-L1 Trafficking from Synthesis to Degradation.', 'Functional binding of PD1 ligands predicts response to anti-PD1 treatment in patients with cancer.', 'Autophagy and Breast Cancer: Connected in Growth, Progression, and Therapy.']"""

Here, we propose to use a randomized clinical pilot study to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of implementing ERAS versus standard protocols (SP) in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion.  Methods:   27 consecutive patients undergoing RC were included in the study. 12 patients were prospectively randomized to follow an ERAS protocol and 15 patients followed an SP. Duration of hospital stay, time to first flatulence and bowel movement, complications and 30 day readmission rates, as well as subjective outcomes such as postoperative pain, nausea, bowel symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and patient experience and satisfaction were evaluated.  Results:   Patients following ERAS had a significantly shorter: hospital stay, time to flatulence, and time to bowel movement than patients following SP. No major complications were reported. Only one patient in the ERAS group was readmitted for bowel obstruction, and no patients were readmitted in the SP group. Patients under ERAS reported lower postoperative pain scores. Mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bladder Cancer score decreased and mean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, bowel symptom score increased in the SP group at the time of discharge compared to prior to surgery.

Firstly, miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P expression was aberrantly upregulated in human CRC tumor tissues compared with controls. Further results demonstrated that the proliferation capacity of human CRC SW480 and LoVo cells was significantly increased by an miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P specific mimic, and was inhibited by miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P silencing. Conversely, the apoptosis of human CRC cells was remarkably decreased by miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P mimic, and enhanced by miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P suppression compared with control. Additionally, it was observed that there was a potential binding site of miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P on the 3'‚Äëuntranslated region of Prostate apoptosis responde‚Äë4 (Par4) and miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P may directly target Par4 mRNA. In human CRC cells, an miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P inhibitor significantly upregulated Par 4 expression, however the miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P mimic reduced Par4expression. Furthermore, Par4 expression exhibited an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of CRC cells transfected with miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P mimic, and exhibited a promoting role in the repressed apoptosis by miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P mimic. Inconclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR‚Äë17‚Äë3P is important in CRC cell survival by targeting Par4, indicating a novel finding regarding human CRC progression.""","""['Debao Lu', 'Liang Tang', 'Yan Zhuang', 'Peng Zhao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['miR-107 Promotes Proliferation and Inhibits Apoptosis of Colon Cancer Cells by Targeting Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (Par4).', 'Erratum.', 'miR-19a promotes colorectal cancer proliferation and migration by targeting TIA1.', 'MicroRNA-92a Promotes Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth and Migration by Inhibiting KLF4.', 'Histone demethylase PHF8 accelerates the progression of colorectal cancer and can be regulated by miR-488 in\xa0vitro.', 'Silencing hsa_circ_0049271 attenuates hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-induced myocardial cell injury via the miR-17-3p/FZD4 signaling axis.', ""Cancer and Alzheimer's Inverse Correlation: an Immunogenetic Analysis."", 'PARs in the inflammation-cancer transformation of CRC.', 'Effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation on mitochondrial functions and transcriptional profiles of isolated brain and muscle porcine cells.', 'MiR-17-3p Facilitates Aggressive Cell Phenotypes in Colon Cancer by Targeting PLCD1 Through Affecting KIF14.']"""

However, the majority of PCas remains indolent from several months to several years before malignancy. Current diagnosis methods have limitations in their reliability and are inefficient in time cost. Thus, an efficient in vivo PCa cell xenograft model is highly desired for diagnostic studies in PCas. In the present study we present a standardized procedure to create a PCa cell xenograft model using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as the host. PC3-CTR cells, a cell line from adenocarcinoma with stable expression of calcitonin receptor (CRT), were subcutaneously injected into zebrafish larvae at 48 h post fertilization. The nursing conditions for the larvae were optimized with stable survival rates of post hatch and post PC3-CTR cell injection. In this system, the progression of PC3-CTR cells in vivo was evaluated by migration and proliferation of the cells. Massive migrations of PC3 cells in vivo were observed at post injection day (PID)3. The injected PC3-CTR cells eventually invaded the whole larval zebrafish at PID5. Quantification of PC3-CTR cell proliferation was done using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis targeting the expression profiles of two PCa housekeeping genes, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) encoding genes. The excessive proliferation of PC3 cells in vivo was detected with both qPCR assays. Expression levels of one non‚Äëcoding gene, prostate cancer associated 3 gene (pca3), and two other genes encoding transient receptor potential ion channel Melastatin 8 (trpm8) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma), showed a significantly enhanced aggressiveness of PC3-CTR cells in vivo. The model established in the present study provides an improved in vivo model for the diagnosis of PCas efficiently.

Regarding this, we carefully reinvestigated this issue using human normal prostate (PrEC, PrSC, PrSMC) and prostate cancer (DU145, LNCaP, PC3) cell lines. Expression of leptin receptor isoforms was assessed by qPCR while the effects of leptin on cell proliferative activity was determined by real-time cell analyzer (RTCA). Expression of the leptin receptor variant 1 was not detected in LNCaP and PrSMC cell lines, but it was found in the remaining cell lines. In contrast, in all examined cell lines, isoforms 1-3 and 2 and 4 of the leptin receptor were found. The expression of isoforms 3 and 6 of the leptin receptor was observed in PC3, PrEC, PrSMC and PrSC cell lines, but not in LNCaP and DU145 cells. Expression of the leptin receptor isoforms 4-6 and 5 was not demonstrated in any of the tested cell lines. We also studied the effects of leptin on the expression of its receptor isoforms in all tested cell lines. At a wide range of concentrations, leptin did not change the expression of leptin receptor variant 1 in the DU145, PrEC and PC3 cell lines. In contrast, in the PrSC cell line, leptin significantly increased the expression of this gene. In all prostate cell lines tested, leptin did not alter the expression levels of variants 1-3 of the leptin receptor isoforms. Leptin did not alter the expression of isoforms 2 and 4 of the leptin receptor in the PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. In the DU145 and PrEC cell lines, leptin inhibited expression of these receptor isoforms while an opposite effect was noted in the PrSC cells. Leptin did not affect the expression level of variants 3 and 6 of its receptor in the PrEC and PC3 cell lines. However, in PrSMC cells, leptin inhibited the expression of variants 3 and 6 of its receptor, while in the PrSC cell line this cytokine significantly increased their expression levels. As assessed by RTCA, leptin stimulated the proliferative activity of DU145 cells, but inhibited this activity in LNCaP cells. At all concentrations tested, leptin did not change the proliferation rate of the PC3, PrEC and PrSMC cells. In contrast, leptin notably stimulated the proliferative activity of the PrSC (prostate stromal cell) cell line. Thus, our study demonstrated that in all tested human normal prostate and prostate cancer cell lines, transcription variants 4, 5 and 6 of the leptin receptor were not expressed. Leptin receptor transcription variants 1, 2 and 3 showed differential expression, which was present in the PC3, PrEC and PrSC cell lines.

Studies have demonstrated that Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) can inhibit cancer. Therefore the present study investigated the effect and molecular mechanism of GLP on cell growth and migration of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. LNCaP cells were transfected with either a protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) overexpression plasmid or PRMT6 small interfering (si)RNA. The cell growth and migration, and the expression of PRMT6 signaling‚Äëassociated proteins, were investigated following treatment with 5 and 20 ¬µg/ml GLP. The results demonstrated that GLP inhibited cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest, decreased PRMT6, cyclin‚Äëdependent kinase 2 (CDK2), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and steroid receptor coactivator, (SRC) expression, and increased p21 expression in LNCaP cells, as determined by using a Coulter counter, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription‚Äëquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, GLP significantly inhibited cell migration, as determined by Transwell migration and scratch assays, and altered CDK2, FAK, SRC and p21 expression in LNCaP cells transfected with the PRMT6 overexpression plasmid. By contrast, PRMT6 knockdown by siRNA reduced the effect of GLP on cell migration. These results indicate that GLP was effective in inhibiting cell growth, the cell cycle and cell migration, and the suppressive effect of GLP on cell migration may occur via the PRMT6 signaling pathway. Therefore, it is suggested that GLP may act as a tumor suppressor with applications in the treatment of prostate cancer. The results of the present study provide both the preliminary theoretical and experimental basis for the investigation of GLP as a therapeutic agent.""","""['Xiaohui Zhao', 'Dayu Zhou', 'Yunen Liu', 'Chun Li', 'Xiaoguang Zhao', 'Ying Li', 'Wei Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Ganoderma Lucidum Polysaccharide, an Extract from Ganoderma Lucidum, Exerts Suppressive Effect on Cervical Cancer Cell Malignancy through Mitigating Epithelial-Mesenchymal and JAK/STAT5 Signaling Pathway.', 'Effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 on Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides-induced apoptosis of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides target a Fas/caspase dependent pathway to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells.', 'Histone methyltransferase PRMT6 plays an oncogenic role of in prostate cancer.', 'The Emerging Role of PRMT6 in Cancer.', 'Research Progress on the Anticancer Activities and Mechanisms of Polysaccharides From Ganoderma.', 'Narrative Review: Bioactive Potential of Various Mushrooms as the Treasure of Versatile Therapeutic Natural Product.', 'Antimetastatic Effects of Ganoderma lucidum Polysaccharide Peptide on B16-F10-luc-G5 Melanoma Mice With Sleep Fragmentation.', 'Macrofungi as a Nutraceutical Source: Promising Bioactive Compounds and Market Value.', 'Pharmacological Effects of Guava (Psidium guajava L.)

Through cell cycle analyses, it was demonstrated that LDIR inhibited cell growth and arrested the cell cycle at the S and G2/M phases in PC-3 cells, but not in RWPE-1 cells. Using western blotting, it was demonstrated that LDIR at 75 mGy induced the expression of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein in PC-3 as well as RWPE-1 cells. However, the ATMÃ∏p21 pathway was activated in PC-3, but not in RWPE-1 cells.

In addition, when using ATM inhibitors, the ATMÃ∏p21 pathway was inactivated in both cell lines, and the LDIR-induced cell proliferation inhibition was also abolished. These findings suggested that the ATM/p21 pathway directly participated in the LDIR-induced cell proliferation inhibition in p53null type prostate tumor cells, whereas this mechanism was absent in normal prostate cells.

After adjustment for confounders, an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer [HR (95% CI) for quintile (Q) 5 vs. Q1] was found for the dietary intake of total isoflavones [1.91 (1.25-2.92)], genistein [1.51 (1.02-2.22), daidzein [1.80 (1.18-2.75) and glycitein [1.67 (1.15-2.43)] (p-trend for all associations ‚â§0.05). For example, HR (95% CI) for comparing the Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5 with Q1 of daidzein intake was 1.45 (0.93-2.25), 1.65 (1.07-2.54), 1.73 (1.13-2.66) and 1.80 (1.18-2.75), respectively (p-trend: 0.013). No statistically significant associations were observed between the intake of total isoflavones and individual phytoestrogens and non-advanced and total prostate cancer after adjustment for confounders.

This study investigates the association between warfarin use and cancer incidence in a large, unselected population-based cohort.  Objective:   To examine the association between warfarin use and cancer incidence.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study with subgroup analysis used the Norwegian National Registry coupled with the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Cancer Registry of Norway. The cohort comprised all persons (N = 1 256 725) born between January 1, 1924, and December 31, 1954, who were residing in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012. The cohort was divided into 2 groups-warfarin users and nonusers; persons taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were the subgroup. Data were collected from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012. Data analysis was conducted from October 15, 2016, to January 31, 2017.  Exposures:   Warfarin use was defined as taking at least 6 months of a prescription and at least 2 years from first prescription to any cancer diagnosis. If warfarin treatment started after January 1, 2006, each person contributed person-time in the nonuser group until the warfarin user criteria were fulfilled.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cancer diagnosis of any type during the 7-year observation period (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012).  Results:   Of the 1 256 725 persons in the cohort, 607 350 (48.3%) were male, 649 375 (51.7%) were female, 132 687 (10.6%) had cancer, 92 942 (7.4%) were classified as warfarin users, and 1 163 783 (92.6%) were classified as nonusers. Warfarin users were older, with a mean (SD) age of 70.2 (8.2) years, and were predominantly men (57 370 [61.7%]) as compared with nonusers, who had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (8.6) years and were mostly women (613 803 [52.7%]). Among warfarin users and compared with nonusers, there was a significantly lower age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) in all cancer sites (IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and in prevalent organ-specific sites (lung, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75-0.86]; prostate, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.65-0.72]; and breast, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-1.00]). There was no observed significant effect in colon cancer (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.06). In a subgroup analysis of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the IRR was lower in all cancer sites (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.59-0.65) and in prevalent sites (lung, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.33-0.46]; prostate, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.55-0.66]; breast, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87]; and colon, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Warfarin use may have broad anticancer potential in a large, population-based cohort of persons older than 50 years.

Participants were stratified (baseline PSADT, Gleason score) and randomly assigned 1:2:2 to receive placebo, 500 mg MPX (low), or 4,000 mg MPX (high) daily. Correlates included superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) genotype, lipid peroxidation, and polyphenol pharmacokinetics.Results: The evaluable population included 112 patients, all treated for at least 6 months and 62% treated for 12 months. No significant difference was found in PSADT change between control and treatment arms (P = 0.81): control 0.9 months (n = 20; range, 6.7-83.1), low dose 1.5 months (n = 52; range, 10.3-87.2), high dose 0.9 months (n = 40; range, 27.3-88.1). One high-dose patient experienced objective response. No drug-related CTCAE grade 3-4 adverse events were seen. In a preplanned exploratory analysis, PSADT pre-to-post increase was significant in the 27 (26%) genotyped patients with SOD2 Alanine/Alanine genotype (rs4880 T>C polymorphism) on MPX (pooled treatment arms; 6.4 months, P = 0.02), but not in control (1.8 months, P = 0.25).Conclusions: Compared with placebo, MPX did not significantly prolong PSADT in BCR patients over two different doses.

Methods and materials:   Five radiation oncologists contoured rectums in 10 patients on transperineal ultrasound image sets after establishing a delineation consensus. The D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc rectum volume parameters were determined. The mean, standard deviation, and range of each dose-volume histogram parameter were evaluated for each patient. The IOV was determined using the coefficient of variation, and the dosimetric impacts on the total dose were analyzed by estimating the biologically equivalent dose (EQD2Œ±/Œ≤ = 3).  Results:   The interobserver coefficients of variation (¬±standard deviation) for the reported D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc were 5 ¬± 1.84%, 4 ¬± 1.26%, and 4 ¬± 1.33%, respectively.

Methods:   We identified 237 patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer diagnosed from 1990 to 2012 who did not undergo immediate DT within 12 months of diagnosis (ie, AS patients as well as watchful waiting and those refusing DT).

The impact of DT on oncologic outcomes of biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis, disease-specific (DSS), and overall survival (OS) was examined with the Cox proportional hazards model, along with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.  Results:   After median time on AS of 63.4 months, 40% of patients underwent DT: 47% XRT, 28% RP, 14% ADT, and 11% cryotherapy. On multivariable analysis, the use of XRT predicted higher BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 6.1, P = .001) and worse overall mortality (HR 2.1, P = .03) compared with other treatments, controlling for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), stage, Gleason score, and NCCN risk category. Median follow-up was 71.7 months. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, 10-year OS was superior for RP versus XRT among patients with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) velocity >2.0 ng/mL/y.

Patients and methods:   A total of 328,710 individuals who received radical prostatectomy between the years 2004 and 2013 were identified within the National Cancer Data Base. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the statistical significance of temporal trends. Logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between the number of lymph nodes removed (LNR) and pN1 rate.  Results:   Most patients had T2 disease (76.7%) and a Gleason score of 7 (55.9%). Overall, 63.5% of the patients received PLND; this ranged between 58.9% and 72.1% over the study period (P = .8). In patients receiving PLND, mean LNR increased from 6.1 nodes in 2004 to 7.2 nodes in 2013 (P < .001). When stratified by tumor risk, utilization and extent of PLND increased in intermediate- and high-risk tumors, while it decreased in low-risk tumors. Overall pN1 rate was 3.73%, and it increased from 2.9% to 5.3% between 2004 and 2013 (P < .001). In multivariable analysis, LNR was an independent predictor of pN1 (P < .001).  Conclusion:   The utilization patterns of PLND in the United States have improved, with an increased focus on patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. Likewise, the extent of PLND has improved to include more lymph nodes.

The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is important for human prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis, and also drives tumorigenesis in mouse models. Loss of Smad4 has also been found in human prostate cancer and drives tumorigenesis and metastasis when coupled with other genetic aberrations in mouse models. In this work, we concurrently deleted Smad4 and the tumor suppressor and endogenous Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) in luminal prostate cells in mice. This double conditional knockout model produced invasive castration-resistant prostate carcinoma with no evidence of metastasis. We observed mixed differentiation phenotypes, including basaloid and squamous differentiation. Interestingly, tumor cells in this model commonly lose androgen receptor expression. In addition, tumors disappear in these mice during androgen cycling (castration followed by testosterone reintroduction).

Gemcitabine is an important chemotherapeutic agent that has been approved for the treatment of numerous human solid tumors, including HIPC, whereas the gemcitabine resistance has become a serious problem in clinical chemotherapy. In the present study, the mechanisms of resistance to gemcitabine were investigated in HIPC cell lines. The results demonstrated that the autophagy markers were induced significantly in HIPC cells subsequent to gemcitabine treatment. Meanwhile, administration of gemcitabine to HIPC cells increased the expression of high mobility group box1 (HMGB1). Furthermore, the gemcitabine-induced autophagy response was attenuated in stable HIPC cells harboring HMGB1 shRNA. Notably, the HIPC cells stably transfected with HMGB1 shRNA or treated with autophagy inhibitors were more sensitive to gemcitabine compared with the control group. These data suggested that inhibition of HMGB1 increased the sensitivity to gemcitabine by decreasing autophagy response in HIPC cells.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2015 and July 2016, a total of 977 consecutively seen men underwent multiparametric prostate MRI, and 342 underwent MRI-ultrasound (US) fusion targeted biopsy. A total of 474 lesions were retrospectively reviewed, and 111 were scored as PI-RADS category 3 and were visualized using a 3-T MRI scanner. Multiparametric prostate MR images were prospectively interpreted by body subspecialty radiologists trained to use PI-RADS version 2. CSC was defined as a Gleason score of at least 7 on targeted biopsy. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to identify the RFs associated with CSC.  Results:   Of the 111 PI-RADS category 3 lesions, 81 (73.0%) were benign, 11 (9.9%) were clinically insignificant (Gleason score, 6), and 19 (17.1%) were clinically significant. On multivariate analysis, three RFs were identified as significant predictors of CSC: older patient age (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; p = 0.002), smaller prostate volume (OR, 0.94; p = 0.008), and abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings (OR, 3.92; p = 0.03). For PI-RADS category 3 lesions associated with zero, one, two, or three RFs, the risk of CSC was 4%, 16%, 62%, and 100%, respectively. PI-RADS category 3 lesions for which two or more RFs were noted (e.g., age ‚â• 70 years, gland size ‚â§ 36 mL, or abnormal DRE findings) had a CSC detection rate of 67% with a sensitivity of 53%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 67%, and a negative predictive value of 91%.  Conclusion:   Incorporating clinical parameters into risk stratification algorithms may improve the ability to detect clinically significant disease among PI-RADS category 3 lesions and may aid in the decision to perform biopsy.""","""['Alison D Sheridan', 'Sameer K Nath', 'Jamil S Syed', 'Sanjay Aneja', 'Preston C Sprenkle', 'Jeffrey C Weinreb', 'Michael Spektor']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Reply to ""Prostate Cancer and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 3 Lesions Identified at Multiparametric Prostate MRI"".', 'Prostate Cancer and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 3 Lesions Identified at Multiparametric Prostate MRI.', 'MRI-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 Category 5 Lesions Found False-Positive at Multiparametric Prostate MRI.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'PI-RADS Version 2 Category on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Oncologic Outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.', 'A practical primer on PI-RADS version 2: a pictorial essay.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: a critical review and discussion of how to improve management.', 'Predictors of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Patients with PIRADS Categories 3-5 Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of the Prostate.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values of hypoechoic lesions matched with target lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Paradigm Shift in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Pre-Biopsy Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Targeted Biopsy.', 'Evaluating the performance of clinical and radiological data in predicting prostate cancer in prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2.1 category 3 lesions of the peripheral and the transition zones.']"""

A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, and thematic analysis was undertaken. Some participants perceived a stigma associated with prostate cancer and cancer in general, which sometimes acted as a barrier to disclosure. Self-blame and internalisation of cause was not a prominent issue. Participants' descriptions of emotional distress, social isolation and anxiety demonstrated the impact of prostate cancer. Social isolation was most commonly reported as a physical consequence of treatment and/or side effects. Participants felt both support and ongoing care were limited at post-treatment. Most did not seek or receive help for emotional or psychosocial problems from a formal source due to anticipated awkwardness, autonomous coping, not burdening others, unwanted sympathy and retaining privacy. Prostate cancer can cause considerable emotional and social burden for some men, and many are unlikely to seek or receive help.

Current toxicity summaries are ad hoc and do not distinguish among the severities and types of toxicities. Here a clinically feasible method for estimating the toxicity burden, based on a prospective evaluation of the toxicity profile of a randomized clinical trial of 746 prostate cancer patients conducted by SWOG, is proposed.  Methods:   For 308 patients who experienced severe toxicities, 2 physicians randomly selected from 14 physicians evaluated each toxicity profile and assigned a visual analogue scale score (0-10) based on their impression of the global burden of toxicities. With mixed-effects models, severity scores and a 10-point toxicity burden score (TBS) were derived from 27 predictors accounting for severe (grade 3) and life-threatening (grade 4) toxicities for each organ class of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  Results:   For most organ classes, grade 3 toxicities had a TBS of 4.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.65-4.63), but infections, cardiovascular events, and pulmonary events had a higher TBS with differences of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.53-1.21), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.51-1.25), and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.22-1.24), respectively. Moreover, most grade 4 events had a higher TBS than grade 3 events, except for hemorrhaging, pain, metabolic events, and musculoskeletal events. The intrarater and interrater correlations were 0.91 and 0.59, respectively.  Conclusions:   The burden of toxicity grades differs with toxicity types. A TBS provides a toxicity burden summary that incorporates physicians' perspectives and differentiates between severe and life-threatening toxicities and organ classes.

An accurate prediction model to identify patient groups that will benefit from abiraterone treatment is therefore urgently required. The Chi model exhibits a good profile for risk classification, although its utility for the chemotherapy-naive group is unclear. This study aimed to externally validate the Chi model and develop a new nomogram to predict overall survival (OS). We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 110 patients. Patients were distributed among good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups, according to the Chi model. The good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups had a sample size of 59 (53.6%), 34 (30.9%), and 17 (15.5%) in our dataset, and a median OS of 48.4, 29.1, and 10.5 months, respectively. The C-index of external validation of Chi model was 0.726. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified low hemoglobin concentrations (<110 g l-1), liver metastasis, and a short time interval from androgen deprivation therapy to abiraterone initiation (<36 months) as predictors of OS. Accordingly, a new nomogram was developed with a C-index equal to 0.757 (95% CI, 0.678-0.836).

Lyso-Phos acts as an indicator for lysosomal phosphatase. Its photophysical property including cellular imaging was described. Lyso-Phos showed ratiometric UV-Vis- absorption changes from Œªabs 370nm to Œªabs 450nm in the presence of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). On the other hand, fluorescence intensity Œªem 560nm of Lyso-Phos has increased around 45-fold in the presence of ALP. The probe Lyso-Phos was found to be highly chemoselective toward the phosphatase compared with other ubiquitous entities in cellular milieu. The non-toxic nature of the Lyso-phos has accounted by observing higher cell viability in prostate cancer- LnCap, fibrosarcoma HT1080 and normal mouse embryo fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. Further, the probe Lyso-Phos was utilized for tracking of cellular phosphatase in live-cells. Lyso-Phos enabled to track cellular phosphatase by the extent of fluorescence labeling of LnCap cells which showed reasonable uptake efficiency in the presence of Lyso-Phos as indicated by the intracellular fluorescence. The phosphoester bond in the probe was cleaved by intracellular alkaline phosphatase leading to turn on fluorescence of the fluorescent probe Lyso-Phos. Finally, cellular colocalization with Lyso-Tracker empowered our speculation that Lyso-Phos can track endogenous phosphatase in the lysosomes.

Aims:   To assess quality of life, psychological functioning, and treatment satisfaction of men who underwent penile implantation after RP; the psychosocial correlates of treatment satisfaction and sexual function after surgery; and the relation between patients' and partners' ratings of treatment satisfaction.  Methods:   98 consecutive patients who underwent penile implantation after RP from 2010 and 2015 and their partners were invited to complete a series of measures at a single time point. Of these, 71 patients and 43 partners completed measures assessing sexual function, psychological functioning, and treatment satisfaction. Proportions of patients who demonstrated good sexual function and satisfaction with treatment and clinical levels of anxiety and depression were calculated. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine psychosocial factors associated with patient treatment satisfaction and sexual function and patient-partner differences in treatment satisfaction.  Outcomes:   Patients completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26), Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS), Prostate Cancer-Related Quality of Life Scale, Self-Esteem and Relationship Questionnaire (SEAR), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Partners completed the GAD-7, PHQ-9, EDITS (partner version), and SEAR.  Results:   94% of men reported satisfaction with treatment (EDITS score > 50). 77% of men reported good sexual function (EPIC-26 score > 60). Lower depression scores were associated with higher sexual confidence and sexual intimacy, and these were correlated with better treatment satisfaction and sexual function. Patients experienced higher sexual relationship satisfaction (median score = 90.6) than their partners (median score = 81.2), but there was no difference in treatment satisfaction between groups. Higher patient treatment satisfaction was more likely to be reported for couples whose depression scores were more similar.  Clinical implications:   It is important to provide preoperative penile implant counseling and encourage patients to seek postoperative counseling if needed.  Strengths and limitations:   This is one of the first Australian-based studies comprehensively assessing treatment satisfaction and psychosocial health of men after penile prosthesis surgery after RP. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, so there is a possibility of recall bias, and causal associations could not be determined.  Conclusion:   Men in this Australian series who underwent penile prosthesis surgery after RP generally reported good sexual function and treatment satisfaction.

Of 568 patients with bone metastases (weighted n = 421), most (73%) noticed pain before receiving a diagnosis of metastatic PC. Most patients with aPC (56%) were uncertain if their pain was cancer related, 55% felt they had to live with daily pain, 45% sometimes ignored pain, and 39% had difficulty talking about pain. Patients who had a caregiver were more likely than those without to discuss pain at every visit (45% vs. 32%, P < .05).  Conclusions:   Disease symptoms in aPC are often underrecognized.

Here, the development of such a system using MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) detectors and experience gained during 2 years of use are reported with focus on the performance of the MOSFET detectors.  Methods and materials:   A bolus phantom was constructed with two implants, mimicking prostate and head & neck treatments, using steel needles and plastic catheters to guide the 192Ir source and house the MOSFET detectors. The phantom was taken through the BT treatment chain from image acquisition to dose evaluation. During the 2-year evaluation-period, delivered doses were verified a total of 56 times using MOSFET detectors which had been calibrated in an external 60Co beam. An initial experimental investigation on beam quality differences between 192Ir and 60Co is reported.  Results:   The standard deviation in repeated MOSFET measurements was below 3% in the six measurement points with dose levels above 2 Gy. MOSFET measurements overestimated treatment planning system doses by 2-7%.

Exploiting the full planning potential of MCO navigation, this alternative planning approach intends to improve planning efficiency and individual plan quality.  Methods:   Planning was retrospectively performed on 12 brain tumor and 10 post-prostatectomy prostate patients previously treated with MCO-IMRT. For each patient, physicians were provided with a template-based generated Pareto surface of optimal plans to navigate, using the beam angles from the original clinical plans. We compared physician generated plans to clinically delivered plans (created by dosimetrists) in terms of dosimetric differences, physician preferences and planning times.  Results:   Plan qualities were similar, however physician generated and clinical plans differed in the prioritization of clinical goals. Physician derived prostate plans showed significantly better sparing of the high dose rectum and bladder regions (p(D1) < 0.05; D1: dose received by 1% of the corresponding structure). Physicians' brain tumor plans indicated higher doses for targets and brainstem (p(D1) < 0.05). Within blinded plan comparisons physicians preferred the clinical plans more often (brain: 6:3 out of 12, prostate: 2:6 out of 10) (not statistically significant). While times of physician involvement were comparable for prostate planning, the new workflow reduced the average involved time for brain cases by 30%. Planner times were reduced for all cases. Subjective benefits, such as a better understanding of planning situations, were observed by clinicians through the insight into plan optimization and experiencing dosimetric trade-offs.  Conclusions:   We introduce physician driven planning with MCO for brain and prostate tumors as a feasible planning workflow. The proposed approach standardizes the planning process by utilizing site specific templates and integrates physicians more tightly into treatment planning. Physicians' navigated plan qualities were comparable to the clinical plans. Given the reduction of planning time of the planner and the equal or lower planning time of physicians, this approach has the potential to improve departmental efficiencies.""","""['Birgit S M√ºller', 'Helen A Shih', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Thomas Bortfeld', 'David Craft']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Maximizing dosimetric benefits of IMRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer through multicriteria optimization planning.', 'Multicriteria optimization: Site-specific class solutions for VMAT plans.', 'Advantages and limitations of navigation-based multicriteria optimization (MCO) for localized prostate cancer IMRT planning.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning: Present and Future.', 'Obstacles and advances in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Assessment of Knowledge-Based Planning Model in Combination with Multi-Criteria Optimization in Head-and-Neck Cancers.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Multi-criteria optimization for planning volumetric-modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy for Skull Base Meningiomas Using HyperArc and Multicriteria Optimization.', 'Real-time interactive planning for radiotherapy of head and neck cancer with volumetric modulated arc therapy.']"""

In this study, we examined whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) enhanced the effect of docetaxel on AR signaling in CRPC cells harboring AR and its splice variants. Methods HDACIs (vorinostat and CG200745) were tested for their ability to enhance the effects of docetaxel on cell viability and inhibition of AR signaling in CRPC 22Rv1 and VCaP cells by using CellTiter-Glo‚Ñ¢ Luminescent cell viability assay, synergy index analysis and Western blotting. The nuclear localization of AR was examined via immunocytochemical staining in 22Rv1 cells and primary tumor cells from a patient with CRPC. Results Combination treatment with HDACIs (vorinostat or CG200745) and docetaxel synergistically inhibited the growth of 22Rv1 and VCaP cells. Consistently, the combination treatment decreased the levels of full-length AR (AR-FL), AR splice variants (AR-Vs), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins more efficiently compared with docetaxel or vorinostat alone. Moreover, the combination treatment accelerated the acetylation and bundling of tubulin, which significantly inhibited the nuclear accumulation of AR in 22Rv1 cells. The cytoplasmic colocalization of AR-FL and AR-V7 with microtubule bundles increased after combination treatment in primary tumor cells from a patient with CRPC. Conclusions The results suggested that docetaxel, in combination with HDACIs, suppressed the expression and nuclear translocation of AR-FL and AR-Vs and showed synergistic anti-proliferative effect in CRPC cells.

We analyzed the prognostic value of functional parameters such as mean standardized uptake volume (SUVmean), maximum standardized uptake volume (SUVmax), metabolic total volume (MTV; the volume of interest consisting of all spatially connected voxels within a fixed threshold of 40% of the SUVmax), and total lesion activity (TLA: the product of MTV and mean standardized uptake value) estimated with FCH-PET/CT in mCRPC patients in progression after docetaxel and treated with new antiandrogen receptor therapies, abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Methods:   We retrospectively studied 94 mCRPC patients, mean age 74 years (range 42-90), previously treated with docetaxel who were treated with either abiraterone (n = 52) or enzalutamide (n = 42). An FCH-PET/CT was performed at baseline, and patients were evaluated on a monthly basis for serological PSA response and every 3 months for radiological response. We measured MTV, SUVmean, SUVmax and TLA for each lesion and analyzed the sum of MTV (SMTV), SUVmean (SSUVmean), SUVmax (SSUVmax) and TLA (STLA) values for a maximum of 20 lesions. Univariate analysis was used to correlate these data with PFS and OS.  Results:   We observed a median SMTV of 130 cm3, median SSUVmax of 106.5 and a median STLA of 495,070. All of these parameters were significant for PFS and OS in univariate analysis, while only STLA was significant for PFS and OS in multivariate analysis after adjusting for lesion and age (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively).

So far, biomarkers for pathological conditions have been mainly searched from their protein, (mi)RNA, DNA and lipid cargo. Here, we explored the small molecule metabolites from urinary and platelet EVs relative to their matched source samples. As a proof-of-concept study of intra-EV metabolites, we compared alternative normalization methods to profile urinary EVs from prostate cancer patients before and after prostatectomy and from healthy controls.  Methods:   We employed targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to profile over 100 metabolites in the isolated EVs, original urine samples and platelets. We determined the enrichment of the metabolites in the EVs and analyzed their subcellular origin, pathways and relevant enzymes or transporters through data base searches. EV- and urine-derived factors and ratios between metabolites were tested for normalization of the metabolomics data.  Results:   Approximately 1 x 1010 EVs were sufficient for detection of metabolite profiles from EVs. The profiles of the urinary and platelet EVs overlapped with each other and with those of the source materials, but they also contained unique metabolites. The EVs enriched a selection of cytosolic metabolites including members from the nucleotide and spermidine pathways, which linked to a number of EV-resident enzymes or transporters. Analysis of the urinary EVs from the patients indicated that the levels of glucuronate, D-ribose 5-phosphate and isobutyryl-L-carnitine were 2-26-fold lower in all pre-prostatectomy samples compared to the healthy control and post-prostatectomy samples (p < 0.05). These changes were only detected from EVs by normalization to EV-derived factors or with metabolite ratios, and not from the original urine samples.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that metabolite analysis of EVs from different samples is feasible using a high-throughput platform and relatively small amount of sample material. With the knowledge about the specific enrichment of metabolites and normalization methods, EV metabolomics could be used to gain novel biomarker data not revealed by the analysis of the original EV source materials.""","""['Maija Puhka', 'Maarit Takatalo', 'Maria-Elisa Nordberg', 'Sami Valkonen', 'Jatin Nandania', 'Maria Aatonen', 'Marjo Yliperttula', 'Saara Laitinen', 'Vidya Velagapudi', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Pia R-M Siljander', 'Taija Maria Af H√§llstr√∂m']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Chromatography and its hyphenation to mass spectrometry for extracellular vesicle analysis.', 'Ultrafiltration combing with phospholipid affinity-based isolation for metabolomic profiling of urinary extracellular vesicles.', 'Enrichment of extracellular vesicles from tissues of the central nervous system by PROSPR.', 'Metabolomic profiling of urine-derived extracellular vesicles from rat model of drug-induced acute kidney injury.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles: bridging the communications between obesity and tumor microenvironment.', 'Genome-wide mRNA profiling in urinary extracellular vesicles reveals stress gene signature for diabetic kidney disease.', 'Metabolomic investigation of urinary extracellular vesicles for early detection and screening of lung cancer.', 'Metabolomics Analysis of Urinary Extracellular Vesicles by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.', 'Enhancing clinical potential of liquid biopsy through a multi-omic approach: A systematic review.']"""

However, relatively little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying aberrant BET overexpression in human cancers. Recently, we reported that prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote BRD4 degradation, leading to accumulation of BRD4 in prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   The heat was applied using an 8-MHz radiofrequency-capacitive device. The insulator sheet was inserted between the regular bolus and cooled overlay bolus in each of upper and lower side of the electrode. Several settings using the insulator sheets were investigated in an experimental study using an agar phantom to evaluate the temperature distributions. The specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions in several organs were also computed for the three-dimensional patient model. In a clinical prospective study, a total of five heating sessions were scheduled for the pelvic tumours, to assess the thermal parameters. The conventional setting was used during the first, third and fifth treatment sessions, and insulator sheets were used during the second and fourth treatment sessions.  Results:   In the phantom study, the higher heating area improved towards the centre when the mobile insulator sheets were used. The subcutaneous fat/target ratios for the averaged SARs in the setting with the mobile insulator (median, 2.5) were significantly improved compared with those in the conventional setting (median, 3.4). In the clinical study, the thermal dose parameters of CEM43¬∞CT90 in the sessions with the mobile insulator sheets (median, 1.9 min) were significantly better than those in the sessions using a conventional setting (median, 1.0 min).  Conclusions:   Our novel heating method using mobile insulator sheets was thus found to improve the thermal dose parameters.

While the down regulation of PrKD1 by DNA methylation in gastric cancer and by nuclear beta-catenin in colon cancer has been shown, the regulatory mechanisms in other cancers are unknown. Because we had demonstrated that PrKD1 is the only known kinase to phosphorylate threonine 120 (T120) of beta-catenin in prostate cancer resulting in increased nuclear beta-catenin, we explored the role of beta-catenin in gene regulation of PrKD1. An initial CHIP assay identified potential binding sites for beta-catenin in and downstream of PrKD1 promoter and sequencing confirmed recruitment of beta-catenin to a 166 base pairs sequence upstream of exon 2. Co-transfection studies with PrKD1-promoter-reporter suggested that beta-catenin represses PrKD1 promoter. Efforts to identify transcription factors that mediate the co-repressor effects of beta-catenin identified recruitment of both MYC and its obligate heterodimer MAX to the same binding site as beta-catenin on the PrKD1 promoter site. Moreover, treatment with MYC inhibitor rescued the co-repressor effect of beta-catenin on PrKD1 gene expression. Prostate specific knock out of PrKD1 in transgenic mice demonstrated increased nuclear expression of beta-catenin validating the in vitro studies. Functional studies showed that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin as a consequence of PrKD1 down regulation, increases AR transcriptional activity with attendant downstream effects on androgen responsive genes. In silico human gene expression analysis confirmed the down regulation of PrKD1 in metastatic prostate cancer correlated inversely with the expression of MAX, but not MYC, and positively with MXD1, a competing heterodimer of MAX, suggesting that the dimerization of MAX with either MYC or MXD1 regulates PrKD1 gene expression. The study has identified a novel auto-repressive loop that perpetuates PrKD1 down regulation through beta-catenin/MYC/MAX protein complex.""","""['Bita Nickkholgh', 'Sivanandane Sittadjody', 'Michael B Rothberg', 'Xiaolan Fang', 'Kunzhao Li', 'Jeff W Chou', 'Gregory A Hawkins', 'K C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', ""3JC48-3 (methyl 4'-methyl-5-(7-nitrobenzoc1,2,5oxadiazol-4-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-3-carboxylate): a novel MYC/MAX dimerization inhibitor reduces prostate cancer growth."", ""Molecular cloning, epigenetic regulation, and functional characterization of Prkd1 gene promoter in dopaminergic cell culture models of Parkinson's disease."", 'Elevated protein expression of cyclin D1 and Fra-1 but decreased expression of c-Myc in human colorectal adenocarcinomas overexpressing beta-catenin.', 'The oncogenic role of protein kinase D3 in cancer.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', ""3JC48-3 (methyl 4'-methyl-5-(7-nitrobenzoc1,2,5oxadiazol-4-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-3-carboxylate): a novel MYC/MAX dimerization inhibitor reduces prostate cancer growth."", 'Phosphorylation-Dependent Regulation of WNT/Beta-Catenin Signaling.', 'Multifaceted Functions of Protein Kinase D in Pathological Processes and Human Diseases.', 'Inhibition of BRD4 suppresses the malignancy of breast cancer cells via regulation of Snail.']"""

IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) induction is initiated by stroma remodeling and could represent a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer. In previous studies a lead quinazoline-based Doxazosin¬Æ derivative, DZ-50, impaired prostate tumor growth by targeting proteins involved in focal adhesion, anoikis resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). This study demonstrates that DZ-50 increased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and decreased the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin in human prostate cancer cells. In DU-145 cells, the effect of DZ-50 on EMT towards mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) was inhibited by talin1 overexpression, a focal adhesion regulator promoting anoikis resistance and tumor invasion. DZ-50 treatment of human prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) downregulated IGFBP3 expression at mRNA and protein level. In TGF-Œ≤1 responsive LNCaPTŒ≤RII, TGF-Œ≤1 reversed DZ-50-induced MET by antagonizing the drug-induced decrease of nuclear IGFBP3. Furthermore, co-culture with CAFs promoted prostate cancer epithelial cell invasion, an effect that was significantly inhibited by DZ-50. Our findings demonstrate that the lead compound, DZ-50, inhibited the invasive properties of prostate cancer epithelial cells by targeting IGFBP3 and mediating EMT conversion to MET.

Study design:   Population-based study using cancer registry data.  Methods:   Data on incident cases of colorectal, lung, female breast, and prostate cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 were obtained from a population-based cancer registry covering a population of approximately 2.5 million people in the West of Scotland. Socio-economic circumstances were assessed based on postcode of residence at diagnosis, using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). For each cancer, crude and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated by quintile of SIMD score, and the number of excess cases associated with socio-economic deprivation was estimated.  Results:   93,866 cases met inclusion criteria, comprising 21,114 colorectal, 31,761 lung, 23,757 female breast, and 15,314 prostate cancers. Between 2001 and 2006, there was no consistent association between socio-economic circumstances and colorectal cancer incidence, but 2006-2012 saw an emerging deprivation gradient in both sexes. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for colorectal cancer between most deprived and least deprived increased from 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.16) to 1.24 (95% CI 1.11-1.39) during the study period. The incidence of lung cancer showed the strongest relationship with socio-economic circumstances, with inequalities widening across the study period among women from IRR 2.66 (95% CI 2.33-3.05) to 2.91 (95% CI 2.54-3.33) in 2001-03 and 2010-12, respectively. Breast and prostate cancer showed an inverse relationship with socio-economic circumstances, with lower incidence among people living in more deprived areas.  Conclusion:   Significant socio-economic inequalities remain in cancer incidence in the West of Scotland, and in some cases are increasing.

Objective:   To explore whether WPRT and/or ADT added to prostate bed radiation therapy (PBRT) improves freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) or distant metastases (DM).  Design, setting, and participants:   A database was compiled from 10 academic institutions of patients with postprostatectomy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >0.01 ng/ml; pT1-4, Nx/0, cM0; and Gleason score (GS) ‚â•7 treated between 1987 and 2013. Median follow-up was 51 mo.  Interventions:   WPRT and/or ADT in addition to PBRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   FFBF and DM were calculated using cumulative incidence estimation. Multivariable analysis (MVA) utilized cumulative incidence regression.  Results and limitation:   Median pre-SRT PSA was 0.5 ng/ml for 1861 patients. Median follow-up for patients not experiencing biochemical failure (BF) was 55 mo. MVA showed increased BF for PBRT versus WPRT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.82, p<0.001) and no ADT versus ADT (HR 1.70, p<0.001). WPRT was associated with a 5-yr FFBF of 62% versus 49% (p<0.001) for PBRT. ADT use was associated with improved 5-yr FFBF (55% vs 50%, p=0.012). No significant differences in DM cumulative incidence were found.  Conclusions:   For patients with GS ‚â•7 receiving SRT, clinicians should weigh FFBF benefits of WPRT and ADT against toxicities. Future studies should explore the impact of WPRT on quality of life, clinical progression, and overall survival.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective multicenter study on 718 patients with clinically determined organ-confined PCa treated at one of three Japanese academic institutions in 2011 (n = 338) or 2013 (n = 380). Two patient groups formed according to the treatment year were compared regarding the clinical characteristics of PCa, whether referred or screened at our hospital, comorbidities and surgical risk, and choice of primary treatment.  Results:   Distribution of PCa risk was not changed by the introduction of RALP. Use of RP increased by 70% (from 127 to 221 cases, p < 0.0001), whereas the number of those undergoing radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy decreased irrespective of the disease risk of PCa. Increased use of RP (from 34 to 100 cases) for intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients with mild perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 2) accounted for 70% of the total RP increase, whereas the number of low- or very low-risk PCa patients with high comorbidity scores (Charlson Index ‚â• 4) increased from 8 to 25 cases, accounting for 18%. Use of expectant management (active surveillance, watchful waiting) in very low-risk PCa patients was 15% in 2011 and 12% in 2013 (p = 0.791).  Conclusions:   Introduction of a robotic surgical system had little effect on the risk distribution of PCa. Use of RP increased, apparently due to increased indications in patients who are candidates for RP but have mild perioperative risk. Although small, there was an increase in the number of RPs performed on patients with severe comorbidities but with low-risk or very low-risk PCa.""","""['Takashi Kobayashi', 'Kent Kanao', 'Motoo Araki', 'Naoki Terada', 'Yasuyuki Kobayashi', 'Atsuro Sawada', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Shin Ebara', 'Toyohiko Watanabe', 'Tomomi Kamba', 'Makoto Sumitomo', 'Yasutomo Nasu', 'Osamu Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Current trends in patient enrollment for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in Belgium.', 'The effect of minimally invasive prostatectomy on practice patterns of American urologists.', 'Current Management of pT3b Prostate Cancer After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'New surgical approaches for clinically high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Effect of Early Postoperative Rehabilitation on Length of Hospital Stay after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', ""Impact of Robotic Technologies on Prostate Cancer Patients' Choice for Radical Treatment."", 'Mesorectal fat area as a useful predictor of the difficulty of robotic-assisted laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients who were scheduled for prostate biopsy to detect Pca (N = 377) filled out a baseline questionnaire about HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR25), ""big five"" personality traits (BFI-10), optimism (LOT-r), and self-efficacy (Decision Self-efficacy Scale) (t0). Patients with confirmed Pca (N = 126) filled out a follow-up questionnaire on HRQoL within 2 weeks after treatment was chosen but had not yet started (t1).  Results:   HRQoL declined between t0 and t1, reflected in impaired role and cognitive functioning, and elevated fatigue, constipation, and prostate-specific symptoms. Sexual activity and functioning improved. Baseline HRQoL scores were unrelated to the selection of a particular treatment, but for patients who chose a curative treatment, post-decision HRQoL showed a greater decline compared to patients who chose active surveillance. Optimism was associated with HRQoL at baseline; decisional self-efficacy was positively associated with HRQoL at follow-up. No associations between HRQoL and the ""big five"" personality traits were found.  Conclusion:   Patients who have undergone prostate biopsy and treatment decision-making for Pca experience a decline in HRQoL. Choosing treatment with a curative intent was associated with greater decline in HRQoL. Interventions aimed at optimism and decision self-efficacy could be helpful to reduce HRQoL impairment around the time of prostate biopsy and treatment decision-making.""","""['Maarten Cuypers', 'Romy E D Lamers', 'Erik B Cornel', 'Lonneke V van de Poll-Franse', 'Marieke de Vries', 'Paul J M Kil']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['A prospective study of health-related quality-of-life outcomes for patients with low-risk prostate cancer managed by active surveillance or radiation therapy.', 'Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'Quality of life after low-dose rate-brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma - long-term results and literature review on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 results in published brachytherapy series.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

Methods:   Patients who underwent live surgery during an international urological meeting organized in January 2017 were enrolled. Those with organ-confined prostate cancer underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patients with a single renal tumor underwent minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery. High-resolution (HR) imaging was obtained for all patients. Those with kidney tumors received contrast-enhanced CT scan with angiography; those with prostate cancer underwent mp-MRI. Images in DICOM format were processed by dedicated software. The first step was the rendering of a 3D virtual model. The models were then printed. They were presented during the live surgery of the urological meeting. All the participants and the operated patients were asked to fill a questionnaire about their opinion expressed in Likert scale (1-10) about the use and application of the 3D printed models.  Results:   18 patients were enrolled, including 8 undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and 10 undergoing minimally invasive partial nephrectomy. For each patient, a virtual 3D printed model was created. The attendants rated the utility of printed models in surgical planning, anatomical representation and the role of technology in surgical training as 8/10, 10/10 and 9/10, respectively. All patients reported favorable feedbacks (from 9 to 10/10) about the use of the technology during the case discussion with the surgeon.

Retention of interstitial genes between TMPRSS2 and ERG has been reported to influence tumor progression in an animal model. In this study, we analyzed the status of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genes and interstitial genes in tumors from a large cohort of men treated surgically for prostate cancer, associating alterations with biochemical progression. Through whole-genome mate pair sequencing, we mapped and classified rearrangements driving ETS family gene fusions in 133 cases of very low-, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer from radical prostatectomy specimens. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions were observed in 44% of cases, and over 90% of these fusions occurred in ERG exons 3 or 4. ERG fusions retaining interstitial sequences occurred more frequently in very low-risk tumors. These tumors also frequently displayed ERG gene fusions involving alternative 5'-partners to TMPRSS2, specifically SLC45A3 and NDRG1 and other ETS family genes, which retained interstitial TMPRSS2/ERG sequences. Lastly, tumors displaying TMPRSS2-ERG fusions that retained interstitial genes were less likely to be associated with biochemical recurrence (P = 0.028). Our results point to more favorable clinical outcomes in patients with ETS family fusion-positive prostate cancers, which retain potential tumor-suppressor genes in the interstitial regions between TMPRSS2 and ERG Identifying these patients at biopsy might improve patient management, particularly with regard to active surveillance.

Answering these questions is difficult because the number of EDs is large and varies with time. Moreover hormonal carcinogenesis is multifactorial and progresses slowly and in stages. This discussion will be limited to breast cancer and three EDs: distilbene, bisphenol A (BPA), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). All these three EDs bind estrogen receptors, albeit with widely different affinities. Several complementary approaches have been used: French cancer records, epidemiological studies on cohorts followed over several decades, numerous in vitro experimental studies using cell cultures and in vivo animal studies. These approaches all converge to the same result, strongly suggesting a causal relationship between EDs and precancerous lesions.

Results:   One hundred twenty-nine patients (pts) (20 at initial diagnosis, 49 with PSA relapse and 60 with PSA persistence after radical prostatectomy) received PSMA PET/CT prior to RT. The majority of pts. (71.3%) had PET-positive findings (55.1% of pts. with PSA recurrence, 75% of pts. with PSA persistence and 100% of newly diagnosed pts). Median PSA before PET/CT in pts. with pathological findings (n = 92) was 1.90 ng/ml and without (n = 37) 0.30 ng/ml. PSA level at time of PET/CT was the only factor associated with PET-positivity.

Regarding the anatomic distribution of lesions, 42.2% and 14.7% of pts. with relapse or persistence had pelvic lymph node and distant metastases. In pts. at initial diagnosis the detection rate of pelvic lymph nodes and distant metastases was 20% and 10%. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT had a high detection rate of PCa recurrence outside the prostatic fossa in pts. being considered for salvage RT (22.4% PET-positive pelvic lymph nodes and 4.1% distant metastases).

We developed for immunoPET a novel recombinant human IgG1 (termed C4) that potently binds an extracellular epitope on human and mouse PD-L1 and radiolabeled the antibody with zirconium-89. Small animal PET/CT studies showed that 89Zr-C4 detected antigen levels on a patient derived xenograft (PDX) established from a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient before an 8-month response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy. Importantly, the concentration of antigen is beneath the detection limit of previously developed anti-PD-L1 radiotracers, including radiolabeled atezolizumab. We also show that 89Zr-C4 can specifically detect antigen in human NSCLC and prostate cancer models endogenously expressing a broad range of PD-L1. 89Zr-C4 detects mouse PD-L1 expression changes in immunocompetent mice, suggesting that endogenous PD-1/2 will not confound human imaging. Lastly, we found that 89Zr-C4 could detect acute changes in tumor expression of PD-L1 due to standard of care chemotherapies.

We identified claims for BDT within a 3-year period of ADT initiation. We then used multivariable regression to examine the association between BDT use and incident osteoporosis, fracture, and use of pharmacological treatment.  Results:   We found that a minority of patients received BDT (n = 2 502, 15%); however, the rate of testing increased to >20% by the end of the study period.

For that reason, the Korean Urological Oncology Society (KUOS) decided to create the Korean Prostate Cancer Database (KPCD).  Materials and methods:   The KPCD program was introduced in 2010. After considering regional distribution, a total of 20 hospitals participated in the KPCD. The Database consists of 4 domains (demographic, pretreatment, treatment, and follow-up data) and 135 variables.  Results:   In total, 7,608 men with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2010 were registered in the KPCD. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 67.6¬±7.7 years. The mean PSA at diagnosis was 74.0¬±366.9 ng/mL, and the proportions of patients with Gleason scores of ‚â§6, 7, and 8-10 were 37.0%, 26.7%, and 34.2%, respectively. At diagnosis, 62.3% of the patients had localized tumors, 14.6% had regional, 12.8% had distant, and 10.4% cases were from unknown diseases. With regards to the initial treatment modality employed, 1.3% of patients were managed with active surveillance, 62.1% underwent surgery, 4.3% underwent radiotherapy, 27.1% had androgen deprivation therapy, and 5.2% underwent unknown therapies.

Materials and methods:   We identified all prostate biopsies performed by a large urology group practice utilizing a centralized pathology lab. We examined total biopsies performed, percentage of positive biopsies, and for those with positive biopsies examined for differences in patient age, PSA, and Gleason score.  Results:   A total of 4,178 biopsies were identified - 2,513 in 2011 and 1,665 in 2014. The percentage of positive biopsies was 27% in 2011 versus 34% in 2014 (p<0.0001). Among patients with positive biopsies, we found statistically significant differences between the 2 cohorts in the median ages and Gleason scores. Patients were about 1 year younger in 2014 compared to 2011 (t-test; p=0.043). High Gleason scores (8-10) were diagnosed in 19% of the 2014 positive biopsies versus 9% in the 2011 positive biopsies (chi square; p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   After the widespread implementation of the 2011 USPTF PSA screening guidelines, 34% fewer biopsies were performed with a 29% increase in positive biopsy rates. We found a significantly higher incidence of high grade disease in 2014 compared with 2011. The percentage of patients with positive biopsies having Gleason scores 8-10 more than doubled in 2014.

Combination of photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) with chemotherapy offers unique advantages over monotherapy alone. However, free drugs, such as photosensitizers and chemotherapeutic agents, lack tumor-targeted accumulation and can be easily eliminated from the body. Moreover, most of the PTT drugs are hydrophobic and their organic solvents have in vivo toxicity, thereby limiting their potential in clinical translation. Herein, simple multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) using IR780 (a near-infrared dye) and docetaxel (DTX)-loaded nanoplatform based on human serum albumin (HSA) (HSA@IR780@DTX) was developed for targeted imaging and for PTT/PDT with chemotherapy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment. In this platform, HSA is a biocompatible nanocarrier that binds to both DTX and IR780. DTX and IR780, as hydrophobic drug, can induce the self-assembly of HSA proteins. Transmission electron microscopic imaging showed that NPs formed by self-assembly are spherical with a smooth surface with a hydrodynamic diameter of 146.5¬±10.8 nm. The cytotoxicity of HSA@IR780@DTX NPs with or without laser irradiation in prostate cancer cells (22RV1) was determined via CCK-8 assay. The antitumor effect of HSA@IR780@DTX plus laser irradiation was better than either HSA@IR780@DTX without laser exposure or single PTT heating induced by HSA@IR780 NPs under near-infrared laser, suggesting a significant combined effect in comparison to monotherapy. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed that HSA@IR780@DTX NPs could preferentially accumulate in tumors. In vivo therapeutic efficacy experiment showed that xenografted prostate tumors on mice treated with HSA@IR780@DTX plus near-infrared laser irradiation were completely inhibited, whereas tumors on mice treated with chemotherapy alone (HSA@DTX and HSA@IR780@DTX without laser) or PTT/PDT alone (HSA@IR780 with laser) showed moderate growth inhibition. Overall, HSA@IR780@DTX NPs showed notable targeting and theranostic potential for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Huibo Lian', 'Jinhui Wu', 'Yiqiao Hu', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Hydrophobic IR780 encapsulated in biodegradable human serum albumin nanoparticles for photothermal and photodynamic therapy.', 'Self-assembled IR780-loaded transferrin nanoparticles as an imaging, targeting and PDT/PTT agent for cancer therapy.', 'Œ±-Lipoic acid stabilized DTX/IR780 micelles for photoacoustic/fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy/chemotherapy of breast cancer.', 'Continuous versus intermittent docetaxel for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nanoparticles and phototherapy combination as therapeutic alternative in prostate cancer: A scoping review.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Emerging photodynamic/sonodynamic therapies for urological cancers: progress and challenges.', 'Development and Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeted Nanosystem Co-Packaging Docetaxel and Androgen Receptor siRNA for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Albumin-based nanoparticles: a promising strategy to overcome cancer drug resistance.', 'Biocompatible Nanomaterials as an Emerging Technology in Reproductive Health; a Focus on the Male.']"""

To date, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying mCRPC are unclear. Given the crucial role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer metastasis, we aimed to analyse the expression and function of Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signal-associated protein named Sox5 in mCRPC.  Methods:   The protein expression levels were analysed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to validate the target of Sox5. The effect of Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 on PCa progression was investigated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Here, we found that TGF-Œ≤-induced EMT was accompanied by increased Sox5 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Sox5 expression attenuated EMT induced by TGF-Œ≤ signalling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Smad3 could bind to the promoter of Sox5 and regulate its expression. Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly, knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal phenotype and cell migration ability. Furthermore, targeting Sox5 could inhibit prostate cancer progression in a xenograft mouse model. In clinic, patients with high Sox5 expression were more likely to suffer from metastases, and high Sox5 expression also has a lower progression-free survival and cancer specific-survival in clinic database.  Conclusions:   Therefore, we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression.""","""['Jieping Hu', 'Jing Tian', 'Shimiao Zhu', 'Libin Sun', 'Jianpeng Yu', 'Hao Tian', 'Qian Dong', 'Qiang Luo', 'Ning Jiang', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Zhiqun Shang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Sox5 induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition by transactivation of Twist1.', 'Periostin Mediates TGF-Œ≤-Induced Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Crosstalk between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and castration resistance mediated by Twist1/AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'Normal and disease-related biological functions of Twist1 and underlying molecular mechanisms.', 'Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'AR-regulated ZIC5 contributes to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'A single-cell based precision medicine approach using glioblastoma patient-specific models.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'Persistent Properties of a Subpopulation of Cancer Cells Overexpressing the Hedgehog Receptor Patched.']"""

A 1988 study linked anaerobes with PC but considered them as opportunists in necrotic tumour. A hypothesis that a ""Helicobacter-like"" process causes PC justified this pilot study. Active surveillance patients were enrolled. Post-prostate massage urine samples were screened using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) technique for bacterial identification after culture in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. 8 out of 18 patients (41%) had either obligate anaerobic (n = 5) or microaerophilic (n = 4, one of whom also had anaerobes) organisms identified. None of 10 control samples contained obligate anaerobes. Although mean PSA was 63% higher in those with low oxygen tolerating bacteria, two high outliers resulted in this difference being non-significant. Given the substantially higher proportion of PC patients with organisms growing in a low concentration of oxygen when combined with previous studies compared to controls, the degree of significance was as high as smoking 5-9 cigarettes a day and needs further investigation.

Methods: Five healthy volunteers were enrolled to validate the safety of 68Ga-RM26 and calculate dosimetry. A total of 28 patients with prostate cancer (17 newly diagnosed and 11 posttherapy) were recruited and provided written informed consent. All the cancer patients underwent PET/CT at 15-30 min after intravenous injection of 1.85 MBq (0.05 mCi) per kilogram of body weight of 68Ga-RM26. Among them, 22 patients (11 newly diagnosed and 11 posttherapy) underwent 68Ga-BBN PET/CT for comparison within 1 wk. 99mTc-MDP (methylene diphosphonate) bone scans were obtained within 2 wk for comparison.

Our objective was to map the recurrence pattern of PCa early biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with serum PSA levels of less than 1 ng/mL, determine how often consensus clinical target volumes (CTVs) based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines cover 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-defined disease, and assess the potential impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on SRT. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of an intention-to-treat population of 270 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at 4 institutions for BCR after prostatectomy without prior radiotherapy at a PSA level of less than 1 ng/mL. RTOG consensus CTVs that included both the prostate bed and the pelvic lymph nodes were contoured on the CT dataset of the PET/CT image by a radiation oncologist masked to the PET component. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images were analyzed by a nuclear medicine physician. 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesions not covered by planning volumes based on the consensus CTVs were considered to have a potential major impact on treatment planning. Results: The median PSA level at the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was 0.48 ng/mL (range, 0.03-1 ng/mL). One hundred thirty-two of 270 patients (49%) had a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT result. Fifty-two of 270 (19%) had at least one PSMA-11-positive lesion not covered by the consensus CTVs. Thirty-three of 270 (12%) had extrapelvic PSMA-11-positive lesions, and 19 of 270 (7%) had PSMA-11-positive lesions within the pelvis but not covered by the consensus CTVs. The 2 most common 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesion locations outside the consensus CTVs were bone (23/52, 44%) and perirectal lymph nodes (16/52, 31%). Conclusion: Post hoc analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT implied a major impact on SRT planning in 52 of 270 patients (19%) with PCa early BCR (PSA < 1.0 ng/mL).

Methods:   EpCAM-positive CTCs were isolated in vivo using the CellCollector from 108 high-risk PCa patients and 36 healthy volunteers. For 27 patients, samples were available before and after treatment. We developed highly sensitive multiplex RT-qPCR assays for 14 genes (KRT19, EpCAM, CDH1, HMBS, PSCA, ALDH1A1, PROM1, HPRT1, TWIST1, VIM, CDH2, B2M, PLS3, and PSA), including epithelial markers, stem cell markers, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers.  Results:   We observed high heterogeneity in gene expression in the captured CTCs for each patient. At least 1 marker was detected in 74 of 105 patients (70.5%), 2 markers in 45 of 105 (40.9%), and 3 markers in 16 of 105 (15.2%). Epithelial markers were detected in 31 of 105 (29.5%) patients, EMT markers in 46 of 105 (43.8%), and stem cell markers in 15 of 105 (14.3%) patients. EMT-marker positivity was very low before therapy (2 of 27, 7.4%), but it increased after therapy (17 of 27, 63.0%), whereas epithelial markers tended to decrease after therapy (2 of 27, 7.4%) compared with before therapy (13 of 27, 48.1%). At least 2 markers were expressed in 40.9% of patients, whereas the positivity was 19.6% for CellSearch, 38.1% for EPISPOT, and 43.8% for CellCollector-based IF-staining.

This issue is of practical significance given resource and time intensive nature of IGRT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PTV margins with predefined and commonly used less-than-daily IGRT schedules using data obtained from patients treated with daily IGRT for prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Daily setup error and 3-dimensional daily alignment data for a total of 108 consecutive patients with prostate cancer treated with 2700 fractions of daily image guidance on tomotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Five IGRT scenarios were simulated: alternate day, twice weekly, once weekly, first 3 days only, and no image guidance. The daily alignment data were modeled to simulate the 5 predefined scenarios by applying appropriate corrections to determine the PTV margin for each image guidance scenario. The data were also analyzed to predict possible geographical miss in any direction using 2 frequently used PTV margins of 7 and 5 mm for all the scenarios.  Results:   Decreasing the frequency of image guidance increased the mean systematic error and the standard deviation of the systematic error. With decreased image guidance frequency, an increase in PTV margins was required to achieve adequate coverage of the clinical target volume. With reduction in image guidance from 50% to 12%, a gradual increase in percentage of fractions with predicted geographical miss using an isotropic PTV margin of 7 or 5 mm was seen. With every 15% decrease in imaging, a 5% increased risk of geographical miss was estimated.

Salvage brachytherapy benefits from the implantation accuracy of brachytherapy procedures using 3D dosimetry and has resulted in more than 50% tumour control rates with long-term. Incontinence rates are always below those of other salvage treatments such as radical prostatectomy, HIFU or cryotherapy. Today, a consensus has been reached to better define good candidates for salvage brachytherapy with respect to disease characteristics at baseline and at failure. No consensus has been clearly defined yet regarding the choice of the technique (low or high dose rate), the total dose to be delivered, or the volume to be implanted (whole gland or focal).

Materials and methods:   We developed a software platform for automatic 3D deformable co-registration of prostate MRI at different time points and applied this method to 10 patients who underwent focal ablative therapy. MRI examinations were performed preoperatively, as well as 1 week and 6 months post treatment. Rigid registration served as reference for assessing co-registration accuracy and precision.  Results:   Segmentation of preoperative and postoperative prostate revealed a significant postoperative volume decrease of the gland that averaged 6.49 cc (P = .017). Applying deformable transformation based on mutual information from 120 pairs of MRI slices, we refined by 2.9 mm (max. 6.25 mm) the alignment of the ablation zone, segmented from contrast-enhanced images on the 1-week postoperative examination, to the 6-month postoperative T2-weighted images. This represented a 500% improvement over the rigid approach (P = .001), corrected by volume. The dissimilarity by Dice index of the mapped ablation zone using deformable transformation vs rigid control was significantly (P = .04) higher at the ablation site than in the whole gland.  Conclusions:   Our findings illustrate our method's ability to correct for deformation at the ablation site. The preliminary analysis suggests that deformable transformation computed from mutual information of preoperative and follow-up MRI is accurate in co-registration of MRI examinations performed before and after focal therapy. The ability to localize the previously ablated tissue in 3D space may improve targeting for image-guided follow-up biopsy within focal therapy protocols.""","""['Cl√©ment Orczyk', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Artem Mikheev', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Myriam Bernaudin', 'Samir S Taneja', 'Samuel Valable', 'Henry Rusinek']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Preliminary experience with a novel method of three-dimensional co-registration of prostate cancer digital histology and in vivo multiparametric MRI.', 'Development of a registration framework to validate MRI with histology for prostate focal therapy.', 'Elastic registration of prostate MR images based on estimation of deformation states.', 'Spatial Tracking of Targeted Prostate Biopsy Locations: Moving Towards Effective Focal Partial Prostate Gland Ablation with Improved Treatment Planning.', 'Prostate cancer: state of the art imaging and focal treatment.', 'Role of MRI for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Salvage treatment for radio-recurrent prostate cancer: a review of literature with focus on recent advancements in image-guided focal salvage therapies.']"""

We hypothesized that promoter methylation could be responsible for PAQR3 silencing in prostate cancer tissues. We aimed to investigate PAQR3 promoter methylation in prostate cancer by comparing it to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 154 human prostate tissue samples, including 92 cases with prostate cancer and 62 cases with BPH, were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Clinicopathological correlation between PAQR3 promoter methylation and prognostically relevant variables was studied by statistical analysis. Promoter methylation of PAQR3 was significantly more frequent in prostate carcinoma compared to BPH (73.9% vs. 25.8%, p<0.01). The high prevalence of PAQR3 methylation in cancer foci was also confirmed with microdissection technique in 12 samples of prostate adenocarcinoma. PAQR3 hypermethylation was associated with perineural invasion (p=0.03), an adverse clinicopathological feature of prostate cancer.

However, it is still debated if EVs contain biologically meaningful amounts of miRNAs and may provide a better source of miRNA biomarkers than whole plasma. The aim of this study was to systematically compare the diagnostic potential of prostate cancer-associated miRNAs in whole plasma and in plasma EVs.  Methods:   RNA was isolated from whole plasma and plasma EV samples from a well characterised cohort of 50 patient with prostate cancer (PC) and 22 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Nine miRNAs known to have a diagnostic potential for PC in cell-free blood were quantified by RT-qPCR and the relative quantities were compared between patients with PC and BPH and between PC patients with Gleason score ‚â• 8 and ‚â§6.  Results:   Only a small fraction of the total cell-free miRNA was recovered from the plasma EVs, however the EV-incorporated and whole plasma cell-free miRNA profiles were clearly different. Four of the miRNAs analysed showed a diagnostic potential in our patient cohort.

Since we and others have shown in rodents and humans that D and DA rapidly and extensively convert to decursinol, here we tested whether decursinol might be an in vivo active compound for suppressing xenograft growth of human prostate cancer cells expressing AR. In SCID-NSG mice carrying subcutaneously inoculated human LNCaP/AR-Luc cells overexpressing the wild type AR, we compared the efficacy of 4.5[Formula: see text]mg decursinol per mouse with equi-molar dose of 6[Formula: see text]mg D/DA per mouse. The result showed that decursinol decreased xenograft tumor growth by 75% and the lung metastasis, whereas D/DA exerted a much less effect. Measurement of plasma decursinol concentration, at 3[Formula: see text]h after the last dose of respective dosing regimen, showed higher circulating level in the decursinol-treated NSG mice than in the D/DA-treated mice. In a subsequent single-dose pharmacokinetic experiment, decursinol dosing led to 3.7-fold area under curve (AUC) of plasma decursinol over that achieved by equi-molar D/DA dosing.

Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzes the reversible isomerization of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in the glycolysis. Proteomics of a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line revealed the presence of the G233D TIM variant, a new allelic type whose biochemical properties have not been reported [1].  Objective:   Provide the first biochemical and biophysical characterization of the allelic variant G233D of TIM.  Methods:   The Michaelis-Menten curves using both substrates of TIM were obtained. Also the effect of the competitive inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was assessed in presence of GAP and DHAP. The thermal stability in absence and presence of PEP was analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. For comparison purposes, all the measurements were carried out on the wild type TIM and variant G233D.  Results:   The G233D variant exhibited a kcat value 4-fold lower than that of the WT enzyme in the GAP isomerization to DHAP, which is the reverse reaction of the glycolytic pathway. The G233D variant exhibited Ki and IC50 values of 120 ŒºM and 356 ŒºM in the presence of several concentrations of GAP and 0.3 mM DHAP, respectively. These inhibition parameters are similar to those exhibited by the WT enzyme. The thermal unfolding cooperativity of G233D variant was significantly increased upon PEP binding, suggesting that the ligand-bound enzyme was trapped in a rigid conformation.  Conclusion:   We suggest that the flow of GAP through glycolysis could be enhanced by the decreased activity of the G233D variant in the formation of DHAP.""","""['Valeria Guzm√°n-Luna', 'Leticia Olvera-Rodr√≠guez', 'Peniel Bustamante-Villalobos', 'Gloria Saab-Rinc√≥n']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Curr Enzym Inhib""","""['Wildtype and engineered monomeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei: partitioning of reaction intermediates in D2O and activation by phosphite dianion.', 'Hydron transfer catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase.

We found that the expression of ATP6V0C was higher in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3M-1E8 and PC-3M with high metastatic potential than that from cell lines PC-3M-2B4 and PC-3 with low metastatic potential, indicating that ATP6V0C enhanced metastatic capacity in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, silencing of ATP6V0C in PC-3M-1E8 cells inhibited V-ATPase activity (by ~5-fold), decreased extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and successively decreased activation of secreted MMP-9 (by ~3.6-fold), which coincided with the inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as a marked decrease in the expression of LASS2/TMSG1 probably through positive feedback. Thus we concluded that silencing of the ATP6V0C gene effectively suppressed the migration and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells through the inhibition of the function of V-ATPase, not through a LASS2/TMSG1-dependent manner. Therefore ATP6V0C inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Pengcheng Zou', 'Yifeng Yang', 'Xiaoyan Xu', 'Beiying Liu', 'Fang Mei', 'Jiangfeng You', 'Qichen Liu', 'Fei Pei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Silencing of vacuolar ATPase c subunit ATP6V0C inhibits invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Silencing of a novel tumor metastasis suppressor gene LASS2/TMSG1 promotes invasion of prostate cancer cell in vitro through increase of vacuolar ATPase activity.', 'LASS2/TMSG1 gene silencing promotes the invasiveness and metastatic of human prostatic carcinoma cells through increase in vacuolar ATPase activity.', 'Regulation of V-ATPase assembly and function of V-ATPases in tumor cell invasiveness.', 'TMSG-1 and its roles in tumor biology.', 'The Potential Role of Exosomal Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'UBE2S as a novel ubiquitinated regulator of p16 and Œ≤-catenin to promote bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'An auto-antibody identified from phenotypic directed screening platform shows host immunity against EV-A71 infection.', 'Cell-free plasma microRNAs that identify patients with glioblastoma.', 'Computational Approaches for Cancer-Fighting: From Gene Expression to Functional Foods.']"""

However, its biological role and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and progression are still unknown. In the present study, we found that PLAC1 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and its expression level was associated with advanced pathological stage and it was also correlated with shorter progression-free survival of lung cancer patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PLAC1 expression by siRNA inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and impaired invasive ability in NSCLC cells partly via regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression. Our findings present that increased PLAC1 could be identified as a negative prognostic biomarker in NSCLC and regulate cell proliferation and invasion.

Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Completeness of prostate cancer data in NCRAS and CAP and agreement for tumour, node, metastases (TNM) stage (T1/T2; T3; T4/N1/M1) and Gleason grade (4-6; 7; 8-10), measured by differences in proportions and Cohen's kappa statistic.

Results:   Compared with CAP, completeness was lower in NCRAS for Gleason grade (41.2% vs 76.7%, difference 35.5, 95% CI 32.1 to 39.0) and TNM stage (29.9% vs 67.6%, difference 37.6, 95% CI 34.1 to 41.1).

Family caregivers have the potential to help patients manage those symptoms, as well as their own stress, if they are equipped with the proper resources. Electronic health (eHealth) systems may be able to provide those resources. Very sick patients may not be able to use such systems themselves to report their symptoms but family caregivers could.  Objective:   The aim of this paper was to assess the effects on cancer patient symptom distress of an eHealth system that alerts clinicians to significant changes in the patient's symptoms, as reported by a family caregiver.  Methods:   A pooled analysis from two randomized clinical trials (NCT00214162 and NCT00365963) compared outcomes at 12 months for two unblinded groups: a control group (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]-Only) that gave caregivers access to CHESS, an online support system, and an experimental group (CHESS+CR [Clinician Report]), which also had CHESS but with a CR that automatically alerted clinicians if symptoms exceeded a predetermined threshold of severity. Participants were dyads (n=235) of patients with advanced lung, breast, or prostate cancer and their respective family caregivers from 5 oncology clinics in the United States of America. The proportion of improved patient threshold symptoms was compared between groups using area-under-the-curve analysis and binomial proportion tests. The proportion of threshold symptoms out of all reported symptoms was also examined.  Results:   When severe caregiver-reported symptoms were shared with clinicians, the symptoms were more likely to be subsequently reported as improved than when the symptoms were not shared with clinicians (P<.001). Fewer symptom reports were completed in the group of caregivers whose reports went to clinicians than in the CHESS-Only group (P<.001), perhaps because caregivers, knowing their reports might be sent to a doctor, feared they might be bothering the clinician.

Methods and materials:   Patients included in this analysis were treated under a Phase II randomized trial that evaluated the role of 19-Gy HDR-BT monotherapy in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers. Multiparametric prostate MRI and prostate biopsy were performed in patients with suspicious local recurrence. The site of local relapse was compared with the initial site of disease. The dose received by the site of recurrence was investigated through registration of the posttreatment multiparametric prostate MRI with the HDR-BT treatment plan.  Results:   Eight of 87 treated patients were found to have local recurrence after 19-Gy HDR-BT. Seven of the eight recurrences were at the site of initial bulk disease. Seven patients were found to have a more aggressive histology in the posttreatment biopsy. The mean volume of prostate that had received 100% of prescription dose was 97%. Mean dose to area of recurrence was 29.1 Gy, whereas dose to 98% and dose to 90% of the recurrence were 21.6 Gy and 23.2 Gy, respectively.  Conclusions:   The relapse pattern after a single 19-Gy HDR-BT is predominantly associated with the site of initial disease. This lends some rationale to future strategies of further focused dose escalation to initial site of disease, notwithstanding the fact that the calculated biologically equivalent dose using linear-quadratic assumptions is already very high.""","""['Lucas C Mendez', 'Ananth Ravi', 'Hans Chung', 'Chia-Lin Tseng', 'Matt Wronski', 'Moti Paudel', 'Merrylee McGuffin', 'Patrick Cheung', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Gerard Morton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Dosimetry of local failure with single dose 19\xa0Gy high-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Results of multiparametric transrectal ultrasound-based focal high-dose-rate dose escalation combined with supplementary external beam irradiation in intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer patients.', 'The effect of catheter displacement and anatomical variations on the dose distribution in MRI-guided focal HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnosis and management of local recurrence after low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Brachytherapy: current status and future strategies -- can high dose rate replace low dose rate and external beam radiotherapy?', 'Efficacy of focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the treatment of patients diagnosed with low or favourable: intermediate-risk prostate cancer-a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.', 'Safety and efficacy associated with single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy in localized prostate cancer: a\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a scoping review on outcomes and toxicities for all disease sites.', 'Feasibility and safety of definite volumetric modulated arc therapy with simultaneous integrated boost to the dominant intraprostatic lesion in patients with unfavorable intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous ThermoBrachytherapy: Electromagnetic Simulation Methods for Fast and Accurate Adaptive Treatment Planning.']"""

A four-kallikrein panel model was originally developed and validated by the Dutch center of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). The kallikrein panel is now commercially available as 4Kscore‚Ñ¢.  Objective:   To assess whether these findings could be replicated among participants in the Finnish section of ERSPC (FinRSPC) and whether Œ≤-microseminoprotein (MSP), a candidate prostate cancer biomarker, adds predictive value.  Design, setting, and participants:   Among 4861 biopsied screening-positive participants in the first three screening rounds of FinRSPC, a case-control subset was selected that included 1632 biopsy-positive cases matched by age at biopsy to biopsy-negative controls.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The predictive accuracy of prespecified prediction models was compared with biopsy outcomes.  Results and limitations:   Among men with PSA of 4.0-25ng/ml, 1111 had prostate cancer, 318 of whom had high-grade disease. Total PSA and age predicted high-grade cancer with an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.614-0.681) and the four-kallikrein panel increased discrimination to 0.746 (95% CI 0.717-0.774). Adding MSP to the four-kallikrein panel led to a significant (Wald test; p=0.015) but small increase (0.003) in discrimination. Limitations include a risk of verification bias among men with PSA of 3.0-3.99ng/ml and the absence of digital rectal examination results.  Conclusions:   These findings provide additional evidence that kallikrein markers can be used to inform biopsy decision-making. Further studies are needed to define the role of MSP.

The effects of Ra223 on CD8+ T cell subsets in patients with prostate cancer is unknown.  Patients and methods:   Fifteen men with metastatic prostate cancer with clinical indication for Ra223 without any autoimmune or immune deficiency conditions were enrolled. Patients received a course of Ra223 50 kBq/kg. Concurrent use of prednisone ‚â§ 10 mg a day was allowed. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and 3 to 4 weeks after the first dose of Ra223 50 kBq/kg. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified and analyzed for the phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry.  Results:   One Ra223 treatment did not result in significant change in the overall frequencies of CD8+ T cells and their subsets including naive, central memory, and effect memory cells. However, the mean frequency of programmed cell death protein 1-expressing EM CD8+ T cells decreased after 1 Ra223 treatment from 20.6% to 14.6% (P = .020), whereas no significant change was observed in the frequencies of CD27-, CD28-, or CTLA4-expressing T cells.

Our aim was to evaluate the contribution of 11C-choline PET/CT in patients with PCa, biochemical relapse and PSA <1 ng/ml.  Material and method:   Fifty consecutive patients (mean age: 65.9¬±5.6 years) with biochemical relapse of PCa and serum PSA <1ng/ml were evaluated retrospectively. PET/CT was performed 20min after intravenous administration of 555-740 MBq of 11C-choline. Minimum follow up time was 30 months.  Results:   Twenty-one out of 50 patients (42%) had an abnormal 11C-choline PET/CT.

Methods:   Using our all-human liver microphysiological system (MPS) platform as a model to closely recapitulate the early metastatic events, we isolated exosomes from both tumor cells and liver microenvironment.  Results:   We observed that while priming of the hepatic niche (HepN) with MDA-231 breast cancer derived exosomes facilitated seeding of the cancer cells in the liver, subsequent tumor outgrowth was diminished; this was consistent with increased entry into dormancy. We found that hepatic niche (HepN) derived exosomes contribute significantly to the exosome pool and are distinguished from cancer derived exosomes based on their size, protein and miRNA content. By Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the miRNA content of the HepN, MDA-231/HepN and MDA-231 cells we showed that the HepN derived exosomes affect the breast cancer cells by suppressing pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation and invasion. More importantly exposure of MDA-231 and MDA-468 cells to purified normal HepN derived exosomes, induced changes in the cells consistent with a Mesenchymal to Epithelial reverting Transition (MErT). miRNA arrays performed on MDA-231 treated with Hum Hep/NPC derived exosomes showed significant changes in the levels of a select number of miRNAs involved in epithelial cell differentiation and miRNAs, such as miR186, miR23a and miR205, from our top and bottom bins have previously been reported to regulate E-cadherin transcription and MErT induction in various cancer types. Consistently HepN derived exosome treatment of breast and prostate cancer lines lead to a transient induction of E-cadherin and ZO-1 at the protein level and a more epithelial-like morphology of the cells.  Conclusions:   Collectively our data revealed a novel mechanism of regulation of the metastatic cascade, showing a well-orchestrated, timely controlled crosstalk between the cancer cells and the HepN and implicating for the first time the normal tissue/HepN derived exosomes in enabling seeding and entry into dormancy of the cancer cells at the metastatic site.""","""['Nikolina Dioufa', 'Amanda M Clark', 'Bo Ma', 'Colin H Beckwitt', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Macrophage phenotypic subtypes diametrically regulate epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-100 shuttled by mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes suppresses in vitro angiogenesis through modulating the mTOR/HIF-1Œ±/VEGF signaling axis in breast cancer cells.', 'Hepatic nonparenchymal cells drive metastatic breast cancer outgrowth and partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'The role of CAF derived exosomal microRNAs in the tumour microenvironment of melanoma.', 'Imaging exosome transfer from breast cancer cells to stroma at metastatic sites in orthotopic nude-mouse models.', 'Forging New Therapeutic Targets: Efforts of Tumor Derived Exosomes to Prepare the Pre-Metastatic Niche for Cancer Cell Dissemination and Dormancy.', 'Critical Review on the Different Roles of Exosomes in TNBC and Exosomal-Mediated Delivery of microRNA/siRNA/lncRNA and Drug Targeting Signalling Pathways in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'The application of exosomes in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Breast Cancer Metastatic Dormancy and Relapse: An Enigma of Microenvironment(s).', 'The roles of small extracellular vesicles as prognostic biomarkers and treatment approaches in triple-negative breast cancer.']"""

Methods:   The cohort included patients with clinically localized PCa. Samples taken from the primary tumor were used to determine PTEN genomic deletions using FISH, and to analyze epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Patients were followed for PCa recurrence on average for 8 years after diagnosis.  Results:   The study included 471 patients with data on PTEN loss, and the frequency of hemi- and homozygous PTEN loss was 10.0% and 4.5%, respectively. Loss of PTEN was associated with a significantly higher risk of recurrence (any vs. no PTEN loss; HR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.03-2.93). Hazard ratios for hemi- and homozygous loss were 1.39 (95% CI: 0.73-2.64) and 2.84 (95% CI: 1.30-6.19), respectively. Epigenome-wide methylation profiling identified 4,208 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR Q-value < 0.01) in tumors with any versus no PTEN loss. There were no genome-wide significant differentially methylated CpGs in homo- versus hemizygous deleted tumors. Tumor methylation data were used to build a methylation signature of PTEN loss in our cohort, which was confirmed in TCGA, and included CpGs in ATP11A, GDNF, JAK1, JAM3, and VAPA.

PLD expression and/or activity is raised in breast, colorectal, gastric, kidney and thyroid carcinomas but its role in prostate cancer (PCa), the major cancer of men in the western world, is unclear.  Methods:   PLD1 protein expression in cultured PNT2C2, PNT1A, P4E6, LNCaP, PC3, PC3M, VCaP, 22RV1 cell lines and patient-derived PCa cells was analysed by western blotting. PLD1 protein localisation in normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissue sections and in a PCa tissue microarray (TMA) was examined by immunohistochemistry. PLD activity in PCa tissue was assayed using an Amplex Red method. The effect of PLD inhibitors on PCa cell viability was measured using MTS and colony forming assays.  Results:   PLD1 protein expression was low in the luminal prostate cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, 22RV1) compared with basal lines (PC3 and PC3M). PLD1 protein expression was elevated in BPH biopsy tissue relative to normal and PCa samples. In normal and BPH tissue, PLD1 was predominantly detected in basal cells as well in some stromal cells, rather than in luminal cells. In PCa tissue, luminal cells expressed PLD1. In a PCa TMA, the mean peroxidase intensity per DAB-stained Gleason 6 and 7 tissue section was significantly higher than in sections graded Gleason 9. In CRPC tissue, PLD1 was expressed prominently in the stromal compartment, in luminal cells in occasional glands and in an expanding population of cells that co-expressed chromogranin A and neurone-specific enolase. Levels of PLD activity in normal and PCa tissue samples were similar. A specific PLD1 inhibitor markedly reduced the survival of both prostate cell lines and patient-derived PCa cells compared with two dual PLD1/PLD2 inhibitors. Short-term exposure of PCa cells to the same specific PLD1 inhibitor significantly reduced colony formation.  Conclusions:   A new specific inhibitor of PLD1, which is well tolerated in mice, reduces PCa cell survival and thus has potential as a novel therapeutic agent to reduce prostate cancer progression. Increased PLD1 expression may contribute to the hyperplasia characteristic of BPH and in the progression of castrate-resistant PCa, where an expanding population of neuroendocrine-like cells express PLD1.""","""['Amanda R Noble', 'Norman J Maitland', 'Daniel M Berney', 'Martin G Rumsby']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Phospholipase D2 in prostate cancer: protein expression changes with Gleason score.', 'Phorbol ester stimulates ethanolamine release from the metastatic basal prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not from prostate epithelial cell lines LNCaP and P4E6.', 'Increased phospholipase D activity contributes to tumorigenesis in prostate cancer cell models.', 'Structural Insights for Drugs Developed for Phospholipase D Enzymes.', 'Expression of phospholipase D isoforms in mammalian cells.', 'Multi-omics profiling of PC-3 cells reveals bufadienolides-induced lipid metabolic remodeling by regulating long-chain lipids synthesis and hydrolysis.', 'Phospholipase D1 promotes cervical cancer progression by activating the RAS pathway.', 'PDZRN4 suppresses tumorigenesis and androgen therapy-resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Upregulated phospholipase D2 expression and activity is related to the metastatic properties of melanoma.', 'Phosphatidylcholine-Derived Lipid Mediators: The Crosstalk Between Cancer Cells and Immune Cells.']"""

These findings call into question the traditional view of radiation response: cells cannot be envisioned as isolated units. Here, we investigated traditional colony formation assays to determine if they also comprise cellular communication affecting the radiation response, using colony formation assays with varying numbers of cells, modulated beam irradiation and media transfer. Our findings showed that surviving fraction gradually increased with increasing number of irradiated cells. Specifically, for DU-145 human prostate cancer cells, surviving fraction increased 1.9-to-4.1-fold after 5-12 Gy irradiation; and for MM576 human melanoma cells, surviving fraction increased 1.9-fold after 5 Gy irradiation. Furthermore, increased surviving fraction was evident after modulated beam irradiation, where irradiated cells could communicate with nonirradiated cells. Media from dense cell culture also increased surviving fraction. The results suggest that traditional colony formation assays comprise unavoidable cellular communication affecting radiation outcome and the shape of the survival curve.

Our previously published model for Tomotherapy treatment plan verification (AirQA) has been enhanced to take into account patient and couch transmission. AirQA estimates the OBD signal during irradiation with nothing in the beam path from the leaf control sinogram, allowing us to check whether the planned treatment is correctly delivered by the machine. TransitQA allows us to check the treatment delivery with the patient on the couch, potentially showing the effects of changes in the patient anatomy and delivery errors.  Methods:   Patient and couch transmission have been added to the model using the OBD projections of pretreatment megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT). The difference in the energy spectra between the imaging and treatment beams has been corrected by an exponent from the MVCT projections consisting of the ratio of the mass attenuation coefficients. This exponent has been found to not vary significantly with the atomic number Z, allowing us to apply this procedure to heterogeneous media, such as patients. The attenuated OBD projections acquired during the treatment are compared to the model via a signed global Œ≥-index analysis. The dose criterion was 5% of the 95th percentile of the dose distribution, and the distance to agreement (DTA) was 4 mm.  Results:   Our method has been applied to a heterogeneous phantom with 98.1% of the points passing the Œ≥-evaluation test, showing that the model can predict the attenuated OBD projection. The method has been applied to two representative patients throughout the whole treatment, highlighting variations in the signal transmission and Œ≥-index.  Conclusion:   This paper establishes the proof-of-concept of transit dosimetry for all patients treated by Tomotherapy. Moreover, this method can be used as a surrogate for in vivo dosimetry.""","""['Olivier Pisaturo', 'Fr√©d√©ric Mi√©ville', 'Pierre-Alain Tercier', 'Abdelkarim Said Allal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Independent calculation of dose distributions for helical tomotherapy using a conventional treatment planning system.', 'Quasi real time in vivo dosimetry for VMAT.', 'Clinical implementation of Dosimetry Check‚Ñ¢ for TomoTherapy¬Æ delivery quality assurance.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'Development of Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI)-Dedicated Shielding and Image-Guided System and Dose Evaluation Using 3D-Printed Rat Phantom.']"""

Purpose/hypothesis:   To investigate changes in quantitative T2 parameters in lesions and noncancerous tissue of men on active surveillance for prostate cancer taking dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo daily for 6 months.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population/subjects:   Forty men randomized to 6 months of daily dutasteride (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20).  Field strength/sequence:   Multiparametric 3T MRI at baseline and 6 months. This included a multiecho MR sequence for quantification of the T2 relaxation times, in three regions of interest (index lesion, noncancerous peripheral [PZ] and transitional [TZ] zones). A synthetic signal contrast (T2 Q contrast) between lesion and noncancerous tissue was assessed using quantitative T2 values.

Statistical tests:   Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U-tests, Spearman's correlation.  Results:   When compared to noncancerous tissue, shorter T2 values were observed within lesions at baseline (83.5 and 80.5 msec) and 6 months (81.5 and 81.9 msec) in the placebo and dutasteride arm, respectively.

The current standard of care for high-risk localized PCa is a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiation (XRT). The majority of these patients however become resistant due to incomplete responses to ADT as a result of selective cells maintaining androgen receptor (AR) activity. Improvement can be made if increasing radiosensitivity is realized. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the next-generation PCa drug Enzalutamide (ENZA), as a radiosensitizer in XRT therapy.  Methods:   Using a number of androgen-dependent (LNCaP, PC3-T877A) and androgen-independent (C4-2, 22RV1, PC3, PC3-AR V7) cell lines, the effect of ENZA as a radiosensitizer was studied alone or in combination with ADT and/or XRT. Cell viability and cell survival were assessed, along with determination of cell cycle arrest, DNA damage response and repair, apoptosis and senescence.  Results:   Our results indicated that either ENZA alone (in AR positive, androgen-dependent PCa cells) or in combination with ADT (in AR positive, hormone-insensitive PCa cells) potentiates radiation response [Dose enhancement factor (DEF) of 1.75 in LNCAP and 1.35 in C4-2] stronger than ADT + XRT conditions. Additionally, ENZA sensitized androgen dependent PCa cells to XRT in a schedule-dependent manner, where concurrent administration of ENZA and radiation lead to a maximal radiosensitization when compared to either drug administration prior or after XRT. In LNCaP cells, ENZA treatment significantly prolonged the presence of XRT-induced phospho-Œ≥H2AX up to 24 h after treatment; suggesting enhanced DNA damage. It also significantly increased XRT-induced apoptosis and senescence.  Conclusions:   Our data indicates that ENZA acts as a much stronger radiosensitizer compared to ADT. We have also observed that its efficacy is schedule dependent and related to increased levels of DNA damage and a delay of DNA repair processes. Finally, the initial abrogation of DNA-PKcs activity by AR inhibition and its subsequent recovery might represent an important mechanism by which PCa cells acquire resistance to combined anti-androgen and XRT treatment. This work suggests a new use of ENZA in combination with XRT that could be applicable in clinical trial settings for patients with early and intermediate hormone responsive disease.""","""['Maryam Ghashghaei', 'Tamim M Niazi', 'Mitra Heravi', 'Hamed Bekerat', 'Mark Trifiro', 'Miltiadis Paliouras', 'Thierry Muanza']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Corrigendum.', 'Identification of a Radiosensitivity Molecular Signature Induced by Enzalutamide in Hormone-sensitive and Hormone-resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Establishment of enzalutamide-resistant human prostate cancer cell lines and screening of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles.', 'Radiosensitization by enzalutamide for human prostate cancer is mediated through the DNA damage repair pathway.', 'ADT with antiandrogens in prostate cancer induces adverse effect of increasing resistance, neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor metastasis.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'JNJ-64619178 radiosensitizes and suppresses fractionated ionizing radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy of Radium-223 and Enzalutamide in the Intratibial LNCaP Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Mitochondrial metabolism: a predictive biomarker of radiotherapy efficacy and toxicity.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Phase II Randomized Study of Salvage Radiation Therapy Plus Enzalutamide or Placebo for High-Risk Prostate-Specific Antigen Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: The SALV-ENZA Trial.']"""

Macrophages are actively engaged in phagocytosing epithelial cell corpses. However, it is unknown whether microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is involved and contribute to prevent inflammation.  Methods:   Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to characterize the macrophage subpopulation residing in the epithelial layer of the rat ventral prostate (VP) after castration. Stereology was employed to determine variations in the number of ED1 and ED2. Mice were treated with either chloroquine or L-asparagine to block autophagy.  Results:   M1 (iNOS-positive) and M2 macrophages (MRC1+ and ARG1+) were not found in the epithelium at day 5 after castration. The percentage of CD68+ (ED1) and CD163+ (ED2) phenotypes increased after castration but only CD68+ cells were present in the epithelium. RT-PCR showed increased content of the autophagy markers Bcl1 and LC3 after castration. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed the presence of LC3+ and ATG5+ cells in the epithelium. Double immunohistochemistry showed these cells to be CD68+ /LC3+ , compatible with the LAP phenotype. LC3+ cells accumulate significantly after castration. Chloroquine and L-asparagine administration caused inflammation of the glands at day 5 after castration.  Conclusions:   CD68+ macrophages phagocytose apoptotic cell corpses and activate the LAP pathway, thereby contributing to the preservation of a non-inflammed microenvironment. Marked inflammation was detected when autophagy blockers were administered to castrated animals.""","""['Juliete A F Silva', 'Alexandre Bruni-Cardoso', 'Taize M Augusto', 'Danilo M Damas-Souza', 'Guilherme O Barbosa', 'S√©rgio L Felisbino', 'Dagmar R Stach-Machado', 'Hernandes F Carvalho']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Rapid reduction in blood flow to the rat ventral prostate gland after castration: preliminary evidence that androgens influence prostate size by regulating blood flow to the prostate gland and prostatic endothelial cell survival.', 'Biomarker analysis demonstrates a hypoxic environment in the castrated rat ventral prostate gland.', 'Castration-induced prostate epithelial cell apoptosis results from targeted oxidative stress attack of M1142 -macrophages.', 'LC3-Associated Phagocytosis and Inflammation.', 'The clearance of dying cells: table for two.', 'Clinical Effect of Fuzheng Guben Decoction in the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer and Its Influence on Immune Function under Continuous Nursing Intervention.', 'Absence of nuclear receptors LXRs impairs immune response to androgen deprivation and leads to prostate neoplasia.', 'Cotinine inhibits TLR4/NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway and improves deep vein thrombosis in rats.', 'Transcriptional regulators and regulatory pathways involved in prostate gland adaptation to a hypoandrogen environment.', 'Inflammation and NF-Œ∫B Signaling in Prostate Cancer: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.']"""

Here, we report a compound prostate cancer murine model in which these signalling pathways cooperate to produce a more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype. Using Cre-LoxP technology and the probasin promoter, we combined the loss of Pten (Ptenfl/fl ), to activate the PI3K signalling pathway, with either dominant stabilized Œ≤-catenin [Catnb+/lox(ex3) ] or activated K-RAS (K-Ras+/V12 ) to aberrantly activate WNT and MAPK signalling, respectively. Synchronous activation of all three pathways (triple mutants) significantly reduced survival (median 96 days) as compared with double mutants [median: 140 days for Catnb+/lox(ex3) Ptenfl/fl ; 182 days for Catnb+/lox(ex3) K-Ras+/V12 ; 238 days for Ptenfl/fl K-Ras+/V12 ], and single mutants [median: 383 days for Catnb+/lox(ex3) ; 407 days for Ptenfl/fl ], reflecting the accelerated tumourigenesis. Tumours followed a stepwise progression from mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma, similar to that seen in human disease. There was significantly elevated cellular proliferation, tumour growth and percentage of invasive adenocarcinoma in triple mutants as compared with double mutants and single mutants. Triple mutants showed not only activated AKT, extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2, and nuclear Œ≤-catenin, but also significantly elevated signalling through mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In summary, we show that combined deregulation of the PI3K, MAPK and WNT signalling pathways drives rapid progression of prostate tumourigenesis, and that deregulation of all three pathways results in tumours showing aberrant mTORC1 signalling. As mTORC1 signalling is emerging as a key driver of androgen deprivation therapy resistance, our findings are important for understanding the biology of therapy-resistant prostate cancer and identifying potential approaches to overcome this.

Methods:   In all, 39 patients with biochemical recurrence after RP who had no primary indication for adjuvant RT due to the absence of biologically unfavorable disease (e.g., extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive margins, or lymph node involvement) underwent a 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT for planning of sRT.  Results:   PET/CT was positive in 84.6% (33/39) of patients. A total of 61 lesions were observed in these patients (on average 1.8 lesions per patient); 30.3% (10/33) of patients had locally recurrent disease in the prostatic bed. The clinical TNM stage (TNM: tumour-lymph nodes-metastasis-classification) was altered in 69.7% (23/33) of patients following PET, resulting in individualized treatment concepts. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >1.0 ng/mL was significantly associated with an increased risk of extrapelvic metastatic disease (p = 0.048). The PSA level at the time of PSMA ligand PET/CT correlated with the peak standardized uptake value (SUVpeak; p = 0.002). According to current clinical guidelines, the remaining 15.4% (6/39) of patients without evidence of disease on PET received sRT with a dose of 66.0 Gy.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that in patients with biochemical recurrence who did not receive early sRT, a 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT for restaging of disease allows for tailoring and individualizing treatment.

These derivaties demonstrated a moderate to strong anti-proliferative activities against human cell lines HEL and K562 (Leukemia), prostate (PC3), breast (MDA-MB-231) and melanoma (WM9). Compound 4g showed strongest cytotoxic effect against PC3 cells with IC50 value of 0.64 ŒºM, which was 12-fold, 31-fold and 26-fold lower than the parental tetrandrine, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively. Preliminary structure-activity relationship study indicated that urea subsititution was the key pharmacophore for the enhancement of their antitumor activities. Induction of apoprosis by 4g was associated with the activation of pro-apoptotic protein BAX and inhibition of antiapoptosis proteins survivin as well as Bcl-2. Moreover, activation of caspases led to increase cleavage of PARP, which further accelerates apoptotic cell death. These results reveal that the compound 4g may be used as a potential anticancer drug candidate.""","""['Junjie Lan', 'Lan Huang', 'Huayong Lou', 'Chao Chen', 'Tangjingjun Liu', 'Shengcao Hu', 'Yao Yao', 'Junrong Song', 'Jun Luo', 'Yazhou Liu', 'Bin Xia', 'Lei Xia', 'Xueyi Zeng', 'Yaacov Ben-David', 'Weidong Pan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Design, Synthesis of Novel Tetrandrine-14-l-Amino Acid and Tetrandrine-14-l-Amino Acid-Urea Derivatives as Potential Anti-Cancer Agents.', 'Design and synthesis of novel tetrandrine derivatives as potential anti-tumor agents against human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Design, synthesis and biological activities of tetrandrine and fangchinoline derivatives as antitumer agents.', 'Tetrandrine, a Chinese plant-derived alkaloid, is a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy.', 'Tetrandrine--A molecule of wide bioactivity.', 'A novel class of C14-sulfonate-tetrandrine derivatives as potential chemotherapeutic agents for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Progress on structural modification of Tetrandrine with wide range of pharmacological activities.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of N14-Amino Acid-Substituted Tetrandrine Derivatives as Potential Antitumor Agents against Human Colorectal Cancer.', 'Natural Small Molecules in Breast Cancer Treatment: Understandings from a Therapeutic Viewpoint.', 'High Concentration of Iopromide Induces Apoptosis and Autophagy in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells via Activating a ROS-dependent Cellular Stress Pathway.']"""

Material and methods:   Between June 2006 and January 2016, 409 men received post prostatectomy intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) with protocolised planning. 310 patients received radiation treatment (RT) to the Prostate Fossa (PF) alone and 99 patients received RT to PF and pelvic lymphatics (PF + LN) usually in combination with androgen deprivation (AD) therapy. Any failure not detected on conventional imaging was delineated with PSMA-PET scanning. Sites of failure were characterised as in-field (PF ¬± LN), or out of field (nodal alone, distant metastatic alone (visceral or bone) or multi-site failure). Nodal failure was further divided into pelvic failure and/or distant failure.  Results:   119 men developed BF, defined as a PSA rise of >0.2 or greater, above post-RT nadir. Freedom from BF was 71% in the PF group and 70% in the PF + LN group, with median follow up of 52 and 44 months respectively. AD was used concomitantly in 13% of the PF group and 92% of the PF + LN group. 81 patients with BF (68%) had PSMA-PET imaging performed as per study intent, 67 (80%) of whom had PSMA avid disease identified. PSMA-PET delineated in-field failure occurred in 2/50 (4%) of the PF group and 1/17 (6%) in the PF + LN group. Nodal failure alone was 33/50 (66%) for the PF group vs 7/17 (41%) for the PF + LN group. For the nodal only failure patients, 18/33 (55%) had pelvic-only nodal failure in the PF group compared to 1/7 (14%) in the PF + LN group (p = 0.03). 16 (32%) of the PSMA avid failures in the PF group would have been encompassed by standard pelvic lymphatic radiotherapy volumes.  Conclusion:   Post-prostatectomy radiation treatment resulted in excellent in-field control rates. Isolated pelvic nodal failure was rare in those receiving radiotherapy to the prostatic fossa and pelvic nodes but accounted for one third of failures in those receiving PF alone treatment.""","""['Keelan Byrne', 'Thomas Eade', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Linxin Guo', 'Ed Hsiao', 'Geoff Schembri', 'Carolyn Kwong', 'Julia Hunter', 'Louise Emmett', 'George Hruby']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Treatment Outcomes from 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT-Informed Salvage Radiation Treatment in Men with Rising PSA After Radical Prostatectomy: Prognostic Value of a Negative PSMA PET.', 'Prospective, Multisite, International Comparison of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, Multiparametric MRI, and 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT in Men with High-Risk Features and Biochemical Failure After Radical Prostatectomy: Clinical Performance and Patient Outcomes.', 'Patterns of failure after radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer - implications for radiation therapy planning after 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Mapping of Recurrence Sites Following Adjuvant or Salvage Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Drug Intensification in Future Postoperative Radiotherapy Practice in Biochemically-Relapsing Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Pattern of failure in prostate cancer previously treated with radical prostatectomy and post-operative radiotherapy: a secondary analysis of two prospective studies using novel molecular imaging techniques.', 'Intra-fraction displacement of the prostate bed during post-prostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Metaanalysis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Accuracy for the Detection of Prostate Cancer Validated by Histopathology.']"""

Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary outcome variable, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify predictors for PFS. The baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the 2 groups. Median follow-up time was 41 months (range 24-56) and 37 months (range 19-53) in ADT alone group and cryosurgery groups, respectively. Patients receiving cryosurgery had significantly longer PFS (35 vs 25 months, P = 0.0027) and time to castration resistance (36 vs 25 months, P = 0.0011). Cox multivariate analysis associated longer PFS with the following factors: cryosurgery (HR0.207, 95% CI 0.094-0.456), lower prostate specific antigen at diagnosis (‚â§100 ng/ml, HR0.235, 95% CI 0.072-0.763) and lower Gleason score (‚â§7, HR0.195, 95% CI 0.077-0.496).

We evaluated occupation in relation to early- and later-onset prostate cancer in a large pooled study.  Methods:   We used occupational information from census data in five Nordic countries from 1960 to 1990. We identified prostate cancer cases diagnosed from 1961 to 2005 by linkage of census information to national cancer registries and calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) separately for men aged 30-49 and those aged 50 or older. We also conducted separate analyses by period of follow-up, 1961-1985 and 1986-2005, corresponding to pre- and post-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.  Results:   For early-onset prostate cancer (n = 1521), we observed the highest SIRs for public safety workers (e.g. firefighters) (SIR = 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-2.31) and military personnel (SIR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.31-2.85). These SIRs were significantly higher than the SIRs for later-onset disease (for public safety workers, SIR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.14 and for military personnel, SIR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13; pheterogeneity = 0.005 and 0.002, respectively). Administrators and technical workers also demonstrated significantly increased risks for early-onset prostate cancer, but the SIRs did not differ from those of later-onset disease (pheterogeneity >0.05). While our early-onset finding for public safety workers was restricted to the post-PSA period, that for military personnel was restricted to the pre-PSA period.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that occupational exposures, particularly for military personnel, may be associated with early-onset prostate cancer.

This work investigated the influence of additional variables contributing to variations in the assumed linear DVH-OVH correlation for the bladder and rectum in VMAT plans of prostate patients, with the goal of increasing prediction accuracy and achievability of knowledge-based planning methods. VMAT plans were retrospectively generated for 124 prostate patients using multi-criteria optimization. DVHs quantified patient dosimetric data while OVHs quantified patient anatomical information. The DVH-OVH correlations were calculated for fractional bladder and rectum volumes of 30, 50, 65, and 80%. Correlations between potential influencing factors and dose were quantified using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (R). Factors analyzed included the derivative of the OVH, prescribed dose, PTV volume, bladder volume, rectum volume, and in-field OAR volume. Out of the selected factors, only the in-field bladder volume (mean R = 0.86) showed a strong correlation with bladder doses. Similarly, only the in-field rectal volume (mean R = 0.76) showed a strong correlation with rectal doses. Therefore, an OVH formalism accounting for in-field OAR volumes was developed to determine the extent to which it improved the DVH-OVH correlation. Including the in-field factor improved the DVH-OVH correlation, with the mean R values over the fractional volumes studied improving from -0.79 to -0.85 and -0.82 to -0.86 for the bladder and rectum, respectively. A re-planning study was performed on 31 randomly selected database patients to verify the increased accuracy of KBP dose predictions by accounting for bladder and rectum volume within treatment fields. The in-field OVH led to significantly more precise and fewer unachievable KBP predictions, especially for lower bladder and rectum dose-volumes.""","""['Phillip D H Wall', 'Robert L Carver', 'Jonas D Fontenot']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['An overlap-volume-histogram based method for rectal dose prediction and automated treatment planning in the external beam prostate radiotherapy following hydrogel injection.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4œÄ radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Dosimetric impact of organ at risk daily variation during prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'New technologies for the radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

Results:   Overall differences in the odds ratios for later stage prostate, breast and colorectal cancer diagnosis in farm men and women compared with rural non-farm and urban counterparts were not statistically significant, although farm men had twice the odds of either group of being diagnosed at later stage colorectal cancer. The odds of later stage prostate cancer for farm and urban men were similar, but rural non-farm men were significantly less likely than urban men to be diagnosed at later stage. Higher household income was associated with later stage breast and prostate cancer; and private health insurance with extras was negatively associated with later stage prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Differences in stage of cancer diagnosis, particularly between farm and rural non-farm men, remain unexplained but were not statistically significant.

Method:   We denervated rodent prostates chemically and physically, before orthotopically implanting cancer cells. We also performed a human neoadjuvant clinical trial using botulinum toxin type A (Botox) and saline in the same patient, before prostatectomy.  Result:   Bilateral denervation resulted in reduced tumor incidence and size in mice. Botox treatment in humans resulted in increased apoptosis of cancer cells in the Botox treated side. A similar denervation gene array profile was identified in tumors arising in denervated rodent prostates, in spinal cord injury patients and in the Botox treated side of patients. Denervation induced exhibited a signature gene profile, indicating translation and bioenergetic shutdown. Nerves also regulate basic cellular functions of non-neoplastic epithelial cells.  Conclusion:   Nerves play a role in the homeostasis of normal epithelial tissues and are involved in prostate cancer tumor survival. This study confirms that interactions between human cancer and nerves are essential to disease progression.

Often, clinical trials compare therapies that have different types, and severities, of adverse effects. Whether rated by clinicians or patients themselves, it can be difficult to know which side effect profile is more disruptive or bothersome to patients. A simple summary index of bother can help to adjudicate the variability in adverse effects across treatments being compared with each other.  Methods:   Across 4 studies, a total of 5765 patients enrolled in cooperative group studies and industry-sponsored clinical trials were the subjects of the current study. Patients were diagnosed with a range of primary cancer sites, including bladder, brain, breast, colon/rectum, head/neck, hepatobiliary, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, and prostate as well as leukemia and lymphoma. All patients were administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General version (FACT-G). The single item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" (GP5), rated on a 5-point Likert scale, is part of the FACT-G. To determine its validity as a useful summary measure from the patient perspective, it was correlated with individual and aggregated clinician-rated adverse events and patient reports of their general ability to enjoy life.  Results:   Analyses of pharmaceutical trials demonstrated that mean GP5 scores (""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"") significantly differed by maximum adverse event grade (P<.001) in all trials, with a clear trend toward increasing GP5 scores with level of increasing adverse event grade. Effect sizes ranged from 0.13 to 0.46. Analyses of cooperative group trials demonstrated a significant correlation between GP5 and item GF3 (""I am able to enjoy life"") in the predicted direction.  Conclusions:   The single FACT-G item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" is significantly associated with clinician-reported adverse events and with patients' ability to enjoy their lives. It has promise as an overall summary measure of the burden of a given set of treatment toxicities compared with another.

The optimal biopsy frequency during follow-up has not been determined. The goal of this investigation was to use longitudinal AS biopsy data to assess whether the frequency of biopsy could be reduced without substantially prolonging the time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score ‚â• 7.  Methods:   With data from 1375 men with low-risk prostate cancer enrolled in AS at Johns Hopkins, a hidden Markov model was developed to estimate the probability of undersampling at diagnosis, the annual probability of grade progression, and the 10-year cumulative probability of reclassification or progression to Gleason score ‚â• 7. It simulated 1024 potential AS biopsy strategies for the 10 years after diagnosis. For each of these strategies, the model predicted the mean delay in the detection of disease with a Gleason score ‚â• 7.  Results:   The model estimated the 10-year cumulative probability of reclassification from a Gleason score of 6 to a Gleason score ‚â• 7 to be 40.0%. The probability of undersampling at diagnosis was 9.8%, and the annual progression probability for men with a Gleason score of 6 was 4.0%. On the basis of these estimates, a simulation of an annual biopsy strategy estimated the mean time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score ‚â• 7 to be 14.1 months; however, several strategies eliminated biopsies with only small delays (<12 months) in detecting grade progression.  Conclusions:   Although annual biopsy for low-risk men on AS is associated with the shortest time to the detection of disease with a Gleason score ‚â• 7, several alternative strategies may allow less frequent biopsying without sizable delays in detecting grade progression.

To investigate the expression of miR-96 and related target genes in the regulation of prostatic cancer, we compared the expression of miR-96 in both prostatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues, and explored the role of miR-96 in prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   PC-3 cell line originated from human prostatic cancer tissues was prepared. RNA was extracted for examination of miR-96 expression. The expressional alternation of miR-96 target genes, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), in prostatic cancer, was confirmed by PC-3 cells transfected with miR-96 and anti miR-96.  Results:   Compared with control group, levels of FOXO1 and FOXO3a in PC-3 cells treated with anti miR-96 were 1.584 times and 1.637 times higher, respectively. Further, PC-3 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting FOXO1 and FOXO3a, resulting in a significant decrease of FOXO1 and FOXO3a expression, as verified by qPCR and Western blot analyses. Compared with untreated groups, proliferation and cell clonal formation exhibited a marked increase in PC-3 cells under transfection with both siR-FOXO1 and siR-FOXO3a.

We present data from a multi-institutional analysis examining the effect of prior radiation for prostate cancer on device survival.  Materials and methods:   A database was compiled of patients with artificial urinary sphincter cuff erosion, which included demographic and comorbid patient characteristics, functional analyses and interventions. We identified 80 patients with iatrogenic or idiopathic artificial urinary sphincter erosion. Idiopathic erosion cases were further analyzed to determine factors influencing device survival with specific stratification for radiation therapy.  Results:   A total of 56 patients were identified with idiopathic artificial urinary sphincter erosion. Of those men 33 (58.9%) had not undergone radiation treatment while 23 (41.1%) had a history of brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy. In patients without radiation erosion-free median device survival was 3.15 years (95% CI 1.95-5.80), in contrast to the median device survival of only 1.00 year (95% CI 0.36-3.00) in irradiated patients. The erosion-free survival experience of patients with vs without radiation differed significantly (Wilcoxon-Breslow test for equality of survivor functions p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Radiation therapy in patients with known idiopathic cuff erosion in this contemporary analysis correlated with significantly increased time to erosion. Mean time to idiopathic cuff erosion was accelerated by approximately 2 years in irradiated cases.

This study presents estimates of prostate cancer incidence, mortality and burden from 1990 to 2015 by patient age, country and developmental status using the results of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study.  Materials and methods:   Data from vital registration systems and cancer registries were used to generate mortality estimates. Cause specific mortality served as the basis for estimating incidence, prevalence and disability adjusted life years. The global number of incident cases, deaths and disability adjusted life years attributable to prostate cancer are reported as well as age standardized rates.  Results:   Incident cases of prostate cancer increased 3.7-fold from 1990 to 2015. The age standardized incidence rate also increased 1.7-fold during the study period and in 2015 it reached 56.71/100,000 person-years (95% uncertainty interval 45.86-78.45). Global estimates of the age standardized death rate decreased slightly to 14.24 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 11.8-17.95) per 100,000 person-years in 2015. The decline in the age standardized death rate was more prominent in high income countries. Disability adjusted life years attributable to prostate cancer increased by 90% during the study period.  Conclusions:   The prostate cancer mortality rate is decreasing in high income countries. However, the incidence and burden of disease are steadily increasing globally, resulting in further challenges in the allocation of limited health care resources.

Objective:   To examine if this phenomenon still applies when preoperative Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) scores are compared to postoperative scores (CAPRA-S) in RP patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated 10 290 PCa patients who underwent RP at tertiary care centers in Hamburg (Germany) and Milan (Italy) during 1991-2011.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All patients were classified as CAPRA/CAPRA-S LR, IR, or HR (‚â§2, 3-5, and ‚â•6 points, respectively). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastatic disease (metD).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 59.6%, 29.3%, and 11.1% patients were CAPRA-S LR, IR, and HR respectively. For CAPRA-S LR patients, 5-yr BCR-free and metD-free rates for preoperative CAPRA LR versus IR/HR patients were 93.1% versus 85.7% (p<0.001) and 99.7% versus 98.9% (p=0.017), respectively. For CAPRA-S IR/HR patients, the corresponding rates were 69.9% versus 57.2% and 98.2 versus 93.7% (both p<0.001). On multivariable Cox regression analyses, a combination of CAPRA-S and preoperative CAPRA resulted in increases in predictive accuracy for BCR (from 76.0% to 78.3%) and metD (from 82.0% to 84.0%). Specifically, biopsy Gleason patterns and the percentage of positive cores added information to the CAPRA-S score. Long-term follow-up is needed to discern clinical metD differences between preoperative CAPRA risk groups.  Conclusions:   CAPRA-S LR patients in the CAPRA IR/HR group had higher BCR/metD risk. Conversely, CAPRA-S IR/HR patients in the CAPRA LR group had lower BCR/metD risk. Future tools should incorporate better tumor and Gleason quantification to optimize prediction.

Proteins extracted from surgically resected PCA tissues and adjacent tissues of 3 patients were analyzed by label-free quantitative proteomics. The target protein was confirmed by bioinformatics and GEO dataset analyses. To investigate the role of the target protein in PCA, we used lentivirus-mediated small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown protein expression in the prostate carcinoma cell line, CWR22RV1 cells and assessed gene and protein expression by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. CCK8 and colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Cell cycle distributions and apoptosis were assayed by flow cytometry. We selected the differentiation-related protein COPB2 as our target protein based on the results of label-free quantitative proteomics. High expression of COPB2 was found in PCA tissue and was related to poor overall survival based on a public dataset. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in COPB2-knockdown CWR22RV1 cells, as demonstrated by CCK8 and colony formation assays. Additionally, the apoptosis rate and percentage of cells in the G1 phase were increased in COPB2-knockdown cells compared with those in control cells. CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 were downregulated, whereas p21 Waf1/Cip1 and p27 Kip1 were upregulated, affecting the cell cycle signaling pathway.

We previously reported the development of a molecularly bottom-up approach to plasma and serum (P/S) glycomics based on glycan linkage analysis that captures features such as Œ±2-6 sialylation, Œ≤1-6 branching, and core fucosylation as single analytical signals. Based on the behavior of P/S glycans established to date, we hypothesized that the alteration of P/S glycans observed in cancer would be independent of the tissue in which the tumor originated yet exhibit stage dependence that varied little between cancers classified on the basis of tumor origin. Herein, the diagnostic utility of this bottom-up approach as applied to lung cancer patients (n = 127 stage I; n = 20 stage II; n = 81 stage III; and n = 90 stage IV) as well as prostate (n = 40 stage II), serous ovarian (n = 59 stage III), and pancreatic cancer patients (n = 15 rapid autopsy) compared to certifiably healthy individuals (n = 30), nominally healthy individuals (n = 166), and risk-matched controls (n = 300) is reported. Diagnostic performance in lung cancer was stage-dependent, with markers for terminal (total) fucosylation, Œ±2-6 sialylation, Œ≤1-4 branching, Œ≤1-6 branching, and outer-arm fucosylation most able to differentiate cases from controls. These markers behaved in a similar stage-dependent manner in other types of cancer as well. Notable differences between certifiably healthy individuals and case-matched controls were observed. These markers were not significantly elevated in liver fibrosis. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the marker for Œ±2-6 sialylation was found to predict both progression and survival in lung cancer patients after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and stage.

NONO expression has been found altered in several tumor types, including prostate, colon, breast, melanoma, and in papillary renal carcinoma, in which an X chromosome inversion generates a NONO-TFE3 fusion protein. Upon such rearrangement, NONO loses its C-terminal domain. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified a putative degron motif, known to be recognized by the Skp1-Cul1-F-box-protein (SCF) complex. Here, we evaluated how this domain could affect NONO protein biology. We showed that NONO interacts with the nuclear FBW7Œ± isoform and its ubiquitination is regulated following modulation of the GSK3Œ≤ kinase. Mutation of T428A/T432A within the degron impaired polyubiquitination upon FBW7Œ± and GSK3Œ≤ overexpression.

DDAH1 regulates nitric oxide (NO) production by degrading endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). This study examined whether DDAH1 has any physiological role in PCa progression. Using overexpression of DDAH1 in PCa (PC3 and LNCaP) cell lines, we found that DDAH1 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion by lowering ADMA levels, as well as increasing NO production. VEGF, HIF-1Œ± and iNOS were upregulated in DDAH1 expressing cells as result of elevated NO. DDAH1 increased secretion of pro-angiogenic signals bFGF and IL-8, into conditioned media. Treatment of DDAH1-positive PCa cells with NOS inhibitors (L-NAME and 1400 W) attenuated DDAH1 activity to promote cell growth. Xenografts derived from these cells grew significantly faster (> twofold) than those derived from control cells. Proliferation rate of cells stably expressing mutant DDAH1 was same as control cells unlike wild-type DDAH1-positive PCa cells. Xenograft tumors derived from mutant-positive cells did not differ from control tumors. VEGF, HIF-1Œ± and iNOS expression did not differ in DDAH1 mutant-positive tumors compared to control tumors, but was upregulated in wild-type DDAH1 overexpressing tumors. Furthermore, CD31 immunostaining on xenograft tissues demonstrated that DDAH1 tumors had high endothelial content than mutant DDAH1 tumors. These data suggest that DDAH1 is an important mediator of PCa progression and NO/DDAH pathway needs to be considered in developing therapeutic strategies targeted at PCa.""","""['Karthik Reddy Kami Reddy', 'Chandrashekhar Dasari', 'Divya Duscharla', 'Bhukya Supriya', 'N Sai Ram', 'M V Surekha', 'Jerald Mahesh Kumar', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Angiogenesis""","""['Novel Cellularly Active Inhibitor Regresses DDAH1 Induced Prostate Tumor Growth by Restraining Tumor Angiogenesis through Targeting DDAH1/ADMA/NOS Pathway.', 'Active site mutant dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 expression confers an intermediate tumour phenotype in C6 gliomas.', 'HIF-1Œ± and Nrf2 regulates hypoxia induced overexpression of DDAH1 through promoter activation in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) on heart failure development.', 'Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase: a new therapeutic target for the modulation of nitric oxide and angiogenesis.', 'Evaluation of the Antioxidant and Antiangiogenic Activity of a Pomegranate Extract in BPH-1 Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Emerging roles of circ_NRIP1 in tumor development and cancer therapy (Review).', 'Biomarkers Found in the Tumor Interstitial Fluid may Help Explain the Differential Behavior Among Keratinocyte Carcinomas.', 'AMPK targets a proto-oncogene TPD52 (isoform 3) expression and its interaction with LKB1 suppress AMPK-GSK3Œ≤ signaling axis in prostate cancer.', 'Metformin May Alter the Metabolic Reprogramming in Cancer Cells by Disrupting the L-Arginine Metabolism: A Preliminary Computational Study.']"""

Because enzalutamide induces the CYP3A4 enzyme and taxanes are metabolized by this enzyme, a potential drug-drug interaction needs to be investigated.Experimental Design: Therefore, we performed a pharmacokinetic cross-over study in mCRPC patients who were scheduled for treatment with cabazitaxel Q3W (25 mg/m2). Patients were studied for three consecutive cabazitaxel cycles. Enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) was administered concomitantly after the first cabazitaxel cycle, during 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was the difference in mean area under the curve (AUC) between the first (cabazitaxel monotherapy) and third cabazitaxel cycle, when enzalutamide was added.Results: A potential clinically relevant 22% (95% CI, 9%-34%; P = 0.005) reduction in cabazitaxel exposure was found with concomitant enzalutamide use. The geometric mean AUC0-24h of cabazitaxel was 181 ng*h/mL (95% CI, 150-219 ng*h/mL) in cycle 3 and 234 ng*h/mL (95% CI, 209-261 ng*h/mL) in cycle 1. This combination did not result in excessive toxicity, whereas PSA response was promising.Conclusions: We found a significant decrease in cabazitaxel exposure when combined with enzalutamide. In an era of clinical trials on combination strategies for mCRPC, it is important to be aware of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. Because recent study results support the use of a lower standard cabazitaxel dose of 20 mg/m2, the clinical relevance of this interaction may be substantial, because the addition of enzalutamide may result in subtherapeutic cabazitaxel exposure.

The primary endpoint was a comparison of average of serum testosterone levels on treatment days 9 and 10 between groups.  Methods:   Men with progressive mCRPC, receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy, and with a serum testosterone level of <50ng/dl were randomized 1:1 to either AAFP 500mg daily plus 4mg methylprednisolone orally twice daily (BID), or OAA 1000mg daily plus 5mg prednisone BID for 84 days. Serum testosterone, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), steady-state (trough) abiraterone pharmacokinetics, and safety were evaluated.  Results:   Fifty-three patients were enrolled (n = 24, AAFP; n = 29, OAA). Mean age was 75.1 years and 54.7% had Gleason>7. Over 90% of patients in each group achieved absolute testosterone levels of ‚â§1ng/dl during the study. The averaged absolute testosterone levels ‚â§0.1ng/dl were achieved in 25% of AAFP-treated patients and 17% of OAA-treated patients. A PSA-50 response was observed in>65% of patients in both groups on days 28, 56, and 84 (P = NS, all timepoints). Days 9 and 10 averaged rounded-up least squares (LS) mean (SE) serum testosterone levels were comparable (1.05ng/dl [0.04], AAFP; 1.02ng/dl [0.03], OAA; P = 0.4703 for LS mean difference). The geometric mean ratio between groups was 1.021 (90% CI: 0.965-1.081); the 90% CI fell within 80.0% to 125.0% equivalence limits. The LS mean differences in abiraterone trough plasma concentrations were not statistically significant at any visit. Adverse event frequency was comparable between arms (75.0%, AAFP; 82.8%, OAA). Musculoskeletal events were more common among OAA-treated patients (37.9% vs. 12.5%).  Conclusion:   Therapeutic equivalence between AAFP 500mg daily and OAA 1000mg daily based on serum testosterone levels was confirmed in mCRPC patients.

Due to the limited suitability of current diagnostic biochemical markers, new biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer are highly sought after. An ideal biomarker should serve as a reliable prognostic marker, be applicable for early diagnosis, and be applicable for monitoring of therapeutic response. One potential candidate is glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which has a promising role for direct imaging. GCPII is considerably over-expressed on cancerous prostatic epithelial cells; its analysis typically follows radiological or spectrophotometric principles. Its role as a biomarker present in blood has been recently investigated and potential correlation between a concentration of GCPII and prostate cancer has been proposed. The wider inclusion of GCPII detection in clinical praxis limits mainly the time and cost per analysis. Here, we present a novel analytical nanosensor applicable to quantification of GCPII in human whole blood consisted of Fe3O4@Ag magnetic nanocomposite surface-functionalized by an artificial antibody (low-molecular-weight GCPII synthetic inhibitor). The nanocomposite allows a simple magnetic isolation of GCPII using external magnetic force and its consecutive determination by magnetically assisted surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MA-SERS) with a limit of detection 6 pmol.

This may degrade the plan quality and plan robustness. This study aims to mitigate the impact of the minimum MU constraint directly during the plan robust optimization.  Methods and materials:   Cao et al. have demonstrated a two-stage method to account for the minimum MU constraint using linear programming without the impact of uncertainties considered. In this study, we took the minimum MU constraint into consideration using quadratic optimization and simultaneously had the impact of uncertainties considered using robust optimization. We evaluated our method using seven cancer patients with different machine settings.  Result:   The new method achieved better plan quality than the conventional method. The D95% of the clinical target volume (CTV) normalized to the prescription dose was (mean [min-max]): (99.4% [99.2%-99.6%]) vs. (99.2% [98.6%-99.6%]). Plan robustness derived from these two methods was comparable. For all seven patients, the CTV dose-volume histogram band gap (narrower band gap means more robust plans) at D95% normalized to the prescription dose was (mean [min-max]): (1.5% [0.5%-4.3%]) vs. (1.2% [0.6%-3.8%]).

Methods:   Twenty-six men with histologically confirmed PCa underwent PET/CT immediately after injection of 369 ¬± 10 MBq 18F-FACBC (fluciclovine) followed by PET/MRI started 55 ¬± 7 min from injection. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were measured for both hybrid PET acquisitions. A separate mpMRI was acquired within a week of the PET scans. Logan plots were used to calculate volume of distribution (VT). The presence of PCa was estimated in 12 regions with radical prostatectomy findings as ground truth. For each imaging modality, area under the curve (AUC) for detection of PCa was determined to predict diagnostic performance. The clinical trial registration number is NCT02002455.  Results:   In the visual analysis, 164/312 (53%) regions contained PCa, and 41 tumor foci were identified. PET/CT demonstrated the highest sensitivity at 87% while its specificity was low at 56%. The AUC of both PET/MRI and mpMRI significantly (p < 0.01) outperformed that of PET/CT while no differences were detected between PET/MRI and mpMRI. SUVmax and VT of Gleason score (GS) >3 + 4 tumors were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those for GS 3 + 3 and benign hyperplasia. A total of 442 lymph nodes were evaluable for staging, and PET/CT and PET/MRI demonstrated true-positive findings in only 1/7 patients with metastatic lymph nodes.

To overcome these limitations we propagated and characterised a new collection of patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts. Tumour fragments from 147 unsupervised, surgical prostate samples were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient Rag2-/-Œ≥C-/- mice within 24 hours of surgery. Histologic and molecular characterisation of xenografts was compared with patient characteristics, including androgen-deprivation therapy, and exome sequencing. Xenografts were established from 47 of 147 (32%) implanted primary prostate cancers. Only 14% passaged successfully resulting in 20 stable lines; derived from 20 independent patient samples. Surprisingly, only three of the 20 lines (15%) were confirmed as prostate cancer; one line comprised of mouse stroma, and 16 were verified as human donor-derived lymphoid neoplasms. PCR for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) nuclear antigen, together with exome sequencing revealed that the lymphomas were exclusively EBV-associated. Genomic analysis determined that 14 of the 16 EBV+ lines had unique monoclonal or oligoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements, confirming their B-cell origin. We conclude that the generation of xenografts from tumour fragments can commonly result in B-cell lymphoma from patients carrying latent EBV.

Methods:   PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Embase (Ovid) databases were searched before (started from the building of the databases) February 4, 2017 for eligible cohort studies. We pooled the evidence included by a random- or fixed-effect model, according to the heterogeneity. A predefined subgroup analysis was conducted to see the potential discrepancy between groups. Sensitivity analysis was used to test whether our results were stale.  Results:   Nine cohort studies were eligible for meta-analysis with 2,570,790 male subjects. Our meta-analysis showed that, under the fixed-effect model, the pooled relevant risk (RR) of PCa was 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.11; P = .06; I = 24.00%) for men who had ever engaged in night shift work; and under the random-effect model, the pooled RR was 1.08 (0.99, 1.17; P = .08; I = 24.00%). Subgroup analysis showed the RR of PCa among males in western countries was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.11; P = .09; I = 0.00%), while among Asian countries it was 2.45 (95% CI: 1.19, 5.04; P = .02; I = 0.00%); and the RR was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.14; P = .40; I = 29.20%) for the high-quality group compared with 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.41; P = .02; I = 0.00%) for the moderate/low-quality group. Sensitivity analysis showed robust results.  Conclusions:   Based on the current evidence of cohort studies, we found no obvious association between night shift work and PCa.

We determined the median duration of the following: 1. Primary care intervals (IPCs): the first cancer-related general practitioner consultation to referral, 2. Referral intervals (IRs): referral to diagnosis, 3. Treatment intervals (ITs): diagnosis to treatment and the overarching intervals, 4. Diagnostic intervals (IDs): IPC and IR combined and 5.

Results:   For 465, 309, 197, 237 and 149 patients diagnosed with breast-, colorectal-, lung-, prostate cancer and melanoma, respectively; median IPC, IR and ID durations were shortest for breast cancer and melanoma (ID duration 7 and 21 days, respectively), intermediate for lung- and colon cancer (ID duration 49 and 54 days) and the longest for prostate cancer (ID duration 137 days). For all cancers, the duration of intervals increased steeply for the 10-25% with longest durations.

Cancer stage at diagnosis is an important outcome predictor. Studies have shown an inverse relationship to primary care physician (PCP) density and insurance coverage with stage of cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Data was obtained from OK2Share, an Oklahoma Central Cancer Registry, for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer from 2000 to 2010. Physician data was obtained through the State Licensing Board. The 2010 national census was used for population data. High PCP density was defined as greater than or equal to the median value: 3.17 PCP/10,000 persons. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze effects of PCP density, insurance status, and urologist presence on advanced stage diagnosis.  Results:   27,086 patients were identified across 77 counties. As PCP density increased by 1 PCP/10,000 persons, the odds ratios (OR) of an advanced stage at diagnosis were 0.383, 0.468, 0.543 for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer respectively. Compared to private insurance, being uninsured had OR of 1.61 and 2.45 respectively for kidney and prostate cancers. The OR of an advanced stage diagnosis for bladder and prostate cancer were 3.77 and 1.73, respectively, in counties with a urologist.  Conclusions:   Increased PCP density and insurance coverage reduced the odds of an advanced diagnosis. Implementation of policies to improve access to healthcare including through increasing PCP density and reducing the number of uninsured patients should result in diagnosis at an earlier stage, which will likely improved cancer-related outcomes.""","""['Kristy D Nguyen', 'Zain Z Hyder', 'Marshall D Shaw', 'Sarah B Maness', 'Michael S Cookson', 'Sanjay G Patel', 'Kelly L Stratton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Primary care physician supply, insurance type, and late-stage cancer diagnosis.', 'Association of insurance status and ethnicity with cancer stage at diagnosis for 12 cancer sites: a retrospective analysis.', 'The association of insurance and stage at diagnosis among patients aged 55 to 74 years in the national cancer database.', 'Urologic cancer in Thailand.', 'An official American Thoracic Society systematic review: insurance status and disparities in lung cancer practices and outcomes.', 'Geographic disparities in Saskatchewan prostate cancer incidence and its association with physician density: analysis using Bayesian models.', 'Associations of Medicaid Expansion With Insurance Coverage, Stage at Diagnosis, and Treatment Among Patients With Genitourinary Malignant Neoplasms.', 'Spatial distribution of advanced stage diagnosis and mortality of breast cancer: Socioeconomic and health service offer inequalities in Brazil.', ""Impact of Insurance Status on Diagnostic Stage in Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the United States: Implications for Detection and Outcomes."", 'Changes in Disparities in Stage of Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Pennsylvania After the Affordable Care Act.']"""

When the Physalis mottle virus (PhMV) coat protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, the resulting VLPs are nearly identical to the viruses formed in vivo. Here, we isolated PhMV-derived VLPs from ClearColi cells and carried out external and internal surface modification with fluorophores using reactive lysine-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and cysteine-maleimide chemistries, respectively. The uptake of dye-labeled particles was tested in a range of cancer cells and monitored by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. VLPs labeled internally on cysteine residues were taken up with high efficiency by several cancer cell lines and were colocalized with the endolysosomal marker LAMP-1 within 6 h, whereas VLPs labeled externally on lysine residues were taken up with lower efficiency, probably reflecting differences in surface charge and the propensity to bind to the cell surface. The infusion of dye and drug molecules into the cavity of the VLPs revealed that the photosensitizer (PS), Zn-EpPor, and the drugs crystal violet, mitoxantrone (MTX), and doxorubicin (DOX) associated stably with the carrier via noncovalent interactions. We confirmed the cytotoxicity of the PS-PhMV and DOX-PhMV particles against prostate cancer, ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, respectively.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 6 patients who underwent single perineal incision placement of a virgin AUS in 2014, 3 with simultaneous IPP placement. In all cases, the pressure regulating balloons (PRB) were placed in a high sub-muscular ectopic position and the pumps were placed into a sub-dartos pouch through the perineal incision, which was also validated using a cadaveric model.  Results:   The mean patient age was 61 (SD, 7.5 years) with mean body mass index of 31 (SD, 5.9). The average pre-operative pad usage was 7.7 (SD 1.63) pads per day.

Increased TAZ activity drives increased DNA synthesis and induces AMOTL2, ANKRD1, and CTGF gene transcription independently of YAP1. Ectopic expression of constitutively activated TAZ increases expression of these TAZ target genes and promotes cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells.

In eastern Slovakia, high exposure of the population to organochlorines (especially PCBs) was associated with various disease and disorder pathways, viz., endocrine disruption, metabolic disorder & diabetes, and cancer, thereby disturbing several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, stress response, and apoptosis. We have evaluated a Slovak cohort (45-month children, at lower and higher levels of PCB exposure from the environment) for disease and disorder development to develop early disease cancer biomarkers that could shed new light on possible mechanisms for the genesis of cancers under such chemical exposures, and identify potential avenues for prevention.Microarray studies of global gene expression were conducted from the 45-month-old children on the Affymetrix platform followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA¬Æ) to associate the affected genes with their mechanistic pathways. High-throughput qRT-PCR TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) was performed to further validate the selected genes on the whole blood cells of the most highly exposed children from the study cohort (n = 71). TP53, MYC, BCL2, and LRP12 differential gene expressions suggested strong relationships between potential future tumor promotion and PCB exposure in Slovak children. The IPA analysis further detected the most important signaling pathways, including molecular mechanism of cancers, prostate cancer signaling, ovarian cancer signaling, P53 signaling, oncostatin M signaling, and their respective functions (viz., prostate cancer, breast cancer, progression of tumor, growth of tumor, and non-Hodgkin's disease).

Clinicopathologic features were evaluated and NPV was calculated for detection of clinically significant (Gleason ‚â• 7) cancer. Regression analysis was performed to identify clinical predictors of biopsy outcome.  Results:   Overall, 88 (77.2%) patients in our cohort had no cancer detected upon biopsy. The highest pathologic grade was Gleason 6 (3 + 3) in 22 (19.3%) patients, and Gleason ‚â• 7 in 4 (3.6%) patients.

An miRNA microarray analysis has previously revealed a significant decrease in miR-193a-3p levels in prostate cancer tissues compared with that in their benign prostate hyperplasia counterparts. However, the role of miR-193a-3p has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to evaluate the expression levels of miR-193a-3p in two human prostate cancer cell lines. Forced overexpression of miR-193a-3p was established by transfecting mimics into DU-145 and PC3 cell lines. Cell proliferation and the cell cycle were assessed using a cell viability assay, flow cytometry and a colony formation assay. In addition, the target gene of miR-193a-3p was determined by a luciferase assay, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The regulation of the cell cycle by miR-193a-3p was also evaluated by western blotting. The results demonstrated that miR-193a-3p expression levels were lower in prostate cancer cell lines as compared with the RWPE normal prostate epithelium cell line. Subsequent gain-of-function studies revealed that stable miR-193a-3p transfection inhibited cell viability, proliferation and colony formation, and induced G1 phase arrest in prostate cancer cells. A luciferase assay and western blot analysis identified cyclin D1 (CCND1) as a direct target gene of miR-193a-3p. In addition, the forced expression of CCND1 was able to counter the inhibitory effects of miR-193a-3p transfection in the prostate cancer cells. In summary, the results suggest that miR-193a-3p may inhibit the viability, proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression profile of CCND1, and that miR-193a-3p may be a novel therapeutic biomarker for prostate cancer.""","""['Yunfu Liu', 'Xin Xu', 'Xianglai Xu', 'Shiqi Li', 'Zhen Liang', 'Zhenghui Hu', 'Jian Wu', 'Yi Zhu', 'Xiaodong Jin', 'Xiao Wang', 'Yiwei Lin', 'Hong Chen', 'Yeqing Mao', 'Jindan Luo', 'Xiangyi Zheng', 'Liping Xie']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['MiR-193a-5p and -3p Play a Distinct Role in Gastric Cancer: miR-193a-3p Suppresses Gastric Cancer Cell Growth by Targeting ETS1 and CCND1.', 'MiR-193a-3p inhibits pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell proliferation by targeting CCND1.', 'MiR-193a-3p functions as a tumour suppressor in human aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma by down-regulating CYP11B2.', 'MicroRNA-501-3p restricts prostate cancer growth through regulating cell cycle-related and expression-elevated protein in tumor/cyclin D1 signaling.', 'Biological Function of MicroRNA193a-3p in Health and Disease.', 'MicroRNAs in cancer metastasis: biological and therapeutic implications.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'SMAD3 and FTO are involved in miR-5581-3p-mediated inhibition of cell migration and proliferation in bladder cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'Micro RNAs as potential biomarkers in tuberculosis: A systematic review.']"""

Herbal Medicament (HM) is a standardized hexane-soluble fraction of C. longa and is well known for its neuroprotective effect.  Objective:   In this study, we attempted to synthesize a novel chemically modified bioactive fraction from HM (NCCL) along with isolation and characterization of a novel marker compound (I).  Materials and methods:   NCCL was prepared from HM. The chemical structure of the marker compound isolated from NCCL was determined from 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared. The compound so isolated was subjected to in silico and in vitro screenings to test its inhibitory effect on estrogen receptors.  Results:   Molecular docking studies revealed that the binding poses of the compound I was energetically favorable. Among NCCL and compound I taken for in vitro studies, NCCL had exhibited good anti-cancer activity over compound I against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, DU-145, and PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   This is the first study about the synthesis of a chemically modified bioactive fraction which used a standardized extract since the preparation of the HM. It may be concluded that NCCL fraction having residual components induce more cell death than compound I alone. Thus, NCCL may be used as a potent therapeutic drug.  Summary:   In the present paper, a standardized hexane soluble fraction of Curcuma longa (HM) was chemically modified to give a novel bioactive fraction (NCCL). A novel marker compound was isolated from NCCL and was characerized using various spectral techniques. The compound so isolated was investigated for in-silico screenings. NCCL and isolated compound was subjected to in-vitro anti-cancer screenings against MCF 7, MDA MB 231 (breast adenocarcinoma) and DU 145 and PC 3 cell lines (androgen independent human prostate cancer cells). The virtual screenings reveals that isolated compound has shown favourable drug like properties. NCCL fraction having residual components induces more cell death in these four cancer cell lines than isolated compound alone.

Interestingly, our evaluation of a standardized Wedelia chinensis herbal extract (WCE) concluded its efficacy on hormone-refractory prostate cancer through systemic mechanisms. Oral administration of WCE significantly attenuated tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic PC-3 and DU145 xenografts. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of these tumors revealed that WCE suppressed the expression of IKKŒ±/Œ≤ phosphorylation and downstream cytokines/chemokines, e.g., IL6, CXCL1, and CXCL8. Through restraining the cytokines expression, WCE reduced tumor-elicited infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and endothelial cells into the tumors, therefore inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. In MDSCs, WCE also reduced STAT3 activation, downregulated S100A8 expression and prevented their expansion. Use of WCE in combination with docetaxel significantly suppressed docetaxel-induced NFŒ∫B activation, boosted the therapeutic effect and reduced the systemic toxicity caused by docetaxel monotherapy.

We show that the tyrosine kinase PTK6 (BRK) is a PTEN substrate. Phosphorylation of PTK6 tyrosine 342 (PY342) promotes activation, while phosphorylation of tyrosine 447 (PY447) regulates auto-inhibition. Introduction of PTEN into a PTEN null prostate cancer cell line leads to dephosphorylation of PY342 but not PY447 and PTK6 inhibition. Conversely, PTEN knockdown promotes PTK6 activation in PTEN positive cells. Using a variety of PTEN mutant constructs, we show that protein phosphatase activity of PTEN targets PTK6, with efficiency similar to PTP1B, a phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates PTK6 Y342.

Its expression correlates inversely with survival and increases with tumor grade. However, the biological role of PSMA has not been explored, and its role in prostate cancer remained elusive. Filling this gap, we demonstrate that in prostate cancer, PSMA initiates signaling upstream of PI3K through G protein-coupled receptors, specifically via the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). PSMA's carboxypeptidase activity releases glutamate from vitamin B9 and other glutamated substrates, which activate mGluR I. Activated mGluR I subsequently induces activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) through phosphorylation of p110Œ≤ independent of PTEN loss. The p110Œ≤ isoform of PI3K plays a particularly important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, but the origin of its activation was so far unknown. PSMA expression correlated with PI3K-Akt signaling in cells, animal models, and patients. We interrogated the activity of the PSMA-PI3K axis through positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

Whether MYC tumor expression at the protein or mRNA level is associated with poorer prognosis has not been well studied.Methods: We conducted a cohort study including 634 men from the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 1983-2004 and followed up for a median of 13.7 years. MYC protein expression was evaluated using IHC, and we used Cox regression to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of its association with lethal prostate cancer (distant metastases/prostate cancer-related death). We assessed the association between MYC mRNA expression and lethal prostate cancer in a case-control study, including 113 lethal cases and 291 indolent controls.Results: MYC nuclear protein expression was present in 97% of tumors. MYC protein expression was positively correlated with tumor proliferation rate (r = 0.37; P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with apoptotic count (r = -0.17; P < 0.001). There were no significant associations between MYC protein expression and stage, grade, or PSA level at diagnosis. The multivariable HR for lethal prostate cancer among men in the top versus bottom quartile of MYC protein expression was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.50-2.35).

Therefore, the identification of novel molecular mechanism regulating cancer progression and achievement of new insight into target therapy would be necessary for improving the benefits of PCa patients. This study aims to study the function and regulatory mechanism of HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in PCa progression.  Methods:   MSKCC and TCGA datasets were used to identify miR-193a expression profile in PCa. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, colony formation, invasion, migration, flow cytometry, a xenograft model and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to detect and analyze the biological function of miR-193a. Then, we assessed the role of HOTAIR and EZH2 in regulation of miR-193a expression by using plasmid, lentivirus and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detect the transcriptional activation of miR-193a by EZH2 and HOTAIR. Further, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to examine the regulatory role of miR-193a controlling the HOTAIR expression in PCa. Finally, the correlation between HOTAIR, EZH2 and miR-193a expression were analyzed using In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We found that miR-193a was significantly downregulated in metastatic PCa through mining MSKCC and TCGA datasets. In vitro studies revealed that miR-193a inhibited PCa cell growth, suppressed migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis; in vivo results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-193a mediated by lentivirus dramatically reduced PCa xenograft tumor growth. Importantly, we found EZH2 coupled with HOTAIR to repress miR-193a expression through trimethylation of H3K27 at miR-193a promoter in PC3 and DU145 cells. Interestingly, further evidence illustrated that miR-193a directly targets HOTAIR showing as significantly reduced HOTAIR level in miR-193a overexpressed cells and tissues. The expression level of miR-193a was inversely associated with that of HOTAIR and EZH2 in PCa.  Conclusion:   This study firstly demonstrated that miR-193a acted as tumor suppressor in CRPC and the autoregulatory feedback loop of HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a served an important mechanism in PCa development. Targeting this aberrantly activated feedback loop may provide a potential therapeutic strategy.""","""['Zhixin Ling', 'Xiaoyan Wang', 'Tao Tao', 'Lei Zhang', 'Han Guan', 'Zonghao You', 'Kai Lu', 'Guangyuan Zhang', 'Shuqiu Chen', 'Jianping Wu', 'Jinke Qian', 'Hui Liu', 'Bin Xu', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['HOTAIR-mediated reciprocal regulation of EZH2 and DNMT1 contribute to polyphyllin I-inhibited growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development.', 'Involvement of EZH2 in aerobic glycolysis of prostate cancer through miR-181b/HK2 axis.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Emerging roles of HOTAIR in human cancer.', 'Up-regulation of exosomal miR-125a in pneumoconiosis inhibits lung cancer development by suppressing expressions of EZH2 and hnRNPK.', 'High expression of small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 predicts poor prognosis and promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer by activating transforming growth factor-beta signaling.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'Roles of Key Epigenetic Regulators in the Gene Transcription and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

However, many patients with cancer fail to respond to compounds that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, and the underlying mechanism(s) is not well understood. Recent studies revealed that response to PD-1-PD-L1 blockade might correlate with PD-L1 expression levels in tumour cells. Hence, it is important to understand the mechanistic pathways that control PD-L1 protein expression and stability, which can offer a molecular basis to improve the clinical response rate and efficacy of PD-1-PD-L1 blockade in patients with cancer. Here we show that PD-L1 protein abundance is regulated by cyclin D-CDK4 and the cullin 3-SPOP E3 ligase via proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 (hereafter CDK4/6) in vivo increases PD-L1 protein levels by impeding cyclin D-CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) and thereby promoting SPOP degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex activator FZR1. Loss-of-function mutations in SPOP compromise ubiquitination-mediated PD-L1 degradation, leading to increased PD-L1 levels and reduced numbers of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in mouse tumours and in primary human prostate cancer specimens.

Materials and methods:   Sixty patients operated by a single surgeon were enrolled and data collected prospectively. This cohort was compared with another consecutive 60 patients operated with standard anastomosis. The new technique is based on preventing urethral retraction of the posterior urethra with two anastomosis sutures being used as stay sutures. The outcomes were prospectively followed and groups compared regarding early continence. International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form was used to assess incontinence and its impact on the quality of life. Pad use (yes or no pads) was evaluated as a more stringent criterion.  Results:   Preoperative patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. Anastomosis was completed faster in PURS group (15.1 vs 18.5 min, p = 0.05). At postoperative week 1 and month 1, the severity and bother of incontinence were significantly less in the PURS group (12.7 vs 4.1 and 10.1 vs 2.6, p < 0.001). PURS cohort reported significantly superior pad-free rates at both postoperative month 1 (73% vs 35%, p < 0.0001) and month 3 (83% vs 53%, p = 0.0004). On multivariable analysis, younger age and the new anastomosis technique were two independent predictors to improve early continence. Four patients in modified anastomosis group (4/60) and 1 in standard anastomosis group (1/60) necessitated temporary urethral recatheterization because of urinary retention.  Conclusion:   We describe a simple and time-efficient modified urethrovesical anastomosis technique by using anastomosis sutures as stay sutures to prevent perineal retraction of the urethral stump. Our results demonstrated that the technique is an independent factor impacting early recovery of urinary continence.

Ionoacoustic range verification requires recovering the location of an acoustic source from low frequency signals. A priori information is applied to stably overcome resolution limits of inverse acoustic source imaging in this simulation study. In particular, the accuracy and robustness of ionoacoustic range verification for lateral and oblique delivery of high-energy protons to the prostate is examined.  Methods:   Dose maps were computed using GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations via the TOPAS user interface. Thermoacoustic pulses were propagated using k-Wave software, with initial pressures corresponding to instantaneous dose deposition and piecewise constant maps of tissue properties derived from the planning CT. A database of dose maps with corresponding thermoacoustic emissions and Bragg peak locations, referred to as ""control points,"" were precomputed. Corresponding thermoacoustic emissions were also precomputed. Pulses were recorded at four coplanar locations corresponding to the outer surface of a virtual transrectal array. To model experimental beam delivery, k-Wave results were convolved in time with a Gaussian envelope to account for noninstantaneous proton delivery by a synchrocyclotron. Thermoacoustic pulses were bandlimited below 150 kHz, and amplitudes were directly proportional to charge delivered. To test robustness of our method, white noise was added. Range was estimated in a two-step process. The first step obtained a preliminary range estimate by one-way beamforming. The second step was taken using data corresponding to the ""control point"" nearest to the preliminary range estimate. For each receiver, the time of flight difference, ‚àÜt, between the measured and control thermoacoustic signals were accurately estimated by applying the Fourier shift theorem. Receiver-Bragg peak distance was then estimated by adding vs ‚àÜt to the known distance of the control point, where vs is soundspeed. A linear system of equations based upon all receiver locations and distances was solved to recover the Bragg peak location. All simulations were performed relative to the planning CT. Because ultrasound (US) images were not available, results were overlaid onto the planning CT.  Results:   Beamformed estimates from noise-free data tracked all beam locations within 1 cm. Final estimates for oblique and lateral beams were accurate to within 1.0 and 1.6 mm respectively. Average errors of final range estimates for oblique beams from data with SNR = 0 dB were no greater than 2.0 mm.  Conclusions:   Ionoacoustic range verification may improve current practice. Ionoacoustic range estimates can be inherently co-registered to ultrasound images of underlying anatomy. To ensure estimates are robust in clinical practice, dose maps based upon the planning CT should be overlaid onto ultrasound volumes acquired at time of treatment and acoustic simulations re-computed to provide a database of control points and corresponding thermoacoustic emissions. Computation times for beamformed estimates are already fast enough for online range verification, but are not accurate enough for a measurement aperture limited to the surface of a transrectal ultrasound probe. Accelerated acoustic simulations will be required to enable online two-stage correction, but offline calculation is already suitable for adaptive planning.""","""['Sarah K Patch', 'Daniel E M Hoff', 'Tyler B Webb', 'Lee G Sobotka', 'Tianyu Zhao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Thermoacoustic range verification in the presence of acoustic heterogeneity and soundspeed errors - Robustness relative to ultrasound image of underlying anatomy.', 'Thermoacoustic range verification during pencil beam delivery of a clinical plan to an abdominal imaging phantom.', 'Ionoacoustic characterization of the proton Bragg peak with submillimeter accuracy.', 'Ionizing radiation-induced acoustics for radiotherapy and diagnostic radiology applications.', 'Range uncertainties in proton therapy and the role of Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Secondary Particle Interactions in a Compton Camera Designed for in vivo Range Verification of Proton Therapy.', 'Towards in vivo Dosimetry for Prostate Radiotherapy with a Transperineal Ultrasound Array: A Simulation Study.', 'Bragg Peak Localization with Piezoelectric Sensors for Proton Therapy Treatment.', 'X-ray induced acoustic computed tomography.', 'Acoustic Localization of Bragg Peak Proton Beams for Hadrontherapy Monitoring.']"""

The DOTA-conjugate PSMA-617 has proven high potential in PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) of prostate cancer as well as PET imaging when labeled with lutetium-177 and gallium-68 respectively. Considering the relatively short physical half-life of gallium-68 this positron emitter precludes prolonged acquisition periods, as required for pre-therapeutic dosimetry or intraoperative applications. In this context, the positron emitter scandium-44 is an attractive alternative for PET imaging. We report the synthesis of [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 as radiopharmaceutical with generator produced scandium-44, its in vitro characterization and clinical translation as part of a first in-human study.  Methods:   Scandium-44 was obtained from a 44Ti/44Sc radionuclide generator. PSMA-617 was labeled with 142.4¬±12.7 MBq of scandium-44 in analogy to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 and evaluated in vitro and in cell studies using PSMA+ LNCaP cells. A first-in-human investigation was subsequently carried out in a cohort of 4 patients (mean age 70¬±1.8 a) registered for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. 50.5¬±9.3 MBq (40 ¬µg, 38.4 nmol) [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 were applied via intravenous injection (i.v.), respectively. A Siemens Biograph 2 PET/CT system was used to acquire initial dynamic PET data (30 min) of abdomen in list mode followed by static PET/CT data (skull to mid-thigh) at 45 min, 2 and 18 h post-injection (p.i.). For quantitative analysis, dynamic images were reconstructed as 6 data sets of 300 s each. The noise ratio was measured in liver, lung and an additional region outside the body. SUV values in different organs and lesions were measured and compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 data of the same patients. Residence times and organ absorbed doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software.  Results:   Quantitative radiochemical yields of ‚â•98 % were achieved using 18 nmol of PSMA-617 after 20 min at 95 ¬∞C with apparent molar activity of 6.69¬±0.78 MBq/nmol. Following purification, >99 % radiochemical purity was obtained. [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 showed high stability (>95 %) in serum for 24 h. The binding affinity and internalization fraction were determined in PSMA+ LNCaP cells (IC50 = 4.72¬±0.7 nM and internalization fraction: 15.78¬±2.14 % IA/106 LNCaP cells) and compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (12.0¬±2.8 nM and 9.47¬±2.56 % IA/106 LNCaP cells). Physiological tracer uptake was observed in kidneys, liver, spleen, small intestine, urinary bladder, and salivary glands and pathological uptake in both soft and skeletal metastases. SUV values were significantly lower in the kidneys (14.0) compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 OET (30.5). All other measured SUV values did not show a statistically significant difference. Tumor to liver ratios were found to lie between 1.9 and 8.3 for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and between 2.5 and 8.8 for [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 after 120 min. For [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 the ratios were higher and no statistically significant differences were observed. Total and % activity were highest in liver followed by kidneys, spleen, small intestine and salivary glands. Rapid wash out was seen in liver and spleen and gradually over time in kidneys. Kidneys received the highest radiation absorbed dose of 0.354 (0.180-0.488) mSv/MBq. No adverse pharmacological effects were observed.  Conclusion:   In conclusion [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 PET is suitable for PET imaging of prostate cancer tissue. [44Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 shows promise to enable pre-therapeutic dosimetry in clinical settings. However, the clinical advantages for individual dosimetry or other applications like intraoperative applications have to be investigated in further studies.""","""['Elisabeth Eppard', 'Ana de la Fuente', 'Martina Bene≈°ov√°', 'Ambreen Khawar', 'Ralph A Bundschuh', 'Florian C G√§rtner', 'Barbara Kreppel', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Markus Essler', 'Frank R√∂sch']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['44ScSc-PSMA-617 Biodistribution and Dosimetry in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Prediction of Normal Organ Absorbed Doses for 177LuLu-PSMA-617 Using 44ScSc-PSMA-617 Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', '(68)Ga-radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging of infection and inflammation.', 'Cyclotron production of 43Sc and 44gSc from enriched 42CaO, 43CaO, and 44CaO targets.', 'Scandium-44: Diagnostic Feasibility in Tumor-Related Angiogenesis.', 'Engineering a modular 44Ti/44Sc generator: eluate evaluation in preclinical models and estimation of human radiation dosimetry.', 'Sc-HOPO: A Potential Construct for Use in Radioscandium-Based Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Current State of 44Ti/44Sc Radionuclide Generator Systems and Separation Chemistry.']"""

Then the integrated device can be put in the ELISA reader for signal analysis after sample incubation, no necessary of further fluorescence staining or microscopy counting. Result: The integrated device has wide liner detection ranges (0.05-25 ng/mL for both PSA and VEGF, and 5-300 cells/mL for PCa CTC), as well as high levels of sensitivity and selectivity, and demonstrated a high correlation with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for sample detection in patients. Also, the presented biochips could maintain their stability when stored at 37¬∞C for 49 days without significant differences in the red-shift (<5%).

In this study, we prepared a theranostic nanoformulation that allows for photoacoustic imaging as well as combination gene and photothermal therapy. Gold nanorods (GNR) were coated with dipicolyl amine (DPA), which forms stable complexes with Zn2+ cations. The resulting nanoparticles, Zn(II)/DPA-GNR, recognize phosphate-containing molecules, including siRNA, because of the specific interaction between Zn(II) and the phosphates. We chose anti-polo-like kinase 1 siRNA (siPLK) as our example for gene silencing. The strong complexation between Zn(II)/DPA-GNR and siPLK provided high stability to the nano-complexes, which efficiently delivered siRNA into the targeted cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The particle served as a theranostic agent because the GNRs of nano-complexes permitted effective photothermal therapy as well as photoacoustic imaging upon laser irradiation. This gene/photothermal combination therapy using siPLK/Zn(II)DPA-GNRs exhibited significant antitumor activity in a PC-3 tumor mouse model.

Results:   Men receiving a phi test showed a significant reduction in biopsy procedures performed when compared to the historical control group (36.4% vs. 60.3%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Based on questionnaire responses, the phi score impacted the physician's patient management plan in 73% of cases, including biopsy deferrals when the phi score was low, and decisions to perform biopsies when the phi score indicated an intermediate or high probability of prostate cancer (phi ‚â•36).  Conclusions:   phi testing significantly impacted the physician's biopsy decision for men with tPSA in the 4-10 ng/ml range and non-suspicious DRE findings. Appropriate utilization of phi resulted in a significant reduction in biopsy procedures performed compared to historical patients seen by the same participating urologists who would have met enrollment eligibility but did not receive a phi test.""","""['Jay White', 'B Vittal Shenoy', 'Ronald F Tutrone', 'Lawrence I Karsh', 'Daniel R Saltzstein', 'William J Harmon', 'Dennis L Broyles', 'Tamra E Roddy', 'Lori R Lofaro', 'Carly J Paoli', 'Dwight Denham', 'Mark A Reynolds']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""[""Reply to 'Clinical utility of the Prostate Health Index (phi) for biopsy decision management in a large group urology practice setting'."", ""Reply to Letter to the Editor re: 'Clinical utility of the Prostate Health Index (phi) for biopsy decision management in a large group urology practice setting'."", 'Second Reply to Letter to the Editor re: ""Clinical utility of the Prostate Health Index (phi) for biopsy decision management in a large group urology practice setting"".', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Extended use of Prostate Health Index and percentage of -2pro-prostate-specific antigen in Chinese men with prostate specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL and normal digital rectal examination.', 'The application of p2PSA% and prostate health index in prostate cancer detection: A\xa0prospective cohort in a Tertiary Medical Center.', 'Challenges in prostate biopsies : From the perspective of practicing urologists and professional policy perspective.', 'Cancer Associated Macrophage-like Cells Are Prognostic for Highly Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Both the Non-Metastatic and Metastatic Settings.', 'Utility of Prostate-Specific Antigen Isoforms and Prostate Health Index in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate health index (PHI) as an accurate prostate cancer predictor.', 'Development of a novel nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with the prostate health index and multiparametric MRI.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: protocol for updating multiple systematic reviews to inform a Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline update.']"""

Derived from this study, we here present three cases that were diagnosed with NF1 germline mutations but did not have a prior clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Design:   We performed genetic analysis of known tumor predisposition genes, including NF1, using a multi-gene NGS enrichment-based panel applied to a total of 1029 PPGL patients. We did not exclude genes known to cause clinically defined syndromes such as NF1 based on missing phenotypic expression as is commonly practiced.  Methods:   Genetic analysis was performed using NGS (TruSight Cancer Panel/customized panel by Illumina) for analyzing patients' blood and tumor samples. Validation was carried out by Sanger sequencing.  Results:   Within our cohort, three patients, who were identified to carry pathogenic NF1 germline mutations, attracted attention, since none of the patients had a clinical suspicion of NF1 and one of them was initially suspected to have MEN2A syndrome due to co-occurrence of a medullary thyroid carcinoma. In these cases, one splice site, one stop and one frameshift mutation in NF1 were identified.  Conclusions:   Since phenotypical presentation of NF1 is highly variable, we suggest analysis of the NF1 gene also in PPGL patients who do not meet diagnostic NF1 criteria. Co-occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma and PPGL was found to be a clinical decoy in NF1 diagnostics.

Although the androgen receptor (AR) has been linked to therapy failure, the underlying escape mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Being closely related to the AR, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been suggested to play a role in enzalutamide and docetaxel resistance. Given that glucocorticoids are frequently applied to prostate cancer patients, it is essential to unravel the exact role of the GR in prostate cancer progression.Experimental Design: Assessment of GR expression and functional significance in tissues from 177 prostate cancer patients, including 14 lymph node metastases, as well as in several human prostate cancer models, including androgen-dependent, androgen-independent, and long-term antiandrogen-treated cell lines.Results: Although GR expression is reduced in primary prostate cancer tissue, it is restored in metastatic lesions. Relapse patients with high GR experience shortened progression-free survival. GR is significantly increased upon long-term abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment in the majority of preclinical models, thus identifying GR upregulation as an underlying mechanism for cells to bypass AR blockade. Importantly, GR inhibition by RNAi or chemical blockade results in impaired proliferation and 3D-spheroid formation in all tested cell lines.Conclusions: GR upregulation seems to be a common mechanism during antiandrogen treatment and supports the notion that targeting the GR pathway combined with antiandrogen medication may further improve prostate cancer therapy.

Methods:   This prospective study enrolled 113 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent MRI before radical prostatectomy. Continence was evaluated using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite instrument before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postoperatively. We developed a novel parameter, minimal residual membranous urethral length (mRUL), defined as the distance between the lower margins of the puboperinealis and bulbospongiosus muscles in a direction parallel with the urethra on preoperative MRI, which is supposed to represent the minimal intact residual part of the membranous urethra during RP. Thicknesses of the levator ani and periurethral sphincter complex were also estimated on MRI.  Results:   Continence recovery was significantly faster in patients with longer mRUL (‚â•6.4 mm) than in patients with shorter mRUL (<6.4 mm; log-rank test, P = .003). Interestingly, incontinence rate before radical prostatectomy was significantly lower in patients with longer mRUL (2.0%) than in those with shorter mRUL (17.5%; P = .008). Multivariate analysis showed that longer mRUL was significantly related to superior continence recovery (hazard ratio, 0.78; P = .005).

CD44v6, generated by alternative splicing of CD44, has been proposed as a CSC biomarker due to its correlation with aggressive PCa disease. We hypothesized that phage display selected peptides that target CD44v6 may serve as theranostic agents for aggressive PCa. Here, a 15 amino acid peptide (""PFT"") was identified by affinity selection against a peptide derived from the v6 region of CD44v6. Synthesized PFT exhibited specific binding to CD44v6 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 743.4 nM. PFT also bound CD44v6 highly expressed on human PCa cell lines. Further, an aggressive form of PCa cells (v6A3) was isolated and tagged by a novel CSC reporter vector. The v6A3 cells had a CSC-like phenotype including enriched CD44v6 expression, enhanced clonogenicity, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and generation of heterogeneous offspring. PFT exhibited preferential binding to v6A3 cells compared to parental cells. Immunohistofluorescence studies with human PCa tissue microarrays (TMA) indicated that PFT was highly accurate in detecting CD44v6-positive aggressive PCa cells, and staining positivity was significantly higher in late stage, metastatic and higher-grade samples. Taken together, this study provides for the first time phage display selected peptides that target CD44v6 overexpressed on PCa cells.

Salen-Mn is a novel type of synthetic reagent bionic and exerts remarkable anticancer activities. However, the effect of Salen-Mn on human prostate cancer has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we found that treatment of PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cells with Salen-Mn inhibited cell growth in dose and time dependent manner. Moreover, Salen-Mn induced cell apoptosis, and increased the expression of apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that Salen-Mn induced expression of LC3-I/II, which is protein marker of cell autophagy, in both dose and time dependent manners; in addition, Salen-Mn increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, suggesting that Salen-Mn increase cell autophagy through activating AMPK pathway. On the other hand, when PC-3 and DU145 cells were treated with Salen-Mn and 3-MA, an inhibitor of cell autophagy, the inhibitory effect of Salen-Mn on cell growth and the induction of apoptotic proteins were decreased. In addition, we found that Salen-Mn inhibited the growth of PC-3 cell xenografts in nude mice.

ELAS1 appears to be safe because it induced apoptosis only in cancer cells, not in normal KD cells. Because the effect of ELAS1 is dependent on increased stability of p53 and enhanced phosphorylation of p53-S46, we exogenously expressed wild-type p53 protein to fully promote ELAS1-mediated induction of apoptosis in SAS cells. Interestingly, simultaneous expression of Myc-ELAS1 and FLAG-p53 mediated by an internal ribosome entry site efficiently induced apoptosis in SAS cells. Moreover, we prepared a recombinant adenovirus that simultaneously expressed Myc-ELAS1 and FLAG-p53. This adenovirus also killed SAS cells, as determined by a cell viability assay, in the presence of camptothecin, an inducer of DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, nude mice harboring Myc-ELAS1-expressing SAS cells lived longer than mice harboring Myc-vector-expressing SAS cells, suggesting the usefulness of ELAS1 in vivo.

Although prostate cancer can arise throughout the prostate, it is more frequent in the peripheral zone. In contrast, hyperplasia occurs most frequently in the transitional zone. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that peripheral and transitional zones have distinct metabolic adaptations that may underlie their different inherent predispositions to cancer and hyperplasia. In order to do this, we undertook RNA sequencing and high-throughput metabolic analyses of non-cancerous tissue from the peripheral and transitional zones of patients undergoing prostatectomy. Integrated analysis of RNAseq and metabolomic data revealed that transcription of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis is higher in the peripheral zone, which was mirrored by an increase in fatty acid metabolites, such as lysolipids. The peripheral zone also exhibited increased fatty acid catabolic activity and contained higher level of neurotransmitters. Such increased capacity for de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, which is characteristic of prostate cancer, can potentially provide a permissive growth environment within the peripheral zone for cancer growth and also transmit a metabolic growth advantage to newly emerging clones themselves.

When compared to blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), this 5hmC-based biomarker had a lower performance in PCa detection than the use of a PSA cut-off of 2.5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Above this threshold, however, it delineated almost three quarters of PCa patients from controls and patients with other prostate pathologies. Overall, genome-wide 5hmC content of WBC DNA appears to be applicable for detecting non-cancerous prostate diseases, rather than PCa. Our results also suggest a potential clinical usefulness of complementing PSA as a PCa marker by the addition of a set of hydroxymethylation markers in the blood, but further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.""","""['Alin Grelus', 'Dragos V Nica', 'Imola Miklos', 'Valerica Belengeanu', 'Ioan Ioiart', 'Cristina Popescu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer differentiation via platelet to lymphocyte ratio.', 'Circulating Levels of Omentin, Leptin, VEGF, and HGF and Their Clinical Relevance with PSA Marker in Prostate Cancer.', 'IGF-II serum levels increase discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and improve the predictive value of PSA in clinical staging.', 'Prostate tissue and serum markers.', 'The role of TET-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation in prostate cancer.', 'Serum YKL-40 Levels in Patients with Asthma or COPD: A Pilot Study.', 'DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation in Cervical Cancer: Diagnosis, Prognosis and Treatment.', 'DNA hydroxymethylation combined with carotid plaques as a novel biomarker for coronary atherosclerosis.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening outcomes for different histologic subtypes of ovarian cancers.  Methods:   Women in the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Screening Trial underwent CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound annually for 3-5 years. We compared screening test characteristics (including overdiagnosis) and outcomes by tumour type (type II versus other) and study arm (screening versus usual care).  Results:   Of 78,215 women randomised, 496 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Of the tumours that were characterised (n = 413; 83%), 74% (n = 305) were type II versus 26% other (n = 108). Among screened patients, 70% of tumours were type II compared to 78% in usual care (p = 0.09). Within the screening arm, 29% of type II tumours were screen detected compared to 54% of the others (p < 0.01). The sensitivity of screening was 65% for type II tumours versus 86% for other types (p = 0.02). 15% of type II screen-detected tumours were stage I/II, compared to 81% of other tumours (p < 0.01). The overdiagnosis rate was lower for type II compared to other tumours (28.2% versus 72.2%; p < 0.01). Ovarian cancer-specific survival was worse for type II tumours compared to others (p < 0.01). Survival was similar for type II (p = 0.74) or other types (p = 0.32) regardless of study arm.  Conclusions:   Test characteristics of screening for ovarian cancer differed for type II tumours compared to other ovarian tumours. Type II tumours were less likely to be screen diagnosed, early stage at diagnosis or overdiagnosed.""","""['Sarah M Temkin', 'Eric A Miller', 'Goli Samimi', 'Christine D Berg', 'Paul Pinsky', 'Lori Minasian']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Evidence of Stage Shift in Women Diagnosed With Ovarian Cancer During Phase II of the United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study.', 'Sensitivity and specificity of multimodal and ultrasound screening for ovarian cancer, and stage distribution of detected cancers: results of the prevalence screen of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS).', 'Ovarian cancer screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial: findings from the initial screen of a randomized trial.', 'Ovarian cancer screening-ultrasound; impact on ovarian cancer mortality.', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'A review of co-registered transvaginal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging for ovarian cancer diagnosis.', 'Future Screening Prospects for Ovarian Cancer.', 'Efficacy of an optimal ovarian cancer screening: a best-case scenario study based on real-world data.', 'CA125 and Ovarian Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Endometriosis-Associated Ovarian Cancer: The Origin and Targeted Therapy.']"""

Unfortunately, a majority of PCa patients under androgen ablation progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Several mechanisms including alternative intra-prostatic androgen production and androgen-independent androgen receptor (AR) activation have been proposed for CRPC progression. Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), a multi-functional steroid metabolizing enzyme, is specifically expressed in the cytoplasm of PCa cells; and positive immunoreactivity of the type A Œ≥-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR), an ionotropic receptor and ligand-gated ion channel, is detected on the membrane of PCa cells. We studied a total of 72 radical prostatectomy cases by immunohistochemistry, and identified that 21 cases exhibited positive immunoreactivities for both AKR1C3 and GABAAR. In the dual positive cancer cases, AKR1C3 and GABAAR subunit Œ±1 were either expressed in the same cells or in neighboring cells. Among several possible substrates, AKR1C3 reduces 5Œ±-dihydrotesterone (DHT) to form 5Œ±-androstane-3Œ±, 17Œ≤-diol (3Œ±-diol). 3Œ±-diol is a neurosteroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAAR in the central nervous system (CNS). We examined the hypothesis that 3Œ±-diol-regulated pathological effects in the prostate are GABAAR-dependent, but are independent of the AR. In GABAAR-positive, AR-negative human PCa PC-3 cells, 3Œ±-diol significantly stimulated cell growth in culture and the in ovo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model. 3Œ±-diol also up-regulated expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors and activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and Src as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Inclusion of GABAAR antagonists reversed 3Œ±-diol-stimulated tumor cell growth, expression of EGF family members, and activation of EGFR and Src to the level observed in untreated cells. Results from the present study suggest that 3Œ±-diol may act as an alternative intra-prostatic neurosteroid that activates AR-independent PCa progression.

Methods:   We identified all men who underwent a robotic radical prostatectomy from April 1, 2014, to October 31, 2015, in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) with insurance from Medicare or a large commercial payer. We calculated rates of ""routine"" home care use after prostatectomy by urology practice. We defined ""routine"" home care as home care initiated within 4 days of discharge among patients discharged without a pelvic drain. We then compared emergency department (ED) visits, readmissions, prolonged catheter use, catheter reinsertion rates, and 90-day episode payments, in unadjusted and using a propensity-adjusted analysis, for those who did and did not receive home care.  Results:   We identified 647 patients, of whom 13% received routine home health care. At the practice level, the use of routine home care after prostatectomy varied from 0% to 53% (P = .05) (mean: 3.6%, median: 0%). Unadjusted, patients with routine home care had increased ED visits within 16 days (15.5% vs 6.9%, P <.01), similar rates of catheter duration for >16 days (3.6% vs 3.0%, P = .79) and need for catheter replacement (1.2% vs 2.5%, P = .46), and a trend toward decreased readmissions (0% vs 4.1%, P = .06). Only the increased ED visits remained significant in adjusted analyses (P <.01). Home health had an average payment of $1000 per episode.

There is a higher incidence of PCa for African Americans (AAs) than for European-Americans (EAs). Investigations related to the incidence of PCa-related health disparities for AAs suggest that there are differences in the genetic makeup of these populations. Other differences are environmentally induced (e.g., diet and lifestyle), and the exposures are different. Men who immigrate from Eastern to Western countries have a higher risk of PCa than men in their native countries. However, the number of immigrants developing PCa is still lower than that of men in Western countries, suggesting that genetic factors are involved in the development of PCa. Altered genetic polymorphisms are associated with PCa progression. Androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) are involved in the development and progression of PCa. For populations with diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, differences in lifestyle, diet, and biology, including genetic mutations/polymorphisms and levels of androgens and AR, are risk factors for PCa.

To our knowledge this has been studied in only 1 prior cohort.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens from an academic institution, including those from 3,291 men with Gleason score 6 and 4,202 with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (Grade Group 2) disease between 2005 and 2016. For dichotomous variables the Pearson chi-square test was used.  Results:   Of the 3,288 Gleason score 6 cancer cases 128 (3.9%) showed focal extraprostatic extension compared to 593 of the 4,202 (14.1%) with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (p <0.0001). Of the 3,288 Gleason score 6 cancer cases 79 (2.4%) showed nonfocal extraprostatic extension compared to 639 of the 4,202 (15.2%) with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (p <0.0001). The incidence of focal extraprostatic extension with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 with less than 5% Gleason pattern 4 was 129 of 1,147 cases (11.2%), which was between Gleason scores 6 and 3 + 4 = 7 with greater than 5% Gleason pattern 4. The incidence of nonfocal extraprostatic extension in Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 with less than 5% Gleason pattern 4 was 96 of 1,147 cases (8.4%), which was between Gleason scores 6 and 3 + 4 = 7 with greater than 5% Gleason pattern 4. One of the 3,290 Gleason score 6 cases (0.03%) showed seminal vesicle invasion compared to 93 of the 4,202 (2.2%) of Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (p <0.0001). A limitation of our study was its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   It is not rare for pure Gleason score 6 prostate cancer to locally extend out of the prostate 3.9% focally and 2.4% nonfocally. In extremely rare cases Gleason score 6 can be associated with seminal vesicle invasion and yet not lymph node metastases.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed a prospectively maintained, single institution database for patients who underwent fusion and systematic biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy in 2010 to 2016. Index lesion was defined as the lesion with largest diameter on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. In patients with a saturated index lesion transrectal fusion biopsy targets were obtained at 6 mm intervals along the long axis of the index lesion. In patients with a nonsaturated index lesion only 1 target was obtained from the lesion. Gleason 6, 7 and 8-10 were defined as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively.  Results:   Included in the study were 208 consecutive patients, including 86 with a saturated and 122 with a nonsaturated lesion. Median patient age was 62.0 years (IQR 10.0) and median prostate specific antigen was 7.1 ng/ml (IQR 8.0). The median number of biopsy cores per index lesion was higher in the saturated lesion group (4 vs 2, p <0.001). The risk category upgrade rate from systematic only, fusion only, and combined fusion and systematic biopsy results to prostatectomy was 40.9%, 23.6% and 13.8%, respectively. The risk category upgrade from combined fusion and systematic biopsy results was lower in the saturated than in the nonsaturated lesion group (7% vs 18%, p = 0.021). There was no difference in the upgrade rate based on systematic biopsy between the 2 groups. However, fusion biopsy results were significantly less upgraded in the saturated lesion group (Gleason upgrade 20.9% vs 36.9%, p = 0.014 and risk category upgrade 14% vs 30.3%, p = 0.006).  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that saturation of the index lesion significantly decreases the risk of upgrading on radical prostatectomy by minimizing the impact of tumor heterogeneity.""","""['Brian P Calio', 'Abhinav Sidana', 'Dordaneh Sugano', 'Sonia Gaur', 'Mahir Maruf', 'Amit L Jain', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Added Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Clinical Nomograms for Predicting Adverse Pathology in Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcriptome Wide Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy and Matching Surgical Specimens from High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: The Target Must Be Hit.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy-Are 2 Biopsy Cores per Magnetic Resonance Imaging Lesion Required?', 'Diagnosis and Pathologic Reporting of Prostate Cancer in the Era of MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Novel Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Deep Learning and Clinical Parameter Integration for the Prediction of Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'How many cores should be taken from each region of interest when performing a targeted transrectal prostate biopsy?', 'Intensive sampling of the umbra and penumbra improves clinically significant prostate cancer detection and reduces risk of grade group upgrading at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate imaging-reporting and data system version 2 has improved biopsy tumor grade accuracy: a single, tertiary institutional experience.', 'Determination of Whether Apex or Non-Apex Prostate Cancer Is the Best Candidate for the Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density to Predict Pathological Grade Group Upgrading and Upstaging after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI provides a measure of perfusion and permeability, the transfer constant Ktrans, which could be employed for such comparisons in patients.  Aim:   To test the hypothesis that different tumour types exhibit systematically different Ktrans.  Materials and methods:   DCE-MRI data were retrieved from 342 solid tumours in 230 patients. These data were from 18 previous studies, each of which had had a different analysis protocol. All data were reanalysed using a standardised workflow using an extended Tofts model. A model of the posterior density of median Ktrans was built assuming a log-normal distribution and fitting a simple Bayesian hierarchical model.  Results:   12 histological tumour types were included. In glioma, median Ktrans was 0.016min-1 and for non-glioma tumours, median Ktrans ranged from 0.10 (cervical) to 0.21min-1 (prostate metastatic to bone). The geometric mean (95% CI) across all the non-glioma tumours was 0.15 (0.05, 0.45)min-1. There was insufficient separation between the posterior densities to be able to predict the Ktrans value of a tumour given the tumour type, except that the median Ktrans for gliomas was below 0.05min-1 with 80% probability, and median Ktrans measurements for the remaining tumour types were between 0.05 and 0.4min-1 with 80% probability.  Conclusion:   With the exception of glioma, our hypothesis that different tumour types exhibit different Ktrans was not supported. Studies in which tumour permeability is believed to affect outcome should not simply seek tumour types thought to exhibit high permeability. Instead, Ktrans is an idiopathic parameter, and, where permeability is important, Ktrans should be measured in each tumour to personalise that treatment.""","""['Ross A Little', 'Herv√© Barjat', 'Jennifer I Hare', 'Mary Jenner', 'Yvonne Watson', 'Susan Cheung', 'Katherine Holliday', 'Weijuan Zhang', ""James P B O'Connor"", 'Simon T Barry', 'Sanyogitta Puri', 'Geoffrey J M Parker', 'John C Waterton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Dynamic contrast-enhanced and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MR imaging for glioma grading: Preliminary comparison of vessel compartment and permeability parameters using hotspot and histogram analysis.', 'Differentiating between Central Nervous System Lymphoma and High-grade Glioma Using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast and Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MR Imaging with Histogram Analysis.', 'Textural features of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI derived model-free and model-based parameter maps in glioma grading.', 'Assessment of blood-brain barrier disruption using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.

Prostate cancer cell line DU145 has been exposed acutely the pesticide aldrin. Individual Raman spectra coming from control and treated cell populations have been acquired. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) has been used to assess differences among treated and control samples and to identify spectral biomarkers associated with pollutant stress. Some preprocessing methodologies have been tested in order to improve the capability of discrimination between fingerprints. Partial least squares discriminant analysis results suggest that the best normalization-scaling preprocessing combination is provided by Euclidean normalization (EN)-SIMPLISMA-based scaling (SBS). SIMPLISMA-based scaling has been proposed as a scaling method focused on the classification objective, which enhances variables with high relative variation among samples.

However, the effects of PGE2 on non-transformed prostate epithelial cells are unknown, despite the fact that PGE2 overproduction has been found in benign hyperplastic prostates. In the present work we studied the effects of PGE2 in immortalized, non-malignant prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells and found that PGE2 increased cell proliferation, cell migration, and production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and activated in vitro angiogenesis. These actions involved a non-canonic intracrine mechanism in which the actual effector was intracellular PGE2 (iPGE2 ) instead of extracellular PGE2 : inhibition of the prostaglandin uptake transporter (PGT) or antagonism of EP receptors prevented the effects of PGE2 , which indicated that PGE2 activity depended on its carrier-mediated translocation from the outside to the inside of cells and that EP receptors located intracellularly (iEP) mediated the effects of PGE2 . iPGE2 acted through transactivation of epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) by iEP, leading to increased expression and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Œ± (HIF-1Œ±). Interestingly, iPGE2 also mediates the effects of PGE2 on prostate cancer PC3 cells through the axis iPGE2 -iEP receptors-EGFR-HIF-1Œ±. Thus, this axis might be responsible for the growth-stimulating effects of PGE2 on prostate epithelial cells, thereby contributing to prostate proliferative diseases associated with chronic inflammation. Since this PGT-dependent non-canonic intracrine mechanism of PGE2 action operates in both benign and malignant prostate epithelial cells, PGT inhibitors should be tested as a novel therapeutic modality to treat prostate proliferative disease.""","""['Antonio Madrigal-Mart√≠nez', 'Ana B Fern√°ndez-Mart√≠nez', 'Francisco J Lucio Caza√±a']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['PROSTAGLANDIN E2 stimulates cancer-related phenotypes in prostate cancer PC3 cells through cyclooxygenase-2.', 'Role of intracellular prostaglandin E‚ÇÇ in cancer-related phenotypes in PC3 cells.', 'Intracellular EP2 prostanoid receptor promotes cancer-related phenotypes in PC3 cells.', 'Targeting angiogenic pathways involving tumor-stromal interaction to treat advanced human prostate cancer.', 'Calcitriol and genistein actions to inhibit the prostaglandin pathway: potential combination therapy to treat prostate cancer.', 'Overview of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-Targeting Radiolabelled Imaging Probes from Preclinical Perspective: Lessons Learned and Road Ahead.', 'Cyclooxygenase inhibition attenuates brain angiogenesis and independently decreases mouse survival under hypoxia.', 'Prostaglandin E2 and Cancer: Insight into Tumor Progression and Immunity.']"""

Recently, we synthesized a novel bifunctional chelator (BFC) bearing hydroxamic acid arms (DOTHA2). Here we investigated the potential of a novel DOTHA2-conjugated, 64Cu-radiolabeled GRPR peptide antagonist, [D-Phe6-Sta13-Leu14-NH2]bombesin(6-14) (DOTHA2-PEG-RM26) to visualize prostate tumors by PET imaging.  Methods:   DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was conveniently and efficiently assembled on solid support. The compound was radiolabeled with 64Cu and its affinity, stability, cellular uptake on PC3 prostate cancer cells were evaluated. The in vitro and in vivo behavior of [64Cu]DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was examined by PET imaging using human PC3 prostate cancer xenografts and its behavior was compared to that of the analogous [64Cu]NOTA-PEG-RM26.  Results:   The inhibition constant of natCu-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was in the low nanomolar range (0.68¬±0.19 nM). The [64Cu]DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 conjugate was prepared with a labeling yield >95% and molar activity of 56¬±3 GBq/Œºmol after a 5-min room temperature labeling. [64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 demonstrated rapid blood and renal clearance as well as a high tumor uptake. Small animal PET images confirmed high and specific uptake in PC3 tumor. Both [64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 and [64Cu]-NOTA-PEG-RM26 displayed similar tumor and normal tissue uptakes at early time point post injection.  Conclusions:   [64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 allows visualization of prostate tumors by PET imaging. DOTHA2 enables fast 64Cu chelation under mild condition, and as such could be used advantageously for the development of other 64Cu-labeled peptide-derived PET tracers.""","""['Nematallah Mansour', 'Michel Paquette', 'Samia Ait-Mohand', 'V√©ronique Dumulon-Perreault', 'Brigitte Gu√©rin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Impact of dianionic and dicationic linkers on tumor uptake and biodistribution of 64 CuCu/NOTA peptide-based gastrin-releasing peptide receptors antagonists.', 'Selection of optimal chelator improves the contrast of GRPR imaging using bombesin analogue RM26.', 'Nuclear imaging of prostate cancer with gastrin-releasing-peptide-receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals.', 'An update of radiolabeled bombesin analogs for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeting.', 'Nanostrategies for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Targeting of Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor.', '64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA, a Novel PSMA PET Radiotracer for Prostate Cancer with a Long Imaging Time Window.', 'Advances in Development of Radiometal Labeled Amino Acid-Based Compounds for Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of the Copper-64 Labeled GRPR-Antagonist RM26 in Comparison with the Cobalt-55 Labeled Counterpart for PET-Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   All patients consecutively treated for PCa by RP in 6 academic institutions between August 2013 and July 2016 were included. MetS was defined as at least 3 of 5 components (obesity, elevated blood pressure, diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and hypertriglyceridemia).

Locally advanced disease was defined as a pT-stage ‚â•3. International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) groups were used for pathological grading. Qualitative and quantitative variables were compared using chi-square and Wilcoxon tests; logistic regression analyses assessed the association of MetS and its components with pathological data. Statistical significance was defined as a P<0.05.  Results:   Among 567 men, 249 (44%) had MetS.

We aimed at assessing the generalizability of the ProtecT trial to contemporary patients undergoing RP at two high-volume institutions. Overall, 29147 PCa patients treated with RP between 1999 and 2016 were included. We evaluated changes in disease characteristics over time. Competing-risk analyses estimated the 10-yr cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) rates. Overall, 20598 (71%) patients were eligible for the ProtecT trial, ranging from 76% in 1999-2005 to 67% in 2014-2016. The proportion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ‚â•20ng/ml, biopsy grade group 4-5, and high-risk disease increased over time (all p<0.001). Among men potentially eligible for the ProtecT trial included in our study, median PSA and grade group 4-5 were higher as compared with the ProtecT trial (6.5 vs 4.7ng/ml and 9% vs 2%), especially in individuals treated in more recent years (7.1ng/ml and 16% for 2014-2016). Median follow-up was 50 mo. When considering patients eligible for the ProtecT trial, the 10-yr OCM rate exceeded the CSM rate (7% vs 2%). Conversely, when focusing on patients not eligible due to disease aggressiveness, the risk of CSM exceeded that of OCM (10% vs 7%). Clinicians should carefully consider the inverse stage migration toward more aggressive disease among surgical candidates in more recent years. Individuals not eligible for the ProtecT trial are more likely to die from PCa than from OCM, thus being the optimal candidates for testing the role of primary treatments. PATIENT SUMMARY: Contemporary prostate cancer surgery candidates harbor more aggressive disease features at presentation as compared with men included in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial and are, in turn, at an increased risk of progression and mortality. Clinicians should take this into consideration when generalizing the results of the ProtecT trial with a particular emphasis on the oncologic safety of active monitoring in contemporary patients not included in structured prostate-specific antigen-based screening programs.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Derya Tilki', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Raisa S Pompe', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Markus Graefen', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Very long-term survival patterns of young patients treated with radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Specific Mortality Among Korean Men with Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy: A Multi-Center Study Using Propensity Scoring and Competing Risk Regression Analyses.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Is There an Optimal Curative Option in HIV-Positive Men with Localized Prostate Cancer?

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and newly diagnosed mPCa.  Materials methods:   All men diagnosed with PCa in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2013 were identified. Characteristics of men presenting with and without metastatic disease were compared. A 4-level composite metric of SES was created using Census-based income and education data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between SES, race/ethnicity, and insurance and the risk of presenting with mPCa at the time of diagnosis.  Results:   Of 1,034,754 patients diagnosed with PCa, 4% had mPCa at initial presentation.

It becomes significantly inactive (non-toxic) when derivatized at its N-2' secondary amine. This provides a strategy for targeting emetine to cancerous tumor without killing normal cells. In this report, PSA activatable peptide prodrugs of emetine were synthesized. To overcome steric hindrances and enhance protease specific cleavage, a 2-stage prodrug activation process was needed to release emetine in cancer cells. In this 2-stage process, emetine prodrug intermediates are coupled to PSA peptide substrate (Ac-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln) to obtain the full prodrug. Both prodrug intermediates 10 (Ala-Pro-PABC-Emetine) and 14 (Ser-Leu-PABC-Emetine) were evaluated for kinetics of hydrolysis to emetine and potency [Where PABC = p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl]. While both intermediates quantitatively liberate emetine when incubated under appropriate conditions, upon coupling of PSA substrate to give the full prodrugs, only prodrug 16, the prodrug obtained from 14 was hydrolyzable by PSA. Cytotoxicity studies in PSA producing LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 confirm the activation of the prodrug by PSA with an IC50 of 75 nM and 59 nM respectively. The cytotoxicity of 16 is significantly reduced in cell lines that do not produce PSA. Further, in vivo toxicity studies are done on these prodrugs and other derivatives of emetine.

The performances and efficacy of the biologically based gEUD (generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose) objective implemented in the Photon Optimizer (PO) of Varian Eclipse treatment planning system have been here analyzed. gEUD is associated with the parameter a that accounts for the seriality of a structure, being higher for more serial organs. The PO was used to optimize volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans on a virtual homogeneous cylindrical phantom presenting a target and an organ at risk (OAR). The OAR was placed at 4 mm, 1 and 2 cm distance, or cropped at 0, 2 and 4 mm from the target. Homogeneous target dose of 60 Gy in 20 fractions was requested with physical dose-volume objectives, while OAR dose was minimized with the upper gEUD objective. The gEUD specific a parameter was varied from 0.1 to 40 to assess its impact to OAR sparing and target coverage. Actual head and neck and prostate cases, with one parotid and the rectum as test OAR, were also analyzed to translate the results in the more complex clinical environment. Increasing the a parameter value in the gEUD objective, the optimization achieved lower volumes of the OAR which received the highest dose levels. The maximum dose in the OAR was minimized well with a values up to 20, while further increase of a to 40 did not further improve the result. The OAR mean dose was reduced for the OAR located at 1 and 2 cm distance from the target, enforced with increasing a. For cropped OARs, a mean dose reduction was achieved for a values up to 3-5, but mean dose increased for higher a values. The optimal choice of the parameter a depends on the mutual OAR and target position, and seriality of the organ.

Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome.  Results:   In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements.

The clinical and biological values of CPNE1 in prostate cancer are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological value of CPNE1 and the association of CPNE1 with TRAF2 expression in patients with prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS CPNE1 expression in prostate cancer was analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to investigate the association of CPNE1 expression with TRAF2 expression in prostate cancer. The association of CPNE1 expression with recurrence-free survival in patients was also analyzed using the TCGA dataset. Immunohistochemistry assay was performed to examine CPNE1 expression in 65 normal prostate samples and 114 prostate cancer samples. The recurrence-free survival in patients was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. In addition, multivariate and univariate analyses of prognostic factors were investigated by Cox regression. The effect of CPNE1 on TRAF2 expression was explored in human prostate cancer DU-145 cells. RESULTS Our results showed that expression level of CPNE1 is higher in prostate cancer than in normal prostate tissues (P=0.006). In the GSE35988 dataset, CPNE1 expression was found to be upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with non-castration-resistant prostate cancer (P<0.001). Furthermore, we found that CPNE1 high expression was significantly related to tumor stage, Gleason score, and poorer biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients. Co-expression analysis of TCGA data showed that CPNE1 is significantly associated with TRAF2 expression. CPNE1 overexpression can upregulate TRAF2 expression in prostate cancer DU-145 cells as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our findings suggest that CPNE1 is a valuable prognostic marker for evaluating recurrence-free survival and is positively related to TRAF2 expression in prostate cancer.""","""['Jiabei Liang', 'Jian Zhang', 'Jun Ruan', 'Yuanyuan Mi', 'Qiang Hu', 'Zhirong Wang', 'Bingbing Wei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Overexpression of Copines-1 is associated with clinicopathological parameters and poor outcome in gastric cancer.', 'TRAF2 is a Valuable Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Knockdown of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) modulates in vitro growth of TRAIL-treated prostate cancer cells.', 'Elevated levels of epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 predicts poor prognosis for prostate cancer.', 'Methylation status of TRAF2 is associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of prognostic value, immune implication and biological function of CPNE1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'CPNE1 regulates myogenesis through the PERK-eIF2Œ± pathway mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Overexpression of Copines-1 is associated with clinicopathological parameters and poor outcome in gastric cancer.', 'CPNE1 is a potential prognostic biomarker, associated with immune infiltrates and promotes progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The regulation of CPNE1 ubiquitination by the NEDD4L is involved in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

For the immunoassay of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which is a biomarker of prostate cancer, MWCNTs were activated with PSA antibody (monoclonal antibody of the prostate specific antigen) by using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (NHSS). The activated MWCNTs were deposited on the micro-pore filter paper to use as a biosensor. The prepared biosensor can assay from 0 to 500ng/mL of PSA level within 2h with the detection limit of 1.18ng/mL by the measurement of resistance change. The resistance change was caused by site selective interaction between PSA and PSA-antigen with an inexpensive bench top digital multimeter (5 1/2 digits). The detection range and sensitivity of the prepared sensor are good enough to diagnose the early stage of prostate cancer (> 4ng/mL of PSA). This paper-based biosensor is about 20 times cheaper (fabricated biosensor price: 2.4 $) and over 10 times faster than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is a general method for the detection of a specific protein in the modernized hospitals.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to determine the risk of cancer among elderly IBD patients compared with younger IBD patients. Additionally, the absolute risk of malignancy and factors contributing to it were evaluated, and therapeutic patterns among the elderly were assessed.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study extracted data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan¬Æ database. Among adult IBD patients who were free of cancer before starting on corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologics, a Cox model for time to cancer was fitted that adjusted for several covariates, including time-dependent treatment. Baseline results were evaluated by age group, as were the incidence of cancer and the distribution of cancer subtypes.  Results:   The elderly IBD cohort (n = 8788) had a higher prevalence of cancer and several other ailments before starting treatment, relative to the younger IBD cohort aged 18-64 years (n = 54,971). During follow-up, the elderly IBD cohort experienced a higher incidence of malignancy, confirmed by a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.71-3.41) from the Cox model fit. The risk of cancer was also significantly associated with male sex (HR 0.82 female), duration of disease (HR 1.08), several comorbidities and corticosteroid use (HR 1.35), but not with the use of immunomodulators or biologics.

Using a mixture model analysis, we identified distinct trajectories of post-treatment PSA measurements and evaluated their associations with prostate cancer mortality. The study sample included 623 US Veterans treated for prostate cancer with curative intent during 1991-1995; 225 men received surgery and 398 men received radiation therapy. Post-treatment PSA measurements over a 2-year period for each patient were evaluated in latent class mixture models using the SAS TRAJ procedure, and groups of men with distinct trajectories of PSA were identified. These groups were then assessed for associations with 10-year prostate cancer mortality using proportional hazards analysis. Analyses identified three distinct groups-representing patterns of both initial values and changes in PSA over time-after surgery (n=172/31/14) and radiation therapy (n=253/103/22). Men in groups with patterns of higher (compared with the group with lowest) PSA values tended to have worse survival experience: HRs for prostate cancer mortality were 3.45 (P=0.18) and 22.7 (P<0.001) for surgery, and 2.70 (P=0.005) and 18.1 (P<0.001) for radiation therapy. The results indicate that PSA measurements after surgery or radiation therapy with curative intent include groups of men with a diverse spectrum of prognosis for prostate cancer mortality.

Methods and materials:   The prostate gland was contoured on 157 MRI scans from 52 prostate cancer patients undergoing brachytherapy. The curvature of the posterior prostate surface deformation was computed as a measure of prostate distortion and compared between scans with a BTC, rigid endorectal coil (REC), or no endorectal coil. For the nine patients who had MRIs with all three endorectal scenarios, a mean prostate deformation vector was also calculated between scenarios using deformable image registration. These measures of prostate distortion were compared with the prostate anterior-to-posterior to left-to-right ratio (AP/LR) on the largest prostate axial slice.  Results:   Significant differences in prostate curvature were found between scans without an endorectal coil versus a REC versus a BTC (p < 0.001). The mean prostate deformation was 3.9 mm due to the BTC and 2.0 mm for the REC (p = 0.012). The mean AP/LR ratio was 0.62 with a BTC versus 0.76 without a coil or 0.73 with a REC (p < 0.001), but no difference existed between scans with a REC versus no coil (p = 0.7). The AP/LR ratio showed moderate correlation with prostate curvature (r = 0.48), and with mean prostate deformation (r = -0.64 to 0.68).  Conclusions:   The REC caused minimal deformation of the prostate compared with a BTC with adequate MR image quality, and calculation of the cross-sectional AP/LR ratio on the largest axial prostate slice can serve as a simple measure of prostate distortion.""","""['Geoffrey V Martin', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Steven J Frank', 'Jihong Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Development of multiorgan finite element-based prostate deformation model enabling registration of endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging for radiotherapy planning.', 'Expandable and rigid endorectal coils for prostate MRI: impact on prostate distortion and rigid image registration.', 'Parallel imaging compressed sensing for accelerated imaging and improved signal-to-noise ratio in MRI-based postimplant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance tomography with endorectal coil for examination of prostate and seminal vesicles.', 'Prostate MRI: Is Endorectal Coil Necessary?-A Review.', 'Prostate MRI using a rigid two-channel phased-array endorectal coil: comparison with phased array coil acquisition at 3\u2009T.', 'Radiomic and Genomic Machine Learning Method Performance for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Systematic Literature Review.', 'Spatial and dosimetric evaluation of residual distortions of prostate and seminal vesicle bed after image-guided definitive and postoperative radiotherapy of prostate cancer with endorectal balloon.', 'Quality Comparison of 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI of the prostate using a flexible surface receiver coil versus conventional surface coil plus endorectal coil setup.']"""

Methods:   A Markov cohort model was developed using clinical pathways from US prostate cancer guidelines and clinical expertise. Estimates of the probabilities of various treatments and outcomes and their unit costs were sourced from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, epidemiological publications and national cost reports. Estimated costs by stage of disease, by major treatments and by age at diagnosis were reported in 2016 US dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed potential variation in the modeled costs.  Results:   Australia-wide costs of prostate cancer were estimated at US$270.9 million in 2016 rising to US$384.3 million in 2025, an expected increase of 42%. Of this total increase, newly diagnosed low risk cases will contribute US$32.9 million, intermediate-risk US$56.8 million, high-risk US$53.3 million and advanced US$12.6 million. For men diagnosed at age 65 with low-risk disease, lifetime costs per patient were US$14,497 for surgery, US$19,665 for radiation therapies to the primary lesion, and US$9,234 for active surveillance. For intermediate- or high-risk disease, mean costs per patient were US$34,941 for surgery plus radiation and US$31,790 for androgen deprivation therapy plus radiation while advanced cancer therapies were at US$31,574 per patient. Additional costs for managing iatrogenic disease secondary to these treatments were excluded.  Conclusion:   Strategies for identifying patients early before cancers have spread are critical to contain the estimated 42% increase in costs over the next decade. Increased uptake of active surveillance would also lead to substantial cost-savings in the management of low-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Louisa G Gordon', 'Haitham W Tuffaha', 'Robbie James', 'Andrew T Keller', 'Anthony Lowe', 'Paul A Scuffham', 'Robert A Gardiner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Total Medicare Costs Associated With Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer in Elderly Men.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of multiparametric MRI with increased active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer in Australia.', 'The economics of active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Active Surveillance Strategies for Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Economic analysis of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.', 'Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review.', 'Responsiveness and construct validity of EPIC-26, AQoL-6D and SF-6D following treatment in prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of the financial impact and efficiency of the One Stop Prostate Clinic: A same day prostate cancer diagnostic clinic in the Australian public health system.', 'Navigate: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of an online treatment decision aid for men with low-risk prostate cancer and their partners.', 'Clinical impact of PSMA PET/CT in primary prostate cancer compared to conventional nodal and distant staging: a retrospective single center study.']"""

Methods:   A cross-sectional quantitative study with an analytic design was carried out in a randomly selected sample of 155 adult men aged 25-98 years living in a rural community in Kenya. Constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour were used to guide this study. A 5 -point Likert scale was used to assess fatalistic beliefs, fear, perceived benefits, and family influence. A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data at the household level.  Results:   Only 2.4% of the study participants had been screened for prostate cancer. About 2/3rd (64%) of the participants felt that they were at risk of getting prostate cancer; 44% intended to be screened within the following 6 months. Mean scores on a 5-point Likert scale indicated: strong beliefs in the benefits of prostate screening (4.2 (¬±SD .8), men aged over 40 were not perceived to be at risk of getting prostate cancer (1.3 ¬± .6), relatively high fatalistic beliefs of prostate cancer screening (3.6 (¬±SD .8), high degree of fear or apprehension of prostate cancer screening (3.2 (¬±SD 1.2), and a high level of influence of family members in prostate cancer screening (3.9 (¬±SD 1.0). The Wald criterion demonstrated that only family influence made a significant contribution to the intent to screen for prostate cancer (p = 0.031). Age, education, marital status, fatalism, fear, and benefit of screening were not associated with the intent to screen for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Strong beliefs of the benefits of prostate screening tended to be surpassed by relatively high fatalistic beliefs and fear or apprehension in prostate cancer screening.

Fourteen patients were administered with 3 MBq/kg of 18F-fluorocholine and scanned dynamically for 30 minutes. Positron emission tomography images were divided to early and late time points (1-6 minutes summed and 7-30 minutes summed). The values of the different SUVs were documented for dominant PET-avid lesions, and metabolic tumor volume was estimated using a 50% isocontour and SUV threshold of 2.5. Image quality was assessed via visual acuity scoring (VAS). We found that incorporation of TOF or RIR increased lesion SUVs. The lesion to background ratio was not improved by TOF reconstruction, while RIR improved the lesion to background ratio significantly ( P < .05).

We propose and examine a design that takes particular advantage of recent advances in the understanding of both Convolutional Neural Networks as well as ResNets. Our approach focuses upon the importance of a trainable pre-processing when using FC-ResNets and we show that a low-capacity FCN model can serve as a pre-processor to normalize medical input data. In our image segmentation pipeline, we use FCNs to obtain normalized images, which are then iteratively refined by means of a FC-ResNet to generate a segmentation prediction. As in other fully convolutional approaches, our pipeline can be used off-the-shelf on different image modalities. We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to other 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver lesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying our 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we reach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods.

Furthermore, it is an olfactory receptor with a known chemically near identic antagonist/agonist pair, Œ±- and Œ≤-ionone. Using a combined theoretical and experimental approach, we propose that this receptor is activated by a ligand-induced rearrangement of a protein-internal hydrogen bond network. Surprisingly, this rearrangement is not induced by interaction of the ligand with the network, but by dynamic van der Waals contacts of the ligand with the involved amino acid side chains, altering their conformations and intraprotein connectivity. Ligand recognition in this GPCR is therefore highly stereo selective, but seemingly lacks any ligand recognition via polar contacts. A putative olfactory receptor-based drug design scheme will have to take this unique mode of protein/ligand action into account.""","""['Steffen Wolf', 'Nikolina Jovancevic', 'Lian Gelis', 'Sebastian Pietsch', 'Hanns Hatt', 'Klaus Gerwert']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['PSGR, a novel prostate-specific gene with homology to a G protein-coupled receptor, is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'Exchanging ligand-binding specificity between a pair of mouse olfactory receptor paralogs reveals odorant recognition principles.', 'Agonist-induced conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin: insight into activation of G-protein-coupled receptors.', 'Molecular Basis of Mammalian Odor Discrimination: A Status Report.', 'Relaxin-3, INSL5, and their receptors.', 'Machine Learning-Based Modeling of Olfactory Receptors in Their Inactive State: Human OR51E2 as a Case Study.', 'Tensiometry as a Simple Analytical Method for Quantification of Solubility and Release of Aroma Molecules in Aqueous Media.', 'Machine Learning Assisted Approach for Finding Novel High Activity Agonists of Human Ectopic Olfactory Receptors.', 'A two-stage computational approach to predict novel ligands for a chemosensory receptor.', 'BIO-GATS: A Tool for Automated GPCR Template Selection Through a Biophysical Approach for Homology Modeling.']"""

Few studies, however, have investigated etiologic differences by TMPRSS2:ERG status. Because the fusion is hormone-regulated and a man's hormonal milieu varies by height and obesity status, we hypothesized that both may be differentially associated with risk of TMPRSS2:ERG-defined disease.Methods: Our study included 49,372 men from the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants reported height and weight at baseline in 1986 and updated weight biennially thereafter through 2009. Tumor ERG protein expression (a TMPRSS2:ERG marker) was immunohistochemically assessed. We used multivariable competing risks models to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of ERG-positive and ERG-negative prostate cancer.Results: During 23 years of follow-up, we identified 5,847 incident prostate cancers, among which 913 were ERG-assayed. Taller height was associated with an increased risk of ERG-positive disease only [per 5 inches HR 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.50; Pheterogeneity = 0.07]. Higher body mass index (BMI) at baseline (per 5 kg/m2 HR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.91; Pheterogeneity = 0.02) and updated BMI over time (per 5 kg/m2 HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00; Pheterogeneity = 0.07) were associated with a reduced risk of ERG-positive disease only.Conclusions: Our results indicate that anthropometrics may be uniquely associated with TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer; taller height may be associated with greater risk, whereas obesity may be associated with lower risk.Impact: Our study provides strong rationale for further investigations of other prostate cancer risk factors that may be distinctly associated with subtypes.

However, signaling pathways driving aberrant IAS remain poorly understood.Experimental Design: The effect of components of the AKT-RUNX2-osteocalcin (OCN)-GPRC6A-CREB signaling axis on expression of steroidogenesis genes CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 and testosterone level were examined in PTEN-null human prostate cancer cell lines. Pten knockout mice were used to examine the effect of Runx2 heterozygous deletion or abiraterone acetate (ABA), a prodrug of the CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone on Cyp11a1 and Cyp17a1 expression, testosterone level and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling in vivoResults: We uncovered that activation of the AKT-RUNX2-OCN-GPRC6A-CREB signaling axis induced expression of CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 and testosterone production in PTEN-null prostate cancer cell lines in culture. Deletion of Runx2 in Pten homozygous knockout prostate tumors decreased Cyp11a1 and Cyp17a1 expression, testosterone level, and tumor growth in castrated mice. ABA treatment also inhibited testosterone synthesis and alleviated Pten loss-induced tumorigenesis in vivoPten deletion induced TME remodeling, but Runx2 heterozygous deletion or ABA treatment reversed the effect of Pten loss by decreasing expression of the collagenase Mmp9.Conclusions: Abnormal RUNX2 activation plays a pivotal role in PTEN loss-induced IAS and TME remodeling, suggesting that the identified signaling cascade represents a viable target for effective treatment of PTEN-null prostate cancer, including CRPC.

Determine whether the addition of ultrafast DCE-MRI improves the performance of multiparametric MRI.  Materials and methods:   Patients (n = 20) with pathologically confirmed PCa underwent preoperative 3T MRI with T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and high temporal resolution (~2.2 seconds) DCE-MRI using gadoterate meglumine (Guerbet, Bloomington, IN) without an endorectal coil. DCE-MRI data were analyzed by fitting signal intensity with an empirical mathematical model to obtain parameters: percent signal enhancement, enhancement rate (Œ±), washout rate (Œ≤), initial enhancement slope, and enhancement start time along with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 values. Regions of interests were placed on sites of prostatectomy verified malignancy (n = 46) and normal tissue (n = 71) from different zones.  Results:   Cancer (Œ± = 6.45 ¬± 4.71 s-1, Œ≤ = 0.067 ¬± 0.042 s-1, slope = 3.78 ¬± 1.90 s-1) showed significantly (P <.05) faster signal enhancement and washout rates than normal tissue (Œ± = 3.0 ¬± 2.1 s-1, Œ≤ = 0.034 ¬± 0.050 s-1, slope = 1.9 ¬± 1.4 s-1), but showed similar percentage signal enhancement and enhancement start time. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed area under the curve for DCE parameters was comparable to ADC and T2 in the peripheral (DCE 0.67-0.82, ADC 0.80, T2 0.89) and transition zones (DCE 0.61-0.72, ADC 0.69, T2 0.75), but higher in the central zone (DCE 0.79-0.88, ADC 0.45, T2 0.45) and anterior fibromuscular stroma (DCE 0.86-0.89, ADC 0.35, T2 0.12). Importantly, combining DCE with ADC and T2 increased area under the curve by ~30%, further improving the diagnostic accuracy of PCa detection.  Conclusion:   Quantitative parameters from empirical mathematical model fits to ultrafast DCE-MRI improve diagnosis of PCa. DCE-MRI with higher temporal resolution may capture clinically useful information for PCa diagnosis that would be missed by low temporal resolution DCE-MRI.

The problems of poor selectivity and severe side effects of the available anticancer drugs, have demanded the need for the development of safer and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. The present study was aimed at determining the cytotoxicities of 31 medicinal plants extracts, used in Nigerian ethnomedicine for the treatment of cancer.  Methods:   The plant extracts were screened for cytotoxicity, using the brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and MTT cytotoxicity assay. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell line, normal Vero cell line and the normal prostate (PNT2) cell line were used for the MTT assay, while Artemia salina nauplii was used for the BSLA. The phytochemical composition of the active plant extracts was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.  Results:   The extract of Eluesine indica (L.) Gaertn (Poaceae), with a LC50 value of 76.3 Œºg/mL, had the highest cytotoxicity on the brine shrimp larvae compared to cyclophosphamide (LC50 = 101.3 Œºg/mL). Two plants extracts, Macaranga barteri Mull. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae) and Calliandra portoricensis (Jacq.) Benth (Leguminosae) exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the RD cell line and had comparable lethal activity on the brine shrimps. Further cytotoxic investigation showed that the dichloromethane fraction of Macaranga barteri (DMB) and the ethyl acetate fraction of Calliandra portoricensis (ECP), exhibited approximately 6-fold and 4-fold activity, respectively, compared to cyclophosphamide on RD cell line. Determination of selective index (SI) using Vero and PNT2 cell line indicated that DMB and ECP displayed a high degree of selectivity against the cancer cell under investigation. HPLC analysis showed that 3,5dicaffeoylquinic acid, acteoside, kampferol-7-O-glucoside and bastadin 11 were the major components of DMB while the major components of ECP were neurolenin B, nigrosporolide and trans-geranic acid.

Prostate cancer patients may be approached to give their consent for biobanking at any point in their treatment pathway, which allows residual material from their earlier diagnosis to be transferred and used by the Biobank. Currently, patients are specifically asked to donate samples of blood and surplus prostate tissue as well as permitting access to their clinical and pathological data that continues to be added throughout the course of their disease. Between 2013 and 2015, 549 prostate cancer patients gave their consent to the biobank and, the tissue repository collected 489 blood samples, 120 frozen prostate tissue samples and 1064 formalin fixed paraffin embedded diagnostic blocks.Prostate cancer has become a chronic disease in a large proportion of men, with many men receiving multiple subsequent treatments, and their treatment trajectory often spanning over decades. Therefore, this resource aims to provide an ideal research platform to explore potential variations in treatment response as well as disease markers in the different risk categories for prostate cancer.A recent audit of the KHP PCaBB revealed that between 2013 and 2015, 1796 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer at King's Health Partners (KHP), out of which 549 (30.6%) gave their consent to KHP PCaBB. Comparisons between demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who had consented compared to the total patient population revealed that the KHP PCaBB is demographically representative of the total prostate cancer patient population seen in Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT). We observed no differences in distribution of ethnicity (p = 0.507) and socioeconomic status (p = 0.097). Some differences were observed in clinical characteristics, specifically with treatment type - which differed significantly between the patients who had given consent and total patient population.The KHP PCaBB has thereby amassed a rich data and tissue repository that is largely reflective of both the demographic and clinical diversity within the total prostate cancer patient population seen at KHP, making it an ideal platform for prostate cancer research.""","""['S R Saifuddin', 'W Devlies', 'A Santaolalla', 'F Cahill', 'G George', 'D Enting', 'S Rudman', 'P Cathcart', 'B Challacombe', 'P Dasgupta', 'C Galustian', 'A Chandra', 'S Chowdhury', 'C Gillett', 'M Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""[""Cohort profile: King's Health Partners bladder cancer biobank."", ""The Infectious Diseases BioBank at King's College London: archiving samples from patients infected with HIV to facilitate translational research."", 'The cooperative prostate cancer tissue resource: a specimen and data resource for cancer researchers.', 'Modelling, evaluating and implementing cost-effective services to reduce the impact of stroke.', 'Prostate cancer biobanking.', 'Standard operating procedures for biobank in oncology.', 'Invadopodia play a role in prostate cancer progression.', 'The Xiangya Ocular Tumor Bank: A Disease-Specific Biobank for Advancing Translational Research Into Ocular Tumors.', ""Guy's cancer cohort - real world evidence for cancer pathways."", 'Engineering Prostate Cancer from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-New Opportunities to Develop Preclinical Tools in Prostate and Prostate Cancer Studies.']"""

Methods:   Data from 45 CRPC patients treated with Ra were retrospectively analyzed. All patients who received at least one Ra injection were included in the study. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratio's (HR) and to test for association.  Results:   Twenty-one patients (47%) received six Ra injections and 24 patients (53%) received one to five Ra injections. Median OS since start of Ra was 13.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2-17.8). Patients who completed Ra therapy had a median OS of 19.7 months (95% CI 14.9-24.6), while patients who received one to five Ra injections had a median OS of 5.9 months (95% CI 3.8-8.1; P < 0.001).Univariable analysis showed poor baseline ECOG performance status (PS), baseline opioid use, lowered baseline hemoglobin, and elevated prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels were significantly associated with OS. Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that poor baseline ECOG PS (HR 10.6) and high LD levels (HR 7.7) were pre-therapeutic variables that predicted poor OS.  Conclusions:   In a multivariable Cox regression model, good baseline ECOG PS and low LD levels were significantly associated with longer OS in patients treated with Ra.

Therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is crucial for correct patient management. Unfortunately, currently available diagnostic methods cannot robustly identify premalignant and malignant pancreatic cystic lesions. Methods Cyst fluid samples obtained by routine endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration were used for the analyses. In a cohort of 24 patients, eight biomarker candidates for malignant potential and high-grade dysplasia/cancer were identified by an explorative proteomic approach. Subsequently, a quantitative analysis, using 30 heavy-labeled peptides from the biomarkers and parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, was devised, tested in a training cohort of 80, and prospectively evaluated in a validation cohort of 68 patients. End points were surgical pathology diagnosis/clinical follow-up. Diagnostic assessments were blinded to mass spectrometry results. Results The optimal set of markers for detecting malignant potential was a panel of peptides from mucin-5AC and mucin-2, which could discriminate premalignant/malignant lesions from benign with an accuracy of 97% (95% CI, 89% to 99%) in the validation cohort. This result compared favorably with the accuracy of standard analyses: cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (61%; 95% CI, 46% to 74%; P < .001) and cytology (84%; 95% CI, 71% to 92%; P = .02). A combination of proteins mucin-5AC and prostate stem-cell antigen could identify high-grade dysplasia/cancer with an accuracy of 96% (95% CI, 90% to 99%), and detected 95% of malignant/severely dysplastic lesions, compared with 35% and 50% for carcinoembryonic antigen and cytology ( P < .001 and P = .003, respectively). Conclusion Targeted mass spectrometry analysis of just three cyst fluid biomarkers provides highly accurate identification and assessment of cystic precursors to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additional studies should determine whether the method can facilitate timely cancer diagnosis, successful intervention, and prevention.""","""['Karolina S Jabbar', 'Liisa Arike', 'Caroline S Verbeke', 'Riadh Sadik', 'Gunnar C Hansson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Pancreatic cancer: Mass spectrometry indicates malignant potential.', 'Proteomic mucin profiling for the identification of cystic precursors of pancreatic cancer.', 'Accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology on the differentiation of malignant and benign pancreatic cystic lesions: a single-center experience.', 'Simple mucinous cyst: another potential cancer precursor in the pancreas?

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 605 patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) and long-term ADT (National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria-defined intermediate-risk, minimum 10 months; high-risk and very-high-risk, minimum 20 months) was performed. The median ADT time was 31 months. Cox's proportional hazards models were used to compare biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS), clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS) and overall survival (OS) between the ‚â•70, <78 Gy group and 78 Gy group in a univariate analysis and to assess the effects of the dose escalation on bDFS in a multivariate analysis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 70 months, 5-year bDFS was significantly better in the 78 Gy group than in the ‚â•70, <78 Gy group [96 vs 83%; hazard ratio 3.6 (95% confidence interval 2.2-6.1); p < 0.001]. 5-year cRFS and OS were similar between the two groups. The multivariate analysis showed that RT dose was still an independent prognostic factor of bDFS (p = 0.005).  Conclusion:   The results of the present study suggest that dose escalations result in significant improvements in bDFS, even when used in combination with long-term ADT. A longer follow-up is needed to clarify the effects of dose escalations on cRFS and OS.

Under certain assumptions, Mendelian randomization analysis of a genetic marker for an exposure eliminates reverse causation and confounding.  Methods:   We applied Mendelian randomization analysis to genetic scores, comprising 26-41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as instrumental variables (IVs) for triglycerides and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC, HDLC), using a prospective cohort of 26 904 individuals in which there were 6607 incident cancers. We also investigated cancer risk for a SNP (rs12916) in the gene encoding hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the targeted enzyme in statin treatment. We used logistic regression and SNP pleiotropy-adjusted analyses to estimate the odds ratio per standard deviation (OR).  Results:   The OR for the triglyceride IV as a predictor of any cancer was 0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-1.03] unadjusted, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78-0.95) from the pleiotropy-adjusted analysis. For the HMGCR rs12916 per LDLC-lowering T-allele, the OR was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01-1.18) for prostate cancer and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82-0.96) for breast cancer. The LDLC IV was not associated with prostate cancer or breast cancer. There were no associations between IVs and cancers of the lung, colon or bladder.  Conclusions:   Under the assumptions of Mendelian randomization, there is a causal and negative association between serum triglycerides and risk of any cancer. Further, the HMGCR genetic variant might be associated with risks of prostate and breast cancers but the biological mechanisms behind these findings are unclear, as the LDLC IV was not associated with these cancers.""","""['Marju Orho-Melander', 'George Hindy', 'Signe Borgquist', 'Christina-Alexandra Schulz', 'Jonas Manjer', 'Olle Melander', 'Tanja Stocks']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Epidemiol""","""['Body mass index and the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as predicted by HMGCR genetic variants and breast cancer risk.', 'Blood lipids and prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization analysis.', 'Effect of naturally random allocation to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on the risk of coronary heart disease mediated by polymorphisms in NPC1L1, HMGCR, or both: a 2 √ó 2 factorial Mendelian randomization study.', 'Mendelian Randomization Study of ACLY and Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Mendelian Randomization: A Review of Methods for the Prevention, Assessment, and Discussion of Pleiotropy in Studies Using the Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Gene as an Instrument for Adiposity.', 'Cholesterol and breast cancer risk: a cohort study using health insurance claims and health checkup databases.', 'Role of Serum Lipids, Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure in Breast Cancer Risk for Women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.', 'Correlations between serum lipid and Ki-67 levels in different breast cancer molecular subcategories.', 'Association between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation study.', 'Preoperative Serum Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio Can Predict Prognosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

In the back-projection method, the measured signal at each gantry angle is back-projected through the patient CT scan to give a measure of total dose to the patient. This study aims to investigate the practical agreement between the two types of EPID dosimetry for prostate radiotherapy. The AutoBeam treatment planning system produced VMAT plans together with corresponding predicted portal images, and a total of 46 sets of gantry-resolved portal images were acquired in 13 patients using an iViewGT portal imager. For the forward-projection method, each acquisition of gantry-resolved images was combined into a single integrated image and compared with the predicted image. For the back-projection method, iViewDose was used to calculate the dose distribution in the patient for comparison with the planned dose. A gamma index for 3% and 3 mm was used for both methods. The results were investigated by delivering the same plans to a phantom and repeating some of the deliveries with deliberately introduced errors. The strongest agreement between forward- and back-projection methods is seen in the isocentric intensity/dose difference, with moderate agreement in the mean gamma. The strongest correlation is observed within a given patient, with less correlation between patients, the latter representing the accuracy of prediction of the two methods. The error study shows that each of the two methods has its own distinct sensitivity to errors, but that overall the response is similar. The forward- and back-projection EPID dosimetry methods show moderate agreement in this series of prostate VMAT patients, indicating that both methods can contribute to the verification of dose delivered to the patient.""","""['James L Bedford', 'Ian M Hanson', 'Vibeke N Hansen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'An in vivo dose verification method for SBRT-VMAT delivery using the EPID.', 'In aqua vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'IPEM topical report: results of a 2020 UK survey on the use of online treatment monitoring solutions for IMRT/VMAT.', 'Comparing treatment uncertainty for ultra- vs. standard-hypofractionated breast radiation therapy based on in-vivo dosimetry.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', ""Art of publication: A beginner's guide to understanding the non-linear dynamics between research and publication."", 'Optimisation of a composite difference metric for prompt error detection in real-time portal dosimetry of simulated volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'In vivo dosimetry in external beam photon radiotherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.']"""

Methods:   To determine if telomere shortening, which has been associated with poor outcomes, may be a potential underlying mechanism, we prospectively evaluated the association between smoking status and telomere length in 567 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, who were surgically treated for prostate cancer. Using tissue microarrays (TMA), we measured telomere length in cancer and benign tissue, specifically stromal cells in the same TMA spot using a telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. Smoking status was collected via questionnaire 2-years before diagnosis. Adjusting for age, pathologic stage and grade, the median and standard deviation of the per-cell telomere signals were determined for each man for stromal cells and cancer cells by smoking categories. In sub-analyses, we restricted to men without major co-morbidities diagnosed before prostate cancer.  Results:   Overall, there were no associations between smoking status and telomere length or variability in stromal cells or cancer cells. However, among men without comorbidities, current smokers and former smokers who quit <10 years ago had the most variable telomere length in stromal cells (29.3% more variable than never smokers; P-trend = 0.0005) and in cancer cells (27.7% more variable than never smokers; P-trend = 0.05).

Functions of Cap in prostate cancer are not clear. We investigate effects of Cap on downregulation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) via modulation of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate carcinoma cells.  Methods:   Cell proliferation was measured by water-soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) cell proliferation assays. The PSA and AR expressions were assessed by immunoblotting and RT-qPCR assays. Effects of Cap on PSA expressions were determined by ELISA, immunoblotting, and reporter assays. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays were used to define the effects of Cap on dissociation of AR-heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) interaction.  Results:   Cap inhibited LNCaP cell growth in a dose- and/or time-dependent way without inducing poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Cap not only effectively suppressed AR and PSA protein expressions, but also attenuated activations of synthetic androgen (R1881) on PSA promoter activity dose- and time-dependently. The Cap pretreatment abrogated effects of R1881 on AR activity by reducing AR translocation to the nucleus. Immunoblotting assays indicated that Cap promoted a degradation of AR proteins dose-dependently in either cycloheximide pretreated-LNCaP cells or AR-ectopic expressed PC-3 cells. Pretreatment of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, attenuated effect of Cap on AR degradation. Cap lessened AR stability by dissociation of AR-Hsp90 interaction.

Two recent studies suggested that miR-564 plays a role in tumor inhibition in both lung and breast cancer. However, no evidence reported the mechanism and function of miR-564 in prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients and methods:   The PCa tissues and their adjacent normal tissues were collected from 50 PCa patients. Expressions of miR-564 in tissues and cells were evaluated with RT-qPCR. The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay, Ô¨Çow cytometry and Western-blot analysis, were applied to detect the proliferation, cell cycle progression and the protein expression of PCa cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145). Migration and invasion of PCa cells were analyzed by Transwell assays. Furthermore, the correlation between miR-564 and MLLT3 was assessed by luciferase reporter assay. Also, the PCa cells were transfected with miR-564 mimics control and inhibitor.  Results:   In our present research, miR-564 was found dysregulated in PCa cells and to act as a suppressor in PCa cell proliferation, progression of cell cycle, cell invasion and migration. MLLT3 (also known as Af9) is a proto-oncogene, which has first reported in leukemia, and the regulation of its expression remains incompletely elucidated.

During the metastasis processes, cancer cells acquire a migratory and invasive phenotype. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in multiple processes of prostate cancer development including migration, chemoresistance, and carcinogenesis.  Patients and methods:   Expressions of miR-181a in prostate tumor samples and cancer cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Epithelial or mesenchymal markers were detected by Western blot. Nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 was measured by immunostaining of prostate cancer cells.  Results:   In this study, we report an oncogenic role of microRNA-181a in prostate cancer cells and patients. MiR-181a is upregulated in metastatic prostate tumor samples compared with primary prostate tumors. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of miR-181a promotes prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, we observed that overexpression of miR-181a contributes to an epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenotype in prostate cancer cells: the epithelial marker, E-cadherin was downregulated, and mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin, vimentin, and snail were upregulated. Consistently, the phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 and the nuclear localization of Smad 2/3 were increased by miR-181a expression. We identified that TGIF2 - a repressor of the Smad pathway - is a direct target of miR-181a in prostate cancer cells. Importantly, restoration of TGIF2 in miR-181a overexpressing prostate cancer cells inhibited the Smad pathway and EMT processes.

Methods:   Patients were evaluated in a prospectively-collected PC family database: The focus was on hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) defined by Johns Hopkins criteria and sporadic prostate cancer (SPC), rigorously defined by absence of prostate cancer in ‚â• 2 brothers aged ‚â• 60 years. Additionally, patients with first-degree (FPC) and non-first-degree PC (non-FPC) were assessed. Endpoints were biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS). Finally, clinico-pathological characteristics were compared and multiple proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors.  Results:   In total 11,654 patients were included (807 HPC, 2251 FPC, 8072 non-FPC and 524 SPC). Familial imposition (HPC/FPC) was associated with a younger age at diagnosis. Thus, HPC patients were diagnosed 2.9 years earlier than SPC patients with more locally advanced tumors (‚â• pT3). With a median follow up of 6.2 years (range 0-31.5) BRFS was significantly different when stratified by FH. In pairwise analyses BRFS differed significantly for HPC compared to SPC (HR = 1.27). Consecutively FH was identified as prognostic factor for BRFS (p = 0.021) together with age, PSA, pathologic characteristics and adjuvant androgen deprivation. Analyses of CSS did not show a difference.  Conclusion:   Patients with FH of PC are likely to be diagnosed earlier and present a higher proportion of locally advanced disease.

However, little is known about the transcriptional basis of cellular interactions in the human PC microenvironment. To clarify the mechanism of PC progression and metastasis, we investigated the interaction of PC, epithelial, and stromal cells using genome-wide gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that PC cells could induce stromal cells to differentiate into so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which might contribute to cancer invasion and metastasis. Genes upregulated in normal human prostate stromal cells (PrSC) co-cultured with human PC cells (LNCaP) included the mevalonate pathway enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Knockdown of endogenous HMGCS1 or HMGCR in PC cells by shRNA resulted in a significant reduction of PC cell viability. Importantly, exogenous overexpression of HMGCS1 or HMGCR in either PC cells or prostate stromal cells stimulated PC cell growth, suggesting a possible autocrine/paracrine mechanism of action. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that HMGCS1 and HMGCR were overexpressed in PC stroma, especially in early stage PC.

As prostate-specific antigen testing declines nationally, detailed assessment of current age- and race-specific incidence trends and quantitative forecasts are needed.  Objective:   To evaluate the current trends of metastatic PCA by age and race, and forecast the number of new cases (annual burden) and future trends.  Design, setting, and participants:   We derived incidence data for men aged ‚â•45 yr who were diagnosed with metastatic PCA from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We examined the current trends of metastatic PCA from 2004 to 2014, and forecast the annual burden and incidence rates by age and race for 2015-2025, using age-period-cohort models and population projections. We also examined alternative forecasts (2012-2025) using trends prior to the revised screening guidelines issued in 2012.  Results and limitations:   Metastatic PCA, steadily declining from 2004 to 2007 by 1.45%/yr, began to increase by 0.58%/yr after 2008, which accelerated to 2.74%/yr following the 2012 United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations-a pattern that was magnified among men aged ‚â§69 yr and white men. Forecasts project the incidence to increase by 1.03%/yr through 2025, with men aged 45-54 yr (2.29%/yr) and 55-69 yr (1.53%/yr) increasing more rapidly. Meanwhile, the annual burden is expected to increase 42% by 2025. Our forecasts estimated an additional 15 891 metastatic cases from 2015 to 2025 compared with alternative forecasts using trends prior to 2012.  Conclusions:   The recent uptick in metastatic PCA rates has resulted in forecasts that project increasing rates through 2025, particularly among men aged ‚â§69 yr. Moreover, racial disparities are expected to persist and the annual burden will increase considerably. The impact of the prior and current PCA screening recommendations on metastatic PCA rates requires continued examination.  Patient summary:   In this report, we assessed how the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has changed over recent years, and forecast future incidence trends and the number of new cases expected each year. We found that the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has been increasing more rapidly since 2012, resulting in a rise in both future incidence and the number of new cases by 2025.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility and the benefit of using the extraperitoneal (EP) approach with six trocars over a 4-cm distance in a flat or 5¬∞ Trendelenburg position. We also introduced four new steps to the surgical procedure and compared the surgical results and complications between the EP and TP approach using propensity score matching.  Methods:   Between August 2012 and August 2016, 200 consecutive patients without any physical restrictions underwent RARP with the EP approach in a less than 5¬∞ Trendelenburg position, and 428 consecutive patients underwent RARP with the TP approach in a steep Trendelenburg position. Four new steps to RARP using the EP approach were developed: 1) arranging six trocars; 2) creating the EP space using laparoscopic forceps; 3) holding the separated prostate in the EP space outside the robotic view; and 4) preventing a postoperative inguinal hernia. Clinicopathological results and complications were compared between the EP and TP approaches using propensity score matching. Propensity scores were calculated for each patient using multivariate logistic regression based on the preoperative covariates.  Results:   All 200 patients safely underwent RARP using the EP approach. The mean volume of estimated blood loss and duration of indwelling urethral catheter use were significantly lower with the EP approach than the TP approach (139.9 vs 184.9 mL, p = 0.03 and 5.6 vs 7.7 days, p < 0.01, respectively). No significant differences in the positive surgical margin were observed. None of the patients developed an inguinal hernia postoperatively after we introduced this technique.  Conclusions:   The EP approach to RARP was safely performed regardless of patient physique or contraindications to a steep Trendelenburg position. Our method, which involved using the EP approach to perform RARP, can decrease the amount of perioperative blood loss, the duration of indwelling urethral catheter use, and the incidence of postoperative inguinal hernia development.""","""['Satoshi Kurokawa', 'Yukihiro Umemoto', 'Kentaro Mizuno', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Akihiro Nakane', 'Hidenori Nishio', 'Shuzo Hamamoto', 'Ryosuke Ando', 'Noriyasu Kawai', 'Keiichi Tozawa', 'Yutaro Hayashi', 'Takahiro Yasui']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Rate of Symptomatic Lymphocele Formation After Extraperitoneal vs Transperitoneal Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Bilateral Pelvic Lymphadenectomy.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', ""Extraperitoneal vs. transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy-analysis of perioperative outcomes, a single surgeon's experience."", 'Extraperitoneal versus transperitoneal approach for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Extraperitoneal tissue retraction technique: An effective assistant of extraperitoneal pure single-port robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci Si surgical system.', ""The 'prostate-muscle index': a simple pelvic cavity measurement predicting estimated blood loss and console time in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy."", 'Impact of Pelvic Anatomical Changes Caused by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Techniques of robotic radical prostatectomy for the management of prostate cancer: which one, when and why.', 'Comparison of longitudinal health-related quality-of-life outcomes between anterior and posterior surgical approaches to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

These studies are of tremendous importance for accurate cancer diagnosis and subtype recognition. However, the microarray data of gene expression profiles have small samples, high dimensionality, large noise and data redundancy. To further improve the classification performance of microarray data, a gene selection approach based on the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) is proposed. First, the FLD method is employed to reduce the preliminarily genetic data to obtain features with a strong classification ability, which can form a candidate gene subset. Then, neighborhood precision and neighborhood roughness are defined in a neighborhood decision system, and the calculation approaches for neighborhood dependency and the significance of an attribute are given. A reduction model of neighborhood decision systems is presented. Thus, a gene selection algorithm based on FLD and NRS is proposed. Finally, four public gene datasets are used in the simulation experiments. Experimental results under the SVM classifier demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective, and it can select a smaller and more well-classified gene subset, as well as obtain better classification performance.""","""['Lin Sun', 'Xiaoyu Zhang', 'Jiucheng Xu', 'Wei Wang', 'Ruonan Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['Tumor classification by combining PNN classifier ensemble with neighborhood rough set based gene reduction.', 'Cancer classification from the gene expression profiles by Discriminant Kernel-PLS.', 'A DSRPCL-SVM approach to informative gene analysis.', 'Evaluation of gene importance in microarray data based upon probability of selection.', 'Gene selection for tumor classification using neighborhood rough sets and entropy measures.', 'Feature Selection Combining Information Theory View and Algebraic View in the Neighborhood Decision System.', 'An Attribute Reduction Method Using Neighborhood Entropy Measures in Neighborhood Rough Sets.', 'A Neighborhood Rough Sets-Based Attribute Reduction Method Using Lebesgue and Entropy Measures.', 'A Hybrid Gene Selection Method Based on ReliefF and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Tumor Classification.']"""

We aimed to develop a novel clinical-genomic risk grouping system that can readily be incorporated into treatment guidelines for localized prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Two multicenter cohorts (n = 991) were used for training and validation of the clinical-genomic risk groups, and two additional cohorts (n = 5,937) were used for reclassification analyses. Competing risks analysis was used to estimate the risk of distant metastasis. Time-dependent c-indices were constructed to compare clinicopathologic risk models with the clinical-genomic risk groups. Results With a median follow-up of 8 years for patients in the training cohort, 10-year distant metastasis rates for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low, favorable-intermediate, unfavorable-intermediate, and high-risk were 7.3%, 9.2%, 38.0%, and 39.5%, respectively. In contrast, the three-tier clinical-genomic risk groups had 10-year distant metastasis rates of 3.5%, 29.4%, and 54.6%, for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk, respectively, which were consistent in the validation cohort (0%, 25.9%, and 55.2%, respectively). C-indices for the clinical-genomic risk grouping system (0.84; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93) were improved over NCCN (0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.86) and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.84), and 30% of patients using NCCN low/intermediate/high would be reclassified by the new three-tier system and 67% of patients would be reclassified from NCCN six-tier (very-low- to very-high-risk) by the new six-tier system. Conclusion A commercially available genomic classifier in combination with standard clinicopathologic variables can generate a simple-to-use clinical-genomic risk grouping that more accurately identifies patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for metastasis and can be easily incorporated into current guidelines to better risk-stratify patients.""","""['Daniel E Spratt', 'Jingbin Zhang', 'Mar√≠a Santiago-Jim√©nez', 'Robert T Dess', 'John W Davis', 'Robert B Den', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Alan Pollack', 'Radka Stoyanova', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Adam Cole', 'Edward Uchio', 'Josh M Randall', 'Hao Nguyen', 'Shuang G Zhao', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Andrew G Glass', 'Lucia L C Lam', 'Jijumon Chelliserry', 'Marguerite du Plessis', 'Voleak Choeurng', 'Maria Aranes', 'Tyler Kolisnik', 'Jennifer Margrave', 'Jason Alter', 'Jennifer Jordan', 'Christine Buerki', 'Kasra Yousefi', 'Zaid Haddad', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Ashutosh Tewari', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Sheila Weinmann', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Eric A Klein', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer: Genomic information improves risk prediction.', 'Prostate cancer: Genomic information improves risk prediction.', 'Optimization of Risk Stratification in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Development and Validation of a Novel Integrated Clinical-Genomic Risk Group Classification for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic Classifier for Guiding Treatment of Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancers to Dose-Escalated Image Guided Radiation Therapy Without Hormone Therapy.', 'Genomic Validation of 3-Tiered Clinical Subclassification of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Utilization of biopsy-based genomic classifier to predict distant metastasis after definitive radiation and short-course ADT for intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis of the Performance of the Decipher Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Men After Prostatectomy to Predict Development of Metastatic Disease.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence Predictive Model for Hormone Therapy Use in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted gene expression profiling predicts meningioma outcomes and radiotherapy responses.', 'Prostate Cancer Tumor Volume and Genomic Risk.', 'Analysis of a Biopsy-Based Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Meta-Analysis of the NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9202, 9413, and 9902 Phase 3 Randomized Trials.']"""

Methods: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was performed in seven mCSPC patients before and after six cycles of upfront docetaxel chemotherapy and in 16 mCRPC patients before and after three cycles of palliative docetaxel chemotherapy. Radiographic treatment response was evaluated separately on the 68Ga-PSMA PET and CT datasets. Changes in 68Ga-PSMA uptake (SUVmean) were assessed on a per-patient and a per-lesion basis using the PERCIST scoring system with slight modification. Treatment response was defined as absence of any PSMA uptake in all target lesions on posttreatment PET (complete response, CR) or a decrease in summed SUVmean of ‚â•30% (partial response, PR). The appearance of a new PET-positive lesion or an increase in summed SUVmean of ‚â•30% (progressive disease, PD) indicated nonresponse. A moderate change in summed SUVmean (between -30% and +30%) without a change in the number of target lesions was defined as stable disease (SD). For treatment response assessment on CT, RECIST1.1 criteria were used. Radiographic responses on 68Ga-PSMA PET [RR(PET)] and on CT [RR(CT)] were compared and correlated with biochemical response (BR). A decrease in serum PSA level of ‚â•50% was defined as biochemical PR.  Results:   Biochemical PR was found in six of seven patients with mCSPC (86%, 95% confidence interval 42% to 99.6%). The concordance rate was higher between BR and RR(PET) than between BR and RR(CT) (6/7 vs. 3/6 patients. 68Ga-PSMA PET and CT were concordant in only three patients (50%, 12% to 88%). In mCRPC patients, biochemical PR was found in six of 16 patients (38%, 15% to 65%). Outcome prediction was concordant between BR and RR(PET) in nine of 16 patients (56%), and between BR and RR(CT) in only four of 12 patients (33%) with target lesions on CT. 68Ga-PSMA PET and CT results corresponded in seven of 12 patients (58%, 28% to 85%).  Conclusion:   Our preliminary results suggest that 68Ga-PSMA PET might be a promising method for treatment response assessment in mCSPC and mCRPC. The data indicate that for different metastatic sites, the performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET in response assessment might be superior to that of the conventional CT approach and could help differentiate between progressive disease and treatment response. Because of the limited number of patients, the differences revealed in our study were not statistically significant. Thus larger and prospective studies are clearly needed and warranted to confirm the value of 68Ga-PSMA PET as an imaging biomarker for response assessment.""","""['Anna Katharina Seitz', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Markus Kr√∂nke', 'Sophia Luther', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Thomas Horn', 'J√ºrgen E Gschwend', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Tobias Maurer']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Assessment of the role of Ga-68 PSMA I&T PET/CT in response evaluation to docetaxel therapy in castration resistant prostate cancer patients.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Response Assessment and Outcome Prediction in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Taxane-Based Chemotherapy.', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'Performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Management at Initial Staging and Time of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'Metabolic patterns on 18FFDG PET/CT in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC undergoing chemoradiotherapy\u2009¬±\u2009durvalumab maintenance treatment.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression on PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Observational Study.', 'PSMA PET/CT: joint EANM procedure guideline/SNMMI procedure standard for prostate cancer imaging 2.0.']"""

Following ALSYMPCA, which demonstrated radium-223 survival benefit, and before radium-223 U.S. commercial availability, an expanded access program (EAP) providing early-access radium-223 allowed life-prolonging therapies in current use.  Subjects, materials, and methods:   This phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter U.S. EAP (NCT01516762) enrolled patients with symptomatic mCRPC, ‚â•2 bone metastases, and no lung, liver, or brain metastases. Patients received radium-223 55 kBq/kg intravenously every 4 weeks √ó 6. Primary outcomes were acute and long-term safety. Additional analyses were done by number of radium-223 injections, and prior or concomitant abiraterone or enzalutamide use.  Results:   Of 252 patients, 184 received radium-223: 165/184 (90%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1; 183 (99%) had prior systemic anticancer therapy. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 93/184 (51%) patients during treatment and 11 (6%) during follow-up. Median overall survival was 17 months, with 134/184 (73%) patients censored because of short follow-up due to radium-223 approval. In post hoc analyses, patients with ‚â•3 prior anticancer medications, baseline ECOG performance status ‚â•2, and lower baseline hemoglobin were less likely to receive 5-6 radium-223 injections and unlikely to benefit from radium-223.

The current study seeks to validate the prognostic performance of the changes in the new system among clinically staged prostate cancer patients registered within the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) database.  Methods:   SEER database (2004-2014) has been accessed through SEER*Stat program and AJCC 7th and 8th edition stages were calculated utilizing T, N and M stages as well as baseline prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and grade group. Cancer-specific and overall survival analyses according to 6th, 7th and 8th editions were conducted through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Moreover, multivariate analysis was conducted through a Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   A total of 110499 patients with prostate cancer were identified in the period from 2004-2014.For cancer- specific survival according to 8th AJCC, all pair wise P values for comparison were significant (<0.01) except for stage IIA vs. IIB; while for overall survival according to 8th AJCC, all pair wise P values for comparison were significant (<0.02) except for stage IIIA vs. IIIB. Results of c-index assessment for cancer-specific survival for the three AJCC editions were as follows: c-index for AJCC 6th edition was 0.816; c-index for AJCC 7th edition was 0.897; c-index for AJCC 8th edition was 0.907. For stage IVB prostate cancer (i.e.M1 disease), further sub-staging was proposed according to M1 sub-stage (i.e. M1a, M1b and M1c). Pair wise comparison between these proposed sub-stages was conducted for both cancer-specific and overall survival. For both cancer-specific and overall survival, all pair wise P values for comparisons were <0.0001.

Various molecular mechanisms account for PCa progression and elucidation of these mechanisms is key for selection of optimal therapies and improvement of patient outcome. Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) has been identified as a novel biomarker for PCa, but its biological functions and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.  Method:   GOLM1 expression was determined in PCa by tissue microarrays (TMAs) and real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. To investigate GOLM1 functions in vitro and in vivo, we overexpressed and knocked down GOLM1 in PCa cell lines and established xenograft mice models. A series of cytological function assays were used to determine the role of GOLM1 in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway downstream of GOLM1 was detected by Western blot and IHC analyses.  Result:   GOLM1 expression is up-regulated in PCa of all stages and grades. GOLM1 promotes proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibits apoptosis in PCa cell lines (DU145, PC3, and CWR22Rv1) and xenograft mice models. Moreover, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling is positively regulated by GOLM1, whereas PI3 K inhibitor BKM120 significantly abrogates the oncogenic functions of GOLM1.  Conclusion:   GOLM1 acts as a critical oncogene by promoting PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibiting apoptosis. GOLM1 plays oncogenic functions mainly through activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, agents that block PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway could be used in PCa patients with GOLM1 up-regulation.""","""['Guang Yan', 'Yi Ru', 'Kerong Wu', 'Fengqi Yan', 'Qinhao Wang', 'Jingxiang Wang', 'Tao Pan', 'Mei Zhang', 'Hua Han', 'Xia Li', 'Lian Zou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['CORRIGENDUM.', 'Ribosomal protein L22-like1 promotes prostate cancer progression by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.', 'Muscleblind-like 1 antisense RNA 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer by sponging miR-181a-5p and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'GPCR48/LGR4 promotes tumorigenesis of prostate cancer via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'siRNA-mediated stathmin1 silencing inhibits proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Ribosomal protein L22-like1 promotes prostate cancer progression by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.', 'GOLM1 is related to the inflammatory/immune nature of uveal melanoma and acts as a promising indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response.', 'Microcystin‚Äëleucine arginine promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation by activating the PI3K/Akt/Wnt/Œ≤‚Äëcatenin pathway.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.']"""

Initial results of metabolic response in repeated PSMA PET/CTs after hypofractionated IGRT for metastatic lesions are reported here.  Materials and methods:   Of 280 patients investigated with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the period from 01/2014 through 12/2016 in the authors' department, patients were selected according to the following criteria: oligometastatic disease at initial PSMA PET/CT defined as not more than five metastatic lesions, hypofractionated IGRT to all lesions, no systemic therapy in the last 6 months and during follow-up, and at least one follow-up PSMA PET after radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was administered to all PSMA PET-detected lesions (CTV = PET-GTV + 1 to 2 mm), mostly with 35 Gy in five fractions (one lesion with four fractions of 7 Gy due to dose constraints, two lymph nodes with 50 Gy in 25 fractions to an extended volume plus a boost of 7 Gy √ó 2 to the PET-positive volume). Metabolic response of irradiated lesions was evaluated on repeated PSMA PET/CTs according to PERCIST criteria. Five patients with a total number of 12 PSMA PETs matched the criteria. Patients received radiotherapy to all PET-positive lesions and had at least one (in one case three) follow-up PSMA PET examinations after radiotherapy with an interval to the first PET of 2-15 months; the median follow-up for all patients was 11 months.  Results:   The mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values at the time of examination were 8.9 ¬± 8.5 ng/ml (median 3.3 ng/ml, range 0.17-21.8 ng/ml). A total number of 18 metastatic deposits were detected. The PET-positive tumor volume was 5.9 ¬± 13.3 cm3 (median 1.25 cm3). The mean standardized uptake value (mean SUVmax) of the 18 metastatic lesions decreased from 19.9 ¬± 23.3 (mean ¬± SD) prior to RT to 5.4 ¬± 4.6 at post-radiotherapy PSMA PET/CT. Using PERCIST criteria, 14 lesions (78%) showed a metabolic response in PSMA PET with a reduction of SUV of at least 30%, as well as a significant decrease in lesion size; in seven of these lesions, no uptake of 68Ga-PSMA was detectable. In follow-up PET scans, only two lesions showed metabolic progression with an increase in SUVmax yielding a local progression-free survival of 88% after 1 year. There was a correlation between the time interval after radiotherapy (median 3 months, range 1-9 months) and response (p = 0.04) with better metabolic response after longer follow-up.  Conclusions:   Preliminary results of this study show high metabolic response rates of PSMA PET-positive metastatic lesions after hypofractionated radiotherapy in follow-up PSMA PET with promising local control rates.

Setting:   Johns Hopkins University (JHU); Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS); University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); and University of Toronto (UT) AS studies.  Patients:   2576 men aged 40 to 80 years with a GS between 2 and 6 and clinical stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer enrolled between 1995 and 2014.  Measurements:   PSA levels and biopsy GSs.  Results:   After variable surveillance intervals and competing treatments were accounted for, estimated risks for biopsy upgrading were similar in the PASS and UT studies but higher in UCSF and lower in JHU studies. All cohorts had a delay of 3 to 5 months in detecting upgrading with biennial biopsies starting after a first confirmatory biopsy versus annual biopsies.  Limitation:   The model does not account for possible misclassification of biopsy GS.  Conclusion:   Men in different AS studies have different risks for biopsy upgrading after variable surveillance protocols and competing treatments are accounted for. Despite these differences, the consequences of more versus less frequent biopsies seem to be similar across cohorts. Biennial biopsies seem to be an acceptable alternative to annual biopsies.

We proposed a novel method, called iFCR (internal Fusion Clone Ratio), given an estimation of oncogenic potential for fusion mutations. We have evaluated the iFCR method in three public cancer transcriptome sequencing datasets; the results demonstrated that the fusion mutations occurring in tumor samples have higher internal fusion clone ratio than normal samples.

In this study, we determined the mechanism of action of this drug. The basis for its activity was illuminated by solving the crystal structure of DJ101 in complex with tubulin at a resolution of 2.8√Ö. Investigations of the potency of DJ101 in a panel of human metastatic melanoma cell lines harboring major clinically relevant mutations defined IC50 values of 7-10 nmol/L. In cells, DJ101 disrupted microtubule networks, suppressed anchorage-dependent melanoma colony formation, and impaired cancer cell migration. In melanoma-bearing mice, DJ101 administration inhibited tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis in the absence of observable toxicity. DJ101 also completely inhibited tumor growth in a paclitaxel-resistant xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer (PC-3/TxR), where paclitaxel was minimally effective.

These include the presence of clonal populations, the phylogenetic structure of those populations, the degree of the complexity of copy-number changes in those populations, and measures of the proportion of cells with clonal copy-number signatures. The parameters all showed good correlation to the measure of prostatic malignancy, the Gleason score, derived from individual prostate biopsy tissue cores. Remarkably, a more accurate histopathologic measure of malignancy, the surgical Gleason score, agrees better with these genomic parameters of diagnostic biopsy than it does with the diagnostic Gleason score and related measures of diagnostic histopathology. This is highly relevant because primary treatment decisions are dependent upon the biopsy and not the surgical specimen. Thus, single-cell analysis has the potential to augment traditional core histopathology, improving both the objectivity and accuracy of risk assessment and inform treatment decisions.Significance: Genomic analysis of multiple individual cells harvested from prostate biopsies provides an indepth view of cell populations comprising a prostate neoplasm, yielding novel genomic measures with the potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis in prostate cancer.

Several of those patients exhibit intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms that limit efficacy of PARPi monotherapy. Here we show how the efficacy of PARPi in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) can be expanded by targeting MYC-induced oncogenic addiction. In BRCA-mutant/sporadic TNBC patients, amplification of the MYC gene is correlated with increased expression of the homologous DNA recombination enzyme RAD51 and tumors overexpressing both genes are associated with worse overall survival. Combining MYC blockade with PARPi yielded synthetic lethality in MYC-driven TNBC cells. Using the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib, which downregulates MYC expression, we found that combination with the PARPi niraparib increased DNA damage and downregulated homologous recombination, leading to subsequent downregulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-like cell phenotypes. Notably, dinaciclib resensitized TBNC cells, which had acquired resistance to niraparib. We found that the synthetic lethal strategy employing dinaciclib and niraparib was also highly efficacious in ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer cells. Taken together, our results show how blunting MYC oncogene addiction can leverage cancer cell sensitivity to PARPi, facilitating the clinical use of c-myc as a predictive biomarker for this treatment.Significance: Dual targeting of MYC-regulated homologous recombination and PARP-mediated DNA repair yields potent synthetic lethality in triple-negative breast tumors and other aggressive tumors characterized by MYC overexpression.

Methods: A retrospective study of 104 cases of prostate cancer in peripheral zone was conducted, all of the patients were histopathologically confirmed by transrectal ultrasound guided saturation biopsy or radical prostatectomy in Tongji Hospital of Tongji University from January 2012 to December 2015.All MRI imaging examinations were performed by using a 3.0T Siemens Verio MRI scanner.The imaging protocol consisted of high-resolution axial and sagittal T(2) weighted imaging (T(2)WI), axial acquired diffusion weighted imaging (aDWI) with b=0, 50, 1 000 s/mm(2) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) scans.Computed diffusion weighted imaging (cDWI) images with b=1 000, 1 400, 2 000 s/mm(2) were processed by Matlab.These three groups of cDWI images were analyzed according to the PI-RADS v2 criteria, and signal intensity of ratio (SIR) of lesions were analyzed by independent t test and one-way ANOVA in each group. Results: The numbers of cases with a DWI score of 2 and 5 were similar among three groups.Nine cases (33.3%) in all 27 cases with a DWI score of 3 on b=1 000 s/mm(2) upgraded to score 4 when b-value rose to 1 400 and 2 000 s/mm(2).The ratios of SIR of lesions in cases upgraded from DWI score 3 to 4 to those unchanged cases on b=1 400 and 2 000 s/mm(2) were 1.86¬±0.21 to 1.61¬±0.27 and 2.18¬±0.26 to 1.75¬±0.30, respectively (t=2.486, t=3.671, both P<0.05). In these 9 cases who upgraded to DWI score 4, SIRs of the lesion were significantly different between groups when b=1 000, 1 400 and 2 000 s/mm(2) (F=10.907, 33.768, 8.043, all P<0.05), and their SIRs increased with the rising of b-value. Conclusions: The computed high b-value (b‚â•1 400 s/mm(2)) mainly affects cases with a DWI score of 3, but DWI scores would not change neither in b=1 400 s/mm(2) nor in 2 000 s/mm(2) cases. For DWI score in PI-RADS v2 of prostate cancer in peripheral zone, b=1 400 s/mm(2) is probably of more scoring value than b=1 000 or 2 000 s/mm(2).""","""['W Wang', 'Z H Shao', 'J Q Zeng', 'D L Wu', 'G L Wang', 'P J Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Effects of dynamic contrast enhancement on diffusion weighted imaging score of 3 in prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 of peripheral zone.', 'Preliminary applicability evaluation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 diagnostic score in 3.0T multi-parameters magnetic resonance imaging combined with prostate specific antigen density for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the prostate imaging reporting and data system for the detection of prostate cancer by the results of targeted biopsy of the prostate.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS): What the radiologists need to know?']"""

Subjects and methods:   Forty one patients were studied, divided into 2 groups based on histologically confirmed diagnosis: a) Breast cancer group, 23 women, mean age: 61¬±12 years, range: 37-79 years and, b) Prostate cancer group, 18 men, mean age 68¬±8 years, range: 52-82 years. Another group of 17 non cancer atherosclerotic subjects 9 women and 8 men, of mean age and age range similar to the above were also studied for comparison. The R index (the total count rate in bone metastases divided by the total count rate in a contralateral area), the maximum semi-quantitative standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of BS lesions and the mean number of metastases were evaluated. For the metastatic findings in the PET/CT scans the automatic method of contouring with 50% background cut-off was used, while for the 99mTc-MDP BS metastases were delineated manually.  Results:   The mean R index of the bone metastatic foci studied by 18F-FDG PET/CT was 1.89¬±0.69 for Groups I and II patients. There was no significant difference of the R index between prostate cancer and breast cancer metastases (1.95¬±0.86 vs 1.83¬±0.52). The average SUVmax value was significantly higher in breast cancer patients than in prostate cancer patients (5.15¬±2.54 vs 4.01¬±1.71; P<0.05). There was no significant correlation in both cancer groups between R index and SUVmax values. The number of metastatic foci diagnosed by the 99mTc-MDP BS scan was much less than by the 18F-FDG PET/CT.  Conclusion:   No significant correlation was noticed in the metabolic activity-glucose utilization of metastatic bone foci between breast and prostate cancer cases.

Associations with clinicopathological data and PC relapse were calculated. Expression of miR-205 was lower in tumor epithelium compared to normal epithelium. No association was observed between miR-205 expression in primary tumor epithelium and cancer relapse. In contrast, high expression of miR-205 in normal epithelium was independently associated with biochemical relapse (HR = 1.64, p = 0.003).

While the supplements decreased proliferation and induced cell death in cancer organoids, they had no effect on the benign organoids. In contrast, Vitamin E enhanced cell proliferation and survival in the premalignant organoids in a manner that recapitulated the SELECT results. Indeed, while Vitamin E induced a pro-proliferative gene expression signature, Selenium alone or combined with Vitamin E produced an anti-proliferative signature. The premalignant organoids also displayed significant downregulation of glucose transporter and glycolytic gene expression pointing to metabolic alterations. Detached RWPE-1 cells had low ATP levels due to diminished glucose uptake and glycolysis which was rescued by Vitamin E through the activation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO inhibition abrogated the ATP rescue, diminished survival of the inner matrix detached cells, restoring the normal hollow lumen morphology in Vitamin E treated organoids.

This work presents the validation and uncertainty analysis of a model that predicts 2D portal dose images (PDIs) without a patient or phantom in the beam. The prediction model is based on an exponential point dose model with separable primary and secondary photon fluence components. The model includes a scatter kernel, off-axis ratio map, transmission values and penumbra kernels for beam-delimiting components. These parameters were derived through a model fitting procedure supplied with point dose and dose profile measurements of radiation fields. The model was validated against a treatment planning system (TPS; Eclipse) and radiochromic film measurements for complex clinical scenarios, including volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Confidence limits on fitted model parameters were calculated based on simulated measurements. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the parameter uncertainties on the model output. For the maximum uncertainty, the maximum deviating measurement sets were propagated through the fitting procedure and the model. The overall uncertainty was assessed using all simulated measurements. The validation of the prediction model against the TPS and the film showed a good agreement, with on average 90.8% and 90.5% of pixels passing a (2%,2 mm) global gamma analysis respectively, with a low dose threshold of 10%. The maximum and overall uncertainty of the model is dependent on the type of clinical plan used as input. The results can be used to study the robustness of the model. A model for predicting accurate 2D pre-treatment PDIs in complex RT scenarios can be used clinically and its uncertainties can be taken into account.""","""['Jose A Baeza', 'Cecile J A Wolfs', 'Sebastiaan M J J G Nijsten', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Should dose from small fields be limited for dose verification procedures?: uncertainty versus small field dose in VMAT treatments.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'DEMAT: A multi-institutional dosimetry audit of rotational and static intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Robustness Analysis for External Beam Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans: Describing Uncertainty Scenarios and Reporting Their Dosimetric Consequences.', 'What is the optimal input information for deep learning-based pre-treatment error identification in radiotherapy?']"""

Previous measurements and simulations have been restricted to homogeneous water tanks. Here, a CT-based simulation method is proposed and applied to a liver and prostate case to model the effects of tissue heterogeneity on the protoacoustic amplitude and time-of-flight range verification accuracy. For the liver case, posterior irradiation with a single proton pencil beam was simulated for detectors placed on the skin. In the prostate case, a transrectal probe measured the protoacoustic pressure generated by irradiation with five separate anterior proton beams. After calculating the proton beam dose deposition, each CT voxel's material properties were mapped based on Hounsfield Unit values, and thermoacoustically-generated acoustic wave propagation was simulated with the k-Wave MATLAB toolbox. By comparing the simulation results for the original liver CT to homogenized variants, the effects of heterogeneity were assessed. For the liver case, 1.4 cGy of dose at the Bragg peak generated 50 mPa of pressure (13 cm distal), a 2√ó lower amplitude than simulated in a homogeneous water tank. Protoacoustic triangulation of the Bragg peak based on multiple detector measurements resulted in 0.4 mm accuracy for a Œ¥-function proton pulse irradiation of the liver. For the prostate case, higher amplitudes are simulated (92-1004 mPa) for closer detectors (<8 cm). For four of the prostate beams, the protoacoustic range triangulation was accurate to ‚©Ω1.6 mm (Œ¥-function proton pulse). Based on the results, application of protoacoustic range verification to heterogeneous tissue will result in decreased signal amplitudes relative to homogeneous water tank measurements, but accurate range verification is still expected to be possible.""","""['Kevin C Jones', 'Wei Nie', 'James C H Chu', 'Julius V Turian', 'Alireza Kassaee', 'Chandra M Sehgal', 'Stephen Avery']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['How proton pulse characteristics influence protoacoustic determination of proton-beam range: simulation studies.', 'Acoustic time-of-flight for proton range verification in water.', 'Two-stage ionoacoustic range verification leveraging Monte Carlo and acoustic simulations to stably account for tissue inhomogeneity and accelerator-specific time structure - A simulation study.', 'Simulation studies of time reversal-based protoacoustic reconstruction for range and dose verification in proton therapy.', 'Proton range verification in homogeneous materials through acoustic measurements.', 'Proton beam range verification by means of ionoacoustic measurements at clinically relevant doses using a correlation-based evaluation.', '3Din vivodose verification in prostate proton therapy with deep learning-based proton-acoustic imaging.', 'Proton range monitoring using 13N peak for proton therapy applications.', 'Dictionary-based protoacoustic dose map imaging for proton range verification.', 'On-line range verification for proton beam therapy using spherical ionoacoustic waves with resonant frequency.']"""

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and the PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3) urine test select for clinically significant cases. We explored how well the tests performed together with previous biopsies.

This included patients on active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer and those without prostate cancer who had previous negative biopsies and suspicion of occult disease. We explored whether age, prostate specific antigen, PCA3 score, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, digital rectal examination, family history and prostate size would predict clinically significant prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. The negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and PCA3 score was calculated.  Results:   A total of 470 patients were included in study. The PCA3 score was abnormal at 35 or greater in 32.5% of cases. In the multivariate model including 154 men only age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging PI-RADS‚Ñ¢ (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score 4 (OR 16.6, 95% CI 3.9-70.0) or 5 (OR 28.3, 95% CI 5.7-138) and PCA3 score (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.8) predicted clinically significant cancer on biopsy. No patient with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and a normal PCA3 score had clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy for a negative predictive value of 100% (p <0.0001).  Conclusions:   In patients with dual negative tests (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and PCA3 score) clinically significant prostate cancer was never found on biopsy, which may be unnecessary in this group.

The purpose of this study was to determine if there were differences in proteinase activities in urine samples collected following prostate massage of men positive (CaP) or negative (no evidence of malignancy, NEM) for biopsy determined prostate cancer. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and serine proteinase activities were detected using protein substrate zymography. There were no differences in activities of MMP-2, proMMP-9, and MMP-9/NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin) complex (gelatin substrate) in men with detected prostate cancer, although the latter two were somewhat diminished. A caseinolytic activity of about 75kDa inhibited by calcium did not differ between the NEM and CaP groups. Heparin stimulated calcium sensitive gelatinolytic activities of approximately 22, 42, and 60kDa, but did not affect activities of MMP-2, MMP-9, or the 75kDa caseinolytic activity. The 22, 42, and 60kDa activities appear to be serine proteinases since they were inhibited by benzamidine. There was a significant decrease in the 22kDa heparin-stimulated serine proteinase activity in urines of men with cancer. Proteinase expression and activities, perhaps in combination with other potential markers, may prove useful in urine for detection and evaluation of prostate cancer.""","""['David Mu√±oz', 'Maria K Serrano', 'Maria E Hernandez', 'Ross Haller', 'Tamara Swanson', 'Joel W Slaton', 'Akhouri A Sinha', 'Michael J Wilson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Tumor-specific urinary matrix metalloproteinase fingerprinting: identification of high molecular weight urinary matrix metalloproteinase species.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in the urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'Induction of a heparin-stimulated serine proteinase in sex accessory gland tumors of the Lobund-Wistar rat.', 'Gelatinolytic and caseinolytic proteinase activities in human prostatic secretions.', 'Diagnostic value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/matrix metalloproteinase-9 pathway in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Parallel-Reaction-Monitoring-Based Proteome-Wide Profiling of Differential Kinase Protein Expression during Prostate Cancer Metastasis in Vitro.']"""

Given that stage is incompletely recorded, we investigated the extent to which this indicator reflects underlying organisational differences rather than differences in stage completeness and chance variation.  Methods:   We used population-based data on patients diagnosed with one of ten cancer sites in 2013 (bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung, ovarian, prostate, renal, NHL, and melanoma). We assessed the degree of bias in CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) indicators introduced by missing-is-late and complete-case specifications compared with an imputed 'gold standard'. We estimated the Spearman-Brown (organisation-level) reliability of the complete-case specification. We assessed probable misclassification rates against current pay-for-performance targets.  Results:   Under the missing-is-late approach, bias in estimated CCG percentage of tumours diagnosed at an early stage ranged from -2 to -30 percentage points, while bias under the complete-case approach ranged from -2 to +7 percentage points. Using an annual reporting period, indicators based on the least biased complete-case approach would have poor reliability, misclassifying 27/209 (13%) CCGs against a pay-for-performance target in current use; only half (53%) of CCGs apparently exceeding the target would be correctly classified in terms of their underlying performance.  Conclusions:   Current public reporting schemes for cancer stage at diagnosis in England should use a complete-case specification (i.e. the number of staged cases forming the denominator) and be based on three-year reporting periods.

Prior analyses have not generally corroborated relationships between prostate or urethral dose and urinary toxicity after brachytherapy, but such analyses have been performed on cohorts all receiving the same prescribed dose. We analyzed patients treated to differing prescription doses to assess acute urinary morbidity with dose reduction.  Methods and materials:   Patients treated with Pd-103 to either 125 Gy or 90-100 Gy were compared using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 1-month postimplant. Patients in the 90-100 Gy cohort began external beam radiation therapy after their 1-month assessment; thus, toxicities were measured before contribution from external beam radiation therapy. Patient/treatment characteristics were compared to verify subgroup homogeneity. Dose and change in IPSS 1 month after treatment were assessed using a multivariate linear regression model.  Results:   One hundred ninety-one and 41 patients were treated with 125 Gy versus 90-100 Gy, respectively. Preimplant and postimplant prostate volumes and initial IPSS were similar between groups. Higher prescription dose and increased pretreatment IPSS were independent predictors of increased 1-month IPSS. In addition, every 10 percentage point additional prostate volume receiving a given dose was associated with increase in IPSS after treatment for the same level of pretreatment IPSS.  Conclusion:   Lower prescription dose and decreased volume of high-dose regions to the prostate correlated with reduced acute urinary morbidity after brachytherapy. Our findings suggest that focal treatment approaches with modest dose reductions to subregions of the prostate may reduce acute morbidity and potentially expand the number of patients eligible for brachytherapy.""","""['Adam Ferro', 'Hee Joon Bae', 'Gayane Yenokyan', 'Yi Le', 'Todd McNutt', 'Omar Mian', 'Carol Gergis', 'Chloe Haviland', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Daniel Y Song']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Androgen deprivation-induced changes in prostate anatomy predict urinary morbidity after permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'The influence of isotope and prostate volume on urinary morbidity after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prophylactic versus therapeutic alpha-blockers after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Review on the effectiveness of prostate cancer brachytherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) recommendations for transperineal permanent brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Determining Combined Modality Dosimetric Constraints by Integration of IMRT and LDR Prostate Brachytherapy Dosimetry and Correlation with Toxicity.', 'Focal low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Phase II study of intraoperative dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy using registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy.']"""

An initial screening was carried out to evaluate their cytotoxic potential on a panel of six cancer cell lines namely, cervical (HeLa), gastric (HGC-27), lung (NCI-H460), prostate (DU-145 and PC-3) and breast (4T1), using MTT assay. Among the compounds tested, compounds 12e, 12r and 12t showed potent growth inhibition and 12t {(1E,4E)-1-(3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-2-yl)-5-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one} being the most active member of the series inhibited the growth of all the tested cell lines with IC50 values varying from 1.7 - 2.97 ŒºM.

The results from aqueous solubility test showed that compounds 12e and 12t have 1.7 and 2.8 times more aqueous solubility than curcumin. Interestingly, the most active compound 12t was found to be nearly 2 times more selective on PC-3 cells as well as safe on normal human prostate (RWPE-1) cells.

Cell cycle analysis revealed that 12t arrests PC-3 cells in G2/M phase in a dose dependant manner. Further, treatment of PC-3 cells with 12t showed typical apoptotic morphology, also led to the impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential (DŒ®m) and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altogether, the results from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO-EB) and DAPI staining studies, annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining assay, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (DŒ®m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels undoubtedly demonstrated the induction of apoptosis in PC-3 cells by compound 12t.""","""['P V Sri Ramya', 'Lalita Guntuku', 'Srinivas Angapelly', 'Chander Singh Digwal', 'Uppu Jaya Lakshmi', 'Dilep Kumar Sigalapalli', 'Bathini Nagendra Babu', 'V G M Naidu', 'Ahmed Kamal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of curcumin inspired indole analogues as tubulin polymerization inhibitors.', 'Synthesis of thiazole linked indolyl-3-glyoxylamide derivatives as tubulin polymerization inhibitors.', 'Synthesis of substituted biphenyl methylene indolinones as apoptosis inducers and tubulin polymerization inhibitors.', 'Design, synthesis and anti-breast cancer evaluation of biaryl pyridine analogues as potent RSK inhibitors.', 'Anti-Proliferative Potential of Fluorinated Curcumin Analogues: Experimental and Computational Analysis and Review of the Literature.', 'Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Molecular Modeling Studies of 1-Aryl-1H-pyrazole-Fused Curcumin Analogues as Anticancer Agents.', 'Pyridine: the scaffolds with significant clinical diversity.', 'Synthesis, human topoisomerase IIŒ± inhibitory properties and molecular modeling studies of anti-proliferative curcumin mimics.', 'Synthesis of 4-alkylaminoimidazo1,2-apyridines linked to carbamate moiety as potent Œ±-glucosidase inhibitors.', 'Beyond the Paclitaxel and Vinca Alkaloids: Next Generation of Plant-Derived Microtubule-Targeting Agents with Potential Anticancer Activity.']"""

Here we show using cultured osteoblasts that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and VEGF-A increased receptor activator of NFŒ∫B ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF, two essential factors for osteoclastogenesis. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) also increased RANKL and M-CSF via c-Met transactivation.

In vivo experiments used cabozantinib-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and C4-2B) to test the effects of c-Met/VEGFR2 inhibition specifically in osteoblasts. Cabozantinib (60 mg/kg, 3 weeks) suppressed tumor growth in bone and reduced expression of RANKL and M-CSF and subsequent tumor-induced osteolysis.

Sixty clinically treated prostate/prostate bed intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were exported from an in-house TPS and were used to create a KBP model in a newly implemented commercial application. To determine the benefit that KBP may have in a TPS transition, the model was tested on 2 groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of the first 10 prostate/prostate bed patients treated in the commercial TPS after the transition from the in-house TPS. Group 2 consisted of 10 patients planned in the commercial TPS after 8 months of clinical use. The KBP-generated plan was compared with the clinically used plan in terms of plan quality (ability to meet planning objectives and overall dose metrics) and planning efficiency (time required to generate clinically acceptable plans). The KBP-generated plans provided a significantly improved target coverage (p = 0.01) compared with the clinically used plans for Group 1, but yielded plans of comparable target coverage to the clinically used plans for Group 2. For the organs at risk, the KBP-generated plans produced lower doses, on average, for every normal-tissue objective except for the maximum dose to 0.1 cc of rectum. The time needed for the KBP-generated plans ranged from 6 to 15 minutes compared to 30 to 150 and 15 to 60 minutes for manual planning in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. KBP is a promising tool to aid in the transition to a new TPS.

Prognostic biomarkers discriminating indolent from aggressive disease in prostate biopsy are urgently needed. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of Ki67, EZH2, LSD1, and SMYD3 immunoexpression in diagnostic biopsies from a cohort of PCa patients with long term follow-up.  Materials and methods:   A series of 189 consecutive prostate biopsies diagnosed with PCa (1997-2001) in a cancer center was included in the study, with follow-up last updated in November 2016. Biopsies were reviewed and graded according to 2016 WHO criteria. Immunohistochemistry was performed in the most representative block. Nuclear staining was assessed using digital image analysis. Study outcomes included disease-specific, disease-free, and progression-free survival. Statistical analysis was tabulated using SPSS version 22.0. Survival curves and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Kaplan-Meyer and Cox-regression models, respectively. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.  Results:   The proportion of patients who completed the study was 177/189 (94%). In univariable analysis, high Ki67, EZH2, and SMYD3 immunoexpression associated with significantly worse disease-specific survival (HR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.05-3.29; HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.10-3.27; HR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.02-7.92). In multivariable analysis, the 3 biomarkers displayed significantly worse DSS adjusted for CAPRA score (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.01-3.16; HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.12-3.32; HR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.04-7.10). Among patients with low/intermediate risk CAPRA score, high Ki67 immunoexpression identified those more prone to experience disease recurrence (HR = 9.20, 95% CI: 1.27-66.44) and progression (HR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.05-8.43).

The dye-labeled probe aptamer (PA) product was adsorbed onto the benzimidazole derivative-containing Cu-MOG via electrostatic incorporation and strong œÄ-œÄ stacking interactions, which significantly increased the FA value due to the enlargement of the molecular volume of the PA/Cu-MOG complex. With the introduction of target PSA, the FA value was obviously decreased on account of the specific recognition between PSA and PA which resulted in the detachment of PA from the surface of MOG. The linear range was from 0.5-8ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.33ng/mL.

The effect of these findings on the opinions of North American genitourinary (GU) experts regarding the role of active surveillance for these patients has not been previously examined.  Materials and methods:   A survey was distributed to 88 practicing North American GU physicians serving on decision-making committees of cooperative group research organizations. Questions pertained to appropriateness of active surveillance in patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk (Gleason 3+4) disease. Opinions regarding active surveillance were correlated with practice patterns using Fisher exact test.  Results:   Forty-two radiation oncologists completed the survey. Forty percent had been in practice for more than 20 years; 90% practice at an academic center. Forty-five percent see ‚â• 20 patients per month in consultation. More than 95% (40 of 42) recommended active surveillance for Gleason 6 disease, whereas only 17% recommended active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease. There were no demographic differences between supporters or opponents regarding active surveillance with regard to monthly patient volume, practice type, likelihood of self-identifying as an expert brachytherapist, belief in advanced imaging techniques, or preferred default external beam radiation therapy dose/fractionation for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. However, there was a trend toward greater support of active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease among experts having practiced < 10 years versus ‚â• 10 years (P = .085).  Conclusion:   Active surveillance is almost universally supported by North American GU expert radiation oncologists for low-risk prostate cancer. However, there is very weak support for this strategy in Gleason 3+4 disease despite the ProtecT trial providing level 1 evidentiary support in both risk groups. There were no significant differences between experts supporting versus opposing active surveillance for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease.

Unfortunately tissue induced signal attenuation limits the value of this technique to superficial applications. By positioning the fluorescence camera via a dedicated navigation setup we reasoned that the technology could be made compatible with deeper lesions, increasing its impact on clinical care. Such an impact would benefit from the ability to implement the navigation technology in different surgical settings. For that reason we evaluated whether a single fluorescence camera could be navigated toward targeted lesions during open and laparoscopic surgery.  Materials and methods:   A fluorescence camera with scopes available for open and laparoscopic procedures was integrated with a navigation platform. Lymph nodes identified on SPECT/CT (single photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography) or free-hand single photon emission computerized tomography acted as navigation targets and were displayed as augmented overlays in the fluorescence camera video feed. The accuracy of this setup was evaluated in a phantom study of 4 scans per single photon emission computerized tomography imaging modality. This was followed by 4 first in human translations into sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures for penile (open surgery) and prostate (laparoscopic surgery) cancer.  Results:   Overall the phantom studies revealed a tool-target distance accuracy of 2.1 mm for SPECT/CT and 3.2 mm for freehand single photon emission computerized tomography, and an augmented reality registration accuracy of 1.1 and 2.2 mm, respectively. Subsequently open and laparoscopic navigation efforts were accurate enough to localize the fluorescence signals of the targeted tissues in vivo.  Conclusions:   The phantom and human studies performed suggested that the single navigation setup is applicable in various open and laparoscopic urological surgery applications. Further evaluation in larger patient groups with a greater variety of malignancies is recommended to strengthen these results.""","""['Matthias N van Oosterom', 'Philippa Meershoek', 'Gijs H KleinJan', 'Kees Hendricksen', 'Nassir Navab', 'Cornelis J H van de Velde', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Feasibility of intraoperative navigation to the sentinel node in the groin using preoperatively acquired single photon emission computerized tomography data: transferring functional imaging to the operating room.', 'Intraoperative laparoscopic fluorescence guidance to the sentinel lymph node in prostate cancer patients: clinical proof of concept of an integrated functional imaging approach using a multimodal tracer.', 'Navigation of a robot-integrated fluorescence laparoscope in preoperative SPECT/CT and intraoperative freehand SPECT imaging data: a phantom study.', '3D scintigraphic imaging and navigation in radioguided surgery: freehand SPECT technology and its clinical applications.', 'Contribution of SPECT/CT imaging to radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer, melanoma, and other solid cancers: from ""open and see"" to ""see and open"".', 'The current status and future prospects for molecular imaging-guided precision surgery.', 'Precision surgery: the role of intra-operative real-time image guidance - outcomes from a multidisciplinary European consensus conference.', 'Augmented reality in open surgery.']"""

Materials and methods:   A query of the Cryo On-Line Database (COLD) registry for men who underwent primary focal prostate cryoablation revealed 829 patients with complete data. The impact of TPV on oncologic outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and post-cryoablation biopsy outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox and logistic regression models.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 25.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 12.7-48.2 months). The median age at time of treatment was 68 years (IQR, 63-74 years) with median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 5.6 ng/mL (IQR, 4.4-7.5 ng/mL), and median TPV 35 mL (IQR, 26.5-46 mL). PFS was achieved in 83.2%, with positive post-cryoablation biopsy detected in 81 (35.7%) of 228 patients. Higher TPV was associated with higher biochemical progression (BP) using the Phoenix definition (39 vs. 34.5 mL; P = .003) and was an independent predictor of BP (hazard ratio, 1.01; P = .02). Conversely, men who had a positive post-cryoablation biopsy had significantly smaller median TPV on univariate and multivariate analyses (31 vs. 39 mL; P < .001), (odds ratio, 0.97; P = .001), respectively. Higher median pretreatment PSA density was associated with higher BP (0.18 vs. 0.16; P = .005) and positive post-cryoablation biopsy rates (0.2 vs. 0.16; P = .003).  Conclusion:   Prostate volume has contradictory effects on BP and post-cryoablation biopsy outcome in men who underwent primary focal prostate cryoablation. Remnant viable tissue in larger prostates continues to produce more PSA over time, which may impact BP. This may raise the need to develop a new definition for oncologic success following focal gland therapy rather than the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and Phoenix definitions.""","""['Ahmed Elshafei', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'Onder Kara', 'Ercan Malkoc', 'Yaw Nyame', 'Hans Arora', 'Asmaa Hatem', 'Sahil A Patel', 'Franco Lugnani', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Focal cryotherapy for prostate cancer: a contemporary literature review.', 'Comparison of Outcomes Between Preoperatively Potent Men Treated with Focal Versus Whole Gland Cryotherapy in a Matched Population.', 'Single center experience with third-generation cryosurgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of short-term outcomes, complications, and patient quality of life.', 'Primary full-gland prostate cryoablation in older men (> age of 75 years): results from 860 patients tracked with the COLD Registry.', 'Review of primary and salvage cryoablation for prostate cancer.', 'Cryotherapy for partial gland ablation of prostate cancer: Oncologic and safety outcomes.', 'Focal cryotherapy for prostate cancer: a contemporary literature review.', 'Cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, irreversible electroporation, and vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Anterior gland focal cryoablation: proof-of-concept primary prostate cancer treatment in select men with localized anterior cancers detected by multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Patients and methods:   We enrolled 77 patients who had received no prior chemotherapy for CRPC between 1998 and 2000; a total of 74 subjects were eligible for the study. Each 8-week cycle included paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 provided intravenously weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off therapy and oral estramustine 280 mg twice daily for 3 days beginning 24 hours before the first dose of paclitaxel. The primary end point was rate of objective or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response at 16 weeks. A 50% response rate was considered of further interest.  Results:   Eligible patients received a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-10 cycles). The response rate among patients with measurable disease was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19-52). The PSA response rate was 58% (95% CI, 47-70). Clinical benefit rate was 45% (95% CI, 33-57). The median progression-free survival was 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-6.7). The median overall survival was 17.6 months (95% CI, 14.6-20.8). The most common clinical grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue (14%) and sensory neuropathy (7%). Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities included lymphopenia (21%) and anemia (9%). There was one toxicity-related death.

Miscalibration-simulated log files were generated by inducing a linac component miscalibration into the log file. Miscalibration magnitudes for leaf, gantry, and collimator at the general tolerance level were ¬±0.5mm, ¬±1¬∞, and ¬±1¬∞, respectively, and at a tighter tolerance level achievable on current linac were ¬±0.3mm, ¬±0.5¬∞, and ¬±0.5¬∞, respectively. Re-calculations were performed on patient anatomy using log file data.  Results:   Changes in tumor control probability/normal tissue complication probability from treatment planning system dose to re-calculated dose at the general tolerance level was 1.8% on planning target volume (PTV) and 2.4% on organs at risk (OARs) in both plans. These changes at the tighter tolerance level were improved to 1.0% on PTV and to 1.5% on OARs, with a statistically significant difference.
