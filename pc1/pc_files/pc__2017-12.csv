Methods:   This was an IRB-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. Peripheral zone PI-RADS 4 observations prospectively identified at the study institution from 8/1/2015 to 12/31/2016 (n = 170 in 149 mpMRIs) were reviewed independently by two blinded genitourinary radiologists on the basis of (a) PI-RADS v2 shape, (b) pattern of peripheral zone sparing, and (c) rationale for PI-RADS 4 designation. Reference standard was targeted MR-ultrasound fusion biopsy and detection of Gleason 7+ prostate cancer. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated. Predictors were assessed with binary logistic regression.  Results:   PI-RADS 4 lesions with a DWI score of 4 were more likely to represent Gleason 7+ prostate cancer (p = 0.008-0.01; Reader 1 PPV: 53%; Reader 2 PPV: 48%). Pattern of peripheral zone sparing and most lesion shapes were not predictive (p > 0.05); however, oval lesions were predictive for Reader 1 (PPV = 59%, p = 0.03) and lentiform lesions were predictive for Reader 2 (PPV = 74%, p = 0.01). Lesions scored as ""not meeting PI-RADS 4 criteria"" had significantly lower PPV (p = 0.016-0.003; Reader 1 PPV: 14%, Reader 2 PPV: 16%).  Discussion:   Peripheral zone PI-RADS 4 lesions with a DWI score of 4 are more likely Gleason 7+ cancer than those with a DWI score of 3. Lesions overcalled as PI-RADS 4 have PPV similar to published PI-RADS 3 data. Lesion shape and peripheral zone sparing in general do not predict Gleason 7+ cancer within PI-RADS 4 observations.""","""['Prasad R Shankar', 'Nicole E Curci', 'Matthew S Davenport']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Comparison of PI-RADS version 2 and PI-RADS version 2.1 for the detection of transition zone prostate cancer.', 'Predictive value of PI-RADS classification in MRI-directed transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of PI-RADS v1 and v2 for multiparametric MRI detection of prostate cancer with whole-mount histological workup as reference standard.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'PI-RADS Version 2: A Pictorial Update.', 'Multiparametric MRI Features and Pathologic Outcome of Wedge-Shaped Lesions in the Peripheral Zone on T2-Weighted Images of the Prostate.']"""

Seven case-control studies of DNA methylation and colorectal, gastric, kidney, lung, prostate and urothelial cancer and B-cell lymphoma nested in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study were conducted. Cancer cases, vital status and cause of death were ascertained through linkage with cancer and death registries. Conditional logistic regression and Cox models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of five age acceleration measures derived from the Human Methylation 450 K Beadchip assay with cancer risk (N = 3,216 cases) and survival (N = 1,726 deaths), respectively. Epigenetic aging was associated with increased cancer risk, ranging from 4% to 9% per five-year age acceleration for the 5 measures considered. Heterogeneity by study was observed, with stronger associations for risk of kidney cancer and B-cell lymphoma. An associated increased risk of death following cancer diagnosis ranged from 2% to 6% per five-year age acceleration, with no evidence of heterogeneity by cancer site. Cancer risk and mortality were increased by 15-30% for the fourth versus first quartile of age acceleration.

HSP70-induced interleukin (IL)-6 promotes IL-17 expression and causes rejection of established prostate tumours. However, it remains unclear whether HS-TEXs exhibit antitumour effects by converting regulatory T cells (Tregs ) into T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. In this study, we found that compared with TEXs, HS-TEXs were more potent in stimulating secretion of IL-6 from dendritic cells. In vitro, IL-6 blocked tumour cell-derived transforming growth factor beta 1-induced Treg differentiation and promoted Th17 cell differentiation. HS-TEXs exerted strong antitumour effects, converting Tregs into Th17 cells with high efficiency, a process that was entirely dependent upon IL-6. Neutralization of IL-17 completely abolished the antitumour effect of TEXs, but only partially inhibited that of HS-TEXs. In addition, we found higher levels of IL-6 and IL-17 in serum from tumour patients treated with hyperthermia, and an increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in Tregs was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from these patients after hyperthermia. Therefore, our results demonstrate that HS-TEXs possess a powerful capacity to convert immunosuppressive Tregs into Th17 cells via IL-6, which contributes to their potent antitumour effect.""","""['Danfeng Guo', 'Yinghu Chen', 'Shoujie Wang', 'Lei Yu', 'Yingying Shen', 'Haijun Zhong', 'Yunshan Yang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Immunology""","""['Exosomes Derived from Dendritic Cells Attenuate Liver Injury by Modulating the Balance of Treg and Th17 Cells After Ischemia Reperfusion.', 'Immune modulation of T-cell and NK (natural killer) cell activities by TEXs (tumour-derived exosomes).', 'Heterogeneity of Treg/Th17 According to Cancer Progression and Modification in Biliary Tract Cancers via Self-Producing Cytokines.', 'Dual effect of DLBCL-derived EXOs in lymphoma to improve DC vaccine efficacy in vitro while favor tumorgenesis in vivo.', 'Treg programming and therapeutic reprogramming in cancer.', 'Abscopal Effect, Extracellular Vesicles and Their Immunotherapeutic Potential in Cancer Treatment.', 'Leveraging Exosomes as the Next-Generation Bio-Shuttles: The Next Biggest Approach against Th17 Cell Catastrophe.', 'Caveolin-1 Promotes the Imbalance of Th17/Treg in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease by Regulating Hsp70 Expression.', 'Interplay between Signaling Pathways and Tumor Microenvironment Components: A Paradoxical Role in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer Immunoediting and Their Potential as Oncoimmunotherapeutics.']"""

The aim of this study was to identify oncogenic genes and pathways in PCa cells that were regulated by antitumor miR-205-5p. Genome-wide gene expression analyses and in silico miRNA database searches showed that 37 genes were putative targets of miR-205-5p regulation. Among those genes, elevated expression levels of seven in particular (HMGB3, SPARC, MKI67, CENPF, CDK1, RHOU, and POLR2D) were associated with a shorter disease-free survival in a large number of patients in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We focused on high-mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) because it was the most downregulated by ectopic expression of miR-205-5p in PC3 cells and its expression was involved in PCa pathogenesis. Luciferase reporter assays showed that HMGB3 was directly regulated by miR-205-5p in PCa cells. Knockdown studies using si-HMGB3 showed that expression of HMGB3 enhanced PCa cell aggressiveness.

To address this paradox, we determined the intrinsic specificities of the AR and GR DNA-binding domains using a refined version of SELEX-seq. We developed an algorithm, SelexGLM, that quantifies binding specificity over a large (31-bp) binding site by iteratively fitting a feature-based generalized linear model to SELEX probe counts. This analysis revealed that the DNA-binding preferences of AR and GR homodimers differ significantly, both within and outside the 15-bp core binding site. The relative preference between the two factors can be tuned over a wide range by changing the DNA sequence, with AR more sensitive to sequence changes than GR. The specificity of AR extends to the regions flanking the core 15-bp site, where isothermal calorimetry measurements reveal that affinity is augmented by enthalpy-driven readout of poly(A) sequences associated with narrowed minor groove width. We conclude that the increased specificity of AR is correlated with more enthalpy-driven binding than GR.

Results:   Twenty of 31 (65%) experienced positive clinically meaningful improvement changes on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, and 25 (81%) of 31 on the Prostate Cancer Subscale. Eighteen (58%) of 31 demonstrated reduced pain intensity and 12 (39%) of 31 demonstrated reduction of pain interference in their lives. At baseline, subjects averaged 11.6 ± 2.8 bone lesions; at the end of treatment, subjects averaged 5.6 ± 2.4 bone lesions (P = .0002). The most frequent AEs were diarrhea (17%), nausea (17%), and fatigue (14%). There were 6 serious AEs; 1 led to study withdrawal.  Conclusions:   Patients experienced clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life and pain, without unexpected adverse toxicities.

Whereas, its biological effects on prostate cancer (PC) are less understood. To investigate the functional mechanism of CDKN3 in PC, we examined the expression of CDKN3 in PC tissues and analyzed the disease free survival time of patients. We then transfected LNCaP and PC3 cells with siRNA-CDKN3 to silence CDKN3, and transfected 22RV1 and VCaP cells with full length CDKN3 cDNA for CDKN3 over-expression. Cell growth of these transfected cells were analyzed using CCK-8 assay. And transfected LNCaP and PC3 cells were further submitted to cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and endogenous protein expression assays. We found that CDKN3 was highly expressed in PC and negatively correlated with disease relapse. And CDKN3 positively control the cell proliferation in prostate carcinoma cell lines. Knockdown of CDKN3 significantly promoted G1 phase arrest, elevated apoptosis rates, and suppressed cell invasion in both LNCaP and PC3 cells. Moreover, in vivo data showed that knockdown of CDKN3 expression dramatically inhibited the PC3 tumor growth in nude mouse model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that cell cycle and DNA replication signaling were related with elevated CDKN3 expression. And results of western blot showed that the depletion of CDKN3 down-regulated the expression levels of cell cycle- and DNA replication-related proteins.

Objective:   To determine whether multiparametric pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) performed for biochemical recurrence after RP improves prognostication of sXRT relative to the Stephenson nomogram.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men undergoing RP at our institution from 2003 to 2012 who had biochemical recurrence evaluated by mpMRI within 12 mo of sXRT were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria included PCa treatment prior to RP, adjuvant XRT after RP, salvage cryotherapy before sXRT, and hormone refractory disease prior to sXRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable Cox regression analyses (adjusting for Stephenson nomogram covariates) associated mpMRI findings with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence and metastasis after sXRT. The mpMR images were compared in a binary fashion: no lesion versus vesicourethral/seminal vesical bed/prostate fossa lesions.  Results and limitations:   Among 473 sXRT patients, 57%(204) had lesions on mpMRI: 26%(124) vesicourethral, 28%(135) seminal vesical bed/prostatic fossa, 7%(34) nodal, and 1%(3) bone. Median PSA at mpMRI with lesions was 0.46 versus 0.40ng/ml without lesions. After excluding nodal/bone lesions, 29% of men developed PSA recurrence and 14% metastasis (median follow-up 45 mo after sXRT). For patients with a pre-sXRT PSA of ≤0.5ng/ml, negative mpMRI was associated with increased PSA recurrence (39% vs 12%, p<0.01) and metastasis (16% vs 2%, p<0.01) at 4 yr after sXRT. For patients with a PSA of ≤0.5ng/ml, the addition of mpMRI to the propensity score (created using variables from the original Stephenson nomogram) improved the c-statistic from 0.71 to 0.77 for PSA recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.60, p<0.01) and from 0.66 to 0.77 for metastasis (HR 6.68, p<0.01). Limitations include evolutions in MRI technique and lack of a cohort of men undergoing mpMRI electing against sXRT.  Conclusions:   Pre-sXRT mpMRI improves clinicopathologic variables to estimate sXRT success, particularly in the early sXRT setting.

Method:   DIR was applied to 20 HDRPBT patients' planning CT images who received two treatment fractions on sequential days, on two different CT datasets, with the same implant. Quality of DIR in Velocity and MIM image registration systems was assessed by calculating the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and mean distance to agreement (MDA) for the prostate, urethra and rectum contours. Accumulated doses from each system were then calculated using the same DIR technique and dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters compared to manual addition with no DIR.  Results:   The average DSC was found to be 0.83 (Velocity) and 0.84 (MIM), 0.80 (Velocity) and 0.80 (MIM), 0.80 (Velocity) and 0.81 (MIM), for the prostate, rectum and urethra contours, respectively. The average difference in calculated DVH parameters between the two systems using dose accumulation was less than 1%, and there was no statistically significant difference found between deformably accumulated doses in the two systems versus manual DVH addition with no DIR.  Conclusion:   Contour propagation using DIR in velocity and MIM was shown to be at least equivalent to inter-observer contouring variability on CT.

We aimed to assess prevalence of and predictors of penile morphometric alterations (i.e. penile shortening or penile morphometric deformation) at long-term follow-up in patients submitted to either robot-assisted (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy) or open radical prostatectomy. Sexually active patients after either robot-assisted radical prostatectomy or open radical prostatectomy prospectively completed a 28-item questionnaire, with sensitive issues regarding sexual function, namely orgasmic functioning, climacturia and changes in morphometric characteristics of the penis. Only patients with a post-operative follow-up ≥ 24 months were included. Patients submitted to either adjuvant or salvage therapies or those who refused to comprehensively complete the questionnaire were excluded from the analyses. A propensity-score matching analysis was implemented to control for baseline differences between groups. Logistic regression models tested potential predictors of penile morphometric alterations at long-term post-operative follow-up. Overall, 67 (50%) and 67 (50%) patients were included after open radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, respectively. Self-rated post-operative penile shortening and penile morphometric deformation were reported by 75 (56%) and 29 (22.8%) patients, respectively. Rates of penile shortening and penile morphometric deformation were not different after open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy [all p > 0.5].

At multivariable analysis, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was independently associated with a lower risk of post-operative penile morphometric alterations (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.16-0.93).

Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between dietary factors and these symptoms among men with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, there are limited data on whether diet after prostate cancer diagnosis, including a Mediterranean dietary pattern, affects urinary and sexual function among prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 2960) from 1986 to 2012 were prospectively followed for a median of 8.3 years after treatment. Participants completed validated dietary questionnaires every 4 years and a health-related quality of life assessment in 2010 or 2012. We used generalized linear models to examine associations between post-diagnosis Mediterranean Diet Score (including individual score components and dietary fat subtypes) and quality of life domains (sexual functioning, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence) assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (score 0-100; higher scores indicate better function).  Results:   No statistically significant relationships were observed between the Mediterranean Diet Score after prostate cancer diagnosis and urinary or sexual function. However, the associations did vary depending on pre-diagnosis urinary and sexual dysfunction for urinary irritation/obstruction and sexual function scores, respectively (P-interactions < 0.0001). Men with higher post-diagnosis vegetable intake reported higher urinary incontinence scores (72 vs 76 comparing lowest to highest quintile; P-trend = 0.003). Similarly, higher vegetable intake and lower polyunsaturated fat intake were associated with higher urinary irritation/obstruction scores (vegetable: 80 vs 84 comparing lowest to highest quintile, P-trend = 0.01; polyunsaturated fat: 84 vs 78 comparing lowest to highest quintile, P-trend = 0.005), however these associations were observed only among men with urinary symptoms prior to their prostate cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Among men with prostate cancer, diet intake after diagnosis was not significantly associated with urinary or sexual function, although some relationships appeared to differ among men with and without symptoms prior to their prostate cancer diagnosis. Higher vegetable intake and lower polyunsaturated fat intake after prostate cancer diagnosis may be associated with better urinary function.

ADT influences steroidal metabolism in patients with PC and promotes the accumulation of carbon 21 steroids (C21s), such as progestin. Because the enzymes responsible for C21s metabolism are similar to those for androgen metabolism, PC cells may be able to metabolize C21s intracellularly. Therefore, there is a possibility that intracrine C21s are implicated in PC progression and resistance to ADT, and the influence of C21s on PC cells is yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we focused on 20β-hydroxy-5α-dihydroprogesterone (20β-OHDHP), a C21s metabolized from progestin, and showed that 20β-OHDHP is synthesized in PC cells and is able to directly stimulate the androgen receptor (AR).  Methods:   LNCaP, VCaP, and DU145 cells, which express a mutant AR (mAR), wild-type AR (wAR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), respectively, were incubated in the presence of several agents. After incubation, cell growth was determined by the MTS assay. PSA levels were determined by an enzyme immunoassay, and C21s and androgen levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and steroidal-receptor-related signaling was determined by a reporter assay.  Results:   We affirmed that 20β-OHDHP was synthesized from pregnenolone intracellularly in LNCaP and VCaP cells, and 20β-OHDHP significantly promoted the growth of both cell lines without androgen conversion. 20β-OHDHP directly stimulated both mAR and wAR. The presence of 20β-OHDHP was sufficient for the proliferation and survival of LNCaP or VCaP cells, and 20β-OHDHP promoted cell growth even in the presence of abiraterone. Using DU145 cells, we affirmed that 20β-OHDHP did not stimulate GR, which has a potential to bypass AR signaling in PC cells promote PC cell growth.  Conclusions:   Under ADT, 20β-OHDHP synthesized intracellularly from accumulated progestin in PC cells may accelerate cell growth via stimulation of both wAR and mAR.

CaP cell lines are used to identify and characterize new agents for ADT or investigate mechanisms of ADT resistance. CaP cell lines are maintained in culture medium that contains fetal bovine serum, which contains testosterone (T). Androgen deprivation experiments are performed using media supplemented with androgen-free serum, such as charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FBS). However, CS-FBS composition varies from batch-to-batch and variations may impact experimental reproducibility. Serum free media (SFM) may provide a better defined alternative to media supplemented with CS-FBS (CSM).  Methods:   Cell growth of six human CaP cell lines was assessed using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Androgen levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  Results:   MTT assays showed 5 of 6 CaP cell lines grew after 6 days of culture in androgen- deprived SFM or CSM. LNCaP and VCaP growth was stimulated when cells were cultured in SFM or CSM supplemented with T. LNCaP, C4-2, LAPC-4, and VCaP cell growth was inhibited when cultured in SFM or CSM with T and bicalutamide. LC-MS/MS data showed LAPC-4 cells produced similar DHT levels when cultured in T-supplemented SFM or CSM. Dutasteride impaired T to DHT metabolism in LAPC-4.  Conclusions:   Media composition contributed to growth differences observed between CaP cells cultured in SFM or CSM. However, the differences in media composition did not impair CaP cell response to T-stimulated growth, bicalutamide growth inhibition, metabolism of T, or dutasteride efficiency. SFM can be used as a better defined alternative to CSM for androgen deprivation experiments.""","""['Michael V Fiandalo', 'John H Wilton', 'Krystin M Mantione', 'Carol Wrzosek', 'Kristopher M Attwood', 'Yue Wu', 'James L Mohler']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Proteomic Analysis of Charcoal-Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum Reveals Changes in the Insulin-like Growth Factor Signaling Pathway.', 'Androgen deprivation induces selective outgrowth of aggressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer clones expressing distinct cellular and molecular properties not present in parental androgen-dependent cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of proliferation and expression of AR/PSA by herbal supplement Equiguard in LNCaP cells cultured in androgen-proficient FBS and androgen-deficient charcoal-stripped FBS is correlated with increased serine-15 phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor gene p53.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Roles for the backdoor pathway of androgen metabolism in prostate cancer response to castration and drug treatment.', 'SLX4IP Promotes Telomere Maintenance in Androgen Receptor-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through ALT-like Telomeric PML Localization.', 'Recapitulation of prostate tissue cell type-specific transcriptomes by an in vivo primary prostate tissue xenograft model.', 'Adrenal androgens rescue prostatic dihydrotestosterone production and growth of prostate cancer cells after castration.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Charcoal-Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum Reveals Changes in the Insulin-like Growth Factor Signaling Pathway.']"""

Accumulation of NPs in tumors results from different mechanisms, and appears extremely heterogeneous in mice models and rather limited in humans. Developing new tumor models in mice, with their low spontaneous NP accumulation, is thus necessary for screening imaging probes and for testing new targeting strategies. In the present work, accumulation of LipImageTM 815, a non-specific nanosized fluorescent imaging agent, was compared in subcutaneous, orthotopic and metastatic tumors of RM1 cells (murine prostate cancer cell line) by in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging techniques. LipImageTM 815 mainly accumulated in liver at 24 h but also in orthotopic tumors. Limited accumulation occurred in subcutaneous tumors, and very low fluorescence was detected in metastasis. Altogether, these different tumor models in mice offered a wide range of NP accumulation levels, and a panel of in vivo models that may be useful to further challenge NP targeting properties.""","""['Coralie Genevois', 'Arnaud Hocquelet', 'Claire Mazzocco', 'Emilie Rustique', 'Franck Couillaud', 'Nicolas Grenier']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Impact of surface grafting density of PEG macromolecules on dually fluorescent silica nanoparticles used for the in vivo imaging of subcutaneous tumors.', 'Theranostic imaging of liver cancer using targeted optical/MRI dual-modal probes.', 'Evaluation of four affibody-based near-infrared fluorescent probes for optical imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor positive tumors.', 'Fluorescent nanoparticle probes for imaging of cancer.', 'Fluorescent nanoparticles for the accurate detection of drug delivery.', 'Multimodal optical contrast agents as new tools for monitoring and tuning nanoemulsion internalisation into cancer cells.

We undertook this study to identify gaps in prostate cancer care quality, racial disparities in care, and underlying reasons for poorer quality care.  Methods:   We identified all black men and random age-matched white men with Gleason scores ≥ 7 diagnosed between 2006 and 2013 at two urban hospitals to determine rates of treatment underuse. Underuse was defined as not receiving primary surgery, cryotherapy, or radiotherapy. We then interviewed treating physicians about the reasons for underuse.  Results:   Of 359 black and 282 white men, only 25 (4%) experienced treatment underuse, and 23 (92%) of these were black. Most (78%) cases of underuse were due to system failures, where treatment was recommended but not received; 38% of these men continued receiving care at the hospitals. All men with treatment underuse due to system failures were black.  Conclusion:   Treatment rates of prostate cancer are high. Yet, racial disparities in rates and causes of underuse remain. Only black men experienced system failures, a type of underuse amenable to health information technology-based solutions.

Methods:   BPH patients (n = 43) and control patients with localized prostate cancer (PC; n = 57) were imaged by mSUG before surgery. Using the seminal colliculus as a landmark, prostatic urethral angulation (PUA), sagittal urethral diameter, and anterior or posterior prostatic urethral length were measured. The International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) was also evaluated in all patients. The Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI) was measured in BPH patients that could void in a pressure-flow study. Parameters were compared between BPH and PC patients, and correlations among morphological and clinical parameters were evaluated.  Results:   Prostatic urethras were clearly observed in all patients by mSUG. PUA, sagittal urethral diameter, and posterior urethral length were all greater in BPH than PC patients (P < .05). Among all parameters examined, PUA had the strongest correlation with IPSS (r = 0.56). Longitudinal urethral diameter showed the strongest correlation with BOOI, whereas PUA was not correlated with BOOI.  Conclusions:   Prostatic urethral morphology can be imaged precisely by mSUG. Morphometric measurements showed that increased PUA was strongly correlated with problematic urinary symptoms, and a flattened shape of the posterior urethra, such as extension of the sagittal urethral diameter, was correlated with urinary tract obstruction by BPH.""","""['Tomonori Minagawa', 'Hironori Daimon', 'Noriyuki Ogawa', 'Tetsuichi Saito', 'Toshiro Suzuki', 'Takahisa Domen', 'Takashi Nagai', 'Teruyuki Ogawa', 'Osamu Ishizuka']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Low Urin Tract Symptoms""","""['Correlation between prostatic urethral angle and bladder outlet obstruction index in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Evaluation of resistive index of the prostate and bladder sonomorphologic parameters as replacements for urodynamics to predict bladder outlet obstruction in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The relationship between intravesical prostatic protrusion and pressure flow study findings in patients with benign prostate obstruction/lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Application of ultrasonography and the resistive index for evaluating bladder outlet obstruction in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'What is a disease?

Methods:   A single-surgeon RARP database of 1082 men who underwent prospective UF testing was analyzed. Men filled out International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaires and underwent uroflowmetry and post-void bladder ultrasound before surgery and at each follow-up visit. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on preoperative PFR: those with PFR <10 mL/s (n = 158) and those with PFR ≥10 mL/s (n = 924). Univariate and multivariate regression models tested the association of preoperative characteristics in predicting postoperative PFR improvement. Within the PFR <10 mL/s group, preoperative variables were analyzed to predict pathologic outcomes.  Results:   Three months after RARP, men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s had a 3-fold improvement in PFR (from mean of 7.0 to 24.2 mL/s), whereas in men with PFR ≥10 mL/s there was a 50% improvement (from mean of 19.7 to 28.9 mL/s; P < .001). Improvement in PFR remained stable for >5 years, but mean postoperative PFR was 20% lower in men with baseline PFR <10 mL/s.

Preoperative PFR ≤7 mL/s was an independent predictor of Gleason score ≥8 (P = .016), seminal vesicle invasion (P = .010), and lymph node invasion (0.029).

Although larger markers provide better visualization on MRI, they tend to generate artifacts on CT. MRI is strongly influenced by the presence of metals, such as iron, in the body. Here we compared efficacies of a 0.5% iron-containing gold marker (GM) and a traditional non-iron-containing marker.  Methods:   Twenty-seven patients underwent CT/MRI fusion-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Markers were placed by urologists under local anesthesia. Gold Anchor (GA; diameter: 0.28 mm; length: 10 mm), an iron-containing marker, was placed on the right side of the prostate using a 22-G needle and VISICOIL (VIS; diameter: 0.35 mm; length: 10 mm), a non-iron-containing marker, was placed on the left side using a 19-G needle. T2*-weighted images MRI sequences were obtained. Two radiation oncologists and a radiation technologist evaluated and assigned scores for visual quality on a five-point scale (1, poor; 5, best visibility).  Results:   Artifact generation on CT was slightly greater with GA than with VIS. The mean marker visualization scores on MRI of all three observers were significantly superior for GA than for VIS (3.5 vs 3.2, 3.9 vs 3.2, and 4.0 vs 2.9). The actual size of the spherical GA was about 2 mm in diameter, but the signal void on MRI was approximately 5 mm.  Conclusion:   Although both markers were well visualized and can be recommended clinically, the results suggest that GA has some subtle advantages for quantitative visualization that could prove useful in certain situations of stereotactic body radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.""","""['Osamu Tanaka', 'Hisao Komeda', 'Shigeki Hirose', 'Takuya Taniguchi', 'Kousei Ono', 'Masayuki Matsuo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Comparison of MRI visualization between linearly placed iron-containing and non-iron-containing fiducial markers for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Fiducial marker for prostate radiotherapy: comparison of 0.35- and 0.5-mm-diameter computed tomography and magnetic resonance images.', 'Quantification of fiducial marker visibility for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy simulation.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Comparison of image-guided radiotherapy technologies for prostate cancer.', 'Determining a reliably visible and inexpensive surface fiducial marker for use in MRI: a research study in a busy Australian Radiology Department.']"""

We combined a v-type valve and peristaltic pumping to select individual cells from a pool of prostate cancer cells (PC3) and place them successively in separate cell chambers in which they were exposed to the drug. Six different concentrations of doxorubicin, a naturally fluorescent anti-cancer drug, were created in loop-shaped reactors and exposed to the cell in closed 2 nL volume chambers. Monitoring every single cell over time in 18 parallel chambers revealed increased intracellular fluorescence intensity according to the dose of doxorubicin, as well as nuclear localization of the fluorescent drug after 2 h of incubation.

Thus, we decided to evaluate the possible correlation between rPCa and these lesions as possible hepatic metastases.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively enrolled 542 patients diagnosed with rPCa in biochemical relapse after a radical treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy). Among these, patients with a second tumor or other benign hepatic diseases were excluded. All patients underwent 11C-Choline PET/CT during the standard restaging workup of their disease. We analyzed CT images to evaluate the presence of hypodense lesions and PET images to identify the relative tracer uptake. In accordance to the subsequent oncological history, five clinical scenarios were recognized [Table 1]: normal low dose CT (ldCT) and normal tracer distribution (Group A); evidence of previously unknown hepatic round hypodense areas at ldCT with normal rim uptake (Group B); evidence of previously known hepatic round hypodense areas at ldCT stable over time and with normal rim uptake (Group C); evidence of previously known hepatic round hypodense areas at ldCT, in a previous PET/CT scan, with or without rim uptake and significantly changing over time in terms of size and/or uptake (Group D); evidence of hepatic round hypodense areas at ldCT with or without rim uptake confirmed as prostate liver metastases by histopathology, triple phase ceCT, ce-ultra sound (CEUS) and clinical/biochemical evaluation (Group E). We evaluated the correlation with PSA level at time of scan, rim SUVmax and association with local relapse or non-hepatic metastases (lymph nodes, bone, other parenchyma).  Results:   Five hundred and forty-two consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled. In 140 of the 542 patients more than one 11C-choline PET/CT had been performed. A total of 742 11C-Choline PET/CT scans were analyzed. Of the 542 patients enrolled, 456 (84.1%) had a normal appearance of the liver both at ldCT and PET (Group A). 19/542 (3,5%) belonged to Group B, 13/542 (2.4%) to Group C, 37/542 (6.8%) to Group D and 18/542 (3.3%) to Group E. Mean SUVmax of the rim was: 4.5 for Group B; 4.2 for Group C; 4.8 for Group D; 5.9 for Group E. Mean PSA level was 5.27 for Group A, 7.9 for Group B, 10.04 for Group C, 10.01 for Group D, 9.36 for Group E. Presence of positive findings at 11C-Choline PET/CT in any further anatomical area (local relapse, lymph node, bone, other extra hepatic sites) correlated with an higher PSA (p = 0.0285). In both the univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses. PSA, SUVmax of the rim, local relapse, positive nodes were not associated to liver mets (Groups D-E) (p > 0.05). On the contrary, a significant correlation was found between the presence of liver metG (group D-E) and bone lesions (p= 0.00193).  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that liver metastases in relapsing prostate cancer may occur frequently. The real incidence evaluation needs more investigations. In this case and despite technical limitations, Choline PET/CT shows alterations of tracer distribution within the liver that could eventually be mistaken for simple cysts but can be suspected when associated to high trigger PSA, concomitant bone lesions or modification over time.

Objective:   To examine trends in cancer survival by health insurance status from January 1997 to December 2014.  Design, setting, and participants:   California Cancer Registry (a statewide cancer surveillance system) data were used to estimate population-based survival by health insurance status in 3 calendar periods: January 1997 to December 2002, January 2003 to December 2008, and January 2009 to December 2014 with follow-up through 2014. Overall, 1 149 891 patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer, or melanoma in California were included in the study.  Main outcomes and measures:   Five-year all-cause and cancer-specific survival probabilities by insurance category and calendar period for each cancer site and sex; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each insurance category (none, Medicare, other public) compared with private insurance in each calendar period.  Results:   According to data from 1 149 891 patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer, or melanoma gathered from the California Cancer Registry, improvements in survival were almost exclusively limited to patients with private or Medicare insurance. For patients with other public or no insurance, survival was largely unchanged or declined. Relative to privately insured patients, cancer-specific mortality was higher in uninsured patients for all cancers except prostate, and disparities were largest from 2009 to 2014 for breast (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.45-2.03), lung (men: HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.31 and women: HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50), and colorectal cancer (women: HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62). Mortality was also higher for patients with other public insurance for all cancers except lung, and disparities were largest from 2009 to 2014 for breast (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.34), prostate (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31), and colorectal cancer (men: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.23 and women: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20).  Conclusions and relevance:   After accounting for patient and clinical characteristics, survival disparities for men with prostate cancer and women with lung or colorectal cancer increased significantly over time, reflecting a lack of improvement in survival for patients with other public or no insurance. To mitigate these growing disparities, all patients with cancer need access to health insurance that covers all the necessary elements of health care, from prevention and early detection to timely treatment according to clinical guidelines.""","""['Libby Ellis', 'Alison J Canchola', 'David Spiegel', 'Uri Ladabaum', 'Robert Haile', 'Scarlett Lin Gomez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Efficacy of Medicaid for Patients With Cancer in California.', 'Understanding the Limitations of Cancer Registry Insurance Data-Implications for Policy-Reply.', 'Understanding the Limitations of Cancer Registry Insurance Data-Implications for Policy.', 'Cancer survival disparities by health insurance status.', 'Impact of insurance type and timing of Medicaid enrollment on survival among adolescents and young adults with cancer.', 'Disparities in Systemic Treatment Use in Advanced-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer by Source of Health Insurance.', 'An official American Thoracic Society systematic review: insurance status and disparities in lung cancer practices and outcomes.', 'Lifetime Consequences of Early-Life and Midlife Access to Health Insurance: A Review.', 'The Uninsured are a Distinct Population in a Breast Cancer Cohort, with Unique Screening, Staging, and Outcomes.', 'Treatment Disparities in Radiation and Hormone Therapy Among Women Covered by Medicaid vs Private Insurance in Cancer Registry and Claims Data.', 'Five-year survivors from brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery: Biology, improving treatments, or just plain luck?', 'An Exploratory Analysis of Differential Prescribing of High-Risk Opioids by Insurance Type Among Patients Seen by the Same Clinician.', 'Traumatic spinal cord injury in West Virginia: Impact on long-term outcomes by insurance status and discharge disposition.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the association between enzalutamide-induced NED and TAMs and its mechanism.Experimental Design: The association between enzalutamide-induced NED and TAMs was investigated by IHC using prostate cancer tissues, enzalutamide-resistant mouse xenografts, and a coculture system. The underlying mechanisms were assessed using in vitro cytokine antibody arrays, ELISAs, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other methods. An orthotopic prostate cancer mouse model was established to evaluate the in vivo effects of combined IL6 receptor (IL6R) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) inhibition on enzalutamide resistance.Results: High CD163 expression was observed in ADT-treated prostate cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues with high levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (CHGA) and in enzalutamide-resistant xenografts, indicating the crucial roles of NED and TAMs in enzalutamide resistance. Specifically, enzalutamide-induced HMGB1 expression facilitated TAM recruitment and polarization and drove NED via β-catenin stabilization. HMGB1-activated TAMs secreted IL6 to augment enzalutamide-induced NED and directly promote HMGB1 transcription via STAT3. Finally, inhibition of the IL6/STAT3 pathway by tocilizumab combined with HMGB1 knockdown inhibited enzalutamide-induced resistance in an orthotopic prostate cancer mouse model.Conclusions: Enzalutamide elevates HMGB1 levels, which recruits and activates TAMs. Moreover, IL6 secreted by HMGB1-activated TAMs facilitates the enzalutamide-induced NED of prostate cancer, forming a positive feedback loop between NED in prostate cancer and TAMs. The combined inhibition of IL6R and HMGB1 may serve as a new treatment for enzalutamide resistance in patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

This work aimed at the development of dual-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors derived from the established N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED-CC)-based PET tracer 68Ga-Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11) to allow accurate intraoperative detection of PSMA-positive tumors. Methods: A series of novel PSMA-targeting fluorescent dye conjugates of Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC was synthesized, and their biologic properties were determined in cell-based assays and confocal microscopy. As a preclinical proof of concept, specific tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics, and feasibility for intraoperative fluorescence guidance were investigated in tumor-bearing mice and healthy pigs. Results: The designed dual-labeled PSMA inhibitors exhibited high binding affinity and PSMA-specific effective internalization. Conjugation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (10.86 ± 0.94 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g), IRDye800CW (13.66 ± 3.73 %ID/g), and DyLight800 (15.62 ± 5.52 %ID/g) resulted in a significantly increased specific tumor uptake, whereas 68Ga-Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC-AlexaFluor488 (9.12 ± 5.47 %ID/g) revealed a tumor uptake similar to that of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (4.89 ± 1.34 %ID/g). The first proof-of-concept studies with the clinically relevant candidate 68Ga-Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC-IRDye800CW reinforced a fast, specific enrichment in PSMA-positive tumors, with rapid background clearance. With regard to intraoperative navigation, a specific fluorescence signal was detected in PSMA-expressing tissue.

This study was performed to assess the concordance of intended patient management after NaF PET and inferred management based on analysis of Medicare claims. Methods: We analyzed linked post-NaF PET data of consenting National Oncologic PET Registry participants age 65 y or older from 2011 to 2014 and their corresponding Medicare claims. Post-NaF PET treatment plans, including combinations of 2 modes of therapy, were assessed for their concordance with clinical actions inferred from Medicare claims. NaF PET studies were stratified by indication (initial staging [IS] or suspected first osseous metastasis [FOM]) and cancer type (prostate, lung, or other cancers). Agreement was assessed between post-NaF PET intended management plans for treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy) within 90 d for lung and 180 d for prostate or other cancers, and for watching (the absence of treatment claims for ≥60 d) as compared with claims-inferred care. Results: Actions after 9,898 scans were assessed. After NaF PET for IS, there was claims agreement for planned surgery in 76.0% (19/25) lung, 75.4% (98/130) other cancers, and 58.9% (298/506) prostate cancer. Claims confirmed chemotherapy plans after NaF PET done for IS or FOM in 81.0% and 73.5% for lung cancer (n = 148 and 136) and 69.4% and 67.5% for other cancers (n = 111 and 228). For radiotherapy plans, agreement ranged from 80.0% to 84.4% after IS and 68.4% to 74.0% for suspected FOM. Concordance was greatest for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (86.0%, n = 308) alone or combined with radiotherapy in prostate cancer IS (80.8%, n = 517). In prostate FOM, the concordance across all treatment plans was lower if the patients had ADT claims within 180 d before NaF PET. Agreement with nontreatment plans was high for FOM (87.2% in other cancers and 78.6% if no prior ADT in prostate) and low after IS (40.7%-62.5%).

Methods:   We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 2439 men aged ≥65 years treated for mCRPC with abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel from 2003 to 2015 in Ontario, Canada. Our primary outcome was treatment-related toxicity, defined as hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits during mCRPC treatment. Based on toxicity profiles identified during phase III trials, we further identified specific treatment-related toxicity. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures.  Results:   Abiraterone and enzalutamide exposure were not associated with any-cause (P = .19 and .52, respectively) or treatment-related (P = .45 and .64, respectively) toxicities. In contrast, docetaxel exposure was associated with an increased risk of any-cause (HR 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.44) and treatment-related (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.33-1.74) toxicities. Cabazitaxel exposure was associated with a significant risk of treatment-related toxicity (HR 5.94, 95% CI 1.87-18.92) but not any-cause toxicity (HR 2.37, 95% CI 0.59-9.63).  Conclusion:   Among patients with mCRPC, we failed to show any increased risk of hospitalizations and ER visits for treatment-related complications for abiraterone or enzalutamide. In contrast, treatment with intravenous chemotherapeutic agents was associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and ER visits to manage these complications.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Raj Satkunasivam', 'Refik Saskin', 'Symron Bansal', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Urban Emmenegger', 'Robert K Nam']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Cabazitaxel Remains Active in Patients Progressing After Docetaxel Followed by Novel Androgen Receptor Pathway Targeted Therapies.', 'Cabazitaxel versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Initially two formulations used complexation with polycations, namely Lipofectamine 2000 and an amphiphilic polycationic cyclodextrin. Gene knockdown results for human glioblastoma cells (U87) and prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU145) showed that conjugation to the cyclodextrin did not reduce gene silencing by the RNA. A third mode of delivery involved formation of targeted nanoparticles in which the conjugate was first complexed with adamantyl-PEG-ligands (targeting ligand RVG peptide or dianisamide) by adamantyl inclusion in the cyclodextrin cavities of the conjugates, followed by charge neutralisation with the cationic polymer chitosan. Enhanced knockdown was achieved by these ligand-targeted formulations. In summary, while this study illustrated the gene silencing efficacy of a simple cyclodextrin-siRNA conjugate it is envisaged that future studies will explore the use of conjugates with a modified cyclodextrin which would be self-delivering. Detailed data such as stability, lysosomal escape etc. will then be reported for each conjugate, since this will be appropriate for conjugates which are intended to exploit, rather than merely demonstrate, the concept.

Methods and materials:   A novel mixed-integer linear programming method incorporating spatial constraints on seed locations in addition to standard dose-volume constraints was used to place seeds. The approach, described in detail elsewhere, was used to create treatment plans fully automatically on a retrospective basis for 20 patients having a wide range of prostate sizes and shapes. Corresponding manual plans used for patient treatment at a single institution were combined with the automated plans, and all 40 plans were anonymized, randomized, and independently evaluated by five clinicians using a common scoring tool. Numerical and clinical features of the plans were extracted for comparison purposes.  Results:   A full 51% of the automated plans were deemed clinically acceptable without any modification by the five practitioners collectively versus 90% of the manual plans. Automated plan seed distributions were for the most part not substantially different from those for the manual plans. Two observed shortcomings of the automated plans were seed strands not intersecting the prostate and strands extending into the bladder. Both are amenable to remediation by adjusting existing spatial constraints.  Conclusions:   After spatial and dose-volume constraints are set, the mixed-integer linear programming method is capable of creating prostate implant treatment plans fully automatically, with clinical acceptability sufficient to warrant further investigation. These plans, intended to be reviewed and refined as necessary by an expert planner, have the potential to both save planner time and enhance treatment plan consistency.""","""['Mustafa Ege Babadagli', 'John Doucette', 'Nawaid Usmani', 'John Amanie', 'Albert Murtha', 'Don Yee', 'Muhammad Jamaluddin', 'Ron S Sloboda']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A mixed-integer linear programming optimization model framework for capturing expert planning style in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Evaluation of a Machine-Learning Algorithm for Treatment Planning in Prostate Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy.', 'Dose homogeneity as a function of source activity in optimized I-125 prostate implant treatment plans.', 'Development and clinical introduction of automated radiotherapy treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'Automated treatment planning engine for prostate seed implant brachytherapy.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed the records of 62 patients with localized prostate cancer who received transperineal interstitial brachytherapy with I-125 using free seeds or IBCL seeds. Twenty-four low- and intermediate-risk patients underwent PI alone with the prescribed dose of 160 Gy, and 39 high-risk patients underwent PI with 110 Gy, followed by EBRT with 45 Gy (PI + EBRT). Intraoperative and post-implant dosimetric parameters 1 month after implantation were collected and analyzed.  Results:   The numbers of patients implanted with free seeds and IBCL seeds were 14 (58.3%) and 10 (41.7%), respectively, in the PI group and 25 (65.8%) and 13 (34.2%), respectively, in the PI + EBRT group. In the PI group, although there were significant differences in prostate V100 (p = 0.003) and D90 (p = 0.009) and rectum V100 (p = 0.026) on intraoperative dosimetry, these differences were not found on post-implant dosimetry.

Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL-3) is a phosphatase found at high levels in several cancer types, where its expression is associated with survival. A recent PC cell line study has shown it to be involved in PC growth and migration.  Methods:   We used a monoclonal antibody to evaluate the expression of PRL-3 in PC tissue of patients in an unselected cohort of 535 prostatectomy patients. We analyzed associations between PRL-3 expression and biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), clinical failure-free survival (CFFS) and PC death-free survival (PCDFS).  Results:   Cytoplasmic PRL-3 staining in tumor cells was significantly correlated to expression of molecules in the VEGFR-axis, but not to the clinicopathological variables. High PRL-3 was not significantly associated with survival in the univariate analysis for BFFS (p = 0.131), but significantly associated with CFFS (p = 0.044) and PCDFS (p = 0.041). In multivariate analysis for the various end points, PRL-3 came out as an independent and significant indicator of poor survival for BFFS (HR = 1.53, CI95% 1.10-2.13, p = 0.012), CFFS (HR = 2.41, CI95% 1.17-4.98, p = 0.017) and PCDFS (HR = 3.99, CI95% 1.21-13.1, p = 0.023).

Methods and material:   Between August 2010 and April 2013, 76 patients with intermediated-risk prostate carcinoma were included in the study. A first course delivered 46 Gy by IMRT (68.4% of patients) or 3D conformal radiotherapy (31.6% of patients). The second course delivered a boost of 18 Gy (3x6Gy) within 10 days. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were evaluated as defined by NCI-CTCAE (v4.0). Secondary outcome measures were local control, overall and metastasis-free survival, PSA kinetics, and patient functional status (urinary and sexual) according to the IIEF5 and IPSS questionnaires.  Results:   The overall treatment time was 45 days (median, range 40-55). Median follow-up was 26.4 months (range, 13.6-29.9 months). Seventy-seven per cent (n = 58) of patients presented a Gleason score of 7. At 24 months, biological-free survival was 98.7% (95% CI, 92.8-99.9%) and median PSA 0.46 ng/mL (range, 0.06-6.20 ng/mL). Grade ≥2 acute GI and GU toxicities were 13.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Grade ≥2 late GI and GU toxicities were observed in 6.6% and 2.6% of patients, respectively. No grade 4 toxicity was observed.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated stereotactic boost is effective and safely delivered for intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma after conventional radiation. Mild-term relapse-free survival and tolerance results are promising, and further follow-up is warranted to confirm the results at long term.

In myxoid and round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS), an adipocytic tumor characterized by the expression of the fusion oncogene FUS-CHOP, SRC have been found as one of the most activated kinases. Here we used a cell-of-origin model of MRCLS and an MRCLS cell line to thoroughly characterize the mechanisms of cell invasion induced by FUS-CHOP using in vitro (3D spheroid invasion assays) and in vivo (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model) approaches. FUS-CHOP expression activated SRC-FAK signaling and increased the invasive ability of MRCLS cells. In addition, FAK expression was found to significantly correlate with tumor aggressiveness in sarcoma patient samples. The involvement of SRC/FAK activation in FUS-CHOP-mediated invasion was further confirmed using the SRC inhibitor dasatinib, the specific FAK inhibitor PF-573228, and FAK siRNA. Notably, dasatinib and PF573228 could also efficiently block the invasion of cancer stem cell subpopulations. Downstream of SRC/FAK signaling, we found that FUS-CHOP expression increases the levels of the RHO/ROCK downstream effector phospho-MLC2 (T18/S19) and that this activation was prevented by dasatinib or PF573228. Moreover, the ROCK inhibitor RKI-1447 was able to completely abolish invasion in FUS-CHOP-expressing cells. These data uncover the involvement of SRC/FAK/RHO/ROCK signaling axis in FUS-CHOP-mediated invasion, thus providing a rationale for testing inhibitors of this pathway as potential novel antimetastatic agents for MRCLS treatment.""","""['Juan Tornin', 'Francisco Hermida-Prado', 'Ranjit Singh Padda', 'M Victoria Gonzalez', 'Carlos Alvarez-Fernandez', 'Veronica Rey', 'Lucia Martinez-Cruzado', 'Oscar Estupiñan', 'Sofia T Menendez', 'Lucia Fernandez-Nevado', 'Aurora Astudillo', 'Juan P Rodrigo', 'Fabrice Lucien', 'Yohan Kim', 'Hon S Leong', 'Juana Maria Garcia-Pedrero', 'Rene Rodriguez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Detection of FUS-CHOP fusion gene in paraffin-embedded tissues and its clinicopathologic significance for myxoid/round cell liposarcomas.', 'Role of FUS-CHOP in Myxoid Liposarcoma via miR-486/CDK4 Axis.', 'Expression of the FUS-CHOP fusion protein in primary mesenchymal progenitor cells gives rise to a model of myxoid liposarcoma.', 'Current idea of the morphogenetic features of liposarcomas.', 'Updates on the cytogenetics and molecular genetics of bone and soft tissue tumors: liposarcoma.', 'Cold plasma and inhibition of STAT3 selectively target tumorigenicity in osteosarcoma.', 'Functional and clinical characteristics of focal adhesion kinases in cancer progression.', 'Addressing Doxorubicin Resistance in Bone Sarcomas Using Novel Drug-Resistant Models.', 'FAK in Cancer: From Mechanisms to Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Mithramycin delivery systems to develop effective therapies in sarcomas.']"""

Ra is an α-emitting radionuclide that has been approved for use in the treatment of bone metastases that are secondary to castration resistant prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Six patients received two weight-based administrations of Ra 6 weeks apart. Activity excreted in the urine and faeces during the first 48 h following each treatment was assessed by direct counting of the excreta. During the same period the whole-body retention of Ra was also determined using a single probe counting system. The results of the excreta counting and the whole-body counting were compared to determine whether whole-body counting was a suitable surrogate for assessing excretion. Further whole-body retention counts were made at around 3, 4, 7 and 42 days following treatment.  Results:   Patterns of excretion and retention of Ra varied significantly between patients, but were similar for each patient's pair of treatments. The cumulative maximum activity excreted in the initial 8-h period following the Ra administration was 2.6% that increased to 39% at 48 h.

Objective:   A new series of 3,5-disubstituted-2-thioxoimidazolidinone derivatives 10a-f and their S-methyl analogs 11a-f were designed, synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3), human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and non-cancerous human lung fibroblast cell line (WI-38). Results and Method: While compounds 10a-f showed a broad range of activities against PC-3 and MCF-7 cell lines (IC50 = 34.0 - 186.9 and 24.6 - 147.5 µM respectively), the S-methyl analogs 11a-f showed (IC50 = 22.7 - 198.5 and 16.9 - 188.2 µM respectively) in comparison with 5-fluorouracil (IC50 = 60.7 and 40.7 µM respectively). 11c (IC50 = 22.7 and 29.2 µM) and 11f (IC50 = 28.7 and 16.9 µM) were the most potent among all compounds against both PC-3 and MCF-7 respectively with no cytotoxicity against WI-38.

Methods:   Men with maximum Likert-score 3/5 within their PZ were retrospectively selected from 330 patients who prospectively underwent prostate mpMRI (3 T) without an endorectal coil, followed by 20-zone transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies ＋/- focal lesion-targeted biopsy. PSAD was calculated using pre-biopsy PSA and MRI-derived volume. Two readers A and B independently assessed included men with both Likert-assessment and PI-RADS_v2. Both readers then classified mpMRI morphological features in consensus. Men were divided into two groups: significant cancer (≥ Gleason 3 ＋ 4) or insignificant cancer (≤ Gleason 3 ＋ 3)/no cancer.

Due to the location of anterior tumours, they are often diagnosed with a large size and may be suspicious for extra-prostatic extension (EPE). We aim to evaluate whether PI-RADS v2 is more accurate in assessing anterior prostate lesions identified on mpMRI compared to PI-RADS v1.  Methods:   Patients with anterior prostate lesions diagnosed on mpMRI who proceeded to a cognitive fusion transperineal prostate biopsy were identified. Each mpMRI was blinded and read by two experienced prostate MRI radiologists and assigned a PI-RADS v1 and PI-RADS v2 score, and the presence of EPE was estimated. Correlation was made with transperineal histopathology and, where relevant, radical prostatectomy histopathology. Concordance measures between PI-RADS v1 and PI-RADS v2, and between examiners of the same PI-RADS score were calculated using a weighted kappa.  Results:   Fifty-eight consecutive men were identified. Concordance between the examiners for PI-RADS v1 and for v2 showed substantial agreement (version 1: weighted kappa 0.71; version 2: weighted kappa 0.69). There was no difference in accuracy when using PI-RADS v1 or PI-RADS v2 to predict clinically significant cancer. There was poor correlation between EPE measured on mpMRI compared with EPE in radical prostatectomy histopathology.

Different therapeutic approaches, therefore, aim to restore the death mechanisms for enhanced apoptosis.

Since Pseudomonas Exotoxin A-based immunotoxins are known to preferentially inhibit the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, the rationale was to test our immunotoxin in combination with the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, which specifically inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w for enhanced induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The immunotoxin showed high and specific binding and cytotoxicity against PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells marked by a direct inhibition of Mcl-1. The combination of the immunotoxin with a subtoxic concentration of ABT-737 caused additive or even synergistic effects, which were based on an enhanced apoptosis induction as detected by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Caspase-3 cleavage in Western blot.

However, the discrepancy in the underlying molecular event between these types of cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated to date and warrants comprehensive investigation. To this end, an integrated dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to compare and contrast LCC and RCC, covering mutation, DNA methylation, gene expression, and miRNA. Briefly, the signaling pathway cross-talk is more prevalent in RCC than LCC, such as RCC-specific PI3K pathway, which often exhibits cross-talk with the RAS and P53 pathways. Meanwhile, methylation signatures revealed that RCC was hypermethylated relative to LCC. In addition, differentially expressed genes (n = 253) and differentially expressed miRNAs (n = 16) were determined between LCC and RCC. Especially for Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 1 (PRAC1), a gene that was closely associated with hypermethylation, was the top significantly downregulated gene in RCC. Multi-omics comparison of LCC and RCC suggests that there are more aggressive markers in RCC and that tumor heterogeneity occurs within the location-based subtypes of colon cancer. These results clarify the debate regarding the conflicting prognosis between LCC and RCC, as proposed by different studies.Implications: The underlying molecular features present in LCC and RCC identified in this study are beneficial for adopting reasonable therapeutic approaches to prolong overall survival and progression-free survival in colorectal cancer patients.

However, its contributions to tumorigenesis are uncertain and have been disputed. Here, we provide evidence of tumor suppressive activity of PPARD in prostate cancer through a noncanonical and ligand-independent pathway. PPARD was downregulated in prostate cancer specimens. In murine prostate epithelium, PPARD gene deletion resulted in increased cellularity. Genetic modulation of PPARD in human prostate cancer cell lines validated the tumor suppressive activity of this gene in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, PPARD exerted its activity in a DNA binding-dependent and ligand-independent manner. We identified a novel set of genes repressed by PPARD that failed to respond to ligand-mediated activation. Among these genes, we observed robust regulation of the secretory trefoil factor family (TFF) members, including a causal and correlative association of TFF1 with prostate cancer biology in vitro and in patient specimens. Overall, our results illuminate the oncosuppressive function of PPARD and understanding of the pathogenic molecular pathways elicited by this nuclear receptor.Significance: These findings challenge the presumption that the function of the nuclear receptor PPARβ/δ in cancer is dictated by ligand-mediated activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of SAHA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, were studied before and after treatment with SAHA. The effects of SAHA treatment on cell proliferation were studied using the MTT cell proliferation assay. Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining were used to study the effects of SAHA treatment on cell apoptosis. Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and short interfering (si)RNA assays were performed to study the effects of SAHA treatment on apoptotic and cell cycle proteins and the Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway. RESULTS Treatment with SAHA inhibited cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent way. Cell cycle analysis and Annexin-V FITC/PI staining showed that treatment with SAHA resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. Also, treatment with SAHA reduced the protein expression levels cyclin B and cyclin A2 and promoted the activation of FOXO3a by inhibiting Akt activation. Western blotting, the siRNA assay, and qPCR showed that FOXO3a, the Bcl-2 family of proteins, survivin, and FasL were involved in SAHA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells grown in vitro.

Continence status (number of pads that was used), complications (erosion or extrusion, urethral atrophy, and infection), malfunctions, and need for secondary implantation were evaluated. The relationship between complications and prior or subsequent radiation therapy (RT) was also examined.  Results:   From May 2001 to January 2016, 121 consecutive patients underwent AS implantation for PPI at an oncological referral center in Brazil. At the last visit, the AS remained implanted in 106 patients (87.6%), who reported adequate continence status (maximum of 1 pad/day). Eight-two subjects (67.8%) claimed not to be using pads on a regular basis at the final visit (completely dry). Revision occurred in 24 patients (19.8%).Radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy was used in 47 patients before or after AS placement. Twelve patients with a history of RT had urethral erosion compared with 3 men without RT (p=0.004).

Herein, we describe oncologic outcomes and predictors of disease response after salvage whole gland HIFU from our prospective cohort.  Materials and methods:   Patients with localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled from January 2005 to December 2014. Participants had to meet both biochemical and histological definitions of recurrence. Exclusion criteria included the receipt of prior salvage therapy, presence of metastatic disease, and administration of ADT in the 6-months prior to enrollment. Participants were treated with a single session of whole-gland HIFU ablation with the AblathermTM device (EDAP, France). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as a composite endpoint of PSA progression (Phoenix criteria), receipt of any further salvage therapy, receipt of ADT, clinical progression, or death. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the primary end-point and stratifications were used to determine the significance of 6 pre-specified predictors of improved RFS (TRUS biopsy grade, number of study entry TRUS biopsy cores positive, palpable disease at study enrollment, pre-HIFU PSA, an undetectable post-HIFU PSA nadir, and receipt of prior hormone therapy). Survival analysis was performed on participants with a minimum of 1-year follow-up.  Results:   Twenty-four participants were eligible for study inclusion with a median follow-up of 31.0 months. Median PSA at study entry was 4.02ng/ml. Median time to PSA nadir was 3 months after treatment and median post-HIFU PSA nadir was 0.04ng/ ml. Median 2-year and 5-year RFS was 66.3% and 51.6% respectively. Of our 6 pre-specified predictors, an undetectable PSA nadir was the only significant predictor of improved RFS (HR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.29, log-rank P<0.001). One participant underwent an intervention for a urethral stricture. No participants developed osteitis pubis or rectourethral fistulae.  Conclusions:   Salvage HIFU allows for disease control in selected patients with localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer.

In this study, we aimed to compare the oxidative stress (OS) parameters in patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer (pCa), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (AIP), according to the histopathologic examination of transrectal ultrasonographic prostate biopsy and transurethral prostate resection specimens.  Objectives:   In this study, we aimed to compare oxidative stress between histologically proven prostate cancer, hyperplasia and prostatitis.  Material and methods:   According to histopathologic examinations, 97 patients were divided into 3 study groups: group 1: pCa (n = 30), group 2: BPH (n = 41), and group 3: AIP (n = 26). Finally, 30 patients were enrolled in a control group. MDA levels, CuZn-SOD, Se-GPx, CAT activities, and trace element levels were evaluated.  Results:   A statistically significant difference between prostate cancer and other groups were documented in terms of MDA activity. Contrary to AIP, a statistically significant difference has also been encountered between BPH and the control group. Decreased CuZn-SOD enzyme levels were found in PCa and BPH patients without statistical significance. Increased CAT activity was also documented in PCa, BPH and AIP patients. No significant difference in GPX activity was documented between the groups, except BPH and control group. Trace element levels were low in the patients with prostate cancer and BPH when compared with the control group.  Conclusions:   Despite the data regarding OS in PCa patients, there is a paucity of data regarding BPH and especially AIP patients. Our study revealed obvious oxidative stress in BPH and PCa patients as opposed to AIP. Assessing the oxidative stress in these patients may assist in the future prevention, diagnosis and also treatment.

The US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial indicated no such reduction but had a wide 95% CI (rate ratio for prostate cancer mortality, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87-1.36). Standard meta-analyses are unable to account for key differences between the trials that can impact the estimated effects of screening and the trials' point estimates.  Methods:   The authors calibrated 2 microsimulation models to individual-level incidence and mortality data from 238,936 men participating in the ERSPC and PLCO trials. A cure parameter for the underlying efficacy of screening was estimated by the models separately for each trial. The authors changed step-by-step major known differences in trial settings, including enrollment and attendance patterns, screening intervals, PSA thresholds, biopsy receipt, control arm contamination, and primary treatment, to reflect a more ideal protocol situation and differences between the trials.  Results:   Using the cure parameter estimated for the ERSPC, the models projected 19% to 21% and 6% to 8%, respectively, prostate cancer mortality reductions in the ERSPC and PLCO settings. Using this cure parameter, the models projected a reduction of 37% to 43% under annual screening with 100% attendance and biopsy compliance and no contamination. The cure parameter estimated for the PLCO trial was 0.  Conclusions:   The observed cancer mortality reduction in screening trials appears to be highly sensitive to trial protocol and practice settings.

Methods:   A single-center parallel-group randomized controlled trial of men with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT was performed. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to 1) a patient bone health pamphlet and brief recommendations for their family physician (BHP+FP); 2) a BHP and support from a bone health care coordinator (BHP+BHCC); or 3) usual care. The primary efficacy outcome was receipt of a bone mineral density (BMD) test within 6 months. Secondary efficacy outcomes included guideline-appropriate calcium and vitamin D use and bisphosphonate prescriptions for men at high fracture risk. Feasibility endpoints included recruitment, retention, satisfaction, contamination, and outcome capture. The main analysis used logistic regression with a 1-sided P of .10. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT02043236).  Results:   A total of 119 men were recruited.

Radiation therapy (RT) is widely considered the standard treatment for PCa. IL-37 is an IL-1 family member, and it has been extensively studied in immunity. However, no studies have been done regarding its potential as a radiosensitizer. This study is designed to investigate the direct effect of IL-37 on growth of DU145 and PC-3, two widely studied PCa cell lines, and to investigate whether IL-37 could be used as a radiosensitizer for PCa. Clonogenic survival and quick cell proliferation assays along with immunohistochemistry, TUNEL staining, and caspace-3 activity assay kits as well as RT-PCR were used in this study. Our results showed that IL-37 has little direct effect on growth of PCa. However, IL-37/RT enhanced RT-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis in both cell lines. We further found that IL-37/RT upregulated the mRNA expression of p27, Fas, and Bax, while downregulating the mRNA expression of cdk2 in DU145 cells. These findings suggest that IL-37 has the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer for PCa and warrants further investigation.""","""['Vivi A Ding', 'Ziwen Zhu', 'Timothy A Steele', 'Mark R Wakefield', 'Huaping Xiao', 'Dean Balabanov', 'Yujiang Fang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['A Potential Role for Green Tea as a Radiation Sensitizer for Prostate Cancer.', 'Resveratrol enhances radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell senescence and apoptosis.', 'Dichloroacetate (DCA) sensitizes both wild-type and over expressing Bcl-2 prostate cancer cells in vitro to radiation.', 'IL-39 Reduces Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis of Bladder Cancer by Altering the Activity of Cyclin E and Fas.', 'Galiellalactone is a novel therapeutic candidate against hormone-refractory prostate cancer expressing activated Stat3.', 'SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibits growth of prostate cancer: a potential role of the COVID-19 vaccine killing two birds with one stone.', 'IL-37-induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes IL-1R8/Sigirr phosphorylation, internalization, and degradation in lung epithelial cells.', 'IL-37: An anti-inflammatory cytokine with antitumor functions.', 'IL-37 promotes cell apoptosis in cervical cancer involving Bim upregulation.', 'IL-39 acts as a friend to pancreatic cancer.']"""

Compared to printed booklets, web-based information technology offers more possibilities to tailor information to patients' individual needs.  Objectives:   To support the decision-making process as well as the communication with patients, we developed an online tutorial in a systematic process in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and then tested it in a pilot study. The study investigated users' satisfaction, the coverage of information needs, the preparation for decision making, and the subjective quality of the decision.  Materials and methods:   Based on already existing information material, the online tutorial was developed in an iterative process using focus groups with patients and urologists. For the following evaluation in eight clinics a total of 87 patients were invited to access the platform and participate in the study. Of these patients, 56 used the tutorial and 48 answered both surveys (the first one 4 weeks after the first login and the second one 3 months after treatment decision). The surveys used the Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PDMS), the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS).  Results and conclusion:   Satisfaction with the tutorial is very high among patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. Users find their information needs sufficiently covered. Three months after the decision they felt that they were well prepared for the decision making (mean PDMS 75, standard deviation [SD] 23), they had low decisional conflict (mean DCS 9.6, SD 11), and almost no decisional regret (mean DRS 6.4, SD 9.6).

In this study, DC-based vaccines, both pulsed and unpulsed, were as effective as docetaxel (DTX) in reducing prostate tumors in the orthotopic transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. However, we did not observe any additive or synergic effects of chemoimmunotherapy on the tumor growth, while only the combination of DTX and pulsed dendritic cells resulted in significantly lower proliferation detected by Ki67 staining in histological samples. The DC-based vaccine pulsed with HHP-treated tumor cells was also combined with another type of cytostatic, cyclophosphamide, with similar results. In another clinically relevant setting, minimal residual tumor disease after surgery, administration of DC-based vaccines after the surgery of poorly immunogenic transplanted TRAMP-C2, as well as in immunogenic TC-1 tumors, reduced the growth of tumor recurrences. To identify the effector cell populations after DC vaccine application, mice were twice immunized with both pulsed and unpulsed DC vaccine, and the cytotoxicity of the spleen cells populations was tested.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of rSBRT in patients experiencing locally recurrent prostate cancer after prior definitive or postoperative radiotherapy using the Cyberknife.  Materials and methods:   Data from 50 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Local recurrence was assessed by 18F-choline positron emission tomography and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; a dose of 30 Gy was delivered in five fractions. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was assessed at 2 months, 6 months and every 4 months thereafter. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE v.4.03.  Results:   All patients received prior EBRT. The median EQD2 total dose was 74 Gy (60-80 Gy). Eleven patients were receiving androgen deprivation after prior biochemical failure. At 6 months, 41 patients showed a median PSA decline of -77.1% (14.3-99.3%), whereas nine patients experienced a median PSA elevation of +58.7% (0-2300.0%). Biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) was 80.0%. Impaired BRFS was correlated with the high-risk category at diagnosis (P = 0.014, hazard ratio 5.61) and ongoing androgen deprivation (P = 0.025, hazard ratio 2.98). Neither clinical variables nor dosimetric parameters were found to be predictive for toxicity.  Conclusion:   Focal rSBRT can achieve durable remission in locally relapsing patients and systemic treatment can be postponed with acceptable toxicity.

Additionally, we have investigated c-KIT protein expression by immunoblotting in two primary canine prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   Eleven normal prostates, 12 proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) prostates, 18 PC, 3 metastatic lesions and two prostate cancer cell cultures (PC1 and PC2) were analysed. The prostatic tissue exhibited varying degrees of membranous, cytoplasmic or membranous/cytoplasmic c-KIT staining. Four normal prostates, 4 PIA and 5 prostatic carcinomas showed positive c-KIT expression. No c-KIT immunoexpression was observed in metastases. Canine prostate cancer and PIA samples contained a higher number of Ki67-positive cells compared to normal samples. The median relative quantification (RQ) for c-KIT expression in normal, PIA and prostate cancer and metastatic samples were 0.6 (0.1-2.5), 0.7 (0.09-2.1), 0.7 (0.09-5.1) and 0.1 (0.07-0.6), respectively. A positive correlation between the number of Ki67-positive cells and c-KIT transcript levels was observed in prostate cancer samples. In the cell line, PC1 was negative for c-KIT protein expression, while PC2 was weakly positive.  Conclusion:   The present study identified a strong correlation between c-KIT expression and proliferative index, suggesting that c-KIT may influence cell proliferation.

The present study induced overexpression and knockdown of PHB2 in PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) with the aim of examining the effects of PHB2 on PCa cell migration via wound healing assays. The results indicated that PHB2 overexpression promoted migration of both cell lines. AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2), which interacts with PHB2, has been reported to participate in cell migration; therefore, the present study examined the effects PHB2 overexpression and knockdown on AKT2 in PCa cells.

In addition, knockdown of PHB2 enhanced the protein stability of AKT2. Furthermore, AKT2 overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in migration, whereas AKT2 knockdown promoted migration of PC3 and DU145 PCa cells. The combined overexpression of PHB2 and AKT2 inhibited migration of both cell lines, thus suggesting that AKT2 overexpression abolished PHB2-induced migration.

In this study, we therefore examined the cytotoxic effects and anticancer mechanism(s) of action of second generation curcumin analogs towards CRPC cells. For this purpose, PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with a series of curcumin analogs at 0-10 µM for 72 h and cytotoxicity was determined by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Two compounds, 1-isopropyl-3,5-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethylene)-4-piperidone (RL118) and 1-methyl-3,5-[(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)methylene]-4-piperidone (RL121), were found to have the most potent cytotoxic effect with EC50 values of 0.50 and 0.58 µM in the PC3 cells and EC50 values of 0.76 and 0.69 µM in the DU145 cells, respectively. Thus, further experiments were performed focusing on these two compounds. Flow cytometry was performed to determine their effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Both analogs increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis. Specifically, in the PC3 cells, RL121 increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase by 86% compared to the control, while RL118 increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase by 42% compared to the control after 24 h. Moreover, both RL118 and RL121 induced the apoptosis of both cell lines. In the DU145 cells, a 38-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells was elicited by RL118 and a 78-fold increase by RL121 compared to the control. Furthermore, the effects of both analogs on the expression of key proteins involved in cell proliferation were also determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that both analogs inhibited the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65/RelA), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), p-4E-BP1, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, AKT and p-AKT.

Furthermore, database analysis suggested that COUP‑TFII expression in patients with gastric cancer is correlated with clinical stage classification and increased expression levels of COUP‑TFII improved overall survival rates in patients with gastric cancer. The results of the present study suggest that COUP‑TFII functions as a significant regulatory suppressor of gastric cancer growth and metastasis, and suggests that COUP‑TFII may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer metastasis.""","""['Weiji Ding', 'Yunda Zhang', 'Huali Cai', 'Gang Liu', 'Yongzhi Ye', 'Guoxing Xu', 'Haibin Wang', 'Disheng Xiong', 'Chuankai Zhang', 'Zhengjie Huang', 'Qi Luo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['MicroRNA-382 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through targeting COUP-TFII.', 'Upregulated expression of long noncoding RNA SNHG15 promotes cell proliferation and invasion through regulates MMP2/MMP9 in patients with GC.', 'Hypoxia-inducible microRNA-224 promotes the cell growth, migration and invasion by directly targeting RASSF8 in gastric cancer.', 'COUP‑TFII promotes epithelial‑mesenchymal transition by inhibiting miR‑34a expression in colorectal cancer.', 'Significances of contactin-1 expression in human gastric cancer and knockdown of contactin-1 expression inhibits invasion and metastasis of MKN45 gastric cancer cells.', 'NR2F2 controls malignant squamous cell carcinoma state by promoting stemness and invasion and repressing differentiation.', 'Single-cell RNA-seq reveals transcriptional landscape and intratumor heterogenicity in gallbladder cancer liver metastasis microenvironment.', 'Recent progress on the role and molecular mechanism of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II in cancer.', 'COUP-TFII in Health and Disease.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII is an oncogenic gene in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

However, the role of SPARC in prostate cancer (PCa) is still controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the abnormalities in the expression of SPARC and its promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancers and in correlated clinicopathological profiles. We examined the hypermethylation of the SPARC promoter as a potential mechanism for suppressing SPARC in PCa. The clinicopathological correlation between SPARC and its promoter expression and the prognostic significance of the aberrantly expressed genes were evaluated to identify novel biomarkers of PCa. SPARC expression was decreased in PCa cell lines, which correlated with hypermethylation of the SPARC promoter. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-Cdr restored SPARC expression. Seventy percent (145 of 207) of the primary tumors exhibited SPARC hypermethylation, while only 2.6% was found in normal prostate mucosa (n=38). In PCa cases, SPARC hypermethylation was correlated with a poorer prognosis (P=0.005; relative risk 2.659, 95% CI, 1.433‑4.562). Our findings revealed potential diagnostic markers of PCa based on specific hypermethylated CpG sites and also provided new insights of SPARC as a novel biomarker and/or treatment modality for prostate cancer.""","""['Tieshi Liu', 'Xuefeng Qiu', 'Xiaozhi Zhao', 'Rong Yang', 'Huibo Lian', 'Feng Qu', 'Xiaogong Li', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Frequent inactivation of SPARC by promoter hypermethylation in colon cancers.', 'Aberrant promoter methylation of SPARC in ovarian cancer.', 'Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'Prognostic Significance of SPARC Expression in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'SPARC in Tumor Pathophysiology and as a Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'The Matricellular Protein SPARC Decreases in the Lacrimal Gland At Adulthood and During Inflammation.', 'Design and experimental validation of OPERA_MET-A panel for deep methylation analysis by next generation sequencing.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'SOX8 Affects Tumoral SPARC Expression by Regulating EZH2 to Attenuate Effectiveness of albumin-bound paclitaxel in PDAC.']"""

The expression data of miR‑223‑3p in HCC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Data for the precursor miR‑223 were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The diagnostic role of miR‑223‑3p was identified by the receiver operating curve (ROC), and the diagnostic value of miR‑223‑3p in HCC was calculated from qualified reports in the literature. In addition, associated data from the GEO, TCGA and qualified experiments were pooled for comprehensive meta‑analysis. Genes, which intersected between online prediction databases, natural language processing and differentially expressed genes from TCGA were regarded as potential targets of miR‑223‑3p in HCC. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of potential targets were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The protein‑protein interactions were mapped using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes. Among 15 qualified microarray data sets from GEO, seven showed that a significantly lower level of miR‑223‑3p was present in the HCC tissues, compared with that in non‑cancerous tissues (P<0.05). In addition, five GEO data sets revealed diagnostic values of miR‑223‑3p, with an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.80 (P<0.05). The diagnostic accuracy of the precursor miR‑223 in TCGA was also calculated (AUC=0.78, P<0.05). Similarly, the precursor miR‑223 showed a higher level of downregulation in HCC tissues, compared with that in healthy controls in TCGA (P<0.001). A summary ROC was also calculated as 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85‑0.91) in the meta‑analysis. A total of 72 potential targets were extracted, mainly involved in the terms 'microRNAs in cancer', 'ATP binding' and 'prostate cancer'. Five potential target genes were considered the hub genes of miR‑223‑3p in HCC, including checkpoint kinase 1, DNA methyltransferase 1, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5, kinesin family member 23, and collagen, type I, α1.

However, it is not known whether PRL‑3 plays a similar role in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, immunoblot analysis of androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa lines (LNCaP and LNCaP‑SF) revealed the constitutive cytoplasmic expression of PRL‑3, and stimulation with R1881 (AR agonist) rapidly increased the nuclear translocation of PRL‑3. The AR-negative cell lines exhibited negligible PRL‑3 expression, and the ectopic overexpression of PRL‑3 increased both the proliferative and invasive potential of PC3 and DU145 cells. In addition, we measured PRL‑3 protein expression in human prostate tumor sections. A high-density prostate tumor microarray (TMA) was immunostained to assess whether PRL‑3 expression and its subcellular localization (cytoplasmic and nuclear levels) is associated with the Gleason score (GS), Gleason grade (GG) and tumor stage (T-stage). Digital image analysis (DIA) revealed that PRL‑3 expression was significantly higher in the malignant cores, as compared to the non‑malignant areas. Increases in both total and nuclear PRL‑3 levels were also associated with a higher GS and GG. Metastatic tumors (T4‑stage) had lower cytoplasmic, but higher nuclear PRL‑3 levels. Furthermore, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for PRL‑3 in the tumors graded as GS7 could effectively distinguish between indolent (3+4) and aggressive (4+3) disease. Thus, our experiments using PCa lines suggested that PRL‑3 is an AR-regulated gene and its androgen-induced nuclear localization may increase the aggressive behavior of PCa cells. Furthermore, the digital analysis of immunostained tumor sections suggested that PRL‑3 may be an effective biomarker of high-grade PCa, and its nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio may be used to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive tumors.""","""['Donna R Edwards', 'Krzysztof Moroz', 'Haitao Zhang', 'David Mulholland', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed', 'Debasis Mondal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['PRL3 as a therapeutic target for novel cancer immunotherapy in multiple cancer types.', 'PBOV1 as a potential biomarker for more advanced prostate cancer based on protein and digital histomorphometric analysis.', 'Use of two gene panels for prostate cancer diagnosis and patient risk stratification.', 'Prostate cancer: prognostic significance of the association of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and androgen receptor expression.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A systematic method introduced a common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the different stages of prostate cancer.', 'PRL3 as a therapeutic target for novel cancer immunotherapy in multiple cancer types.', 'LINC01207 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging miR-1182 to upregulate AKT3.', 'MiR-23a induced the activation of CDC42/PAK1 pathway and cell cycle arrest in human cov434 cells by targeting FGD4.', 'A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.']"""

While routine metastatic tissue biopsy is challenging in mCRPC, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive tool to sample the tumor genome. However, no systematic comparisons of matched ""liquid"" and ""solid"" biopsies have been performed that would enable ctDNA profiling to replace the need for direct tissue sampling.  Methods:   We performed targeted sequencing across 72 clinically relevant genes in 45 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected at time of metastatic tissue biopsy. We compared ctDNA alterations with exome sequencing data generated from matched tissue and quantified the concordance of mutations and copy number alterations using the Fisher exact test and Pearson correlations.  Results:   Seventy-five point six percent of cfDNA samples had a ctDNA proportion greater than 2% of total cfDNA. In these patients, all somatic mutations identified in matched metastatic tissue biopsies were concurrently present in ctDNA. Furthermore, the hierarchy of variant allele fractions for shared mutations was remarkably similar between ctDNA and tissue. Copy number profiles between matched liquid and solid biopsy were highly correlated, and individual copy number calls in clinically actionable genes were 88.9% concordant. Detected alterations included AR amplifications in 22 (64.7%) samples, SPOP mutations in three (8.8%) samples, and inactivating alterations in tumor suppressors TP53 , PTEN , RB1 , APC , CDKN1B , BRCA2 , and PIK3R1 . In several patients, ctDNA sequencing revealed robust changes not present in paired solid biopsy, including clinically relevant alterations in the AR, WNT, and PI3K pathways.

In addition to antiplatelet activity, antiplatelet agents possess anticancer and antimetastatic properties. Contrary to this, results of some studies have suggested that the use of clopidogrel and other thienopyridines accelerates the progression of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel and various anticancer agents as a combined treatment using mouse models of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Metastatic dissemination, selected parameters of platelet morphology and biochemistry, as well as angiogenesis were assessed. In addition, body weight, blood morphology, and biochemistry were evaluated to test toxicity of the studied compounds. According to the results, clopidogrel increased antitumor and/or antimetastatic activity of chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone, whereas it decreased the anticancer activity of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and tamoxifen. The mechanisms of such divergent activities may be based on the modulation of tumor vasculature via factors, such as transforming growth factor β1 released from platelets. Moreover, clopidogrel increased the toxicity of docetaxel and protected against mitoxantrone-induced toxicity, which may be due to the modulation of hepatic enzymes and protection of the vasculature, respectively. These results demonstrate that antiplatelet agents can be useful but also dangerous in anticancer treatment and therefore use of thienopyridines in patients undergoing chemotherapy should be carefully evaluated.""","""['Agnieszka Denslow', 'Marta Świtalska', 'Joanna Jarosz', 'Diana Papiernik', 'Kseniia Porshneva', 'Marcin Nowak', 'Joanna Wietrzyk']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Combination Therapy with DETA/NO and Clopidogrel Inhibits Metastasis in Murine Mammary Gland Cancer Models via Improved Vasoprotection.', 'Clopidogrel use and cancer-specific mortality: a population-based cohort study of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer patients.', 'The effect of clopidogrel on platelet activity in patients with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus: a comparative study.', 'Clopidogrel: the future choice for preventing platelet activation during coronary stenting?', 'Thienopyridines in cardiovascular disease: focus on clopidogrel resistance.', 'Interactions between Platelets and Tumor Microenvironment Components in Ovarian Cancer and Their Implications for Treatment and Clinical Outcomes.', 'Targeting Platelet Activation Pathways to Limit Tumour Progression: Current State of Affairs.', 'Doxorubicin-Induced Platelet Activation and Clearance Relieved by Salvianolic Acid Compound: Novel Mechanism and Potential Therapy for Chemotherapy-Associated Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia.', 'Repurposing the Antiplatelet Agent Ticlopidine to Counteract the Acute Phase of ER Stress Condition: An Opportunity for Fighting Coronavirus Infections and Cancer.', 'Pleiotropic effects of clopidogrel.']"""

It is well-known that androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in a vast majority of prostate tumors. However, recent evidence emerged stating that estrogen receptors (ERs) may also contribute to prostate tumor development. Moreover, progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer may be associated with differential expression genes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore we aimed to assess the significance of receptors status as well as EMT marker genes expression among PRAD patients in accordance to their age and Gleason score.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed TCGA gene expression profiles of 497 prostate tumor samples according to 43 genes involved in EMT and 3 hormone receptor genes (AR, ESR1, ESR2) as well as clinical characteristic of cancer patients. Then patients were divided into four groups according to their age and 5 groups according to Gleason score. Next, we evaluated PRAD samples according to relationship between the set of variables in different combinations and compared differential expression in subsequent groups of patients. The analysis was applied using R packages: FactoMineR, gplots, RColorBrewer and NMF.  Results:   MFA analysis resulted in distinct grouping of PRAD patients into four age categories according to expression level of AR, ESR1 and ESR2 with the most distinct group of age less than 50 years old. Further investigations indicated opposite expression profiles of EMT markers between different age groups as well as strong association of EMT gene expression with Gleason score. We found that depending on age of prostate cancer patients and Gleason score EMT genes with distinctly altered expression are: KRT18, KRT19, MUC1 and COL4A1, CTNNB1, SNAI2, ZEB1 and MMP3.  Conclusions:   Our major observation is that prostate cancer from patients under 50 years old compared to older ones has entirely different EMT gene expression profiles showing potentially more aggressive invasive phenotype, despite Gleason score classification.""","""['Dorota Jędroszka', 'Magdalena Orzechowska', 'Raneem Hamouz', 'Karolina Górniak', 'Andrzej K Bednarek']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion.', 'Comprehensive study of gene and microRNA expression related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition mediates docetaxel resistance and high risk of relapse in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer: an overview.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prognostic significance of microRNAs related to metastatic and EMT process among prostate cancer patients.', 'Anti-complement 5 antibody ameliorates antibody-mediated rejection after liver transplantation in rats.', 'Hierarchical contribution of individual lifestyle factors and their interactions on adenomatous and serrated polyp risk.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Markers in Prostate Cancer: From Bench to Bedside.', 'The Transcriptomic Profiles of ESR1 and MMP3 Stratify the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Primary Prostate Cancer beyond Clinical Features.', 'Identification of key biomarkers of the glomerulus in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and their relationship with immune cell infiltration based on WGCNA and the LASSO algorithm.']"""

We also found that, contrary to the current notions about CK2, some CK2 transcripts were downregulated in several cancers. Here, we investigate all other cancers using Oncomine to determine whether they also display significant CK2 transcript dysregulation. As anticipated from our previous analysis, we found cancers with all CK2 transcripts upregulated (e.g. cervical), and cancers where there was a combination of upregulation and/or downregulation of the CK2 transcripts (e.g. sarcoma). Unexpectedly, we found some cancers with significant downregulation of all CK2 transcripts (e.g. testicular cancer). We also found that, in some cases, CK2 transcript levels were already dysregulated in benign lesions (e.g. Barrett's esophagus). We also found that CK2 transcript upregulation correlated with lower patient survival in most cases where data was significant. However, there were two cancer types, glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma, where CK2 transcript upregulation correlated with higher survival.

Here, cellular bioeffects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are compared to those of CB nanoparticles. In DU145 prostate-cancer cells, photoporation using CB nanoparticles transitions from (i) cells with molecular uptake to (ii) nonviable cells to (iii) fragmented cells with increasing laser fluence, as seen previously. In contrast, photoporation with MWCNTs causes uptake and, at higher fluence, fragmentation, but does not generate nonviable cells, and SWCNTs show little evidence of bioeffects, except at extreme laser conditions, which generate nonviable cells and fragmentation, but no significant uptake. These different behaviors cannot be explained by photoacoustic pressure output from the particles. All particle types emit a single, ≈100 ns, mostly positive-pressure pulse that increases in amplitude with laser fluence. Different particle types emit different peak pressures, which are highest for SWCNTs, followed by CB nanoparticles and then MWCNTs, which does not correlate with cellular bioeffects between different particle types.

The aim of this population-based cohort study was therefore to test whether presence of acne vulgaris during late adolescence is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer later in life. We identified a large cohort of young men born in Sweden between 1952 and 1956, who underwent mandatory assessment for military conscription around the age of 18 (n = 243,187). Test information along with health data including medical diagnoses at time of conscription was available through the Swedish Military Conscription Register and the National Patient Register. The cohort was followed through linkages to the Swedish Cancer Register to identify the occurrence of prostate cancer until December 31, 2009. We used Cox regression to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between acne in adolescence and prostate cancer risk. A total of 1,633 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer during a median follow-up of 36.7 years. A diagnosis of acne was associated with a statistically significant increased risk for prostate cancer (adjusted HR: 1.43 95%; CI: 1.06-1.92), particularly for advanced stage disease (HR: 2.37 95%; CI 1.19-4.73). A diagnosis of acne classified as severe conferred a sixfold increased risk of prostate cancer (HR: 5.70 95% CI 1.42-22.85). Data from this large prospective population-based cohort add new evidence supporting a role of P. acnes infection in prostate cancer.""","""['Henrik Ugge', 'Ruzan Udumyan', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Ove Andrén', 'Scott Montgomery', 'Sabina Davidsson', 'Katja Fall']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Acne in late adolescence is not associated with a raised risk of subsequent malignant melanoma among men.', 'Appendicitis before Age 20 Years Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Later Prostate Cancer.', 'Acne and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

The authors updated these findings and examined survival by stage and race.  Methods:   The authors used data from the CONCORD-2 study for males (ages 15-99 years) who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 37 states, covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized. Data were presented for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting SEER Summary Stage 2000.  Results:   Among the 1,527,602 prostate cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, the proportion of localized cases increased from 73% to 77% in black males and from 77% to 79% in white males. Although the proportion of distant-stage cases was higher among black males than among white males, they represented less than 6% of cases in both groups between 2004 and 2009. Net survival exceeded 99% for localized stage between 2004 and 2009 in both racial groups. Overall, and in most states, 5-year net survival exceeded 95%.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer survival has increased since the first CONCORD study, and the racial gap has narrowed. Earlier detection of localized cancers likely contributed to this finding. However, racial disparities also were observed in overall survival. To help understand which factors might contribute to the persistence of this disparity, states could use local data to explore sociodemographic characteristics, such as survivors' health insurance status, health literacy, treatment decision-making processes, and treatment preferences.

All of them were followed up on levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and 68 of them completed a quality of life survey. The average age was 62.8 years and the average PSA was 6.4 ng/dl at the time of Br. 29.5% of patients were classified as intermediate risk, with a Gleason score sum of 7 and/or a PSA between 10 and 20 ng/dl.

Sexual function shows significant changes but all with favorable response using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This series of patients with PCa shows similar biochemical free survival rates BFSR in low risk patients to external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, but better BFSR in intermediate risk patients.

We computed age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years using the European Standard Population. Trends were assessed using JoinPoint regression analysis Software.  Results:   Age-standardized incidence rates were generally higher in Zurich compared to Ticino but the difference decreased over time.

A statistically significant increase was observed for men aged < 65 years, for grade 3 tumors, and for T-stage 2 and 3 tumors. The largest decrease was seen for grade 1 tumors. Furthermore, the incidence of tumors of unknown grade or T-stage decreased significantly in both regions.  Conclusions:   The trends in prostate cancer incidence rates were similar in both regions, although on a higher level in Zurich compared to Ticino. However, the difference decreased over time.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating cancer resistance. Here we aim to explore the role and mechanism of miR-199a in regulating prostate cancer resistance.  Methods:   MiR-199a expressions in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines were investigated with real-time PCR (RT-PCR). MiR-199a was ectopically overexpressed in PC3 cells, and resistance to paclitaxel (PTX) was evaluated consequently. The interaction between miR-199a and the oncogene Yamaguchi sarcoma viral homolog 1 (YES1) was assessed after miR-199a overexpression. YES1 was ectopically overexpressed, followed by evaluation of PTX resistance. The efficacy of miR-199a as a therapeutic agent was also investigated in vivo.  Results:   Downregulation of miR-199a was characteristic of prostate cancer, particularly recurrent cancers. MiR-199a was suppressed in PTX-resistant cell line. Overexpression of miR-199a inhibited PTX resistance. YES1 was a target of miR-199a, and overexpression of YES1 reversed the effect of miR-199a in suppressing PTX resistance. In vivo, miR-199a increased tumor PTX sensitivity.  Conclusions:   The downregulation of miR-199a contributes to PTX resistance in prostate cancer. YES1 mediates the regulation of miR-199a in prostate cancer PTX resistance.

Our investigation was conducted to describe the gene expression at primary tumour site in prostate cancer patients and correlate the results with Gleason Score and PSA level.  Methods:   Seventy-one samples were obtained from prostate cancer patients at the time of radical prostatectomy and palliative prostate resection (n = 71). Patients with benign prostate hyperplasia served as controls (n = 60). We performed real-time RT-PCR after microdissection of the samples.  Results:   The mRNA expression of RANK was highest in tumour tissue from patients with bone metastases (p < 0.001) as compared to BPH or locally confined tumours, also shown in clinical subgroups distinguished by Gleason Score (< 7 or ≥ 7, p = 0.028) or PSA level (< 10 or ≥ 10 µg/l, p = 0.004). RANKL and OPG mRNA expression was higher in tumour tissue from patients with metastatic compared to local disease. The RANKL/OPG ratio was low in normal prostate tissue and high tumours with bone metastases (p < 0.05). Expression of all three cytokines was high in BPH tissue but did not exceed as much as in the tumour tissue.  Conclusion:   We demonstrated that RANK, RANKL and OPG are directly expressed by prostate cancer cells at the primary tumour site and showed a clear correlation with Gleason Score, serum PSA level and advanced disease.

Previous studies suggest PA may be associated with lower PCa risk. However, it remains unclear whether PA is associated with smaller, less aggressive, and less advanced tumors. Thus, we sought to determine whether the presence and severity of baseline PA in men with initial biopsy negative for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with PCa volume at 2- and 4-year repeat biopsy.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 927 men 50-75-years-old with negative baseline biopsy and positive 2- or 4-year repeat biopsy for PCa in the Reduction by Dutasteride of PCa Events study. PA (present or absent), PA severity (mild or moderate/marked), and tumor volume were determined by central pathology. The association of baseline PA with repeat biopsy PCa volume was evaluated with linear and Poisson regressions in uni- and multivariable analyses.  Results:   PA was identified in 559 (60%) baseline biopsies and was mild in 491 (88%) and moderate/marked in 68 (12%). PA was associated with larger prostate volumes (P < 0.001). At 2-year biopsy, PA was associated with lower overall mean total tumor volume (2.21 vs. 2.94 µL; P = 0.016), mean number of biopsy cores involved (1.85 vs. 2.08; P = 0.016), mean percent of cores involved (18.4% vs. 20.7%; P = 0.008), average core involvement (0.23 vs. 0.29 µL; P = 0.019) and overall mean percent tumor involvement (1.82% vs. 2.33%; P = 0.018). Similar results were found in multivariable analysis and analysis of 4-year repeat biopsies. Compared to mild PA, moderate/marked PA was associated with greater reduction in tumor volume.

Using an immunocompetent cMyc-driven model (Myc-CaP), we sought to understand the immune infiltrate induced by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and to leverage that infiltration toward therapeutic benefit.  Methods:   Using flow cytometry, qPCR and IHC, we quantified ADT-induced immune infiltration in terms of cell type and function. Preclinical treatment studies tested the combinatorial effects of ADT and immune checkpoint blockade using tumor outgrowth and overall survival as end points.  Results:   ADT induces a complex pro-inflammatory infiltrate. This pro-inflammatory infiltrate was apparent in the early postcastration period but diminished as castration resistance emerged. Combining ADT with tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion using a depleting anti-CTLA-4 antibody significantly delayed the development of castration resistance and prolonged survival of a fraction of tumor-bearing mice. Immunotherapy as a monotherapy failed to provide a survival benefit and was ineffective if not administered in the peri-castration period.

In preclinical models, caloric restriction delays prostate cancer progression and prolongs survival. We sought to determine if weight loss (WL) in men with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy affects tumor apoptosis and proliferation, and if WL effects other metabolic biomarkers.  Methods:   In this Phase II prospective trial, overweight and obese men scheduled for radical prostatectomy were randomized to a 5-8 week WL program consisting of standard structured energy-restricted meal plans (1200-1500 Kcal/day) and physical activity or to a control group. The primary endpoint was apoptotic index in the radical prostatectomy malignant epithelium. Secondary endpoints were proliferation (Ki67) in the radical prostatectomy tissue, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio, body composition, and serum PSA, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, testosterone, estradiol, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, insulin-like growth factor 1, and IGF binding protein 1.  Results:   In total 23 patients were randomized to the WL intervention and 21 patients to the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly more weight loss (WL:-3.7 ± 0.5 kg; Control:-1.6 ± 0.5 kg; p = 0.007) than the control group and total fat mass was significantly reduced (WL:-2.1 ± 0.4; Control: 0.1 ± 0.3; p = 0.015). There was no significant difference in apoptotic or proliferation index between the groups. Among the other biomarkers, triglyceride, and insulin levels were significantly decreased in the WL compared with the control group.

The optimal half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ASC-J9® at various PCa cell confluences (20%, 50%, and 100%) were assessed via both short-term MTT growth assays and long-term clonogenic proliferation assays. Our results indicate that the IC50 values for ASC-J9® increased with increasing cell confluency. The IC50 values were significantly decreased in PCa AR-positive cells compared to PCa AR-negative cells or in normal prostate cells. This suggests that ASC-J9® may function mainly via targeting the AR-positive PCa cells with limited unwanted side-effects to suppress the surrounding normal prostate cells. Mechanism dissection indicated that ASC-J9® might function via altering the apoptosis signals to suppress the PCa AR-negative PC-3 cells. Preclinical studies using multiple in vitro PCa cell lines and an in vivo mouse model with xenografted castration-resistant PCa CWR22Rv1 cells demonstrated that ASC-J9® has similar AR degradation effects when dissolved in FDA-approved solvents, including DMSO, PEG-400:Tween-80 (95:5), DMA:Labrasol:Tween-80 (10:45:45), and DMA:Labrasol:Tween-20 (10:45:45).

Material and methods:   We enrolled patients with prior negative biopsy undergoing real time MRI/TRUS fusion guided prostate biopsy at our institute between 2014 and 2016.

Results:   The study included 74 men with a median age of 65 years, PSA level of 9.27ng/mL, and prostatic volume of 45ml. The overall PCa detection rate and the clinically significant cancer detection rate were 56.7% and 39.2%, respectively. Targeted cores demonstrated similar clinically significant PCa detection rate compared to systematic cores (33.8% vs. 28.4%, P=0.38) with significantly less tissue sampling. Indeed, a combination approach was significantly superior to a targeted-only in overall PCa detection (+16.7% overall detection rate, P=0.007). Although differences in clinically significant PCa detection were statistically non-significant (P=0.13), a combination approach did allow detecting 7 extra clinically significant PCas (+13.8%).

There was no difference in age, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, or contoured rectal volume between those who received SpaceOAR and those who did not. Patients who received SpaceOAR hydrogel had significantly lower dose to the rectum as measured by percent of contoured organ at risk (median, V80 < 0.005% vs. 0.010%, p = 0.003; V75 < 0.005% vs. 0.14%, p < 0.0005; V70 0.09% vs. 0.88%, p < 0.0005; V60 = 1.16% vs. 3.08%, p < 0.0005); similar results were seen for rectal volume in cubic centimeters.

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of miR-141-3p in bone metastasis of PCa are still unclear.  Methods:   miR-141-3p expression was examined in 89 non-bone metastatic and 52 bone metastatic PCa tissues by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the clinical correlation between miR-141-3p expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics in PCa patients. The biological roles of miR-141-3p in bone metastasis of PCa were evaluated both in vitro and a mouse intracardial model in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, Western blot, luciferase reporter and miRNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore and examine the relationship between miR-141-3p and its potential targets. Clinical correlation of miR-141-3p with its targets was examined in clinical PCa tissues.  Results:   miR-141-3p expression is reduced in bone metastatic PCa tissues compared with non-bone metastatic PCa tissues. Low expression of miR-141-3p positively correlates with serum PSA levels, Gleason grade and bone metastasis status in PCa patients. Furthermore, upregulating miR-141-3p suppresses the EMT, invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro. Conversely, silencing miR-141-3p yields an opposite effect. Importantly, upregulating miR-141-3p dramatically reduces bone metastasis of PC-3 cells in vivo. Our results further show that miR-141-3p inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling via directly targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5(TRAF5) and 6 (TRAF6), which further suppresses invasion, migration and bone metastasis of PCa cells. The clinical negative correlation of miR-141-3p expression with TRAF5, TRAF6 and NF-κB signaling activity is demonstrated in PCa tissues.

Little is known about its utility with tracking cancer incidence. This study aims to investigate the potential correlates of monthly internet search volume indexes (SVIs) and observed monthly age standardised incidence rates (ASRs) for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer.  Methods:   The monthly ASRs for the four cancers in Queensland were calculated using data from the Queensland Cancer Registry between January 2006 and December 2012. The monthly SVIs of the respective cancer search terms in Queensland were accessed from Google Trends for the same period. A time series seasonal decomposition method was performed to detect the seasonal patterns of SVIs and ASRs. Pearson's correlation coefficient and time series cross-correlation analysis were used to assess the associations between SVIs and ASRs. Linear regression models were used to examine the power of SVIs to predict monthly in ASRs.  Results:   Increases in the monthly ASRs of the four cancers were significantly correlated with increases in the monthly SVIs of the respective cancers except for colorectal cancer. The predictive power of the SVIs to explain variances in the corresponding ASRs varied by cancer type, with the percent explained ranging from 5.6% for breast cancer to 17.9% for skin cancer (SVI) with melanoma (ASR). Some improvement in the variation explained was obtained by including more search terms or lagged SVIs for the respective cancers in the linear regression models. The seasonal analysis indicated that the SVIs peaked periodically at around their respective cancer awareness months.  Conclusions:   Using SVIs from a popular internet search engine was only able to explain a small portion of changes in the respective ASRs. While an expanded regression model explained a higher proportion of variability, the interpretation of this was difficult. Further development and refinement of this approach will be needed before search-based cancer surveillance can provide useful information regarding resource deployment to guide cancer control and track the impact of cancer awareness and education programmes.""","""['Xiaodong Huang', 'Peter Baade', 'Danny R Youlden', 'Philippa H Youl', 'Wenbiao Hu', 'Michael G Kimlin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Association Between Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Web-Based Data in China: Infodemiology Study.', 'Bladder Cancer and Google Trends: Associations Between US Search Patterns and Disease Outcomes May Show Need for Improved Awareness Strategies.', 'Use of big data in the surveillance of veterinary diseases: early detection of tick paralysis in companion animals.', ""Population's health information-seeking behaviors and geographic variations of stroke in Malaysia: an ecological correlation and time series study."", 'Seasonality of hair loss: a time series analysis of Google Trends data 2004-2016.', 'Does seasonality affect snoring?

For multiple tumor types, loss of RB function is associated with poor clinical outcome. RB action is abrogated either by direct depletion or through inactivation of RB function; however, the basis for this selectivity is unknown. Here, analysis of tumor samples and cell-free DNA from patients with advanced prostate cancer showed that direct RB loss was the preferred pathway of disruption in human disease. While RB loss was associated with lethal disease, RB-deficient tumors had no proliferative advantage and exhibited downstream effects distinct from cell cycle control. Mechanistically, RB loss led to E2F1 cistrome expansion and different binding specificity, alterations distinct from those observed after functional RB inactivation. Additionally, identification of protumorigenic transcriptional networks specific to RB loss that were validated in clinical samples demonstrated the ability of RB loss to differentially reprogram E2F1 in human cancers. Together, these findings not only identify tumor-suppressive functions of RB that are distinct from cell cycle control, but also demonstrate that the molecular consequence of RB loss is distinct from RB inactivation. Thus, these studies provide insight into how RB loss promotes disease progression, and identify new nodes for therapeutic intervention.""","""['Christopher McNair', 'Kexin Xu', 'Amy C Mandigo', 'Matteo Benelli', 'Benjamin Leiby', 'Daniel Rodrigues', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Bram De Laere', 'Luc Dirix', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Fugen Li', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Johann de Bono', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Myles Brown', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['RB/E2F1 as a Master Regulator of Cancer Cell Metabolism in Advanced Disease.', 'Novel Oncogenic Transcription Factor Cooperation in RB-Deficient Cancer.', 'Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor pathway alterations in meningeal hemangiopericytomas: High E2F transcription factor 1 expression and loss of Rb expression: study by double immunofluorescence staining and laser-scanning confocal microscopy.', 'Life, death and E2F: linking proliferation control and DNA damage signaling via E2F1.', 'The E2F1/Rb and p53/MDM2 pathways in DNA repair and apoptosis: understanding the crosstalk to develop novel strategies for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Targeting B7-H3-A Novel Strategy for the Design of Anticancer Agents for Extracranial Pediatric Solid Tumors Treatment.', 'Significance of RB Loss in Unlocking Phenotypic Plasticity in Advanced Cancers.', 'TUBA1C: a new potential target of LncRNA EGFR-AS1 promotes gastric cancer progression.', 'CBX5 loss drives EGFR inhibitor resistance and results in therapeutically actionable vulnerabilities in lung cancer.', 'Activation of ONECUT2 by RB1 loss in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

In the present study, we have investigated the effects of NCur on growth, autophagia, and apoptosis in PC3 cells, respectively, by MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, and Flow cytometry. MTT assays revealed that the NCur at the concentration of 25 µg/mL for 48 h were able to exert a more pronounced effect on the PC3 cells as compared to free Cur. Apoptotic index was significantly increased in NCur-treated cells compared to free Cur. The percentage of autophagic cells (LC3-II positive cells) was also significantly increased in NCur treatment in comparison to free Cur. These data indicate that the NCur has considerable cytotoxic activity more than Cur on PC3 cell lines, which is mediated by induction of both apoptotic and autophagic processes.

The origin of inflammation is unknown, but microbial infections are suspected to play a role. In previous studies, the Gram-positive, low virulent bacterium Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes was frequently isolated from prostatic tissue. It is unclear if the presence of the bacterium represents a true infection or a contamination. Here we investigated Cutibacterium acnes type II, also called subspecies defendens, which is the most prevalent type among prostatic C. acnes isolates. Genome sequencing of type II isolates identified large plasmids in several genomes. The plasmids are highly similar to previously identified linear plasmids of type I C. acnes strains associated with acne vulgaris. A PCR-based analysis revealed that 28.4% (21 out of 74) of all type II strains isolated from cancerous prostates carry a plasmid. The plasmid shows signatures for conjugative transfer. In addition, it contains a gene locus for tight adherence (tad) that is predicted to encode adhesive Flp (fimbrial low-molecular weight protein) pili. In subsequent experiments a tad locus-encoded putative pilin subunit was identified in the surface-exposed protein fraction of plasmid-positive C. acnes type II strains by mass spectrometry, indicating that the tad locus is functional. Additional plasmid-encoded proteins were detected in the secreted protein fraction, including two signal peptide-harboring proteins; the corresponding genes are specific for type II C. acnes, thus lacking from plasmid-positive type I C. acnes strains. Further support for the presence of Flp pili in C. acnes type II was provided by electron microscopy, revealing cell appendages in tad locus-positive strains. Our study provides new insight in the most prevalent prostatic subspecies of C. acnes, subsp. defendens, and indicates the existence of Flp pili in plasmid-positive strains.

Electrochemical detection of biomarkers in urine has several significant advantages over circulating biomarker analysis including safety, cost, speed and ease of conversion to the point of care environment. Consequently, much current research is underway to identify urinary miRNA biomarkers for a variety of pathologies including prostate and bladder malignancies, and renal disorders. We describe here a robust method capable of electrochemical detection of human urinary miRNAs at femtomolar concentrations using a complementary DNA-modified glassy carbon electrode. A miR-21-specific DNA hybridisation probe was immobilised onto a glassy carbon electrode modified by sulfonic acid deposition and subsequent chlorination. In our pilot system, the presence of synthetic mature miR-21 oligonucleotides increased resistance at the probe surface to electron transfer from the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide electrolyte. Response was linear for 10 nM-10 fM miR-21, with a limit of detection of 20 fM, and detection discriminated between miR-21, three point-mutated miR-21 sequences, and miR-16. We then demonstrated similar sensitivity and reproducibility of miR-21 detection in urine samples from 5 human control subjects.

Herein, we address the question whether tumor cells with AR-V7 expression can be detected at the time of radical prostatectomy, that is, before long-term hormonal manipulation and castration resistance, and what the potential prognostic impact on the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival may be.  Methods:   An anti-AR-V7 antibody was first validated in a training set of prostate cancer specimens by a comparison of AR-V7 protein to AR-V7 mRNA expression. We then analyzed nuclear AR-V7 protein expression in the primary tumors and lymph node metastases from 163 predominantly high-risk patients (cohort I) as well as the primary tumors from patients of a second, consecutive patient cohort (n = 238, cohort II) not selected for any clinicopathological features. Staining results were correlated to patient characteristics and BCR-free patient survival.  Results:   High nuclear AR-V7 protein expression was detected in approximately 30%-40% of patients in cohort I and II at the time of radical prostatectomy. High baseline expression of nuclear AR-V7 protein was associated with an unfavorable BCR-free survival in the high-risk patient cohort I but not in the unselected consecutive cohort II. Remarkably, AR-V7 was an independent negative prognostic factor in high-risk prostate cancer patients of cohort I who were selected to receive adjuvant treatment.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer cells with high nuclear AR-V7 protein expression can be detected in a substantial proportion of tumors at the time of radical prostatectomy. The presence of AR-V7-positive tumor cells is associated with an unfavorable prognosis for BCR-free survival in a high-risk patient cohort including a subgroup of patients selected to receive adjuvant therapy, in which AR-V7 was an independent negative prognosticator. Overexpression of nuclear AR-V7 protein hence identifies a subset of tumors with remarkably aggressive growth characteristics among clinically and histologically high-risk patients at the time of radical prostatectomy.""","""['Xin Chen', 'Christof Bernemann', 'Yuri Tolkach', 'Martina Heller', 'Cathleen Nientiedt', 'Michael Falkenstein', 'Esther Herpel', 'Maximilian Jenzer', 'Carsten Grüllich', 'Dirk Jäger', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Anette Duensing', 'Sven Perner', 'Marcus V Cronauer', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Andres Jan Schrader', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of AR-V7 on Circulating Tumor Cells as a Treatment-Specific Biomarker With Outcomes and Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of AR-V7 and ARv567es in Circulating Tumor Cells Correlates with Outcomes to Taxane Therapy in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treated in TAXYNERGY.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cell-by-cell quantification of the androgen receptor in benign and malignant prostate leads to a better understanding of changes linked to cancer initiation and progression.', 'ORC6, a novel prognostic biomarker, correlates with T regulatory cell infiltration in prostate adenocarcinoma: a pan-cancer analysis.', 'The positive relationship between androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression and the risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A cumulative analysis.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 as a Biomarker of Clinical Response in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Currently, the accepted castrate level of serum testosterone is 50 ng/dL. Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC MSMS) is the appropriate method to measure testosterone, especially at low levels. However, worldwide, chemiluminescent assays (CLIAs) are used in clinical laboratories, despite their lack of accuracy and reproducibility, because they are automatable, fast, sensitive, and inexpensive.  Materials and methods:   We compared serum testosterone levels measured using LC MSMS and CLIAs in 126 patients with PCa undergoing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy.  Results:   The median serum testosterone level was 14.0 ng/dL (range, 2.0-67.0 ng/dL) with LC MSMS and 31.9 ng/dL (range, 10.0-91.6 ng/dL) with CLIA (P < .001). The serum testosterone levels, measured using LC MSMS, were < 20 ng/dL in 83 patients (65.9%), 20 to 50 ng/dL in 40 (31.7%), and > 50 ng/dL in 3 patients (2.4%). These ranges were found in 34 (27%), 72 (57.1%), and 20 (15.9%) patients when testosterone was measured using CLIA (P < .001). The castrate level of serum testosterone using LC MSMS and CLIA was 39.8 ng/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.1-43.4 ng/dL) and 66.5 ng/dL (95% CI, 62.3-71.2 ng/dL), respectively.  Conclusion:   We found that CLIA overestimated the testosterone levels in PCa patients undergoing LHRH agonist therapy. Thus, the castration level was incorrectly considered inadequate with CLIA in almost 15% of patients. The true castration level of serum testosterone using an appropriate method is < 50 ng/dL.""","""['Juan Morote', 'Inma Comas', 'Jacques Planas', 'Xavier Maldonado', 'Ana Celma', 'José Placer', 'Roser Ferrer', 'Joan Carles', 'Lucas Regis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Accuracy of serum luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone measurements to assess the efficacy of medical castration in prostate cancer patients.', 'Individual variation of hormonal recovery after cessation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in men receiving long-term medical castration therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Lower testosterone levels with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy than with surgical castration: new insights attained by mass spectrometry.', 'Risk of Testosterone Flare in the Era of the Saturation Model: One More Historical Myth.', 'Variations of serum testosterone levels in prostate cancer patients under LH-releasing hormone therapy: an open question.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Definition of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer: New Insights.', 'Serum Luteinizing Hormone Testing Can Identify Optimal Medical Castration.', 'A prospective study of the effect of testosterone escape on preradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics in prostate cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Effectiveness and Distribution of Testosterone Levels within First Year of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in a Real-World Setting: Results from the Non-Interventional German Cohort LEAN Study.']"""

However, its role in selecting patients clinically suitable for active surveillance (AS) is still in development. We aimed to find relevant mpMRI features that might be helpful for refinement of the selection of low-risk prostate cancer patients for AS. We also evaluated the interobserver variability in reporting prostate mpMRI features.  Patients and methods:   From 2008 to 2012, 135 patients were selected for AS using Epstein criteria. Baseline mpMRI studies were performed within 3 months of recruitment and reviewed by 2 radiologists who were unaware of the patients' outcomes. The radiologists recorded the mpMRI features using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines. The overall likelihood of the presence of significant prostate cancer was also determined using the Likert and PI-RADS, version 2 (v2), scores. Univariate and multivariate analyses, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for the mpMRI features with respect to patient withdrawal from the AS program and failure-free survival (FFS). The interobserver agreement was also evaluated.  Results:   At a median follow-up time of 31 months (range, 6-80 months), 84 patients (62.2%) were participating in the AS program. In 2 multivariate models, the variables significantly associated with outcomes for both readers were the index lesion size (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34 and 3.13, respectively) and overall PI-RADS, v2, score (HR, 2.51 and 3.21, respectively). The interobserver agreement was higher for the overall Likert and PI-RADS, v2, scores.  Conclusion:   Overall, the PI-RADS, v2, score and index lesion size were strongly associated with FFS.

Anterior dissection was troubled unexpectedly by outspoken fibrosis. For that reason, it was completed laparoscopically. We then continued with the laparoscopic total proctocolectomy. Last, a transanal circular stapled ileoanal anastomosis was created and a derivating ileostomy was installed.  Results:   Postoperative proctoscopy showed a patent ileoanal anastomosis. After removal of the Foley catheter on day 21, the patient was immediately continent. Prostate specimen revealed a pT2cN1M0 transmural invasive adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3 + 4). Pathology analysis of the rectum revealed a stage IIIc transmural invasive moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma (pT3N2bM0) with free margins. He was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods:   The DMAIC framework (process flow diagram, cause and effect, Pareto chart, control chart, and capability analysis) were utilized to determine the steps that need focus for improving the patient-specific QA. The patient-specific range QA plans were selected according to seven treatment site groups, a total of 1437 cases. The process capability index, Cpm was used to guide the tolerance design of patient site-specific range.  Results:   For prostate field, our results suggested that the patient range measurements were capable at the current tolerance level of ±1 mm in clinical proton plans. For other site-specific ranges, we analyzed that the tolerance tends to be overdesigned to insufficient process capability calculated by the patient-specific QA data. The customized tolerances were calculated for treatment sites. Control charts were constructed to simulate the patient QA time before and after the new tolerances were implemented. It is found that the total simulation QA time was decreased on average of approximately 20% after establishing new site-specific range tolerances. We simulated the financial impact of this project. The QA failure for whole process in proton therapy would lead up to approximately 30% increase in total cost.  Conclusion:   DMAIC framework can be used to provide an effective QA by setting customized tolerances.

Quantification of degree light localization in optical media is widely used for characterizing degree of structural disorder in that media. Recently, this light localization approach was extended to analyze structural changes in biological cell like heterogeneous optical media, with potential application in cancer diagnostics. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to construct ""optical lattices,"" which represents 2-dimensional refractive index map corresponding to the spatial mass density distribution of a selected molecule inside the cell. The structural disorder properties of the selected molecules were evaluated numerically using light localization strength in these optical lattices, in a single parameter called ""disorder strength."" The method showed a promising potential in differentiating cancerous and non-cancerous cells. In this paper, we show that by quantifying submicron scale disorder strength in the nuclear DNA mass density distribution, a wide range of control and cancerous breast and prostate cells at different hierarchy levels of tumorigenicity were correctly distinguished.

Methods:   Postal questionnaires were sent to 6559 PCa survivors 2-18 years post-diagnosis, identified through population-based cancer registries in Ireland. The Control Preference Scale was used to investigate respondents' 'actual' and 'preferred' role in TDM. The TDM experience was considered 'congruent' when actual and preferred roles matched and 'incongruent' otherwise. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to measure gHRQoL. Multivariate linear regression was employed to investigate associations between (i) actual role in TDM, (ii) congruence in TDM, and gHRQoL.  Results:   The response rate was 54% (n = 3348). The percentages of men whose actual role in TDM was active, shared or passive were 36, 33 and 31%, respectively. Congruence between actual and preferred roles in TDM was 58%. Actual role in TDM was not associated with gHRQoL. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical factors, survivors whose TDM experience was incongruent had significantly lower gHRQoL than those who had a congruent experience (- 2.25 95%CI - 4.09, - 0.42; p = 0.008). This effect was most pronounced among survivors who had more involvement in the TDM than they preferred (- 2.69 95%CI - 4.74, - 0.63; p = 0.010).  Conclusions:   Less than 6 in 10 PCa survivors experienced congruence between their actual and preferred roles in TDM. Having an incongruent TDM experience was associated with lower gHRQoL among survivors.

In controlled clinical studies, 0.5% (10 of 2051) of patients experienced seizure, but patients with a history of or risk factors for seizure were excluded. Men with mCRPC and seizure risk factors have an estimated seizure rate of 2.8 per 100 patient-years without enzalutamide exposure.  Objective:   To assess seizure incidence in patients with seizure risk factors who were receiving enzalutamide for mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   The UPWARD study (A Study to Evaluate the Potential Increased Risk of Seizures Among Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Enzalutamide) is an international, multicenter (73 sites in 20 countries), single-arm, open-label safety study in institutional practice. Data were collected from September 25, 2013, to February 1, 2016. Patients had at least 1 risk factor for seizure at baseline, including medications that lower seizure threshold, history of stroke, or history of seizure. Exclusion criteria included seizure (assessed by neurologic examination and history) requiring antiseizure medication within the past 12 months.  Intervention:   Treatment with oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/d.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the proportion of evaluable patients with 1 or more independently confirmed seizures during the 4-month study period; evaluable patients were defined as those who had 3 months or more of treatment or 1 or more confirmed seizures during this treatment period.  Results:   Of 423 patients with mCRPC receiving enzalutamide, 366 were evaluated. At baseline, risk factors for seizure included medications that lowered seizure threshold (242 of 423 patients [57.2%]), history of brain injury (112 [26.5%]), and history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (94 [22.2%]). Four of the 366 evaluable patients (1.1%) had at least 1 confirmed seizure within 4 months of enzalutamide initiation, and 3 (0.8%) additional patients experienced a seizure within 4 months following the 4-month study period. The incidence of confirmed seizure was 2.6 per 100 patient-years (7 seizures). Of the 423 patients receiving enzalutamide, 357 (84.4%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (an adverse event temporally related to the study treatment); 141 (33.3%) had at least 1 serious treatment-emergent adverse event, and 29 (6.9%) had at least 1 drug-related serious adverse event. Thirty-eight deaths (9.0%) were reported during treatment or within 30 days of drug discontinuation; 4 were considered possibly drug related.  Conclusions and relevance:   Incidence of seizure is similar in patients with mCRPC and similar seizure risk factors with or without enzalutamide exposure. The risk profile presented, along with the previously established efficacy of enzalutamide, suggests that enzalutamide can benefit patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing factors, but each patient should be closely monitored for the duration of treatment.""","""['Susan Slovin', 'William Clark', 'Joan Carles', 'Andrew Krivoshik', 'Jung Wook Park', 'Fong Wang', 'Daniel George']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Risk Factors for and Incidence of Seizures in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Real-World Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel: expanded access in North America.', 'Phase II trial of the PI3 kinase inhibitor buparlisib (BKM-120) with or without enzalutamide in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Practical guide to the use of enzalutamide.', 'Enzalutamide: a review of its use in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Addition of Enzalutamide to Leuprolide and Definitive Radiation Therapy Is Tolerable and Effective in High-Risk Localized or Regional Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: Results From a Phase 2 Trial.', 'Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Current Challenges and Trends.', 'Evolution of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Its New Emerging Modalities in Prostate Cancer: An Update for Practicing Urologists, Clinicians and Medical Providers.', 'Novel Treatment Strategy Using Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitors for Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

In younger patients with cancer, muscle mass and radiodensity are associated with treatment toxicity and OS. In this study, we investigated whether muscle mass, radiodensity, and strength were associated with treatment toxicity and OS in patients with advanced cancer aged 60 years or older.  Materials and methods:   Before starting palliative chemotherapy, muscle mass and radiodensity were assessed using computed tomography scans and muscle strength was assessed using a hydraulic hand grip dynamometer. Treatment toxicity was defined as any toxicity resulting in dose reduction and/or discontinuation of treatment. Multiple logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to study potential associations of muscle mass, radiodensity, and strength with treatment toxicity and OS, respectively.  Results:   The participants were 103 patients, with a mean age of 70 years, with advanced colorectal, prostate, or breast cancer. Muscle parameters were not significantly associated with treatment toxicity. Higher muscle strength was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.05). Muscle mass and radiodensity were not significantly associated with OS.  Conclusion:   Higher muscle strength at the start of palliative chemotherapy is associated with significantly better OS in older patients with advanced cancer. None of the investigated muscle parameters were related to treatment toxicity. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether muscle strength can be used for treatment decisions in older patients with advanced cancer.  Implications for practice:   This study in older patients with advanced cancer showed that adequate muscle strength is associated with longer overall survival. The results of this study imply that muscle strength might be helpful in estimating survival and therefore in identifying older patients who will benefit from anticancer treatment.""","""['Kathelijn Sophie Versteeg', 'Susanne Blauwhoff-Buskermolen', 'Laurien M Buffart', 'Marian A E de van der Schueren', 'Jacqueline A E Langius', 'Henk M W Verheul', 'Andrea B Maier', 'Inge R Konings']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Different methods for diagnosis of sarcopenia and its association with nutritional status and survival in patients with advanced cancer in palliative care.', 'Associations of Skeletal Muscle With Symptom Burden and Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With Advanced Cancer.', 'Skeletal muscle radiodensity is prognostic for survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Pharmacological Interventions to Improve Muscle Mass, Muscle Strength and Physical Performance in Older People: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses.', 'Superhuman Strength in Cancer.', 'Development and validation of a portable articulated dynamometry system to assess knee extensor muscle strength.', 'Differences in the Relationships Between Muscle Strength, Muscle Mass, Balance Function, and Quality of Life for Middle-Aged and Older Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'Physical and Quality of Life Changes in Elderly Patients after Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer-A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Functional Decline in the Cancer Patient: A Review.', 'Prognostic significance of the skeletal muscle index and systemic inflammatory index in patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer after radical mastectomy.']"""

However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying this has not been elucidated.  Methods:   Cell viability and cell cycle distribution were measured using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Flow cytometry assays, respectively. Cell invasion and migration were examined by Transwell invasion and wound healing assays. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the protein expressions of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). QRT-PCR was used to examine the levels of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) method was used to knockdown HOTAIR. Exogenously expressions of HOTAIR, DNMT1 and EZH2 were carried out by Transient transfection assays. EZH2 promoter activity was measured by Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. A nude mice xenograft model was used to confirm the findings in vitro.  Results:   We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth, induced cell cycle arrest of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In addition, PPI also reduced the migration and invasion in CRPC cells. In mechanism, we found that PPI decreased the protein expressions of EZH2, DNMT1 and levels of HOTAIR. Interestingly, silenced HOTAIR reduced EZH2 and DNMT1 protein expressions. On the contrary, exogenously expressed HOTAIR resisted PPI-inhibited EZH2 and DNMT1 protein expressions, EZH2 promoter activity and cell growth. Moreover, excessive EZH2 antagonized PPI-suppressed DNMT1 protein expression or vice versa. Consistent with this, PPI inhibited tumor growth, HOTAIR, the protein expressions of DNMT1 and EZH2 in vivo.  Conclusion:   Our results show that PPI inhibits growth of CRPC cells through inhibition of HOTAIR expression, subsequently; this results in the repression of DNMT1 and EZH2 expressions. The interactions among HOTAIR, DNMT1 and EZH2, and reciprocal regulation of DNMT1 and EZH2 contribute to the overall responses of PPI. This study reveals a novel mechanism for HOTAIR-mediated regulating DNMT1 and EZH2 in response to PPI in inhibition of the growth of CRPC cells.""","""['SongTao Xiang', 'PeiLiang Zou', 'Qing Tang', 'Fang Zheng', 'JingJing Wu', 'ZhiQiang Chen', 'Swei Sunny Hann']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj""","""['Inhibition of EZH2 via activation of SAPK/JNK and reduction of p65 and DNMT1 as a novel mechanism in inhibition of human lung cancer cells by polyphyllin I.', 'Crosstalk of NF-κB/P65 and LncRNA HOTAIR-Mediated Repression of MUC1 Expression Contribute to Synergistic Inhibition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Polyphyllin 1-Enzalutamide Combination Treatment.', 'Repression of PDK1- and LncRNA HOTAIR-Mediated EZH2 Gene Expression Contributes to the Enhancement of Atractylenolide 1 and Erlotinib in the Inhibition of Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'HOTAIR: An Oncogenic Long Non-Coding RNA in Human Cancer.', 'HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) in cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Polyphyllin I suppressed the apoptosis of intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus cells induced by IL-1β by miR-503-5p/Bcl-2 axis.', 'Epigenetically modified AP-2α by DNA methyltransferase facilitates glioma immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 expression.', 'The roles of EZH2 in cancer and its inhibitors.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOTAIR facilitates pulmonary vascular endothelial cell apoptosis via DNMT1 mediated hypermethylation of Bcl-2 promoter in COPD.']"""

We evaluated in our centre the capability and accuracy of radiation therapists to validate positioning images in a prospective study.  Methods and patients:   A total of 84 patients treated for prostate, head and neck, lung or breast cancer was prospectively and randomly included from July 2011 to July 2013 in radiotherapy unit of our institution. For each patient, three positioning images were randomly analysed. Two radiation oncologists analysed all positioning images and shifts decided by the radiation therapists in an independent and blinded way. The radiation oncologists had to decide whether to validate or not this shift and give a corresponding additional shift, if any. A theoretical disagreement rate less than 5% between radiation therapists and radiation oncologists was planned.  Results:   A total of 240 images were analysed (head and neck: 15.0%; prostate: 14.2%; breast: 55.0%; lung: 15.8%). The global disagreement between radiation oncologists and radiation therapists for all the images analysed was 2.5% 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [1.0-5.0], corresponding to six images out of 240.

Patients and methods:   This multicenter and retrospective study, assessed overall survival (OS), cancer specific survival (CSS) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (RFS), between January 2005 until December 2010 with 5 years of distance. We evaluated factors predicting long-term RFS in node positive prostate cancer patients.  Results:   Thus, 30 patients were included. Median follow-up was 89.9±27.4 months. After surgery, patients were treated with surveillance (n=4, 13.5%), adjuvant hormone therapy (n=22, 73%) or combination of radio and hormone therapy, (n=4, 13.5%). During the follow-up, 50% of patients had biochemical recurrence, with a mean time period of 38±30 months. Five and 10-year RFS were 57% and 41% respectively. Extra lymph nodes extension (P=0.00021) and pathological margin status (P=0.0065) were independent predictors of 5-year RFS.  Conclusion:   Biochemical RFS of patients treated with radical prostatectomy and subclinical lymph node metastatic disease is adequate and multifactorial. However, this study identifies pathological margin status and extra lymph node extension as independent factors of b RFS.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective study included 184 consecutively registered biopsy-naive patients in whom prostate cancer was suspected who were undergoing multiparametric prostate MRI. MR images were scored and evaluated by two readers using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and biparametric MRI TA in separate sessions. Interobserver agreement on PI-RADSv2 score and textural parameters of biparametric MRI was evaluated. The logistic regression model based on TA was built for different zones of the prostate. ROC analysis was used to compare the TA-based model with other parameters alone. The correlation of each parameter with Gleason score of high-grade prostate cancer was also assessed.  Results:   Reader reliability ranged from moderate to good for PI-RADSv2 (Cohen κ = 0.525-0.616) and from good to excellent for textural metrics (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.745-0.925). Diagnostic performance was significantly improved by use of the TA-based model (transition zone AUC, 0.87; peripheral zone AUC, 0.89) in comparison with PI-RADSv2 and other texture parameters alone. For the transition zone, entropy had moderate to good correlation with the Gleason score of high-grade prostate cancer (r = 0.562, p = 0.004). In the peripheral zone, entropy (r = 0.614, p = 0.003) and inertia (r = 0.663, p = 0.002) had moderate to good correlations with Gleason score.

STEAP-1 acts as a transporter protein or a putative channel between cancer cells while it has limited expression in normal human tissues. This protein has been suggested as an attractive target for prostate cancer immunotherapy.  Objective:   This study aimed at the development of a specific single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody against STEAP-1 epitope and testing the inhibitory effect of the selected scFv antibody in blocking gap junctions between tumor cells.  Method:   In the current study, a phage library was used and a specific scFv antibody was isolated against STEAP-1 epitope using panning process.  Results:   PCR and DNA fingerprinting of the obtained clones demonstrated a dominant pattern of a specific clone. Binding of the selected scFv to the corresponding target on PC3 and LNCaP cell lines was tested using ELISA and flow cytometry techniques. The inhibitory effect of the selected scFv antibody in blocking gap junctions between the cells was tested using intercellular communication assay. The selected antibody reacted with the corresponding epitope in ELISA and bound to prostate cancer cells with an intensity of 44.6% (PC3 cells) and 73.4% (LNCap cells) as shown by FACS analysis. Intercellular communication assay indicated that dye transfer between the cells in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines treated with 1000 scFv/cell was significantly inhibited (80-90%).

Here, we investigate patient-reported urinary function, bowel habits, and sexual function in patients following CyberKnife (CK) or Cryotherapy treatment, and compare them with active holistic surveillance (AHS) patients.  Methods:   An IRB-approved institutional database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent CK, Cryotherapy, or AHS. Quality of life (QoL) survey responses were collected every three months and the mean function scores were analyzed in yearly intervals over the 4 years post-treatment.  Results:   279 patients (767 survey sets) were included in the study. There was no difference among groups in urinary function scores. The CyberKnife group had significantly lower bowel habit scores in the early years following treatment (year 2 mean difference: -5.4, P < 0.01) but returned to AHS level scores by year 4. Cryotherapy patients exhibited initially lower, but not statistically significant, bowel function scores, which then improved and approached those of AHS. Both CyberKnife (year 1 mean difference: -26.7, P < 0.001) and Cryotherapy groups (-35.4, P < 0.001) had early lower sexual function scores relative to AHS, but then gradually improved and were not significantly different from AHS by the third year post-treatment. A history of hormonal therapy was associated with a lower sexual function scores relative to those patients who did not receive hormones in both CyberKnife (-18.45, P < 0.01) and Cryotherapy patients (-14.6, P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   After initial lower bowel habits and sexual function scores, CyberKnife or Cryotherapy-treated patients had no significant difference in QoL relative to AHS patients.

Increased tumoral 18F-FLT uptake compared with muscle was observed in both the SSM3 mammary tumors (2.4 ± 0.17 vs. 1.6 ± 0.14 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g at 2 h after injection, P = 0.006) and the CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts (0.34 ± 0.08 vs. 0.098 ± 0.033 %ID/g at 2 h after injection, P = 0.03). However, because of higher nonspecific muscle uptake in female mice, tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios were greater for CWR22 tumors than for SSM3 tumors (4.2 ± 0.78 vs. 1.5 ± 0.049 at 2 h after injection, P = 0.008). Sex-dependent differences in 18F-FLT uptake were also observed for MDA-MB-231 xenografts (tumor-to-muscle ratio, 7.2 ± 0.9 for female vs. 16.9 ± 8.6 for male, P = 0.039). Conversely, greater tumoral Ki-67 staining was observed in female mice (71% ± 3% for female vs. 54% ± 2% for male, P = 0.009), and this finding more closely matched the relative differences in absolute 18F-FLT tumor uptake values (4.5 ± 0.99 %ID/g for female vs. 1.9 ± 0.30 %ID/g for male, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Depending on whether female or male mice are used, differences in biodistribution and nonspecific tissue uptake can adversely affect quantitative measures of 18F-FLT uptake. Thus, sex is a potential variable to consider in defining quantitative imaging metrics using 18F-FLT to assess tumor proliferation.""","""['Szeman Ruby Chan', 'Kelley Salem', 'Justin Jeffery', 'Ginny L Powers', 'Yongjun Yan', 'Kooresh I Shoghi', 'Aparna M Mahajan', 'Amy M Fowler']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""[""Correlation of 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine uptake to cell proliferation in lung carcinoma xenografts."", 'Monitoring of therapy in androgen-dependent prostate tumor model by measuring tumor proliferation.', 'Assessment of PET tracer uptake in hormone-independent and hormone-dependent xenograft prostate cancer mouse models.', 'Correlation between Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and 18F-fluorothymidine uptake in patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""Preclinical Applications of 3'-Deoxy-3'-18FFluorothymidine in Oncology - A Systematic Review."", 'Feasibility of 18FFSPG PET for Early Response Assessment to Combined Blockade of EGFR and Glutamine Metabolism in Wild-Type KRAS Colorectal Cancer.', ""Synthesis and evaluation of 3'-18Ffluorothymidine-5'-squaryl as a bioisostere of 3'-18Ffluorothymidine-5'-monophosphate."", 'Recent Technical Advances in Accelerating the Clinical Translation of Small Animal Brain Imaging: Hybrid Imaging, Deep Learning, and Transcriptomics.', 'The Pharmacodynamics of Antipsychotic Drugs in Women and Men.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of Radiolabeled Peptides for PET Imaging of Glioblastoma Multiforme.']"""

Materials and methods:   We reviewed our institutional database of prostate MRI performed before radical prostatectomy between December 2014 and March 2016 (n = 236). We generated a logistic regression model based on observed final pathology results and the MSKCC nomogram predictions for organ-confined disease, extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node involvement (LNI) (""MSKCC only"").

Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the area under the curves (AUCs) were compared.  Results:   When independently examining the MSKCC nomogram predicted risk and the degree of prostate MRI suspicion, MRI was a predictor for ECE (odds ratio 2.8, P <.01) and LNI (odds ratio 5.6, P = .01). When examining the ""MSKCC + MRI"" and ""MSKCC only"" models, the incremental benefit in risk discrimination from the combined model (""MSKCC + MRI"") was not significant for organ-confined disease, ECE, seminal vesicle invasion, or LNI (ΔAUC +0.03, P = .10; ΔAUC +0.03, P = .08; ΔAUC 0.63, P = .63; ΔAUC +0.04, P = .42; respectively).

Here, we show that auriculasin, derived from Flemingia philippinensis, induces significant cell death and apoptosis via ROS generation in prostate cancer cells. Auriculasin treatment resulted in selective apoptotic cell death in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, characterized by DNA fragmentation, accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, increase of cytosolic apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG), in addition to inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Interestingly, auriculasin-induced apoptosis did not result in caspase-3, -8, and -9 activations. We found that auriculasin treatment decreased phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR/p70s6k in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, cellular ROS levels increased in LNCaP cells treated with auriculasin and blocking ROS accumulation with ROS scavengers resulted in inhibition of auriculasin-induced PARP cleavage, AIF increase, upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and decrease in AKT/mTOR phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that auriculasin targets ROS-mediated caspase-independent pathways and suppresses PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, which leads to apoptosis and decreased tumor growth.""","""['Hyun-Dong Cho', 'Ju-Hye Lee', 'Kwang-Deog Moon', 'Ki-Hun Park', 'Mi-Kyung Lee', 'Kwon-Il Seo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Food Chem Toxicol""","""['Auriculasin sensitizes primary prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of the DR5-dependent pathway.', 'Celastrol inhibits growth and induces apoptotic cell death in melanoma cells via the activation ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathway and the suppression of PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'Auriculasin enhances ROS generation to regulate colorectal cancer cell apoptosis, ferroptosis, oxeiptosis, invasion and colony formation.', 'An unexpected friend - ROS in apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation: Implications for regeneration and cancer.', 'Natural Products as the Modulators of Oxidative Stress: An Herbal Approach in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased ENT2 expression and its association with altered purine metabolism in cell lines derived from different stages of colorectal cancer.', 'Phytochemistry and pharmacology of natural prenylated flavonoids.', 'Astragaloside IV protects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced kidney injury based on the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Systematic Review of Potential Anticancerous Activities of Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae).']"""

The objective of this study is to determine if cancer-related risk factors mediate the association between race and cancer incidence.  Methods:   We performed prospective analysis of data from the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study, years 1995 through 2011. We compared differences in baseline characteristics between black and white participants using χ2 tests and Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate. We determined risk of any cancer and the most common cancer types (i.e., breast, prostate, and colorectal) using Cox Proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, marital status, education, health status, region, and adherence to guidelines on cancer-related risk factors (i.e., body mass index [BMI], smoking status, physical activity, nutrition, and alcohol consumption). We examined the mediation effect of cancer-related risk factors on the association between race and cancer incidence.  Results:   Among 425,152 participants, 16,110 (3.79%) were black, and 409,042 (96.21%) were white. The white participants were more likely to be aged 65 years and older (35.33% vs. 25.93%), male (60.88% vs. 42.67%), married (70.37% vs. 48.26%), reside in Western US (30.14% vs. 23.88%), be physically active (46.72% vs. 41.94%), and have higher adherence scores (3.14 vs. 3.04). Blacks had reduced risk of breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.74-0.90) but higher risk of prostate (adjusted HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.75-1.98) and colorectal cancer (adjusted HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.05-1.31) compared with whites. Nutrition mediated the association between race and breast cancer (6.35% mediated, P < .01), whereas BMI mediated the association between race and colorectal cancer (7.99% mediated, P < .01).

Hence, there is an urgent need to identify mechanisms of docetaxel chemoresistance and to develop new combination therapies.  Methods:   miR-193a-5p level was evaluated by qPCR in prostate tissues and cell lines, and its expression in the tissues was also examined by in situ hybridization. PC cell line (PC3 cell) was transfected with miR-193a-5p mimic or its inhibitor, and then cell apoptosis and the expression of its downstream genes Bach2 and HO-1 were detected by TUNEL staining and Western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the effect of miR-193a-5p and Bach2 on HO-1 expression. Xenograft animal model was used to test the effect of miR-193a-5p and docetaxel on PC3 xenograft growth.  Results:   miR-193a-5p was upregulated in PC tissues and PC cell lines, with significant suppression of PC3 cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Mechanistically, miR-193a-5p suppressed the expression of Bach2, a repressor of the HO-1 gene, by directly targeting the Bach2 mRNA 3'-UTR. Docetaxel treatment modestly decreased Bach2 expression and increased HO-1 level in PC3 cells, whereas a modest increase of HO-1 facilitated docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Notably, docetaxel-induced miR-193a-5p upregulation, which in turn inhibits Bach2 expression and thus relieves Bach2 repression of HO-1 expression, partly counteracted docetaxel-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression. Accordingly, silencing of miR-193a-5p enhanced sensitization of PC3 cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Finally, depletion of miR-193a-5p significantly reduced PC xenograft growth in vivo.

Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced forms but after few years the majority of patients progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a lethal form that poses considerable therapeutic challenges.  Methods:   Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, invasion and reporter assays, and in vivo studies were performed to characterize androgen resistant sublines phenotype in comparison to the parental cell line LNCaP. RNA microarray, mass spectrometry, integrative transcriptomic and proteomic differential analysis coupled with GeneOntology and multivariate analyses were applied to identify deregulated genes and proteins involved in CRPC evolution.  Results:   Treating the androgen-responsive LNCaP cell line for over a year with 10 μM bicalutamide both in the presence and absence of 0.1 nM 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) we obtained two cell sublines, designated PDB and MDB respectively, presenting several analogies with CRPC. Molecular and functional analyses of PDB and MDB, compared to the parental cell line, showed that both resistant cell lines were PSA low/negative with comparable levels of nuclear androgen receptor devoid of activity due to altered phosphorylation; cell growth and survival were dependent on AKT and p38MAPK activation and PARP-1 overexpression; their malignant phenotype increased both in vitro and in vivo. Performing bioinformatic analyses we highlighted biological processes related to environmental and stress adaptation supporting cell survival and growth. We identified 15 proteins that could direct androgen-resistance acquisition. Eleven out of these 15 proteins were closely related to biological processes involved in PCa progression.  Conclusions:   Our models suggest that environmental factors and epigenetic modulation can activate processes of phenotypic adaptation driving drug-resistance. The identified key proteins of these adaptive phenotypes could be eligible targets for innovative therapies as well as molecules of prognostic and predictive value.""","""['Nicoletta Ferrari', 'Ilaria Granata', 'Matteo Capaia', 'Marina Piccirillo', 'Mario Rosario Guarracino', 'Roberta Venè', 'Antonella Brizzolara', 'Andrea Petretto', 'Elvira Inglese', 'Martina Morini', 'Simonetta Astigiano', 'Adriana Agnese Amaro', 'Francesco Boccardo', 'Cecilia Balbi', 'Paola Barboro']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Network analysis of an in vitro model of androgen-resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Multifocal Signal Modulation Therapy by Celecoxib: A Strategy for Managing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A hnRNP K⁻AR-Related Signature Reflects Progression toward Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor co-regulatory networks in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase in solid tumors and other diseases: Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'TumorMet: A repository of tumor metabolic networks derived from context-specific Genome-Scale Metabolic Models.', 'Two calix4pyrroles as potential therapeutics for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.']"""

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, we aimed to assess cancer burden - incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - and attributable risk factors for Australia between 1990 and 2015, and to compare them with those of 34 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Methods:   The general GBD cancer estimation methods were used with data input from vital registration systems and cancer registries. A comparative risk assessment approach was used to estimate the population-attributable fractions due to risk factors.  Results:   In 2015 there were 198,880 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 183,908-217,365) estimated incident cancer cases and 47,562 (95% UI: 46,061-49,004) cancer deaths in Australia.

Methods:   This Swedish register study included men who died from 2009 to 2012 with prostate cancer as the underlying cause of death. We assessed the proportion who collected a prescription of androgen deprivation therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, glucocorticoids, antidepressants, anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics and the differences in treatment related to age, time since diagnosis, educational level, close relatives and comorbidities. Data were collected from 3 years before death from prostate cancer.  Results:   We included 8326 men.

Treatments for these diseases have not yet been established, although selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are considered as therapeutic targets. We previously reported that a novel SARM compound, SARM-2f, exhibits anabolic effect on muscles, with less stimulatory effect on prostate weight compared with testosterone, in rat Hershberger assays and cancer cachexia models. In this study, we studied the mechanism of action for SARM-2f selectivity and also assessed whether the muscle increase by this compound might lead to improvement of muscle function and physical activity. First, we examined the tissue distribution of SARM-2f. Tissue concentration was 1.2-, 1.6-, and 1.9-fold as high as the plasma concentration in the levator ani muscle, brain, and prostate, respectively. This result showed that the tissue-selective pharmacological effect did not depend on SARM-2f concentration in the tissues. The ability of SARM-2f to influence androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcriptional activation was examined by reporter assays using human normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and skeletal muscle cells (SKMC). SARM-2f exerted higher activity against AR in SKMC than in PrEC. Mammalian two hybrid assays showed different co-factor recruitment patterns between SARM-2f and dihydrotestosterone. Next, we studied the effect of SARM-2f on motivation and physical functions such as sexual behavior and motor activities in castrated rat or mouse models. SARM-2f restored the sexual behavior that was lost by castration in male rats. SARM-2f also increased voluntary running distance and locomotor activities. These results suggest that tissue-specific AR regulation by SARM-2f, but not tissue distribution, might account for its tissue specific androgenic effect, and that the muscle mass increase by SARM-2f leads to improvement of physical function. Together, these findings suggest that SARM-2f might represent an effective treatment for sarcopenia and cachexia.""","""['Megumi Morimoto', 'Yuichiro Amano', 'Masahiro Oka', 'Ayako Harada', 'Hisashi Fujita', 'Yukiko Hikichi', 'Ryuichi Tozawa', 'Masuo Yamaoka', 'Takahito Hara']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A selective androgen receptor modulator SARM-2f activates androgen receptor, increases lean body mass, and suppresses blood lipid levels in cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Prevention of body weight loss and sarcopenia by a novel selective androgen receptor modulator in cancer cachexia models.', 'A novel selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) MK-4541 exerts anti-androgenic activity in the prostate cancer xenograft R-3327G and anabolic activity on skeletal muscle mass & function in castrated mice.', ""Ockham's razor and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs): are we overlooking the role of 5alpha-reductase?"", 'Considerations, possible contraindications, and potential mechanisms for deleterious effect in recreational and athletic use of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) in lieu of anabolic androgenic steroids: A narrative review.', 'Identification and Synthesis of Selected In Vitro Generated Metabolites of the Novel Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) 2f.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators activate the canonical prostate cancer androgen receptor program and repress cancer growth.', 'Exogenous testosterone replacement therapy versus raising endogenous testosterone levels: current and future prospects.', 'A selective androgen receptor modulator SARM-2f activates androgen receptor, increases lean body mass, and suppresses blood lipid levels in cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Alteration of Testosterone Levels Changes Brain Wave Activity Patterns and Induces Aggressive Behavior in Rats.']"""

We provide the first data on long-term urinary continence, QoL and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after complete bladder neck preservation in a randomised controlled cohort.  Methods:   After approval by IRB, 199 men recruited for the randomised, controlled single-blind Heidelberger cBNP Study had prostatectomy performed with (cBNP) or without (noBNP) complete bladder neck preservation. Only men with renewed consent for this follow-up were evaluated for continence, QoL outcomes and BCR by ICIQ-SF self-assessment questionnaire, Pad-use/day and PSA levels. Students-t test, Pearson´s Chi-square, Fishers exact test and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied.  Results:   Mean follow-up was approx. 4 years. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between responders/non-responders or between study groups. We noted significantly higher continence rates (p = 0.004), less pad-use (p < 0.001), reduced frequency (p = 0.023) and amount (p = 0.009) of urine loss, and higher QoL outcomes (p = 0.012) after cBNP. A younger age positively influenced continence (OR = 0.91), but the multivariate analysis found cBNP to be the only independent predictor of continence (p = 0.008; OR = 8.1). pT stage was the only predictor for positive surgical margins (PSM; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in pT stage (p = 0.23) or BCR (p = 0.63) between study groups and also no significant correlation between BCR and presence (p = 0.26) or localisation (p = 0.11) of PSM, nerve sparing (p = 0.70), surgeon (p = 0.41), preoperative PSA (p = 0.53) or pT stage (p = 0.17).

We show that PKCη is required for the Treg-mediated suppression of tumor immunity in vivo. The presence of PKCη-deficient (Prkch-/-) Tregs in the tumor microenvironment was associated with a significantly increased expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on intratumoral CD103+ DCs, enhanced priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and greater levels of effector cytokines produced by these cells. Similar to mouse Tregs, the GIT/PAK/PIX complex also operated downstream of CTLA4 and PKCη in human Tregs, and GIT2 knockdown in Tregs promoted antitumor immunity.

Unravelling such disease genes is crucial to fully understand the genetic landscape of diseases on molecular level. With the advent of 'omic' data era, network-based methods have prominently boosted disease gene discovery. However, how to make better use of different types of data for the prediction of disease genes remains a challenge.  Results:   In this study, we improved the performance of disease gene prediction by integrating the similarity of disease phenotype, biological function and network topology. First, for each phenotype, a phenotype-specific network was specially constructed by mapping phenotype similarity information of given phenotype onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, we developed a gene gravity-like algorithm, to score candidate genes based on not only topological similarity but also functional similarity. We tested the proposed network and algorithm by conducting leave-one-out and leave-10%-out cross validation and compared them with state-of-art algorithms. The results showed a preference to phenotype-specific network as well as gene gravity-like algorithm. At last, we tested the predicting capacity of proposed algorithms by test gene set derived from the DisGeNET database. Also, potential disease genes of three polygenic diseases, obesity, prostate cancer and lung cancer, were predicted by proposed methods. We found that the predicted disease genes are highly consistent with literature and database evidence.  Conclusions:   The good performance of phenotype-specific networks indicates that phenotype similarity information has positive effect on the prediction of disease genes. The proposed gene gravity-like algorithm outperforms the algorithm of Random Walk with Restart (RWR), implicating its predicting capacity by combing topological similarity with functional similarity. Our work will give an insight to the discovery of disease genes by fusing multiple similarities of genes and diseases.""","""['Limei Lin', 'Tinghong Yang', 'Ling Fang', 'Jian Yang', 'Fan Yang', 'Jing Zhao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Constructing an integrated gene similarity network for the identification of disease genes.', 'Prioritization of candidate disease genes by enlarging the seed set and fusing information of the network topology and gene expression.', 'Network-based ranking methods for prediction of novel disease associated microRNAs.', 'Data fusion-based algorithm for predicting miRNA-Disease associations.', 'Network propagation: a universal amplifier of genetic associations.', 'Network analysis and the impact of Aflibercept on specific mediators of angiogenesis in HUVEC cells.', 'A Knowledge-Based Machine Learning Approach to Gene Prioritisation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.', 'Analysis of Topological Parameters of Complex Disease Genes Reveals the Importance of Location in a Biomolecular Network.', 'The Emerging Potential for Network Analysis to Inform Precision Cancer Medicine.']"""

However, immune checkpoint inhibition is successful only in subpopulations of patients emphasizing the need for powerful biomarkers that adequately reflect the complex interaction between the tumor and the immune system. Recently, recurrent copy number gains (CNG) in chromosome 9p involving PD-L1 were detected in many cancer types including lung cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer.  Methods:   Here, we applied functional genomics to analyze global mRNA expression changes associated with chromosome 9p gains. Using the TCGA data set, we identified a list of 75 genes that were strongly up-regulated in tumors with chromosome 9p gains across many cancer types.  Results:   As expected, the gene set was enriched for chromosome 9p and in particular chromosome 9p24 (36 genes and 23 genes). Furthermore, we found enrichment of two expression programs derived from genes within and beyond 9p: one implicated in cell cycle regulation (22 genes) and the other implicated in modulation of the immune system (16 genes). Among these were specific cytokines and chemokines, e.g. CCL4, CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, other immunoregulatory genes such as IFN-G and IDO1 as well as highly expressed proliferation-related kinases and genes including PLK1, TTK, MELK and CDC20 that represent potential drug targets.

Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate significant predictors of PAM. Propensity adjustments were undertaken before statistical analysis to minimize the lack of randomization.  Results:   ORP and RALP groups showed no significant differences in age, body mass index, PSA, biopsy and pathological GS, clinical and pathological stage, as well as prostatic apical shape variations.

However, whether miR-373 can activate the expression of E-cadherin in human bladder cancer (BCa) cells and inhibit cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that both miR-373 and E-cadherin were low expressed in BCa tissues and cell lines, and significantly correlated with tumor stage, grade, and lymph node metastasis. In addition, decreased E-cadherin expression or low expression of both miR-373 and E-cadherin is associated with poor overall survival in patients with BCa. Transfection of miR-373 into BCa cells readily activated E-cadherin expression by targeting promoter. Moreover, miR-373 exhibited robust capacity to inhibit cells proliferation, suppress migration and invasion by enhancing E-cadherin expression, and significantly suppress the growth of xenografts and metastasis in nude mice.

Reports on the contribution of the adaptive immune system are contradictive, since both suppression and acceleration of disease development have been reported. This study addresses the functional role of lymphocytes in prostate cancer development using a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of human c-Myc driven prostate cancer (Hi-Myc mice) combined with B and T cell deficiency (RAG1-/- mice). From a pre-cancerous stage on, Hi-Myc mice showed higher accumulation of immune cells in their prostates then wild-type mice, of which macrophages were the most abundant. The onset of invasive adenocarcinoma was delayed in Hi-MycRAG1-/- compared to Hi-Myc mice and associated with decreased infiltration of leukocytes into the prostate. In addition, lower levels of the cytokines CXCL2, CCL5 and TGF-β1 were detected in Hi-MycRAG1-/- compared to Hi-Myc mouse prostates. These results from a GEMM of prostate cancer provide new insights into the promoting role of the adaptive immune system in prostate cancer development. Our findings indicate that the endogenous adaptive immune system does not protect against de novo prostate carcinogenesis in Hi-Myc transgenic mice, but rather accelerates the formation of invasive adenocarcinomas.

Patients and methods:   Patients without a prior diagnosis of PCa, with elevated prostate-specific antigen and a normal digital rectal examination who underwent PHI testing prospectively prior to prostate biopsy were included in this study. PHID was calculated retrospectively using prostate volume derived from transrectal ultrasonography at biopsy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling, along with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, was used to determine the ability of serum biomarkers to predict clinically significant PCa (defined as either grade group [GG] ≥2 disease or GG1 PCa detected in >2 cores or >50% of any one core) on biopsy. Age, PNB status and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score were incorporated into the regression models.  Results:   Of the 241 men who qualified for the study, 91 (37.8%) had clinically significant PCa on biopsy. The median (interquartile range) PHID was 0.74 (0.44-1.24); it was 1.18 (0.77-1.83) and 0.55 (0.38-0.89) in those with and without clinically significant PCa on biopsy, respectively (P < 0.001). On univariable logistic regression, age and PNB status were associated with clinically significant cancer. Of the tested biomarkers, PHID demonstrated the highest discriminative ability for clinically significant disease (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.78 for the univariable model). That continued to be the case in multivariable logistic regression models incorporating age and PNB status (AUC 0.82). At a threshold of 0.44, representing the 25th percentile of PHID in the cohort, PHID was 92.3% sensitive and 35.3% specific for clinically significant PCa; the sensitivity and specificity were 93.0% and 32.4% and 97.4% and 29.1% for GG ≥2 and GG ≥3 disease, respectively. In the 104 men who underwent MRI, PI-RADS score was complementary to PHID, with a PI-RADS score ≥3 or, if PI-RADS score ≤2, a PHID ≥0.44, detecting 100% of clinically significant disease. For that subgroup, of the biomarkers tested, PHID (AUC 0.90) demonstrated the highest discriminative ability for clinically significant disease on multivariable logistic regression incorporating age, PNB status and PI-RADS score.  Conclusions:   In this contemporary cohort of men undergoing prostate biopsy for the diagnosis of PCa, PHID outperformed PHI and other PSA derivatives in the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer. Incorporating age, PNB status and PI-RADS score led to even further gains in the diagnostic performance of PHID. Furthermore, PI-RADS score was found to be complementary to PHID. Using 0.44 as a threshold for PHID, 35.3% of unnecessary biopsies could have been avoided at the cost of missing 7.7% of clinically significant cancers.

We repeated endoscopic ablation when symptoms and HLs recurred during the follow-up period. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free time. Secondary endpoints were a change in frequency, nocturia, and urgency episodes, and changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores and other symptom indices at follow-up visits.  Results:   A total of 72 patients were analysed. The median (range) follow-up period was 29.5 (12.0-50.0) months. After primary ablation treatment, HLs recurred in 75.0% (54/72) of patients, and the median (sd) recurrence-free time was 12.0 (1.6) months.

Methods:   This study used a microsimulation model of screening and active surveillance (AS), based on data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, for the natural history of prostate cancer and Johns Hopkins AS cohort data to inform the probabilities of referral to treatment during AS. A cohort of 10 million men, based on US life tables, was simulated. The lifetime costs and effects of screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years with different screening frequencies and AS protocols were projected, and their cost-effectiveness was determined.  Results:   Quadrennial screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years (55, 59, 63, and 67 years) with AS for men with low-risk cancers (ie, those with a Gleason score of 6 or lower) and yearly biopsies or triennial biopsies resulted in an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of $51,918 or $69,380, respectively. Most policies in which screening was followed by immediate treatment were dominated. In most sensitivity analyses, this study found a policy with which the cost per QALY remained below $100,000.  Conclusions:   Prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening in the United States between the ages of 55 and 69 years, as recommended by the USPSTF, may be cost-effective at a $100,000 threshold but only with a quadrennial screening frequency and with AS offered to all low-risk men.

The current study sought to define national trends in definitive prostate SBRT use and determine whether patterns vary by travel distance for treatment.  Methods:   The National Cancer Data Base identified 181,544 men with localized prostate cancer who were treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy from 2004 through 2012. Joinpoint regression analyzed definitive prostate SBRT trends over time, whereas multivariable logistic regression defined the odds for its receipt by travel distance for treatment.  Results:   Definitive prostate SBRT use increased from 1.8% in 2004 to 5.9% in 2012 (P for trend <.0001), with a joinpoint for increased use noted in 2006 (P<.0001). Higher SBRT use was found to be associated with longer travel distance for treatment, younger age, white race, more affluent zip code of residence, academic treatment center, favorable disease characteristics, and fewer comorbidities (all P<.0001). Compared with travel distances <25 miles for treatment, travel distances of 25 to 50 miles and >50 miles were associated with increasing adjusted odds of receipt of definitive prostate SBRT (1.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.51-1.76] and 2.35 [95% confidence interval, 2.14-2.57], respectively; both P < .0001).  Conclusions:   Definitive prostate SBRT use increased more than 3-fold since 2004, with a significant increase in use coinciding with early reports of short-term efficacy. Long-distance travel for treatment was associated with greater than twice the odds of receipt of definitive prostate SBRT compared with short-distance travel, suggesting that treatment decisions with unknown long-term clinical implications may be strongly driven by sociodemographic factors.

Methods:   The cohort included 1333 patients who underwent either lPLND (n = 902) or ePLND (n = 431) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at five institutions in Japan. All complications within 28 days of surgery were recorded, and clinical data were collected retrospectively. The outcomes and complications were compared relative to the extent of lymphadenectomy, and we conducted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the predictors of the major complications.  Results:   On multivariate analysis for evaluating the associations between major complications and perioperative characteristics, console time (p = 0.001) was significantly associated with major complications, although the extent of lymphadenectomy (p = 0.272) was not significantly associated with major complications. In the distribution of positive LNs removed in the extended pelvic lymphadenectomy cohort, 60.4% of patients had positive LNs only in the obturator/internal iliac region. However, 22.6% of the patients with positive LNs had no positive LNs in the obturator/internal iliac region, but only in the external/common iliac region.  Conclusions:   ePLND, which significantly increased the console time and blood loss but nearly quadrupled the lymph node yield, is considered a relatively safe and acceptable procedure. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that ePLND improves staging and removes a greater number of metastatic nodes.""","""['Shuichi Morizane', 'Masashi Honda', 'Satoshi Fukasawa', 'Atsushi Komaru', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Masatoshi Eto', 'Masaki Shimbo', 'Kazunori Hattori', 'Yoshiaki Kawano', 'Atsushi Takenaka']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Standardized comparison of robot-assisted limited and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'Assessment of required nodal yield in a high risk cohort undergoing extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy and its impact on functional outcomes.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients.

Materials and methods:   Between April and November 2016, four consecutive patients underwent the haemoprotection injection technique. For each patient, we recorded the time to perform the technique, the amount of injected blood, the achieved distances between the rectum and the prostate post-injection at fixed defined points (apex, middle, and base of prostate at the midline, left, and right sides of the gland), the extension of the ice ball outside the prostate capsule at those fixed points, and whether any residual blood was present on 1-month follow-up MRI.  Results:   Mean time to perform haemoprotection injection was 54 min, with an average blood volume of 103 cc. Mean distance achieved at the apex, middle, and base of the prostate, respectively, was 12, 13, and 16 mm in the midline; 8, 10, and 13 mm on the left side; and 9, 10, and 13 mm on the right side. The mean extension distance of the ice ball beyond the capsule was 4, 6, and 6 mm in the midline; 4, 5, and 6 mm on the left side; and 1, 3, and 3 mm on the right side.

The orientation of arrow-shaped RNA was altered to control ligand display on extracellular vesicle membranes for specific cell targeting, or to regulate intracellular trafficking of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA). Placing membrane-anchoring cholesterol at the tail of the arrow results in display of RNA aptamer or folate on the outer surface of the extracellular vesicle. In contrast, placing the cholesterol at the arrowhead results in partial loading of RNA nanoparticles into the extracellular vesicles. Taking advantage of the RNA ligand for specific targeting and extracellular vesicles for efficient membrane fusion, the resulting ligand-displaying extracellular vesicles were capable of specific delivery of siRNA to cells, and efficiently blocked tumour growth in three cancer models. Extracellular vesicles displaying an aptamer that binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen, and loaded with survivin siRNA, inhibited prostate cancer xenograft.

NLR can be calculated from simple, inexpensive peripheral blood samples. High NLR is a negative prognostic factor in a variety of malignancies including urological tumors. In this study, we aim to assess the prognostic value of preoperative neutrophil- lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Materials and methods:   Records of 7426 patients were retrospectively analyzed from prospectively collected datasets. A cut-off point of 3 was taken for NLR based on ROC analyses and previous literature.  Results:   23% (n = 1707) of patients had an NLR of ≥3. Patients with NLR ≥3 were more likely to harbor unfavorable pathological features such as higher biopsy Gleason score (GS), higher RP GS, higher rates of extra capsular extension, nodal involvement (all p < 0.001) and positive surgical margins (p = 0.002). On multivariable analyses, NLR ≥ 3 was associated with higher RP GS (OR 2.32; p < 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (OR 1.60; p < 0.001) and nodal involvement (OR 1.43; p < 0.001). On multivariable analyses, NLR ≥ 3 was significantly associated with GS upgrading at RP (OR 1.39 p < 0.001). During a median follow up of 45 months, NLR ≥ 3 was associated with higher risk of BCR (p = 0.001). However, on multivariable Cox regression analysis such association was not shown (HR 0.86; p = 0.4).  Conclusion:   Preoperative NLR ≥ 3 was associated with aggressive PCa, such as upgrading at RP. Even though its effect on clinical-decision making seems to be limited when all clinical and pathological confounders are taken into account, preoperative NLR may still be useful in selected patients to identify aggressive PCa helping patient selection for active surveillance protocols. Conversely, it does not predict BCR when adjusted for the effect of pathological features.""","""['Mehmet Özsoy', 'Marco Moschini', 'Harun Fajkovic', 'Francesco Soria', 'Christian Seitz', 'Tobias Klatte', 'Kilian Gust', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Morgan Roupret', 'Gero Kramer', 'Shahrokh F Shariat']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'High preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predicts biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'The values of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and/or prostate-specific antigen in discriminating real Gleason score\xa0≥\xa07 prostate cancer from group of biopsy-based Gleason score\xa0≤\xa06.', 'Prognostic Value of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Localized and Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Is the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio an Exceptional Indicator for Metabolic Syndrome Disease and Outcomes?', 'A high high-density lipoprotein level is associated with Gleason score upgrade in Chinese patients diagnosed with high-grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Clinical Predictors of Grade Group Upgrading for Radical Prostatectomy Specimens Compared to Those of Preoperative Needle Biopsy Specimens.', 'The Values of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictive value of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in localized prostate cancer: results from a surgical series at a high-volume institution.']"""

Given that NEPC exists as a spectrum, there may be men with adenocarcinoma who might benefit from platinum chemotherapy, particularly those men with DNA repair defects.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study of all of the men seen at Duke University since 2005 who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and were treated with a platinum agent. Data surrounding clinical features, histology, imaging, safety, and neuroendocrine transformation were collected. Scans were re-reviewed using RECIST v1.1 criteria to estimate responses as well as calculate radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS).  Results:   A database search identified 73 men with mCRPC treated with cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. There were three men with primary NEPC and small cell prostate cancer, and 14 with a NEPC transformation. In the first-line setting, 10 (63%) men with NEPC had a partial response (PR) compared with 14 (29%) of the men with adenocarcinoma (p = 0.017), with a median rPFS of 5.1 mo (3.1-7.8) and 4.3 mo (3.0-5.2 mo), respectively. The median overall survival was 8.5 mo (6.4-20.1 mo) for men with NEPC compared to 10.0 mo (8.0-14.4) in men with adenocarcinoma. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines meeting >30%, >50%, and >90% criteria from baseline were observed in 64/57/29% of NEPC patients (n = 14) treated with platinum chemotherapy vs. 48/30/14% of men with prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 50), respectively.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that NEPC histology enriches for platinum sensitivity, but that an important minority group (20-30%) of men with adenocarcinoma have a clinical benefit with platinum-based chemotherapy.

Prostate tumors invariably overexpress prostate surface membrane antigen (PSMA). We designed a nonviral vector, PEI-PEG-DUPA (PPD), comprising polyethylenimine-polyethyleneglycol (PEI-PEG) tethered to the PSMA ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), to treat PC. The purpose of PEI is to bind polyinosinic/polycytosinic acid (polyIC) and allow endosomal release, while DUPA targets PC cells. PolyIC activates multiple pathways that lead to tumor cell death and to the activation of bystander effects that harness the immune system against the tumor, attacking nontargeted neighboring tumor cells and reducing the probability of acquired resistance and disease recurrence. Targeting polyIC directly to tumor cells avoids the toxicity associated with systemic delivery. PPD selectively delivered polyIC into PSMA-overexpressing PC cells, inducing apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and the recruitment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PSMA-overexpressing tumors in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with partially reconstituted immune systems were significantly shrunken following PPD/polyIC treatment, in all cases. Half of the tumors showed complete regression. PPD/polyIC invokes antitumor immunity, but unlike many immunotherapies does not need to be personalized for each patient.

It is frequently found coincident with conventional acinar adenocarcinoma. The genomic features driving evolution to its ductal histology and the biology associated with its poor prognosis remain unknown.  Objective:   To characterize genomic features distinguishing ductal adenocarcinoma from coincident acinar adenocarcinoma foci from the same patient.  Design, setting, and participants:   Ten patients with coincident acinar and ductal prostate cancer underwent prostatectomy. Laser microdissection was used to separately isolate acinar and ductal foci. DNA and RNA were extracted, and used for integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Single nucleotide mutations, small indels, copy number estimates, and expression profiles were identified. Phylogenetic relationships between coincident foci were determined, and characteristics distinguishing ductal from acinar foci were identified.  Results and limitations:   Exome sequencing, copy number estimates, and fusion genes demonstrated coincident ductal and acinar adenocarcinoma diverged from a common progenitor, yet they harbored distinct alterations unique to each focus. AR expression and activity were similar in both histologies. Nine of 10 cases had mutually exclusive CTNNB1 hotspot mutations or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) alterations in the ductal component, and these were absent in the acinar foci. These alterations were associated with changes in expression in WNT- and PI3K-pathway genes.  Conclusions:   Coincident ductal and acinar histologies typically are clonally related and thus arise from the same cell of origin. Ductal foci are enriched for cases with either a CTNNB1 hotspot mutation or a PTEN alteration, and are associated with WNT- or PI3K-pathway activation.

Objective:   To assess the role of CNT in non-ccmRCC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2014), we identified patients with non-ccmRCC.  Intervention:   CNT versus no CNT in non-ccmRCC patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regression, cumulative incidence, competing-risks regression models, incremental survival benefit (ISB), conditional survival, and landmark analyses were performed. Sensitivity analyses focused on histological subtypes and most contemporary patients (2010-2014).  Results and limitations:   Of 851 patients with non-ccmRCC, 67.6% underwent CNT. In multivariable logistic regression, year of diagnosis in contemporary (p<0.001) and intermediate (p=0.008) tertiles, as well as age ≥75 yr (p<0.001) yielded lower CNT rates. Cumulative incidence showed 2-yr CSM of 52.6% versus 77.7%, respectively, after CNT versus no CNT. CSM after CNT versus no CNT was invariably lower in all histologic subtypes and in contemporary patients. Multivariable competing-risks regression models predicting CSM favored CNT (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, confidence interval: 0.30-0.47, p<0.001) in all patients and in all subgroups defined by histologic subtypes (HR: 0.14-0.43, all p≤0.02), as well as in contemporary patients (HR: 0.32, p<0.001). The ISB analyses yielded statistically significant and clinically meaningful CSM-free survival benefit of +3 mo after CNT versus no CNT in individuals with observed CSM-free survival ≤24 mo. The 2-yr CSM-free survival increased from baseline of 46.1% versus 19.4% (Δ=26.7%, p<0.001) to 70.3% versus 54.4% (Δ=15.9%, p=0.005) after CNT versus no CNT, in patients that survived 12 mo, respectively. Landmark analyses rejected bias favoring CNT. Data were retrospective.  Conclusions:   CSM is lower after CNT for non-ccmRCC in all histologic subtypes and in contemporary patients except for unproven ISB in collecting duct patients.

CYP17A1 is a validated drug target for prostate cancer as CYP17A1 inhibition significantly reduces circulating androgens and improves survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Germline CYP17A1 genetic variants with altered CYP17A1 activity manifesting as various endocrinopathies are extremely rare; however, characterizing these variants provides critical insights into CYP17A1 protein structure and function. By querying the dbSNP online database and publically available data from the 1000 genomes project (http://browser.1000genomes.org), we identified two CYP17A1 nonsynonymous genetic variants with unknown consequences for enzymatic activity and stability. We hypothesized that the resultant amino acid changes would alter CYP17A1 stability or activity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a HEK-293T cell-based expression system to characterize the functional consequences of two CYP17A1 variants, D216H (rs200063521) and G162R (rs141821705). Cells transiently expressing the D216H variant demonstrate a selective impairment of 16α-hydroxyprogesterone synthesis by 2.1-fold compared to wild-type (WT) CYP17A1, while no effect on 17α-hydroxyprogesterone synthesis was observed. These data suggest that substrate orientations in the active site might be altered with this amino acid substitution. In contrast, the G162R substitution exhibits decreased CYP17A1 protein stability compared to WT with a near 70% reduction in protein levels as determined by immunoblot analysis. This variant is preferentially ubiquitinated and degraded prematurely, with an enzyme half-life calculated to be ∼2.5 h, and proteasome inhibitor treatment recovers G162R protein expression to WT levels. Together, these data provide new insights into CYP17A1 structure-function and stability mechanisms.""","""['C P Capper', 'J Liu', 'L R McIntosh', 'J M Larios', 'M D Johnson', 'P F Hollenberg', 'Y Osawa', 'R J Auchus', 'J M Rae']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Structures of human steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1 with substrates.', 'Substrate-modulated cytochrome P450 17A1 and cytochrome b5 interactions revealed by NMR.', 'Human P450 CYP17A1: Control of Substrate Preference by Asparagine 202.', 'The diverse chemistry of cytochrome P450 17A1 (P450c17, CYP17A1).', 'The role of CYP17A1 in prostate cancer development: structure, function, mechanism of action, genetic variations and its inhibition.']"""

However, neither of these studies focused on men treated at low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Objective:   To test if the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on metastasis in patients undergoing early SRT varies according to prostate cancer (PCa) features.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 525 patients received SRT at PSA levels ≤2ng/ml.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed factors associated with metastasis. We tested the hypothesis that the impact of ADT varied according to the risk of metastasis. An interaction with groups (concomitant ADT vs no ADT) and the probability of distant metastasis according to a newly developed model was tested. A nonparametric curve explored the relationship between the risk of metastasis and 10-yr metastasis rates according to ADT.  Results and limitations:   Median PSA and radiotherapy dose were 0.42ng/ml and 66Gy, respectively. Overall, 178 (34%) patients received ADT. At a median follow-up of 104 mo, 71 patients experienced metastasis. Grade group ≥4 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.30), pT3b/4 (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.51-4.52), and dose (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.76-0.89) were associated with metastasis. The impact of ADT differed according to the risk of metastasis calculated using a multivariable model (p=0.01). This was confirmed when considering patients treated with early SRT (p=0.046), where ADT was associated with a reduction in the rate of metastasis only in eSRT; patients with more aggressive characteristics (ie, pT3b/4 and grade group ≥4, or pT3b/4 and PSA at eSRT ≥0.4ng/ml).  Conclusions:   The beneficial effect of ADT concomitant to eSRT varied significantly according to disease characteristics, such that only men with more aggressive PCa features benefit from ADT in the eSRT setting for BCR after RP.  Patient summary:   The oncological benefits of concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy (SRT) vary according to pathological characteristics.

It is used for the treatment of a variety of cancers such as cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, bladder and oesophageal, to name a few. However due to its expansive toxicity profile, patients receiving cisplatin can experience high frequency hearing loss, a side effect known as ototoxicity. The dearth of information on the extent and severity of cisplatin-associated ototoxicity in South Africa prevents the implementation of a context-specific audiological monitoring programme.  Methods:   This study aims to determine the extent and severity of ototoxicity amongst patients with cervical cancer, receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy and hence the feasibility of an ototoxicity monitoring program in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A concurrent mixed methods design will be employed in the study. This longitudinal study will involve interviewing oncology nurses, oncologists, pharmacists and audiologists to assess the level of awareness to ototoxicity, as well as conducting diagnostic audiological evaluations at regular intervals on 78 patients with cervical cancer to ascertain the progression of hearing loss during and after chemotherapy. The feasibility of the monitoring program will be assessed as a parallel process to the audiological evaluations, where patient outcomes and cost implications to the patient and the health sector will be considered. Data will be subjected to statistical analyses so as to strengthen knowledge in the field and inform appropriate policies, and healthcare providers.  Discussion:   This study is the first longitudinal study in South Africa to determine the ototoxic effects of cisplatin therapy on patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. Thus, the results generated from this study is likely to bring novel information to the fore using an evidence-based approach that will influence policy and clinical practice which can vastly improve the quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Mitigation of any further loss in the quality of life of affected patients is of paramount importance and the data generated from this project can lay the basis for further effective dialogue towards policy formulation on an ototoxic monitoring programme and the resultant strengthening of health systems in limited resource settings.""","""['J Paken', 'C D Govender', 'V Sewram']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Womens Health""","""['Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity amongst cervical cancer patients: A prospective cohort study in south Africa.', 'Feasibility and first results of a prospective cohort study to investigate cisplatin-associated ototoxicity amongst cancer patients in South Africa.', 'Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity: perspectives from a single institution cervical cancer cohort and implications for developing a locally responsive monitoring programme in a public healthcare setting.', 'Applying U.S. national guidelines for ototoxicity monitoring in adult patients: perspectives on patient populations, service gaps, barriers and solutions.', 'Ototoxicity: A review of South African studies.', 'A longitudinal study of the peripheral and central auditory pathways in individuals with acute lymphoid leukemia.', 'Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity amongst cervical cancer patients: A prospective cohort study in south Africa.', 'Feasibility and first results of a prospective cohort study to investigate cisplatin-associated ototoxicity amongst cancer patients in South Africa.', 'Baseline audiological profiling of South African females with cervical cancer: an important attribute for assessing cisplatin-associated ototoxicity.', 'Insight into the current practice of ototoxicity monitoring during cisplatin therapy.']"""

HepG2-C8 cells transfected with an antioxidant-response element (ARE)-luciferase vector were treated with F10, E10, curcumin, and sulforaphane (SFN) to compare their effects on Nrf2-ARE pathways. We performed real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting to investigate the effects of F10 and E10 on Nrf2, correlated phase II detoxification genes. We also measured expression and activity of DNMTand HDAC enzymes. Enrichment of H3K27me3 on the promoter region of Nrf2 was explored with a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Methylation of the CpG region in Nrf2 promoter was doubly examined by bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) and methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). Compared with curcumin and SFN, F10 is more potent in activating Nrf2-ARE pathways. Both F10 and E10 enhanced level of Nrf2 and the correlated phase II detoxifying genes. BGS and MeDIP assays indicated that F10 but not E10 hypomethylated the Nrf2 promoter. F10 also downregulated the protein level of DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC7 and the activity of DNMTs and HDACs. F10 but not E10 effectively reduced the accumulation of H3k27me3 on the promoter of Nrf2. F10 and E10 can activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway and increase the level of Nrf2 and correlated phase II detoxification genes.

KUD983, an enantiomerically pure β-dipeptide derivative, displays potent activity against hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) PC-3 and DU145 cells with submicromolar IC50. KUD983 induced G1 arrest of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis associated with down-regulation of several related proteins including cyclin D1, cyclin E and Cdk4, and the de-phosphorylation of RB. The levels of nuclear and total c-Myc protein, which could increase the expression of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E, were profoundly inhibited by KUD983. Furthermore, it inhibited PI3K/Akt and mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 pathways, the key signaling in multiple cellular functions. The transient transfection of constitutively active myristylated Akt (myr-Akt) cDNA significantly rescued KUD983-induced caspase activation but did not blunt the inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 signaling cascade suggesting the presence of both Akt-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, KUD983-induced effect was enhanced with the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (e.g., Bcl-2, and Mcl-1) and IAP family members (e.g., survivin).

Current therapies to block androgen receptor signaling act by inhibiting ligand production or binding. We developed bispecific antibodies capable of penetrating cells and binding androgen receptor outside of the ligand-binding domain. Half of the bispecific antibody molecule consists of a single-chain variable fragment of 3E10, an anti-DNA antibody that enters cells. The other half is a single-chain variable fragment version of AR441, an anti-AR antibody. The resulting 3E10-AR441 bispecific antibody enters human LNCaP prostate cells and accumulates in the nucleus. The antibody binds to wild-type, mutant and splice variant androgen receptor. Binding affinity of 3E10-AR441 to androgen receptor (284 nM) was lower than that of the parental AR441 mAb (4.6 nM), but could be improved (45 nM) through alternative placement of the affinity tags, and ordering of the VH and VK domains. The 3E10-AR441 bispecific antibody blocked genomic signaling by wild-type or splice variant androgen receptor in LNCaP cells. It also blocked non-genomic signaling by the wild-type receptor. Furthermore, bispecific antibody inhibited the growth of C4-2 prostate cancer cells under androgen-stimulated conditions. The 3E10-AR441 biAb can enter prostate cancer cells and inhibits androgen receptor function in a ligand-independent manner.

A total of 25 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 genes (PGR, ESR1, ESR2, CYP17A1, HSD17B1, CYP19A1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, COMT, UGT1A6, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, UGT2B15) were examined in whites only. Controls (n = 1380) were frequency matched to cases on age, PCPT treatment arm, and family history (n = 1506). Logistic regression models adjusted for age and family history were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) separately in the placebo and finasteride arms. SNPs associated with prostate cancer risk differed by treatment arm. The associations appeared to be modified by circulating estrogen and androgen levels. CYP19A1 was the only gene harboring SNPs that were significantly associated with risk in both the placebo and finasteride arms. Haplotype analysis with all three CYP19A1 SNPs genotyped (rs700518, rs2445765, rs700519) showed that risk-allele haplotypes are associated with the increased prostate cancer risk in both arms when comparing with the non-risk allele haplotype.

In this research paper, we have employed novel Machine learning techniques such as Bayesian approach, Support vector machine (SVM) kernels: polynomial, radial base function (RBF) and Gaussian and Decision Tree for detecting prostate cancer. Moreover, different features extracting strategies are proposed to improve the detection performance. The features extracting strategies are based on texture, morphological, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) features.

The Cross validation (Jack-knife k-fold) was performed and performance was evaluated in term of receiver operating curve (ROC) and specificity, sensitivity, Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR). Based on single features extracting strategies, SVM Gaussian Kernel gives the highest accuracy of 98.34% with AUC of 0.999.

However, the generalizability of published results across radiologists of varying expertise has not been verified.  Objective:   To assess variability in mpMRI reporting and diagnostic accuracy across radiologists of varying experience in routine clinical care.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men who underwent mpMRI and MR-fusion biopsy between 2014-2016. Each MRI scan was read by one of nine radiologists using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) and was not re-read before biopsy. Biopsy histopathology was the reference standard.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes were the PIRADS score distribution and diagnostic accuracy across nine radiologists. We evaluated the association between age, prostate-specific antigen, PIRADS score, and radiologist in predicting clinically significant cancer (Gleason ≥7) using multivariable logistic regression. We conducted sensitivity analyses for case volume and changes in accuracy over time.  Results and limitations:   We analyzed data for 409 subjects with 503 MRI lesions. While the number of lesions (mean 1.2 lesions/patient) did not differ across radiologists, substantial variation existed in PIRADS distribution and cancer yield. The significant cancer detection rate was 3-27% for PIRADS 3 lesions, 23-65% for PIRADS 4, and 40-80% for PIRADS 5 across radiologists. Some 13-60% of men with a PIRADS score of <3 on MRI harbored clinically significant cancer. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve varied from 0.69 to 0.81 for detection of clinically significant cancer. PIRADS score (p<0.0001) and radiologist (p=0.042) were independently associated with cancer in multivariable analysis. Neither individual radiologist volume nor study period impacted the results. MRI scans were not retrospectively re-read by all radiologists, precluding measurement of inter-observer agreement.  Conclusions:   We observed considerable variability in PIRADS score assignment and significant cancer yield across radiologists. We advise internal evaluation of mpMRI accuracy before widespread adoption.

Cancer cell metabolism has been in the centre of attention in therapeutical cancer cell targeting. Repurposed chemical agents, such as metformin and aspirin, have been studied extensively as preventive and therapeutic agents. Metformin is Food and Drug administration (FDA)-approved antidiabetic drug cheaper than other chemotherapeutic agents that were shown to have anticancer effects. Memantine is an FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug. Drug repositioning studies offer wide range of benefits, such as reduced time, cost and risk over de novo drug discovery. Therefore, we aimed to target glucose and glutamine metabolism in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells by using metformin and memantine and investigate these agents' effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We evaluated the effects of metformin and memantine on the protein expression levels of genes that play significant roles in apoptosis and cell cycle progression (Casp3, Casp9, Bcl-2, Survivin, Bax, c-Myc, HIF1A, CCND1, CDK4 and GAPDH) by Western blotting. Alzheimer's drug memantine exerted cytotoxic effects at 0.25 mM and metformin at 2.5 mM. We identified for the first time that memantine exerts antineoplastic activity (0.25 mM) by triggering Bax-dependent pathway of apoptosis. In addition to that both molecules have shown similar patterns on pro- and anti-apoptotic protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, Casp3, Survivin and Bax. Our preclinic results indicate that memantine might be used as a new repositioned drug in cancer treatment.

Methods:   Deep sequencing of the miRNA transcriptome of 14 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 60 cancerous and non-cancerous prostate samples extracted from 34 cancer-bearing prostates removed by prostatectomy was performed; of the latter 60 samples, 16, 21, and 23 samples contained <10%, >30%, and no dysplastic cells, respectively. The predictive value of selected miRNAs was then tested by quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (qRT-PCR), using two separate chemistries, Exiqon and Taqman, to evaluate the tissue samples obtained by prostatectomy. Validation experiments were also performed for a subset of miRNAs by qRT-PCR of 87 prostate core biopsies.  Results:   We identified 123 miRNAs significantly dysregulated in PCa (adjusted P-values <0.05); 110 and 13 miRNAs were dysregulated only in cancerous samples and non-cancerous samples extracted from cancer-bearing prostates, respectively, while 31 were dysregulated regardless of the dysplastic cell content of the studied specimens. The clinical utility of eight selected miRNAs was analyzed using the same sample set with two qRT-PCR chemistries. Measurable qRT-PCR signals were obtained for seven and six miRNAs using the Exiqon and Taqman chemistries, respectively, and expression levels of six and four of these miRNAs differed significantly between BPH and PCa samples, regardless of dysplastic cell content.

Design:   This study consisted of 415 Black men aged 40-81 years that entered the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry during the years 2007-2008. The primary outcome variable was depressive symptoms (CES-D). Factors included age, income, education, insurance status, treatment received, time between diagnosis and treatment, Gleason score, medical mistrust and experience with racism/discrimination. Logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the odds of having major depressive symptoms.  Results:   The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (≥16 on CES-D) among our sample of Black men with PCa was approximately 33%. Approximately 15% of the study participants underwent radiation beam treatment. Age was significantly associated with the odds of reporting major depressive symptoms (OR= .95, CI .91-.99) among Black men. In addition, compared with all other forms of treatment, Black men who underwent radiation beam treatment had higher odds (OR=2.38, CI 1.02- 5.51) of reporting major depressive symptoms.  Conclusion:   Nearly one-third of Black men with PCa in this study reported major depressive symptoms. Clinicians should pay closer attention to the mental health status of Black men with PCa, especially those who are younger and those who have undergone radiation beam treatment. Cancer survivorship, particularly quality of life, may be enhanced by opportunities for assessment, evaluation and intervention of depressive symptoms among these men disproportionately affected by PCa.""","""['Ballington L Kinlock', 'Lauren J Parker', 'Daniel L Howard', 'Janice V Bowie', 'Thomas A LaVeist', 'Roland J Thorpe Jr']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ethn Dis""","""['High Levels of Medical Mistrust Are Associated With Low Quality of Life Among Black and White Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'The influence of mistrust, racism, religious participation, and access to care on patient satisfaction for African American men: the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.', 'Treatment decisional regret among men with prostate cancer: Racial differences and influential factors in the North Carolina Health Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment Project (HCaP-NC).', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', 'Expanding the definition of quality of life for prostate cancer.', 'Association between Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer and Mental Health Outcomes.', 'Church Attendance and Mobility Limitation Among Black and White Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Effects of social support, hope and resilience on depressive symptoms within 18\xa0months after diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'An overview of cancer health disparities: new approaches and insights and why they matter.', 'Religious Coping and Quality of Life Among Black and White Men With Prostate Cancer.']"""

It is known that δ-tocotrienol (δ-T3) has displayed the most potent anti-cancer activity amongst the tocotrienols. On the other hand, γ-tocopherol (γ-Toc) is reported to have a protective effect against prostate cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of γ-Toc and δ-T3 could strengthen the inhibitory effect of δ-T3 on prostate cancer cell growth. In this study the effect of combined δ-T3 (annatto T3 oil) and γ-Toc (Tmix, γ-Toc-rich oil) therapy was assessed against human androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). We found that combined treatment of δ-T3 (10 μM) and γ-Toc (5 μM) resulted in reinforced anti-prostate cancer activity. Specifically, cell cycle phase distribution analysis revealed that in addition to G1 arrest caused by the treatment with δ-T3, the combination of δ-T3 with γ-Toc induced G2/M arrest. Enhanced induction of apoptosis by the combined treatment was also observed. These findings indicate that combination of δ-T3 and γ-Toc significantly inhibits prostate cancer cell growth due to the simultaneous cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and G2/M phase.""","""['Chiaki Sato', 'Saki Kaneko', 'Ayami Sato', 'Nantiga Virgona', 'Kozue Namiki', 'Tomohiro Yano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)""","""['Induction of caspase-independent programmed cell death by vitamin E natural homologs and synthetic derivatives.', 'Annatto Tocotrienol Induces a Cytotoxic Effect on Human Prostate Cancer PC3 Cells via the Simultaneous Inhibition of Src and Stat3.', 'α-Tocopherol suppresses antiangiogenic effect of δ-tocotrienol in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.', 'Synergistic Anticancer Effect of Tocotrienol Combined with Chemotherapeutic Agents or Dietary Components: A Review.', 'Natural forms of vitamin E and metabolites-regulation of cancer cell death and underlying mechanisms.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tocotrienol-Mediated Anticancer Properties: A Systematic Review of the Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Unfolded Protein Response.', 'γ-tocotrienol regulates gastric cancer by targeting notch signaling pathway.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Vitamin E Intake and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of the Anticancer Effects of Annatto Tocotrienol, Delta-Tocotrienol and Gamma-Tocotrienol on Chondrosarcoma Cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 120 patients with clinically low-intermediate risk prostate cancer were randomized to undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy via the posterior and anterior approach in 60 each. Surgery was performed by a single surgical team at an academic institution. An independent third party ascertained urinary and sexual function outcomes preoperatively, and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Oncologic outcomes consisted of positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence-free survival. Biochemical recurrence was defined as 2 postoperative prostate specific antigen values of 0.2 ng/ml or greater.  Results:   Median age of the cohort was 61 years and median followup was 12 months. At 12 months in the anterior vs posterior prostatectomy groups there were no statistically significant differences in the urinary continence rate (0 to 1 security pad per day in 93.3% vs 98.3%, p = 0.09), 24-hour pad weight (median 12 vs 7.5 gm, p = 0.3), erection sufficient for intercourse (69.2% vs 86.5%) or postoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men score 17 or greater (44.6% vs 44.1%). In the posterior vs anterior prostatectomy groups a nonfocal positive surgical margin was found in 11.7% vs 8.3%, biochemical recurrence-free survival probability was 0.84 vs 0.93 and postoperative complications developed in 18.3% vs 11.7%.  Conclusions:   Among patients with clinically low-intermediate risk prostate cancer randomized to anterior (Menon) or posterior (Bocciardi) approach robot-assisted radical prostatectomy the differences in urinary continence seen at 3 months were muted at the 12-month followup.

However, little is known about the long-term outcomes compared to that in men in the low risk Gleason score 6/Grade Group 1 group. We sought to clarify the risk of adverse features and oncologic outcomes in surgically treated, favorable Grade Group 2 vs 1 cases.  Materials and methods:   We queried our prospectively maintained radical prostatectomy database for all 8,095 patients with biopsy Grade Group 1 or 2 prostate cancer who otherwise fulfilled the NCCN low risk definition of prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml and cT2a or less, and who underwent radical prostatectomy from 1987 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare pathological and oncologic outcomes.  Results:   Organ confined disease was present in 93.9% and 82.6% of Grade Group 1 and favorable intermediate risk Grade Group 2 cases while seminal vesicle invasion was noted in 1.7% and 4.7%, and nodal disease was noted in 0.3% and 1.8%, respectively (all p <0.0001). On multivariable logistic regression biopsy proven Grade Group 2 disease was associated with a threefold greater risk of nonorgan confined disease (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7, p <0.001). The incidence of late treatment (more than 90 days from surgery) in Grade Group 1 vs 2 was 3.1% vs 8.5% for hormonal therapy and 6.0% vs 12.2% for radiation (p <0.001). In the Grade Group 1 vs 2 cohorts the 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 88.9% vs 81.2% and the 10-year systemic progression-free survival rate was 99% vs 96.5% (each p <0.001).

Where an experimental treatment is compared to a standard care control, much of this burden is potentially avoidable in the control group. We propose a ""just-in-time"" consent in which consent discussions take place in two stages: an initial consent to research from all participants and a later specific consent to randomized treatment only from those assigned to the experimental intervention. All patients are first approached and informed about research procedures, such as questionnaires or tests. They are also informed that they might be randomly selected to receive an experimental treatment and that, if selected, they can learn more about the treatment and decide whether or not to accept it at that time. After randomization, control patients undergo standard clinical consent whereas patients randomized to the experimental procedure undergo a second consent discussion. Analysis would be by intent-to-treat, which protects the trial from selection bias, although not from poor acceptance of experimental treatment. The advantages of just-in-time consent stem from the fact that only patients randomized to the experimental treatment are subject to a discussion of that intervention. We hypothesize that this will reduce much of the patient's burden associated with the consent process, such as decisional anxiety, confusion and information overload. We recommend well-controlled studies to compare just-in-time and traditional consent, with endpoints to include characteristics of participants, distress and anxiety and participants' understanding of research procedures.""","""['Andrew J Vickers', 'Danny A Young-Afat', 'Behfar Ehdaie', 'Scott Yh Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Trials""","""['Rejoinder.', 'Innovative approaches to informed consent for randomized clinical trials: Identifying the ethical challenges.', 'TwiC or treat?

Methods:   Data on TNM stage, Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, comorbidity and primary treatment were collected from medical records, as well as date and cause of death from Statistics Finland. Four prognostic risk groups were defined based on TNM stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for prostate cancer death were calculated using Cox regression and competing-risk analysis with follow up from randomization. The differences in the effects of prognostic factors were assessed using interaction terms.  Results:   The 15-year survival was significantly lower among cases in the control arm compared with the screening arm (0.90 vs 0.92). However, the survival advantage was limited to screen-detected cases (0.94 vs 0.91 in cases detected outside screening). The prognostic risk group was the strongest factor predicting survival in the control arm, but weaker in screen-detected cases. Advanced disease was associated with substantially poorer outcome in cases detected outside screening than in screen-detected disease. Primary treatment had a similar effect in all groups. Comorbidity had a small prognostic effect in the control arm only.  Conclusions:   Prognostic factors had a different effect on the outcome of cases detected through screening as those diagnosed otherwise. A high diagnostic prostate-specific antigen and advanced disease carried a poor prognosis, especially among the cases detected outside screening, even when lead-time was eliminated.

Factors that regulate methylation have been linked to human disease, yet how they contribute to malignancies remains largely unknown. Methylation of DNA can change the functional state of regulatory regions, but does not change the Watson-Crick base pairing of cytosine. Moreover, sequence symmetry of CpGs enables propagation of the methyl mark through cell division. This potential for inheritance coupled with the fact that DNA methylation patterns change during development and disease partially explains the interest in DNA methylation as a memory module. DNA methylation analysis also provides an opportunity to discover new and more powerful biomarkers that can help in clinical practice.Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) is likely the most widely used technique to study DNA methylation of a locus of interest. MSP can rapidly detect the methylation status of any group of CpG sites within a CpG island, not requiring methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. It also requires minute amounts of DNA, is very sensitive as it can detect <0.1% of methylated alleles in a specific locus, and can be used in different samples, including bodily fluids, and paraffin-embedded samples.""","""['João Ramalho-Carvalho', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Methylation-specific PCR.', 'Methylation-specific PCR.', 'Analysis of RET promoter CpG island methylation using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), pyrosequencing, and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM): impact on stage II colon cancer patient outcome.', 'Methylation-specific PCR unraveled.', 'Limitations and advantages of MS-HRM and bisulfite sequencing for single locus methylation studies.', 'An Overview: Genetic Tumor Markers for Early Detection and Current Gene Therapy Strategies.', 'SLC22A3 methylation-mediated gene silencing predicts adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Diet, Sports, and Psychological Stress as Modulators of Breast Cancer Risk: Focus on OPRM1 Methylation.', 'Integrative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and single-nucleotide polymorphism identified ACSM5 as a suppressor of lumbar ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.', 'Effects of hypoxia on DNA hydroxymethylase Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 in a KG-1 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line and its mechanism.']"""

Materials & methods:   Patients aged ≥70 years with, cT1-cT2 disease, biopsy Gleason score (GS) 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 and preoperative PSA ≤10 ng/mL were submitted to either whole-gland HIFU or MIRP. Propensity-score matching analysis was performed to ensure the baseline equivalence of groups. Follow-up visits were routinely performed assessing PSA and urinary function according to the International Continence Score (ICS) and the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaires. Estimated rates of salvage-treatment free survival (SFS) overall-survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and metastasis-free survival (MTS) were assessed and compared.  Results:   Overall, 84 (33.3%) and 168 (66.7%) patients were treated with HIFU and MIRP, respectively. MIRP was associated with a 5-yrs SFS of 93.4% compared to 74.8% for HIFU (p < 0.01).

However, the extent to which upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (U-DVT) is a marker of cancer and a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality remains poorly understood. We examined the risk of cancer after a diagnosis of U-DVT compared with cancer risk in the general population.  Materials and methods:   Using Danish nationwide population-based medical registries, we identified all patients with first-time U-DVT during 1980-1993 and 2000-2013. Cancer incidence was ascertained using data from the Danish Cancer Registry. We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) calculated as the observed number of cancers relative to the expected number based on national incidence rates by sex, age, and calendar year. We created a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without U-DVT, to assess the impact of U-DVT on all-cause mortality.  Results:   Among 1087 patients with U-DVT, 232 patients subsequently were diagnosed with cancer, corresponding to an overall SIR of 1.69 (95% confidence interval, 1.48-1.92). During the first 6months following U-DVT, the absolute risk of any cancer was 5.4%, corresponding to a 13-fold elevated SIR. During the subsequent 6-12months and >12months, the SIR remained 2-fold and 1.3-fold elevated, respectively. U-DVT was a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality in patients with lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer during the first 6months of follow-up.  Conclusion:   U-DVT was a marker of cancer.

Of significance in this regard is the considerable preclinical data, indicating that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of CRPC. However, the results of clinical studies using HDAC inhibitors (directed against HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) in CRPC are equivocal, a result that some have attributed to their ability to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neuroendocrine differentiation. We posited that it might be possible to uncouple the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors on AR signaling from their undesired activities by targeting specific HDACs as opposed to using the pan-inhibitor strategy that has been employed to date.  Methods:   The relative abilities of pan- and selective-Class I HDAC inhibitors to attenuate AR-mediated target gene expression and proliferation were assessed in several prostate cancer cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown approaches were used to confirm the importance of of HDAC 1, 2, and 3 expression in these processes. Further, the ability of each HDAC inhibitor to induce the expression of EMT markers (RNA and protein) and EMT-like phenotype(s) (migration) were also assessed. The anti-tumor efficacy of a HDAC3-selective inhibitor, RGFP966, was compared to the pan-HDAC inhibitor Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) in the 22Rv1 xenograft model.  Results:   Using genetic and pharmacological approaches we demonstrated that a useful inhibition of AR transcriptional activity, absent the induction of EMT, could be achieved by specifically inhibiting HDAC3. Significantly, we also determined that HDAC3 inhibitors blocked the activity of the constitutively active AR V7-splice variant and inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors expressing this protein.  Conclusions:   Our studies provide strong rationale for the near-term development of specific HDAC3 inhibitors for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Abigail B McLeod', 'James P Stice', 'Suzanne E Wardell', 'Holly M Alley', 'Ching-Yi Chang', 'Donald P McDonnell']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Combination treatment with docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulates androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CUDC-101, a Novel Inhibitor of Full-Length Androgen Receptor (flAR) and Androgen Receptor Variant 7 (AR-V7) Activity: Mechanism of Action and In Vivo Efficacy.', 'PXD101 potentiates hormonal therapy and prevents the onset of castration-resistant phenotype modulating androgen receptor, HSP90, and CRM1 in preclinical models of prostate cancer.', 'The potential of AR-V7 as a therapeutic target.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'High Histone Deacetylase 2/3 Expression in Non-Functioning Pituitary Tumors.', 'Vorinostat (SAHA) and Breast Cancer: An Overview.', 'Marine Power on Cancer: Drugs, Lead Compounds, and Mechanisms.', 'HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 controls bacterial growth and modulates macrophage signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.', 'Histone Deacetylases (HDACs): Evolution, Specificity, Role in Transcriptional Complexes, and Pharmacological Actionability.']"""

Interviews included eight questions related to patients' attitudes towards physical activity. Content analysis was conducted on the transcribed interview data. Twenty men with metastatic prostate cancer (mean age 71 ± 8.5 years; body mass index 30.19 ± 5.37 kg/cm2) and associated bone metastases (55% with > 2 regions affected) participated in the study.  Results:   Men's views towards physical activity were coded into the following major themes: (1) barriers to physical activity, (2) benefits of physical activity, (3) a reduction in physical activity levels post diagnosis and (4) social support for physical activity. Symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer and treatment side effects including pain and fatigue negatively influenced activity participation. In addition, many generic barriers to physical activity were described such as bad weather and a lack of suitable facilities for exercising in rural areas.  Conclusion:   Men living with metastatic prostate cancer have unique needs regarding physical activity related to symptoms of both their cancer and cancer treatment. There is a need to increase prompts that encourage those with metastatic prostate cancer to maintain/increase physical activity levels post diagnosis.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 141 consecutive patients were included who underwent at least one follow-up MRI after an initial PIRADS 3 finding. Changes in PIRADS score and the interval between the first and the follow-up MRI were recorded. An optimal duration was calculated.  Results:   Of all patients, 76.6% had a change from PIRADS 3 to either 2 or 4 in the first follow-up MRI. Reclassifications to PIRADS 4 happened earlier than reclassifications to PIRADS 2 (after 366.5 ± 217.9 days and after 534.2 ± 253.0 days, respectively). An optimal point of time for a follow-up to distinguish between changes to PIRADS 2 versus PIRADS 4 turned out to be 379 days (12.4 months, AUC 0.734, p = 0.0001). Of all patients with a PIRADS 3 lesion 14.8% harboured a prostate carcinoma.  Conclusion:   Performing follow-up mpMRI rather than immediate biopsy may be beneficial for patients with PIRADS 3, as most lesions can be reclassified after a manageable period of time.

Conclusions:   A detectable PSA is affected by factors associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Within men with persistent PSA, those with higher pathologic stage and who received adjuvant ADT are more likely to have CR.

The total bone uptake (TBU), which measures active bone metastatic burden, was calculated as the sum of [mean uptake obtained as standardized uptake value (SUV) above a cut-off level] × (the volume of the lesion) in the trunk using bone SPECT/CT. We studied the threshold value and utility of TBU in prostate cancer patients treated with radium-223 (Ra-223) therapy.  Methods:   To establish the threshold value of TBU, we compared bone metastatic and non-metastatic regions in 61 prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis and 69 without. Five fixed sites in each patient were selected as evaluation points and divided into bone metastatic and non-metastatic sites. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was applied to establish the threshold level. Using the obtained threshold value, we then calculated the TBU in nine prostate cancer patients who received Ra-223 therapy, and compared the results with the bone scan index (BSI) by BONENAVI® and visual evaluation of bone scintigraphy.  Results:   Uptake was significantly lower in non-metastatic sites in patients with bone metastasis than in patients without metastasis. Sensitivity and specificity analysis revealed SUV = 7.0 as the threshold level. There was a discrepancy between TBU and BSI change in two of the nine patients, in whom TBU change correlated with visual judgement, but BSI change did not. In two patients, BSI was nearly 0 throughout the course, but the TBU was positive and changed, although the change was not large. These results suggest that TBU may be more accurate and sensitive than BSI for quantitative evaluation of active bone metastatic burden.  Conclusion:   We established a threshold value (SUV > 7.0) for three-dimensional TBU for evaluating active bone metastatic burden in prostate cancer patients using bone SPECT/CT. Despite the small number of patients, we expect the change in TBU could be more accurate and sensitive than the change in BSI among patients who received Ra-223.""","""['Takuro Umeda', 'Mitsuru Koizumi', 'Shohei Fukai', 'Noriaki Miyaji', 'Kazuki Motegi', 'Shuto Nakazawa', 'Tomohiro Takiguchi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Evaluation of bone metastasis burden as an imaging biomarker by quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography for assessing prostate cancer with bone metastasis: a phantom and clinical study.', 'Bone scan index as metastatic bone disease quantifier and predictor of radium-223-dichloride biochemical response.', 'New index to assess the extent of bone disease in patients with prostate cancer using SPECT/CT.', 'Bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals including radium-223.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative 99mTcTc-MDP SPECT/CT correlated with 18FNaF PET/CT for bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'EANM practice guideline for quantitative SPECT-CT.', 'Volumetric analysis of mandibular lesions with SPECT/CT: a pilot clinical study of maximum standardized uptake value.', 'Satisfied quantitative value can be acquired by short-time bone SPECT/CT using a whole-body cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera.', 'Estimation of the lower limits for feasible Ra-223 SPECT imaging: a Monte Carlo simulation study.']"""

The current study examines this among men initially diagnosed with favorable-risk PCa and managed by active surveillance at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Canada and the Royal Marsden Hospital in the United Kingdom.  Methods:   Participants completed a questionnaire on daily participation in non-leisure, transport, and recreational PA. A logistic regression was employed using PA as the independent variable and whether the patient reclassified to higher-risk PCa while on active surveillance as the dependent variable. Demographic and lifestyle covariates were incorporated in the analysis to assess potential confounding and effect modification.  Results:   Men from both hospitals presented with similar clinical and demographic characteristics. Total PA was inversely associated with odds of reclassification while on active surveillance (p-trend = 0.027). A weaker inverse association was observed with recreational PA (p-trend = 0.30). Men who participated in weekly vigorous PA were less likely to reclassify than those who did not (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.42 (0.20-0.85)).

Novel therapeutic approaches require valid biomarkers for standardized disease staging and for evaluation of progression and therapy response. Here, we introduce EBONI (Evaluation of Bone Involvement), a software tool to automatically quantify the bone metastasis load in PSMA PET/CT. Lesion quantity, mean and maximum lesional SUV, z score, and percentage of affected bone volume are determined. EBONI is open source and freely available. Methods: To validate EBONI, the results of automated quantification of 38 PSMA PET/CT scans with different levels of bone involvement were compared with visual expert reading. The influence of SUV threshold and Hounsfield unit thresholds was analyzed. Results: A high correlation between bone lesion quantity as determined visually and automatically was found (SUVmax, r2 = 0.97; SUVmean, r2 = 0.88; lesion count, r2 = 0.97). The Hounsfield unit threshold had no significant influence, whereas an SUV threshold of 2.5 proved optimal for automated lesion quantification. The systematic error of false-positive tissue misclassification was low, occurred mainly around the salivary and lacrimal glands, and could easily be corrected. There were no false-negative ratings. Conclusion: EBONI analysis is robust, quick (<3 min per scan), and 100% reproducible. It allows rater-independent quantification of bone metastasis in metastatic prostate cancer. It provides lesion quantification equivalent to that of visual assessment, as well as providing complementary information. It can be easily implemented as an add-on to visual analysis of PSMA PET/CT scans and has the potential to reduce turnaround time.""","""['Jochen Hammes', 'Philipp Täger', 'Alexander Drzezga']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['qPSMA: Semiautomatic Software for Whole-Body Tumor Burden Assessment in Prostate Cancer Using 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT.', 'Oligometastases in prostate cancer : Metabolic response in follow-up PSMA-PET-CTs after hypofractionated IGRT.', 'Semiautomatically Quantified Tumor Volume Using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET as a Biomarker for Survival in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Utility of 68 Ga prostate specific membrane antigen - positron emission tomography in diagnosis and response assessment of recurrent renal cell carcinoma.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', 'Automated detection, delineation and quantification of whole-body bone metastasis using FDG-PET/CT images.', 'Systematic Review of Tumor Segmentation Strategies for Bone Metastases.', 'Automated quantification of PET/CT skeletal tumor burden in prostate cancer using artificial intelligence: The PET index.', 'Application of SPECT and PET / CT with computer-aided diagnosis in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Novel Framework for Treatment Response Evaluation Using PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (RECIP 1.0): An International Multicenter Study.']"""

However, resveratrol-induced nuclear accumulation of COX-2 enhances p53-dependent anti-proliferation in different types of cancers. Treatment with resveratrol leads to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and accumulation of nuclear COX-2 to complex with pERK1/2 and p53. The consequence is Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 (pSer15-p53), and induction of anti-proliferation in cancer cells. We investigated the mechanisms by which resveratrol-inducible COX-2 facilitates p53-dependent anti-proliferation in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Resveratrol treatment caused nuclear accumulation and complexing of ERK1/2, pSer15-p53 and COX-2 which was activated ERK1/2-dependent. Knockdown of SUMO-1 by shRNA also reduced nuclear accumulation of COX-2. Inhibition of nuclear accumulation by the COX-2 specific inhibitor, NS-398, inhibited co-localization of nuclear COX-2 and SUMO-1. Similar results were observed in the PD98059-treated cells. Finally, inhibition of SUMO-1 expression also reduced resveratrol-induced expression of pro-apoptotic genes but increased the expression of proliferative genes. In summary, these results demonstrate that inducible COX-2 associates with phosphorylated ERK1/2 to induce the phosphorylation of Ser-15 in p53 and then complexes with p53 and SUMO-1 which binds to p53-responsive pro-apoptotic genes to enhance their expression.

Objectives:   To illustrate the usability of two such techniques, timed automata (TA) and discrete event simulation (DES), for modeling personalized treatment decisions.  Methods:   An early health technology assessment on the use of circulating tumor cells, compared with prostate-specific antigen and bone scintigraphy, to inform treatment decisions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was performed. Both modeling techniques were assessed quantitatively, in terms of intermediate outcomes (e.g., overtreatment) and health economic outcomes (e.g., net monetary benefit). Qualitatively, among others, model structure, agent interactions, data management (i.e., importing and exporting data), and model transparency were assessed.  Results:   Both models yielded realistic and similar intermediate and health economic outcomes. Overtreatment was reduced by 6.99 and 7.02 weeks by applying circulating tumor cell as a response marker at a net monetary benefit of -€1033 and -€1104 for the TA model and the DES model, respectively. Software-specific differences were observed regarding data management features and the support for statistical distributions, which were considered better for the DES software. Regarding method-specific differences, interactions were modeled more straightforward using TA, benefiting from its compositional model structure.  Conclusions:   Both techniques prove suitable for modeling personalized treatment decisions, although DES would be preferred given the current software-specific limitations of TA. When these limitations are resolved, TA would be an interesting modeling alternative if interactions are key or its compositional structure is useful to manage multi-agent complex problems.""","""['Koen Degeling', 'Stefano Schivo', 'Niven Mehra', 'Hendrik Koffijberg', 'Rom Langerak', 'Johann S de Bono', 'Maarten J IJzerman']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Nonlinear Mixed-effect Models for Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics and Link with Survival in the Context of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comparison by Simulation of Two-stage and Joint Approaches.', 'Modeling Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer: Application and Validation of the Discrete Event Simulation Approach.', 'Comparing Strategies for Modeling Competing Risks in Discrete-Event Simulations: A Simulation Study and Illustration in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Precision medicine for advanced prostate cancer.', 'The use of circulating tumor cells in guiding treatment decisions for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Health Economic Evidence and Modeling Challenges for Liquid Biopsy Assays in Cancer Management: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Decision-analytic modeling for early health technology assessment of medical devices - a scoping review.', 'Health Economic Evidence for Liquid- and Tissue-based Molecular Tests that Inform Decisions on Prostate Biopsies and Treatment of Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Towards Routine Implementation of Liquid Biopsies in Cancer Management: It Is Always Too Early, until Suddenly It Is Too Late.', 'Addressing Challenges of Economic Evaluation in Precision Medicine Using Dynamic Simulation Modeling.']"""

Although histologic features mimic malignancy, diagnosis is usually straightforward due to the clinical context. We analyzed 21 specimens with vasitis or epididymitis nodosa with antibodies to PAX8, CD10, p63, α-methyl-acyl-coA-racemase (AMACR), GATA3, prostein, NKX3.1, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Two diagnostically problematic cases included (1) florid bladder muscle involvement after prostatectomy and (2) involvement of the ampulla and ejaculatory duct in a radical prostatectomy specimen. Vasitis nodosa was excluded in 3 additional histologic mimics (2 post-treatment prostate cancers and 1 bladder cancer). PAX8 yielded consistent positive (100%) nuclear staining in the proliferative glands of vasitis nodosa, often stronger and more uniform than native vas deferens. CD10 labeling was common but also labeled secretions and other structures. Labeling for p63 was often basally located in glands with a multilayered appearance, but often markedly attenuated or lacking in the proliferative glands compared to native epithelium.

This study sought to engage patients outside the clinical setting to better understand how they approach cancer screening decisions, including their primary concerns and their preferences for finalizing their decision.  Methods:   Twelve primary care practices offering patients an online personal health record invited eligible patients to complete a 17-item online interactive module. Among 11,458 registered users, invitations to complete the module were sent to adults aged 50-74 years who were overdue for colorectal cancer screening and to women aged 40-49 years and men aged 55-69 who had not undergone a recent mammogram or prostate-specific antigen test, respectively.  Results:   The module was started by 2,355 patients and completed by 903 patients. Most respondents (76.8%) knew they were eligible for screening. Preferred next steps were talking to the clinician (76.6%), reading/research (28.6%), and consulting trusted friends/family (16.4%). Priority topics included how much screening improves life expectancy, comparative test performance, and the prevalence/health risks of the cancer. Leading fears were getting cancer/delayed detection (79.2%), abnormal results (40.5%), and testing complications (39.1%), the last referring to false test results, medical complications, or unnecessary treatments. Men eligible for prostate-specific antigen screening were more likely than women eligible for mammography to express concerns about testing complications and to prioritize weighing pros and cons over gut feelings (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Although this sample was predisposed to screening, most patients wanted help in finalizing their decision. Many wanted to weigh the pros and cons and expressed fears of potential harms from screening. Understanding how patients approach decisions may help design more effective engagement strategies.""","""['Steven H Woolf', 'Alex H Krist', 'Jennifer Elston Lafata', 'Resa M Jones', 'Rebecca R Lehman', 'Camille J Hochheimer', 'Roy T Sabo', 'Dominick L Frosch', 'Brian J Zikmund-Fisher', 'Daniel R Longo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Prev Med""","""['Harnessing Information Technology to Inform Patients Facing Routine Decisions: Cancer Screening as a Test Case.', 'A patient recall program to enhance decisions about prostate cancer screening: a feasibility study.', 'Decision-making processes for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening: the DECISIONS survey.', 'Communicating benefits and risks of screening for prostate, colon, and breast cancer.', 'Key Elements of Mammography Shared Decision-Making: a Scoping Review of the Literature.', 'Opportunities and Challenges When Using the Electronic Health Record for Practice-Integrated Patient-Facing Interventions: The e-Assist Colon Health Randomized Trial.', 'Improving Depression Screening in Primary Care: A Quality Improvement Initiative.', 'Functions and Outcomes of Personal Health Records for Patients with Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review.', 'Out of reach?

Placement of a hydrogel spacer between the prostate and rectum has proven to reduce the volume of the rectum exposed to higher radiation dose levels in the setting of external beam radiotherapy. We present our findings with placing a rectal hydrogel spacer in patients following LDR brachytherapy, and we further assess the impact of this placement on dosimetry and acute rectal toxicity.  Methods and materials:   Between January 2016 and April 2017, 74 patients had placement of a hydrogel spacer, immediately following a Pd-103 seed-implant procedure. Brachytherapy was delivered as follows: as a monotherapy to 26 (35%) patients; as part of planned combination therapy with external beam radiotherapy to 40 (54%) patients; or as a salvage monotherapy to eight (11%) patients. Postoperative MRI was used to assess separation achieved with rectal spacer. Acute toxicity was assessed retrospectively using Radiation Oncology Therapy Group radiation toxicity grading system. Rectal dosimetry was compared with a consecutive cohort of 136 patients treated with seed implantation at our institution without a spacer, using a 2-tailed paired Student's t test (p < 0.05 for statistical significance).  Results:   On average, 11.2-mm (SD 3.3) separation was achieved between the prostate and the rectum. The resultant mean rectal volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose (V100%), dose to 1 cc of rectum (D1cc), and dose to 2 cc of rectum (D2cc) were 0 (SD 0.05 cc), 25.3% (SD 12.7), and 20.5% (SD 9.9), respectively. All rectal dosimetric parameters improved significantly for the cohort with spacer placement as compared with the nonspacer cohort. Mean prostate volume, prostate V100 and dose to 90% of gland (D90) were 29.3 cc (SD 12.4), 94.0% (SD 3.81), and 112.4% (SD 12.0), respectively. Urethral D20, D5cc, and D1cc were 122.0% (SD 17.27), 133.8% (SD 22.8), and 144.0% (SD 25.4), respectively. After completing all treatments, at the time of first the followup, 7 patients reported acute rectal toxicity-6 experiencing Grade 1 rectal discomfort and 1 (with preexisting hemorrhoids) experiencing Grade 1 bleeding.  Conclusions:   Injection of rectal spacer is feasible in the post-LDR brachytherapy setting and reduces dose to the rectum with minimal toxicity. Prostate and urethral dosimetries do not appear to be affected by the placement of a spacer. Further studies with long-term followup are warranted to assess the impact on reduction of late rectal toxicity.""","""['Amandeep S Taggar', 'Tomer Charas', ""Gil'ad N Cohen"", 'Keeratikarn Boonyawan', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Sean McBride', 'Nitin Mathur', 'Antonio L Damato', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Polyethylene glycol hydrogel rectal spacer implantation in patients with prostate cancer undergoing combination high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy.', 'Rectal spacing, prostate coverage, and periprocedural outcomes after hydrogel spacer injection during low-dose-rate brachytherapy implantation.', 'Improved rectal dosimetry with the use of SpaceOAR during high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'MRI findings of absorbable hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer therapy: a pictorial review.', 'Quality Metric to Assess Adequacy of Hydrogel Rectal Spacer Placement for Prostate Radiation Therapy and Association of Metric Score With Rectal Toxicity Outcomes.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Control charts for evaluation of quality of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prediction models for brachytherapy-induced rectal toxicity in patients with locally advanced pelvic cancers: a systematic review.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   From January 2015 to March 2016, rectal swabs of 557 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy were obtained from five institutions. Clinical variables, including demographics, rectal swab culture results and infectious complications, were evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify the risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance of rectal flora and infectious complications.  Results:   The incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was 48.1 and 11.8%, respectively. The most common fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria was Escherichia coli (81% of total fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, 39% of total rectal flora), and 16 (2.9%) patients had infectious complications. Univariable and multivariable analysis of clinical parameters affecting fluoroquinolone resistance showed no factor associated with fluoroquinolone resistance of rectal flora. The clinical parameter related to infectious complications after prostate biopsy was a history of operation within 6 months (relative risk 6.60; 95% confidence interval 1.99-21.8, P = 0.002).

Pseudogenes, which are non-coding homologs of protein-coding genes, were once considered non-functional evolutional relics. However, recent studies have shown that pseudogene transcripts can regulate their parental transcripts by sequestering shared microRNAs (miRNAs), thus acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). In this study, we utilize an unbiased screen to identify the ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) transcript and multiple FTH1 pseudogenes as targets of several oncogenic miRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa). We characterize the critical role of this FTH1 gene:pseudogene:miRNA network in regulating tumorigenesis in PCa, whereby oncogenic miRNAs downregulate the expression of FTH1 and its pseudogenes to drive oncogenesis. We further show that impairing miRNA binding and subsequent ceRNA crosstalk completely rescues the slow growth phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Our results also demonstrate the reciprocal regulation between the pseudogenes and intracellular iron levels, which are crucial for multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes. In summary, we describe an extensive gene:pseudogene network comprising multiple miRNAs and multiple pseudogenes derived from a single parental gene. The network could be regulated through multiple mechanisms to modulate iron storage in various signaling pathways, the deregulation of which results in PCa development and progression.""","""['Jia Jia Chan', 'Zhi Hao Kwok', 'Xiao Hong Chew', 'Bin Zhang', 'Chao Liu', 'Tuck Wah Soong', 'Henry Yang', 'Yvonne Tay']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['FTH1 Pseudogenes in Cancer and Cell Metabolism.', 'Pseudogenes regulate parental gene expression via ceRNA network.', 'Pseudogene-Derived lncRNAs and Their miRNA Sponging Mechanism in Human Cancer.', 'Pseudogenes as Competitive Endogenous RNAs: Testing miRNA Dependency.', 'Pseudogenes transcribed in breast invasive carcinoma show subtype-specific expression and ceRNA potential.', 'A novel view of ferritin in cancer.', 'Integrative Analysis and Experimental Validation of Competing Endogenous RNAs in Obstructive Sleep Apnea.', 'Mechanism of Tumor-Platelet Communications in Cancer.', 'Emerging role of miRNAs in the regulation of ferroptosis.', 'Development and validation of a prognostic prediction model for iron metabolism-related genes in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.']"""

We aimed to assess the benefit of MDT in a randomized phase II trial. Patients and Methods In this multicenter, randomized, phase II study, patients with asymptomatic PCa were eligible if they had had a biochemical recurrence after primary PCa treatment with curative intent, three or fewer extracranial metastatic lesions on choline positron emission tomography-computed tomography, and serum testosterone levels > 50 ng/mL. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either surveillance or MDT of all detected lesions (surgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy). Surveillance was performed with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) follow-up every 3 months, with repeated imaging at PSA progression or clinical suspicion for progression. Random assignment was balanced dynamically on the basis of two factors: PSA doubling time (≤ 3 v > 3 months) and nodal versus non-nodal metastases. The primary end point was androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival. ADT was started at symptomatic progression, progression to more than three metastases, or local progression of known metastases. Results Between August 2012 and August 2015, 62 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up time of 3 years (interquartile range, 2.3-3.75 years), the median ADT-free survival was 13 months (80% CI, 12 to 17 months) for the surveillance group and 21 months (80% CI, 14 to 29 months) for the MDT group (hazard ratio, 0.60 [80% CI, 0.40 to 0.90]; log-rank P = .11). Quality of life was similar between arms at baseline and remained comparable at 3-month and 1-year follow-up. Six patients developed grade 1 toxicity in the MDT arm.

Methods and materials:   Twenty consecutive patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer were treated with a single, 15-Gy HDR brachytherapy boost as part of this study. The treated plan was used as the study reference plan (PR). Three expert treatment planners (observers) manually reconstructed the catheter paths on the static three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound images, and new plans were generated from the updated positions (POBS); subsequently, the dwell time and positions from the POBS plans were superimposed on the PR catheter paths to evaluate the dosimetric effect of the interobserver variations (PEVAL). Plans from each group were stratified by observer and by number of catheters (12 or 16) and then compared using a one-way Kruskal-Wallis H test with post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests reserved for significant variations (α = 0.05).  Results:   Greater than 98.9% of catheter reconstruction variations were <3 mm. When stratified by observer, there was a significant decrease (p << 0.05) in planning target volume (PTV) V100% and increases in the urethral Dmax between the POBS plans propagated to the PR catheter paths and dosimetry evaluated and PR plans only. Stratification of plans by catheter number showed nonclinically significant decreases in PTV V100%, and D90% and increases in urethral Dmax for the 12-catheter plans.  Conclusions:   Limiting interobserver variability, and its effects on prostate HDR brachytherapy plan quality, is critical to achieving good dosimetric outcomes; small variations in catheter reconstruction may translate to inadequate PTV coverage, excessive urethral dose, or both.""","""['Alexandru Nicolae', 'Jure Murgic', 'Ivan Kruljac', 'Lior Dubnitzky', ""Laura D'Alimonte"", 'Lin Lu', 'Aaron Cumal', 'Niki Law', 'Gerard Morton', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Hans T Chung', 'Ananth Ravi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A novel urethral sparing technique for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'The effect of catheter displacement and anatomical variations on the dose distribution in MRI-guided focal HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Optical fibre sensors: their role in in vivo dosimetry for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Review of advanced catheter technologies in radiation oncology brachytherapy procedures.', 'Deep learning-based digitization of prostate brachytherapy needles in ultrasound images.']"""

Knowledge of regional differences and time trends in prostate cancer incidence may contribute to a better understanding of aetiologic factors and racial disparities in outcomes, and to improvements in preventive intervention and screening efforts. We used Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data on reported prostate cancer diagnoses between 2000 and 2011 to study the regional distribution and temporal trends of prostate cancer incidence in both Pennsylvania White males and Philadelphia metropolitan area Black males. For White males, we generated and mapped county-specific age-adjusted incidence and standardised incidence ratios by period cohort, and identified spatial autocorrelation and local clusters. In addition, we fitted Bayesian hierarchical generalised linear Poisson models to describe the temporal and aging effects separately in Whites state-wide and metropolitan Philadelphia blacks. Incidences of prostate cancer among white males declined from 2000-2002 to 2009-2011 with an increasing trend to some extent in the period 2006-2008 and significant variation across geographic regions, but less variation exists for metropolitan Philadelphia including majority of Black patients. No significant aging effect was detected for White and Black men, and the peak age group for prostate cancer risk varied by race. Future research should seek to identify potential social and environmental risk factors associated with geographical/racial disparities in prostate cancer. As such, there is a need for more effective surveillance so as to detect, reduce and control the cancer burden associated with prostate cancer.""","""['Ming Wang', 'Stephen A Matthews', 'Khaled Iskandarani', 'Yimei Li', 'Zheng Li', 'Vernon M Chinchilli', 'Lijun Zhang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Geospat Health""","""['Geographical, temporal and racial disparities in late-stage prostate cancer incidence across Florida: a multiscale joinpoint regression analysis.', 'Temporal and spatial trends and determinants of aggressive prostate cancer among Black and White men with prostate cancer.', 'Racial and Ethnic Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Philadelphia, PA: an Observational Study.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Age-related racial disparities in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Spatio-temporal mapping of breast and prostate cancers in South Iran from 2014 to 2017.', 'Spatial Autocorrelation of Breast and Prostate Cancer in Slovakia.']"""

Due to the rare occurrence of MBC, it remains to be established if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this study was to combine nationwide registers in four countries to assess the potential association between dispensed finasteride and MBC. A cohort of all males with dispensed finasteride in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden (1,365,088 person years) was followed up for up to 15 years for breast cancer, and compared to a cohort of males unexposed to finasteride. Individual-level register data included country, dates of dispensed finasteride, MBC diagnosis, and death. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution. An increased risk of MBC was found among finasteride users (IRR = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.11-1.88) compared to nonusers. The IRR increased to 1.60 (95% CI = 1.20-2.13) when users in Norway and Sweden with short follow-up time were excluded. The highest IRR was seen among men with medium duration of dispensed finasteride, medium accumulated consumption of finasteride, and among men with first dispensed finasteride prescription 1-3 years prior to diagnosis. The analyses suggested possible ascertainment bias and did not support a clear relationship between dispensed finasteride and MBC. In conclusion, a significant association between dispensed finasteride and MBC was identified.

IGF2 is a major embryonic growth factor and an important activator of IGF signaling. It is regulated by imprinting in a development- and tissue-dependent manner and has been implicated in a broad range of malignancies including prostate cancer (PCa). Loss of imprinting (LOI) usually results in bi-allelic gene expression and increased levels of IGF2. However, the regulatory mechanisms and the pathophysiological impact of altered IGF2 expression in PCa remain elusive. Here, we show that in contrast to many other tumors, IGF2 mRNA and protein levels were decreased in 80% of PCa in comparison with non-neoplastic adjacent prostate and were independent of LOI status. Instead, IGF2 expression in both tumors and adjacent prostate depended on preferential usage of the IGF2 promoters P3 and P4. Decreased IGF2 expression in tumors was strongly related to hypermethylation of these two promoters. Methylation of the A region in promoter P4 correlated specifically with IGF2 expression in the 20% of PCa where IGF2 was higher in tumors than in adjacent prostate. We conclude that IGF2 is downregulated in most PCa and may be particularly relevant during early stages of tumor development or during chemotherapy and androgen deprivation. PCa differs from other tumors in that IGF2 expression is mainly regulated through methylation of promoter-specific and not by imprinting. Targeting of promoter-specific regions may have relevance for the adjuvant treatment of PCa.""","""['Stefan Küffer', 'Tobias Gutting', 'Djeda Belharazem', 'Christian Sauer', 'Maurice S Michel', 'Alexander Marx', 'Lutz Trojan', 'Philipp Ströbel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Impairment of IGF2 gene expression in prostate cancer is triggered by epigenetic dysregulation of IGF2-DMR0 and its interaction with KLF4.', ""Alterations in the promoter-specific imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor-II gene in Wilms' tumor."", 'Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) loss of imprinting marks a field defect within human prostates containing cancer.', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) Signaling in Colorectal Cancer-From Basic Research to Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Epigenetic susceptibility factors for prostate cancer with aging.', 'The Interplay Between Non-coding RNAs and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of Neoplasia.', 'Alteration of Metabolic Conditions Impacts the Regulation of IGF-II/H19 Imprinting Status in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of DNA Methylation in the Resistance to Therapy in Solid Tumors.', 'Transcriptome profiling of Ewing sarcomas - treatment resistance pathways and IGF-dependency.', 'Long Noncoding MAGI2-AS3 Suppresses Several Cellular Processes of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells by Regulating miR-374a/b-5p/CADM2 Axis.']"""

Patients and methods:   From April 2012 to December 2016 consecutive men from our single institution, diagnosed with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer on transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy, were offered further staging with early mpMRI and TPB within 12 months of diagnosis. Data were collected prospectively. Eligibility criteria comprised: age ≤77 years; Gleason score ≤3 + 4; clinical stage T1-T2; PSA ≤15 ng/mL; and <50% positive biopsy cores.  Results:   A total of 208 men were enrolled, including 196 with Gleason score 3 + 3 and 12 with Gleason score 3 + 4 disease. The median (range) number of TPB cores was 50 (17-161), with a mean TPB core density of 1.2 cores/cm3 prostate volume. A total of 83 men (39.9%) underwent histopathological upgrading after TPB, including 76 men (38.8%) with Gleason score 3 + 3 disease and seven men (58.3%) with Gleason score 3 + 4 disease. Of these, 26 (31.3%) were found to harbour primary pattern Gleason grade ≥4 disease. In all, 24 (28.9%) upgraded cases had Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score 1 or 2 lesions on mpMRI, including five men with Gleason score ≥4 + 3 disease. Of these, 14 (58.3%) had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density of ≥0.15, including four out of the five men with Gleason ≥4 + 3 disease. Overall there was a change in prostate cancer management in 77 men (37.0%) after TPB.  Conclusions:   Early TPB during AS is associated with significant upgrading and a change in treatment plan in over a third of men.

However, the aggregation of colorectal and prostate cancer within families has not been well investigated.  Methods:   Analyses were conducted among participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) observational cohort, free of cancer at the baseline examination. Subjects were followed for colorectal cancer through August 31st, 2009. A Cox-proportional hazards regression modeling approach was used to estimate risk of colorectal cancer associated with a family history of prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and both cancers among first-degree relatives of all participants and stratified by race (African American vs. White).  Results:   Of 75,999 eligible participants, there were 1122 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed over the study period. A family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with an increase in colorectal cancer risk after adjustment for confounders (aHR =0.94; 95% CI =0.76, 1.15).

Results:   We have examined sixty patients with frontal baldness and 28 patients with vertex baldness. The subgroups did not differ significantly in age, BMI and as regards age of AGA onset, duration of AGA and comorbidities. The mean value of DHT in serum of the men with vertex baldness was higher than those in the men with frontal baldness with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The groups did not show significant differences in mean value of serum T and PSA levels, and DHT/T ratio.

The relationship between PROs and clinical outcomes is not well understood. We aim to elucidate the relationships between changes in PRO measures and clinical outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   We investigated relationships between changes in self-reported fatigue, pain, functional well-being (FWB), physical well-being (PWB) and prostate cancer-specific symptoms with overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) after 6 and 12 months of treatment in COU-AA-301 (N = 1195) or COU-AA-302 (N = 1088). Eligible COU-AA-301 patients had progressed after docetaxel and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤ 2. Eligible COU-AA-302 patients had no prior chemotherapy and ECOG PS 0 or 1. Patients were treated with abiraterone acetate (1000 mg/day) plus prednisone (10 mg/day) or prednisone alone daily. Association between self-reported fatigue, pain and functional status, and OS and/or rPFS, using pooled data regardless of treatment, was assessed. Cox proportional hazard regression modeled time to death or radiographic progression.  Results:   In COU-AA-301 patients, PRO improvements were associated with longer OS and longer time to radiographic progression versus worsening or stable PROs (P < 0.0001). In multivariate models, all except pain intensity remained associated with OS. Pain intensity, PWB and FWB improvements remained associated with rPFS. In COU-AA-302 patients, worsening PROs were associated with higher likelihood of radiographic progression (P ≤ 0.025) compared with improved or stable PROs. In multivariate models, worsening PWB remained associated with worse rPFS. The 12-month analysis confirmed the 6-month results.

We previously reported that reduction of histone marks regulated by DNMT1 following epidrug (5-Azacitidine, 5-Aza) treatment controls induction of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype, which facilitates tumorigenesis in PCa cells. Here, we use the epidrug 5-Aza as a model for how histone marks may regulate the reprogramming of prostate adenocarcinoma into NE phenotypic cells. First, we observed that 5-Aza treatment of PCa cells in vitro induces a neuron-like phenotype. In addition, significant increases in the expression of the NE markers N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), enolase-2 (ENO2), and synaptophysin were observed. Critically, a high density of NE cells with synaptophysin expression was found in tumors generated by 5-Aza pretreatment of PCa cells. Importantly, induction of NE differentiation of PCa cells was associated with an enhancement of NDRG1 expression by reduction of two histone marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Further, more NDRG1 expression was detected in the subset of PCa cells with reduced expression of H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 in the tumors generated by 5-Aza pretreated PCa cells and critically, these biological differences are also observed in small cell carcinoma in advanced stage of human primary PCa tumors.

In this study, we investigated whether CCR7 overexpression was associated with a decrease in the expression of miRNA Let-7a in invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cell. Synthetic Let-7a mimics and Let-7a inhibitors were transfected into prostate cancer PC-3 cells, respectively. Then Western blot was used to detect the expression of CCR7, ERK, p38, MMP-9, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related proteins. Matrigel invasion assays were performed to assess the migratory and invasive activities of PC3 cells. To confirm the fact that 3'UTR of CCR7 is a direct target of Let-7a, a luciferase assay for the reporter gene expressing the Let-7a binding sites of CCR7 3'UTR was used. Synthetic Let-7a mimics decreased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as the expression of CCR7, phospho-p38, phospho-ERK1/2, MMP-9, N-cadherin, and Snail in PC-3 cells. The Let-7a inhibitors reversed the effects of Let-7a on PC-3 cells. The 3'UTR of CCR7 was confirmed as a direct target of Let-7a by using the luciferase assay. All findings demonstrated that Let-7a/CCR7 axis regulated EMT progress in prostate cancer cells and mediated the tumor cell invasion and migration process via activation of P38/ERK signal pathway.

Here, we aimed to analyze the effects of long-term IL-4 treatment on CD44/CD49b expression, migration, proliferation, and clonogenic potential of basal-like PCa cells. To this end PC3 cells were treated over 30 passages with 5 ng/mL IL-4 (PC3-IL4) resulting in an increased population of CD44high expressing cells. This was concurrent with a clonal outgrowth of cuboid-shaped cells, with increased size and light absorbance properties. Flow cytometry revealed that the PC3-IL4 CD44high expressing subpopulation corresponds to the CD49bhigh population. Isolation of the PC3-IL4 CD44high /CD49bhigh subpopulation via fluorescence-associated cell sorting showed increased migrative, proliferative, and clonogenic potential compared to the CD44low /CD49blow subpopulation. In conclusion, IL-4 increases a PC3 subpopulation with tumor-initiating characteristics.

Limited human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry data is available for this tracer. The aim of this research was to determine the biodistribution and estimate the radiation dosimetry of [64Cu]CuCl2, using whole-body (WB) PET scans in healthy volunteers. Six healthy volunteers were included in this study (3 women and 3 men, mean age ± SD, 54.3 ± 8.6 years; mean weight ± SD, 77.2 ± 12.4 kg). After intravenous injection of the tracer (4.0 MBq/kg), three consecutive WB emission scans were acquired at 5, 30, and 60 min after injection. Additional scans were acquired at 5, 9, and 24 h post-injection. Low-dose CT scan without contrast was used for anatomic localization and attenuation correction. OLINDA/EXM software was used to calculate human radiation doses using the reference adult model.  Results:   The highest uptake was in the liver, followed by lower and upper large intestine walls, and pancreas, in descending order. Urinary excretion was negligible. The critical organ was liver with a mean absorbed dose of 310 ± 67 μGy/MBq for men and 421 ± 56 μGy/MBq for women, while the mean WB effective doses were 51.2 ± 3.0 and 61.8 ± 5.2 μSv/MBq for men and women, respectively.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [64Cu]CuCl2 in healthy volunteers.

Objective:   Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC).  Exposures:   Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation.  Main outcomes and measures:   The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor.  Results:   The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P < .001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC).  Conclusions and relevance:   In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints.

Its C-terminal sterile alpha motif domain (Ship2-Sam) associates with the Sam domain from the EphA2 receptor (EphA2-Sam). This interaction is expected to mainly induce pro-oncogenic effects in cells therefore, inhibition of the Ship2-Sam/EphA2-Sam complex may represent an innovative route to discover anti-cancer therapeutics. In the present work, we designed and analyzed several peptide sequences encompassing the interaction interface of EphA2-Sam for Ship2-Sam. Peptide conformational analyses and interaction assays with Ship2-Sam conducted through diverse techniques (CD, NMR, SPR and MST), identified a positively charged penta-amino acid native motif in EphA2-Sam, that once repeated three times in tandem, binds Ship2-Sam. NMR experiments show that the peptide targets the negatively charged binding site of Ship2-Sam for EphA2-Sam. Preliminary in vitro cell-based assays indicate that -at 50 µM concentration- it induces necrosis of PC-3 prostate cancer cells with more cytotoxic effect on cancer cells than on normal dermal fibroblasts. This work represents a pioneering study that opens further opportunities for the development of inhibitors of the Ship2-Sam/EphA2-Sam complex for therapeutic applications.""","""['Flavia Anna Mercurio', 'Concetta Di Natale', 'Luciano Pirone', 'Roberta Iannitti', 'Daniela Marasco', 'Emilia Maria Pedone', 'Rosanna Palumbo', 'Marilisa Leone']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Hunting for Novel Routes in Anticancer Drug Discovery: Peptides against Sam-Sam Interactions.', 'Sam domain-based stapled peptides: Structural analysis and interaction studies with the Sam domains from the EphA2 receptor and the lipid phosphatase Ship2.', 'Design and analysis of EphA2-SAM peptide ligands: A multi-disciplinary screening approach.', 'Structural investigation of a C-terminal EphA2 receptor mutant: Does mutation affect the structure and interaction properties of the Sam domain?', 'The Sam Domain of EphA2 Receptor and its Relevance to Cancer: A Novel Challenge for Drug Discovery?', 'Hunting for Novel Routes in Anticancer Drug Discovery: Peptides against Sam-Sam Interactions.', 'Biophysical characterization of the ETV6 PNT domain polymerization interfaces.', 'PTEN and Other PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Lipid Phosphatases in Breast Cancer.']"""

In this study, we investigated this phenomenon by stratifying cell subpopulations based on transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated or untreated with androgen after cell-cycle synchronization. Model-based clustering of 397 differentially expressed genes identified eight potential subpopulations of LNCaP cells, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation displayed stem-like features with a slower cell doubling rate, increased sphere formation capability, and resistance to G2-M arrest induced by a mitosis inhibitor. Advanced growth of this subpopulation was associated with enhanced expression of 10 cell-cycle-related genes (CCNB2, DLGAP5, CENPF, CENPE, MKI67, PTTG1, CDC20, PLK1, HMMR, and CCNB1) and decreased dependence upon androgen receptor signaling. In silico analysis of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas further demonstrated that concordant upregulation of these genes was linked to recurrent prostate cancers. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves implicates aberrant expression of these genes and could be useful for early identification of tumors that subsequently develop biochemical recurrence. Moreover, this single-cell approach provides a better understanding of how prostate cancer cells respond heterogeneously to androgen deprivation therapies and reveals characteristics of subpopulations resistant to this treatment.Significance: Illustrating the challenge in treating cancers with targeted drugs, which by selecting for drug resistance can drive metastatic progression, this study characterized the plasticity and heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells with regard to androgen dependence, defining the character or minor subpopulations of androgen-independent cells that are poised for clonal selection after androgen-deprivation therapy.

To our knowledge, none of the commercially available genomic biomarkers have been investigated in such men.  Objective:   To evaluate if a 22-gene genomic classifier can independently predict development of metastasis in men with PSA persistence postoperatively.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multi-institutional study of 477 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1990 and 2015 from three academic centers. Patients were categorized as detectable PSA (n=150) or undetectable (n=327) based on post-RP PSA nadir ≥0.1 ng/ml.  Outcome measurements and statisitical analysis:   Cumulative incidence curves for metastasis were constructed using Fine-Gray competing risks analysis. Penalized Cox univariable and multivariable (MVA) proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate the association of the genomic classifier with metastasis.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up for censored patients was 57 mo. The median time from RP to first postoperative PSA was 1.4 mo. Detectable PSA patients were more likely to have higher adverse pathologic features compared with undetectable PSA patients. On MVA, only genomic high-risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.02-19.41, p=0.001), detectable PSA (HR: 4.26, 95% CI: 1.16-21.8, p=0.03), and lymph node invasion (HR: 12.2, 95% CI: 2.46-70.7, p=0.003) remained prognostic factors for metastasis. Among detectable PSA patients, the 5-yr metastasis rate was 0.90% for genomic low/intermediate and 18% for genomic high risk (p<0.001). Genomic high risk remained independently prognostic on MVA (HR: 5.61, 95% CI: 1.48-22.7, p=0.01) among detectable PSA patients. C-index for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical score, Gandaglia nomogram, and the genomic classifier plus either Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical score or Gandaglia were 0.69, 0.68, and 0.82 or 0.81, respectively. Sample size was a limitation.  Conclusions:   Despite patients with a detectable PSA harboring significantly higher rates of aggressive clinicopathologic features, Decipher independently predicts for metastasis. Prospective validation of these findings is warranted and will be collected as part of the ongoing randomized trial NRG GU-002.

Although prolidase has a role in collagen metabolism, it is also used to evaluate OS in many diseases. However, there is a lack of data about serum prolidase activity (SPA) in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare SPA levels in males with BPH and PCa.  Methods:   Evaluation was made of a total of 81 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for a definitive diagnosis due to high PSA levels. Patients were separated into 2 groups as BPH and PCa patients. Pre-biopsy malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), PSA levels and serum prolidase activities (SPA) were compared between the groups and the correlations of SPA with the other parameters were also investigated in both groups.  Results:   BPH was diagnosed in 51 patients and PCa in 30. The mean age of patients was similar in both groups as 63.25 ± 5.81 years in the BPH group 65.30 ± 7.35 years in the PCa group(p:0.081). The median MDA and SOD levels were insignificantly increased in the PCa patients. SPA values were similar in BPH and PCa patients. SPA did not correlate with age, PSA, MDA or SOD levels in either group.

Materials and methods:   Six hundred forty-seven patients over 74 (≥75) were analyzed for preoperative factors (body mass index [BMI], American Society of Anestesiologists classification [ASA], prostate-specific antigen [PSA], International prostate symptome score [IPSS], International index of erectile function [IIEF]), operative and perioperative characteristics (technique, erythrocyte conc., complications), and histopathological results. After 12 months, following items were assessed: PSA, frequency of urine loss, number of pads used (including safety), incontinence at night, and potency as quantified by IIEF-5.  Results:   Mean age in the group <75 was 64.8 years (range 46-74 years) and in the group ≥75 76.9 years (75-88). No statistically significant differences could be detected in terms of BMI, ASA score, or preoperative PSA, respectively. IPSS and IIEF were significantly worse in the group ≥75. Major complications (>Clavien-Dindo III) were found in 1.6% vs. 1.3% (≥75) of cases. Minor complications were encountered in 22.8% vs. 26.3% (≥75). There was a remarkably high percentage of locally advanced disease (73.3% vs. 71.0%) in both groups. Patients ≥75 showed a tendency toward more aggressive cancer and more frequent nodal involvement; we found a higher percentage of R1-resections (19.5% vs. 30.4%, p < 0.05) and PSA relapse after 1 year (12.3% vs. 22.8%, p < 0.05). Twelve months pad-free continence rate (69.9% vs. 63.2%) showed no statistically significant difference between both groups as did the preservation rate of erectile function.  Conclusion:   We could show that robotic prostatectomy can be carried out safely with good functional and histopathological results in patients ≥75.

Loose-fill asbestos was used to insulate some houses in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). We compared the incidence of mesothelioma and other cancers in residents of the ACT who did and did not live in these houses.  Methods:   Our cohort study included all ACT residents identified using Medicare enrolment data. These data were linked to addresses of affected residential properties in the ACT to ascertain exposure. We followed up residents by linking data to the Australian Cancer Database and National Death Index. Outcomes were diagnosis of mesothelioma and selected other cancers. Effects were estimated for males and females separately using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), adjusting for age and calendar time of diagnosis.  Findings:   Between Nov 1, 1983, and Dec 31, 2013, 1 035 578 ACT residents were identified from the Medicare database. Of these, 17 248 (2%) had lived in an affected property, including seven (2%) of 285 people diagnosed with mesothelioma. The adjusted incidence of mesothelioma in males who had lived at an affected property was 2·5 times that of unexposed males (SIR 2·54, 95% CI 1·02-5·24). No mesotheliomas were reported among females who had lived at an affected property. Among individuals who had lived at an affected property, there was an elevated incidence of colorectal cancer in women (SIR 1·73, 95% CI 1·29-2·26) and prostate cancer in men (1·29, 1·07-1·54); colorectal cancer was increased, although not significantly, in males (SIR 1·32, 95% CI 0·99-1·72), with no significant increase in the other cancers studied.  Interpretation:   Residential asbestos insulation is likely to be unsafe. Our findings have important health, social, financial, and legal implications for governments and communities in which asbestos has been used to insulate houses.

However, the function of δ-catenin in lung carcinoma remains largely unknown. In the present study, we revealed that δ-catenin acts as an oncogene promoting the malignancy of lung adenocarcinoma. When δ-catenin proteins of Lewis lung cells were depleted by knocking out Ctnnd2 via CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the cells lost the tumorigenic and metastatic abilities in vivo. Consistently, overexpression of Ctnnd2 enhances the subcutaneous tumorigenesis and distant metastasis of Lewis lung cells in vivo. However, δ-catenin promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of Lewis lung cells. Mechanistically, δ-catenin enhances G1-S phase transition in cooperation with canonical Wnt signaling in Lewis lung cells. Moreover, δ-catenin promotes oncosphere formation of lung adenocarcinoma cells and is associated with the expression of cancer stem cell markers, which indicates δ-catenin enhances colonization and invasion via cancer stem cell maintenance. Taken together, our data suggest that δ-catenin may serve an important role in the malignancy of lung adenocarcinoma through activating canonical Wnt signaling and cancer stem cell maintenance.

MSMB synthesis is decreased in prostate tumors in relation to tumor grade. MSMB levels are also reduced in the circulation and MSMB is therefore used as a serum biomarker for prostate cancer. We hypothesized that cancers induce a reduction in MSMB synthesis also in the benign parts of the prostate, and that the magnitude of this response is related to tumor aggressiveness. Reduced levels of MSMB in the circulation could therefore be a consequence of reduced MSMB expression not only in tumor tissue but also in the benign prostate tissue.  Methods:   MSMB expression was analyzed in prostatectomy specimens from 36 patients using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. MSMB expression in the benign prostate tissue was analyzed in relation to Gleason score, tumor stage, and distance to the tumor. Furthermore, Dunning rat prostate tumors with different aggressiveness were implanted into the prostate of Copenhagen rats to study if this affected the MSMB expression in the tumor-adjacent benign rat prostate tissue.  Results:   In prostatectomy specimens, MSMB expression was reduced in prostate tumors but also in the tumor-adjacent benign parts of the prostate. The reduction in tumor MSMB was related to tumor grade and stage, and the reduction in the benign parts of the prostate to tumor grade, stage, and distance to the tumor. Implantation of Dunning cancer cells into the rat prostate resulted in reduced MSMB protein levels in the tumor-adjacent benign prostate tissue. Rapidly growing and metastatic MatLyLu tumors had a more pronounced effect than slow-growing non-metastatic G tumors.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that aggressive prostate tumors suppress MSMB synthesis in the benign prostate and that this could explain why serum levels of MSMB are decreased in prostate cancer patients.

Apatorsen is a second generation phosphorothioate antisense inhibitor of Hsp27 expression. We evaluated apatorsen in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Experimental design Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous apatorsen (3 loading doses of 600 mg within 5-9 days followed by weekly doses of 1000 mg) with oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily or prednisone alone. The primary endpoint was disease progression at 12 weeks. Crossover from prednisone alone was allowed after radiographic progression. Results 74 patients received apatorsen + prednisone (n = 36) or prednisone alone (n = 38). Twenty-five patients crossed-over to receive apatorsen + prednisone. Apatorsen treated patients received a median of 19 infusions. 50% of apatorsen + prednisone patients (95% CI: 32.9%, 67.1%) compared with 42% of prednisone patients (95% CI: 26.3%, 59.2%) did not have disease progression at week 12 (P = 0.33). A PSA decline of ≥50% was observed in 47% of apatorsen + prednisone and 24% of prednisone patients (P = 0.04), with a median duration of response of 24.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.0, 52) and 14.0 weeks (95% CI: 4.0, 44.4), respectively. A PSA decline of ≥50% was observed in 5 patients (20%) that received cross-over apatorsen. Infusion reactions were the most commonly reported adverse event occurring in 77% of apatorsen-treated patients.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficiency of chemotherapy in combination with RFH for the treatment of prostate cancer. The following four treatment groups were included: i) No treatment (control); ii) RFH-only; iii) chemotherapy (docetaxel)-only; and iv) combination therapy of docetaxel and RFH in human prostate cancer (HPC) cell lines and mice with HPC xenografts. In the in vitro experiments, a heating guidewire was attached under the bottom of the last chamber of the four-chamber cell culture slide, and was then connected to a radiofrequency (RF) generator. In the in vivo experiments, a tumor model was generated by subcutaneously injecting human prostate cancer cells into 24 male nu/nu mice. RFH was conducted by inserting the 0.022-inch heating-guidewire into the tumor. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a significant reduction in the average tumor size in animals treated with combination therapy compared with those receiving RFH-only and chemotherapy-only. The number of apoptotic cells and the average apoptotic index of the combination therapy group were significantly higher compared with those of the other three treatment groups. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that RFH is able to increase the therapeutic efficiency of docetaxel in prostate cancer, and this study serves as a foundation for the future development of an interventional molecular image-guided local treatment strategy for prostate cancer that integrates RF technology, interventional oncology and direct intratumoral chemotherapy, as a replacement for systemic chemotherapy.""","""['Xia Wu', 'Feng Zhang', 'Peng Hu', 'Lumin Chen', 'Guocan Han', 'Weixian Bai', 'Jingfeng Luo', 'Ran Chen', 'Yurong Zhou', 'Jihong Sun', 'Xiaoming Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Intratumoral radiofrequency hyperthermia-enhanced direct chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'Image-Guided Peri-Tumoral Radiofrequency Hyperthermia-Enhanced Direct Chemo-Destruction of Hepatic Tumor Margins.', 'Radiofrequency hyperthermia promotes the therapeutic effects on chemotherapeutic-resistant breast cancer when combined with heat shock protein promoter-controlled HSV-TK gene therapy: Toward imaging-guided interventional gene therapy.', 'Chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Docetaxel in the integrated management of prostate cancer.

However, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of AR-V7-driven transcription is limited. Here we report DBC1 as a key regulator of AR-V7 transcriptional activity and stability in CRPC cells. DBC1 functions as a coactivator for AR-V7 and is required for the expression of AR-V7 target genes including CDH2, a mesenchymal marker linked to CRPC progression. DBC1 is required for recruitment of AR-V7 to its target enhancers and for long-range chromatin looping between the CDH2 enhancer and promoter. Mechanistically, DBC1 enhances DNA-binding activity of AR-V7 by direct interaction and inhibits CHIP E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of AR-V7 by competing with CHIP for AR-V7 binding, thereby stabilizing and activating AR-V7. Importantly, DBC1 depletion suppresses the tumorigenic and metastatic properties of CRPC cells.

This study examined experience of care among cancer survivors and assessed associations of survivors' characteristics with their experience.  Materials and methods:   We used a newly-developed, unique data resource, SEER-CAHPS (NCI's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER] data linked to Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [CAHPS] survey responses), to examine experiences of care among breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors age >66years who completed CAHPS >1year after cancer diagnosis and survived ≥1year after survey completion. Experience of care was assessed by survivor-provided scores for overall care, health plan, physicians, customer service, doctor communication, and aspects of care. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations of survivors' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with care experience.  Results:   Among 19,455 cancer survivors with SEER-CAHPS data, higher self-reported general-health status was significantly associated with better care experiences for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors. In contrast, better mental-health status was associated with better care experience for lung cancer survivors. College-educated and Asian survivors were less likely to indicate high scores for care experiences. Few differences in survivors' experiences were observed by sex or years since diagnosis.  Conclusions:   The SEER-CAHPS data resources allows assessment of factors influencing experience of cancer among U.S. cancer survivors. Higher self-reported health status was associated with better experiences of care; other survivors' characteristics also predicted care experience.

Androgen signaling is a known and major driver for prostate cancer progression. Therefore, we analyzed major components of the androgen signaling chain and cell proliferation in relation to type 2 diabetes.  Methods:   Tumor content of 70 prostate tissue samples of men with type 2 diabetes and 59 samples of patients without diabetes was quantified by an experienced pathologist, and a subset of 51 samples was immunohistochemically stained for androgen receptor (AR). mRNA expression of AR, insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) and B (IR-B), IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), Cyp27A1 and Cyp7B1, PSA gene KLK3, PSMA gene FOLH1, Ki-67 gene MKI67, and estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) were analyzed by RT-qPCR.  Results:   AR mRNA and protein expression were associated with the tumor content only in men with diabetes. AR expression also correlated with downstream targets PSA (KLK3) and PSMA (FOLH1) and increased cell proliferation. Only in diabetes, AR expression was correlated to higher IR-A/IR-B ratio and lower IR-B/IGF1R ratio, thus, in favor of the mitogenic isoforms. Reduced Cyp27A1 and increased Cyp7B1 expressions in tumor suggest lower levels of protective estrogen receptor ligands in diabetes.  Conclusions:   We report elevated androgen receptor signaling and activity presumably due to altered insulin/IGF-1 receptors and decreased levels of protective estrogen receptor ligands in prostate cancer in men with diabetes. Our results reveal new insights why these patients have a worse prognosis. These findings provide the basis for future clinical trials to investigate treatment response in patients with prostate cancer and diabetes.""","""['Stefan Zoltán Lutz', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Marcus Oliver Scharpf', 'Corinna Sailer', 'Louise Fritsche', 'Vera Schmid', 'Konstantinos Kantartzis', 'Robert Wagner', 'Rainer Lehmann', 'Lucia Berti', 'Andreas Peter', 'Harald Staiger', 'Andreas Fritsche', 'Falko Fend', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Hans-Ulrich Häring', 'Martin Heni']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Metab""","""['Insulin signaling, androgen receptor and PSMA immunohistochemical analysis by semi-automated tissue microarray in prostate cancer with diabetes (DIAMOND study).', 'A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Comparative effects of DHEA vs. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol on proliferation and gene expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'A Problem in NIH and Federally Funded Prostate Cancer Interventional Clinical Trials.', 'Inceptor correlates with markers of prostate cancer progression and modulates insulin/IGF1 signaling and cancer cell migration.', 'Diabetes and the Prostate: Elevated Fasting Glucose, Insulin Resistance and Higher Levels of Adrenal Steroids in Prostate Cancer.', 'Very Low Prostate PET/CT PSMA Uptake May Be Misleading in Staging Radical Prostatectomy Candidates.', 'SRSF-1 and microvessel density immunohistochemical analysis by semi-automated tissue microarray in prostate cancer patients with diabetes (DIAMOND study).']"""

Methods and materials:   Men prospectively enrolled in an AS program between 1992 and 2014 and subsequently undergoing curative radiation therapy (ie, image guided radiation therapy [IGRT] or low-dose-rate brachytherapy [LDR-BT]) were identified. Biochemical relapse-free rate (bRFR), metastasis-free rate (mFR), and overall survival (OS) were compared against a cohort of men treated up front, matched by age, clinical prognostic indices (risk group, prostate-specific antigen, cT category, Gleason score, percentage of involved biopsy cores), and radiation therapy modality.  Results:   Of 1070 patients in the AS registry, 200 underwent definitive radiation therapy (143 IGRT and 57 LDR-BT) after a median of 32.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 20.6-59.8) months on surveillance. Main reasons for treatment were grade and volume upgrading (57.5% and 26%, respectively). Median follow-up after radiation therapy was 4.9 (IQR 3.1-7.5) years. At 5 years the bRFR, mFR, and OS were, respectively, 97%, 99%, and 98.5%. No patient died of prostate cancer. Adequate risk-matching was confirmed in an independent cohort comprising 359 patients receiving up-front IGRT (71%) or LDR-BT (29%) and followed for a median of 9 (IQR 3.1-7.5) years. There was no difference in the disease-specific outcomes (bRFR, mFR) between the 2 cohorts (Gray's P value of .257 and .934, respectively). In multivariate analyses, timing of radical radiation therapy (deferred vs up-front) was not correlated to biochemical relapse or metastases occurrence.  Conclusions:   Curative-intent radiation therapy (ie, dose-escalated IGRT or LDR-BT) after a period of AS renders excellent oncologic outcomes at 5 years.

The test quantifies a previously described 3.4 kb mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion.  Methods:   In a first prospective study of an MRI-guided re-biopsy population (n = 126), the 3.4 kb deletion and 18S rRNA gene were amplified from plasma. A diagnostic threshold was selected from the coordinates of the receiver operating characteristic curve and tested in a second population of men who were (n = 92) biopsy naïve when the mtDNA deletion was assayed and for whom those diagnosed with cancer on initial biopsy were treated with radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The 3.4 kb deletion was a good predictor of CS PCa in the image-guided re-biopsy population [AUC 0.84, (95% CI 0.73-0.95)] and the selected threshold corresponded to a sensitivity of 87% [95% CI, 70-96%], specificity of 68% [95% CI, 47-85%] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97%. Applying this threshold to the second population showed this deletion to be a strong predictor of CS cancer [AUC 0.98, (95% CI 0.94-1.02)], independent of PSA or age [sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 93-100%), specificity 90% (95%CI 73-98%) and NPV 100%].

In most of the studies on human immune cells, EVs have been isolated from cancer cell culture medium or patients' body fluids and added to the immune cell cultures. In such a setting, the physiological relevance of the chosen EV concentration is unknown and the EV isolation method and the timing of EV administration may bias the results. In the current study we aimed to develop an experimental cell culture model to study EV-mediated effects in human T and B cells at conditions mimicking the tumour microenvironment. We constructed a human prostate cancer cell line PC3 producing GFP-tagged EVs (PC3-CD63-GFP cells) and developed a 3D heterotypic spheroid model composed of PC3-CD63-GFP cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The transfer of GFP-tagged EVs from PC3-CD63-GFP cells to the lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging. The endocytic pathway was investigated using three endocytosis inhibitors. Our results showed that GFP-tagged EVs interacted with a large fraction of B cells, however, the majority of EVs were not internalised by B cells but rather remained bound at the cell surface. T cell subsets differed in their ability to interact with the EVs - 15.7-24.1% of the total CD3+ T cell population interacted with GFP-tagged EVs, while only 0.3-5.8% of CD8+ T were GFP positive. Furthermore, a fraction of EVs were internalised in CD3+ T cells via macropinocytosis.

Molecular iodine (I2) induces antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in prostate cancer cells, but it is unknown if I2 regulates oxidative stress in the normal and/or tumoral prostate. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of I2 and celecoxib (Cxb) on oxidative stress and inflammation in a model of prostatic hyperplasia. Cxb was used as positive control of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition. Prostatic hyperplasia was induced in male Wistar rats (170g) with testosterone (5mg/kg/week, for three weeks). One week before hyperplasia induction, I2 (25mg/day/rat) or Cxb (1.25mg/day/rat) was supplied for four weeks in the drinking water. Prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated by histological analysis, DNA content, and/or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Lipoperoxidation (malondialdehyde) and nitrite (NO2-) levels were analyzed by colorimetric methods, while nitric oxide synthase (NOS), COX, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymes were analyzed using RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and/or enzymatic assays. Levels of 15-F2t-isoprostanes, prostaglandins (PGE2), leukotrienes (LTB4), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were measured by ELISA. Control testosterone-treated animals exhibited hyperplasia in the dorsolateral prostate, as well as increments in almost all oxidative parameters except for COX-1, TNFα, or MPO. I2 and Cxb prevented epithelial hyperplasia (DNA content) and oxidative stress induction generated by testosterone in almost the same intensity, and the minimum I2 dose required was 2.5mg/rat. The antioxidant capacity of I2 was also analyzed in a cell-free system, showing that this element inhibited the conversion of nitrate (NO3-) to NO2-. I2 did not modify the prostatic oxidative state in testosterone untreated rats. In summary, our data showed that antiproliferative and antioxidant effects of I2 involve the inhibition of NOS and the COX-2 pathway. Further studies are necessary to analyze the therapeutic and/or adjuvant effects of I2 with first-line medications used to treat BPH.""","""['Michelle Quintero-García', 'Evangelina Delgado-González', 'Ana Sánchez-Tusie', 'Mario Vázquez', 'Carmen Aceves', 'Brenda Anguiano']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Inhibitory effects of Ponciri Fructus on testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'Amelioration of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia using febuxostat in rats: The role of VEGF/TGFβ and iNOS/COX-2.', 'The anti-hyperplasia, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of Qing Ye Dan and swertiamarin in testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.', 'The extrathyronine actions of iodine as antioxidant, apoptotic, and differentiation factor in various tissues.', 'Iodine Supplementation Improved Antioxidant Status, Hormonal Status, Sexual Behavior, and Semen Production Performance of Bos indicus Bulls Under Tropical Climatic Condition.', 'Relationship between Dietary Patterns with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Erectile Dysfunction: A Collaborative Review.', 'Periodontitis Exacerbates Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia through Regulation of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.', 'Low-dose cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib plays a protective role in the rat model of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.', 'Testosterone aggravates cerebral vascular injury by reducing plasma HDL levels.']"""

To examine Usp9x tumorigenicity and consequence of Usp9x inhibition in human pancreatic tumor models, we carried out gain- and loss-of-function studies using established human pancreatic tumor cell lines (PANC1 and MIAPACA2) and four spontaneously immortalized human pancreatic patient-derived tumor (PDX) cell lines. The effect of Usp9x activity inhibition by small molecule deubiquitinase inhibitor G9 was assessed in 2D and 3D culture, and its efficacy was tested in human tumor xenografts. Overexpression of Usp9x increased 3D growth and invasion in PANC1 cells and up-regulated the expression of known Usp9x substrates Mcl-1 and ITCH. Usp9x inhibition by shRNA-knockdown or by G9 treatment reduced 3D colony formation in PANC1 and PDX cell lines, induced rapid apoptosis in MIAPACA2 cells, and associated with reduced Mcl-1 and ITCH protein levels. Although G9 treatment reduced human MIAPACA2 tumor burden in vivo, in mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines established from constitutive (8041) and doxycycline-inducible (4668) KrasG12D/Tp53R172H mouse pancreatic tumors, Usp9x inhibition increased and sustained the 3D colony growth and showed no significant effect on tumor growth in 8041-xenografts.

We performed a proteomic comparative profiling of PCa tissue from radical prostatectomy (RPE) of patients without nodal metastases or relapse at the time of surgical resection (n=5) to PCa tissue from RPE of patients who suffered from nodal relapse (n=5). For the latter group, we also included patient-matched tissue of the nodal metastases. All samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. We identified and quantified more than 1200 proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with subsequent label-free quantification. An increase of ribosomal or proteasomal proteins in LNM (compared to corresponding PCa) became apparent, while extracellular matrix components rather decreased. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) corroborated accumulation of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 and N-myc-downstream-regulated-gene 3, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11, and protein phosphatase slingshot homolog 3 in LNM. These findings strengthen the present interest in examining PARP inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive PCa. IHC also corroborated increased abundance of retinol dehydrogenase 11 in metastasized primary PCa compared to organ-confined PCa. Generally, metastasizing primary tumors were characterized by an enrichment of proteins involved in cellular lipid metabolic processes with concomitant decrease of cell adhesion proteins.

As a sensing probe, Au NRs nanocomposite was assembled on the surface of the cathode and acted as both the quencher of the CdTe QDs ECL and the promoter of the luminol ECL. After incubated with PSA, the Au NRs nanocomposite was peeled off from the electrode surface due to the specific recognition between PSA and aptamer.

Material and methods:   We relied on 49,358 patients treated with RP and PLND (2010-2013) in SEER database. Adherence rates were quantified and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression analyses tested for independent predictors.  Results:   According to NCCN PLND guideline and D'Amico LNI classification, PLND was recommended in 63.3% and 64.9% of patients, respectively. Corresponding adherence rates were 68.8% and 69.1%. Adherence rates improved from 67.3% to 71.6% and from 67.6% to 72.0%, respectively, over time. In MVA, more advanced clinical stage, higher biopsy Gleason score and higher number of positive biopsy cores predicted PLNDs that were performed below NCCN LNI nomogram risk threshold. Conversely, lower clinical stage, lower PSA and lower biopsy Gleason score predicted PLND omission in individuals with risk level above NCCN LNI nomogram risk threshold. MVA results for D'Amico classification were virtually identical.  Conclusions:   Adherence to NCCN PLND guideline and D'Amico LNI classification for purpose of PLND is suboptimal in SEER population-based patients treated with RP.

Patients were asymptomatic, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and did not have high-risk lesions for tumour flare (eg, >5 sites of visceral disease or bone lesions with impending fracture). For the cohort reported here, we required patients to have had progression on enzalutamide with a continued prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise after enzalutamide treatment discontinuation. Patients received BAT, which consisted of intramuscular testosterone cipionate 400 mg every 28 days until progression and continued luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy. Upon progression after BAT, men were rechallenged with oral enzalutamide 160 mg daily. The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed 50% decline in PSA concentration from baseline (PSA50) for BAT (for all patients who received at least one dose) and for enzalutamide rechallenge (based on intention-to-treat analysis). These data represent the final analysis for the post-enzalutamide cohort, while two additional cohorts (post-abiraterone and newly castration-resistant prostate cancer) are ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02090114.  Findings:   Between Aug 28, 2014, and May 18, 2016, we accrued 30 eligible patients and treated them with BAT. Nine (30%; 95% CI 15-49; p<0·0001) of 30 patients achieved a PSA50 to BAT. 29 patients completed BAT and 21 proceeded to enzalutamide rechallenge, of whom 15 (52%; 95% CI 33-71; p<0·0001) achieved a PSA50 response. During BAT, the only grade 3-4 adverse event occurring in more than one patient was hypertension (three [10%] patients). Other grade 3 or worse adverse events occurring during BAT in one [3%] patient each were pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, urinary obstruction, gallstone, and sepsis. During enzalutamide retreatment, no grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in more than one patient. No treatment-related deaths were reported during either BAT or enzalutamide retreatment.  Interpretation:   BAT is a safe therapy that resulted in responses in asymptomatic men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and also resensitisation to enzalutamide in most patients undergoing rechallenge. Further studies with BAT are needed to define the potential clinical role for BAT in the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and the optimal strategy for sequencing between androgen and antiandrogen therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer to maximise therapeutic benefit to patients.

Clinical candidates are N-substituted derivatives of the dual LSD1-/monoamine oxidase-inhibitor tranylcypromine (2-PCPA) with a basic amine function in the N-substituent. These derivatives are selective over monoamine oxidases. So far, only very limited information on structure-activity studies about this important class of LSD1 inhibitors is published in peer reviewed journals. Here, we show that N-substituted 2-PCPA derivatives without a basic function or even a polar group are still potent inhibitors of LSD1 in vitro and effectively inhibit colony formation of leukemic cells in culture. Yet, these lipophilic inhibitors also block the structurally related monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B), which may be of interest for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, but this property is undesired for applications in cancer treatment. The introduction of a polar, non-basic function led to optimized structures that retain potent LSD1 inhibitors but exhibit selectivity over MAOs and are highly potent in the suppression of colony formation of cultured leukemic cells.

Activated ANXA7 GTPase promotes prostate cancer cell apoptosis. However, the role and underlying mechanism of ANXA7 GTPase in prostate cancer metastasis have not been established. RKIP is a metastatic suppressor and downregulated in prostate cancer metastases. The binding of RKIP and its target proteins could inhibit the activation of its interactive partners. However, the effect of RKIP on ANXA7 GTPase activation is not clear. Here, we report that activation of ANXA7 GTPase by a small molecule SEC ((S)-ethyl 1-(3-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)-3- (4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate) effectively inhibited prostate cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, activated ANXA7 promoted AMPK phosphorylation, leading to decreased mTORC1 activity, suppressed STAT3 nuclear translocation, and downregulation of pro-metastatic genes, including CCL2, APLN, and IL6ST. Conversely, RKIP interacted with ANXA7 and impaired activation of ANXA7 GTPase by SEC and its downstream signaling pathway. Notably, SEC treatment suppressed metastasis of prostate cancer cells in in vivo orthotopic analysis. Together, our findings provide a novel insight into how metastasis of prostate cancer with low RKIP expression is suppressed by SEC-induced activation of ANXA7 GTPase via the AMPK/mTORC1/STAT3 signaling pathway.""","""['ShuYan Liu', 'Xiao Li', 'ZhaoMin Lin', 'Le Su', 'Shan Yan', 'BaoXiang Zhao', 'JunYing Miao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Reduction of RKIP expression promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma invasion and metastasis by activating Stat3 signaling.', 'ANXA7-GTPase as Tumor Suppressor: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Annexin-A7 protects normal prostate cells and induces distinct patterns of RB-associated cytotoxicity in androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor suppressor RKIP inhibits prostate cancer cell metastasis and sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment.', 'Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Identification of a new way to induce differentiation of dermal fibroblasts into vascular endothelial cells.', 'Activation of GRP78 ATPase suppresses A549 lung cancer cell migration by promoting ITGB4 degradation.', 'Insights of RKIP-Derived Suppression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Upregulation of GTPBP4 Promotes the Proliferation of Liver Cancer Cells.']"""

Some molecules that constitute these EVs have already been used as targets for detection of specific tumors. However, to the best of our knowledge, EVs from biopsies and plasma have not yet been compared nor thoroughly investigated as triggers of malignant transformation and metastatic niche formation. To evaluate the role of EVs in the cellular microenvironment, we have treated the normal epithelial prostate cell lines, RWPE-1 and PNT-2, with a pool of EVs from biopsies of prostate primary tumors (bEVs), biopsies of benign prostate hyperplasia (hEVs), plasma of prostate cancer (PCa) patients (pEVs) or plasma of healthy individuals (pnEVs). Each of the four pools consisted of isolated EVs from several subjects, of which PCa patients were in different stages of cancer. Migration and proliferation profiles, cytokine release, and a panel of PCa-associated genes' expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the cell lines were evaluated after 24 h incubation with EVs. When compared to the control groups, cells treated with the pool of EVs isolated from tumor biopsies and plasma of PCa patients showed greater migration and proliferation, significant alterations in gene expression, and high levels of IL-8, factors that are associated with cancer development. Specifically, isolated bEVs and pEVs may induce malignant features in non-tumor cells by activating several cellular events associated with cancer progression, suggesting that future PCa therapy may target multiple elements found in tumor-derived EVs.""","""['Aline G Souza', 'Isaura Beatriz B Silva', 'Esther Campos-Fernández', 'Karina Marangoni', 'Victor A F Bastos', 'Patrícia T Alves', 'Luiz R Goulart', 'Vivian Alonso-Goulart']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Extracellular Vesicles from Metastatic Rat Prostate Tumors Prime the Normal Prostate Tissue to Facilitate Tumor Growth.', 'Differential expression of epithelial and mesenchymal proteins in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Cell Stress Induced Stressome Release Including Damaged Membrane Vesicles and Extracellular HSP90 by Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The key role of extracellular vesicles in the metastatic process.', 'Role of epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Contribution of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles to Malignant Transformation of Normal Cells.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Interleukins: Novel Frontiers in Diagnostic and Therapeutic for Cancer.', 'Impact of native and external factors on exosome release: understanding reactive exosome secretion and its biogenesis.', 'Emerging Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Role of Exosomes in Liquid Biopsy for Monitoring Prostate Cancer Invasion and Metastasis.']"""

The aim of this study is to present data on inclusion and follow-up for AS in this unique global AS database.  Patients and methods:   Between 2014 and 2016, the database was created by combining patient data from 25 established AS cohorts worldwide (USA, Canada, Australasia, UK and Europe). Data on a total of 15 101 patients were included. Descriptive statistics were used to report patients' clinical and demographic characteristics at the time of PCa diagnosis, clinical follow-up, discontinuation of AS and subsequent treatment. Cumulative incidence curves were used to report discontinuation rates over time.  Results:   At diagnosis, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) patient age was 65 (60-70) years and the median prostate-specific antigen level was 5.4 (4.0-7.3) ng/mL. Most patients had clinical stage T1 disease (71.8%), a biopsy Gleason score of 6 (88.8%) and one tumour-positive biopsy core (60.3%). Patients on AS had a median follow-up time of 2.2 (1.0-5.0) years. After 5, 10 and 15 years of follow-up, respectively, 58%, 39% and 23% of patients were still on AS. The current version of GAP3 has limited data on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quality of life and genomic testing.  Conclusions:   GAP3 is the largest worldwide collaboration integrating patient data from men with PCa on AS. The results will allow individual patients and clinicians to have greater confidence in the personalized decision to either delay or proceed with active treatment. Longer follow-up and the evaluation of MRI, new genomic markers and patient-related outcomes will result in even more valuable data and eventually in better patient outcomes.""","""['Sophie M Bruinsma', 'Liying Zhang', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Daan Nieboer', ""Mieke Van Hemelrijck;Movember Foundation's Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance (GAP) consortium""]""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Reasons for Discontinuing Active Surveillance: Assessment of 21 Centres in 12 Countries in the Movember GAP3 Consortium.', 'Consistent Biopsy Quality and Gleason Grading Within the Global Active Surveillance Global Action Plan 3 Initiative: A Prerequisite for Future Studies.', ""Adherence to Active Surveillance Protocols for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Results of the Movember Foundation's Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Initiative."", 'MRI and surveillance.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Variations in the Uptake of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer and Its Impact on Outcomes.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'Risk of progression following a negative biopsy in prostate cancer active surveillance.', 'Comparison of outcomes of different biopsy schedules among men on active surveillance for prostate cancer: An analysis of the G.A.P.3 global consortium database.']"""

At 1, 2, and 3 years after RP, 6,107 (87.9%), 4,825 (90.9%), and 3,696 (91.6%) patients achieved continence. Number of Bx session had no influence on UI at follow up.

Generally, men with better Mediterranean diet scores (altMED) had lower odds of CRA, but black and Asian men had even lower odds of prevalent CRA with better altMED diet scores than did white men with higher altMED diet scores. In this study population, all men had lower odds of prevalent CRA, but black and Asian men, who had higher (more favorable) altMED diet scores than whites, had even lower odds of prevalent CRA compared with white men.

Methods:   Two-hundred ninety-two patients who previously underwent radical prostatectomy were retrospectively selected for a case-control study, excluding those with anastomotic strictures and significant perioperative complications and re-called for a medical follow-up visit after their consent to participate the study. They were divided in 3 different groups according to the surgical technique previously received: radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) combined with bladder neck preservation (BNP), RARP with bladder neck resection, and RARP combined with BNP and posterior musculofascial reconstruction (PRec). Functional and oncologic outcomes evaluation were integrated by a questionnaire on urinary continence status, abdominal ultrasound scan, uroflowmetry and post-void urine volume measurement. Urinary continence definition included the terms ""no pad"" or ""safety pad"".  Results:   Two hundred thirty-two patients responded to the phone call interview and were enrolled in the study. They presented comparable age, prostate volume and BMI. Differences in comorbidities, ASA score and medications, did not influence the postoperative functional results, focused on continence outcome. Early urinary continence was achieved in 49.38% and 24.73% of patients who previously underwent RARP + BNP + PRec and simple RARP respectively (p = 0.000)as well as late 12-months urinary continence was obtained in 92.59% and 79.56% of patients.(p = 0.01). Late urinary continence in the RRP + BNP group was comparable to the result obtained in the simple RARP group. The potential effects of nerve sparing technique on urinary continence have not been evaluated.

In human prostate cancer tissues, the ARSB activity was reduced and the GALNS activity was increased, compared to normal prostate tissue. In human prostate stem cells, when ARSB was reduced by silencing or GALNS was increased by overexpression, activity of SHP2, the ubiquitous non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, declined, attributable to increased binding of SHP2 with C4S. This led to increases in phospho-ERK1/2, Myc/Max nuclear DNA binding, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and expression, and methylation of the Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (DKK)3 promoter and to reduced DKK3 expression. Since DKK3 negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, silencing of ARSB or overexpression of GALNS disinhibited (increased) Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Docetaxel re-challenge has never been tested in a prospective randomised controlled study. As some studies support the addition of carboplatin to docetaxel, we performed a phase II trial investigating the combination of docetaxel plus carboplatin versus docetaxel re-treatment in docetaxel pre-treated mCRPC patients.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC with a progression-free interval of ≥3 months after initial docetaxel treatment were randomised between docetaxel 75 mg/m2 or docetaxel 60 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC4. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS; PSA/RECIST).  Results:   Owing to insufficient recruitment, the study was discontinued early after inclusion of 75 patients (targeted 150) PFS and overall survival (OS) were comparable between both groups (median PFS 12.7 months (95% CI 9.9-17.5 months) with docetaxel monotherapy and 11.7 months (95% CI 8.5-21.0 months) with combination therapy (p = 0.98); OS 18.5 months (95% CI 11.8-24.5 months) versus 18.9 months (95% CI 16.0-23.7 months) (p = 0.79). An interim analysis (SEQTEST) showed that the null hypothesis could already be excepted, and no significant difference between both study arms was expected if inclusion would be completed. The incidence of grade 3-4 infections and gastrointestinal side-effects was numerical higher in the carboplatin arm (p = 0.056).  Conclusion:   This early terminated study suggests no benefit from the addition of carboplatin to docetaxel re-treatment in patients with mCRPC, whereas the combination resulted in more toxicity.

We introduce a computational framework, ProTIE, to integratively analyze all three types of omics data for a complete molecular profile of a tissue sample. Our framework features MiStrVar, a novel algorithmic method to identify micro structural variants (microSVs) on genomic HTS data. Coupled with deFuse, a popular gene fusion detection method we developed earlier, MiStrVar can accurately profile structurally aberrant transcripts in tumors. Given the breakpoints obtained by MiStrVar and deFuse, our framework can then identify all relevant peptides that span the breakpoint junctions and match them with unique proteomic signatures. Observing structural aberrations in all three types of omics data validates their presence in the tumor samples.  Results:   We have applied our framework to all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and/or RNA-Seq datasets, spanning all four major subtypes, for which proteomics data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) have been released. A recent study on this dataset focusing on SNVs has reported many that lead to novel peptides. Complementing and significantly broadening this study, we detected 244 novel peptides from 432 candidate genomic or transcriptomic sequence aberrations. Many of the fusions and microSVs we discovered have not been reported in the literature. Interestingly, the vast majority of these translated aberrations, fusions in particular, were private, demonstrating the extensive inter-genomic heterogeneity present in breast cancer. Many of these aberrations also have matching out-of-frame downstream peptides, potentially indicating novel protein sequence and structure.

To date, there has been no evidence linking androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the association between ADT and RA in patients with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We identified 105 303 men age 66 years or older who were diagnosed with stages I-III prostate cancer from 1992 through 2006 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, excluding patients with a history of RA. χ2 test was used to compare 5-year Kaplan-Meier rates of RA diagnoses. Competing risk Cox regression using inverse probability of treatment weighting was utilized to examine the association between pharmacologic ADT and diagnosis of RA.  Results:   The 43% of patients (N = 44 785) who received ADT experienced a higher 5-year rate of RA diagnoses compared with men who did not (5.4% versus 4.4%, P < 0.001). Receipt of any ADT was associated with a 23% increased risk of being diagnosed with RA (hazard ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.40, P = 0.001). The risk of being diagnosed with RA increased with a longer duration of ADT, from 19% with 1-6 months and 29% with 7-12 months to 33% with ≥13 months (Ptrend < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Consistent with the immunosuppressive properties of androgens, we demonstrated for the first time that ADT was associated with an elevated risk of being diagnosed with RA in this large cohort of elderly men with prostate cancer. The risk was higher with a longer duration of ADT. Linking ADT to an increased risk of being diagnosed with an autoimmune condition adds to mounting evidence of the adverse effects of ADT that should prompt physicians to thoughtfully weigh its risks and benefits.""","""['D D Yang', 'A Krasnova', 'K T Nead', 'T K Choueiri', 'J C Hu', 'K E Hoffman', 'J B Yu', 'D E Spratt', 'F Y Feng', 'Q-D Trinh', 'P L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""[""Reply to the letter to the editor 'Androgen deprivation therapy and risk of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with localized prostate cancer' by Yang et al."", ""'Reply to the letter to the editor 'Androgen deprivation therapy and risk of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with localized prostate cancer' by Yang et al.' by V.

For each patient, three prostate tissue specimens varying in size and location were collected. Correlations were calculated between a) tissue specimens by size ( ≤ 20 mg, > 20 mg); b) individual tissue samples [Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)]; and c) plasma and mean tissue PLFA concentrations. PLFA concentrations from ≤ 20 mg and > 20 mg tissues were nearly identical. For most PLFAs, intra-individual correlations between tissue specimens were moderate to strong (linoleic acid = 0.66, eicosapentaenoic acid = 0.96), with only one ICC below 0.50 (trans-fatty acid 18:2, ICC = 0.28). Most correlations of mean tissue and plasma concentrations were moderate to strong (α-linoleic acid = 0.47, eicosapentaenoic acid = 0.93). PLFA concentrations are largely homogeneous within the prostate and can be reliably measured in small quantities of tissue.

Through the introgression of novel alleles of the Myb28 transcription factor from Brassica villosa, broccoli genotypes have been developed that have enhanced levels of glucoraphanin. This study seeks to quantify the exposure of human tissues to glucoraphanin and sulforaphane following consumption of broccoli with contrasting Myb28 genotypes.  Methods and results:   Ten participants are recruited into a three-phase, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial (NCT02300324), with each phase comprising consumption of 300 g of a soup made from broccoli of one of three Myb28 genotypes (Myb28B/B , Myb28B/V , Myb28V/V ). Plant myrosinases are intentionally denatured during soup manufacture. Threefold and fivefold higher levels of sulforaphane occur in the circulation following consumption of Myb28V/B and Myb28V/V broccoli soups, respectively.

Combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DCE MRI from 16 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and no previous treatment were acquired with a 3.0-T MRI scanner prior to radical prostatectomy, and used to identify dominant tumors. MRI results were validated by whole-mount histology. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon test, logistic generalized linear mixed effect models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used for the estimation of the statistical significance of the results. In the peripheral zone (PZ), the areas under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) were 0.98 (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 98%) for DTI, 0.96 (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 97%) for DCE and 0.99 (sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 98%) for DTI + DCE. In the entire prostate, the ROC-AUC values were 0.96 (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 95%) for DTI, 0.87 (sensitivity, 45%; specificity, 94%) for DCE and 0.96 (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 98%) for DTI + DCE. The increase in ROC-AUC by the addition of DCE was not statistically significant in either PZ or the entire prostate. The results of this study have shown that DTI identified dominant tumors with high accuracy in both PZ and the entire prostate, whereas the inclusion of DCE MRI had no significant impact on the identification of either PZ or entire prostate dominant lesions.

PC3-educated MSCs showed a reduced migration and proliferation capacity that was dependent on exposure to PC3-conditioned medium. Vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression was decreased in PC3-educated MSCs compared to untreated MSCs. PC3 and DU145 education of healthy donor and prostate cancer patient-derived MSCs led to a reduced proportion of FAP+ αSMA+ cells contrary to characteristics commonly associated with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The migration of PC3 cells was increased toward both PC3-educated and DU145-educated MSCs compared to untreated MSCs, while DU145 migration was only enhanced toward patient-derived MSCs.

Many patients respond to these agents, but both de novo and acquired resistance are common. The authors characterized resistant phenotypes that emerge after treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Methods:   Patients who received abiraterone or enzalutamide in the course of routine clinical care were consented for serial blood collection. A proprietary system (CellSearch) was used to enumerate and enrich circulating tumor cells (CTCs). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on pools of up to 10 epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive/CD45-negative CTCs. The impact of gene expression changes observed in CTCs between patients who responded or were resistant to abiraterone/enzalutamide therapies was further explored in a model cell line system.  Results:   RNA-seq data from CTCs identified mutations commonly associated with CRPC as well as novel mutations, including several in the ligand-binding domain of AR that could facilitate escape from AR-targeted agents. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially regulated genes identified the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) signaling pathways as significantly upregulated in drug-resistant CTCs. Transfection experiments using enzalutamide-sensitive and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells confirmed the involvement of SMAD family member 3, a key mediator of the TGFβ pathway, and of CCND1 in resistance to enzalutamide treatment.  Conclusions:   The current results indicate that RNA-seq of CTCs representing abiraterone and enzalutamide sensitive and resistant states can identify potential mechanisms of resistance. Therapies targeting the downstream signaling mediated by SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) and CCND1, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4/cyclin-dependent kinase 6 inhibitors, could provide new therapeutic options for the treatment of antiandrogen-resistant disease.

Whether this is true and how to define the best treatment approach at the time of first prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure to the authors' knowledge has not been elucidated to date and was studied herein.  Methods:   Between 1995 and 2001, a total of 58 men with unfavorable-risk PC who were treated on clinical trials with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) had available testosterone levels at the time of PSA failure. Cox and Fine and Gray regressions were performed to ascertain whether low versus normal testosterone was associated with the risk of PC-specific mortality, other-cause mortality, and all-cause mortality adjusting for age, salvage ADT, and known PC prognostic factors.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 6.68 years after PSA failure, 31 men (53.4%) had died; 10 of PC (32.3%), of which 8 of 11 (72.7%) versus 2 of 47 (4.3%) deaths occurred in men with low versus normal testosterone at the time of PSA failure, respectively. A significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.54; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-6.21 [P = .04]) and PC-specific mortality (AHR, 13.71; 95% CI, 2.4-78.16 [P = .003]), with a reciprocal trend toward a decreased risk of other-cause mortality (AHR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.02-1.55 [P = .12]) was observed in men with low versus normal testosterone.  Conclusions:   Low, but not necessarily castrate, testosterone levels at the time of PSA failure confer a very poor prognosis. These observations provide evidence to support testosterone testing at the time of PSA failure. Given prolonged survival when abiraterone or docetaxel is added to ADT in men with castrate-sensitive metastatic PC and possibly localized high-risk PC provides a rationale supporting their use with ADT in men with low testosterone in the setting of a phase 2 trial.

Despite the increased incidence of PNS, these patients are often times a clinical conundrum-to diagnose and to treat. Building on previous results in modeling glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we present a mathematical model for predicting the course and extent of the PNS of recurrent tumors.  Methods:   We created three-dimensional models of perineurally spreading tumor along the lumbosacral plexus from consecutive magnetic resonance imaging scans of two patients (one each with prostate cancer and cervical cancer). We adapted and applied a previously reported mathematical model of GBM to progression of tumor growth along the nerves on an anatomical model obtained from a healthy subject.  Results:   We were able to successfully model and visualize perineurally spreading pelvic cancer in two patients; average growth rates were 60.7 mm/year for subject 1 and 129 mm/year for subject 2. The model correlated well with extent of PNS on MRI scans at given time points.  Conclusions:   This is the first attempt to model perineural tumor spread and we believe that it provides a glimpse into the future of disease progression monitoring. Every tumor and every patient are different, and the possibility to report treatment response using a unified scale-as ""days gained""-will be a necessity in the era of individualized medicine.

We previously introduced two synthetic halogenated flavanone derivatives, 3',7-dichloroflavanone (3'-7 DCF) and 3',6-dichloroflavanone (3'-6 DCF), as potential apoptosis-inducing agents. In the current study, we investigated the ability of these compounds in triggering intrinsic or/and extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in breast and prostate cancer cells. Also, the synergistic effect of 3'-7 DCF with TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) agonist in apoptosis induction was evaluated on PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The involved pathway of apoptosis in the treated cells was delineated by caspase-3 activity assay, PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1) cleavage, and procaspase-9 cleavage as markers of the intrinsic pathway and procaspase-8 cleavage as the marker of the extrinsic pathway. With the exception of the normal cells, treatment of all cell lines with both 3'-7 DCF and 3'-6 DCF triggered the cleavage of procaspase-8 and procaspase-9. These results indicate that the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways of apoptosis are the mechanisms of the toxicity of flavanones in these cancer cell lines. However, the cytoxicity of the compound 3'-7 DCF was not synergistic with TLR3 agonist.

LASS2/TMSG1 gene was a novel tumor metastasis suppressor gene cloned from human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M in 1999 by our laboratory. It was found out that protein encoded by LASS2/TMSG1 could interact with the c subunit of V-ATPase (ATP6V0C). In this study, To use RNA interference to suppress the expression of ATP6V0C and try to further investigate the molecular mechanism of ATP6V0C in tumor metastasis and its relationship with LASS2/TMSG1 gene.  Methods and results:   The expression level of ATP6V0C mRNA and protein in high metastatic potential prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3M-1E8 and PC-3M) was significantly higher than that in low metastatic potential prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3M-2B4 and PC-3), the expression level in PC-3M-1E8 being the highest. Follow-up tests selected PC-3M-1E8 cells for gene silencing. The expression and secretion of MMP-2 and the expression of MMP-9 in ATP6V0C siRNA transfected PC-3M-1E8 cells displayed no obvious change, but the activity of secreted MMP-9 was abated noticeably compared with the controls (P<0.05). Extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and V-ATPase activity in interference group were both reduced significantly compared with the controls (P<0.05). The migration and invasion capacity of ATP6V0C siRNA interfered cells in vitro were diminished significantly compared with the controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, a dramatic reduction of LASS2/TMSG1 mRNA and protein level after transfection of siRNA in PC-3M-1E8 cells was discovered (P<0.05). Confocal immunofluorescence showed a vast co-localization of ATP6V0C protein and LASS2/TMSG1 protein in plasma and membrane. The co-localization signals of control group were much stronger than those of interference group.

We previously conducted three neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) trials prior to RP in unfavorable intermediate and high-risk disease.  Methods:   In this analysis, we report on the post-RP outcomes of a subset of patients enrolled on these studies. We conducted a pooled analysis of patients with available follow-up data treated on three neoadjuvant trials at three institutions. All patients received intense ADT prior to RP. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR was defined as a PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or treatment with radiation or androgen-deprivation therapy for a rising PSA < 0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Overall, 72 patients were included of whom the majority had a Gleason score ≥ 8 (n = 46, 63.9%). Following neoadjuvant therapy, 55.7% of patients (n = 39/70) had pT3 disease, 40% (n = 28) had seminal vesicle invasion, 12.9% (n = 9) had positive margins, and 11.4% (n = 8) had lymph node involvement. Overall, 11 (15.7%) had tumor measuring ≤ 0.5 cm, which included four patients (5.7%) with a pathologic complete response and seven (10.0%) with residual tumor measuring 0.1-0.5 cm. Compared to pretreatment clinical staging, 10 patients (14.3%) had pathologic T downstaging at RP. The median follow-up was 3.4 years. Overall, the 3-year BCR-free rate was 70% (95% CI 57%, 90%). Of the 15 patients with either residual tumor ≤ 0.5 cm or pathologic T downstaging, no patient experienced a recurrence.  Conclusion:   In this exploratory pooled clinical trials analysis, we highlight that neoadjuvant therapy prior to RP in unfavorable intermediate and high-risk patients may potentially have a positive impact on recurrence rates.

In 1987 to 1989, ARIC recruited 15,792 participants 45 to 64 years old to be sex (55% female), race (27% black), and geographically diverse. ARIC has exceptional data collected during 6 clinical visits and calls every 6 months, repeated biospecimens, and linkage to Medicare claims data.Methods: We established a Cancer Coordinating Center to implement infrastructure activities, convened a Working Group for data use, leveraged ARIC staff and procedures, and developed protocols. We initiated a cancer-specific participant contact, added questions to existing contacts, obtained permission to collect medical records and tissue, abstracted records, linked with state cancer registries, and adjudicated cases and characterizing data.Results: Through 2012, we ascertained and characterized 4,743 incident invasive, first, and subsequent primary cancers among 4,107 participants and 1,660 cancer-related deaths. We generated a total cancer incidence and mortality analytic case file, and analytic case files for bladder, breast, colorectal, liver, lung, pancreas, and prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and case fatality. Adjudication of multiple data sources improved case records and identified cancers not identified via registries. From 2013 onward, we ascertain cases from self-report coupled with medical records. Additional cancer registry linkages are planned.Conclusions: Compared with starting a new cohort, expanding a cardiovascular cohort into ARIC Cancer was an efficient strategy. Our efforts yielded enhanced case files with 25 years of follow-up.Impact: Now that the cancer infrastructure is established, ARIC is contributing its unique features to modern cancer epidemiology research.

However, the superiority of TR with respect to urinary continence recovery following RP remains controversial. This study identified the effect of TR versus nonTR of the pelvic floor on short-term and long-term continence rates after RP.  Methods:   A literature search was performed in November 2017 using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Only comparative research or clinical studies reporting urinary continence outcomes was included in the meta-analysis, and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the 2011 Level of Evidence for therapy research.  Results:   We analyzed ten studies reporting urinary continence rates after RP at one or more postoperative time points (1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks).

Acetylation of histone H3K18, associated with gene activation, is enhanced by P300 and opposed by the deacetylase Sirtuin2 (SIRT2). As these enzymes represent an important target for cancer therapy, we sought to determine whether the underlying genes are altered during prostate cancer (PCa) progression.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays generated from 71 radical prostatectomy patients were initially immunostained for H3K18Ac, P300 and SIRT2. Protein levels were quantified using VECTRA automation and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA, n = 499) and Gene Expression Omnibus (n = 504) databases were queried for expression, genomic and clinical data. Statistics were performed using SPSSv23.  Results:   Nuclear histone H3K18Ac staining increases in primary cancer (p = 0.05) and further in metastases (p < 0.01) compared to benign on tissue arrays. P300 protein expression increases in cancer (p = 0.04) and metastases (p < 0.001). A progressive decrease in nuclear SIRT2 staining occurs comparing benign to cancer or metastases (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 respectively). Decreased SIRT2 correlates with higher grade cancer (p = 0.02). Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence is shorter in patients exhibiting high compared to low H3K18Ac expression (350 vs. 1542 days respectively, P = 0.03). In GEO, SIRT2 mRNA levels are lower in primary and metastatic tumors (p = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). TGCA analysis demonstrates SIRT2 deletion in 6% and increasing clinical stage, positive margins and lower PSA recurrence-free survival in patients with SIRT2 loss/deletion (p = 0.01, 0.04 and 0.04 respectively). In this dataset, a correlation between decreasing SIRT2 and increasing P300 mRNA expression occurs in tumor samples (R = -0.46).  Conclusions:   In multiple datasets, decreases in SIRT2 expression portend worse clinicopathologic outcomes. Alterations in SIRT2-H3K18Ac suggest altered P300 activity and identify a subset of tumors that could benefit from histone deacetylation inhibition.""","""['Shivashankar Damodaran', 'Nathan Damaschke', 'Joseph Gawdzik', 'Bing Yang', 'Cedric Shi', 'Glenn O Allen', 'Wei Huang', 'John Denu', 'David Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Identifying Dysregulated Epigenetic Enzyme Activity in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Development.', 'High glucose-induced oxidative stress represses sirtuin deacetylase expression and increases histone acetylation leading to neural tube defects.', 'A role for SIRT2-dependent histone H3K18 deacetylation in bacterial infection.', 'H3K18Ac as a Marker of Cancer Progression and Potential Target of Anti-Cancer Therapy.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of Chromatin in Prostate Cancer.', 'In silico drug discovery of SIRT2 inhibitors from natural source as anticancer agents.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Distinct histone H3 modification profiles correlate with aggressive characteristics of salivary gland neoplasms.', 'Multiplex Tissue Imaging: Spatial Revelations in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Role of sirtuins in esophageal cancer: Current status and future prospects.']"""

The impact of folate exposure and intervention timing on cancer progression remains controversial. Due to polyamine metabolism's extraordinary biosynthetic flux in prostate cancer (CaP) we demonstrated androgen stimulated CaP is susceptible to dietary folate deficiency. We hypothesized dietary folate levels may also affect castration recurrent CaP. We used the CWR22 human xenograft model which recurs following androgen withdrawal. Engrafted mice were fed a folate depleted or supplemented diet beginning at androgen withdrawal, or prior to xenograft implantation. Both folate depletion and supplementation at the time of withdrawal significantly decreased recurrence incidence. Folate supplementation prior to xenograft implantation increased time to recurrence, suggesting a protective role. By contrast, folate depleted recurrent tumors exhibited transcriptional adaptive responses that maintained high polyamine levels at the expense of increased DNA damage and DNA methylation alterations. Mining of publically available data demonstrated folate related pathways are exceptionally dysregulated in human CaP, which correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence.

Methods We performed a landmark survival analysis at 7 months using the E3805 Chemohormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) database ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00309985). Inclusion required at least 7 months of follow-up and PSA levels at 7 months from ADT initiation. We used the prognostic classifiers identified in a previously reported trial (Southwest Oncology Group 9346) of PSA ≤ 0.2, > 0.2 to 4, and > 4 ng/mL. Results Seven hundred nineteen of 790 patients were eligible for this subanalysis; 358 were treated with ADT plus docetaxel, and 361 were treated with ADT alone. Median follow-up time was 23.1 months. On multivariable analysis, achieving a 7-month PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL was more likely with docetaxel, low-volume disease, prior local therapy, and lower baseline PSAs (all P ≤ .01). Across all patients, median overall survival was significantly longer if 7-month PSA reached ≤ 0.2 ng/mL compared with > 4 ng/mL (median survival, 60.4 v 22.2 months, respectively; P < .001). On multivariable analysis, 7-month PSA ≤ 0.2 and low volume disease were prognostic of longer overall survival (all P < 0.01). The addition of docetaxel increased the likelihood of achieving a PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at 7 months (45.3% v 28.8% of patients on ADT alone). Patients on ADT alone who achieved a 7-month PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL had the best survival and were more likely to have low-volume disease (56.7%). Conclusion PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at 7 months is prognostic for longer overall survival with ADT for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer irrespective of docetaxel administration.

Furthermore, higher Gleason scores correlates with decreasing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) data from diffusion weighted MRI (DWI-MRI). Based on these observations, we present a formalism for dose painting prescriptions of prostate volumes based on ADC images mapped to Gleason score driven dose-responses.  Methods:   The Gleason score driven dose-responses were derived from a learning data set consisting of pre-RT biopsy data and post-RT outcomes for 122 patients treated with a homogeneous dose to the prostate. For a test data set of 18 prostate cancer patients with pre-RT ADC images, we mapped the ADC data to the Gleason driven dose-responses by using probability distributions constructed from published Gleason score correlations with ADC data. We used the Gleason driven dose-responses to optimize dose painting prescriptions that maximize the tumor control probability (TCP) with equal average dose as for the learning sets homogeneous treatment dose.  Results:   The dose painting prescriptions increased the estimated TCP compared to the homogeneous dose by 0-51% for the learning set and by 4-30% for the test set. The potential for individual TCP gains with dose painting correlated with increasing Gleason score spread and larger prostate volumes. The TCP gains were also found to be larger for patients with a low expected TCP for the homogeneous dose prescription.  Conclusions:   We have from retrospective treatment data demonstrated a formalism that yield ADC driven dose painting prescriptions for prostate volumes that potentially can yield significant TCP increases without increasing dose burdens as compared to a homogeneous treatment dose. This motivates further development of the approach to consider more accurate ADC to Gleason mappings, issues with delivery robustness of heterogeneous dose distributions, and patient selection criteria for design of clinical trials.""","""['Eric Grönlund', 'Silvia Johansson', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Camilla Thellenberg', 'Anders Ahnesjö']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Robust treatment planning of dose painting for prostate cancer based on ADC-to-Gleason score mappings - what is the potential to increase the tumor control probability?', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI of peripheral zone prostate cancer: comparison of tumor apparent diffusion coefficient with Gleason score and percentage of tumor on core biopsy.', 'Apparent diffusion coefficient value and ratio as noninvasive potential biomarkers to predict prostate cancer grading: comparison with prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The utility of quantitative ADC values for differentiating high-risk from low-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Isotoxic dose escalated radiotherapy for glioblastoma based on diffusion-weighted MRI and tumor control probability-an in-silico study.', 'Adaptive dose painting for prostate cancer.', 'The feasibility of a dose painting procedure to treat prostate cancer based on mpMR images and hierarchical clustering.', 'Role of MRI-Based Functional Imaging in Improving the Therapeutic Index of Radiotherapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'Robust dose-painting-by-numbers vs. nonselective dose escalation for non-small cell lung cancer patients.']"""

The rs9939609 polymorphism in the FTO gene has recently been implicated as a risk factor for some types of cancer, such as breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. FTO variation is associated with altered adipocytokine expression and oxidative stress inflammation, which may influence asbestos mediated-carcinogenesis. This is the first study to investigate a possible association between this polymorphism and MPM risk.  Materials and methods:   FTO rs9939609 (T >A) genotypes were screened using a TaqMan® Genotyping Assay in a total of 235 Egyptian subjects (86 MPM patients versus 149 controls). The chi-square test and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between the candidate variant and MPM risk using a case-control design.  Results:   In the additive genetic model, the AT and AA genotypes were associated with a 2.48-fold (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.04-5.92, p = 0.04) and a 3.46-fold (95% CI = 0.99-12.01, p = 0.051) increase in the odds of developing MPM, respectively, when compared to the TT genotype after adjustment for body mass index, age, and gender. Additionally, in the dominant genetic model AT/AA genotypes were associated with a 2.63-fold increase in the odds of developing MPM (95% CI = 1.13-6.12, p = 0.025).  Conclusions:   The present study shows for the first time that rs9939609 polymorphism in the FTO gene may be a genetic risk factor for MPM. This study highlights the association of this genetic polymorphism with cancer susceptibility, and therefore, it should be investigated in various other populations, in relation to different types of cancer, and with larger sample sizes.""","""['Mina S Khella', 'Ahmed M Salem', 'Omar Abdel-Rahman', 'Amr S Saad']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Genet Test Mol Biomarkers""","""['The (FTO) gene polymorphism is associated with metabolic syndrome risk in Egyptian females: a case- control study.', 'Fat mass and obesity-associated gene rs9939609 polymorphism is a potential biomarker of recurrent venous thromboembolism in male but not in female patients.', 'FTO gene polymorphisms (rs9939609 and rs17817449) as predictors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in obese Iraqi population.', 'Pathogenesis of malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'Genetic susceptibility to malignant pleural mesothelioma and other asbestos-associated diseases.', 'The effects of FTO gene rs9939609 polymorphism on the association between colorectal cancer and dietary intake.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'The Association of Fat-Mass-and Obesity-Associated Gene Polymorphism (rs9939609) With Colorectal Cancer: A Case-Control Study.', 'Significant epitranscriptomes in heterogeneous cancer.', 'Genetic polymorphisms in aquaporin 1 as risk factors for malignant mesothelioma and biomarkers of response to cisplatin treatment.']"""

A virtual patient geometry is created using contours from a real patient pelvis CT scan, where known elemental compositions and varying densities are overwritten in each voxel. A second phantom is made with additional calcifications. Both phantoms are the ground truth with which all results are compared. Simulated CT images are generated from them using attenuation coefficients taken from the XCOM database with a 100 kVp spectrum for SECT and 80 and 140Sn kVp for DECT. Tissue segmentation for Monte Carlo dose calculation is made using a stoichiometric calibration method for the simulated SECT images. For the DECT images, Bayesian eigentissue decomposition is used. A LDR prostate brachytherapy plan is defined with 125I sources and then calculated using the EGSnrc user-code Brachydose for each case. Dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVH) are compared to ground truth to assess the accuracy of tissue segmentation. For noiseless images, DECT-based tissue segmentation outperforms the SECT procedure with a root mean square error (RMS) on relative errors on dose distributions respectively of 2.39% versus 7.77%, and provides DVHs closest to the reference DVHs for all tissues. For a medium level of CT noise, Bayesian eigentissue decomposition still performs better on the overall dose calculation as the RMS error is found to be of 7.83% compared to 9.15% for SECT. Both methods give a similar DVH for the prostate while the DECT segmentation remains more accurate for organs at risk and in presence of calcifications, with less than 5% of RMS errors within the calcifications versus up to 154% for SECT. In a patient-like geometry, DECT-based tissue segmentation provides dose distributions with the highest accuracy and the least bias compared to SECT. When imaging noise is considered, benefits of DECT are noticeable if important calcifications are found within the prostate.""","""['Charlotte Remy', 'Arthur Lalonde', 'Dominic Béliveau-Nadeau', 'Jean-François Carrier', 'Hugo Bouchard']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Improved tissue assignment using dual-energy computed tomography in low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy for Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Simulation study on potential accuracy gains from dual energy CT tissue segmentation for low-energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations.', 'The impact of dual- and multi-energy CT on proton pencil beam range uncertainties: a Monte Carlo study.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Many new tests are being developed that will predict the presence of indicators of aggressive disease like early biochemical recurrence. Since recurrence occurs in less than 10% of patients treated for prostate cancer, validation of such tests will require expensive testing on large patient groups. Moreover, clinical application of the validated test requires that each new patient be tested. In this report we introduce a two-stage classifier system that minimizes the number of patients that must be tested in both the validation and clinical application of any new test for recurrence.  Materials and methods:   Expressed prostatic secretion specimens were prospectively collected from 450 patients prior to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Patients were followed for 2.5 years for evidence of biochemical recurrence. Standard clinical parameters, the levels proteolytic activity of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and the levels of PCA3 RNA, PSA RNA and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion RNA were determined in each prospective patient specimen for subsequent correlation with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   While levels of PCA3 and PSA proteolytic activity (PPA) in prostatic secretions provided an effective pre-surgical predictor of early biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer, application of the two-stage classifier shows that only 60% of the patients need these tests.  Conclusion:   Two-stage classifiers can provide a parsimonious approach to both the validation and clinical application of biomarker-based tests. Adoption of the two-stage neutral zone classifier can reduce unnecessary testing in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Daniel R Jeske', 'Jenifer A Linehan', 'Timothy G Wilson', 'Mark H Kawachi', 'Kristina Wittig', 'Katarzya Lamparska', 'Camille Amparo', 'Rosa Mejia', 'Fang Lai', 'Dimitra Georganopoulou', 'Steven S Smith']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Prognostic Significance of TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Gene in Prostate Cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Molecular diagnosis of prostate cancer: PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Data Mining and Expression Analysis of Differential lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'Detecting the Interdisciplinary Nature and Topic Hotspots of Robotics in Surgery: Social Network Analysis and Bibliometric Study.']"""

Therefore, targeting the molecular pathways that underlie dissemination of primary tumor cells and the formation of metastases has a great clinical value. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a critical role in tumor progression and this study focuses on the role of BMP9- Activin receptor-Like Kinase 1 and 2 (ALK1 and ALK2) axis in prostate cancer. In order to study the effect of BMP9 in vitro and in vivo on cancer cells and tumor growth, we used a soluble chimeric protein consisting of the ALK1 extracellular domain (ECD) fused to human Fc (ALK1Fc) that prevents binding of BMP9 to its cell surface receptors and thereby blocks its ability to activate downstream signaling. ALK1Fc sequesters BMP9 and the closely related BMP10 while preserving the activation of ALK1 and ALK2 through other ligands. We show that ALK1Fc acts in vitro to decrease BMP9-mediated signaling and proliferation of prostate cancer cells with tumor initiating and metastatic potential. In line with these observations, we demonstrate that ALK1Fc also reduces tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopic transplantation model, as well as in the human patient derived xenograft BM18. Furthermore, we also provide evidence for crosstalk between BMP9 and NOTCH and find that ALK1Fc inhibits NOTCH signaling in human prostate cancer cells and blocks the induction of the NOTCH target Aldehyde dehydrogenase member ALDH1A1, which is a clinically relevant marker associated with poor survival and advanced-stage prostate cancer. Our study provides the first demonstration that ALK1Fc inhibits prostate cancer progression, identifying BMP9 as a putative therapeutic target and ALK1Fc as a potential therapy. Altogether, these findings support the validity of ongoing clinical development of drugs blocking ALK1 and ALK2 receptor activity.""","""['Letizia Astrologo', 'Eugenio Zoni', 'Sofia Karkampouna', 'Peter C Gray', 'Irena Klima', 'Joël Grosjean', 'Marie J Goumans', 'Lukas J A C Hawinkels', 'Gabri van der Pluijm', 'Martin Spahn', 'George N Thalmann', 'Peter Ten Dijke', 'Marianna Kruithof-de Julio']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['BMP9, but not BMP10, acts as a quiescence factor on tumor growth, vessel normalization and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer.', 'Regulation of the ALK1 ligands, BMP9 and BMP10.', 'Molecular basis of ALK1-mediated signalling by BMP9/BMP10 and their prodomain-bound forms.', 'Fibroblast growth factor 2 inhibits bone morphogenetic protein 9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by repressing Smads signaling and subsequently reducing Smads dependent up-regulation of ALK1 and ALK2.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'The Dual Effect of the BMP9-ALK1 Pathway in Blood Vessels: An Opportunity for Cancer Therapy Improvement?', 'Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'BMP-9 is a novel marker for colorectal tumorigenesis undergoing the normal mucosa-adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence and is associated with colorectal cancer prognosis.']"""

Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that HOXB13 gene and protein expression did not differ between tumour samples from variant and wild-type carriers. Allele-specific transcription revealed that two of seven G84E carriers transcribed both the variant and wild-type allele, while five carriers transcribed the wild-type allele. Methylation of surrounding CpG sites was lower in the variant compared to the wild-type allele, however overall methylation across the region was very low.

PSA density is easily accessible, but early evidence on its use for biopsy decisions was conflicting and use of PSA density is not commonly recommended in guidelines.  Methods:   We analyzed biopsy outcomes in 5291 men in the population-based STHLM3 study with PSA ≥ 3 ng/ml and ultrasound-guided prostate volume measurements by using percentages and regression models. PSA density was calculated as total PSA (ng/ml) divided by prostate volume (ml). Main endpoint was clinically significant cancer (csPCa) defined as Gleason Score ≥ 7.  Results:   The median PSA-density was 0.10 ng/ml2 (IQR 0.075-0.14). PSA-density was associated with the risk of finding csPCa both with and without adjusting for the additional clinical information age, family history, previous biopsies, total PSA and free/total PSA (OR 1.06; 95% CI:1.05-1.07 and OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.08). Discrimination for csPCa was better when PSA density was added to a model with additional clinical information (AUC 0.75 vs. 0.73, P < 0.05). The proportion of men with Gleason Score 6 (ISUP 1) was similar across stratas of PSA-density. Omitting prostate biopsy for men with PSA-density ≤0.07 ng/ml2 would save 19.7% of biopsy procedures, while missing 6.9% of csPCa. PSA-density cutoffs of 0.10 ng/ml2 and 0.15 ng/ml2 resulted in detection of 77% (729/947) and 49% (461/947) of Gleason Score ≥7 tumors.

However, evidence is limited and still controversial, especially considering non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Methods:   Swedish nationwide population-based cohort study including all long-term (≥180 days) adult male users of aspirin (n = 419,931) or NSAIDs (n = 223,437) followed from the first dispense date until the first cancer diagnosis, death or 31 December 2012, whichever occurred first. The risk of prostate cancer was measured as standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), assessing duration of use, age and concomitant statins intake, comparing to the general male background population of the same age in Sweden.  Results:   The overall SIR suggests that maintenance use of aspirin decreases the risk of prostate cancer (SIR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.85-0.88), in particular if used ≥5 years (SIR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.30-0.32). The overall risk was decreased (SIR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.85-0.90) among other NSAIDs users, and again in particular among longer-term users (≥3 years) with SIR = 0.58 (95% CI 0.53-0.63). When statins users were excluded from all aspirin users, there was no remaining association with prostate cancer (SIR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.02), only if taken ≥5 years (SIR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.29-0.34). For non-aspirin NSAIDs users, the protective effect remained after exclusion of statins users (SIR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.95).

Anti-inflammatory substances can prevent carcinogenesis mediated by cytotoxic effects and can prevent DNA damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and apoptotic/antigenotoxic effects of horchata as well as its mechanism.  Methods:   Nine different varieties of horchata were prepared in the traditional way and then freeze-dried. Phytochemical screening tested for the presence of secondary metabolites using standard procedures and antioxidant activities. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated on cerebral astrocytoma (D-384), prostate cancer (PC-3), breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (RKO), lung cancer (A-549), immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and human peripheral blood lymphocytes via a MTS assay. The pro-apoptotic effects were evaluated with Anexin V/Propidium Iodide and western blot of Bax, Bcl-2, TP53, and TP73. Induction and reduction of ROS were assessed by fluorimetry. Genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects were evaluated with a comet assay and micronuclei on binucleated cells.  Results:   Five of nine horchatas had cytotoxic effects against D-384 while not affecting normal cells. These horchatas induce cell death by apoptosis modulated by p53/p73. In CHO-K1 cells, the horchatas decrease the damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and Mitomycin C measured in the comet and micronucleus assay respectively.  Conclusions:   The IC50 range of effective horchatas in D-384 was 41 to 122 μg·mL-1. This effect may be related to its use in traditional medicine (brain tonic). On the other hand, immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and lymphocytes did not show a cytotoxic effect. The most potent horchata induced apoptosis via a p53/p73-mediated mechanism.

ARs serve an important role during all stages of prostate cancer, and inhibiting their function may help to slow prostate cancer growth. In the present study, the AR gene was targeted in androgen‑positive prostate cancer cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats‑associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) system. A total of three different single‑guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed according to the three different target sites in the AR gene. The optimal sgRNA with a specific target effect was effectively screened to cleave the AR gene in androgen‑positive prostate cancer cell lines, and to suppress the growth of androgen‑sensitive prostate cancer in vitro. The AR‑sgRNA‑guided CRISPR/Cas system was able to disrupt the AR at specific sites and inhibit the growth of androgen‑sensitive prostate cancer cells; further studies demonstrated that the decreased cell proliferation was due to cellular apoptosis.

Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA and protein expression levels and transwell assay was conducted to determine cell invasion and migration. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the target association between miR‑138 and β‑catenin. The present study identified microRNA (miR)‑138 as an invasion and migration regulator in prostate cancer. miR‑138 was downregulated in aggressive prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, followingmiR‑138 overexpression, prostate cancer cells exhibited impaired invasive and migratory abilities. E‑cadherin was upregulated and vimentin was downregulated. In addition, it was demonstrated that miR‑138 negatively regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway activation in prostate cancer. The pathway was then activated via β‑catenin overexpression and this reversed the effects of miR‑138.

Methods:   One hundred thirty-seven consecutive PCa patients were submitted to RARP between September 2016 and February 2017 at two high-volume European centers. Before RARP, each patient was referred to 1.5T or 3T mpMRI. NS was recorded as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 according to Tewari and colleagues classification. A preliminary surgical plan to determinate the extent of NS approach was recorded based on clinical data. The final surgical plan was reassessed after mpMRI revision. The appropriateness of surgical plan change was considered based on the presence of extracapsular extension or positive surgical margins (PSMs) at level of neurovascular bundles area at final pathology. Furthermore, we analyzed a control group during the same period of 166 PCa patients referred to RARP in both institutions without preoperative mpMRI to assess the impact of the use of mpMRI on the surgical margins.  Results:   Considering 137 patients with preoperative mpMRI, the mpMRI revision induced the main surgeon to change the NS surgical plan in 46.7% of cases on patient-based and 56.2% on side-based analysis. The surgical plan change results equally assigned between the direction of more radical and less radical approach both on patient-based (54.7% vs 54.3%) and on side-based levels (50% vs 50%), resulting an overall appropriateness of 75%. Moreover, patients staged with mpMRI revealed significant lower overall PSMs compared with control group with no mpMRI (12.4% vs 24.1%; p ≤ 0.01).  Conclusions:   mpMRI induces robotic surgeons to change the surgical plan in almost half of individuals, thus tailoring the NS approach, without compromising the oncologic outcomes.

Patients and methods:   In addition to our previous study of 151 patients with PCa and BP after RP, we performed univariate analyses of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics during sRT. In 11 patients with BP or initiation of hormonal treatment (HT) within 180 days after sRT, risk factors were assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests. PSA doubling times (PSADT) before and after sRT in 82 patients with BP after sRT were compared by a Wilcoxon test.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 82 months, analysis of PSA kinetics during sRT did not show a statistically significant impact on a subsequent BP, PCSS, or overall survival at an administered dose of 30 or 45 Gy. The subgroup analysis of patients with early BP or early HT revealed higher Gleason scores (p = 0.008) and preoperative PSA values (p = 0.005), shorter PSADT prior to sRT (p < 0.0005), and longer time intervals from RP until the start of sRT (p = 0.005) compared to all other patients. In patients with subsequent BP, PSADTs were significantly prolonged after sRT (median PSADT 4.5 months before and 9.9 months after sRT, p < 0.0005).  Conclusion:   PSA monitoring during sRT did not predict the therapeutic success. Subgroup analysis suggests a lower probability of benefit for patients with the abovenamed risk factors .

Methods and materials:   During 1990-2010, 1898 prostate adenocarcinoma patients were treated with DE-EBRT to ≥75 Gy with ≥5 years follow-up. Patients receiving neoadjuvant/concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (n=1035) or with fewer than 4 PSA values obtained 6 months or more after post-EBRT completion (n=87) were excluded. The evaluable 776 patients were treated (median, 81.0 Gy). Prostate-specific antigen bounce was defined as a ≥0.2-ng/mL increase above the interval PSA nadir, followed by a decrease to nadir or below. Prostate-specific antigen relapse was defined as post-radiation therapy PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 9.2 years (interquartile range, 6.9-11.3 years).  Results:   One hundred twenty-three patients (15.9%) experienced PSA-B after DE-EBRT at a median of 24.6 months (interquartile range, 16.1-38.5 months). On multivariate analysis, younger age (P=.001), lower Gleason score (P=.0003), and higher radiation therapy dose (P=.0002) independently predicted PSA-B. Prostate-specific antigen bounce was independently associated with decreased risk for PSA relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.85; P=.008), distant metastatic disease (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.12-0.94; P=.04), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.96; P=.04) on multivariate Cox analysis.

We examined the association between ADT and overall survival in a national cohort of high-risk patients treated with EBRT with or without brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   We identified 46,325 men in the National Cancer Database with a diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 8-10, clinical stage T3-T4, or prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL) who were treated with EBRT with or without brachytherapy and ADT from 2004 through 2011. Multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for sociodemographic and clinicopathologic factors was used to identify the association between ADT and overall survival.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 48.6 and 59.2 months for patients treated with EBRT only and combined modality RT, respectively. ADT was associated with an improvement in overall survival for the 85.0% (39,361) of the study cohort who underwent EBRT alone (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, P=.001) but not for patients treated with combined modality RT (adjusted hazard ratio 1.05, P=.496), with a significant interaction (Pinteraction=.036).  Conclusions:   In contrast to the known survival benefit when ADT is given with EBRT, our results suggest that ADT might not improve survival for high-risk patients who undergo combined EBRT and brachytherapy. Given the significant adverse effects of ADT, in particular, with long-term therapy, a randomized controlled trial of combined EBRT and brachytherapy with or without ADT for select high-risk patients using a noninferiority design should be undertaken.""","""['David D Yang', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Phillip M Devlin', 'Martin T King', 'Peter F Orio rd']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Survival outcomes of combined external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy vs. brachytherapy alone for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients using the National Cancer Data Base.', 'Lack of Benefit From the Addition of External Beam Radiation Therapy to Brachytherapy for Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on survival in men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase I Trial of MRI-Guided Prostate Cancer Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) Boost Radiation Therapy.', 'Proton Beam Therapy Alone for Intermediate- or High-Risk Prostate Cancer: An Institutional Prospective Cohort Study.']"""

Numerous observational studies have suggested that RP is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer death, but whether results have been biased due to limited adjustments for confounding factors is unknown.  Objective:   To compare the risk of prostate cancer death after RT versus RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nationwide population-based observational study of men in the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 3.0 who had undergone RT or RP between 1998 and 2012.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate cancer deaths were compared. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated in Cox regression models, including clinical T stage, M stage, Gleason grade group, serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, proportion of biopsy cores with cancer, mode of detection, comorbidity, age, educational level, and civil status. Period analysis with left truncation was performed.  Results and limitations:   Primary treatment was RT or RP for 41 503 men. Treatment effect was associated with disease severity. In univariate analysis of RT versus RP, risk of prostate cancer death was higher after RT-low- and intermediate-risk cancer, HR 1.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53-2.16), and high-risk cancer, HR 1.57 (95% CI: 1.33-1.85). After full adjustment in period analysis, this difference between the treatments was attenuated-low- and intermediate-risk cancer, HR 1.24 (95% CI: 0.97-1.58), and high-risk cancer, HR 1.03 (95% CI: 0.81-1.31). Confounding remained due to nonrandom allocation to treatment.  Conclusions:   In comparison with previous studies, the difference in prostate cancer mortality after RT and RP was much smaller.

The evidence for a relationship with cancer risk, however, is not entirely consistent. This study aims to assess the relationships of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)), apoB-100, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) with risk of common cancer forms and total cancer mortality in comparison to incidence and mortality of CVD.  Methods:   We selected a case-cohort sample out of the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg study, including a random subcohort (n = 2739), and cases of cancer (n = 1632), cancer mortality (n = 761), CVD (n = 1070), and CVD mortality (n = 381). Concentrations of lipid biomarkers were measured in pre-diagnostic blood samples. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models.  Results:   High levels of circulating apoB-100 and TG were inversely associated and high HDL-C levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile (Q4 vs. Q1), HRapoB 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98; HRTG 0.65, 0.46-0.92; and HRHDL 1.39, 1.01-1.93). Higher levels of Lp(a) were associated with an increase in prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRLp(a) 1.43, 1.02-2.03) and high levels of apo(a) were associated with a decrease in lung cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRapo(a) 0.52, 0.30-0.91). High TC, HDL-C, apo(a), and Lp(a) levels were associated with a reduction in total cancer mortality (Q4 vs. Q1, HRTC 0.71, 0.54-0.94; HRHDL 0.67, 0.50-0.91; HRapo(a) 0.71, 0.54-0.93; and HRLp(a) 0.74, 0.57-0.98). All lipid biomarkers were associated with risk of myocardial infarction, whereby TC, apoB-100, TG, and Lp(a) were positively and HLD-C and apo(a) inversely associated with risk. Only high levels of TG were associated with an increased risk of stroke. None of the lipids were associated with risk of colorectal cancer and with risk of CVD mortality after multivariable adjustments.  Conclusions:   This prospective study demonstrates inverse associations of lipid biomarkers with cancer incidence and mortality, with the exception of positive associations of HDL-C and Lp(a) with breast and prostate cancer risk, respectively. Thus, the observed cancer risk pattern clearly differs from the CVD risk pattern.""","""['Verena Andrea Katzke', 'Disorn Sookthai', 'Theron Johnson', 'Tilman Kühn', 'Rudolf Kaaks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""[""Hierarchical modelling of blood lipids' profile and 10-year (2002-2012) all cause mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease: the ATTICA study."", 'Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and Apolipoprotein B and Cardiovascular Risk in Patients With Manifest Arterial Disease.', 'Circulating liver enzymes and risks of chronic diseases and mortality in the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg case-cohort study.', 'Modified risk associations of lipoproteins and apolipoproteins by chronic low-grade inflammation.', 'Nonfasting versus fasting lipid profile for cardiovascular risk prediction.', 'Relationship between lipoprotein(a) and colorectal cancer among inpatients: a retrospective study.', 'Favorable Effect of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol on Gastric Cancer Mortality by Sex and Treatment Modality.', 'Prognostic nomograms integrating preoperative serum lipid derivative and systemic inflammatory marker of patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing curative resection.', 'Circulating lipoprotein (a) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of breast cancer.']"""

Men in the screening group (n = 9950) were invited for biennial PSA testing up to the median age of 69 years. Prostate biopsy was recommended for men with PSA ≥2.5 ng/ml. Last follow-up was on 31 December 2012.  Results:   In the screening group, 77% (7647/9950) attended at least once. After 18 years, 1396 men in the screening group and 962 controls had been diagnosed with PC [hazard ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.64].

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 160 patients who suffered from biopsy proved prostatic carcinoma and performed radical prostatectomy. Age of the patients was 57-82 years, with the average age of 71.6; prebiopsy prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 0.31-40.32 μg/L,with the average PSA of 11.29 μg/L; body mass index (BMI) was 16.41-32.04 kg/m2, with the average BMI of 23.63 kg/m2; prostate volume (PV) was 9.52-148.46 mL, with the average PV of 40.19 mL. All the patients included in the study had complete information for clinical variables, including age, BMI, prebiopsy PSA level, PV, number of biopsy cores obtained, percentage, clinical stage, and biopsy GS. Grading of NB Gleason score was compared with their corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens, and the discrepancy between the NB and prostatectomy specimens GS assessed. Upgrading was defined as any increase in the pathological GS over that of the biopsy GS as a total sum of primary and secondary grades or a change in the order of primary and secondary grades towards higher ones. Univariable and multivariable Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of pathological grading changes.  Results:   Of the 160 patients, the specimen GS was upgraded in 49 (30.6%) patients and remained with no change in 82 (51.3%) patients. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that prostate volume and biopsy GS were independent predictors with postoperative upgrading of GS.

PSA is not specific and can be elevated by benign reasons. Additionally, a subgroup of patients with prostate hyperplasia may harbor prostate cancer (PCa). During monitoring, the clinician aims to detect significant tumors in time, submitting patients to minimal psychological and physical burden, especially in men with high serum PSA and repeat biopsies. We aimed to determine long-term outcomes with respect to ANNA/C-TRUS ability to detect PCa with six targeted biopsies.  Methods:   A subset of 71 patients were enrolled. During monitoring, they were subjected to primary, secondary, or even multiple prostate biopsies when needed. Protocol monitoring included PSA measurements, digital rectal examination (DRE) and imaging.  Results:   The median follow-up was 12 years. Forty-one patients had a history of negative systematic random biopsies (1-3 sessions). Their age ranges 62-85 years, PSA 0.5-47.3 ng/ml, and the median prostate volume 11-255 cc. During monitoring, 15 patients were diagnosed with PCa. Only two harbored aggressive tumors. The median time to diagnosis was 6 years. All PCa patients are free from biochemical relapse. From the remaining 56 patients, 11 did not have any biopsies, 12 had one, 13 had two, and 20 had three or more biopsy sessions.  Conclusions:   ANNA/C-TRUS is a useful method monitoring patients with a risk of PCa. 50-75% of the usually performed biopsy cores could be spared and, after 12 years, 97% of the patients were either without evidence of a PCa or were diagnosed with a good prognosis tumor.""","""['Theodoros Tokas', 'Björn Grabski', 'Udo Paul', 'Leif Bäurle', 'Tillmann Loch']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Computerized transrectal ultrasound (C-TRUS) of the prostate: detection of cancer in patients with multiple negative systematic random biopsies.', 'Prostate health index (PHI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predictive models for prostate cancer in the Chinese population and the role of digital rectal examination-estimated prostate volume.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer on repeat transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of magnetic resonance imaging techniques used to secure biopsies in prostate cancer patients.', 'Novel non-MRI imaging techniques for primary diagnosis of prostate cancer: micro-ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography, multiparametric ultrasound, and PSMA PET/CT.', 'Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

Methods:   This study included 114 consecutive mCRPC patients, comprising 54 and 60 patients who progressed with abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (Enz), respectively, before the introduction of docetaxel. The impact of the response to either ARAT agent on the activity of docetaxel was assessed.  Results:   Following ARAT therapy, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was observed in 73 of the 114 patients, of whom 33 and 40 received AA and Enz, respectively. In the 114 patients, PSA response to docetaxel was achieved in 48 (42.1%) patients, and median PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with docetaxel were 7.2 and 17.5 months, respectively. No significant difference was noted in PSA response rate, PSA PFS or OS with docetaxel between responders and non-responders to a prior ARAT agent in the overall 114 patients, 54 receiving AA and 60 receiving Enz. Despite the absence of a significant impact of the response to a prior ARAT agent on PSA PFS or OS by univariate analysis, independent prognostic predictors were identified by multivariate analysis, as performance status (PS) for PSA PFS, and PS and visceral metastasis for OS.  Conclusions:   Disease control by docetaxel may not be affected by the response to a prior ARAT agent.

However, the mechanism of PCAT7 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been identified. Hence, this study aimed to determine the function of PCAT7 in NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression level of PCAT7 in 96 pairs of NSCLC tissues and 6 cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, transwell/migration assay, and Western blotting assay were performed to detect the relation between PCAT7 and malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells in vitro, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rescue assays were carried out to confirm the contribution of PCAT7 to the progression of NSCLC cells by targeting miR-134-5p. RESULTS PCAT7 was found to be overexpressed in NSCLC tissues (compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues) and NSCLC cells (compared with normal cell line 16-HBE). Overexpression of PCAT7 resulted in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, inhibition of cells apoptosis, facilitation of cells metastasis, and formation of EMT phenotype, while PCAT7 expression deletion remarkably prohibited cell proliferation, accelerated their apoptosis, weakened metastasis, and reversed EMT to MET. miR-134-5P, as a target gene of PCAT7, restored the effects of down-regulation of PCAT7.

In this study, we conducted investigations to determine whether hand-holding during cystoscopy decreases patient anxiety, pain, and dissatisfaction while at the same time increasing patient comfort and tolerance during the procedure.  Patients and methods:   Eighty-six male patients who underwent flexible cystoscopy between November 2015 and March 2017 were randomized as follows: hand-holding (group I, n = 43) or non-hand-holding (group II, n = 43) during the procedure. Before flexible cystoscopy, lidocaine gel was instilled in the urethra. Patients' anxiety levels were quantified using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A visual analog scale (0-10) was used for self-assessment of satisfaction, discomfort, and willingness to undergo repeat cystoscopy.  Results:   Demographic characteristics, mean age, procedure duration, procedure indications, and preprocedural analyses did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. In group I, the postprocedural mean anxiety level, pain score, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were significantly lower compared with those in group II (p = 0.009, p = 0.003, p = 0.022, and p = 0.014, respectively). In group I, postprocedural mean satisfaction score were higher, and patients were more likely to undergo a repeat cystoscopy, compared with those in group II (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively).  Conclusions:   Hand-holding during cystoscopy significantly reduced patients' feelings of anxiety, pain, discomfort, and dissatisfaction.

Objective:   To determine the contemporary rate of biopsy-related infectious and noninfectious complications after TRUS-Bx, and identify potential risk factors associated with the complications.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective multicenter study and a substudy of a trial investigating the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in prostate cancer diagnosis (multi-IMPROD, NCT02241122).  Intervention:   TRUS-Bx was performed for all patients included in the study. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or fosfomycin was administered for antibiotic prophylaxis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   On inclusion, patients completed a detailed questionnaire and underwent MRI scanning. Antibiotic prophylaxis was prospectively recorded. After collection of a rectal swab, TRUS-Bx (total of 14-18 biopsy cores) was performed and. The rectal swabs were cultured and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Escherichia coli strains was analyzed. Biopsy complications leading to a visit to a health care unit were recorded and potential risk factors for complications were analyzed.  Results and limitations:   Twelve of the 294 patients (4.1%) had a biopsy-related complication, of which two (0.7%) were infectious and managed in the outpatient setting. Some 11% of the patients had an E. coli strain resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic administered.  Conclusions:   The risk of an infectious or noninfectious complication after TRUS-Bx is very low, although the FQ resistance rate in the study population was significant. Accordingly, the present TRUS-Bx procedure and antibiotic prophylaxis are efficient in guarding against biopsy complications, but regional resistance rates may affect the generalizability of the results.  Patient summary:   We examined the rate of complications after prostate biopsies in 294 patients. The risk of having a biopsy-related complication was low (4.1%).

Aim:   To present the feasibility and safety of penile length and girth restoration based on the so-called multiple-slit technique (MUST) for patients with severe ED and significant penile shortening with or without PD.  Methods:   From July 2013 through January 2016, 138 patients underwent the MUST. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction were completed.  Outcomes:   Outcome analysis was focused on penile length restoration, penile curvature correction, intra- and postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction.  Results:   138 patients underwent the procedure (103 malleable and 35 inflatable devices). Etiologies of penile shortening and narrowing were PD, severe ED, post-radical prostatectomy, and androgen-deprivation therapy with or without brachytherapy or external radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and post-penile fracture in 60.1%, 24.6%, 10.1%, 3.6%, and 2.2%, respectively. In PD cases, the mean deviation of the penile axis was 55° (range = 0-90°). Mean subjective penile length loss reported was 3.2 cm (range = 1-5 cm), and shaft constriction was present in 44.9%. Median follow-up was 15.2 months (range = 6-36 months). Mean penile length gain was 3.1 cm (range = 2-5 cm). No penile prosthesis infection caused device explantation. One glans necrosis was encountered. The average IIEF score increased from 22 points at baseline to 66 points at 6-month follow-up.  Clinical implications:   The MUST helps address penile size issues in cases of severe ED with concomitant conditions that impair penile length or girth.  Strengths and limitations:   The strength of the study is its applicability to provide surgeons with a solution for cases in which patients have severe ED and penile size impairment owing to underlying conditions such as PD. The study is limited by the relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions:   The MUST is an effective, safe, and viable treatment option for a selected patient cohort. Because of the potential complications, proper counseling should take place and only experienced surgeons should perform this type of surgery. Egydio PH, Kuehhas FE.

Patients and methods:   The present study included 222 consecutive mCRPC patients with progression during initial androgen receptor-axis-targeted agent (ARATA) therapy with either abiraterone acetate (AA) or enzalutamide (Enz). Of these 222 patients, 108 subsequently received an alternative ARATA (AA-to-Enz, n = 49; Enz-to-AA, n = 59) and 114 received docetaxel (DTX; AA-to-DTX, n = 54; Enz-to-DTX, n = 60).  Results:   The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in the 114 patients receiving DTX was significantly greater than that in the 108 patients receiving ARATA. However, no significant differences were found in the remaining parameters between the 2 groups. The PSA response rate, PSA progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) during second-line therapy in the DTX group (n = 114) were significantly superior to those for the ARATA group (n = 108; PSA response rate, 42.1% vs. 21.3%; median PSA PFS, 7.2 vs. 4.2 months; median OS, 17.5 vs. 14.5 months). Similar trends were confirmed by comparing these outcomes among 4 therapy groups, with significant differences (PSA response rate, Enz-to-AA vs. AA-to-DTX and Enz-to-AA vs. Enz-to-DTX; PSA PFS, AA-to-Enz vs. Enz-to-AA, AA-to-Enz vs. AA-to-DTX, Enz-to-AA vs. AA-to-DTX, and Enz-to-AA vs. Enz-to-DTX; and OS, Enz-to-AA vs. AA-to-DTX and Enz-to-AA vs. Enz-to-DTX). Furthermore, the introduction of DTX was independently associated with improved PSA PFS, but not OS, on multivariate analysis.

Results:   Fourty-three patients (23.1% of total cohort) with preoperative clinically LAPCa patients were down-staged to pOCD following RARP. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, preoperative PSAD, positive core percent, maximal tumor volume in any core, and biopsy Gleason score were significantly associated with down-staging into pOCD following RARP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower preoperative PSA (≤10 ng/mL) and maximal tumor volume in any core (≤70%) were independent predictors of pOCD following RARP.

However, it is currently unknown whether use of antihyperuricemic medication is associated with risk of developing BPH. We studied the association between BPH and use of antihyperuricemic allopurinol in a Finnish population-based cohort.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 74,754 men originally identified for the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC). Information on gout and BPH medication usage (5α-reductase inhibitors, 5ARIs) during 1996-2014 was obtained from the National medication reimbursement database. Information on BPH diagnoses from in- and outpatient hospital visits and BPH-related surgery was obtained from the National Health Care Registry. Men with a record of BPH at baseline was excluded. We used Cox regression to analyze risk of starting BPH medication, having a recorded diagnosis or undergoing BPH surgery by allopurinol use with adjustment for age and simultaneous use of statins, antidiabetic or antihypertensive drugs and aspirin or other NSAIDs. Medication use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable to minimize immortal time bias.  Results:   Men using allopurinol had a decreased risk for all three BPH endpoints: BPH medication (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75-0.88), BPH diagnosis (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71-0.86) and BPH-related surgery (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58-0.76) after multivariable adjustment. The risk association did not change by cumulative use. The risk decrease disappeared after 1-2 years lag time. Only BMI modified the risk association; the risk decrease was observed only among men with BMI above the median (27.3 kg/m2); p for interaction <0.05 for each endpoint.  Conclusions:   We found that allopurinol use is associated with lowered risk of BPH medication, diagnosis and surgery.

This makes ytterbium (Yb)-169, which emits photons with an average energy of 93 keV (just above the K-edge of gold), an ideal radioisotope for such purposes. This investigation tests the feasibility of tumor-specific prostate brachytherapy achievable with Yb-169 and actively targeted GNPs, using an external beam surrogate of Yb-169 created from an exotic filter material - erbium (Er) and a standard copper-filtered 250 kVp beam. The current in vitro study shows that treatment of prostate cancer cells with goserelin-conjugated gold nanorods (gGNRs) promotes gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor-mediated internalization and enhances radiosensitivity to both Er-filtered and standard 250 kVp beams, 14 and 10%, respectively. While the degree of GNP-mediated radiosensitization as seen from the in vitro study may be considered moderate, the current in vivo study shows that gGNR treatment plus Er-filtered x-ray irradiation is considerably more effective than radiation treatment alone (p < 0.0005), resulting in a striking reduction in tumor volume (50% smaller) 2 months following treatment.

The average annual population of Lahore was 9.8 million in 2010-2012. This is a sequel to a study published earlier.  Design:   A cross-sectional study.  Setting:   The registry has 19 centres in Lahore reporting their data to the coordinating office located within the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH&RC), Lahore, Pakistan.  Participants:   Data existing in the PCR database, based on a confirmed diagnosis of cancer from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012, among the Lahore residents, were reviewed.  Outcome measures:   Cancer counts and the age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR) per 100 000 population were computed by gender, cancer site/type and age group (0-14, 15-19 and ≥20 years).  Results:   Between 2010 and 2012, of the 15 840 new cancers diagnosed, 57% were in females.

Objective:   With larger sample size and longer follow-up, the objective of this study update is to assess whether our previous findings are upheld and whether the improved PSM rates for RARP after an initial learning curve compared with ORP-as observed in our earlier analysis-ultimately resulted in improved biochemical control.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective observational study comparing two surgical techniques; 2271 consecutive men underwent RARP (1520) or ORP (751) at a single centre from 2006 to 2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic and clinicopathological data were prospectively collected. The EPIC-QOL questionnaire was administered at baseline and 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. Multivariate linear regression modelled the difference in quality of life (QOL) domains against case number; logistic and Cox regression modelled the differences in PSM and biochemical recurrence (BCR) hazard ratios (HR), respectively.  Results and limitations:   A total of 2206 men were included in BCR/PSM analysis and 1045 consented for QOL analysis. Superior pT2 surgical margins, early and late sexual outcomes, and early urinary outcomes were upheld and became more robust (narrowing of 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). The risk of BCR was initially higher for RARP, improved after 191 RARPs, and was 35% lower (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90) at final RARP, plateauing after 226 RARPs. Improved late (12-24 mo) urinary bother scores (adjusted mean difference [AMD]=4.7, 95% CI 1.3-8.0) and irritative-obstructive scores (AMD=3.8, 95% CI 0.9-5.6) at final RARP were demonstrated. Limitations include observational single surgeon data, possible residual confounding, and short follow-up.

However, data are limited regarding the impact of age on perioperative outcomes following RP. We examined the association of age with perioperative outcomes following RP to inform risk-stratification and management.  Materials and methods:   We identified 35,968 men aged 18 to 89 years who underwent RP from 2010 to 2015 in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. The associations of age with 30-day complications and perioperative morbidity were evaluated using logistic regression, adjusted for patient features. Age was modeled both as a categorical and nonlinear continuous variable.  Results:   Median age at surgery was 63 years (IQR: 58-67). Increasing age was associated with greater rates of perioperative morbidity. Compared to men aged<60 years, men aged 70 to 89 years had statistically significantly higher rates of 30-day complications (6.4% vs. 4.4%, P<0.0001), perioperative blood transfusion (6.0% vs. 3.7%, P<0.0001), readmission (4.9% vs. 3.9%, P<0001), and 30-day mortality (0.3% vs. 0.1%, P<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, older age was independently associated with increased risks of perioperative morbidity. Moreover, there was a nonlinear relationship of age with perioperative morbidity, wherein rates of 30-day complications, perioperative blood transfusion, and readmission increased after approximately 70 years of age.  Conclusions:   In this national cohort, we observed a nonlinear association of age with perioperative morbidity, with increasing rates of 30-day complications, perioperative blood transfusion, and readmission after approximately 70 years of age. These results have implications for risk-stratification, patient counseling, and treatment selection among older men.""","""['Jorge F Pereira', 'Dragan Golijanin', 'Gyan Pareek', 'Ruiting Guo', 'Zheng Zhang', 'Joseph Renzulli nd', 'Boris Gershman M D']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The association of lymph node dissection with 30-day perioperative morbidity among men undergoing minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP).', 'Perioperative Morbidity of Open Versus Minimally Invasive Partial Nephrectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'A Multi-institutional Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes in 106 Men Who Underwent Radical Prostatectomy for Distant Metastatic Prostate Cancer at Presentation.', 'Open and robot-assisted radical retropubic prostatectomy in men receiving ongoing low-dose aspirin medication: revisiting an old paradigm?', 'The impact of perioperative blood transfusion on survival and recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status System and Risk of Major Clavien-Dindo Complications After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy at Hospital Discharge: Analysis of 1143 Consecutive Prostate Cancer Patients."", 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Advanced Age Is a Risk Factor for Complications Following Abdominal Panniculectomy.']"""

We explored, using individual patient data, week 13 circulating tumor cell (CTC) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response end points in five prospective randomized phase III trials that enrolled a total of 6,081 patients-COU-AA-301, AFFIRM, ELM-PC-5, ELM-PC-4, and COMET-1- ClinicalTrials.Gov identifiers: NCT00638690, NCT00974311, NCT01193257, NCT01193244, and NCT01605227, respectively. Methods Eight response end points were explored. CTC nonzero at baseline and 0 at 13 weeks (CTC0); CTC conversion (≥ 5 CTCs at baseline, ≤ 4 at 13 weeks-the US Food and Drug Administration cleared response measure); a 30%, 50%, and 70% decrease in CTC count; and a 30%, 50%, and 70% decrease in PSA level. Patients missing week-13 values were considered nonresponders. The discriminatory strength of each end point with respect to overall survival in each trial was assessed using the weighted c-index. Results Of the eight response end points, CTC0 and CTC conversion had the highest weighted c-indices, with smaller standard deviations. For CTC0, the mean (standard deviation) was 0.81 (0.04); for CTC conversion, 0.79 (0.03); for 30% decrease in CTC count, 0.72 (0.06); for 50% decrease in CTC count, 0.72 (0.06); for 70% decrease in CTC count, 0.73 (0.05); for 30% decrease in PSA level, 0.71 (0.03); for 50% decrease in PSA level, 0.72 (0.06); and for 70% decrease in PSA level, 0.74 (0.05). Seventy-five percent of eligible patients could be evaluated with the CTC0 end point, compared with 51% with the CTC conversion end point.

It is necessary and valuable to develop powerful and effective computational models to predict potential associations between miRNAs and diseases. In this work, we presented a prediction model of Graphlet Interaction for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (GIMDA) by integrating the disease semantic similarity, miRNA functional similarity, Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the experimentally confirmed miRNA-disease associations. The related score of a miRNA to a disease was calculated by measuring the graphlet interactions between two miRNAs or two diseases. The novelty of GIMDA lies in that we used graphlet interaction to analyse the complex relationships between two nodes in a graph. The AUCs of GIMDA in global and local leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) turned out to be 0.9006 and 0.8455, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Pa-PDT in gradient concentrations (0 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, and 4 μM) were used to act on PC-3 cells; the cell proliferation in each group was detected via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and clone formation assay, and the cell apoptosis was detected via Hochst33258 staining and Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double labeling. Moreover, the effects of Pa-PDT on invasion and proliferation of PC-3 cells were observed via wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay. Finally, the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in each group were detected after treatment by Western blotting.  Results:   MTT and clone formation assays showed that Pa-PDT could inhibit the proliferation of PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results of apoptosis assay revealed that Pa-PDT could significantly promote the apoptosis of PC-3 cells, obviously up-regulate the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (BAX), Caspase-3 and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP), and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2. Besides, the wound healing assay and Transwell chamber assay showed that Pa-PDT could inhibit the invasion and metastasis capacities of PC-3 cells, whose relevant mechanisms were related to the fact that Pa-PDT inhibited the EMT process and down-regulated the expressions of MMPs in PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   Pa-PDT can inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of PC-3 cells.

Our goal was to investigate the potential of H&E as counterstaining (H&E-IHC) to allow for visualization of a marker while confirming the diagnosis on the same slide. The quality of immunostaining and the fast-technical performance were the main criteria to select the final protocol. We stained multiple diagnostic tissues with class I IHC tests with different subcellular localization markers (anti-CK7, CK20, synaptophysin, CD20, HMB45, and Ki-67) and with double-staining on prostate tissues with anti-high molecular weight keratins/p63 (DAB detection) and p504s (alkaline phosphatase detection). To validate the efficacy of the counterstaining, we stained tissue microarrays from the Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control (cIQc) with class II IHC tests (ER, PR, HER2, and p53 markers). Interobserver and intraobserver concordance was assessed by κ statistics. Excellent agreement of H&E-IHC interpretation was observed in comparison with standard IHC from our laboratory (κ, 0.87 to 1.00), and with the cIQc reference values (κ, 0.81 to 1.00).

Knockdown of PGAM1 by siRNA in PC-3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis. In a nude mouse xenograft model, PGAM1 knockdown markedly suppressed tumor growth. Deletion of PGAM1 resulted in decreased expression of Bcl-2, enhanced expression of Bax, caspases-3 and inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression.

Methods:   The study population comprised men with intermediate-high risk CaP captured in the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcome Registry Victoria (PCOR-Vic), treated with EBRT from January 2010 to December 2015. The primary outcome is the proportion of men who received HDR-BT boost. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to evaluate the effect of patient-, tumour- and treatment-factors on the likelihood of HDR-BT use. Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) data was accessed to evaluate the Australia-wide pattern of HDR-BT use.  Results:   One thousand eight hundred and six patients were included in this study - 886 (49%) intermediate-risk, and 920 (51%) high-risk CaP patients. Overall, only 124 (7%) patients had EBRT + HDR-BT - 47 (5%) intermediate-risk and 77 (8%) high-risk CaP patients (P = 0.01). There is higher proportion of patients who had HDR-BT in public institutions (7% public vs. 3% private, P = 0.005) and in metropolitan centres (9% metropolitan vs. 2% regional, P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, older patients were less likely to have HDR-BT (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.89-0.94, P < 0.001), while patients with high-risk CaP (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3-2.7; P = 0.002) treated in metropolitan centres (OR = 5.0; 95% CI = 2.6-9.8; P < 0.001) and public institutions (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.5-9.4; P = 0.005) were more likely to have EBRT + HDR-BT. There was significant decline in numbers of HDR-BT performed throughout Australia, from 313 cases in 2010 to 125 cases in 2015.  Conclusion:   High-dose-rate brachytherapy is under-utilised with EBRT in this contemporary population-based cohort of Victorian men with CaP.

Nevertheless, the functions of Cap in prostate cancer have not been fully explored. We evaluated the potential actions of Cap on the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells.  Materials and methods:   Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were measured by water-soluble tetrazolium-1 and flow cytometry assays. The expression of cyclins, p21, p27, survivin, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP2 and MMP9) were assessed by immunoblotting assays. Effects of Cap on invasion and migration were determined by wound closure and matrigel transmigration assays. The constitutive and interlukin-6 (IL-6)-inducible STAT3 activation of prostate carcinoma cells were determined by immunoblotting and reporter assays.  Results:   Capillarisin inhibited androgen-independent DU145 and androgen-dependent LNCaP cell growth through the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase by upregulating p21 and p27 while downregulating expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A and cyclin B. Cap decreased protein expression of survivin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 and therefore blocked the migration and invasion of DU145 cells. Cap suppressed constitutive and IL-6-inducible STAT3 activation in DU145 and LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that Cap blocked cell growth by modulation of p21, p27 and cyclins. The inhibitory effects of Cap on survivin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and STAT3 activation may account for the suppression of invasion in prostate carcinoma cells.

Routine and consultation cases were reviewed for histologically and immunohistochemically proven SNT LMS. The tumors were tested with antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon, HMB45, S100 protein, Rb1, MDM2, CDK4 and EBV (EBER-ISH). Nine tumors affecting 5 males and 4 females aged 26 to 77 years (median: 48 years) were identified in the maxillary sinus (n = 4), nasal cavity (n = 3) and combined SNT (n = 2). Three patients had previous irradiation (2 for retinoblastoma, 1 for fibrous dysplasia) and 1 patient had chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma. One patient had prostatic adenocarcinoma (prior) and rectal adenocarcinoma (post) to the LMS. All patients with follow-up developed either local recurrences and/or metastases, principally to lung (time to metastasis: 16-156 months, mean 62 months). Histologically, 6 tumors were conventional high-grade LMS, two had glycogen-rich clear cell (PEComa-like) morphology and one was spindle cell low-grade. The latter showed grade 2 in the recurrence and grade 3 in the lung metastases. Two cases showed dedifferentiation to anaplastic pleomorphic (inflammatory MFH-like) phenotype. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse expression of at least 2 smooth muscle markers in 8 and only actin in one case/s. All other markers were negative. RB1 loss was observed in 6/8 cases tested.

Whole-pelvic prostate radiotherapy (WPRT) involves large concave target volumes, which present a challenge for volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) optimization. This study evaluates automated VMAT planning for WPRT-VMAT and compares the results with manual expert planning.  Methods:   A system for fully automated multi-criterial plan generation was configured for each step of sequential-boost WPRT-VMAT, with final ""autoVMAT"" plans being automatically calculated by the Monaco treatment planning system (TPS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Configuration was based on manually generated VMAT plans (manualVMAT) of 5 test patients, the planning protocol, and discussions with the treating physician on wishes for plan improvements. AutoVMAT plans were then generated for another 30 evaluation patients and compared to manualVMAT plans. For all 35 patients, manualVMAT plans were optimized by expert planners using the Monaco TPS.  Results:   AutoVMAT plans exhibited strongly improved organ sparing and higher conformity compared to manualVMAT. On average, mean doses (Dmean) of bladder and rectum were reduced by 10.7 and 4.5 Gy, respectively, by autoVMAT. Prostate target coverage (V95%) was slightly higher (+0.6%) with manualVMAT. In a blinded scoring session, the radiation oncologist preferred autoVMAT plans to manualVMAT plans for 27/30 patients. All treatment plans were considered clinically acceptable. The workload per patient was reduced by > 70 min.

The system employs a detection probe that specifically binds to the target miRNA and sequentially releases a catalyst strand (CS) intended to trigger the subsequent TMSD reaction. Thus, the presence of target miRNA releases the CS that mediates the formation of an active G-quadruplex DNAzyme which is initially caged and inactivated by a blocker strand. In addition, a fuel strand that is supplemented for the recycling of the CS promotes another TMSD reaction, consequently generating a large number of active G-quadruplex DNAzymes. As a result, a distinct colorimetric signal is produced by the ABTS oxidation promoted by the peroxidase mimicking activity of the released G-quadruplex DNAzymes. Based on this novel strategy, we successfully detected miR-141, a promising biomarker for human prostate cancer, with high selectivity.

This clinical study presents an intraindividual comparison to evaluate tracer-specific characteristics of 18F-DCFPyL versus 18F-PSMA-1007. Methods: Twelve prostate cancer patients, drug-naïve or before surgery, received similar activities of about 250 MBq of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007 48 h apart and were imaged 2 h after injection on the same PET/CT scanner using the same reconstruction algorithm. Normal-organ biodistribution and tumor uptake were quantified using SUVmaxResults: PSMA-positive lesions were detected in 12 of 12 prostate cancer patients. Both tracers, 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007, detected the same lesions. No statistical significance could be observed when comparing the SUVmax of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007 for local tumor, lymph node metastases, and bone metastases. With regard to normal organs, 18F-DCFPyL had statistically significant higher uptake in kidneys, urinary bladder, and lacrimal gland. Vice versa, significantly higher uptake of 18F-PSMA-1007 in muscle, submandibular and sublingual gland, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder was observed. Conclusion: Excellent imaging quality was achieved with both 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007, resulting in identical clinical findings for the evaluated routine situations. Nonurinary excretion of 18F-PSMA-1007 might present some advantage with regard to delineation of local recurrence or pelvic lymph node metastasis in selected patients; the lower hepatic background might favor 18F-DCFPyL in late stages, when rare cases of liver metastases can occur.""","""['Frederik L Giesel', 'Leon Will', 'Ismaheel Lawal', 'Thabo Lengana', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Mariza Vorster', 'Oliver Neels', 'Florette Reyneke', 'Uwe Haberkon', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Mike Sathekge']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective intraindividual comparison of 18F-PSMA-7Q and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', '18F-PSMA-1007 PET in Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT versus 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer (PYTHON): a prospective, open label, cross-over, comparative study.', 'The role of 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI radiomics for pathological grade group prediction in prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant Therapy for High-Risk Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma: Current Landscape and Future Direction.', 'PSMA PET/CT: joint EANM procedure guideline/SNMMI procedure standard for prostate cancer imaging 2.0.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Companion Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical, 18FPSMA-1007, in a Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.']"""

The uptake and endosome escape efficiency of bombesin/oligoarginine and bombesin/oligoarginine/GALA fusion peptides for oligonucleotide delivery was evaluated in terms of their complex size, cellular uptake, endosome escape, and cellular toxicity. Complex size and cell uptake studies demonstrated that the nona-arginine/bombesin delivery system was more efficient at condensing and delivering pDNA into PC-3 prostate cancer cells compared to the hexa-arginine/bombesin delivery system. Further, competition with free bombesin peptide, and comparative uptake studies in Caco-2 cells, which express GRPR at a lower level, suggested that GRPR contributes to the targeted uptake of this system. The addition of GALA into the nona-arginine/bombesin-based system further increased the pDNA cellular uptake at all tested N/P ratios; facilitated endosomal pDNA release; and had limited effects on cell viability.

Methods and materials:   Patients with mostly favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated on this prospective phase II trial with brachytherapy as monotherapy, without hormonal therapy. QoL was recorded at baseline and each follow-up by using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite instrument. The minimal clinically important difference was defined as half the standard deviation of the baseline score for each domain. Mixed effect models were used to compare the different isotopes, and time-driven activity-based costing was used to compute costs.  Results:   From 2006 to 2013, 300 patients were treated with iodine-125 (I-125, n = 98, prescribed dose [PD] = 145 Gy), palladium-103 (Pd-103, n = 102, PD = 125 Gy), or cesium-131 (Cs-131, n = 100, PD = 115 Gy). Median age was 64.9 years. Median follow-up time was 5.1 years for the entire cohort, and 7.1, 4.8 and 3.3 years for I-125, Pd-103, and Cs-131 groups, respectively. All three isotope groups showed an initial drop in QoL at first follow-up, which gradually improved over the first 2 years for urinary and bowel domains. QoL profiles were similar between I-125 and Pd-103, whereas Cs-131 showed a statistically significant decrease in QoL regarding bowel and sexual function at 12 months compared with Pd-103. However, these differences did not reach the minimal clinically important difference. Compared with I-125, the use of Pd-103 or Cs-131 resulted in cost increases of 18% and 34% respectively.  Conclusions:   The three different isotopes produced a similar QoL profile.

Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate several cellular processes and have an important role in many human malignancies including PCa. We assessed the sRNA profiles associated with PCa in Arabs, a population that has rarely been studied.  Methods:   We used next generation sequencing technology to obtain the entire sRNA transcriptome of primary prostate tumor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and their paired non-tumor tissues, collected from Bedouin patients (Qatari and Saudi). The miRNA and the target gene expression were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. miRNA KEGG pathway and miRNA target genes were subsequently analyzed by starBase and TargetScan software.  Results:   Different expression patterns of several sRNA and miRNA editing were revealed between PCa tumor and their paired non-tumor tissues. Our study identified four miRNAs that are strongly associated with prostate cancer, which have not been reported previously. Differentially expressed miRNAs significantly affect various biological pathways, such as cell cycle, endocytosis, adherence junction and pathways involved in cancer. Prediction of potential targets for the identified miRNAs indicates the overexpression of KRAS, BCL2 and down-regulation of PTEN in PCa tumor tissues.  Conclusion:   These miRNAs, newly associated with prostate cancer, may represent not only markers for the increased risk of PCa in Arabs, but may also reflect the clinical and pathological diversity as well as the ethno-specific heterogeneity of prostate cancer.""","""['Jingxuan Shan', 'Khalid Al-Rumaihi', 'Karim Chouchane', 'Issam Al-Bozom', 'Danny Rabah', 'Karim Farhat', 'Lotfi Chouchane']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic signatures from the small non-coding RNA transcriptome in prostate cancer.', 'Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs Role in Prostate Cancer.', 'Reference Genes for qPCR-Based miRNA Expression Profiling in 14 Human Tissues.', 'MicroRNAs as Guardians of the Prostate: Those Who Stand before Cancer.

Chronic inflammation might play important roles in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are often recruited to the tumor microenvironment due to local inflammation. We have asked whether stimulation of MSCs by pro-inflammatory cytokines could promote prostate tumor growth. The current study investigated the possible involvement of MSCs stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in promotion and angiogenesis of prostate cancer through relative pathway in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   A syngeneic mouse model of C57 was established. The murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) mixing with MSCs treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or vehicle were subcutaneously injected into C57 mice. Tumor volume of C57 mouse model was estimated and serum level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was test by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). A hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay was applied to test the effect of conditioned media of stimulated MSCs in chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) knocked down either hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) or nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) were employed. mRNA of PDGF and VEGF in MSCs, as well as NRF2 and HIF-1α was test by Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Protein expression levels of PDGF and VEGF from conditioned medium, NRF2, HIF-1α, as well as PDGF and VEGF in MSCs were detected by Western blot analysis.  Results:   MSCs treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ promote tumor growth in C57 syngeneic mouse model, correlating with increased serum level of PDGF, VEGF. HET-CAM assay shows the angiogenic effect of conditioned medium of MSCs pre-treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines. mRNA and protein levels of two pro-angiogenic factors (PDGF and VEGF) and key hypoxia regulators (HIF-1α and NRF2) in MSCs were induced after MSCs' pretreatment. siRNA knockdown either HIF-1α or NRF2 results reduction of PDGF and VEGF expression.

However, the gold standard procedure required to identify true positive histological cancer is a full autopsy of the gland which is not possible in screening studies, leading to verification bias. We aim to estimate the sensitivity of a prostate cancer screening round (PSA result to diagnosis) relative to histological cancer.  Methods:   We developed a framework combining data on UK screened and non-screened prostate cancer populations originating from a single round of population-based PSA testing among UK men aged 50-69 years, prostate cancer incidence data, and needle biopsy data from the published literature.  Results:   Sensitivity of a screening round was highest at age 65-69 years at 33% (95% CI: 30%-37%) and 24% (95% CI: 21%-28%) for PSA cut-off levels of 3 ng/ml and 4 ng/ml, respectively. Sensitivity was lowest at age 50-54 at 15% (95% CI: 12%-17%) and 9% (95% CI: 8%-11%) for PSA cut-off levels of 3 ng/ml and 4 ng/ml, respectively. In contrast, the clinical detection rate in the absence of mass screening, relative to histological cancer, varied between 0.2%-0.7% at age 50-54 and 1.2%-2.7% at age 65-69 from 1995 to 2012.

Methods:   Parameters were estimated by fitting the two Tofts-based perfusion models to the acquired data via non-linear least squares. We apply Variable Projection (VP) to convert the fitting problem from a multi-dimensional to a one-dimensional line search to improve computational efficiency and robustness. Using simulation and DCE-MRI studies in twenty patients with suspected prostate cancer, the VP-based solver was compared against the traditional Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) strategy for accuracy, noise amplification, robustness to converge, and computation time.  Results:   The simulation demonstrated that VP and LM were both accurate in that the medians closely matched assumed values across typical signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels for both Tofts models. VP and LM showed similar noise sensitivity. Studies using the patient data showed that the VP method reliably converged and matched results from LM with approximate 3× and 2× reductions in computation time for the standard (two-parameter) and extended (three-parameter) Tofts models. While LM failed to converge in 14% of the patient data, VP converged in the ideal 100%.  Conclusion:   The VP-based method for non-linear least squares estimation of perfusion parameters for prostate MRI is equivalent in accuracy and robustness to noise, while being more reliably (100%) convergent and computationally about 3× (TM) and 2× (ETM) faster than the LM-based method.""","""['Soudabeh Kargar', 'Eric A Borisch', 'Adam T Froemming', 'Akira Kawashima', 'Lance A Mynderse', 'Eric G Stinson', 'Joshua D Trzasko', 'Stephen J Riederer']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Optimized Fast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate: Effect of Sampling Duration on Pharmacokinetic Parameters.', 'DCE-MRI of the prostate using shutter-speed vs. Tofts model for tumor characterization and assessment of aggressiveness.', 'Robust estimation of hemo-dynamic parameters in traditional DCE-MRI models.', 'Fitting the two-compartment model in DCE-MRI by linear inversion.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion tensor imaging pipeline measures of cerebral white matter integrity: An overview of recent advances and prospects.', 'Role of MRI-Based Functional Imaging in Improving the Therapeutic Index of Radiotherapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'Soft Tissue Sarcoma Stiffness and Perfusion Evaluation by MRE and DCE-MRI for Radiation Therapy Response Assessment: A Technical Feasibility Study.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI with intravoxel incoherent motion modeling for assessment of muscle perfusion in the thigh during post-exercise hyperemia in younger and older adults.']"""

Orthotopic VCaP xenograft growth and subcutaneous MDA133-4 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor growth was reduced by single agent treatment, but significantly greater suppression was observed in the combination treatment group. Although overall microvessel densities in the tumor tissues were not different among the different treatment groups, a significant reduction in large blood vessels (>100 μm2 ) was observed in tumors following combination treatment.

Results:   All of BKV VP1 genes which were derived from Iranian patients were classified with subtype 1b2 strains from Germany and Turkey. Predicted amino acid sequences from the studied region of VP1 showed that all of these nucleotide diversities could change amino acid sequence numbers 60, 68, 72, 73 and 82 among VP1.  Conclusion:   The interesting point was that genetic analysis of derived sequences showed a different feature of genetic diversity among Iranian sequences. This feature has not been reported yet.

Here, we investigate the anticancer efficacy and associated mechanisms of isoliquiritigenin in human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22RV1 cells. Isoliquiritigenin (25-50μM) inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in vitro. This agent also repressed the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors in vivo with the results of hematoxylin/eosin staining and immunohistochemistry staining showing differences between isoliquiritigenin-treated groups and control group. Next, we used microarray transcriptional profiling to identify isoliquiritigenin-regulated genes on PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Multiple genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis signaling pathways were changed remarkably with the treatment of isoliquiritigenin. Molecular studies revealed that G2/M arrest was associated with a decrease in cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), and phosphorylated CDK1 (Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr161), whereas the expression of 14-3-3σ and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) was increased. The complexes of cyclin B1-CDK1 were also examined to show a decrease in the binding of CDK1 with cyclin B1. In addition, treatment with relatively high concentrations of isoliquiritigenin induced apoptosis, mainly associated with enhancing apoptosis regulator (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio. Collectively, these findings indicate that isoliquiritigenin modulates cyclin B1-CDK1 for G2/M arrest, together with an alteration of cell cycle regulators and apoptotic factors in human prostate cancer cells. However, we observed pleiotropic effects for isoliquiritigenin in microarray results, suggesting that other biological mechanisms also contribute to its efficacy, which could be of interest for future investigations.""","""['Biyan Zhang', 'Yun Lai', 'Yufeng Li', 'Nan Shu', 'Zheng Wang', 'Yanping Wang', 'Yunsen Li', 'Zijun Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Millepachine, a novel chalcone, induces G2/M arrest by inhibiting CDK1 activity and causing apoptosis via ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Anti-tumor activity of SL4 against breast cancer cells: induction of G2/M arrest through modulation of the MAPK-dependent p21 signaling pathway.', 'Bufotalin from Venenum Bufonis inhibits growth of multidrug resistant HepG2 cells through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Molecular chemotherapeutic potential of butein: A concise review.', 'Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) and its Formulations: Potential Antitumor Agents.', 'Hybrid Membrane-Derived Nanoparticles for Isoliquiritin Enhanced Glioma Therapy.', 'Anti-inflammation of isoliquiritigenin via the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK in LPS-stimulated MAC-T cells.', 'Pharmacological Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of Licorice-Derived Flavonoids.', 'Autophagy and apoptosis cascade: which is more prominent in neuronal death?', 'Chalcones: Synthetic Chemistry Follows Where Nature Leads.']"""

In this study we investigated the in vitro biosynthesis and downstream metabolism of 11OHP4. Both cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase catalyse the biosynthesis of 11OHP4 from progesterone (P4) which is converted to 11-ketoprogesterone (11KP4) by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, while type 1 readily catalysed the reverse reaction. We showed in HEK-293 cells that these C11-oxy C21 steroids were metabolised by steroidogenic enzymes in the backdoor pathway-5α-reductase (SRD5A) and 3α-hydroxysteroid type 3 (AKR1C2) converted 11OHP4 to 5α-pregnan-11β-ol,3,20-dione and 5α-pregnan-3α,11β-diol-20-one, while 11KP4 was converted to 5α-pregnan-3,11,20-trione and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione (alfaxalone), respectively. Cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase catalysed the hydroxylase and lyase reaction to produce the C11-oxy C19 steroids demonstrated in the conversion of alfaxalone to 11-oxy steroids demonstrated in the conversion of alfaxalone to 11ketoandrosterone. In LNCaP cells, a prostate cancer cell model endogenously expressing the relevant enzymes, 11OHP4 and 11KP4 were metabolised to the potent androgen, 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (11KDHT), thus suggesting the C11-oxy C21 steroids contribute to the pool of validating the in vitro biosynthesis of C11-oxy C19 steroids from C11-oxy C21 steroids. The in vitro reduction of 11KP4 at C3 and C5 by AKR1C2 and SRD5A has confirmed the metabolic route of the urinary metabolite, 3α,20α-dihydroxy-5β-pregnan-11-one. Although our assays have demonstrated the conversion of 11OHP4 and 11KP4 by steroidogenic enzymes in the backdoor pathway yielding 11KDHT, thus suggesting the C11-oxy C21 steroids contribute to the pool of potent androgens, the in vivo confirmation of this metabolic route remains challenging.""","""['Desmaré van Rooyen', 'Rachelle Gent', 'Lise Barnard', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['CYP17A1 exhibits 17αhydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity towards 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone metabolites in the C11-oxy backdoor pathway.', '11α-Hydroxyprogesterone, a potent 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, is metabolised by steroid-5α-reductase and cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase to produce C11α-derivatives of 21-deoxycortisol and 11-hydroxyandrostenedione in vitro.', 'Adrenal C11-oxy C21 steroids contribute to the C11-oxy C19 steroid pool via the backdoor pathway in the biosynthesis and metabolism of 21-deoxycortisol and 21-deoxycortisone.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', 'Turning the spotlight on the C11-oxy androgens in human fetal development.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of human adrenal cytochrome P450 11B2 products of progesterone and androstenedione oxidation.', '11-Oxygenated C19 Steroids Do Not Distinguish the Hyperandrogenic Phenotype of PCOS Daughters from Girls with Obesity.', 'Implicating androgen excess in propagating metabolic disease in polycystic ovary syndrome.']"""

This has never been reported as UPF is usually an insidious sequelae of radiotherapy or energy ablation for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We prospectively identified men who underwent rapid clinical decline due to UPF soon after AUS implantation at our institution in the previous 24 months. Chart and imaging was reviewed to assess preoperative and postoperative factors.  Results:   Three patients were identified. All men had undergone radiation therapy for prostate cancer and all had undergone prior manipulation of the posterior urethra for complications of radiotherapy. Radiation cystitis was present and all had a low cystometric bladder capacity before surgery. All patients declined rapidly after surgery. UPF was diagnosed in 2 men after activation of AUS at 6-7 weeks postoperatively and 1 patient presented before activation at 3 weeks postoperatively. UPF tract was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging in the acute phase in all 3 cases. Two patients have undergone cystectomy and loop diversion with resolution of symptoms and one patient is awaiting definitive surgery.  Conclusion:   Unmasking of occult UPF resulted in rapid clinical decline after AUS implantation. Increased intravesical filling pressure from increased urethral resistance likely resulted in opening of occult fistula tracts.

Ultimately, the AR pathway will be re-activated despite castrate levels of circulating androgens. Thereby, maintaining its role even in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The recent STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials showed that docetaxel in combination with ADT increased survival in hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, suggesting cross-talk between AR signaling and chemotherapy efficacy. We hypothesized that a similar interaction may also apply for CRPC that is treated with cabazitaxel. We studied the impact of androgen status on the efficacy, pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of cabazitaxel in a unique and clinically relevant patient derived xenograft model of castration resistant disease. We found that cabazitaxel is highly effective in a castrate setting with strongly reduced AR activation, while tumor growth inhibition by cabazitaxel was completely abolished in the presence of high AR pathway activity. Moreover, additional experiments showed that intratumoral cabazitaxel levels were 3.5 times higher in tumors from castrated mice as compared to tumors from androgen-supplemented animals. We confirmed that cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics were not affected by testosterone, suggesting that androgen status might influence cabazitaxel tumor uptake directly.

However, patients with unfavorable intermediate risk (UIR) disease are often recommended trimodality therapy involving BT, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). We sought to investigate the relative benefit of supplemental therapies (ADT and/or EBRT) for FIR and UIR prostate cancer in a large dataset.  Materials/methods:   We identified 3,723 patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with BT between 1997 and 2013, including 1,989 and 1,734 patients with FIR and UIR disease, respectively. For the FIR cohort, Fine and Gray's competing risks regression model was used to evaluate whether there was a difference in prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM) between BT vs. BT + supplemental therapy (ADT, EBRT, or both). For the UIR cohort, this regression model was used to evaluate whether supplemental ADT, EBRT, or both decreased PCSM beyond BT alone. Both regression models were adjusted for clinical and treatment-related factors.  Results:   The median follow-up periods were 7.7 years (interquartile range: 5.4-10.5) for the FIR cohort and 7.8 years (interquartile range: 5.3-10.6) for the UIR cohort. For the FIR cohort, there was no difference in PCSM between BT monotherapy vs. BT + supplemental therapy (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.70; 95% CI: 0.46-6.29; P = 0.43). For the UIR cohort, supplemental EBRT (AHR = 2.66; 95% CI: 1.12-6.34; P = 0.03), ADT (AHR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.38-2.43; P = 0.93), or both (AHR = 1.46; 95% CI: 0.42-5.01; P = 0.55) were not associated with improved PCSM compared with BT alone.

We present a method for registration of standard clinical T2-weighted MRI (T2W-MRI) and transverse histopathology whole-mount (WM) sections of the prostate.  Methods:   An isotropic volume stack was created from the WM sections using 2D rigid and deformable registration combined with linear interpolation. The prostate was segmented manually from the T2W-MRI volume and registered to the WM section volume using a combination of affine and deformable registration. The method was evaluated on a set of 12 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Registration accuracy was assessed using volume overlap (Dice Coefficient, DC) and landmark distances.  Results:   The DC was 0.94 for the whole prostate, 0.63 for the peripheral zone and 0.77 for the remaining gland. The landmark distances were on average 5.4 mm.

Materials and methods:   Dose distributions on a single transverse slice of ten prostate cancer treatment plans were presented to eight decision makers. Their eye movements and fixations were recorded with an EyeLink1000 remote eye-tracker. Total evaluation time, dwell time, number and duration of fixations on pre-segmented areas of interest were measured.  Results:   The main structures receiving more and longer fixations (PTV, rectum, bladder) correspond to the main trade-offs evaluated in a typical prostate plan. Radiation oncologists made more fixations on the main structures compared to the medical physicists. Radiation oncologists fixated longer on the rectum when visited for the first time, while medical physicists fixated longer on the bladder.

In clinical trials, adoptive transfer of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells has been shown to be safe and does not require preconditioning.

PTA stimulated the expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 cells to purities up to 99%. These levels were consistently higher than those observed after expansion with zoledronic acid, the most commonly used stimulator for clinical trials. Cell numbers also averaged more than those obtained with zoledronic acid and the expanded Vγ2Vδ2 cells exhibited high cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The high purity of Vγ2Vδ2 cells expanded by PTA increased engraftment success in immunodeficient NOG mice. Even low levels of contaminating αβ T cells resulted in some mice with circulating human αβ T cells rather than Vγ2Vδ2 cells. Vγ2Vδ2 cells from engrafted NOG mice upregulated CD25 and secreted tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ in response to PTA-treated tumor cells. Thus, PTA expands Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to higher purity than zoledronic acid.

The migration of LNCaP cells significantly increased when co-cultured with bone stromal cells isolated from prostate cancer bone metastases. Cytokine array analysis of conditioned medium from bone stromal cell cultures identified CCL5 as a concentration-dependent promoter of LNCaP cell migration. The migration of LNCaP cells was suppressed when C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5) neutralizing antibody was added to cocultures with bone stromal cells. Knockdown of androgen receptor with small interfering RNA increased the migration of LNCaP cells compared with control cells, and CCL5 did not promote the migration of androgen receptor knockdown LNCaP. Elevated CCL5 secretion in bone stromal cells from metastatic lesions induced prostate cancer cell migration by a mechanism consistent with CCL5 activity upstream of androgen receptor signaling.""","""['Satoko Urata', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Kaoru Hiratsuka', 'Aerken Maolake', 'Ariunbold Natsagdorj', 'Kazuyoshi Shigehara', 'Hiroaki Iwamoto', 'Suguru Kadomoto', 'Tomoyuki Makino', 'Renato Naito', 'Yoshifumi Kadono', 'Wen-Jye Lin', 'Guzailinuer Wufuer', 'Kazutaka Narimoto', 'Atsushi Mizokami']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['CCL5/CCR5 axis induces vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated tumor angiogenesis in human osteosarcoma microenvironment.', 'Infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells increase prostate cancer stem cell population and metastatic ability via secreting cytokines to suppress androgen receptor signaling.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'Interactions between cancer cells and bone microenvironment promote bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'Suppression of androgen receptor signaling induces prostate cancer migration via activation of the CCL20-CCR6 axis.', 'Intercellular signaling between ameloblastoma and osteoblasts.', 'Diversity of Vascular Niches in Bones and Joints During Homeostasis, Ageing, and Diseases.']"""

The current study aims to explore the possible role of pituitary tumor transforming gene1 (PTTG1) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Initially, we found that PTTG1 expression was significantly increased in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and CRPC specimens compared with that in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and initial prostate cancer specimens. PTTG1 overexpression significantly enhanced the cell survival rate, clonality and tumorigenicity in LNCaP cells upon androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). While knockdown of PTTG1 expression significantly elevated the sensitivity of DU145 cells to ADT. The effects of PTTG1 overexpression on LNCaP cells may be ascribed to the induced EMT and increased CD44+ CD24- cancer stem cell population. Furthermore, we detected that PTTG1 expression was regulated by interleukin-6 via activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) directly binding to the region -500 to +1 of PTTG1 promoter in LNCaP cells. In conclusion, our results elucidate that interleukin-6/STAT3 activation can increase PTTG1 expression and, consequently, promote the resistance to ADT in CRPC by inducing EMT and increasing the cancer stem cell population, suggesting that PTTG1 may be a novel therapeutic target for CRPC.""","""['Shengquan Huang', 'Qian Liu', 'Qianjin Liao', 'Qingjian Wu', 'Bishao Sun', 'Zhenxing Yang', 'Xiaoyan Hu', 'Mingjia Tan', 'Longkun Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['The lncRNA PTTG3P promotes the progression of CRPC via upregulating PTTG1.', 'Downregulation of PTTG1 expression inhibits the proliferation and invasiveness and promotes the apoptosis of human prostate cancer LNCaP-AI cells.', 'Interleukin-6 induced overexpression of valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is associated with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) progression.', 'MicroRNAs and drug resistance in prostate cancers.', 'Contributions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells to the development of castration resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human chordomas.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

The purpose of this study was to test whether urinary, sexual and bowel functions contribute to emotional distress during the first 2 years after treatment and whether distress may in turn decrease function.  Materials and methods:   The study participants were 1,148 men diagnosed with clinically localized disease who were treated with surgery (63%) or radiotherapy (37%). Urinary, sexual and bowel functions were assessed with EPIC (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). Emotional distress was assessed with the NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) Distress Thermometer. Assessment time points were before treatment, and 6 weeks, and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. We used time lagged multilevel models to test whether physical function predicted emotional distress and vice versa.  Results:   Men with worse urinary, bowel and sexual functions reported more emotional distress than others at subsequent time points. The relationships were bidirectional. Men who reported worse distress also reported worse urinary, bowel and sexual functions at subsequent time points.  Conclusions:   Clinicians supported by practice and payer policies should screen for and facilitate the treatment of side effects and heightened emotional distress to improve well-being in survivors of prostate cancer.

While recent population based studies demonstrated a stable incidence of locoregional prostate cancer, they categorized organ confined, extraprostatic and lymph node positive disease together. However, to our knowledge the contemporary incidence of prostate cancer with pelvic lymph node metastases remains unknown.  Materials and methods:   We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) data from 2004 to 2014 to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer. We analyzed trends in the age standardized prostate cancer incidence by stage. The impact of disease extent on mortality was assessed by adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis.  Results:   During the study period the annual incidence of nonmetastatic prostate cancer decreased from 5,119.1 to 2,931.9 per million men (IR 0.57, 95% CI 0.56-0.58, p <0.01) while the incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases increased from 54.1 to 79.5 per million men (IR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.62, p <0.01). The incidence of distant metastases in men 75 years old or older reached a nadir in 2011 compared to 2004 (IR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90, p <0.01) and it increased in 2012 compared to 2011 (IR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, p <0.05). The risk of cancer specific mortality significantly increased in men diagnosed with pelvic lymph node metastases (HR 4.5, 95% CI 4.2-4.9, p <0.01) and distant metastases (HR 21.9, 95% CI 21.2-22.7, p <0.01) compared to men with nonmetastatic disease.  Conclusions:   The incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases is increasing coincident with a decline in the detection of localized disease. Whether this portends an increase in the burden of advanced disease or simply reflects decreased lead time remains unclear.

With 85% of patients with thyroid cancer surviving for ten years or longer it is increasingly important to study the quality of life in these patients and identify which aspects of the patients' health and wellbeing could be improved.  Methods:   During the first UK patient-doctor thyroid cancer forum, patient attendees filled in an anonymized questionnaire. Patients with a diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer were studied, and patients less than 6 months from diagnosis were excluded. The questionnaire included demographic data, the EQ-5D-3L validated tool, information on post-operative outcomes; scar satisfaction, use of calcium supplements >6months post-operatively, vocal cord palsy, anti-depressant use and psychological counselling.  Results:   82 completed questionnaires were used for the study. The median age at diagnosis was 42 years (range 18-72), and there was a female:male ratio of 6:1. EQ-5D utility health scores: the mean weighted health outcome of the average population in the UK is 0.86 (SD 0.23).

As urine cytology is not sensitive enough, patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer need lifelong follow-up involving multiple invasive cystoscopies. Our aims of study were to examine the expression of semaphorin 3A in urothelial cancer patients and to evaluate semaphorin 3A as a potential marker for urothelial cancer.  Materials and methods:   Urine samples were taken from patients with known bladder tumor, hospitalized for transurethral resection of lesions, from patients with history of urothelial cancer admitted for endoscopic follow up, from patients with other nonmalignant urological conditions such as prostatic hyperplasia, stress incontinence, urethral stricture, ureteral and kidney stones, and from healthy volunteers with no history of urothelial malignancy and no urological symptoms. Semaphorin 3A (sema3A) protein level was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in every sample and levels were correlated with endoscopic and pathological findings. In addition, we performed immunohistochemically staining with semaphorin 3A of 15 tissue samples (various tumors and normal bladder tissues).  Results:   A total of 183 urine samples were tested. Out of them, 116 patients (mean age 70.7; 94 males and 22 females) had positive cystoscopy, and 67 (mean age 64.7; 51 males and 16 females) had negative cystoscopy. Higher sema3A values were significantly correlated (P = 0.006) with presence of urothelial cancer, as determined by positive cystoscopy or urethroscopy and pathological biopsy. Sema3A levels also showed positive correlation with the number of tumors. Sema3A levels combined with urine cytology showed much higher sensitivity compared with cytology alone (66% vs. 33%), with smaller reduction of specificity (77% vs. 90%). Immunohistochemical staining showed intense staining in high stage and grade tumors, and almost no staining in normal tissue.  Conclusions:   Semaphorin 3A is overexpressed in urothelial cancer patients, as evidenced both in its presence in urine and in bladder tissue. Semaphorin 3A in urine is a promising potential urothelial cancer biomarker either independently or in conjunction with cytology.

We compared biopsy events (i.e., unique biopsies) in the era of empiric prophylaxis to those in the era of targeted prophylaxis based on culture. The effect of fluoroquinolone resistant organisms (FQ-R), and other demographic and clinical factors, on hospitalization was assessed using logistic regression.  Results:   Of 1,167 men on active surveillance, 825 responded for a total of 3,361 biopsy events; 7 (0.79%) of 886 biopsies preceded by rectal swab culture resulted in hospitalization compared to 24 (0.97%) of 2,475 biopsies without culture (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.35-1.89, P = 0.63). Among 886 cultures performed, FQ-R organisms were identified in 194 (21.9%); 6 out of 194 (3.1%) biopsies with swabs positive for FQ-R resulted in admission compared to 1 out of 692 (0.14%) biopsies with fluoroquinolone sensitive swabs (OR = 22.1, 95% CI: 2.6-184.3, P<0.01). Smaller prostate volume at diagnosis was significantly associated with hospitalization (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04-6.31) for<45 g vs. ≥45 g, P = 0.039).  Conclusion:   Targeted antibiotic prophylaxis is not associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization for suspected post-TRUSP biopsy sepsis.

Materials and methods:   Records of 6,041 patients who were treated with RP between 2000 and 2011 for clinically nonmetastatic PCa were, retrospectively, analyzed from prospectively collected datasets. BCR-free survival rates were assessed using univariable and multivariable cox-regression analyses.  Results:   Median patient age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 57-66) with a median preoperative prostrate specific antigen of 6ng/ml (IQR: 4-9). Overall, 28% of patients had Gleason score (GS) 6, 0.3% GS 6 + TGP, 33% GS 7 (3 + 4), 0.2% GS 7 (3 + 4) + TGP, 22% GS 7 (4 + 3), 0.2% GS 7 (4 + 3) + TGP, 0.1% GS 8 and 0.4% GS 9 or 10. Median follow-up was 45 months (IQR: 31-57). Harboring a TGP was associated with higher rates of positive surgical margins, lymphovascular invasion, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion than their counterparts within the same GS group as well as in the next higher GS group (all P ≤ 0.05). At 5 years post-RP, BCR estimates were 5% for patients with GS 6, 13% for patients with GS 6 + TGP, 6% for patients with GS 7 (3 + 4), 22% for patients with GS 7 (3 + 4) + TGP, 16% for patients with GS 7 (4 + 3), 41% for patients with GS 7 (4 + 3) + TGP, 38% for patients with GS 8 (4 + 4) and 46% for patients with GS 9 or 10. Patients harboring a TGP had higher BCR rates than the patients in the next higher GS group: GS 6 + TGP vs. GS 7 (3 + 4), HR = 1.6, P = 0.02 and GS 7 (3 + 4)+TGP vs. GS 7 (4 + 3), HR = 1.4, P = 0.03. Patients with a TGP in the GS 7 (4 + 3) group had comparable BCR rates as patients with GS = 8 (P = 0.4) and GS 9 to 10 (P = 0.2). On multivariable analysis that adjusted for the effects of preoperative prostrate specific antigen, nodal involvement, positive surgical margin, extraprostatic disease (pT3a), seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) and different institution, harboring a TGP showed higher risk of developing BCR within the same GS group and comparable risk of developing BCR with the next higher GS group.  Conclusion:   Patients with TGP at RP have adverse clinicopathological features when compared to their counterparts in the same and the next higher GS group without TGP. Risk of developing BCR increases with the presence of TGP within the same GS group. This risk seems to be comparable between patients with TGP and their counterparts in the next higher GS group without TGP.

This work investigates the feasibility of switching patients to different accelerators for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of photon beams from different Linac models and vendors. Prostate and head and neck (H&N) treatment plans for Siemens Primus, Primart, and Varian 21EX accelerators are studied in this work. Dose distributions for given plans are recalculated using different beam data with the same nominal energy from different Linacs. We have compared dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and the maximum, the minimum, and the mean doses to the target and critical structures because of switching accelerators. In the process of switching a treatment plan to a different accelerator, issues exist, including optimum penumbra compensation, dose distribution at the boundary of target and critical structures, and multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf-width effects, which need to be considered and verified with measurements. Our Monte Carlo simulation results confirm that, for the cases we tested, the dose received by 95% of the planning target volume differs by 0.2% to 1.5% between Siemens Primus and Varian 21EX Linacs. The discrepancy is within our clinical acceptance criteria of 3% for IMRT treatments. In making the final decision on whether to switch machines or not, the tumor control probabilities (TCPs) based on a linear-quadratic model are compared. Based on the analyses performed in this work, it is therapeutically more beneficial to switch a patient to a different machine than to postpone a treatment until the original machine is available, especially for fast-growing tumors such as H&N cancers.""","""['Teh Lin', 'Murshed Hossain', 'Jiajin Fan', 'C-M Charlie Ma']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['SU-E-T-483: Delay Treatment or Switch to Different Machines?

Methods: Data was collected via telephone interviews conducted by trained interviewers in 2001 (231 females and 207 males, 64% response rate) and 2014/5 (588 females and 476 males, 64% response rate). Participants were asked to identify the most common three causes of cancer mortality among women and then men. They were also asked to note their agreement or otherwise with statements about early detection and treatment of cancer. Results: There was an increase in proportions of men who correctly identified prostate cancer as one of the top three causes of cancer mortality among men, and also an increase among women who correctly identified bowel cancer as one of the top three. Most participants agreed that there were benefits from early detection for cancer outcomes. Over time, there was a significant decline in proportions which felt that most cancer treatment is “so terrible it is worse than death” and that alternative therapy has an “equal or better chance of curing cancer.” Conclusion: Internationally, there is little information available about changes in cancer perceptions over time, these findings suggest some changes in perceptions of treatment and awareness of types of cancer with the highest mortality in NZ, which should support timely engagement with early detection and treatment services.""","""['Rosalina Richards', 'Bronwen McNoe', 'Ella Iosua', 'Anthony I Reeder', 'Richard Egan', 'Louise Marsh', 'Lindsay Robertson', 'Brett Maclennan', 'Anna Tiatia Faatoese Latu', 'Robin Quigg', 'Anne-Cathrine Petersen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Perceptions of New Zealand adults about complementary and alternative therapies for cancer treatment.', 'Cancer Information Seeking Among Adult New Zealanders: a National Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Declining Bowel Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Germany.', 'The importance of early symptom recognition in the context of early detection and cancer survival.']"""

Because of its high recurrence rate, ICC has a poor prognosis even after complete tumor resection. Compared with normal differentiated cells, cancer cells have an altered metabolism for supporting their survival in severe conditions. Cancer cells acquire additional malignant potential as a result of this metabolic alteration. Thus, the molecules known to be involved in cancer metabolism, could be novel therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a recently discovered pyruvate transporter, which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Although MPC is composed of two subunits, it has been reported that the MPC1 subunit is specifically associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including colorectal and prostate cancer. However, only a few studies have assessed the clinical significance of MPC1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying its influence on cancer progression are not well understood. This study aimed to clarify the function of MPC1 that affects the malignant potential of ICC. The expression of MPC1 in ICC clinical specimens was determined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the correlations between MPC1 expression and the survival rate, as well as various clinicopathological parameters were assessed. Low MPC1 expression correlated with poor ICC prognosis and was correlated with tumor invasion and distant metastasis. Both these phenomena are closely associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, we investigated the impact of altering the MPC1 gene expression on the malignant potential of cancer cells using biliary tract cancer cell lines in vitro. The expression of MPC1 was downregulated in the cells induced to undergo EMT following treatment with TGF-β. Furthermore, the inhibition of MPC1 expression induced EMT in cancer cells, and the overexpression of MPC1 suppressed the migration of tumor cells. These results indicated that MPC1 could be a novel therapeutic target in some cancers.""","""['Tomofumi Ohashi', 'Hidetoshi Eguchi', 'Koichi Kawamoto', 'Masamitsu Konno', 'Ayumu Asai', 'Hugh Colvin', 'Yuji Ueda', 'Hirofumi Takaoka', 'Yoshifumi Iwagami', 'Daisaku Yamada', 'Tadafumi Asaoka', 'Takehiro Noda', 'Hiroshi Wada', 'Kunihito Gotoh', 'Shogo Kobayashi', 'Jun Koseki', 'Taroh Satoh', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa', 'Yuichiro Doki', 'Masaki Mori', 'Hideshi Ishii']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and its clinical implications.', 'Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A1 promotes proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'CD90 expression in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis.', 'miRNA profiling for diagnosis, prognosis and stratification of cancer treatment in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Multiple cellular origins and molecular evolution of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'The novel epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins and their therapeutic targets in cholangiocarcinoma: a narrative review.', 'The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier at the crossroads of intermediary metabolism.', 'Oxygen and metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment influences metastasis homing.', 'Genetic Mutations and Non-Coding RNA-Based Epigenetic Alterations Mediating the Warburg Effect in Colorectal Carcinogenesis.', 'Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1: a novel prognostic biomarker that predicts favourable patient survival in cancer.']"""

It is significant to understand the mechanisms underlying liver cancer for diagnosis and treatment. Cumulative evidence suggests that the abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) may contribute to the development and metastasis of cancer. miR‑124a acts as a tumour suppressor in osteosarcoma, endometrial carcinoma, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. However, the effects of miR‑124a in liver cancer and its biological mechanism are not fully understood. It has been demonstrated that miR‑124a is downregulated and interleukin (IL)‑11 is upregulated in the liver cancer tissues. In the present study, miR‑124a upregulation inhibited cell proliferation, migration and promoted cell apoptosis. Through a dual‑luciferase reporter assay, it was verified that IL‑11 is a direct target of miR‑124a. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR‑124a repressed the secretion of IL‑11 from hepatoma cells. Finally, it was identified that mimics of miR‑124a increased the expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase‑2 (TIMP‑2) and Caspase‑3 and decreased the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, B‑cell lymphoma 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphorylated‑STAT3. In conclusion, the results indicated that miR‑124a has an important role as a tumour suppressor gene by targeting IL‑11.

First, the selection-free AccuCyte® - CyteFinder® system (RareCyte® , Inc., Seattle, WA) and second, the ISET system (Rarecells Diagnostics, France), a CTC detection method based on cell size-exclusion.  Methods:   Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 15 patients with metastatic PCa and processed in parallel, using both methods according to manufacturer's protocol. CTCs were identified by immunofluorescence, using commercially available antibodies to pancytokeratin (PanCK), EpCAM, CD45/CD66b/CD34/CD11b/CD14 (AccuCyte® - CyteFinder® system), and pancytokeratin, vimentin (Vim) and CD45 (ISET system).  Results:   The median CTC count was 5 CTCs/7.5 mL (range, 0-20) for the AccuCyte® - CyteFinder® system and 37 CTCs/7.5 mL (range, 8-139) for the ISET system (P < 0.001).

When separating the total CTC count obtained with the ISET system in PanCK+/Vim- and PanCK+/Vim+ CTCs, the total CTC count obtained with the AccuCyte® - CyteFinder® system was moderately correlated with the PanCK+/Vim- CTCs, and strongly correlated with the PanCK+/Vim+ CTCs (r = 0.700, P = 0.004 and r = 0.810, P < 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion:   Our results highlight significant disparities in the enumeration and phenotype of CTCs detected by both techniques. Although the median amount of CTCs/7.5 mL differed significantly, total CTC counts of both methods were strongly correlated. For future studies, a more uniform approach to the isolation and definition of CTCs based on immunofluorescent stains is needed to provide reproducible results that can be correlated with clinical outcomes.""","""['Emma E van der Toom', 'Vincent P Groot', 'Stephanie A Glavaris', 'Georgios Gemenetzis', 'Heather J Chalfin', 'Laura D Wood', 'Christopher L Wolfgang', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Characterization of Urothelial Cancer Circulating Tumor Cells with a Novel Selection-Free Method.', 'Nucleolin Staining May Aid in the Identification of Circulating Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The combination of size-based separation and selection-free technology provides higher circulating tumour cells detection sensitivity than either method alone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Technical challenges in the isolation and analysis of circulating tumor cells.', 'Phenotype of circulating tumor cell: face-off between epithelial and mesenchymal masks.', 'ALCAM: A Novel Surface Marker on EpCAMlow Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Detection of circulating tumor cells: opportunities and challenges.', 'Transcriptomic profiling of single circulating tumor cells provides insight into human metastatic gastric cancer.', 'Current methodologies to detect circulating tumor cells: a focus on ovarian cancer.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Blood-based Liquid Biopsies to Inform Clinical Decision-making in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed mCRPC patients treated with sequential therapy using DP followed by AA or vice versa. Patients who had received enzalutamide or cabazitaxel were excluded. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS). The combined PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), combined radiographic PFS (rPFS), and OS of AA-to-DP were compared to the reverse sequence using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank statistics. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors that were associated with combined PSA-PFS, combined rPFS and OS.  Results:   A total of 104 mCRPC patients who began treatment between 2013 and 2017 were identified: 42 were in the DP-to-AA group and 62 were in the AA-to-DP group. There was no significant difference of baseline clinical characteristics between AA-to-DP and DP-to-AA group. In addition, there was no significant difference in combined PSA-PFS (AA-to-DP: 12.5 [11.4-13.6] vs DP-to-AA: 13.2 [10.9-15.5] months [P = 0.127]), combined rPFS (AA-to-DP: 12.2 [10.9-13.4] vs DP-to-AA: 11.2 [8.9-13.5] months [P = 0.183]) and OS (AA-to-DP: 23.3 [19.7-26.9] vs DP-to-AA: 22.9 [22.1-23.7] months [P = 0.213]) between the two treatment sequences in Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Bearing in mind how changes in tALP did not meet statistical requirements as surrogate marker for survival, aim of this single-center retrospective study was to characterize the prognostic and predictive role of baseline clinical variables associated with overall survival in patients receiving 223Ra treatment.  Methods:   92 consecutive CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases receiving 223Ra treatment were included. Available baseline clinical data relevant to the survival analysis were retrospectively collected. The primary end-point of the study was overall survival, which was established from the first 223Ra administration until date of death from any cause.  Results:   Median follow-up time from the first 223Ra administration was 6 months (range 1-31 months). The univariate analysis evaluating the prognostic value of all baseline clinical variables showed that patients' weight, BMI, ECOG PS, Hb and tALP values were independently associated with OS. On multivariable analysis only baseline Hb value and ECOG PS remained significantly correlated with OS. To determine reliable baseline predictive factors for survival in patients receiving 223Ra treatment, we produced a predictive score. We tried all possible variable combinations, and found that the best score was obtained by combining baseline ECOG PS with Hb < 12 g/dl and PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml. This resulted in a score ranging from 0 to 4, with AUC 78.4% (p < 0.001).

Nonetheless, the actual impact of IDSs on outcomes for complex multidisciplinary care such as major cancer surgery is largely unknown.  Methods:   Using 2011-2013 Medicare data, this study identified patients who underwent surgical resection for prostate, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, lung, liver, kidney, colorectal, or ovarian cancer. Rates of readmission, 30-day mortality, surgical complications, failure to rescue, and prolonged hospital stay for cancer surgery were compared between patients receiving care at IDS hospitals and those receiving care at non-IDS hospitals. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust results by cancer type and patient- and hospital-level characteristics while accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals.  Results:   The study identified 380,053 patients who underwent major resection of cancer, with 38% receiving care at an IDS. Outcomes did not differ between IDS and non-IDS hospitals regarding readmission and surgical complication rates, whereas only minor differences were observed for 30-day mortality (3.5% vs 3.2% for IDS; p < 0.001) and prolonged hospital stay (9.9% vs 9.2% for IDS; p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the frequencies of adverse perioperative outcomes were not significantly associated with IDS status.  Conclusions:   The collective findings suggest that local delivery system integration alone does not necessarily have an impact on perioperative outcomes in surgical oncology. Moving forward, stakeholders may need to focus on surgical and oncology-specific methods of care coordination and quality improvement initiatives to improve outcomes for patients undergoing cancer surgery.""","""['Jonathan Li', 'Zaojun Ye', 'James M Dupree', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'Hye Sung Min', 'Deborah Kaye', 'Lindsey A Herrel', 'David C Miller', 'Chad Ellimoottil']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Early impact of Medicare accountable care organizations on cancer surgery outcomes.', ""Understanding the relationship between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare star rating, surgical case volume, and short-term outcomes after major cancer surgery."", 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.', 'Hospital characteristics, clinical severity, and outcomes for surgical oncology patients.', 'Is cancer care best at high-volume providers?']"""

Some studies have reported inconclusive findings regarding chromosomal aberrations in the ADAM9-containing region and ADAM9 expression in oral cancer. Therefore, in this study, ADAM9 protein expression was determined and compared between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and normal oral tissues, and between oral cancer cell lines and human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). In total, 34 OSCC and 10 healthy paraffin-embedded tissue sections were probed with an anti-ADAM9 antibody, and the immunohistochemical score was determined by multiplying the percentage of positively stained cells with the intensity score. Four different oral cancer and eight independent HOK cell lines were cultured, and the expression of membrane ADAM9 and active ADAM9 at 84 kDa in these cell lines was assayed by flow cytometry and western blot hybridization, respectively. The results showed that the median immunohistochemical score of ADAM9 expression in OSCC tissues was significantly greater than that in normal tissues (P<0.001). Furthermore, among OSCC cases, intense staining of ADAM9 expression was detected in well-differentiated and in moderately-differentiated OSCC; ADAM9 expression was also correlated with an increased degree of cell differentiation (r=0.557; P=0.001). Expression of membrane ADAM9 was present in 3/4 cancer cell lines. Expression of active ADAM9 varied among all the tested cell lines, but significantly higher ADAM9 expression was present in certain cancer cell lines than those in HOKs (P<0.05). In summary, ADAM9 expression is enhanced in OSCC and oral cancer cell lines, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of oral cancer.

The mouse model of prostate-specific probasin-mediated Pten deletion leads to prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) leading to adenocarcinoma. Using this model, we analysed the miR and mRNA transcriptome profile of Pten -/- PIN versus wild type age-matched prostate tissues and analysed the effects of Pten loss on miR expression in the early neoplastic process. At the PIN stage, Pten loss significantly changed the expression of over 20 miRNAs and over 4000 genes. The observed miR expression indicated a strong immunological cohort, which is seen in many human and mouse cancers and is thought to derive from infiltrating B and T immune cells. However, upon in situ hybridisation, these immunologically related miRs did not correlate with immune cell location, and emanated from the prostate epithelium itself and not from the associated immune cells present. Growing Pten -/- prostate cells in culture showed that the overexpressed miRNAs seen in Pten -/- were directly in response to the overactive PI3 kinase pathway and were in part responsible in reducing target gene expression levels. Inhibition of PI3 kinase downstream regulators, or re-introducing wild type Pten cDNA reduced miR overexpression resulting in increased miR target gene expression. MiR inhibitors also showed this pattern, and synergised with an mTORC1 inhibitor. Overall, Pten deletion in the prostate epithelium activated a cohort of inflammation-related miRs usually associated with immune responses from B and T cells. These oncomiRs may then accelerate carcinogenesis.""","""['D Alwyn Dart', 'Pinar Uysal-Onganer', 'W G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['Cooperation between FGF8b overexpression and PTEN deficiency in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Resveratrol and pterostilbene epigenetically restore PTEN expression by targeting oncomiRs of the miR-17 family in prostate cancer.', 'In\xa0Vivo Expression of miR-32 Induces Proliferation in Prostate Epithelium.', 'Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Intact and Castrated PTEN Knockout Mice via Targeting PKCε, Stat3, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Markers.', 'Orchestration of miRNA Patterns by Testosterone and Dietary Tomato Carotenoids during Early Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice.', 'Multiple tissue-specific epigenetic alterations regulate persistent gene expression changes following developmental DES exposure in mouse reproductive tissues.', 'miRNA Pattern in Hypoxic Microenvironment of Kidney Cancer-Role of PTEN.', 'Expression of miR-24-1-5p in Tumor Tissue Influences Prostate Cancer Recurrence: The PROCA-life Study.', 'Prostate Cancer Cell Extracellular Vesicles Increase Mineralisation of Bone Osteoblast Precursor Cells in an In Vitro Model.']"""

Here, we use Medicare administrative data to examine the association between NaF PET results and hospice claims within 180 d and 1-y survival. Methods: We classified NOPR NaF PET results linked to Medicare claims by imaging indication (initial staging [IS]; detection of suspected first osseous metastasis [FOM]; suspected progression of osseous metastasis [POM]; or treatment monitoring [TM]) and type of cancer (prostate, lung, breast, or other). Results were classified as definitely positive scan findings versus probably positive scan findings versus negative scan findings for osseous metastasis for IS and FOM; more extensive disease versus no change or less extensive disease for POM; and worse prognosis versus no change or better prognosis for TM, based on the postscan assessment. Our study included 21,167 scans obtained from 2011 to 2014 of consenting NOPR participants aged 65 y or older. Results: The relative risk of hospice claims within 180 d of a NaF PET scan was 2.0-7.5 times higher for patients with evidence of new or progressing osseous metastasis than for those without, depending on indication and cancer type (all P < 0.008). The percentage difference in hospice claims for those with a finding of new or more advanced osseous disease ranged from 3.9% for IS prostate patients to 28% for FOM lung patients. Six-month survival was also associated with evidence of new or increased osseous disease; risk of death was 1.8-5.1 times as likely (all P ≤ 0.0001), with percentage differences of approximately 30% comparing positive and negative scans in patients with lung cancer imaged for IS or FOM. Conclusion: Our analyses demonstrated that NaF PET scan results are highly associated with subsequent hospice claims and, ultimately, with patient survival.

TRUS guided prostate biopsies were performed using BK flex500, with a side-fire biplane probe. Each biopsy core image was captured and clinical data were recorded prospectively. The angle between the expected trajectory of the needle and actual needle course was measured using the longitudinal view of the captured image. The distance between expected and actual needle tip was calculated. We measured median and interquartile needle tip deflection rate stratified by side and location (apex, midgland, base). Univariable and multivariable linear regressions analysis were performed.  Results:   The overall median needle tip deflection was 1.77 mm (IQR 1.35-2.47).

Accuracy varied with data framing: when presented with RRR, respondents were 13% accurate without BR and 31% accurate with BR; when presented with ARR, they were 0% accurate without BR and 35% accurate with BR. Including BR data significantly improved accuracy for both RRR (P = 0.03) and ARR groups (P < 0.01). Accuracy was significantly related to numeracy; numeracy scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were associated with accuracy rates of six, five, nine, and 36 percent, respectively (P < 0.01). Overall, numeracy was significantly associated with the accuracy of interpreting quantitative benefits of PSA screening.

In addition, different antibodies can be introduced to the AuNP surfaced via electrostatic interactions to provide highly specific recognition sites for biomolecular sensing. Moreover, multiple, simultaneous tests can be rapidly performed with low sample consumption by incorporating these surface-modified AuNPs into a paper-based analytical device that can be read using just a smartphone. As a result of these innovations, we were able to achieve a detection limit of 10 pg/mL for a prostate specific antigen in a test that could be completed in as little as 15 min.

Methods:   The lncRNA array was used to screen differentially expressed lncRNAs in PCa and the corresponding carcinoma-adjacent normal tissues from 3 patients. The expressions of LINC01358 in the primary PCa, metastatic PCa, and carcinoma-adjacent tissues were compared using the PCa dataset of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The data obtained were validated by determining the expression of LINC01358 in the PCa and carcinoma-adjacent tissues of another 10 patients by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of lncRNA LINC01358 on the proliferation of DU145 cells and migration of PCa cells were detected by MTT and Transwell assay, respectively.  Results:   Totally, 79 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the lncRNA array, 36 highly and the other 43 lowly expressed in the PCa tissue. LINC01358 was up-regulated in the cancerous tissue. According to the MSKCC data, the LINC01358 expression was markedly higher in metastatic PCa (5.81±0.19, n = 19) and primary PCa (5.47±0.04, n = 131) than in the PCa-adjacent tissue (5.15±0.07, n = 29) and significantly correlated with postoperative biochemical relapse of the malignancy (P<0.05). qRT-PCR indicated a remarkably higher expression of LINC01358 in the PCa than in the carcinoma-adjacent tissue (6.02±1.12 vs 3.21±0.21, P<0.05). Transfection of the DU145 cells with siRNA significantly decreased the level of LINC01358 and inhibited the proliferation and migration of the PCa cells.  Conclusions:   LINC01358 is highly expressed in the PCa tissue and knockdown of LINC01358 may inhibit the proliferation and migration of PCa cells.

Methods:   Real time PCR was used to measure the expression level of miR-132 in the prostate cancer tissue, analyze its relationship with the clinical stage and Gleason score of prostate cancer, and determine the influence of hypoxia on the miR-132 level in the human prostate cancer PC3 cell line in vitro. Sulfor-hodamine B chromatometry and Matrigel invasion assay were employed to detect the effects of hypoxia and miR-132 mimic plasmid transfection on the viability and invasiveness of PC3 cells in vitro.  Results:   The miR-132 level in the prostate cancer was significantly declined to 52.38% (in T1－T2 stages) and 21.59% (in T3－T4 stages) of that in the cancer-adjacent tissue (both P<0.01). In hypoxia, the expression of miR-132 was significantly decreased in the PC3 cells (P<0.01). After 48 and 72 hours of transfection with miR-132 mimic plasmid, the viability of the PC3 cells was markedly reduced (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and their invasiveness decreased by 57.5% after 48 hours (P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the viability or invasiveness of the PC3 cells transfected with miR-132 mimic plasmid between normoxia and hypoxia.  Conclusions:   The reduced expression of miR-132 is closely related to the clinical stage and Gleason score of prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is positively correlated with cholesterol, potentially increasing PSA-driven biopsy recommendations in men with high cholesterol, though biopsy compliance may be lower in men with comorbid conditions. These potential biases may affect PSA-driven biopsy rates and subsequent prostate cancer detection in men with high serum cholesterol. Our objective was to test the association between serum cholesterol and prostate cancer risk in men receiving PSA independent, study-mandated prostate biopsies.  Methods:   We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from 4974 non-statin users in REDUCE, a randomized trial in men with elevated PSA and a negative baseline biopsy. Men underwent 2- and 4-year trial-mandated prostate biopsies. Associations between baseline serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prostate cancer risk, overall and by Gleason grade (<7 vs. ≥7), were examined using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   High total serum cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR per 10 mg/dL 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.09; p = 0.048), but cholesterol was unrelated to either overall or low-grade prostate cancer risk (p-values >0.185). There was no association between serum LDL and overall, low- or high-grade prostate cancer risk (p-values >0.137). In contrast, elevated serum HDL was associated with increased risk of both overall (OR per 10 mg/dL 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16; p = 0.033) and high-grade prostate cancer (OR per 10 mg/dL 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28; p = 0.034).

In both three-dimensional primary prostate cancer cell cultures that are prone to Gravin depletion and Gravin short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-treated cells, an increase in cells containing micronuclei was noted in comparison with controls. To examine whether the loss of Gravin affected PLK1 distribution and activity, we utilized photokinetics and a PLK1 activity biosensor. Gravin depletion resulted in an increased PLK1 mobile fraction, causing the redistribution of active PLK1, which leads to increased defocusing and phosphorylation of the mitotic centrosome protein CEP215 at serine-613. Gravin depletion further led to defects in microtubule renucleation from mitotic centrosomes, decreased kinetochore-fiber integrity, increased incidence of chromosome misalignment, and subsequent formation of micronuclei following mitosis completion. Murine Gravin rescued chromosome misalignment and micronuclei formation, but a mutant Gravin that cannot bind PLK1 did not. These findings suggest that disruption of a Gravin-PLK1 interface leads to inappropriate PLK1 activity contributing to chromosome segregation errors, formation of micronuclei, and subsequent DNA damage.""","""['Erica G Colicino', 'Alice M Garrastegui', 'Judy Freshour', 'Peu Santra', 'Dawn E Post', 'Leszek Kotula', 'Heidi Hehnly']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Biol Cell""","""['Chromosome misalignment is associated with PLK1 activity at cenexin-positive mitotic centrosomes.', 'Sirt1 Regulates Microtubule Dynamics Through Negative Regulation of Plk1 in Mitosis.', 'AIBp regulates mitotic entry and mitotic spindle assembly by controlling activation of both Aurora-A and Plk1.', 'Recent Progress on the Localization of PLK1 to the Kinetochore and Its Role in Mitosis.', 'Aurora-PLK1 cascades as key signaling modules in the regulation of mitosis.', 'Pericentriolar matrix (PCM) integrity relies on cenexin and polo-like kinase (PLK)1.', 'Rab11 endosomes and Pericentrin coordinate centrosome movement during pre-abscission in vivo.', 'Gravin-associated kinase signaling networks coordinate γ-tubulin organization at mitotic spindle poles.', 'Cytokinetic bridge triggers de novo lumen formation in vivo.', 'Mitotic kinase anchoring proteins: the navigators of cell division.']"""

To better understand disease etiology and the mechanisms of disease-risk factor associations, this analysis aimed to investigate the associations of anthropometric, sociodemographic and behavioural factors with a range of circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin.  Methods:   Statistical analyses of individual participant data from 12,330 male controls aged 25-85 years from 25 studies involved in the Endogenous Hormones Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Analysis of variance was used to estimate geometric means adjusted for study and relevant covariates.  Results:   Older age was associated with higher concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin and dihydrotestosterone and lower concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide and free estradiol. Higher body mass index was associated with higher concentrations of free estradiol, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol and estrone and lower concentrations of dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Taller height was associated with lower concentrations of androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin and higher concentrations of androstanediol glucuronide. Current smoking was associated with higher concentrations of androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin and testosterone. Alcohol consumption was associated with higher concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and androstanediol glucuronide.

Methods and materials:   A total of 179 PSMA PET scans in patients with nil or ≤3 lesions on conventional imaging were retrospectively categorized into 3 subgroups: group A, high-risk PC with no prior definitive therapy (n=34); group B, prior prostatectomy (n=75); and group C, prior radiation therapy (n=70). The numbers and locations of the PSMA-avid lesions were mapped. The PSMA-positive lesions were identified subjectively by a nuclear medicine physician on the basis of clinical experience and taking into account the recent literature and artefacts.  Results:   A total of 893 PSMA-avid lesions were identified; at least 1 lesion was detected in 80% of all scans. A high detection rate was present even at very low serum PSA levels (eg, at PSA ≤0.20 ng/mL in group B, the detection rate was 46%). Thirty-eight percent of studies revealed extrapelvic disease (41%, 31%, and 46% in groups A, B, and C, respectively). Almost one-third of all studies showed only oligometastases (24%, 36%, and 31% in groups A, B, and C, respectively). A large proportion of these (40%) were a solitary lesion.  Conclusions:   Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET demonstrated a large number of otherwise unknown metastatic lesions. Therefore we recommend PSMA PET for more accurate assessment of disease burden in initial staging of high-risk PC, as well as for restaging in patients with prostate-specific antigen relapse after primary therapies. Furthermore, a high proportion of oligometastases on PSMA PET provides a prime opportunity to investigate the role of targeted local therapies for oligometastatic PCs.""","""['Sandeep K Gupta', 'Tahne Watson', 'Jim Denham', 'Thomas P Shakespeare', 'Natalie Rutherford', 'Nicholas McLeod', 'Kevin Picton', 'Paul Ainsworth', 'Tony Bonaventura', 'Jarad M Martin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A Multicenter Prospective Clinical Trial of 68Gallium PSMA HBED-CC PET-CT Restaging in Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Carcinoma: Oligometastatic Rate and Distribution Compared With Standard Imaging.', 'Efficacy, Predictive Factors, and Prediction Nomograms for 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-ligand Positron-emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Early Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Oligometastases in prostate cancer : Metabolic response in follow-up PSMA-PET-CTs after hypofractionated IGRT.', ""Metastatic Sites' Location and Impact on Patient Management After the Introduction of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Newly Diagnosed and Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Critical Review."", 'The role of PSMA PET-CT in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-PET/CT-guided salvage radiotherapy in recurrent or persistent prostate cancer and PSA\u2009<\u20090.2\xa0ng/ml.', 'Detection Efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Very Low PSA Levels: A 7-Year, Two-Center ""Real-World"" Experience.', 'What is the ideal combination therapy in de novo, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer?', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in early relapsed prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'Role of PSMA PET-guided metastases-directed therapy in oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Logistic regression was used to assess associations between identified factor scores and colorectal adenoma (CRA) in sex-specific subgroups.  Results:   Three diet patterns were observed in this cohort: 'Fruits and vegetables', 'Western' and 'Sweet and salty'. Foods that loaded on each factor were similar between the racial subgroups.

Assessment of pain with standardized questionnaires reduces variability in its interpretation and may increase effectiveness of medical interventions. Prostate cancer is the most frequent male neoplasm in Portugal. We designed this study to evaluate the impact of a standardized pain questionnaire on pain management in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Single centre prospective observational study of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The study was designed to evaluate the benefit of systematically evaluating pain with Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form prior to a scheduled medical oncology consult. Patients reporting pain were reassessed one week later by telephone. To assess the benefit two consecutive cohorts were established based on communication of questionnaire results to the treating physician.  Results:   We recruited 207 patients of which 60% reported pain. Statistically significant decrease in mean pain intensity one week after the scheduled appointment was noted (3.95 vs 3.01; p < 0.001). Patients whose Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was provided to their oncologist experienced greater reduction in pain, which was non-significant (p = 0.227). Using Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form assessment resulted in a higher probability of pain control (43.5% vs 30.9%; p = 0.193).  Discussion:   The prevalence of pain founded was higher than described in the literature, probably because our sample was less selected than the published in clinical trials. After the scheduled appointment, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean pain intensity, but the explicit use of this questionnaire was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of pain.  Conclusion:   Patients with metastatic prostate cancer have a high prevalence of pain. Evaluation and treatment by medical oncologists is associated with a reduction of mean pain intensity. The use of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was associated with a non-significant increased reduction of pain.""","""['Maria Inês Sequeira', 'Nuno Sousa', 'Maria Fragoso', 'Alexandra Silva', 'Filipa Pereira', 'Luís Azevedo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Med Port""","""['Prevalence and management of pain in patients with metastatic cancer in Franche-Comté.', 'Pubic Bone Resection Provides Objective Pain Control in the Prostate Cancer Survivor With Pubic Bone Osteomyelitis With an Associated Urinary Tract to Pubic Symphysis Fistula.', 'Effect of abiraterone acetate and prednisone compared with placebo and prednisone on pain control and skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis of data from the COU-AA-301 randomised trial.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Neurologic complications of prostate cancer.']"""

However, in prostate cancer, the roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs especially ANRIL were largely unknown. We investigated the effects of ANRIL on the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells using CCK-8 assay and Transwell migration assay. Real-time PCR and western blotting assays were used to analyze the levels of ANRIL, let-7a, TGF-β1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad7. Our results showed that ANRIL was significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues compared with corresponding normal tissues. Knockdown of ANRIL significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer LNCap, PC3 and DU145 cells. Knockdown of ANRIL significantly decreased the levels of TGF-β1 and p-Smad2, and increased the level of p-Smad7 in prostate cancer LNCap cells. We further found that knockdown of ANRIL significantly enhanced the expression of let-7a, and rescue experiment found that let-7a inhibitor recovered the suppressive effects of ANRIL silencing on the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer LNCap, PC3 and DU145 cells. And let-7a inhibitor recovered the suppressive effects of ANRIL silencing on the activity of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in prostate cancer LNCap cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that overexpression of lncRNA ANRIL promoted the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells via regulating let-7a/TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.""","""['Bin Zhao', 'Yu-Lin Lu', 'Yong Yang', 'Li-Bing Hu', 'Yu Bai', 'Rui-Qian Li', 'Guo-Ying Zhang', 'Jun Li', 'Cheng-Wei Bi', 'Li-Bo Yang', 'Chen Hu', 'Yong-Hong Lei', 'Qi-Lin Wang', 'Zhi-Min Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Let-7a Inhibits Tumor Metastasis by Regulating TGF-β/Smad Signaling in the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Cell Line LS-174T.', 'Long non-coding RNA ANRIL promotes the invasion and metastasis of thyroid cancer cells through TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.', 'ANRIL: a pivotal tumor suppressor long non-coding RNA in human cancers.', 'Long noncoding RNA ANRIL as a novel biomarker in human cancer.', 'Cellular mechanotransduction in health and diseases: from molecular mechanism to therapeutic targets.', 'LncRNA ANRIL promotes HR repair through regulating PARP1 expression by sponging miR-7-5p in lung cancer.', 'LncRNA CCAT2, involving miR-34a/TGF-β1/Smad4 signaling, regulate hepatic stellate cells proliferation.', 'Sasanquasaponin inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Smad pathways.', 'YAP/Smad3 promotes pathological extracellular matrix microenviroment-induced bladder smooth muscle proliferation in bladder fibrosis progression.']"""
