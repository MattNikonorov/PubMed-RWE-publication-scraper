Ten prostate cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were studied. Nine or ten CBCT scans were performed for each patient. First, rigid registration was performed between the planning CT and all CBCT images using gold fiducial markers, and then DIR was performed. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and center of mass (COM) displacement were used to evaluate the quantitative DIR accuracy. The average DSCs for intensity-based DIR for the prostate, rectum, bladder, and seminal vesicles were 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.75 ± 0.05, 0.69 ± 0.07 and 0.65 ± 0.11, respectively, whereas those values for hybrid DIR were 0.98 ± 0.00, 0.97 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.00 and 0.94 ± 0.03, respectively (P < 0.05). The average COM displacements for intensity-based DIR for the prostate, rectum, bladder, and seminal vesicles were 2.0 ± 1.5, 3.7 ± 1.4, 7.8 ± 2.2 and 3.6 ± 1.2 mm, whereas those values for hybrid DIR were 0.1 ± 0.0, 0.3 ± 0.2, 0.2 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.6 mm, respectively (P < 0.05). These results showed that the DSC for hybrid DIR had a higher DSC value and smaller COM displacement for all structures and all patients, compared with intensity-based DIR. Thus, the accumulative dose based on hybrid DIR might be trusted as a high-precision dose estimation method that takes into account organ movement during treatment radiotherapy.""","""['Yoshiki Takayama', 'Noriyuki Kadoya', 'Takaya Yamamoto', 'Kengo Ito', 'Mizuki Chiba', 'Kousei Fujiwara', 'Yuya Miyasaka', 'Suguru Dobashi', 'Kiyokazu Sato', 'Ken Takeda', 'Keiichi Jingu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Evaluation of on-board kV cone beam computed tomography-based dose calculation with deformable image registration using Hounsfield unit modifications.', 'Deformable image registration for contour propagation from CT to cone-beam CT scans in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of hybrid deformable image registration algorithms in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Benefits and limitations of using a portable ultrasound scanner (bladderscan) in pelvic radiotherapy.

We studied the fracture risk amongst Chinese patients with carcinoma of the prostate prescribed different ADT regimens.  Subjects and methods:   This was a single-centered observational study that involved 741 patients with carcinoma of the prostate from January 2001 to December 2011.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 5 years, 71.7% of the study cohort received ADT and the incidence rate of fracture was 8.1%. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that use of ADT was significantly associated with risk of incident fracture (Hazard Ratio [HR] 3.60; 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 1.41-9.23; p = 0.008), together with aged >75 years and type 2 diabetes. Compared with no ADT, all three types of ADT were independently associated with the risk of incident fracture: anti-androgen monotherapy (HR 4.47; 95% CI 1.47-13.7; p = 0.009), bilateral orchiectomy ± anti-androgens (HR 4.01; 95% CI 1.46-11.1; p = 0.007) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists ± anti-androgens (HR 3.16; 95% CI 1.18-8.43; p = 0.022).

To address this problem, we analyzed miRNA expression in AfA (n = 81) and CaA (n = 51) PCa patients. Here, we found that miR-24 is differentially expressed in AfA and CaA PCa patients and attempt to clarify its role in AfA patients. Also, the public sequencing data of the miR-24 promoter confirmed that it was highly methylated and down-regulated in PCa patients. Utilizing a VAMCSF and NDRI patient cohorts, we discovered that miR-24 expression was linked to a racial difference between AfA/CaA PCa patients. Interestingly, miR-24 was restored after treatment of PCa cells with 5Aza-CdR in an AfA cell line (MDA-PCa-2b), while restoration of miR-24 was not observed in CaA cells, DU-145. Ectopic expression of miR-24 showed decreased growth and induced apoptosis, though the effect was less in the CaA cell line compared to the AfA cell line. Finally, we found unique changes in biological pathways and processes associated with miR-24 transfected AfA cells by quantitative PCR-based gene expression array. Evaluation of the altered pathways showed that AR, IGF1, IGFBP5 and ETV1 were markedly decreased in the AfA derived cell line compared with CaA cells, and there was a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-24/target expression in prostate cancer patients. These results demonstrate that miR-24 may be a central regulator of key events that contribute to race-related tumorigenesis and has potential to be a therapeutic agent for PCa treatment.""","""['Yutaka Hashimoto', 'Marisa Shiina', 'Taku Kato', 'Soichiro Yamamura', 'Yuichiro Tanaka', 'Shahana Majid', 'Sharanjot Saini', 'Varahram Shahryari', 'Priyanka Kulkarni', 'Pritha Dasgupta', 'Yozo Mitsui', 'Mitsuho Sumida', 'Guoren Deng', 'Laura Tabatabai', 'Deepak Kumar', 'Rajvir Dahiya']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Differential expression of miR-34b and androgen receptor pathway regulate prostate cancer aggressiveness between African-Americans and Caucasians.', 'Micro-RNA-186-5p inhibition attenuates proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA profiling of novel African American and Caucasian Prostate Cancer cell lines reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-152 and DNA methyltranferase 1.', 'miR-564 inhibited metastasis and proliferation of prostate cancer by targeting MLLT3.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Review of Active Surveillance in Underrepresented and High-Risk Populations: Feasibility and Safety.', 'Expression of miR-24-1-5p in Tumor Tissue Influences Prostate Cancer Recurrence: The PROCA-life Study.', 'Versatile role of miR-24/24-1*/24-2* expression in cancer and other human diseases.', 'Integrative Analysis of DNA Methylation and microRNA Expression Reveals Mechanisms of Racial Heterogeneity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Role of miR-182/PDCD4 axis in aggressive behavior of prostate cancer in the African Americans.']"""

In our study, the in vivo protective effect of danshen in prostate cancer patients was validated through data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. In vitro, we discovered that dihydroisotanshinone I (DT), a bioactive compound present in danshen, can inhibit the migration of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In addition, we noted that DT substantially inhibited the migratory ability of prostate cancer cells in both a macrophage-conditioned medium and macrophage/prostate cancer coculture medium. Mechanistically, DT both diminished the ability of prostate cancer cells to recruit macrophages and reduced the secretion of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) from both macrophages and prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DT inhibited the protein expression of p-STAT3 and decreased the translocation of STAT3 into nuclear chromatin. DT also suppressed the expression of tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes, including RhoA and SNAI1. In conclusion, danshen can prolong the survival rate of prostate cancer patients in Taiwan. Furthermore, DT can inhibit the migration of prostate cancer cells by interrupting the crosstalk between prostate cancer cells and macrophages via the inhibition of the CCL2/STAT3 axis. These results may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach toward the treatment of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Ching-Yuan Wu', 'Yao-Hsu Yang', 'Yin-Yin Lin', 'Feng-Che Kuan', 'Yu-Shin Lin', 'Wei-Yu Lin', 'Ming-Yen Tsai', 'Jia-Jing Yang', 'Yu-Ching Cheng', 'Li-Hsin Shu', 'Ming-Chu Lu', 'Yun-Ju Chen', 'Kuan-Der Lee', 'Hong-Yo Kang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""[]"""

Because of this activity, it has gained interest for scientific investigations. RES inhibits tumor growth and progression by targeting mitochondria-dependent or -independent pathways. However, further investigations are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.The present study is focused on examining the role of RES-induced, mitochondria-mediated, caspase-independent apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, namely transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) cells. These cells were exposed to RES for various times, and cell killing, cell morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), expression of Bax and Bcl2 proteins, the role of caspase-3, and DNA fragmentation were analyzed.TRAMP cells exposed to RES showed decreased cell viability, altered cell morphology, and disrupted Δψm, which led to aberrant expression of Bax and Bcl2 proteins. Furthermore, since the caspase-3 inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-valine-alanine-aspartic acid-fluoromethyl ketone), had no appreciable impact on RES-induced cell killing, the killing was evidently caspase-independent. In addition, RES treatment of TRAMP-C1, TRAMP-C2, and TRAMP-C3 cells caused an appreciable breakage of genomic DNA into low-molecular-weight fragments.These findings show that, in inhibition of proliferation of TRAMP cells, RES induces mitochondria-mediated, caspase-independent apoptosis. Therefore, RES may be utilized as a therapeutic agent to control the proliferation and growth of cancer cells.""","""['Sanjay Kumar', 'Erdal Eroglu', 'James A Stokes rd', 'Karyn Scissum-Gunn', 'Sabita N Saldanha', 'Udai P Singh', 'Upender Manne', 'Selvarangan Ponnazhagan', 'Manoj K Mishra']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Caspase-dependent apoptosis induction by phenethyl isothiocyanate, a cruciferous vegetable-derived cancer chemopreventive agent, is mediated by Bak and Bax.', 'Prolonged exposure of resveratrol induces reactive superoxide species-independent apoptosis in murine prostate cells.', 'Resveratrol-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells involves a caspase-independent mechanism with downregulation of Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB.', 'Resveratrol--from the bottle to the bedside?', 'Targeting caspases in cancer therapeutics.', 'Mitochondria-Targeted Delivery of Camptothecin Based on HPMA Copolymer for Metastasis Suppression.', 'Functions of polyphenols and its anticancer properties in biomedical research: a narrative review.', 'Comparison of the Effects of Resveratrol and Its Derivatives on the Radiation Response of MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Potential Anti-Tumor Activity of Kefir-Induced Juglone and Resveratrol Fractions Against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma-Bearing BALB/C Mice.', 'Resveratrol, cancer and cancer stem cells: A review on past to future.']"""

The aim of this study is to compare dosimetric results of Cyberknife (CK) with Tomotherapy (HT) in SBRT for localized prostate cancer. Furthermore, the radiobiologic consequences of heterogeneous dose distribution are also analyzed.  Material and method:   A total of 12 cases of localized prostate cancer previously treated with SBRT were collected. Treatments had been planned and delivered using CK. Then HT plans were generated for comparison afterwards. The prescribed dose was 37.5Gy in 5 fractions. Dosimetric indices for target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) were compared. For radiobiological evaluation, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were calculated and compared.  Result:   Both CK and HT achieved target coverage while meeting OAR constraints adequately. HT plans resulted in better dose homogeneity (Homogeneity index: 1.04±0.01 vs. 1.21±0.01; p = 0.0022), target coverage (97.74±0.86% vs. 96.56±1.17%; p = 0.0076) and conformity (new vonformity index: 1.16±0.05 vs. 1.21±0.04; p = 0.0096). HT was shown to predict lower late rectal toxicity as compared to CK. Integral dose to body was also significantly lower in HT plans (46.59±6.44 Gy'L vs 57.05±11.68 Gy'L; p = 0.0029).  Conclusion:   Based on physical dosimetry and radiobiologic considerations, HT may have advantages over CK, specifically in rectal sparing which could translate into clinical benefit of decreased late toxicities.""","""['Chun-You Chen', 'Liang-Ming Lee', 'Hsiao-Wei Yu', 'Steve P Lee', 'Hsin-Lun Lee', 'Yung-Wei Lin', 'Yu-Ching Wen', 'Yi-Ju Chen', 'Chiu-Ping Chen', 'Jo-Ting Tsai']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Xray Sci Technol""","""['Cyberknife, Helical Tomotherapy and Rapid Arc SIB-SBRT Treatment Plan Comparison for Carcinoma Prostate.', 'A treatment planning study comparing IMRT techniques and cyber knife for stereotactic body radiotherapy of low-risk prostate carcinoma.', 'Assessment of HDR brachytherapy-replicating prostate radiotherapy planning for tomotherapy, cyberknife and VMAT.', 'Extreme Hypofractionation with SBRT in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'SBRT for Localized Prostate Cancer: CyberKnife vs. VMAT-FFF, a Dosimetric Study.', 'Ultrahypofractionated Radiotherapy versus Conventional to Moderate Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison among cyberknife, helical tomotherapy and VMAT for hypofractionated treatment in localized prostate cancer.', 'Cyberknife, Helical Tomotherapy and Rapid Arc SIB-SBRT Treatment Plan Comparison for Carcinoma Prostate.']"""

Clinically relevant preclinical models are needed to increase our understanding of biology of this malignancy and to evaluate new agents that might provide effective treatment. Our objective was to establish and characterize patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from advanced prostate cancer (PC) for investigation of biology and evaluation of new treatment modalities.  Methods:   Samples of advanced PC obtained from primary prostate cancer obtained at surgery or from metastases collected at time of death were implanted into immunocompromised mice to establish PDXs. Established PDXs were propagated in vivo. Genomic, transcriptomic, and STR profiles were generated. Responses to androgen deprivation and docetaxel in vivo were characterized.  Results:   We established multiple PDXs (LuCaP series), which represent the major genomic and phenotypic features of the disease in humans, including amplification of androgen receptor, PTEN deletion, TP53 deletion and mutation, RB1 loss, TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements, SPOP mutation, hypermutation due to MSH2/MSH6 genomic aberrations, and BRCA2 loss. The PDX models also exhibit variation in intra-tumoral androgen levels. Our in vivo results show heterogeneity of response to androgen deprivation and docetaxel, standard therapies for advanced PC, similar to the responses of patients to these treatments.  Conclusions:   The LuCaP PDX series reflects the diverse molecular composition of human castration-resistant PC and allows for hypothesis-driven cause-and-effect studies of mechanisms underlying treatment response and resistance.

Overall, 105 patients (35%) reported less, 80 patients (27%) more, and 94 patients (31%) equal amount of pain during marker implantation compared to biopsy. The 21 patients who had a biopsy performed under general anesthesia did not answer this question.  Conclusion:   Transperineal gold marker implantation under local anesthesia was well tolerated. Complications were limited; rate and frequency of perioperative pain was comparable to the pain caused by biopsy.

However, the function significance of DIXDC1 in prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of DIXDC1 in prostate cancer and the regulation of DIXDC1 by microRNAs (miRNAs). We found that DIXDC1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of DIXDC1 by small interfering RNAs markedly suppressed proliferation, invasion and Wnt signaling in prostate cancer cells. DIXDC1 was identified as a target gene of miR-1271 by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, DIXDC1 expression was inversely correlated with miR-1271 expression in prostate cancer tissues. The overexpression of miR-1271 significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion and Wnt signaling in prostate cancer cells. However, the inhibition of miR-1271 exhibits the opposite effects. Moreover, the overexpression of DIXDC1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-1271 overexpression. Taken together, our results suggest that DIXDC1 plays an important role in regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion.

Accordingly, a critical analysis of its volume-outcome relationship has important health policy implications. Therefore, we evaluated the association of hospital robot-assisted radical prostatectomy volume with perioperative outcomes, and examined the distribution of hospital procedure volume to contextualize the volume-outcome relationship.  Materials and methods:   We identified 140,671 men who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy from 2009 to 2011 in NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample). The associations of hospital volume with perioperative outcomes and total hospital costs were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models.  Results:   In 2011, 70% of hospitals averaged 1 robot-assisted radical prostatectomy per week or less, accounting for 28% of surgeries. Compared to patients treated at the lowest quartile hospitals, those treated at the highest quartile hospitals had significantly lower rates of intraoperative complications (0.6% vs 1.4%), postoperative complications (4.8% vs 13.9%), perioperative blood transfusion (1.5% vs 4.0%), prolonged hospitalization (4.3% vs 13.8%) and mean total hospital costs ($12,647 vs $15,394, all ptrend <0.001). When modeled as a nonlinear continuous variable, increasing hospital volume was independently associated with improved rates of each perioperative end point up to approximately 100 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies per year, beyond which there appeared to be marginal improvement.  Conclusions:   Increasing hospital robot-assisted radical prostatectomy volume was associated with improved perioperative outcomes up to approximately 100 surgeries per year, beyond which there appeared to be marginal improvement. A substantial proportion of these procedures is performed at low volume hospitals.""","""['Boris Gershman', 'Sarah K Meier', 'Molly M Jeffery', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Matthew K Tollefson', 'Simon P Kim', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Nilay D Shah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Robot-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy: the differential effect of regionalization, procedure volume and operative approach.', 'Surgeon and Hospital Level Variation in the Costs of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer.', ""Impact of Robotic Technologies on Prostate Cancer Patients' Choice for Radical Treatment."", ""Robotic-assisted surgery for\xa0prostatectomy - does the diffusion of robotic systems contribute to treatment centralization and influence patients' hospital choice?"", 'Reassessment of Prostate Biopsy Specimens for Patients Referred for Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Rarely Influences Surgical Planning.', 'Difference in Incontinence Pad Use between Patients after Radical Prostatectomy and Cancer-Free Population with Subgroup Analysis for Open vs. Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy: A Descriptive Analysis of Insurance Claims-Based Data.', 'Association of surgeon and hospital volume with short-term outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Nationwide, population-based study.']"""

Currently available assays for CTC detection rely on epithelial markers with somewhat limited sensitivity and specificity. We found that the staining pattern of nucleolin, a common nucleolar protein in proliferative cells, separates CTCs from white blood cells (WBCs) in men with metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Whole peripheral blood from 3 men with metastatic prostate cancer was processed with the AccuCyte CTC system (RareCyte, Seattle, WA). Slides were immunostained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), anti-pan-cytokeratin, anti-CD45/CD66b/CD11b/CD14/CD34, and anti-nucleolin antibodies and detected using the CyteFinder system. DAPI nucleolin colocalization and staining pattern wavelet entropy were measured with novel image analysis software.  Results:   A total of 33,718 DAPI-positive cells were analyzed with the novel imaging software, of which 45 (0.13%) were known CTCs based on the established AccuCyte system criteria. Nucleolin staining pattern for segmentable CTCs demonstrated greater wavelet entropy than that of WBCs (median wavelet entropy, 6.86 × 107 and 3.03 × 106, respectively; P = 2.92 × 10-22; approximated z statistic = 9.63). Additionally, the total nucleolin staining of CTCs was greater than that of WBCs (median total pixel intensity, 1.20 × 105 and 2.55 × 104 integrated pixel units, respectively; P = 2.40 × 10-21; approximated z statistic = 9.41).  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer CTCs displayed unique nucleolin expression and localization compared to WBCs.

We used immunohistochemistry and H scoring to document stromal localisation of ASPN in a tissue microarray and mouse prostate cancer model, and correlated expression with reactive stroma, defined using Masson Trichrome staining. We used cell cultures of primary prostate cancer fibroblasts treated with serum-free conditioned media from prostate cancer cell lines to examine regulation of ASPN mRNA in tumour stromal cells.  Results:   We observed increased expression of ASPN mRNA in a data set derived from benign vs tumour microdissected tissue, and a correlation with biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. ASPN protein localised to tumour stroma and elevated expression of ASPN was correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence, in a cohort of 326 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ASPN was correlated with progression, as were Gleason score, and clinical stage. Additionally, ASPN expression correlated with the presence of reactive stroma, suggesting that it may be a stromal marker expressed in response to the presence of tumour cells and particularly with aggressive tumour subtypes. We observed expression of ASPN in the stroma of tumours induced by p53 inhibition in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and correlation with neuroendocrine marker expression. Finally, we demonstrated that ASPN transcript expression in normal and cancer fibroblasts was regulated by conditioned media derived from the PC3, but not LNCaP, prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that ASPN is a stromally expressed biomarker that correlates with disease progression, and is observed in reactive stroma.

A reduced expression of Bin1 caused by DNA methylation, has been reported in breast and prostate cancers. However, the methylation status of Bin1 and potent biological functions in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear. In a previous study, we showed that the Bin1 expression was low in ESCC tissues. Herein, we further characterized this mechanism, confirming that gene hypermethylation was significantly correlated with the aberrant attenuation of Bin1. In addition, the Bin1 hypermethylation was associated with the poorer clinical parameters and shorter survival times of ESCC patients. Methylation-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (MS-RT-PCR) showed that Bin1 was hypermethylated in several ESCC cell lines, which might be the main cause of reduced Bin1 expression. In addition, treatment with the de-methylation agent Decitabine (DAC) could restore Bin1 expression and evidently restrained ESCC cell malignant behaviors, particularly the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) via reactivating the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression in vitro and in vivo.

The objective of the current study was to assess the relationship between LN yield and survival among patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).  Methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients with non-metastatic UTUC who were treated with RNU between 2004 and 2012. The association between LN yield and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression, with adjustment for patient, tumor, and facility characteristics.  Results:   Of the 14,472 patients, 2926 (20%) underwent LND. The median yield was 2 LNs (interquartile range 1-6 LNs).

Using data from PDS, we aimed to 1) validate a contemporary prognostic model (Templeton et al., 2014) 2) evaluate prognostic impact of concomitant medications and PSA decrease 3) evaluate factors associated with docetaxel toxicity.  Methods:   We accessed data on 2,449 mCRPC patients in PDS. The existing model was validated with a continuous risk score, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and corresponding time-dependent Area under the Curve (tAUC). The prognostic effects of concomitant medications and PSA response were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models. One year tAUC was calculated for multivariable prognostic model optimized to our data. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess associations with grade 3/4 adverse events (G3/4 AE) at baseline and after cycle 1 of treatment.  Results:   Despite limitations of the PDS data set, the existing model was validated; one year AUC, was 0.68 (95% CI 95% CI, .66 to .71) to 0.78 (95%CI, .74 to .81) depending on the subset of datasets used. A new model was constructed with an AUC of .74 (.72 to .77). Concomitant medications low molecular weight heparin and warfarin were associated with poorer survival, Metformin and Cox2 inhibitors were associated with better outcome. PSA response was associated with survival, the effect of which was greatest early in follow-up. Age was associated with baseline risk of G3/4 AE. The odds of experiencing G3/4 AE later on in treatment were significantly greater for subjects who experienced a G3/4 AE in their first cycle (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.53-4.91, p < .0001).  Conclusion:   Despite heterogeneous data collection protocols, PDS provides access to large datasets for novel outcomes analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate its utility for validating existing models and novel model generation including the utility of concomitant medications in outcome analyses, as well as the effect of PSA response on survival and toxicity prediction.""","""['Bethany Pitcher', 'Leila Khoja', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Kald Abdallah', 'Melania Pintilie', 'Anthony M Joshua']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.', 'The efficacy and toxicity of cabazitaxel for treatment of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer correlating with the initial doses in Japanese patients.', 'Prognostic model predicting metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer survival in men treated with second-line chemotherapy.', 'Prognostic impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in an elderly patient subgroup (aged 75 and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Polycystic Kidney Disease Drug Development: A Conference Report.', 'Development of castration resistance in prostate cancer patients treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues (LHRHa): results of the ANARESISTANCE study.', 'Prognostic value of ECOG performance status and Gleason score in the survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Prognostic models for predicting overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Identification of subgroups of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated with abiraterone plus prednisone at low- vs. high-risk of radiographic progression: An analysis of COU-AA-302.']"""

Optimal AR antagonism may effectively cytoreduce local disease and suppress or eliminate micrometastases. We evaluated neoadjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy with the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide (enza) either alone or in combination with dutasteride (dut) and leuprolide (enza/dut/luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues [LHRHa]).Experimental Design: Forty-eight of 52 men with intermediate or high-risk localized prostate cancer proceeded to prostatectomy after neoadjuvant enzalutamide or enza/dut/LHRHa for 6 months. We assessed pathologic complete response (pCR), minimal residual disease (MRD; ≤3 mm maximum diameter of residual disease), residual cancer burden (RCB), and expression of PSA and serum and tissue androgen concentrations. We compared the proportion of patients with pCR in each treatment arm with a historical control rate of 5%, based on previous reports of flutamide with LHRHa.Results: In the enzalutamide arm, none of the 25 patients achieved pCR or MRD. In the enza/dut/LHRHa arm, one of 23 patients (4.3%) achieved pCR and 3 of 23 (13.0%) achieved MRD. Median RCB was higher in the enzalutamide arm than in the enza/dut/LHRHa arm (0.41 cm3 vs. 0.06 cm3, respectively). Tissue testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels correlated with RCB. No adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported.Conclusions: Combination therapy with enza/dut/LHRHa resulted in pCR and MRD rates comparable with historical controls. Evidence of continued AR activity in residual tumor suggests that AR signaling may contribute to survival. Strategies to more effectively ablate AR activity are warranted to determine whether more substantial antitumor effects are observed.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 125 patients with localised prostate cancer treated between April 2014 (programme commencement) and June 2015 were compared: 65 with SpaceOAR (inserted by five different urologists) and 60 patients treated over the same time period without SpaceOAR. Patients were treated with 81 Gy in 45Fx of IMRT over 9 weeks. Planning aims included restricting rectal doses to V40 Gy < 35%, V65 Gy < 17%, V75 Gy < 10%. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiotherapy and at 12 weeks.  Results:   Rectal volume parameters were all significantly lower in the SpaceOAR group, with an associated reduction in acute diarrhoea (13.8% vs 31.7%). There were no significant differences in the very low rates of acute and late faecal incontinence or proctitis, however, there was a trend towards increased haemorrhoid rate in the SpaceOAR group (11.7% vs 3.1%, P = 0.09).

The therapy attempting to target AR signalling was established in decades ago but the treatment of prostate cancer is far from being satisfactory. The assignable cause is that our understanding of the mechanism of AR regulation and re-activation remains incomplete. Increasing evidence suggests that deubiquitinases are involved in the regulation of cancer development and progression but the specific underlying mechanism often is not elucidated. In the current study, we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) as a novel regulator of AR, inhibiting the degradation of AR via deubiquitinating this oncoprotein in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells. We found that (i) USP14 could bind to AR, and additionally, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of USP14 accelerated the ubiquitination and degradation of AR; (ii) downregulation or inhibition of USP14 suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of LNcap cells and, conversely, overexpression of USP14 promoted the proliferation; and (iii) reduction or inhibition of USP14 induced G0/G1 phase arrest in LNcap prostate cancer cells. Hence, we conclude that USP14 promotes prostate cancer progression likely through stabilization of AR, suggesting that USP14 could be a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Yuning Liao', 'Ningning Liu', 'Xianliang Hua', 'Jianyu Cai', 'Xiaohong Xia', 'Xuejun Wang', 'Hongbiao Huang', 'Jinbao Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Growth arrest and apoptosis induction in androgen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells by inhibition of USP14-mediated androgen receptor deubiquitination.', 'The Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP7 Regulates Androgen Receptor Activity by Modulating Its Binding to Chromatin.', 'Selective degradation of AR-V7 to overcome castration resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Degradation and beyond: control of androgen receptor activity by the proteasome system.', 'Emerging role of ubiquitin-specific protease 14 in oncogenesis and development of tumor: Therapeutic implication.', 'A review of deubiquitinases and thier roles in tumorigenesis and development.', 'Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'Targeted protein posttranslational modifications by chemically induced proximity for cancer therapy.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'USP14 promotes colorectal cancer progression by targeting JNK for stabilization.']"""

SERCA enzymes are encoded by three different genes (ATP2A1-3), whose expression occurs in a tissue and development stage-specific manner. It has been reported alterations in the expression of SERCA2 and SERCA3 pumps in different types of cancer: oral, lung, colon, stomach, central nervous system, thyroid, breast, and prostate. Resveratrol (RSV), a phytoalexin produced by a wide variety of plants in response to stress situations can modulate cellular processes involved in all stages of carcinogenesis. In this work, we used breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) to evaluate mRNA levels of ATP2A2 and ATP2A3 genes in response to RSV treatment. Our results demonstrate that RSV treatment induced the expression of ATP2A3 gene in both cell lines in a time and concentration-dependent manner, while the expression of ATP2A2 gene remained unaffected. The RSV-induced expression of SERCA3 in these breast cancer cell lines produced decreased cell viability, triggered apoptosis and changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, as well as changes in the capacity for Ca2+ release by the ER. These data suggest an important participation of SERCA3 genes in RSV-mediated anti-tumor effect in breast cancer cell lines.

To compare East and West Germany we computed the ratio of the mortality rates in both parts (mortality rate ratio, MRR, <1 indicates a lower mortality in EG). Forecasting methods of time series analyses were applied (model selection based on the Box/Jenkins approach) to predict 5-year trends until 2019.  Results:   Lung cancer: In women mortality rose in both regions (WG: +2.8%, 1991-2014, EG: +2.2%, 1990-2014).

Currently, the most common non-invasive approach for screening and risk assessment of PC is measuring the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, the sensitivity of PSA is 42.8 % and specificity is 41.1%. As a result, the serum PSA test leads to numerous unneeded biopsies. Therefore, a rigorous search for biomarkers for early detection of PC is ongoing. In this study, we aim to assess a panel of epigenetic markers in an intend to develop an early detection test for PC.  Results:   The sensitivity and specificity of hypermethylation of MCAM was 66% and 73% respectively which is an improvement from the sensitivity and specificity of PSA. Considering a combination marker panel of MCAM, ERα and ERβ increased the sensitivity to 75% and the specificity became 70% for the minimally invasive early detection test of PC.  Materials and methods:   Sixteen primary matched tumor and serum were analyzed by quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) to determine analytical and clinical sensitivity of the genes tested (SSBP2, MCAM, ERα, ERβ, APC, CCND2, MGMT, GSTP1, p16 and RARβ2). Additionally, serum samples from eighty four cases of PC, thirty controls and seven cases diagnosed as high grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HGPIN) were analyzed.  Conclusions:   Promoter methylation of MCAM, ERα and ERβ have a potential to be utilized as biomarker for the early detection of prostate PC as their sensitivity and specificity seem to be better than serum PSA in our cohort of samples.

GGH staining was considered as low intensity in 49.6% and as high intensity in 38.6% of cancers. High GGH expression was linked to the TMPRSS2:ERG-fusion positive subset of cancers (p < 0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage, and high Gleason grade (p < 0.0001 each). Further analysis revealed that these associations were merely driven by the subset of ERG-negative cancers, High GGH expression was weakly linked to early biochemical recurrence in ERG negative cancers (p < 0.0001) and independent from established histo-pathological parameters. Moreover, GGH expression was linked to features of genetic instability, including presence of recurrent deletions at 3p, 5q, 6q, and 10q (PTEN, p ≤ 0.01 each), as well as to accelerated cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry (p < 0.0001).

Based on evidence that PCa cells can transdifferentiate to other neuroectodermally-derived cell lineages in vitro, we proposed that NEtD requires first an intermediary reprogramming to metastable cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) of a neural class and we demonstrate that several different AR+/PSA+ PCa cell lines were efficiently reprogrammed to, maintained and propagated as CSCs by growth in androgen-free neural/neural crest (N/NC) stem medium. Such reprogrammed cells lost features of prostate differentiation; gained features of N/NC stem cells and tumor-initiating potential; were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition; and acquired an invasive phenotype in vitro and in vivo. When placed back into serum-containing mediums, reprogrammed cells could be re-differentiated to N-/NC-derived cell lineages or return back to an AR+ prostate-like state. Once returned, the AR+ cells were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition. Acute androgen deprivation or anti-androgen treatment in serum-containing medium led to the transient appearance of a sub-population of cells with similar characteristics. Finally, a 132 gene signature derived from reprogrammed PCa cell lines distinguished tumors from PCa patients with adverse outcomes. This model may explain neural manifestations of PCa associated with lethal disease. The metastable nature of the reprogrammed stem-like PCa cells suggests that cycles of PCa cell reprogramming followed by re-differentiation may support disease progression and therapeutic resistance. The ability of a gene signature from reprogrammed PCa cells to identify tumors from patients with metastasis or PCa-specific mortality implies that developmental reprogramming is linked to aggressive tumor behaviors.""","""['Mannan Nouri', 'Josselin Caradec', 'Amy Anne Lubik', 'Na Li', 'Brett G Hollier', 'Mandeep Takhar', 'Manuel Altimirano-Dimas', 'Mengqian Chen', 'Mani Roshan-Moniri', 'Miriam Butler', 'Melanie Lehman', 'Jennifer Bishop', 'Sarah Truong', 'Shih-Chieh Huang', 'Dawn Cochrane', 'Michael Cox', 'Colin Collins', 'Martin Gleave', 'Nicholas Erho', 'Mohamed Alshalafa', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Colleen Nelson', 'Sheryl Gregory-Evans', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Robert B Jenkins', 'Eric A Klein', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Castration induces up-regulation of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis and androgen receptor expression in an orthotopic VCaP human prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate carcinoma: focusing on its pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathological features.', 'Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells from Patient-Derived Xenograft to Model Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Development.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'A Pitfall of the Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Salivary Duct Carcinoma: Hormonal Therapy-Induced Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Extensive androgen receptor enhancer heterogeneity in primary prostate cancers underlies transcriptional diversity and metastatic potential.', 'Wntless expression promotes lineage plasticity and is associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Epigenetic Plasticity and Enhancer Heterogeneity: Molecular Causes, Consequences and Clinical Implications.', 'Changes in prostate-specific antigen kinetics during androgen-deprivation therapy as a predictor of response to abiraterone in chemonaïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We sought to identify factors associated with late rectal bleeding following intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using TomoTherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 82 patients with localised prostate cancer treated with TomoTherapy. Most patients (95.1%) received neoadjuvant and concurrent hormone therapy. Forty-two patients (51.2%) graded as high risk using D'Amico's classification underwent radiotherapy involving the pelvic nodal area. Late bleeding complications were quantified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Multiple clinical and dosimetric factors were considered with reference to rectal bleeding.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 538 (range, 128-904) days. Grades 1, 2 and 3 rectal bleeding were observed in 14 (17.1%), four (4.9%) and one (1.2%) patient respectively. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with Grade ≥1 late rectal bleeding: volume, mean dose (P = 0.012) and rectal V30 (P = 0.025), V40 (P = 0.011), V50 (P = 0.017) and V60 (P = 0.036).

Conclusions:   Our results suggested that the intermediate rectal dose-volume (V30-V60) was a significant predictor for mild to severe late rectal bleeding (Grade ≥1).

Cases were divided as 83, 73, and 45 of anterior, posterior cancer, and no dominance, respectively. Anterior cancers included significant numbers of high grade tumors (13/83 cases: 15.7%), which was less than posterior cancers (28.8%: 21/73). The cases in pT2+ were significantly more frequent in anterior cases than posterior ones (22.9% vs. 4.1%). No seminal vesicle invasion was shown in anterior cases. Thus, although anterior cancers are less aggressive than posterior cancers, a significant numbers of clinically important cancers were located in the anterior portion in Japanese men.""","""['Shun Sato', 'Hiroyuki Takahashi', 'Takahiro Kimura', 'Shin Egawa', 'Bungo Furusato', 'Masahiro Ikegami']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pathol Int""","""['Clinicopathologic Significance of Anterior Prostate Cancer: Comparison With Posterior Prostate Cancer in the Era of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Incidence of Extraprostatic Extension at Radical Prostatectomy with Pure Gleason Score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1) Cancer: Implications for Whether Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer Should be Renamed ""Not Cancer"" and for Selection Criteria for Active Surveillance.', 'An analysis of 148 consecutive transition zone cancers: clinical and histological characteristics.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Clinical relevance of the individual prostate cancer focus.', 'Clinical outcomes of anterior prostate cancers treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of malignancy and spatial distribution between latent and clinical prostate cancer: an 8-year biopsy study.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer is associated with better clinical outcomes than peripheral zone cancer.', 'External validation of the Briganti 2019 nomogram to identify candidates for extended pelvic lymph node dissection among patients with high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer.']"""

Thematic analysis identified four global themes: illness experience; enacting a supportive response; forming a national collective and challenges. Leaders described men's feelings of isolation and neglect by the health system as the impetus for PCSGs to form and give/receive mutual help. Negotiating health care systems was an early challenge. National affiliation enabled leaders to build a united voice in the health system and establish a group identity and collective voice. Affiliation was supported by a symbiotic relationship with tensions between independence, affiliation and governance. Future challenges were group sustainability and inclusiveness.

In this study we evaluate the SOCS3 immunohistochemical protein expression in different Gleason prostatic adenocarcinoma: classical Gleason grade 3, classical Gleason grade 3 upgraded to Gleason grade 4 according to the ISUP modifications and classical and modified Gleason grade 4. The major conclusions were: (i) Cribriform glands should be assigned a Gleason pattern 4, regardless of morphology; (ii) Glomeruloid glands should be assigned a Gleason pattern 4, regardless of morphology; (iii) Grading of mucinous carcinoma of the prostate should be based on its underlying growth pattern rather than all as pattern 4; and (iv) Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate without invasive carcinoma should not assigned Gleason grade and a comment about aggressive carcinoma probably associated should be made. In a recent report we analyzed the methylathion status of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins 3 (SOCS3) gene and the consequences of promoter hypermethylation on mRNA and protein expression in a collection of prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and for the first time we demonstrated that a hypermethylation of SOCS3 with a significant reduction of its mRNA and protein expression identifies a subgroup of prostate cancer with a more aggressive behavior. Moreover we demonstrated that the immunohystochemical analysis of SOCS3 protein expression in prostatic cancer biopsies may provide a useful and easier method than SOCS3 methylation analysis to individuate in cancer with intermediate-high grade Gleason score a subgroup of prostate cancer with a more aggressive behavior.  Methods:   A total of 148 radical prostatectomy with diagnosis of prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma were stratified into three different categories on the basis of Gleason grade: (i) Twenty-six prostatic adenocarcinoma with classical and modified Gleason grade 3; (ii) Fifty seven prostatic adenocarcinoma with classical Gleason grade 3 upgraded to Gleason grade 4 by 2005 and 2014 ISUP Consensus Conference; and (iii) Sixty five prostatic adenocarcinoma with classical and modified Gleason grade 4. Immunohistochemical analysis for SOCS3 was performed and SOCS3 staining intensity were evaluated by two pathologists in three different ways on the basis of the intensity of cytoplasmatic staining: positive (intense cytoplasmatic staining in more than 50% of neoplastic cells) (+), negative (absence of cytoplasmatic staining in more than 50% of neoplastic cells) (-), weakly positive (weak cytoplasmatic staining in more than 50% of neoplastic cells (+/-).  Results:   In the group of prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 3 we found that SOCS3 positivity (+) were observed in 19 out of 26 cases (73.1%); in 5 out of 26 prostatic adenocarcinoma the neoplastic glands showed weak intensity SOCS3 staining (+/-) (19.2%), while in only two cases we found SOCS-3 negativity (-) (7.7%); in the group of cases with prostatic adenocarcinoma with Gleason grade 4, 16 out 65 cases (24.6%) showed SOCS3 positivity (+); 18 out 65 cases (27.7%) SOCS3 weakly positive (+/-), and in 31 cases (47.7%) SOCS3 negative staining (-) were observed. Interestingly, the group of prostatic adenocarcinoma with histological Gleason 3 pattern upgraded to Gleason 4 pattern according to the 2005 and 2014 ISUP modified grading system, showed SOCS3 positivity (+) in 16 out of 57 cases (28%), in 16 out 57 cases (28%) a weakly positive for SOCS3 (+/-) were observed, while 25 cases (44%) showed negative SOCS3 staining (-).  Conclusions:   In this study we demonstrated a significant association of SOCS3 positivity (+) with prostatic carcinoma classical Gleason pattern 3 (P < 0.0001), while SOCS3 negative pattern (-) or SOCS3 weakly positive pattern (+/-) were associated to prostatic carcinomas with Gleason pattern 3 upgraded to Gleason pattern 4 (P = 0.0002) and with classical Gleason pattern 4. The significant difference of SOCS3 immunohistochemical expression between classical Gleason grade 3 and Gleason grade 4 upgraded to grade 4 seems to support the definitions and the modifications of Gleason grade 4 of the 2005 and the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP). The hypoexpression of SOCS3 protein in glomeruloid glands could support the hypothesis that from molecular point of view this growth pattern could be different from classical Gleason pattern 3 and biologically more closely to Gleason pattern 4, confirming the conclusions of the 2014 ISUP Conference assigning a Gleason pattern 4 to glomeruloid glands regardless of morphology.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) has been the corner stone of prostate cancer treatment for decades. However, despite an initial response of prostate cancer to ADT, this eventually fails and the tumors recur, resulting in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Triptolide, a diterpene triepoxide, has been tested for its anti-tumor properties in a number of cancers for over a decade. Owing to its poor solubility in aqueous medium, its clinical application had been limited. To circumvent this problem, we have synthesized a water-soluble pro-drug of triptolide, Minnelide, that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial against gastrointestinal tumors. In the current study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of Minnelide and its active compound triptolide against androgen dependent prostate cancer both in vitro as well as in vivo.  Methods:   Cell viability was measured by a MTT based assay after treating prostate cancer cells with multiple doses of triptolide. Apoptotic cell death was measured using a caspase 3/7 activity. Androgen Receptor (AR) promoter-binding activity was evaluated by using luciferase reporter assay. For evaluating the effect in vivo, 22Rv1 cells were implanted subcutaneously in animals, following which, treatment was started with 0.21 mg/kg Minnelide.  Results:   Our study showed that treatment with triptolide induced apoptotic cell death in CRPC cells. Triptolide treatment inhibited AR transcriptional activity and decreased the expression of AR and its splice variants both at the mRNA and the protein level. Our studies show that triptolide inhibits nuclear translocation of Sp1, resulting in its decreased transcriptional activity leading to downregulation of AR and its splice variants in prostate cancer cells. In vivo, Minnelide (0.21 mg/kg) regressed subcutaneous tumors derived from CRPC 22RV1 at our study endpoint. Our animal studies further confirmed that Minnelide was more efficacious than the standard of care therapies, Docetaxel and Enzalutamide.  Conclusion:   Our study indicates that Minnelide is very effective as a therapeutic option against CRPC at a dose that is currently tolerated by patients in the ongoing clinical trials.

Specific aim was to examine AR amplification in PC bone metastases and to explore molecular and functional consequences of this, with the long-term goal of identifying novel molecular targets for treatment.  Methods:   Gene amplification was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cryo-sections of clinical PC bone metastases (n = 40) and by PCR-based copy number variation analysis. Whole genome mRNA expression was analyzed using H12 Illumina Beadchip arrays and specific transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. Protein localization was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The YIPF6 mRNA expression was transiently knocked down and stably overexpressed in the 22Rv1 cell line as representative for CRPC, and effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were determined in vitro. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from cell cultures using size-exclusion chromatography and enumerated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Protein content was identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Blood coagulation was measured as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the MetaCore software.  Results:   AR amplification was detected in 16 (53%) of the bone metastases examined from CRPC patients (n = 30), and in none from the untreated patients (n = 10). Metastases with AR amplification showed high AR and AR-V7 mRNA levels, increased nuclear AR immunostaining, and co-amplification of genes such as YIPF6 in the AR proximity at Xq12. The YIPF6 protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus. YIPF6 overexpression in 22Rv1 cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, and in enhanced EV secretion. EVs from YIPF6 overproducing 22Rv1 cells were enriched for proteins involved in blood coagulation and, accordingly, decreased the APTT in a dose-dependent fashion.  Conclusions:   AR amplified CRPC bone metastases show high AR-V7 expression that probably gives resistance to AR-targeting drugs. Co-amplification of the Golgi protein coding YIPF6 gene with the AR may enhance the secretion of pro-coagulative EVs from cancer cells and thereby stimulate tumor progression and increase the coagulopathy risk in CRPC patients.

Methods:   Between 1987 and 2008, 3,755 men underwent radical prostatectomy with curative intent at University of Southern California. Patients who had Gleason score 8-10 at final histopathological evaluation (pT2-4N0) were included in this study. Eligible patients were divided into two groups; 226 with Gleason score 8 and 132 with Gleason score 9-10. Various patient and disease characteristics as well as oncological outcomes (biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence, and overall survival) were compared between the groups. Impact of Gleason score on outcomes was controlled for preoperative prostate specific antigen, pathological stage, use of adjuvant radiotherapy, and neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormone therapy in multivariable analyses.  Results:   A total of 358 patients (mean age: 65 years) were included in the analysis. Mean age and median duration of follow-up (9.6 years) were comparable between the study groups. Gleason 9-10 prostate cancer was associated with worse biochemical (HR 1.6; 95%CI [1.1-2.3]) and clinical recurrence free survival (HR = 1.9; 95%CI [1.1-3.3]); however, overall survival did not differ significantly between the groups. In addition, more patients with Gleason score 9-10 received adjuvant hormone therapy in the course of disease.  Conclusions:   Long-term follow-up after radical prostatectomy revealed significant differences in disease-specific outcomes between patients with Gleason score 8 versus 9-10.

Monoexponential and IVIM model fits were used to calculate both apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the following IVIM parameters: molecular diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f). The ADC and D values were significantly lower in the PCa (0.70 ± 0.16 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.88 ± 0.31 × 10-3 mm2/s) compared to those found in the PZ (1.22 ± 0.20 × 10-3 mm2/s and 1.78 ± 0.34 × 10-3 mm2/s) and in the BPH (1.53 ± 0.23 × 10-3 mm2/s and 1.11 ± 0.28 × 10-3 mm2/s).

We studied whether there is a subpopulation that does not need additional treatment after a suboptimal permanent seed brachytherapy implantation.  Methods and materials:   A total of 486 patients who had either BF or a minimum followup of 48 months without BF were identified. BF was defined according to the Phoenix definition (nadir prostate-specific antigen + 2). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, adjusting for known prognostic factors such as D90 and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) of ≥0.15 ng/mL/cm3, to evaluate their ability to predict BF.  Results:   Median followup for patients without BF was 72 months (interquartile range 56-96). BF-free recurrence rate at 5 years was 95% and at 8 years 88%. In univariate analysis, PSAD and cancer of the prostate risk assessment score were predictive of BF. On multivariate analysis, none of the factors remained significant. The best prognosis had patients with a low PSAD (<0.15 ng/mL/cm3) and an optimal implant at 30 days after implantation (as defined by D90 ≥ 130 Gy) compared to patients with both factors unfavorable (p = 0.006). A favorable PSAD was associate with a good prognosis, independently of the D90 (<130 Gy vs. ≥130 Gy, p = 0.7).  Conclusions:   Patients with a PSAD of <0.15 ng/mL/cm3 have little risk of BF, even in the case of a suboptimal implant.

PCa diagnosis and prognostication might be perfected using epigenetic biomarkers, among which aberrant DNA methylation of microRNA promoters has not been systematically explored. Herein, we identified aberrantly methylated microRNAs promoters in PCa and assessed its diagnostic and prognostic biomarker potential.  Methods:   Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChip-based analysis differentially methylated CpGs in microRNA promoters were identified. Promoter methylation of six microRNAs (miR-34b/c, miR-129-2, miR-152, miR-193b, miR-663a and miR-1258) was analyzed by qMSP in three sets (180 prostatectomies, 95 urine sediments and 74 prostate biopsies). Biomarkers' diagnostic (validity estimates) and prognostic [disease-free (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS)] performance was assessed.  Results:   Significantly higher promoter methylation levels in PCa were confirmed for six candidate microRNAs. Except for miR-152, all displayed AUC values higher than 0.90, with miR-1258 and miR-193b disclosing the best performance (AUC = 0.99 and AUC = 0.96, respectively).

Methods:   Representative areas of prostate carcinoma (n = 51) and of nodular prostate hyperplasia (n = 20) were analysed for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), lysyl oxidase (LOX) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR2) immunohistochemistry expression using a tissue microarray. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and used to genotype functional polymorphisms at the corresponding genes (HIF1A +1772 C > T, rs11549465; CA9 + 201 A > G; rs2071676; LOX +473 G > A, rs1800449; KDR - 604 T > C, rs2071559).  Results:   Immunohistochemistry analyses disclosed predominance of positive CAIX and VEGFR2 expression in epithelial cells of prostate carcinomas compared to nodular prostate hyperplasia (P = 0.043 and P = 0.035, respectively). In addition, the VEGFR2 expression score in prostate epithelial cells was higher in organ-confined and extra prostatic carcinoma compared to nodular prostate hyperplasia (P = 0.031 and P = 0.004, respectively). Notably, for LOX protein the immunoreactivity score was significantly higher in organ-confined carcinomas compared to nodular prostate hyperplasia (P = 0.015). The genotype-phenotype analyses showed higher LOX staining intensity for carriers of the homozygous LOX +473 G-allele (P = 0.011). Still, carriers of the KDR-604 T-allele were more prone to have higher VEGFR2 expression in prostate epithelial cells (P < 0.006).  Conclusions:   Protein expression of hypoxia markers (VEGFR2, CAIX and LOX) on prostate epithelial cells was different between malignant and benign prostate disease. Two genetic polymorphisms (LOX +473 G > A and KDR-604 T > C) were correlated with protein level, accounting for a potential gene-environment effect in the activation of hypoxia-driven pathways in prostate carcinoma.

The bioactive cargo of EVs can be shuffled between cells and consists of lipids, metabolites, proteins, and nucleic acids, including multiple RNA species from non-coding RNAs to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this study, we hypothesized that the mRNA cargo of EVs could differ based on the EV cellular origin and subpopulation analyzed.  Methods:   We isolated MVs and EXOs from PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells by differential centrifugation and compared them to EVs derived from the benign PNT2 prostate cells. The relative mRNA levels of 84 prostate cancer-related genes were investigated and validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR arrays.  Results:   Based on the mRNA abundance, MVs rather than EXOs were enriched in the analyzed transcripts, providing a snapshot of the tumor transcriptome. LNCaP MVs specifically contained significantly increased mRNA levels of NK3 Homeobox 1 (NKX3-1), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) genes, whereas PC-3 MVs carried increased mRNA levels of several genes including, caveolin-2 (CAV2), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES1), calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein 1 (CAMSAP1), zinc-finger protein 185 (ZNF185), and others compared to PNT2 MVs. Additionally, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNAs identified in LNCaP- and PC-3- derived MVs highly correlated with prostate cancer progression.

However, it is important to underline that PSA is not the ideal screening tool due to its low specificity, which leads to the possible biopsy for the patient without High-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa). Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a predictive nomogram for HGPCa in patients with PSA 4-10 ng/ml based on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2), MRI-based prostate volume (PV), MRI-based PV-adjusted Prostate Specific Antigen Density (adjusted-PSAD) and other traditional classical parameters.  Methods:   Between January 2014 and September 2015, Of 151 men who were eligible for analysis were formed the training cohort. A prediction model for HGPCa was built by using backward logistic regression and was presented on a nomogram. The prediction model was evaluated by a validation cohort between October 2015 and October 2016 (n = 74). The relationship between the nomogram-based risk-score as well as other parameters with Gleason score (GS) was evaluated. All patients underwent 12-core systematic biopsy and at least one core targeted biopsy with transrectal ultrasonographic guidance.  Results:   The multivariate analysis revealed that patient age, PI-RADS v2 score and adjusted-PSAD were independent predictors for HGPCa. Logistic regression (LR) model had a larger AUC as compared with other parameters alone. The most discriminative cutoff value for LR model was 0.36, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 87.3, 78.4, 76.3, and 90.4%, respectively and the diagnostic performance measures retained similar values in the validation cohort (AUC 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76-0.89]). For all patients with HGPCa (n = 50), adjusted-PSAD and nomogram-based risk-score were positively correlated with the GS of HGPCa in PSA gray zone (r = 0.455, P = 0.002 and r = 0.509, P = 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion:   The nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) for forecasting HGPCa is effective, which could reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with PSA 4-10 ng/ml and nomogram-based risk-score could provide a more robust parameter of assessing the aggressiveness of HGPCa in PSA gray zone.""","""['Xiang-Ke Niu', 'Jun Li', 'Susant Kumar Das', 'Yan Xiong', 'Chao-Bing Yang', 'Tao Peng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Med Imaging""","""['Developing a new PI-RADS v2-based nomogram for forecasting high-grade prostate cancer.', 'The combination of prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2) and periprostatic fat thickness on multi-parametric MRI to predict the presence of prostate cancer.', 'Could Magnetic Resonance Imaging Help to Identify the Presence of Prostate Cancer Before Initial Biopsy?

Currently, fast MC software solutions are available utilising accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs) or clusters based on central processing units (CPUs). Both platforms are expensive in terms of purchase costs and maintenance and, in case of the GPU, provide only limited scalability. In this work we propose a cloud-based MC solution, which offers high scalability of accurate photon dose calculations. The MC simulations run on a private virtual supercomputer that is formed in the cloud. Computational resources can be provisioned dynamically at low cost without upfront investment in expensive hardware. A client-server software solution has been developed which controls the simulations and transports data to and from the cloud efficiently and securely. The client application integrates seamlessly into a treatment planning system. It runs the MC simulation workflow automatically and securely exchanges simulation data with the server side application that controls the virtual supercomputer. Advanced encryption standards were used to add an additional security layer, which encrypts and decrypts patient data on-the-fly at the processor register level. We could show that our cloud-based MC framework enables near real-time dose computation. It delivers excellent linear scaling for high-resolution datasets with absolute runtimes of 1.1 seconds to 10.9 seconds for simulating a clinical prostate and liver case up to 1% statistical uncertainty. The computation runtimes include the transportation of data to and from the cloud as well as process scheduling and synchronisation overhead.

Methods:   Prostate cancer patients on AS who underwent MP-MRI with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ultrasound (US) fusion-guided biopsy were identified. Clinical and imaging variables, including the prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), number of lesions, total lesion volume, total lesion density, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score (MRI-SS), and duration between prereferral systematic and MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy sessions, were assessed. Logistic regression modeling was used to assess upgrading on MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy. A predictive model for upgrading was calculated with the significant factors identified.  Results:   Seventy-six patients were analyzed with a mean age of 62.5 years and a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5.1 ng/mL. The average duration between prereferral and MRI/US biopsies was 21 months. Twenty patients (26.32%) were upgraded. The PSAD, duration between prereferral and MRI/US biopsies, MRI-SS, and MRI total lesion density were significantly associated with upgrading. A logistic regression model using these factors to predict upgrading on confirmatory MRI/US fusion biopsy had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, whereas the AUC was 0.69 with PSA alone. On the basis of this model, a nomogram was generated, and using a probability cutoff of 22% as an indication of upgrading, it produced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of 80%, 81.25%, 57.1%, and 92.86%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The integration of MRI findings with clinical parameters can add value to a model predicting upgrading from a Gleason score of 3 + 3 = 6 in men on AS. This can potentially be used as a noninvasive approach to confirm AS patients with low-risk disease for whom biopsy may be deferred.

Data indicate that there is no association between elevated metabolic pathway proteins and PCa mortality. There are no published studies evaluating the relation between BMI and metabolic pathways with respect to PCa outcomes with a genomics approach.  Methods:   The Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database was queried for patients who had undergone prostatectomy and had BMI information available. These patients came from Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Johns Hopkins Medical Institution (JHMI); the latter provided 2 cohorts (I and II). A high-BMI group (≥30 kg/m2 ) and a low-BMI group (<25 kg/m2 ) were identified, and genomic data were interrogated for differentially expressed genes with an interquartile range filter and a Wilcoxon test. P values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate method.  Results:   A total of 477 patients with a median follow-up of 108 months had BMI information available. Two genes were found to interact with BMI in both the JHMI I cohort and the TJU cohort, but there was no statistical significance after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Aberrant metabolic gene expression was significantly correlated with distant metastases (P < .05). No relation was found between BMI and metastases or overall survival (both P values > .05).

The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an automated method for adaptation of IMPT plans to compensate for these daily tissue density variations. A two-step restoration method for 'densities-of-the-day' was created: (1) restoration of spot positions (Bragg peaks) by adapting the energy of each pencil beam to the new water equivalent path length; and (2) re-optimization of pencil beam weights by minimizing the dosimetric difference with the planned dose distribution, using a fast and exact quadratic solver. The method was developed and evaluated using 8-10 repeat CT scans of 10 prostate cancer patients. Experiments demonstrated that giving a high weight to the PTV in the re-optimization resulted in clinically acceptable restorations. For all scans we obtained V 95% ⩾ 98% and V 107% ⩽ 2%. For the bladder, the differences between the restored and the intended treatment plan were below +2 Gy and +2%-point. The rectum differences were below +2 Gy and +2%-point for 90% of the scans.

Available edema models, based on prostate volume observations, face several limitations. Therefore, patient-specific models need to be developed to accurately account for the impact of edema. In this study we present a biomechanical model developed to reproduce edema resolution patterns documented in the literature. Using the biphasic mixture theory and finite element analysis, the proposed model takes into consideration the mechanical properties of the pubic area tissues in the evolution of prostate edema. The model's computed deformations are incorporated in a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate their effect on post-operative dosimetry. The comparison of Day1 and Day30 dosimetry results demonstrates the capability of the proposed model for patient-specific dosimetry improvements, considering the edema dynamics. The proposed model shows excellent ability to reproduce previously described edema resolution patterns and was validated based on previous findings. According to our results, for a prostate volume increase of 10-20% the Day30 urethra D10 dose metric is higher by 4.2%-10.5% compared to the Day1 value. The introduction of the edema dynamics in Day30 dosimetry shows a significant global dose overestimation identified on the conventional static Day30 dosimetry.

The purpose of using the nanoparticles is to increase the therapeutic index via two synergistic effects: enhanced energy deposition within the prostate and simultaneous shielding of organs at risk from radiation escaping from the prostate. Both uniform and non-uniform concentrations of AuNP are studied. The latter are modeled considering the possibility of AuNP diffusion after the injection using brachy needles. We study two extreme cases of coaxial AuNP concentrations: centered on brachy needles and centered half-way between them. Assuming uniform distribution of 30 mg g-1 of AuNP within the prostate, we obtain a dose enhancement larger than a factor of 2 to the prostate. Non-uniform concentration of AuNP ranging from 10 mg g-1 and 66 mg g-1 were studied. The higher the concentration in a given region of the prostate the greater is the enhancement therein. We obtain the highest dose enhancement when the brachytherapy needles are coincident with AuNP injection needles but, at the same time, the regions in the tail are colder (average dose ratio of 0.7). The best enhancement uniformity is obtained with the seeds in the tail of the AuNP distribution. In both uniform and non-uniform cases the urethra and rectum receive less than 1/3 dose compared to an analog treatment without AuNP. Remarkably, employing AuNP not only significantly increases dose to the target but also decreases dose to the neighboring rectum and even urethra, which is embedded within the prostate. These are mutually interdependent effects as more enhancement leads to more shielding and vice-versa. Caution must be paid since cold spot or hot spots may be created if the AuNP concentration versus seed position is not properly distributed respect to the seed locations.""","""['D Brivio', 'P L Nguyen', 'E Sajo', 'W Ngwa', 'P Zygmanski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison of seed loading approaches in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Minimizing the number of implantation needles for prostate (125)I brachytherapy: an investigation of possibilities and implications.', 'Large-scale Retrospective Monte Carlo Dosimetric Study for Permanent Implant Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Permanent implant prostate cancer brachytherapy: 2013 state-of-the art.', 'An Overview of X-ray Photon Counting Spectral Imaging (x-CSI) with a Focus on Gold Nanoparticle Quantification in Oncology.', 'Nanomedicines: intervention in inflammatory pathways of cancer.', 'Intercomparison of Monte Carlo calculated dose enhancement ratios for gold nanoparticles irradiated by X-rays: Assessing the uncertainty and correct methodology for extended beams.', 'A detailed Monte Carlo evaluation of 192Ir dose enhancement for gold nanoparticles and comparison with experimentally measured dose enhancements.']"""

As PC is commonly multifocal, we investigated whether baseline clinical characteristics or multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) may be useful to predict the actual pathologic distribution of PC in men with intermediate- or high-risk PC, which may better inform how to deliver focused radiotherapy.  Methods:   A retrospective single-institutional study was performed on 71 consecutive men with clinically localized, intermediate- or high-risk PC who underwent mpMRI followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) from January 2012 to December 2012. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate preoperative predictors for satellite lesions. Performance characteristics of mpMRI to detect satellite lesions and the extent of prostate disease (one hemi-gland vs both) were also evaluated.  Results:   In all, 50.7% had satellite lesions on mpMRI. On RP specimen analysis, 66.2% had satellite lesions and 55.3% of these satellite lesions had pathologic Gleason score (pGS)⩾3+4. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for mpMRI detecting a satellite lesion being present in the RP specimen were 59.6%, 66.7%, 77.8%, 45.7% and 62.0%, respectively. The presence of MRI satellite lesions was the only preoperative predictor significantly associated with finding satellite lesions on final pathology (hazard ratio (HR), 2.95, P=0.040). There was agreement in 76.1% of the entire cohort for unilateral vs bilateral disease when incorporating both biopsy and mpMRI information and comparing with the RP specimen.  Conclusions:   In intermediate risk or greater PC, only the presence of mpMRI satellite lesions could predict for pathologic satellite lesions. While combining biopsy and mpMRI information may improve preoperative disease localization, the relatively high incidence of bilateral hemi-gland involvement with pGS ⩾7 satellite lesions makes it challenging to appropriately select men eligible for hemi-gland therapy.""","""['J V Hegde', 'D J Margolis', 'P-C Wang', 'R E Reiter', 'J Huang', 'M L Steinberg', 'M Kamrava']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Detection of Individual Prostate Cancer Foci via Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'The cribriform morphology impairs Gleason 7 prostate cancer lesion detection on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Ablative options for prostate cancer management.']"""

Here we develop a tool, called Treeomics, to reconstruct the phylogeny of metastases and map subclones to their anatomic locations. Treeomics infers comprehensive seeding patterns for pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Moreover, Treeomics correctly disambiguates true seeding patterns from sequencing artifacts; 7% of variants were misclassified by conventional statistical methods. These artifacts can skew phylogenies by creating illusory tumour heterogeneity among distinct samples.

Our purpose was to determine if reduced-dose salvage brachytherapy could achieve high rates of biochemical control with acceptable toxicity if combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods and materials:   Thirty-three consecutive patients with LR after EBRT were treated with salvage brachytherapy plus ADT from 1998 to 2013. All had pathologically confirmed LR, disease-free interval ≥18 months after EBRT, no distant/nodal metastasis, and International Prostate Symptom Score ≤15. Whole-gland salvage treatment was delivered using low-dose-rate (median 100 Gy with 103Pd, n = 25) or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (30 Gy in 6 fractions over 4 weeks, n = 8) plus 4-6 months of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant ADT.  Results:   Fifty-five percent had high-risk disease at diagnosis. Median EBRT dose was 70.2 Gy; median prostate-specific antigen nadir was 0.8 ng/mL. Median time to recurrence was 56 months; median presalvage prostate-specific antigen was 5.0 ng/mL. Median postbrachytherapy followup was 61 months (range 7-150 months). Five and 7-year relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were 79% and 67%; 93% and 86%; and 94% and 85%, respectively. Freedom from late Grade 3 GU toxicity at 5 years was 85%. There were no late Grade ≥2 GI toxicities.  Conclusions:   This is the largest series of salvage brachytherapy combined with neoadjuvant plus adjuvant ADT and uses reduced-dose brachytherapy. Results suggest that reduced-dose salvage brachytherapy is feasible and reasonably well tolerated when combined with ADT.

On average, 47% of the respondents replied ""Don't Know"" to the questions. Overall, PC knowledge scores were low among these young Black men, especially in domains related to risk factors, screening age guidelines, limitations, and diet. It is thus important that these men be educated more on these important domains of prostate cancer and screening so that the decision to screen or not will be an informed one.

However, unambiguous physiochemical markers of DNA damage from carcinogens derived from cooked meats, such as DNA adducts, have not been identified in human samples to support this paradigm. We have developed a highly sensitive nano-LC-Orbitrap MS n method to measure DNA adducts of several carcinogens originating from well-done cooked meats, tobacco smoke, and environmental pollution, including 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP). The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the major deoxyguanosine (dG) adducts of these carcinogens ranged between 1.3 and 2.2 adducts per 10 9 nucleotides per 2.5 μg of DNA assayed. The DNA adduct of PhIP, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-PhIP (dG-C8-PhIP) was identified in 11 out of 35 patients, at levels ranging from 2 to 120 adducts per 10 9 nucleotides. The dG-C8 adducts of AαC and MeIQx, and the B[a]P adduct, 10-(deoxyguanosin-N 2 -yl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (dG-N 2 -B[a]PDE) were not detected in any specimen, whereas N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP (dG-C8-4-ABP) was identified in one subject (30 adducts per 10 9 nucleotides). PhIP-DNA adducts also were recovered quantitatively from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, signifying FFPE tissues can serve as biospecimens for carcinogen DNA adduct biomarker research. Our biomarker data provide support to the epidemiological observations implicating PhIP, one of the most mass-abundant heterocyclic aromatic amines formed in well-done cooked meats, as a DNA-damaging agent that may contribute to the etiology of prostate cancer.""","""['Shun Xiao', 'Jingshu Guo', 'Byeong Hwa Yun', 'Peter W Villalta', 'Suprita Krishna', 'Resha Tejpaul', 'Paari Murugan', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Robert J Turesky']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Targeted and Untargeted Detection of DNA Adducts of Aromatic Amine Carcinogens in Human Bladder by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.', 'Identification of carcinogen DNA adducts in human saliva by linear quadrupole ion trap/multistage tandem mass spectrometry.', ""Novel LC-ESI/MS/MS(n) method for the characterization and quantification of 2'-deoxyguanosine adducts of the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine by 2-D linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry."", 'Identification of new mutagenic heterocyclic amines and quantification of known heterocyclic amines.', 'Multi-DNA Adduct and Abasic Site Quantitation In Vivo by Nano-Liquid Chromatography/High-Resolution Orbitrap Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Methodology for Biomonitoring Colorectal DNA Damage.', 'Detection of DNA adducts derived from the tobacco carcinogens, benzoapyrene and dibenzodef,pchrysene in human oral buccal cells.', 'The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Metabolism and biomarkers of heterocyclic aromatic amines in humans.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of DNA Adducts Using Data-Independent wSIM/MS2 Acquisition and wSIM-City.']"""

Patients and methods:   Our study population included 160 211 men aged ≥40 years with at least one visit to a primary care clinic in any of the study years in a large, integrated health system. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data from January 2007 to December 2014. Yearly rates of screening PSA testing by primary care providers (PCPs), rates of re-screening, and rates of prostate biopsies were assessed.  Results:   Annual PSA-screening testing declined from 2007 to 2014 in all age groups, as did biennial and quadrennial screening. Yearly rates declined for men aged ≥70 years, from 22.8% to 8.9%; ages 50-69 years, from 39.2% to 20%; and ages 40-49 years, from 11% to 4.6%. Overall rates were lower for African-American (A-A) men vs non-A-A men; for men with a family history of prostate cancer, rates were similar or slightly higher than for those without a family history. PCP variation associated with ordering of PSA testing did not substantially change after the USPSTF recommendations. While the number of men screened and rates of follow-up prostate cancer screening declined in 2011-2014 compared to 2007-2010, similar re-screening rates were noted for men aged 45-75 years with initial PSA levels of <1 ng/mL or 1-3 ng/mL in both the earlier and later cohorts. For men aged >75 years with initial PSA levels of <3 ng/mL screened in both cohorts, follow-up screening rates were similar. Rates of prostate biopsy declined for men aged ≥70 years in 2014 compared to 2007. For men who had PSA screening, rates of first prostate biopsy increased in later years for A-A men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer screening declined from 2007 to 2014 even in higher-risk groups and follow-up screening rates were not related to previous PSA level. However, rates of first prostate biopsy in men who were screened with a PSA test were higher for men with an increased risk of prostate cancer in later years. Variation in PSA testing was noted among PCPs.

Anatomical recurrence patterns were classified as lymphotrophic (lymph nodes only), osteotrophic (bone only), or multifocal if both were present. Isolated first failure sites were defined as sites of initial clinically detected recurrence that remained isolated for at least 3 months.  Results:   The median follow-up after SRT was 6.8 years. The 8-year rates of local, regional, and distant failure for patients undergoing SRT were 2%, 6%, and 21%, respectively. Of the 22% men (128 of 574) who developed a clinically detectable recurrence, 17%, 50%, and 31% were lymphotrophic, osteotrophic, and multifocal, respectively.

The aim of this study was to assess the intensity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in the primary tumour and metastases in patients with biopsy-proven PC prior to therapy, and to determine whether a correlation exists between the primary tumour-related 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation and the Gleason score (GS) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  Methods:   Ninety patients with transrectal ultrasound biopsy-proven PC (GS 6-10; median PSA: 9.7 ng/ml) referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were retrospectively analysed. PET images were analysed visually and semiquantitatively by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The SUVmax of the primary tumour and pathologic lesions suspicious for lymphatic or distant metastases were then compared to the physiologic background activity of normal prostate tissue and gluteal muscle. The SUVmax of the primary tumour was assessed in relation to both PSA level and GS.  Results:   Eighty-two patients (91.1%) demonstrated pathologic tracer accumulation in the primary tumour that exceeded physiologic tracer uptake in normal prostate tissue (median SUVmax: 12.5 vs. 3.9). Tumours with GS of 6, 7a (3+4) and 7b (4+3) showed significantly lower 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, with median SUVmax of 5.9, 8.3 and 8.2, respectively, compared to patients with GS >7 (median SUVmax: 21.2; p < 0.001). PC patients with PSA ≥10.0 ng/ml exhibited significantly higher uptake than those with PSA levels <10.0 ng/ml (median SUVmax: 17.6 versus 7.7; p < 0.001). In 24 patients (26.7%), 82 lymph nodes with pathologic tracer accumulation consistent with metastases were detected (median SUVmax: 10.6). Eleven patients (12.2%) revealed 55 pathologic osseous lesions suspicious for bone metastases (median SUVmax: 11.6).  Conclusions:   The GS and PSA level correlated with the intensity of tracer accumulation in the primary tumours of PC patients on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. As PC tumours with GS 6+7 and patients with PSA values ≤10 ng/ml showed significantly lower 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT should be preferentially applied for primary staging of PC in patients with GS >7 or PSA levels ≥10 ng/ml.""","""['Christian Uprimny', 'Alexander Stephan Kroiss', 'Clemens Decristoforo', 'Josef Fritz', 'Elisabeth von Guggenberg', 'Dorota Kendler', 'Lorenza Scarpa', 'Gianpaolo di Santo', 'Llanos Geraldo Roig', 'Johanna Maffey-Steffan', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Irene Johanna Virgolini']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Retrospective correlation of 68ga-psma uptake with clinical parameters in prostate cancer patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy.', 'Biodistribution of (68)GaPSMA-HBED-CC in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Characterization of Uptake in Normal Organs and Tumour Lesions.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Higher Preoperative Maximum Standardised Uptake Values (SUVmax) Are Associated with Higher Biochemical Recurrence Rates after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FDCFPyL Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography.', 'PI-RADS-Based Segmented Threshold of PSMA-PET SUVmax Is Better than Traditional Fixed Threshold for Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Especially for PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'Impact of non-regional lymph node metastases accurately revealed on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in the clinical management of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

African American (AA) men are disproportionately affected by both prostate cancer (PCa) and vitamin D deficiency compared with European American (EA) men. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased PCa aggressiveness and mortality. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the PCa disparity between AA and EA men. METHODS. We studied a cross sectional group of 60 PCa patients (AA, n = 31; EA, n = 29) who underwent radical prostatectomy. Vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) were measured in the serum and tissue by uHPLC-MS-MS. Tissue was laser capture microdissected, and gene expression was quantified by microarray. DNA isolated from whole blood was genotyped for West African ancestry markers and vitamin D-related SNPs. RESULTS. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were lower in AAs, but concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D in the prostate tissue were higher compared with EAs. Expression of the vitamin D receptor was higher in prostate tissue from AAs. Expression of the extracellular receptor of vitamin D binding protein, LRP2, was positively associated with West African ancestry and inversely associated with tissue 25(OH)D concentrations in AAs. CONCLUSIONS. The relationships between vitamin D binding protein LRP2 and vitamin D metabolites suggest that the prohormone is actively transported into the prostate, followed by intraprostatic conversion to the active hormone, rather than passive diffusion. These findings support the presence of a compensatory response in prostate tissue to vitamin D deficiency in AAs and reveal a previously unknown complexity involving tissue distribution of vitamin D metabolites.

Several metabolites, which deserve special attention in the further metabolomic investigations on searching for prostate cancer markers, were indicated. Moreover, free amino acid profiles enabled to classify samples to one of the studied groups with high sensitivity and specificity.

In this study, the cell-death metabolism of biseugenol B was investigated. Nuclear condensation, cell permeability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and release of cytochrome c have been detected in human prostate cancer cell line (PC3) treated with biseugenol B by high content screening (HCS). Fluorescent analysis was conducted to examine the reactive oxygen species formation. To determine the mechanism of cell death, the levels of Bcl-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 proteins, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein and anti-apoptosis heat-shock protein 70 were tested by applying reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Bioluminescent assays were also performed to assess the level of caspases such as 3/7, 8 and 9 during treatment. Furthermore, the involvement of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) was examined by Western blot and HCS. Biseugenol B showed significant cytotoxicity toward PC3 with no toxicity toward normal prostate cells (RWPE-1), which indicates that biseugenol B has qualities that induce apoptosis in tumor cells. The treatment of PC3 cells with biseugenol B provoked apoptosis with cell-death-transducing signals. Downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax regulated the MMP, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol. The release of cytochrome c activated caspase-9, which consequently activated caspase-3/7 with the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein, thereby resulting in apoptosis alteration. Involvement of an extrinsic apoptosis pathway was exhibited by the increase in caspase-8, while the increase in caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 demonstrated involvement of an intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, no significant increase was observed in caspases 3/7, 8 or 9 in normal prostate cells (RWPE-1) after treatment with biseugenol B. Prevention of NF-κB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus occurred in PC3 after treatment with biseugenol B. The results of our study reveal that biseugenol B triggers the apoptosis of PC3 cells via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways and inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that biseugenol B is a potentially useful agent for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Maryam Abbaspour Babaei', 'Hasniza Zaman Huri', 'Behnam Kamalidehghan', 'Swee Keong Yeap', 'Fatemeh Ahmadipour']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['α-Mangostin from Cratoxylum arborescens demonstrates apoptogenesis in MCF-7 with regulation of NF-κB and Hsp70 protein modulation in vitro, and tumor reduction in vivo.', 'Involvement of NF-κB and Bcl2/Bax signaling pathways in the apoptosis of MCF7 cells induced by a xanthone compound Pyranocycloartobiloxanthone A.', 'Involvement of NF-κB and HSP70 signaling pathways in the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by a prenylated xanthone compound, α-mangostin, from Cratoxylum arborescens.', 'Signaling of cell death and cell survival following focal cerebral ischemia: life and death struggle in the penumbra.', 'Apoptosis: programmed cell death at a molecular level.', 'The Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) Induces Apoptosis, Autophagy and Cell Cycle Arrest in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Corema album Leaves Mediate DNA Damage in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'MicroRNA-1246 Mediates Drug Resistance and Metastasis in Breast Cancer by Targeting NFE2L3.', 'Effects of zinc on tissue uptake and toxicity of lead in Sprague Dawley rat.', 'Prostate Apoptotic Induction and NFκB Suppression by Dammarolic Acid: Mechanistic Insight into Onco-Therapeutic Action of an Aglycone Asiaticoside.']"""

Here, we explore an approach to identify potential synthetic-lethal interactions by screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns in cancer genomes. We sought to identify 'synthetic-essential' genes: those that are occasionally deleted in some cancers but are almost always retained in the context of a specific tumour-suppressor deficiency. We also posited that such synthetic-essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic-lethal interactions, this approach uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor CHD1 as a putative synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancers. In PTEN-deficient prostate and breast cancers, CHD1 depletion profoundly and specifically suppressed cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency results in stabilization of CHD1, which in turn engages the trimethyl lysine-4 histone H3 modification to activate transcription of the pro-tumorigenic TNF-NF-κB gene network.

Blood samples were collected from 10 healthy individuals and 22 patients with different types of cancer. The whole blood cells were isolated using enrichment protocols and the DNA and RNA were extracted. RT-qPCR was performed for L1-ORF1 (open reading frame 1) and L1-ORF2, using 18S rRNA as the reference gene. The data were analyzed with the Livak method and statistical analyses were carried out with the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. In parallel with the above molecular biology experiments, FISH experiments were performed on the interphase nuclei of the cells for the detection of ORF2 RNA. DNA analysis revealed the presence of both ORF1 and ORF2 in all samples. RNA expression experiments demonstrated that ORF1 was not expressed in all samples, while ORF2 was expressed at varying levels in the non-cancer samples and the samples representing the different cancer types. A significant difference in ORF2 expression was observed between the CTCs and non-cancer samples (p = 0,00043), and significant differences were also observed between normal and lung (p = 0,034), pancreatic (p = 0,022), prostate (p = 0,014), and unknown primary of origin (p = 0,0039) cancer samples.

We investigated the impact of setup and anatomy variations on the anterior-oblique (AO) proton plan dose, and strategies to manage these effects via range verification and adaptive delivery. Ten patients treated by bilateral (BL) passive-scattering proton therapy (79.2 Gy in 44 fractions) who underwent weekly verification CT scans were selected. Plans with AO beams were additionally created. To isolate the effect of daily variations, initial AO plans did not include range uncertainty margins. The use of fixed planning margins and adaptive range adjustments to manage these effects was investigated. For each case, the planned dose was recalculated on weekly CTs, and accumulated on the simulation CT using deformable registration to approximate the delivered dose. Planned and accumulated doses were compared for each scenario to quantify dose deviations induced by variations. The possibility of estimating the necessary range adjustments before each treatment was explored by simulating the procedure of a diode-based in vivo range verification technique, which would potentially be used clinically. The average planned rectum, penile bulb and femoral heads mean doses were smaller for initial AO compared to BL plans (by 8.3, 16.1 and 25.9 Gy, respectively). After considering interfractional variations in AO plans, the target coverage was substantially reduced. The maximum reduction of V 79.2/D 95/D mean/EUD for AO (without distal margins) (25.3%/10.7/1.6/4.9 Gy, respectively) was considerably larger than BL plans. The loss of coverage was mainly related to changes in water equivalent path length of the prostate after fiducial-based setup, caused by discrepancies in patient anterior surface and bony-anatomy alignment. Target coverage was recovered partially when using fixed planning margins, and fully when applying adaptive range adjustments. The accumulated organs-at-risk dose for AO beams after range adjustment demonstrated full sparing of femoral heads and superior sparing of penile bulb and rectum compared to the conventional BL cases. Our study indicates that using AO beams makes prostate treatment more susceptible to target underdose induced by interfractional variations. Adaptive range verification/adjustment may facilitate the use of anterior beam approaches, and ensure adequate target coverage in every fraction of the treatment.""","""['M Moteabbed', 'A Trofimov', 'G C Sharp', 'Y Wang', 'A L Zietman', 'J A Efstathiou', 'H-M Lu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Hydrogel rectum-prostate spacers mitigate the uncertainties in proton relative biological effectiveness associated with anterior-oblique beams.', 'A Prospective Comparison of the Effects of Interfractional Variations on Proton Therapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Degradation of target coverage due to inter-fraction motion during intensity-modulated proton therapy of prostate and elective targets.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Imaging issues specific to hadrontherapy (proton, carbon, helium therapy and other charged particles) for radiotherapy planning, setup, dose monitoring and tissue response assessment.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric comparison of robust angles in carbon-ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy Using Metal Artifact Reduction Computed Tomography in a Patient with Prostate Cancer with Bilateral Hip Prostheses: A Case Report.', 'Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Ultra-Hypofractionated Proton Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer: Passive Scattering versus Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between March 2013 and February 2015, 175 men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) were offered bpMRI (NCT01864135) based on a suspicion of PCa (two repeated PSA measurements in the range 2.5-20.0 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examination). Men with an equivocal to high suspicion of PCa had two TBs of the dominant lesion using cognitive ultrasound guidance, followed by systematic biopsy (SB). Men with a low to very low suspicion had only SB. In total, 161 (161/175, 92%) prospectively enrolled men completed the trial and were included in the final analyses. The primary endpoint of the trial was the cancer detection rate (CDR) of TB and SB. Clinically significant cancer (SPCa) was defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4.  Results:   TB compared with SB had higher CDR for SPCa (45%, 72/161 vs. 39%, 63/161, respectively; P > 0.05) and a lower CDR for Gleason score 3 + 3 (8%, 15/161 vs. 16%, 30/161; P < 0.05).

HIF-1α regulates several target genes involved in many aspects of cancer progression, including angiogenesis, metastasis, anti-apoptosis and cell proliferation as well as imparts resistance to cancer treatment. In this study, we assessed Crataegus Pinnatifida Bunge var. typical Schneider ethanol extract (CPE) for its anti-cancer effects in hypoxia-induced DU145 human prostate cancer cell line. CPE decreased the abundance of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK-1) in hypoxia-induced prostate cancer DU145 cells. CPE decreased HIF-1α and SPHK-1 as well as SPHK-1 activity. Chlorogenic acid (CA) is one of four major compounds of CPE. Compared to CPE, CA significantly decreased the expression of HIF-1α and SPHK-1 as well as SPHK-1 activity in hypoxia-induced DU145 cells. Furthermore, CA decreased phosphorylation AKT and GSK-3β, which are associated with HIF-1α stabilization and affected SPHK-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. We confirmed the mechanism of CA-induced inhibition of HIF-1α by SPHK-1 signaling pathway using SPHK-1 siRNA and SPHK inhibitor (SKI). CA decreased the secretion and cellular expression of VEGF, thus inhibiting hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Treatment of DU145cells with SPHK1 siRNA and CA for 48 h decreased cancer cell growth, and the inhibitory action of SPHK siRNA and CA on cell growth was confirmed by decrease in the abundance of Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).""","""['Myoung-Sun Lee', 'Seon-Ok Lee', 'Kyu-Ri Kim', 'Hyo-Jeong Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Sphingosine kinase 1 pathway is involved in melatonin-induced HIF-1α inactivation in hypoxic PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Anti-cancer effect of pristimerin by inhibition of HIF-1α involves the SPHK-1 pathway in hypoxic prostate cancer cells.', 'Chlorogenic acid inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis via down-regulation of the HIF-1α/AKT pathway.', 'When the sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1-phosphate pathway meets hypoxia signaling: new targets for cancer therapy.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factors and sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling.', 'AKT, a Key Transmitter of HIF-1α and AR Signaling Pathways, Has a Critical Role in the Apigetrin-Mediated Anti-Cancer Effects in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Insights into forsythia honeysuckle (Lianhuaqingwen) capsules: A Chinese herbal medicine repurposed for COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Combinatorial Effects of the Natural Products Arctigenin, Chlorogenic Acid, and Cinnamaldehyde Commit Oxidation Assassination on Breast Cancer Cells.', 'A prospective trial of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in Black and White men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', ""Compounds with Antiviral, Anti-Inflammatory and Anticancer Activity Identified in Wine from Hungary's Tokaj Region via High Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Bioinformatics Analyses.""]"""

Twenty men with biopsy-proven Gleason 3 + 3 prostate cancer and 3 T mpMRI were studied. Ten patients (Tx) had been receiving 5-ARIs for at least a year at scan time. Ten untreated patients (Un) were matched to the treated cohort. For each subject two regions of interest representing cancerous and benign tissues were drawn within the peripheral zone of each prostate, MR measures evaluated, and cancer contrast versus benign (contrast = (MRTumor - MRHealthy )/MRHealthy ) calculated. Decreased cancer contrast was noted on T2 -weighted images: 0.4 (Un) versus 0.3 (Tx). However, for functional MR measures, a better separation of cancerous and benign tissues was observed in the treated group. Cancer contrast on high-b diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was 0.61 (Un) versus 0.99 (Tx). Logistic regression analysis yielded higher AUC (area under the curve) values for distinguishing cancerous from benign regions in treated subjects on high-b DWI (0.71 (Un), 0.94 (Tx)), maximal enhancement slope (0.95 (Un), 1 (Tx)), peak enhancement (0.84 (Un), 0.93 (Tx)), washout slope (0.78 (Un), 0.99 (Tx)), Ktrans (0.9 (Un), 1 (Tx)), and combined measures (0.86 (Un), 0.99 (Tx)). Coefficients of variation for MR measures were lower in benign and cancerous tissues in the treated group compared with the untreated group. This study's results suggest an increase in homogeneity of benign and malignant peripheral zone prostatic tissues with 5-ARI exposure, observed as reduced variability of MR measures after treatment.

In addition, a role of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways in mediating these effects was explored. We have demonstrated that in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells HF induced rapid increase of E-cadherin phosphorylation at Ser 838/840 (p<0.05) in MAPK/ERK1/2-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr 654 was unchanged.

In androgen-independent PC3 cells HF decreased Tyr 860 N-cadherin and Tyr 645 β-catenin phosphorylation (p<0.01), acting via both MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Further, we evidenced that MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways were differentially influenced by HF in LNCaP and PC3 cells. In LNCaP cells, both Akt (p<0.01) and ERK1/2 (p<0.001) phosphorylation were negatively regulated and this effect was mediated by Raf-1 (p<0.05). In contrast, in PC3 cells HF stimulated Akt (p<0.001) and ERK1/2 (p<0.001) activation, but had no effect on the crosstalk between PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways at the Raf-1 kinase level.

We examined whether prostate cancer treatment differed for men with IBD, and whether treatment choice was associated with risk of IBD flare.  Materials and methods:   Using Veterans Health Administration cancer registry and administrative data, we identified 52,311 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2005 to 2008. We used International Classification of Diseases-9 codes and pharmacy and utilization data to identify IBD diagnoses, IBD-directed therapy, and flares (glucocorticoid escalation, hospitalization, and surgical intervention). We compared characteristics across men with and without IBD, and used multivariable regression to examine IBD flares after treatment according to treatment type.  Results:   Two hundred and forty men (0.5%) had IBD prior to prostate cancer diagnosis. Compared to non-IBD patients, IBD patients were more likely Caucasian (P < .001) with lower-risk cancer (P = .02). Surgery was more common in IBD patients (41% vs 28%, P < .001). In the year following prostate cancer treatment, 18% of IBD patients experienced flares. After adjustment, the only predictor of flare in the year after treatment was flare in the year prior to treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 12.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.4-29.2).  Conclusion:   IBD patients were more likely to have lower-risk disease and be treated with surgery. Choice of prostate cancer treatment did not predict flares in the subsequent year.

A genitourinary pathologist rereviewed tumor foci for Gleason architectural subtype. Each prostate imaging reporting and data system category 3 to 5 lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was paired with its corresponding pathological tumor focus. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine predictors of tumor visibility.  Results:   Of the 83 tumor foci identified 26 (31%) were visible on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, 33 (40%) were Gleason score 3+3 and 50 (60%) were Gleason score 3+4 or greater. Among tumor foci containing Gleason pattern 4, increasing tumor size and noncribriform predominant architecture were the only independent predictors of tumor detection on multivariable analysis (p = 0.002 and p = 0.011, respectively). For tumor foci containing Gleason pattern 4, 0.5 cm or greater, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging detected 10 of 13 (77%), 5 of 14 (36%) and 9 of 10 (90%) for poorly formed, cribriform and fused architecture, respectively (p = 0.01). The size threshold for the detection of cribriform tumors was higher than that of other architectural patterns. Furthermore, cribriform pattern was identified more frequently on systematic biopsy than on targeted biopsy.

If updated into the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC Rotterdam) risk calculator number 3 (RC3), this may further improve upfront selection of men who need a biopsy.  Objective:   To improve the number of possible biopsies avoided, while limiting undiagnosed clinically important PCa by applying the updated RC3 for risk-based patient selection.  Design, setting, and participants:   The RC3 is based on the first screening round of the ERSPC Rotterdam, which involved 3616 men. In 2015, histopathologic slides for PCa cases (n=885) were re-evaluated. Low-risk (LR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 1 or 2 without CR/IDC. High-risk (HR) PCa was defined as ISUP grade 2 with CR/IDC and PCa with ISUP grade≥3.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We updated the RC3 using multinomial logistic regression analysis, including data on age, PSA, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume, for predicting LR and HR PCa. Predictive accuracy was quantified using receiver operating characteristic analysis and decision curve analysis.  Results and limitations:   Men without PCa could effectively be distinguished from men with LR PCa and HR PCa (area under the curve 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.72 and 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94). At a 1% risk threshold, the updated calculator would lead to a 34% reduction in unnecessary biopsies, while only 2% of HR PCa cases would be undiagnosed.  Conclusions:   A relatively simple risk stratification tool augmented with a highly sensitive contemporary pathologic biopsy classification would result in a considerable decrease in unnecessary prostate biopsies and overdiagnosis of potentially indolent disease.  Patient summary:   We improved a well-known prostate risk calculator with a new pathology classification system that better reflects disease burden. This new risk calculator allows individualized prediction of the chance of having (potentially aggressive) biopsy-detectable prostate cancer and can guide shared decision-making when considering prostate biopsy.""","""['Monique J Roobol', 'Jan F M Verbeek', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Intan P Kümmerlin', 'Charlotte F Kweldam', 'Geert J L H van Leenders']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Novel Definitions of Low-risk and High-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Tool.', 'Prediction of High-grade Prostate Cancer Following Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving the Rotterdam European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators.', 'Reducing unnecessary biopsies while detecting clinically significant prostate cancer including cribriform growth with the ERSPC Rotterdam risk calculator and 4Kscore.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Feasibility and accuracy of prostate cancer risk calculators in prediction of prostate cancer, extraprostatic extension as well as the risk of lymph nodes metastasis.', 'Common errors, pitfalls, and management of complications of prostate biopsy : The most common diagnostic and procedural challenges of transrectal fusion prostate biopsy in the initial diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Predictive Models in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.', 'Prostate Cancer: Is There Still a Role for Systematic Biopsies?

Materials and methods:   457 prostate cancer patients who underwent 3T phased-array coil prostate MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; maximal b-value 1000 s/mm2) before prostatectomy were included. Mean ADC of a single dominant lesion was measured in each patient, using histopathologic findings from the prostatectomy specimen as reference. In subsets defined by race and age, ADC values were compared between Gleason score (GS) ≤ 3 + 4 and GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors.

We report the molecular basis of DNA-binding autoinhibition of ETS transcription factors ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5, which are often overexpressed in prostate cancer. Inhibitory elements that cooperate to repress DNA binding were identified in regions N- and C-terminal of the ETS domain. Crystal structures of these three factors revealed an α-helix in the C-terminal inhibitory domain that packs against the ETS domain and perturbs the conformation of its DNA-recognition helix. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID) is intrinsically disordered, yet utilizes transient intramolecular interactions with the DNA-recognition helix of the ETS domain to mediate autoinhibition. Acetylation of selected lysines within the NID activates DNA binding. This investigation revealed a distinctive mechanism for DNA-binding autoinhibition in the ETV1/4/5 subfamily involving a network of intramolecular interactions not present in other ETS factors.

Methods and materials: 125I sources were manually identified in the postimplant ultrasound images and compared to the preoperative plan. Due to the subjective nature of the identifying sources, only sources identified with high confidence were included in the analysis. Misplacements from the original intended coordinate were measured along the X, Y, and Z axes and were stratified between overall misplacements and regions of the prostate gland.  Results:   A total of 1619 125I sources using 357 strands were implanted in 15 patients' prostate glands, with 1197 (74%) confidently identified for misplacement analysis. The overall mean displacement was 0.49 cm and in the X, Y, and Z direction was 0.13, 0.15, and 0.38 cm, respectively. Greater source misplacement occurred in the anterior part of the prostate gland than the posterior part of the prostate gland by a factor 1.33 (p < 0.0001). Comparing sources in the lateral vs. medial regions of the prostate, no statistically significant differences on source misplacement were observed.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 890 patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer via multicore (12 or more) biopsy at our institution. Unfavorable disease was defined as primary Gleason pattern 4 or greater, or pathological stage T3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with unfavorable disease. The association of unfavorable disease with anatomical location of the index tumor was assessed.  Results:   Overall 216 (24.3%), 544 (61.1%) and 130 men (14.6%) had a body mass index of less than 23 (normal), 23 to 27.5 (overweight) and 27.5 kg/m2 or greater (obese), respectively, according to established cutoff points for Asian men. Multivariate analysis showed that age, prostate volume and body mass index were independent factors for predicting unfavorable disease regardless of the various active surveillance criteria used. For Johns Hopkins Hospital criteria the risk of unfavorable disease was higher in obese patients than in normal weight patients (OR 3.30, p = 0.022). Unfavorable disease was more frequent in cases of transition zone cancer than nontransition zone cancer across all criteria for active surveillance (all p <0.01). Among men fulfilling Johns Hopkins Hospital criteria the proportion of transition zone cancer was 4.2% for normal weight, 11.6% for overweight and 16.7% for obesity, respectively (p = 0.022).

However, the validity of several such associations is still under debate, including its effect on pathological stage at radical prostatectomy (RP) and subsequent biochemical recurrence (BCR), which represents the focus of this study.  Methods:   We relied on patients with PCa treated with RP at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center between 2004 and 2015. First, multivariable logistic regression analyses tested for association between obesity and non-organ-confined disease (≥pT3 or pN1). Second, multivariable Cox regression analyses examined obesity effect on BCR. Last, in a propensity score-matched cohort, Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed BCR-free survival according to body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI) strata (≥30 vs.<25).  Results:   Of 16,014 individuals, 2,403 (15%) men were obese (BMI≥30). Median follow-up was 36.4 months (interquartile range: 13.3-60.8). Obese patients were more likely to harbor non-organ-confined disease at final pathology (odds ratio = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.13-1.43; P<0.001) but did not have higher BCR rates (hazard ratio = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.86-1.11; P = 0.7). Similarly, BCR-free survival was not different between obese and nonobese men, after propensity score matching (log rank P = 0.9).  Conclusion:   Obesity (BMI ≥30) might predispose to higher rates of non-organ-confined disease at RP. However, obesity was not an independent predictor of BCR after surgery. Consequently, the unfavorable effect of obesity on PCa might be limited to local spread of the disease and might be neutralized after RP.""","""['Jonas Schiffmann', 'Georg Salomon', 'Derya Tilki', 'Lars Budäus', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Sami-Ramzi Leyh-Bannurah', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Alexander Haese', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre Tennstedt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Obesity paradox in prostate cancer: increased body mass index was associated with decreased risk of metastases after surgery in 13,667 patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Patterns and predictors of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy in men with pT3N0 prostate cancer: implications for multimodal therapies.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: what does it mean?', 'Perineural invasion as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Association of Obesity With Survival Outcomes in Patients With Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Post-Diagnostic Dietary and Lifestyle Factors and Prostate Cancer Recurrence, Progression, and Mortality.', 'How radical prostatectomy procedures have changed over the last 10\xa0years in Italy: a comparative analysis based on more than 1500 patients participating in the MIRROR-SIU/LUNA and the Pros-IT CNR study.', 'Surgical site infections after radical prostatectomy: A comparative study between robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and retropubic radical prostatectomy.']"""

Although a few studies have reported an association between high serum ferritin levels and an increased risk of prostate cancer, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a large case-control study consisting of 2002 prostate cancer patients and 951 control patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We found that high ferritin levels were positively associated with increased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and prostate cancer risk; each 100 ng/ml increase in serum ferritin increased the odds ratio (OR) by 1.20 (95% CI: 1.13-1.36). In the prostate cancer group, increased serum ferritin levels were significantly correlated with higher Gleason scores (p < 0.001). Notably, serum PSA values had even higher predictive accuracy among prostate cancer patients with serum ferritin levels > 400 ng/ml (Gleason score + total PSA correlation: r = 0.38; Gleason score + free PSA correlation: r = 0.49). Moreover, using immunohistochemistry, we found that prostate tissue ferritin levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in prostate cancer patients (n = 129) compared to BPH controls (n = 31).

Importantly, we found no correlation between serum ferritin levels and the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) in prostate cancer patients.

Results:   Using published PSA density and PSA mass density cutoff values, men with higher body mass indices and prostate weights were less likely to have a tumor volume <0.5 cm3. Variability across race/ethnicity was found in the univariable analysis for all PSA derivatives when predicting for tumor volume. In receiver operator characteristic analysis, area under the curve values for all PSA derivatives varied across race/ethnicity with lower optimal cutoff values for Hispanic/Latino (PSA=2.79, PSA density=0.06, PSA mass=0.37, PSA mass density=0.011) and Non-Hispanic Black (PSA=3.75, PSA density=0.07, PSA mass=0.46, PSA mass density=0.008) compared to Non-Hispanic White men (PSA=4.20, PSA density=0.11 PSA mass=0.53, PSA mass density=0.014).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 589 patients with low-risk prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy. Pre-operative PSA, patient height, body weight, and prostate weight were used to calculate all PSA derivatives. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each PSA derivative per racial/ethnic group to establish optimal cutoff values predicting for tumor volume ≥0.5 cm3.  Conclusions:   Increasing prostate weight and body mass index negatively influence PSA derivatives for predicting tumor volume. PSA derivatives' ability to predict tumor volume varies significantly across race/ethnicity. Hispanic/Latino and Non-Hispanic Black men have lower optimal cutoff values for all PSA derivatives, which may impact risk assessment for prostate cancer.""","""['Felix M Chinea', 'Kirill Lyapichev', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Deukwoo Kwon', 'Paul Taylor Smith', 'Alan Pollack', 'Richard J Cote', 'Oleksandr N Kryvenko']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['African-American men with prostate cancer have larger tumor volume than Caucasian men despite no difference in serum prostate specific antigen.', 'Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Tumor Characteristics and Treatments in Favorable and Unfavorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Is Hispanic race an independent risk factor for pathological stage in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy?', 'Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Race and serum prostate-specific antigen levels: current status and future directions.', 'Racial Disparities and Mental Health Effects Within Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer upgrading and adverse pathology in Hispanic men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Optimization of training and measurement protocol for eNose analysis of urine headspace aimed at prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Potential effect of anti-inflammatory drug use on PSA kinetics and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis: Risk stratification in black and white men with benign prostate biopsy.', ""Perspectives on ethnic and racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: Update and areas of immediate need.""]"""

The purpose of this article was to describe and validate an automatic needle segmentation algorithm designed for HDR-BT, specifically capable of simultaneously segmenting all needles in an HDR-BT implant using a single SR3D image with ~5 mm interneedle spacing.  Materials and methods:   The segmentation algorithm involves regularized feature point classification and line trajectory identification based on the randomized 3D Hough transform modified to handle multiple straight needles in a single image simultaneously. Needle tips are identified based on peaks in the derivative of the signal intensity profile along the needle trajectory. For algorithm validation, 12 prostate cancer patients underwent HDR-BT during which SR3D images were acquired with all needles in place. Needles present in each of the 12 images were segmented manually, providing a gold standard for comparison, and using the algorithm. Tip errors were assessed in terms of the 3D Euclidean distance between needle tips, and trajectory error was assessed in terms of 2D distance in the axial plane and angular deviation between trajectories.  Results:   In total, 190 needles were investigated. Mean execution time of the algorithm was 11.0 s per patient, or 0.7 s per needle. The algorithm identified 82% and 85% of needle tips with 3D errors ≤3 mm and ≤5 mm, respectively, 91% of needle trajectories with 2D errors in the axial plane ≤3 mm, and 83% of needle trajectories with angular errors ≤3°. The largest tip error component was in the needle insertion direction.  Conclusions:   Previous work has indicated HDR-BT needles may be manually segmented using SR3D images with insertion depth errors ≤3 mm and ≤5 mm for 83% and 92% of needles, respectively. The algorithm shows promise for reducing the time required for the segmentation of straight HDR-BT needles, and future work involves improving needle tip localization performance through improved image quality and modeling curvilinear trajectories.""","""['William Thomas Hrinivich', 'Douglas A Hoover', 'Kathleen Surry', 'Chandima Edirisinghe', 'Jacques Montreuil', ""David D'Souza"", 'Aaron Fenster', 'Eugene Wong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: A comparison of needle segmentation accuracy with two-dimensional image guidance.', 'Accuracy and variability of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy needle tip localization using live two-dimensional and sagittally reconstructed three-dimensional ultrasound.', 'A semiautomatic segmentation method for interstitial needles in intraoperative 3D transvaginal ultrasound images for high-dose-rate gynecologic brachytherapy of vaginal tumors.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Robotically controlled three-dimensional micro-ultrasound for prostate biopsy guidance.', 'Fully automatic catheter segmentation in MRI with 3D convolutional neural networks: application to MRI-guided gynecologic brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative 360-deg three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound during needle insertions for high-dose-rate transperineal interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy of vaginal tumors.', 'Automatic Needle Segmentation and Localization in MRI With 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks: Application to MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'Accurate model-based segmentation of gynecologic brachytherapy catheter collections in MRI-images.']"""

Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed the expression of TRIM44 in prostate cancer and assessed the role of TRIM44 in the progression of prostate cancer. Our results showed that the expression of TRIM44 was significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, knockdown of TRIM44 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro, as well as attenuated the tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that knockdown of TRIM44 significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated PI3K and Akt in PC-3 cells.

Factors associated with grade reclassification and curative intervention were evaluated in a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   A total of 1,298 men (median age = 66y) with a median follow-up of 5 years (range: 0.01-18.00y) contributed 6,766 person-years of follow-up since 1995.

Its optimal management remains largely undefined given a lack of prospective, randomized data to inform practice. We sought to describe modern practice patterns in the management of cN+PCa and assess the effect of adding radiation therapy (RT) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on survival using the National Cancer Data Base.  Methods:   Patients with cN+PCa and without distant metastases diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 were included. Five-year overall survival for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 and treated with ADT alone or ADT+RT were compared. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to balance baseline characteristics, and Cox multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality.  Results:   Of 3,540 total patients, 32.2% were treated with ADT alone and 51.4% received ADT+RT. Compared with ADT alone, patients treated with ADT+RT were younger and more likely to have private insurance, lower comorbidity scores, higher Gleason scores, and lower PSA values. After PS matching, 318 patients remained in each group. Compared with ADT alone, ADT+RT was associated with a 50% decreased risk of five-year all-cause mortality (HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37-0.67, two-sided P<0.001; crude OS rate: 71.5% vs. 53.2%).  Conclusions:   Using a large national database, we have identified a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with cN+PCa treated with ADT+RT.

This limits surgical planning, which could be modified to account for focal extracapsular extension with image directed guidance for wider excision. In this study, we evaluate the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in extracapsular extension detection and determine which preoperative variables predict extracapsular extension on final pathology when multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predicts organ confined disease.  Materials and methods:   From May 2007 to March 2014, 169 patients underwent pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy, extended sextant 12-core biopsy, and radical prostatectomy at our institution. A subset of 116 men had multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative for extracapsular extension and were included in the final analysis.  Results:   The 116 men with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative for extracapsular extension had a median age of 61 years (IQR: 57-66) and a median prostate specific antigen of 5.51 ng/ml (IQR: 3.91-9.07). The prevalence of extracapsular extension was 23.1% in the overall population. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extracapsular extension were 48.7%, 73.9%, and 35.9% and 82.8%, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, only patient age (P = 0.002) and magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy Gleason score (P = 0.032) were independent predictors of extracapsular extension on final radical prostatectomy pathology.  Conclusions:   Because of the low sensitivity of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extracapsular extension, further tools are necessary to stratify men at risk for occult extracapsular extension that would otherwise only become apparent on final pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy Gleason score can help identify which men with prostate cancer have extracapsular extension that may not be detectable by imaging.""","""['Eggener Scott']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The Role of Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Prostate Biopsy in Stratifying Men for Risk of Extracapsular Extension at Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Prostate Biopsy in Stratifying Men for Risk of Extracapsular Extension at Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Added Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Clinical Nomograms for Predicting Adverse Pathology in Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Can magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates?: A.

We assessed whether concomitant treatment with ADT plus docetaxel would result in longer overall survival than that with ADT alone.  Methods:   We assigned men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to receive either ADT plus docetaxel (at a dose of 75mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3wk for 6 cycles) or ADT alone. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that the median overall survival would be 33.3% longer among patients receiving docetaxel added to ADT early during therapy than among patients receiving ADT alone.  Results:   A total of 790 patients (median age, 63y) underwent randomization. After a median follow-up of 28.9 months, the median overall survival was 13.6 months longer with ADT plus docetaxel (combination therapy) than with ADT alone (57.6 vs. 44.0mo; hazard ratio for death in the combination group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-0.80; P<0.001). The median time to biochemical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression was 20.2 months in the combination group, as compared with 11.7 months in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.51-0.72; P<0.001). The rate of a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.2ng/ml at 12 months was 27.7% in the combination group vs. 16.8% in the ADT-alone group (P<0.001). In the combination group, the rate of grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was 6.2%, the rate of grade 3 or 4 infection with neutropenia was 2.3%, and the rate of grade 3 sensory neuropathy and of grade 3 motor neuropathy was 0.5%.  Conclusions:   Six cycles of docetaxel at the beginning of ADT for metastatic prostate cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival than that with ADT alone.

In addition to the production of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species, PDT can induce the release of nitric oxide (NO) by up-regulating nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Since non-optimal PDT often causes tumor recurrence, understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the photoprocess is a challenging task for scientists. The present study has examined the response of the PC3 human metastatic prostate cancer cell line, following repeated low-dose pheophorbide a treatments, mimicking non-optimal PDT treatment. The analysis was focused on the NF-kB/YY1/RKIP circuitry as it is (i) dysregulated in cancer cells (ii) modulated by NO and (iii) correlated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesized that a repeated treatment of non-optimal PDT induces low levels of NO that lead to cell growth and EMT via regulation of the above circuitry. The expressions of gene products involved in the circuitry and in EMT were analyzed by western blot. The findings demonstrate the cytoprotective role of NO following non-optimal PDT treatments that was corroborated by the use of l-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS.""","""['Valentina Rapozzi', 'Emilia Della Pietra', 'Benjamin Bonavida', 'Luigi Emilio Xodo']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Repeated sub-optimal photodynamic treatments with pheophorbide a induce an epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells via nitric oxide.', 'A photodynamic bifunctional conjugate for prostate cancer: an in vitro mechanistic study.', 'Dual roles of nitric oxide in the regulation of tumor cell response and resistance to photodynamic therapy.', 'Role of NF-κB/Snail/RKIP loop in the response of tumor cells to photodynamic therapy.', 'Dual role of NO donors in the reversal of tumor cell resistance and EMT: Downregulation of the NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP circuitry.']"""

We investigated 145 SNP-polymorphisms and a (CCTTT)n-microsatellite in the NOS2-gene in 3161 prostate-cancer patients and 2149 controls from a Swedish population-based GWAS-study.  Aim:   To analyze possible associations between NOS2-polymorphisms, prostate cancer, and prostate cancer pathogenesis.  Methods:   Two groups were analyzed, those with advanced tumours (Gleason≥6), and those with tumours of mixed Gleason-statues. Affymetrix 5.0-chip (SNP-polymorphisms), DNA Fragment-analysis and Sequencing ((CCTTT)n-microsatellite) were used for genotyping. Genotypes were combined with information on tumour stage, Gleason, PSA, metastases and cancer-specific death, using clinical follow-up.  Results:   We divided the (CCTTT)n-alleles into short (S, n≤10), intermediate (M, n=11-12) and long (L, n≥13). Patients homozygous for longer repeats (LL) had decreased risk of highly aggressive (Gleason ≥7;PSA>20;T3+) tumours (OR:0.40;CI:0.14-1.08;p=0.071), but, once ill they showed a threefold increased risk of dying in prostate cancer (HR:3.31;CI:0.85-12.85;p=0.084), compared to SS-homozygotes. The SNP-alleles that co-varied with the (CCTTT)l-allele also had lower risk of aggressive tumours, as well as, once ill, a 2-4 times higher risk of dying (p=0.009). Also the proportion of patients with lymph node metastases increased with length of the (CCTTT)n-alleles of the patients (SS<SM<SL<MM<ML <LL)(trend analysis; p=0.033).

Furthermore 46 genes, of which 23 were associated with basal like breast cancer, were elevated when iNOS high. In vitro studies using ER(-) cell lines showed that fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) delivered by NO donors surprising mimic this relationship in the patient cohort. Using this model, we show that NO at different specific concentrations stimulate pro-oncogenic mechanisms such as AKT, ERK, NFkB, AP-1, and HIF-1α that lead to increase of metastatic and cancer stem cells proteins. In addition, we show that tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and PP2A are inhibited by these NO levels. Similarly other studies show that these concentrations of NO increase immunosuppressive proteins TGF-β and IL-10 in leukocytes to decrease efficacy of some anticancer therapies further contributing to pro-tumorigenic environment.

Next-generation sequencing of patient tumors has revealed that ATM is altered in many human cancers including colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast. Here, we show that the colorectal cancer cell line SK-CO-1 lacks detectable ATM protein expression and is sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Similarly, HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with shRNA depletion of ATM are sensitive to olaparib, and depletion of p53 enhances this sensitivity. Moreover, HCT116 cells are sensitive to olaparib in combination with the ATM inhibitor KU55933, and sensitivity is enhanced by deletion of p53.

In the present study, a critical comparison is performed between Ad-PGp53 and AdRGD-PGp53, where the RGD motif was incorporated in the adenoviral fiber protein. AdRGD-PGp53 provided superior transgene expression levels and resulted in the killing of prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and PC3. In vitro, this effect was associated with increased production of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oxidants, DNA damage as revealed by detection of phosphorylated H2AX, as well as cell death consistent with apoptosis. Differential gene expression of key mediators of reactive oxygen species pathways was also observed. Specifically, it was noted that induction of known p53-target genes Sestrin2 and PIG3, as well as a novel target, NOX1, occurred in PC3 cells only when transduced with the improved vector, AdRGD-PGp53. The participation of NOX1 was confirmed upon its inhibition using a specific peptide, resulting in reduced cell death. In situ gene therapy also resulted in significantly improved inhibition of tumor progression consistent with oxidant-induced DNA damage only when treated with the novel AdRGD-PGp53 vector.

In this study, we investigated whether AR-42 would prevent or decrease. The growth and metastasis of a canine PCa (Ace-1 cells) to bone in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Proliferation, cell viability, invasion, and metastasis of a canine prostate cancer cell line (Ace-1) were measured following treatment with AR-42. Expression of anoikis resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stem cell-related markers were also evaluated. To assess the efficacy of AR-42 on prevention of PCa metastasis to bone, Ace-1 cells were injected in the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice, mice were treated with AR-42, and the incidence and growth of bone metastasis were measured. Bioluminescence was performed to monitor the bone metastases in nude mice.  Results:   AR-42 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of Ace-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50 concentration of AR-42 for Ace-1 cells was 0.42 μM after 24 hr of treatment. AR-42 induced apoptosis, decreased cell migration, and increased the stem cell properties of Ace-1 cells in vitro. AR-42 downregulated E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TWIST, MYOF, anoikis resistance, and osteomimicry genes, while it upregulated SNAIL, PTEN, FAK, and ZEB1 gene expression in Ace-1 cells. Importantly, AR-42 decreased the bioluminescence and incidence of bone metastasis in nude mice. In addition, AR-42 induced apoptosis and altered the tumor cell morphology to an irregular cell phenotype with condensed chromatin in the bone metastases.  Conclusion:   AR-42 decreased PCa growth and bone metastasis, induced apoptosis, and downregulated osteomimicry genes in PCa cells in the bone microenvironment.

While there is a growing body of research into phytotherapeutic agents in this cohort, with some promising results, as yet no definitive recommendations can be made. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a fully-powered study to examine the effects of this phytotherapeutic intervention (containing turmeric, resveratrol, green tea and broccoli sprouts) on PSA doubling time in men with biochemical recurrence with a moderate PSA rise rate.  Methods:   A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted with 22 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate rise rate (PSA doubling time of 4-15 months and no evidence of metastases from conventional imaging methods). Patients were randomized to either the active treatment arm or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were feasibility of study recruitment and procedures, and measurement of proposed secondary endpoints (prostate symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression as measured on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25, the IPSS and HADS). Data were collected to estimate PSA-log slopes and PSA-doubling times, using a mixed model, for both the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods.  Results:   Adherence to study protocol was excellent, and the phytotherapeutic intervention was well-tolerated, with similar numbers of mild-to-moderate adverse events in the active and placebo arms. Both the intervention and data collection methods were acceptable to participants. No statistical difference between groups on clinical outcomes was expected in this pilot study. There was between-subject variation in the PSA post treatment, but on average the active treatment group experienced a non-significant increase in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.2 months, post-treatment doubling time = 5.5 months), and the placebo group experienced no change in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.8 months, post-treatment doubling time = 10.9 months).  Conclusion:   The findings suggest that a fully powered study of this combination is feasible in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate PSA rise rate.

Here, comparing single-cell RNA-Seq profiles of CTCs from breast, prostate and lung cancers, we observe consistent induction of β-globin (HBB), but not its partner α-globin (HBA). The tumour-specific origin of HBB is confirmed by sequence polymorphisms within human xenograft-derived CTCs in mouse models. Increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured breast CTCs triggers HBB induction, mediated through the transcriptional regulator KLF4. Depletion of HBB in CTC-derived cultures has minimal effects on primary tumour growth, but it greatly increases apoptosis following ROS exposure, and dramatically reduces CTC-derived lung metastases. These effects are reversed by the anti-oxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine. Conversely, overexpression of HBB is sufficient to suppress intracellular ROS within CTCs.

Patients and methods:   The stretched PL (SPL) of 102 patients was measured before, 10 days after, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after RP. The perpendicular distance from the distal end of the membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet was measured on mid-sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice at three time points: preoperatively; 10 days after RP; and 12 months after RP. Pre- and postoperative SPLs were compared using paired Student's t-test. Predictors of PL shortening at 10 days and at 12 months after RP were evaluated on univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   The SPL was shortest 10 days after RP (mean PL shortening from preoperative level: 19.9 mm), and gradually recovered thereafter. SPL at 12 months after RP was not significantly different from preoperative SPL. On MRI examination, the distal end of membranous urethra was found to have moved proximally (mean proximal displacement: 3.9 mm) at 10 days after RP, and to have returned to the preoperative position at 12 months after RP. On univariate analysis, only the volume of the removed prostate was a predictor of SPL change at 10 days after surgery; on multivariate analysis, the association was not statistically significant. No predictor of SPL change was found at 12 months after RP.  Conclusion:   The SPL was shortest at 10 days after RP and gradually recovered thereafter in the present study. Anatomically, the glans and corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra are an integral structure, and the proximal urethra is drawn into the pelvis during urethrovesical anastomosis. This is the first report showing that slight vertical repositioning of the membranous urethra after RP causes changes in SPL over time.

Its resistance was observed when it was in the clinical research stage. AR mutation is the main factor of enzalutamide resistance. AR F876L and F876L_T877A mutations were reported to switch enzalutamide from AR antagonist to agonist, but W741C cannot. There are various mutations in the ligand binding domain of AR LBD, such as L701H, W741L, H874Y, T877A, and M895T, if these mutations can lead to drug resistance problem or not is not known. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics Generalized Born (GB) surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were employed to explore the interaction mechanisms between enzalutamide and wild-type (WT)/mutant ARs. The simulation results indicate that helix 12 (H12), which lies on the top of the AR LBD like a cover, plays a vital role for the function of enzalutamide. When C-ring of enzalutamide locates near to H12, the distance between enzalutamide and H12 is reduced, which prevents H12 from closing and distort the coactivator binding site, resulting in the inactivation of transcription. In this case, enzalutamide acts as an AR antagonist. However, when the C-ring of enzalutamide is near to helix H11 or the Loop 11-12, H12 tends to close to form a coactivator binding site to facilitate transcription, enzalutamide acts as an AR agonist. Moreover, per-residue free energy decomposition analysis indicates that M895 and I899 are key residues in the antagonist mechanism of enzalutamide. J. Cell.

Little large-scale evidence exists on factors related to receipt of non-cancer-related TURP.  Methods:   A prospective study of men aged ≥45 years participating in the 45 and Up Study, a large Australian cohort study, without prior prostatectomy and/or bowel/genital/urinary-tract cancer; questionnaire data were linked to hospitalisations and deaths. HRs for TURP were estimated in relation to multiple factors, adjusting for confounders.  Results:   There were 3416 incident TURPs among 106 769 men (median follow-up 5.8 years), with rates of 1.8, 5.3, 9.1 and 11.4/1000 person-years for ages 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and ≥75 years, respectively. Age-adjusted rates of TURP varied markedly according to baseline LUTS from 2.2/1000 person-years with no/mild symptoms to 30.7/1000 person-years with severe symptoms. Annual household income ≥$70 000 versus <$20 000, having private health insurance and living in major cities were associated with higher TURP rates; there were no significant differences according to baseline diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. Men reporting severe versus no physical functioning limitation, high versus low psychological distress or poor versus excellent self-rated health were 36-51% more likely to undergo procedures overall, but were 24-37% less likely to undergo procedures following additional adjustment for need (baseline LUTS).  Conclusions:   TURP rates were most strongly related to baseline LUTS and age, consistent with appropriate health services targeting. Lower TURP rates in men experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage and with poor health/disability, after accounting for baseline LUTS, suggest inequity and factors such as frailty and risks related to surgery.""","""['Grace Joshy', 'Kay Soga', 'Rosemary J Korda', 'Manish I Patel', 'Emily Banks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Increased population use of medications for male lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia correlates with changes in indications for transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'EAU guidelines on the treatment and follow-up of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction.', 'Prospective, randomized, multinational study of prostatic urethral lift versus transurethral resection of the prostate: 12-month results from the BPH6 study.', 'Modified transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for men with moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) before brachytherapy is safe and feasible.', ""Examining the 'gold standard': a comparative critical analysis of three consecutive decades of monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) outcomes.""]"""

However, once PCa is no longer organ-confined, it is associated with significant mortality. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one mechanism facilitating progression in cancer. Our studies of transglutaminase-4 (TGase-4), a member of the TGase family, expressed in the prostate gland, have implicated it in the regulation of the invasive properties of PCa. The present study investigated the role of TGase-4 on EMT of PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   A panel of PCa cell lines: CA-HPV-10, PZ-HPV-7, PC-3 and DU-145 were used. An anti-TGase-4 transgene was constructed to eliminate the expression of TGase-4 in CA-HPV-10 (positive for TGase-4). An expression construct for human TGase-4 was used to transfect PCa cells negative for TGase-4. The pattern of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin in these cells were evaluated using immunofluorescent staining. Cell motility was assessed using scratch wounding and ekectric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assays.  Results:   Treatment of PZ-HPV-7 and CA-HPV-10 cells with rhTGase-4 resulted in a significant increase in cell migration (1,407.9 Ω±6.4 Ω vs. 1,691.2 Ω±8.3 Ω in non-treated and rhTGase-4 treated cells, respectively, p<0.01). Cells strongly expressing E-cadherin showed substantial changes of E-cadherin staining in that, after treatment with TGase-4, the intercellular staining of E-cadherin was diminished. Concomitantly, there was acquisition of N-cadherin in TGase-4-treated cells. Elimination of TGase-4 from CA-HPV-10 cells significantly decreased cell motility (128.1 Ω±107.4 Ω vs. 31.7 Ω±26.2 Ω, in CA-HPV-10 control and CA-HPV-10/TGase-4 knockout cells). Knocking- out TGase-4 from CA-HPV-10 cells also resulted in substantial loss of N-cadherin in the cells.  Conclusion:   TGase-4 resulted in loss of E-cadherin/acquisition of N-cadherin and cell migration indicating it is a keen regulator of EMT in prostate epithelia-derived cancer cells.

Medicinal plants are currently being evaluated as source of promising anticancer agents. In this paper, we have investigated the anticancer potential of plant Allium wallichii, a plant native to Nepal and growing at elevations of 2300-4800 m. This is the first study of its kind for the plant mentioned.  Methods:   The dried plant was extracted in aqueous ethanol. Phytochemical screening, anti-microbial assay, anti-oxidant assay, cytotoxicity assay and the flow-cytometric analysis were done for analyzing different phytochemicals present, anti-microbial activity, anti-oxidant activity and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii.  Results:   We observed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, reducing sugars and glycosides in the plant extract and the plant showed moderate anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity. The IC50 values of Allium wallichii in different cancer cell lines are 69.69 μg/ml for Prostate cancer (PC3) cell line, 55.29 μg/ml for Breast Cancer (MCF-7) cell line and 46.51 μg/ml for cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line as compared to Doxorubicin (0.85 μg/ml).

The effects of medical mistrust among men with prostate cancer are unknown. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine the association between medical mistrust and quality of life (QOL) among black and white men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 877 men (415 black, 462 white) with prostate cancer between the ages of 40 to 81 years who entered the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry during the years 2007 and 2008 were retrospectively recruited. The dependent variable was overall QOL measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaire. The primary independent variable was medical mistrust. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the association between medical mistrust and overall QOL.  Results:   Compared with white men, black men reported a higher level of medical mistrust (black = 2.7, white = 2.4; P < .001) and lower QOL (black = 134.4, white = 139.5; P < 0.001). After controlling for demographical and clinical variables, higher levels of medical mistrust were associated with a reduction in overall QOL among men with prostate cancer (beta = -7.73; standard error = 1.54) CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of medical mistrust are associated with reduced overall QOL among black and white men with prostate cancer. Interventions targeted to reduce medical mistrust may be effective in increasing the overall QOL of men with prostate cancer.""","""['Ballington L Kinlock', 'Lauren J Parker', 'Janice V Bowie', 'Daniel L Howard', 'Thomas A LaVeist', 'Roland J Thorpe Jr']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Control""","""['Racial differences in medical mistrust among men diagnosed with prostate cancer.', 'Fatalism, medical mistrust, and pretreatment health-related quality of life in ethnically diverse prostate cancer patients.', 'Religious Coping and Quality of Life Among Black and White Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Health disparity in use of novel agents for first-line therapy in Black and White patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the Department of Veterans Affairs.', 'Development and Psychometric Evaluation of Healthcare Access Measures among Women with Ovarian Cancer.', 'Provider Mistrust and Telemedicine Abortion Care Preferences Among Patients in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky.', 'Navigation programs relevant for African American men with prostate cancer: a scoping review protocol.', 'Racial-ethnic differences in health-related quality of life among adults and children with glomerular disease.']"""

Lasalocid-induced apoptosis was involved with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In addition, lasalocid induced autophagy through microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3)-II conversion, acidic vesicular organelles formation and GFP-LC-3 punctuate, which was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a widely used pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, the autophagic phenomena were mediated by production of ROS, confirming that inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated lasalocid-triggered autophagy.

Few effective therapies are available for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa), and progressive metastatic lesions such as lymph nodes and bones cause mortality. We recently identified AES as a metastasis suppressor for colon cancer. Here, we have studied the roles of AES in PCa progression. We analyzed the relationship between AES expression and PCa stages of progression by immunohistochemistry of human needle biopsy samples. We then performed overexpression and knockdown of AES in human PCa cell lines LNCaP, DU145 and PC3, and determined the effects on proliferation, invasion and metastasis in culture and in a xenograft model. We also compared the PCa phenotypes of Aes/Pten compound knockout mice with those of Pten simple knockout mice. Expression levels of AES were inversely correlated with clinical stages of human PCa. Exogenous expression of AES suppressed the growth of LNCaP cells, whereas the AES knockdown promoted it. We also found that AES suppressed transcriptional activities of androgen receptor and Notch signaling. Notably, AES overexpression in AR-defective DU145 and PC3 cells reduced invasion and metastasis to lymph nodes and bones without affecting proliferation in culture. Consistently, prostate epithelium-specific inactivation of Aes in Ptenflox/flox mice increased expression of Snail and MMP9, and accelerated growth, invasion and lymph node metastasis of the mouse prostate tumor. These results suggest that AES plays an important role in controlling tumor growth and metastasis of PCa by regulating both AR and Notch signaling pathways.""","""['Yoshiyuki Okada', 'Masahiro Sonoshita', 'Fumihiko Kakizaki', 'Naoki Aoyama', 'Yoshiro Itatani', 'Masayuki Uegaki', 'Hiromasa Sakamoto', 'Takashi Kobayashi', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Tomomi Kamba', 'Akira Suzuki', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'M Mark Taketo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'AR function in promoting metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Bioinformatics Prediction and Machine Learning on Gene Expression Data Identifies Novel Gene Candidates in Gastric Cancer.', 'Roles of transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family proteins in tumorigenesis and immune regulation.', 'Bmal1 Regulates Prostate Growth via Cell-Cycle Modulation.', 'Drosophila as a toolkit to tackle cancer and its metabolism.', 'The role of the WNT signaling pathway in the maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Design, setting and participants:   Analysis of population-based cancer registry data for prostate cancer cases (aged 18-84 years) diagnosed in 1996-2007, and a linked dataset with hospital admission data for men with prostate cancer diagnosed during 2005-2007 in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.  Methods:   Cancer registry data (1996-2007) were used to project complete prostate cancer prevalence in NSW, Australia for 2008-2017, and treatment information from hospital records (2005-2007) was used to estimate the inpatient care needs during the first year after diagnosis. The projected complete prevalence was divided into care needs-based groups. We first divided the cohort into two groups based on patient's age (<75 and 75-84 years). The younger cohort was further divided into initial care and monitoring phases. Cause of death data were used as a proxy for patients requiring last year of life prostate cancer care. Finally, episode data were used to estimate the future number of cases with metastatic progression.  Results:   Of the estimated total of 60,910 men with a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2017, the largest groups will be older patients (52.0%) and younger men who require monitoring (42.5%). If current treatment patterns continue, in the first year post-diagnosis 41% (1380) of patients (<75 years) will have a radical prostatectomy, and 52.6% (1752) will be likely to have either active surveillance, external beam radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy. About 3% will require care for subsequent metastases, and 1288 men with prostate cancer are likely to die from the disease in 2017.  Conclusions:   This method extends the application of routinely collected population-based data, and can contribute much to the knowledge of the number of men with prostate cancer and their health care requirements.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play pivotal roles in the cell survival of many human tumors. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of altholactone against prostate cancer DU145 cells and to evaluate whether its effects are mediated by inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 activity. Altholactone inhibited proliferation of DU145 cells and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase and triggered apoptosis. Reporter assays revealed that altholactone repressed p65- and TNF-α-enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity and also inhibited both constitutive and IL-6-induced transcriptional activity of STAT3. Consistent with this, altholactone down-regulated phosphorylation of STAT3 and moreover, decreased constitutively active mutant of STAT3 (STAT3C)-induced transcriptional activity. Altholactone treatment also results in down-regulation of STAT3 target genes such as survivin, and Bcl-2 followed by up regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax protein. However, pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited the activation of Bax and prevented down-regulation of STAT3 target genes.

Aberrant control of Cxs and gap junction intercellular communication may contribute to many diseases, including the promotion of cancer. Cd exposure is associated with increased risk of human prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The roles of Cxs in the effects of Cd on the prostate have, however, not been reported previously. In this study, the human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 was exposed to Cd. A low dose of Cd stimulated cell proliferation along with a lower degree of gap junction intercellular communication and an elevated level of the protein Cx43. Cd exposure increased the levels of intracellular Ca2+ and phosphorylated Cx43 at the Ser368 site. Knockdown of Cx43 using siRNA blocked Cd-induced proliferation and interfered with the Cd-induced changes in the protein levels of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, p27Kip1 (p27) and p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21). The increase in Cx43 expression induced by Cd was presumably mediated by the androgen receptor, because it was abolished upon treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. Thus, a low dose of Cd promotes cell proliferation in RWPE-1, possibly mediated by Cx43 expression through an effect on cell cycle-associated proteins. Cx43 might be a target for prostatic diseases associated with Cd exposure.

Therefore, a novel AR antagonist, enzalutamide, is used clinically for the treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. However, enzalutamide-resistant AR has appeared, and a new type of AR antagonist is desired. Previously, in the course of screening for a new type of AR antagonist, we isolated a series of compounds, designated antarlides A-E, that share a novel 22-membered-ring macrocyclic structure and are produced by Streptomyces sp. BB47. In the present study, we found that this strain also produces antarlides F-H as minor components. Antarlide F is a novel geometric isomer of known antarlides. On the other hand, antarlides G and H are new members of the antarlide family that have a 20-membered-ring macrocyclic structure. Antarlides G and H inhibited the binding of androgen to AR in vitro at concentrations similar to those observed with antarlides A-E. In addition, antarlide G inhibited the transcriptional activity of not only wild-type AR but also enzalutamide-resistant AR, suggesting that antarlides with either 22- or 20-membered rings may serve as potent third-generation AR antagonists capable of overcoming resistance to enzalutamide.""","""['Shun Saito', 'Takahiro Fujimaki', 'Watanalai Panbangred', 'Ryuichi Sawa', 'Yasuhiro Igarashi', 'Masaya Imoto']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Antibiot (Tokyo)""","""['Androgen receptor antagonists produced by Streptomyces overcome resistance to enzalutamide.', 'Antarlides: A New Type of Androgen Receptor (AR) Antagonist that Overcomes Resistance to AR-Targeted Therapy.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'ODM-201: a new-generation androgen receptor inhibitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).']"""

Our objective was to explain (part of) these prostate cancer deaths by undergrading with the classical Gleason score.  Methods:   Biopsy specimens of 98 men with classical Gleason score ≤6 or 3 + 4 = 7 at prevalence screening in the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Rotterdam were retrospectively reviewed by two pathologists using the International Society of Urological Pathology 2014 modified Gleason score. These 98 men included 15 men with cT1/2 classical Gleason score ≤6 who died of prostate cancer (cases) and 83 randomly selected men with classical Gleason score ≤6 or 3 + 4 = 7 (controls). The primary outcome was the reclassification rate from classical Gleason score ≤6 to modified classical Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (grade group 2) stratified for prostate cancer death. The secondary outcome was the rate of cribriform/intraductal carcinoma in Gleason score-reclassified men stratified for prostate cancer death.  Results:   A total of 79 out of 98 men had classical Gleason score ≤6 prostate cancer. A total of eight out of 15 (53%) prostate cancer deaths with classical Gleason score ≤6 were reclassified to modified Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, compared with 16 out of 64 (25%) men with non-fatal prostate cancer (P = 0.017). A total of five out of eight (63%) Gleason score-reclassified men with fatal prostate cancer had cribriform/intraductal carcinoma, compared with two out of 16 (13%) Gleason score-reclassified men with non-fatal prostate cancer (P = 0.011).  Conclusions:   Part of the prostate cancer deaths with Gleason score ≤6 at prevalence screening in the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Rotterdam could be explained by biopsy undergrading.

The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) can serve as an insightful indicator of cancer management outcomes for individual nations. By calculating MIRs for the top five cancers in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the current study attempted to characterize the outcomes of national cancer management policies according to the health system ranking of each country.  Methods:   The MIRs for the five most burdensome cancers globally (lung, colorectal, prostate, stomach, and breast) were calculated for all 34 OECD countries using 2012 GLOBOCAN incidence and mortality statistics. Health system rankings reported by the World Health Organization in 2000 were updated with relevant information when possible. A linear regression model was created, using MIRs as the dependent variable and health system rankings as the independent variable.  Results:   The linear relationships between MIRs and health system rankings for the five cancers were significant, with coefficients of determination ranging from 49 to 75% when outliers were excluded. A clear outlier, Korea reported lower-than-predicted MIRs for stomach and colorectal cancer, reflecting its strong national cancer control policies, especially cancer screening.  Conclusions:   The MIR was found to be a practical measure for evaluating the long-term success of cancer surveillance and the efficacy of cancer control programs, especially cancer screening. Extending the use of MIRs to evaluate other cancers may also prove useful.""","""['Eunji Choi', 'Sangeun Lee', 'Bui Cam Nhung', 'Mina Suh', 'Boyoung Park', 'Jae Kwan Jun', 'Kui Son Choi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Epidemiol Health""","""['The colorectal cancer mortality-to-incidence ratio as an indicator of global cancer screening and care.', 'The Colorectal Cancer Mortality-to-Incidence Ratio as a Potential Cancer Surveillance Measure in Asia.', 'The gender difference and mortality-to-incidence ratio relate to health care disparities in bladder cancer: National estimates from 33 countries.', 'A diversity of cancer incidence and mortality in West Asian populations.', 'Cancer control in the Asia Pacific region: current status and concerns.', 'Clinical Guidance on the Monitoring and Management of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd)-Related Adverse Events: Insights from an Asia-Pacific Multidisciplinary Panel.', 'Improved Trends in the Mortality-to-Incidence Ratios for Liver Cancer in Countries with High Development Index and Health Expenditures.', 'Updated epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia.', 'Trend in Gastric Cancer Mortality in Kazakhstan.', 'A scoping review on population-centered indicators for cancer care continuum.']"""

The goal of this post hoc analysis was to associate levels of PSA decline from baseline after enzalutamide with clinical outcomes in the postchemotherapy mCRPC setting.  Methods:   Men in the AFFIRM trial (n = 1199) were grouped by maximal PSA decline in the first 90 days of treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates evaluated the association of defined PSA changes from baseline with OS, progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS), and pain response. Each PSA decline category was assessed for OS surrogacy using Prentice criteria, proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE), and proportion of variation explained.  Results:   Men treated with enzalutamide had improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; P < .001) and higher rates of PSA decline (odds ratio, >19.0; P < .001) versus placebo. PSA declines of any, ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥90% with enzalutamide were strongly associated with greater OS, PSA PFS, rPFS (P < .001), and pain response (P < .026) versus PSA increase/no decline. Any, ≥30%, and ≥50% declines in PSA resulted in the PTE range of 1.07-1.29, where treatment was no longer significant after adjustment for decline measures (P > .20).  Conclusions:   PSA declines of any, ≥30%, and ≥50% following enzalutamide were associated with greater clinical and pain response and improvements in PFS and OS. Surrogacy of PSA decline for OS was not fully established, possibly due to lack of PSA declines with placebo, and discordant results between PSA and imaging responses over time, and because some declines were not durable due to rapid resistance development. However, a lack of PSA decline by 90 days following enzalutamide treatment was a poor prognosis indicator in this setting. Conclusions from sensitivity analyses of maximal PSA decline from baseline over the entire treatment period are consistent with PSA declines restricted to the first 90 days.

Methods:   The medical records of 155 consecutive patients who underwent AMS 800™ implantation from 2003 to 2015 were reviewed. Treatment success (TS) was defined as no need for pads, and social continence (SC) was defined as a need for pad ≤1/day at last follow-up. The efficacy, complication rates, and associated risk factors with reoperation and durability of primary AUS implantation, as well as treatment outcomes following AUS revision were evaluated.  Results:   The median age was 69.0 years (range 27-85), and median follow-up was 45.1 months (range 9-126). The rates of TS and SC were 63.2% and 84.5%, respectively. The reoperation rate of AUS was 26.4%. Non-mechanical failure (70.7%) was a dominant etiology of reoperation. The 5-year device survival rate without reoperation was 67.0%.

TSPY and TSPX competitively bind to the androgen receptor (AR) and AR variants, such as AR-V7, at their conserved SET/NAP domain, and exacerbate and repress the transactivation of the AR/AR-V7 target genes in ligand dependent and independent manners respectively. The inhibitory domain has been mapped to the carboxyl acidic domain of TSPX, truncation of which renders TSPX to be stimulatory while its transposition to the C-terminus of TSPY results in an inhibitory hybrid protein. TSPY and TSPX co-localize with the endogenous AR, in the presence of ligand, on the promoters and differentially regulate the expression of the endogenous AR target genes in the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Transcriptome analysis shows that TSPY and TSPX expressions differentially affect significant numbers of canonical pathways, upstream regulators and cellular functions. Significantly, among the common ones, TSPY activates and TSPX inhibits numerous growth-related and oncogenic canonical pathways and cellular functions in the respective cell populations. Hence, TSPY and TSPX exert opposing effects on the transactivation functions of AR and AR-Vs important for various physiological and disease processes sensitive to male sex hormone actions, thereby not only affecting the pathogenesis of male-specific prostate cancer but also likely contributing to sex differences in the health and diseases of man.""","""['Yunmin Li', 'Dong Ji Zhang', 'Yun Qiu', 'Tatsuo Kido', 'Yun-Fai Chris Lau']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Battle of the sexes: contrasting roles of testis-specific protein Y-encoded (TSPY) and TSPX in human oncogenesis.', 'TSPY, the candidate gonadoblastoma gene on the human Y chromosome, has a widely expressed homologue on the X - implications for Y chromosome evolution.', 'Expression of the human TSPY gene in the brains of transgenic mice suggests a potential role of this Y chromosome gene in neural functions.', 'The potential contributions of a Y-located protooncogene and its X homologue in sexual dimorphisms in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Gonadoblastoma locus and the TSPY gene on the human Y chromosome.', 'Repetitive DNA Sequences in the Human Y Chromosome and Male Infertility.', 'Analysis of novel enzalutamide-resistant cells: upregulation of testis-specific Y-encoded protein gene promotes the expression of androgen receptor splicing variant 7.', 'Y chromosome is moving out of sex determination shadow.', 'Update on genetic screening and treatment for infertile men with genetic disorders in the era of assisted reproductive technology.', 'Epigenetic modification-dependent androgen receptor occupancy facilitates the ectopic TSPY1 expression in prostate cancer cells.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of EA treatment on interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression, cell viability, IL-6 secretion, phosphorylated STAT3, ERK, and AKT cellular signaling proteins in human prostate cancer cells (PC3).  Materials and methods:   The cytotoxic effects of the EA (0-100 µM) on PC3 cells were determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. IL-6 gene expression was down, using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cellular concentration of phosphorylated ERK1/2, AKT, and STAT3 signaling pathways was assessed by Western blotting technic.  Results:   EA treatment of PC3 cells resulted in a reduction of cell viability and phosphorylated STAT3, ERK, and AKT signaling proteins after 72 h in a dose-dependent manner. IL-6 gene expression and IL-6 levels significantly increased (P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent pattern in treated PC3 with EA. Thus, these data suggested the essential role of signaling proteins in EA-mediated anti-proliferation of PC3 cells.

The aim was to analyze the relationships between DPP-4i therapy with risk of metastases in type 2 diabetes patients with breast, prostate and digestive organ cancers.  Methods:   Type 2 diabetes patients with first diagnoses of breast, prostate or digestive organ cancer were selected in general and internal medicine practices (Disease Analyzer Germany: 01/2008-12/2014). Propensity score matching between DPP-4i users and non-users was carried out for age, sex, diabetes duration, and metformin use. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for metastases further adjusting for HbA1c, body mass index, comorbidity and co-therapy with glucose-lowering drugs (3-4years follow-up).

Patients with pathologically insignificant prostate cancer were defined as having organ-confined disease with tumor volume less than 0.5 cm³ without Gleason scores of 4 or 5. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a stepwise selection was used to model the relationship between preoperative characteristics and insignificant prostate cancer, and a nomogram to predict the probability of insignificant prostate cancer was created.

In our previous study of prostate cancer, the REIC/Dkk-3-expressing adenoviral vector (Ad-REIC) was found to induce cancer-selective apoptosis. This study recently developed a novel super gene expression (SGE) system and used this system to re-construct an Ad-REIC vector, termed the Ad-SGE-REIC, to achieve more effective therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the therapeutic effects of Ad-SGE-REIC on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was assessed.  Methods:   Human HCC cell lines (HLE, Huh7, HepG2, HLF, SK-Hep1, and PLC), human HCC tissues, and mouse HCC cell line (Hepa1-6) were used in this study. REIC/Dkk-3 expression was assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The relative cell viability and the apoptotic effect were examined in vitro, and the anti-tumor effects of Ad-SGE-REIC treatment were analyzed in the mouse xenograft model. This study additionally assessed anti-tumor immunological effects on the immunocompetent mice.  Results:   REIC/Dkk-3 expression was decreased in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. Ad-SGE-REIC reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines (HLE and Huh7), inhibited tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model, and demonstrated in vivo anti-cancer immunostimulatory effects on the HCC cell line (Hepa1-6).  Conclusions:   Ad-SGE-REIC treatment not only enhanced cell killing effects in vitro but also elicited significant therapeutic effects, with tumor growth suppression, in vivo.

Herein, the HS-5-derived factor (HS-5 DF) was characterized and identified.  Methods:   Conditioned media from confluent HS-5 cells were collected and modified for biochemical characteristic testing of HS-5 DF. Cell survival was measured by apoptosis assay and live/dead assay. Fibulin-1 was identified from gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The validation of Fibulin-1 as a HS-5 DF was done by immunoprecipitation (IP) and genetic knockdown by CRISPR/Cas9 system.  Results:   HS-5 DF was trypsin and heat sensitive, but pH stable. The tentative size of the factor fell between 30 kDa and 100 kDa. TGF-β1 treatment led to a suppression of HS-5 DF activity, a property consistent with bone metastasis in prostate cancer. Examination of TGF-β1 down regulated proteins led to identification of fibulin-1 as a candidate for the DF. IP of Fibulin-1 from HS-5 CM and CRISPR knockdown of Fibulin-1 showed a significant reduction of HS-5 CM-derived PCa cell death. These results strongly support a role for fibulin-1 in HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell induction of PCa cell death.

The primary aim of this study was to inform providers on patient-expressed issues while enhancing the content validity of instruments assessing QL and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in prostate cancer. The study provided additional psychometric properties for the new PRO and QL instrument, the Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS).  Methods:   An anonymous web-based survey of 2128 patients with prostate cancer was conducted with patients rating 18 QL items on a five-point scale.  Results:   Most respondents (74%) were aged 55-74 years, had early stage disease at diagnosis (81%) and were diagnosed within 2 years of the survey (81%). The top five-rated issues were: overall QL, ability to perform normal activities, maintaining independence, ability to sleep and not being a burden. These items were ranked as either 'very important' or 'important' by at least 88% of patients. None of the most highly ranked issues were symptoms. Instead, the highest ranked items were global issues reflecting the impact of symptoms on patients. In addition to the enhanced content validity findings, good reliability results and initial support for construct validity are reported for the PCSS.

This nonspecificity necessitates identification of novel cellular pathways that are reprogrammed selectively in cancer cells and can be exploited to develop pharmacologically superior and less toxic therapeutics. Despite growing awareness on dysregulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells, targeting lipid biosynthesis is still largely uncharted territory. Herein, we report development of a novel nontoxic orally deliverable anticancer formulation of monoethanolamine (Etn) for prostate cancer by targeting the Kennedy pathway of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid biosynthesis.Experimental Design: We first evaluated gastrointestinal tract stability, drug-drug interaction liability, pharmacokinetic, and toxicokinetic properties of Etn to evaluate its suitability as a nontoxic orally deliverable agent. We next performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate efficacy and mechanism of action.Results: Our data demonstrate that Etn exhibits excellent bioavailability, gastrointestinal tract stability, and no drug-drug interaction liability. Remarkably, orally fed Etn inhibited tumor growth in four weeks by approximately 67% in mice bearing human prostate cancer PC-3 xenografts without any apparent toxicity. Mechanistically, Etn exploits selective overexpression of choline kinase in cancer cells, resulting in accumulation of phosphoethanolamine (PhosE), accompanied by downregulation of HIF-1α that induces metabolic stress culminating into cell death.Conclusions: Our study provides first evidence for the superior anticancer activity of Etn, a simple lipid precursor formulation, whose nontoxicity conforms to FDA-approved standards, compelling its clinical development for prostate cancer management.

ELL2 and ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) form a stable complex, and their orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans appear to be functionally similar. In C. elegans, the EAF2 ortholog eaf-1 was reported to interact with the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway to control development and fertility in worms. Because RB loss is frequent in prostate cancer, ELL2 interaction with RB might be important for prostate homeostasis. The present study explored physical and functional interaction of ELL2 with RB in prostate cancer. ELL2 expression in human prostate cancer specimens was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupled with laser capture microdissection. Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with deletion mutagenesis was used to determine ELL2 association with RB. Functional interaction between ELL2 and RB was tested using siRNA knockdown, BrdU incorporation, Transwell, and/or invasion assays in LNCaP, C4-2, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. ELL2 expression was downregulated in high-Gleason score prostate cancer specimens. ELL2 could be bound and stabilized by RB, and this interaction was mediated through the N-terminus of ELL2 and the C-terminus of RB.

After validation of methylation and expression analyses in a larger series of prostate tissues, the functional role of the cluster miR-130b~301b was explored using in vitro studies testing cell viability, apoptosis, invasion and DNA damage in prostate cancer cell lines. Western blot and RT-qPCR were performed to support those observations.  Results:   We found that the miR-130b~301b cluster directs epigenetic activation of cell cycle inhibitors required for DDR activation, thus stimulating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-130b~301b cluster markedly reduced the malignant phenotype of PCa cells.

Results:   Pre- and peri-interventional parameters in transrectal vs. fusion biopsy groups for age (65.2 ± 7.8 vs. 65.5 ± 7.3 years; p = 0.84), prostate specific antigen (10.7 ± 8.5 vs. 10.9 ± 8.7 ng/mL; p = 0.93), preoperative prostate volume (72.5 ± 26.1 vs. 71.8 ± 28.1 mL; p = 0.91) and resected weight (43.7 ± 21.9 vs. 41.4 ± 20.7 g; p = 0.61) showed no significant differences. Analysing the TURP specimen, 5 incidental T1a prostate cancers were found (3 Gleason 3 + 3 = 6; 2 Gleason 3 + 4 = 7, all in the transrectal biopsy group). Although, more biopsy cores were obtained in the MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy group (26 cores [interquartile range, IQR 24-28] vs. 14 cores [IQR 12-24], p < 0.01), there was no statistical impact of the obtained number of cores (p = 0.9) on diagnostic accuracy. Statistical analyses revealed significantly better diagnostic accuracy favoring image-guided fusion biopsy (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Our findings showed that a combination of MRI-targeted and systematic transperineal prostate biopsy improves patient safety. This is associated with a combination of transperineal biopsy technique and pre-interventional MRI.""","""['Svenja Christina Dieffenbacher', 'Ionel Valentin Popeneciu', 'Jan Philipp Radtke', 'Dogu Teber', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Boris Alexander Hadaschik', 'Gencay Hatiboglu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['""In-bore"" MRI prostate biopsy is a safe preoperative clinical tool to exclude significant prostate cancer in symptomatic patients with benign prostatic obstruction before transurethral laser enucleation.', 'Magnetic Resonance and Ultrasound Image Fusion Supported Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Using the Ginsburg Protocol: Technique, Learning Points, and Biopsy Results.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.']"""

Objective:   To investigate the association between regular aspirin and (1) the risk of lethal PC in a large prospective cohort and (2) survival after PC diagnosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   In 1981/82, the Physicians' Health Study randomized 22 071 healthy male physicians to aspirin, β-carotene, both, or placebo. After the trial ended in 1988, annual questionnaires have obtained data on aspirin use, cancer diagnoses, and outcomes up to 2009 for the whole cohort, and to 2015 for PC patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated the relationship between regular aspirin (>3 tablets/week) and lethal PC (metastases or PC death). Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of lethal PC in the whole cohort and postdiagnosis survival among men initially diagnosed with nonlethal PC.  Results and limitations:   Risk analysis revealed that 502 men developed lethal PC by 2009. Current and past regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (current: HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89; past: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) compared to never users. In the survival analysis, 407/3277 men diagnosed with nonlethal PC developed lethal disease by 2015. Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with lower risks of lethal PC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.9). We could not assess aspirin dose, and inconsistencies were observed in some sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   Current regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC among all participants. Current postdiagnostic use was associated with improved survival after diagnosis, consistent with a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on PC progression. A randomized trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.  Patient summary:   We examined the potential effect of regular aspirin use on lethal prostate cancer. We found that taking aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, and taking it after diagnosis may help to prevent prostate cancer from becoming fatal.""","""['Mary K Downer', 'Christopher B Allard', 'Mark A Preston', 'J Michael Gaziano', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Julie L Batista']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Aspirin Use and Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Long-term aspirin use and the risk of total, high-grade, regionally advanced and lethal prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of health professionals, 1988-2006.', 'Use of Low-Dose Aspirin and Mortality After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Preventing Lethal Prostate Cancer with Diet, Supplements, and Rx: Heart Healthy Continues to Be Prostate Healthy and ""First Do No Harm"" Part I.', 'Preventing Lethal Prostate Cancer with Diet, Supplements, and Rx: Heart Healthy Continues to Be Prostate Healthy and ""First Do No Harm"" Part III.', 'Regular use of aspirin is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk in prostate cancer patients receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy.', 'Aspirin and cancer: biological mechanisms and clinical outcomes.', 'Aspirin and cancer survival: a systematic review and meta-analyses of 118 observational studies of aspirin and 18 cancers.', 'Urinary PGE-M in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'The modulation of PD-L1 induced by the oncogenic HBXIP for breast cancer growth.']"""

It is also a major leading cause of cancer death among men of all races. In order to treat prostate cancer, drug combinations are often applied. Drug combinations target at different pathways of cells can potentially lead to higher efficacy and lower toxicity due to drug synergy. In this paper, we sequentially applied a two-level design and a follow-up orthogonal array composite design (OACD) to investigate combinations of five anti-cancer drugs, namely, doxorubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cis-dichlorodiamine platinum and dihydroartemisinin. Our initial screening using a two-level full factorial design identified doxorubicin and docetaxel as the most significant drugs. A follow-up experiment with an OACD revealed more complicated drug interactions among these 5 anti-cancer drugs. Quadratic effects of doxorubicin and paclitaxel appeared to be significant. A further investigation on contour plots of all the two-drug pairs indicated that combination of doxorubicin and docetaxel are the most effective companion, while the combination of cis-dichlorodiamine platinum and dihydroartemisinin showed unknown antagonistic effects which diminished the individual drug anti-cancer efficacy. These observations have significant practical implications in the understanding of anti-cancer drug mechanism that can facilitate clinical practice of better drug combinations.""","""['Xiaolong Jia', 'Yiyang Li', 'Alok Sharma', 'Yulong Li', 'Guohai Xie', 'Guoyao Wang', 'Junhui Jiang', 'Yue Cheng', 'Xianting Ding']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Comput Biol Chem""","""['Ciprofloxacin sensitizes hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines to doxorubicin and docetaxel treatment on a schedule-dependent manner.', 'Combination treatment with fulvestrant and various cytotoxic agents (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and 5-fluorouracil) has a synergistic effect in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.', 'In vitro search for synergy and antagonism: evaluation of docetaxel combinations in breast cancer cell lines.', 'Docetaxel in combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.', 'Preclinical mechanisms of action of docetaxel and docetaxel combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Murine pharmacokinetics and antimalarial pharmacodynamics of dihydroartemisinin trimer self-assembled nanoparticles.', 'In vivo antimalarial activity and pharmacokinetics of artelinic acid-choline derivative liposomes in rodents.', 'Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) Inhibitors Sensitize Topoisomerase II Inhibitors in Killing Prostate Cancer Through PDE5-Independent Impairment of HR and NHEJ DNA Repair Systems.', 'Searching Synergistic Dose Combinations for Anticancer Drugs.']"""

However, commonly used PS induce death but also resistance pathways in cancer cells and an alteration of surrounding normal tissues. Because polyamines (PA) are actively accumulated in cancer cells by the Polyamine Transport System (PTS), they may enable PS to specifically target cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether new protoporphyrin IX-polyamine derivatives were effective PS against prostate cancer and whether PA increased PDT specificity after 630nm irradiation.  Methods:   CHO and CHO-MG cells (differing in their PTS activity) were used to assess efficacy of polyamine vectorization. MTT assays were performed on human prostate non-malignant (RWPE-1) and malignant (PC-3, DU 145 and LNCaP) cell lines to test PS phototoxicity. ROS generation, DNA fragmentation and cell signalling were assessed by ELISA/EIA, western-blots and gel shift assays. Finally, PS effects were studied on tumor growth in nude mice.  Results:   Our PS were more effective on cancer cells compared to non-malignant cells and more effective than PpIX alone. PpIX-PA generated ROS production involved in induction of apoptotic intrinsic pathways. Different pathways involved in apoptosis resistance were studied: PS inhibited Bcl-2, Akt, and NF-κB but activated p38/COX-2/PGE2 pathways which were not implicated in apoptosis resistance in our model. In vivo experiments showed PpIX-PA efficacy was greater than results obtained with PpIX.  Conclusions:   All together, our results showed that PpIX-PA exerted its maximum effects without activating resistance pathways and appears to be a good candidate for prostate cancer PDT treatment.""","""['Chloë Fidanzi-Dugas', 'Bertrand Liagre', 'Guillaume Chemin', 'Aurélie Perraud', 'Claire Carrion', 'Claude-Yves Couquet', 'Robert Granet', 'Vincent Sol', 'David Yannick Léger']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj""","""['Development of a functionalized UV-emitting nanocomposite for the treatment of cancer using indirect photodynamic therapy.', 'The synthesis of 64Cu-chelated porphyrin photosensitizers and their tumor-targeting peptide conjugates for the evaluation of target cell uptake and PET image-based pharmacokinetics of targeted photodynamic therapy agents.', 'The inhibition of ferrochelatase enhances 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic action for prostate cancer.', 'Multiple Means by Which Nitric Oxide can Antagonize Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Photosensitizers in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Emerging photodynamic/sonodynamic therapies for urological cancers: progress and challenges.', 'Recent Advances in Fluorescent Methods for Polyamine Detection and the Polyamine Suppressing Strategy in Tumor Treatment.', 'Evaluation of Ruthenium-Based Assemblies as Carriers of Photosensitizers to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis by Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Chemical approaches for the enhancement of porphyrin skeleton-based photodynamic therapy.']"""

In present study, we aimed to identify lncRNA expression signature that can predict biochemical recurrence-free (BCR-free) survival of prostate cancer (PCa) patients.  Methods:   A total of 291 patients with pathologic confirmed PCa in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset were recruited and included. With the specific risk score formula, patients were further classified into high-risk group and low-risk group. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the association between lncRNA signature and survival outcomes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out to identify the potentially associated biological processes and signaling pathway.  Results:   Overall, 126 differentially expressed lncRNAs were found with more than twofold changes and p value of FDR <0.01. Among which, four lncRNAs were identified to be significantly associated with BCR-free survival. Then, using a risk score based on the signature of these four lncRNAs, we divided the patients into low-risk and high-risk groups with significantly different BCR-free survival and disease-free survival. Further multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the four-lncRNA signature was independent of age, AJCC T stage, lymphonodus status, Gleason score, margin and adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. GSEA suggested that this signature was involved in cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   In present study, a novel four-lncRNA signature that is useful in survival prediction in PCa patients was developed. If validated, this lncRNA signature might assist in selecting high-risk subpopulation who need more aggressive therapeutic intervention.

Results:   The mean values of TTPN in the AA and Enz groups were 19 and 14 weeks, respectively. Despite the lack of significant differences in several parameters according to the mean TTPN in the Enz group, patients with TTPN>19 weeks were characterized by longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy, better performance status, lower incidence of bone metastasis, lower value of nadir PSA, and higher incidence of PSA response than those with TTPN ≤19 weeks in the AA group.

Here we suggest varying diffusion time, t, to study time-dependent D(t) in prostate cancer, thereby adding an extra dimension in the development of prostate cancer biomarkers.  Methods:   Thirty-eight patients with peripheral zone prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI using an external-array coil and a diffusion-weighted image sequence acquired for b = 0, as well as along 12 noncollinear gradient directions for b = 500 s/mm using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For this sequence, 6 diffusion times ranging from 20.8 to 350 milliseconds were acquired. Tumors were classified as low-grade (Gleason score [GS] 3 + 3; n = 11), intermediate-grade (GS 3 + 4; n = 16), and high-grade (GS ≥4 + 3; n = 11). Benign peripheral zone and transition zone were also studied.  Results:   Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) D(t) decreased with increasing t in all zones of the prostate, though the rate of decay in D(t) was different between sampled zones. Analysis of variance and area under the curve analyses suggested better differentiation of tumor grades at shorter t. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with t for all regions of interest. On average, highest FA was observed within GS 3 + 3 tumors.  Conclusions:   There is a measurable time dependence of ADC in prostate cancer, which is dependent on the underlying tissue and Gleason score. Therefore, there may be an optimal selection of t for prediction of tumor grade using ADC. Controlling t should allow ADC to achieve greater reproducibility between different sites and vendors. Intentionally varying t enables targeted exploration of D(t), a previously overlooked biophysical phenomenon in the prostate.

We identified 101 heterozygous carriers of G84E who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer between 1985 and 2011 and matched these men by race, age and tumor grade to 99 HOXB13 wild-type controls. Immunostaining for HOXB13, PTEN, ERG, p53 and SPINK1 as well as RNA in situ hybridization for ETV1/4/5 were performed using genetically validated assays. Tumors from G84E carriers generally expressed HOXB13 protein at a level comparable to benign and wild-type glands. ETS gene expression (either ERG or ETV1/4/5) was seen in 36% (36/101) of tumors from G84E carriers compared to 68% (65/96) of the controls (p < 0.0001). PTEN was lost in 11% (11/101) of G84E carriers compared to 25% (25/99) of the controls (p = 0.014). PTEN loss was enriched among ERG-positive compared to ERG-negative tumors in both groups of patients. Nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein, indicative of underlying TP53 missense mutations, was uncommon in both groups, occurring in 1% (1/101) of the G84E carriers versus 2% (2/92) of the controls (p = NS).

Dual- or multiple-targeting probes, using radiolabeled metal chelates conjugated to peptides, have potential advantages over single-targeting probes as they can recognize multiple targets leading to better sensitivity for imaging and radiotherapy when target heterogeneity is present. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and Y1, are specifically interesting as their expression is upregulated in most breast and prostate cancers. One of our goals has been to develop a dual-target probe that can bind both GRP and Y1 receptors. Consequently, a heterobivalent dual-target probe, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A (where a GRP targeting ligand J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH2 and Y1 targeting ligand INP-K [ɛ-J-(α-DO3A-ɛ-DGa)-K] YRLRY-NH2 were coupled), that recognizes both GRP and Y1 receptors was synthesized, purified, and characterized in the past. Competitive displacement cell binding assay studies with the probe demonstrated strong affinity (IC50 values given in parentheses) for GRP receptors in T-47D cells (18 ± 0.7 nM) and for Y1 receptors in MCF7 cells (80 ± 11 nM). As a further evaluation of the heterobivalent dual-target probe t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A, the objective of this study was to determine its mouse and human serum stability at 37°C. The in vitro metabolic degradation of the dual-target probe in mouse and human serum was studied by using a 153Gd-labeled t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A and a high-performance liquid chromatography/radioisotope detector analytical method. The half-life (t1/2) of degradation of the dual-target probe in mouse serum was calculated as 7 hours and only ∼20% degradation was seen after 6 hours incubation in human serum. The slow in vitro metabolic degradation of the dual-target probe can be compared with the degradation t1/2 of the corresponding monomeric probes, BVD15-DO3A and AMBA: 15, and ∼40 minutes for BVD15-DO3A and 3.1 and 38.8 hours for AMBA in mouse and human serum, respectively. A possible pathway for in vitro metabolic degradation of the t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A in mouse serum is proposed based on the chromatographic retention times of the intact probe and its degradants.""","""['Arijit Ghosh', 'Natarajan Raju', 'Michael Tweedle', 'Krishan Kumar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Heterobivalent dual-target probe for targeting GRP and Y1 receptors on tumor cells.', 'Preclinical evaluation of a new bombesin analog for imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptors.', 'Synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of a high-affinity and metabolically stabilized 18F-labeled bombesin analogue for molecular imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'Is there a role for agonist gastrin-releasing peptide receptor radioligands in tumour imaging?', 'Lutetium-177 Labeled Bombesin Peptides for Radionuclide Therapy.', 'Peptide-Based Strategies for Targeted Tumor Treatment and Imaging.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', ""Preformulation Studies of a Stable PTEN-PDZ Lipopeptide Able to Cross an In Vitro Blood-Brain-Barrier Model as a Potential Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Identification of a Suitable Peptidic Molecular Platform for the Development of NPY(Y1 )R-Specific Imaging Agents.']"""

We demonstrated that NP AR-shRNA enhances PCa radiosensitivity as indicated by the inhibition of cell growth, increased apoptosis, and increased cell cycle arrest in AR-dependent HIPC in vitro. The radiosensitizing effect of NP AR-shRNA could be validated in vivo, as NP AR-shRNA significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the survival of HIPC tumor-bearing mice. Analysis at the molecular level revealed that NP AR-shRNA inhibits DNA damage repair signaling pathways. Our study supports further investigation of NP AR-shRNA for the improvement of radiotherapy efficacy in HIPC.""","""['Xinjun Zhang', 'Nianli Liu', 'ZhiYing Shao', 'Hui Qiu', 'Hong Yao', 'JiaYin Ji', 'Jianshe Wang', 'Wenchao Lu', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Longzhen Zhang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nanomedicine""","""['Nanoparticle formulation of small DNA molecules, Dbait, improves the sensitivity of hormone-independent prostate cancer to radiotherapy.', 'Adeno-associated virus-delivered short hairpin-structured RNA for androgen receptor gene silencing induces tumor eradication of prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice: a preclinical study.', 'Cyclin D1 silencing suppresses tumorigenicity, impairs DNA double strand break repair and thus radiosensitizes androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to DNA damage.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Targeting androgen receptor-independent pathways in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current advances in nanoformulations of therapeutic agents targeting tumor microenvironment to overcome drug resistance.', 'The Promise of Nanoparticles-Based Radiotherapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'Development and Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeted Nanosystem Co-Packaging Docetaxel and Androgen Receptor siRNA for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Recent Development of Gold Nanoparticles as Contrast Agents for Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen targeted gold nanoparticles for prostate cancer radiotherapy: does size matter for targeted particles?']"""

Patients and methods:   Between May 2012 and October 2015, 124 lesions were treated in 94 patients with a median dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions. Seventy patients were treated for a single lesion and 25 for > 1 lesion. In 34 patients androgen deprivation (AD) was combined with SBRT. We evaluated biochemical response according to PSA level every 3 months after SBRT: a 3-month PSA decrease from pre-SBRT PSA of more than 10% identified responder patients. In case of PSA level increase, imaging was performed to evaluate clinical progression. Toxicity was assessed every 6 to 9 months after SBRT.  Results:   Median follow-up was 18.5 months. In 13 patients (14%) Grade 1 to 2 toxicity was reported without any Grade 3 to 4 toxicity. Biochemical response, stabilization, and progression were observed in 64 (68%), 10 (11%), and 20 (21%) of 94 evaluable patients. Clinical progression was observed in 31 patients (33%) after a median time of 8.1 months. In-field progression occurred in 12 lesions (9.7%). Two-year local control and PFS rates were 84% and 30%, respectively. Age older than 75 years correlated with better biochemical response rate. Age older than 75 years, concomitant AD administered up to 12 months, and pelvic LN involvement correlated with longer PFS.  Conclusion:   SBRT is safe and offers good in-field control.

This analysis is an extended followup of our initial report, with favorable early biochemical control rate (biochemical nonevidence of disease) of 97% at 4 years.  Methods and materials:   Three hundred fifty-seven evaluable patients with FR and IR prostate cancer underwent real-time IO-PSI (iodine-125/145 Gy or palladium-103/120 Gy) between 2001 and 2013.  Results:   With a median followup of 54 months (range, 24-110 months), the absolute biochemical failure free survival of disease was 96%. The 8-year actuarial probability of prostate-specific antigen failure-free survival for FR and IR cohorts was 92.4% and 87%, respectively.

Methods:   Eighty-two patients received EBRT in 23 fractions of 2 Gy and HDR-BT TG43 in three fractions of 6.5 Gy. The HDR-BT CT was deformably registered to the EBRT CT. The rectum D0.1cc , D1cc , D2cc and D10cc were calculated in two ways. (i) Parameter-adding: the EBRT DVH parameters (or the EBRT prescription dose) were added to the unregistered HDR-BT DVH parameters.

However, it remains largely unexplored whether metabolic reprogramming is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. In this study, we found that histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) dysregulated in PCa development regulated cellular growth and aerobic glycolysis through miR-181b/hexokinase 2 (HK2) axis. Aberrant expression profiles of coding RNA and microRNA were examined by two large, independent clinical prostate cancer data sets. The results indicated that EZH2 expression was elevated followed by PCa development. A set of glycometabolism-related genes were positively correlated with EZH2 expression such as HK2.The depletion of EZH2 in cell experiments inhibited PCa cell growth and aerobic glycolysis accompanying the up-regulation of miR-181b. Western blot and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-181b inversely modulated HK2 by directly targeting the binding site within 3'-untranslated regions. Moreover, decreased miR-181b expression largely abrogated the effect of sh-EZH2 on HK2 expression and HK2-induced glucose metabolism process. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (ISH) analysis further revealed a significant correlation in EZH2, miR-181b and HK2 expression in nude mouse tumor xenograft. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that EZH2/miR-181b/HK2 pathway plays a positive role in PCa development. Targeting this aberrantly activated pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy against PCa.""","""['Tao Tao', 'Ming Chen', 'Ranran Jiang', 'Han Guan', 'Yeqing Huang', 'Huan Su', 'Qiang Hu', 'Xu Han', 'Jun Xiao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development.', 'MiR-124 induces autophagy-related cell death in cholangiocarcinoma cells through direct targeting of the EZH2-STAT3 signaling axis.', 'EZH2 in Cancer Progression and Potential Application in Cancer Therapy: A Friend or Foe?', 'Functional and therapeutic significance of EZH2 in urological cancers.', 'Construction of lncRNA/Pseudogene-miRNA Network Based on In Silico Approaches for Glycolysis Pathway to Identify Prostate Adenocarcinoma-Related Potential Biomarkers.', 'Identification of a polycomb group-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Hypoxia-mediated promotion of glucose metabolism in non-small cell lung cancer correlates with activation of the EZH2/FBXL7/PFKFB4 axis.', 'miR-144-3p represses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by affecting cell aerobic glycolysis via FOXK1.', 'Multiomics characteristics and immunotherapeutic potential of EZH2 in pan-cancer.']"""

FOXM1 is a cell proliferation-specific transcription factor highly expressed in PCa cells compared to non-malignant prostate epithelial cells, suggesting that the aberrant overexpression of FOXM1 contributes to PCa development. In addition to regulating AR gene transcription and cell cycle-regulatory genes, FOXM1 selectively regulates the gene transcription of KLK2 and PSA, typical androgen responsive genes. Screening the potential FOXM1-binding sites by ChIP-PCR, we found that FOXM1 directly binds to the FHK binding motifs in the PSA promoter/enhancer regions. AI C4-2 cells have more FOXM1 binding sites than androgen dependent LNCaP cells. The depletion of FOXM1 by small molecular inhibitors significantly improves the suppression of PSA gene transcription by the anti-AR agent Cadosax.

First, to investigate suitable target sizes for the MLC mode, MLC and CC plans were generated using computed tomography (CT) images from 5 patients for 1, 3, 5 and 7 cm diameter targets. Second, MLC and CC plans were compared in 10 patients, each with liver and prostate targets. For brain targets, doses to the brain could be spared in MLC plans better than in CC plans (P ≤ 0.02). The MLC mode also achieved more uniform dose delivery to the targets. The conformity index in MLC plans was stable, irrespective of the target size (P = 0.5). For patients with liver tumors, the MLC mode achieved higher target coverage than the CC mode (P = 0.04). For prostate tumors, doses to the rectum and the conformity index were lowered in MLC plans compared with in CC plans (P ≤ 0.04). In all target plans, treatment times in MLC plans were shorter than those in CC plans (P < 0.001). The newly introduced MLC technology can reduce treatment time and provide favorable or comparable dose distribution for 1-7 cm targets. In particular, the MLC mode has dosimetric advantage for targets near organs at risk. Therefore, the MLC mode is recommended as the first option in stereotactic body radiotherapy.""","""['Taro Murai', 'Yukiko Hattori', 'Chikao Sugie', 'Hiromitsu Iwata', 'Michio Iwabuchi', 'Yuta Shibamoto']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Investigating the clinical advantages of a robotic linac equipped with a multileaf collimator in the treatment of brain and prostate cancer patients.', 'Impact of collimator leaf width and treatment technique on stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy plans for intra- and extracranial lesions.', 'Impact of collimator leaf width on stereotactic radiosurgery and 3D conformal radiotherapy treatment plans.', 'Plan Quality and Secondary Cancer Risk Assessment in Patients with Benign Intracranial Lesions after Radiosurgery using the CyberKnife M6 Robotic Radiosurgery System.', 'The application of the multileaf collimator in radiotherapy: the dosimetric problems and the technical implications for its clinical use.', 'Development of raster scanning IMRT using a robotic radiosurgery system.', 'Effects of Multileaf Collimator Design and Function When Using an Optimized Dynamic Conformal Arc Approach for Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treatment of Multiple Brain Metastases With a Single Isocenter: A Planning Study.', 'Efficacy of herbal medicine TJ-14 for acute radiation-induced enteritis: a multi-institutional prospective Phase II trial.', 'A Literature Review of Proton Beam Therapy for Prostate Cancer in Japan.']"""

Methods:   Fifty-six patients with histologically proven PZ PCa who underwent DWI-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using 21 b-values (0-4500 s/mm2) were included. The mean signal intensities of the regions of interest (ROIs) placed in benign PZs and cancerous tissues on DWI images were fitted using mono-exponential, bi-exponential, stretched-exponential, and kurtosis models. The b-values were divided into four ranges: 0-1000, 0-2000, 0-3200, and 0-4500 s/mm2, grouped as A, B, C, and D, respectively. ADC, <D>, D*, f, DDC, α, Dapp, and Kapp were estimated for each group. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated to measure goodness-of-fit. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the parameters.  Results:   All parameters except D* showed significant differences between cancerous tissues and benign PZs in each group. The area under the curve values (AUCs) of ADC were comparable in groups C and D (p = 0.980) and were significantly higher than those in groups A and B (p< 0.05 for all). The AUCs of ADC and Kapp in groups B and C were similar (p = 0.07 and p = 0.954), and were significantly higher than the other parameters (p< 0.001 for all).

Objectives:   This article presents a summary of the I Brazilian Consensus on Advanced Prostate Cancer, conducted by the Brazilian Society of Urology and Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology.  Materials and methods:   Experts were selected by the medical societies involved. Forty issues regarding controversial issues in advanced disease were previously elaborated. The panel met for consensus, with a threshold established for 2/3 of the participants.  Results and conclusions:   The treatment of advanced prostate cancer is complex, due to the existence of a large number of therapies, with different response profiles and toxicities. The panel addressed recommendations on preferred choice of therapies, indicators that would justify their change, and indicated some strategies for better sequencing of treatment in order to maximize the potential for disease control with the available therapeutic arsenal.

Materials and methods:   For phantom measurements a dedicated DWI phantom with different sucrose concentrations was used. In addition, 10 volunteers and 16 patients with suspected prostate cancer were examined for in vivo measurements. All examinations were performed with a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. A prototype simultaneous multislice EPI sequence (DW-EPISMS ; acquisition time 3:14 min) was acquired and compared to a single-shot EPI sequence (DW-EPISS ; acquisition time 6:12 min) serving as a standard of reference. Different image quality parameters of EPISMS were assessed qualitatively (overall image quality, anatomic differentiability, lesion conspicuity, image noise, distortion; two independent readers; 5-point Likert-scale [5 = excellent]) and quantitatively (ADC-values by calculating interclass correlation [ICC] and Bland-Altman limits of agreement [LoA] as measures for reproducibility) and compared to DW-EPISS .  Results:   DW-EPISMS allowed for a substantially reduced acquisition time as compared to DW-EPISS (˜50%). Bland-Altman plots revealed robust measurement repeatability for DW-EPISMS in the phantom study. Overall image quality did not significantly differ between DW-EPISMS and DW-EPISS (b1500 images P = 0.5; ADC maps P = 0.7). Only in b1500 DW images was subjective image noise rated significantly higher in DW-EPISS than in DW-EPISMS (P = 0.006). Quantitative analysis of ADC-values revealed not significant differences between DW-EPISMS and DW-EPISS (P = 0.7) and high measures for reproducibility ICC ≥0.96.  Conclusion:   Simultaneous multislice DWI is feasible for accelerated prostate MRI allowing for a substantially reduced examination time with similar image quality and ADC-values as compared to a standard of reference DWI sequence.

Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we assessed the relative risk (RR) for any cancer in families with increasing numbers of first-degree relatives diagnosed with melanoma, including multiple melanoma, and in reverse order RR for melanoma in families of multiple discordant cancers. Close to 9% of melanoma was familial; among these 92% were in 2-case families and 8% in families with 3 cases or more. Cancers that were associated with melanoma, in at least two independent analyses, included breast, prostate, colorectal, skin and nervous system cancers. Other associations included cancer of unknown primary, acute myeloid leukemia/myelofibrosis and Waldenström macroglobulinemia/myeloma. Significant results, which appear biologically plausible, were also obtained for rare nasal melanoma and mesothelioma.

Through tissue deformation and relaxation, this causes target and risk organ displacement and drift. In this study, prefraction shift and intrafraction drift of the prostate are quantified during robotic transperineal 4DUS.  Methods:   The position of the prostate was recorded for different positions of the probe before treatment in 10 patients (16 series of measurements). During treatment (15 patients, 273 fractions), intrafraction motion of the prostate was tracked (total of 27 h and 24 min) with the transperineal probe in place.  Results:   Per 1 mm shift of the US probe in the cranial direction, a displacement of the prostate by 0.42 ± 0.09 mm in the cranial direction was detected. The relationship was found to be linear (R² = 0.97) and highly significant (p < 0.0001). After initial contact of the probe and the perineum (no pressure), a shift of the probe of about 5-10 mm was typically necessary to achieve good image quality, corresponding to a shift of the prostate of about 2-4 mm in the cranial direction. Tissue compression and prostate displacement were well visible. During treatment, the prostate drifted at an average rate of 0.075 mm/min in the cranial direction (p = 0.0014).  Conclusion:   The pressure applied by a perineal US probe has a quantitatively similar impact on prostate displacement as transabdominal pressure. Shifts are predominantly in the cranial direction (typically 2-4 mm) with some component in the anterior direction (typically <1 mm). Slight probe pressure can improve image quality, but excessive probe pressure can distort the surrounding anatomy and potentially move risk organs closer to the high-dose area.""","""['Minglun Li', 'Nina-Sophie Hegemann', 'Farkhad Manapov', 'Anne Kolberg', 'Patrick Dominik Thum', 'Ute Ganswindt', 'Claus Belka', 'Hendrik Ballhausen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Changes in penile bulb dose when using the Clarity transperineal ultrasound probe: A planning study.', 'A Monte Carlo study of the effect of an ultrasound transducer on surface dose during intrafraction motion imaging for external beam radiation therapy.', 'Online ultrasound image guidance for radiotherapy of prostate cancer: impact of image acquisition on prostate displacement.', 'Ultrasound-based guidance of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Impact of transperineal ultrasound on perineal skin dose in prostate radiation therapy.', 'The ProMotion LMU dataset (2022 edition), prostate intra-fraction motion recorded by transperineal ultrasound.', 'Distance Between the Tumour and Nipple as a Predictor of Axillary Lymph Node Involvement in Breast Cancer.', 'The ProMotion LMU dataset, prostate intra-fraction motion recorded by transperineal ultrasound.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.']"""

The ESCRT machinery (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) and Rab-proteins act as key players in vesicular trafficking and secretion. Yet, their role in prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the relevance of these components in PCa. In silico reanalysis of genes with known involvement in vesicular trafficking and secretion in an existing microarray dataset revealed low expression of RAB27A, RAB27B and VPS36 to be predictive for reduced BCR-free survival in patients with localized PCa (p=0.033, 0.025 and 0.005). In the same microarray dataset underexpression of RAB27A, RAB27B and VPS36 was seen in distant metastases (p<0.001; p=0.003; p<0.001). This was consistent in two further microarray datasets. qRT-PCR-validation in two independent cohorts of PCa specimens (n=90) showed low expression of VPS36 in PCa tissue (p=0.023), especially in castration-resistant tumors (p=0.002). In all five datasets there were significant correlations between the expression of at least two of the candidates. Upon knockdown of VPS36 an increase of RAB27A and RAB27B expression, but not vice versa, was observed in both prostate and breast cancer cells (PC3, MDA-MB‑231). In PC3 cell knockdown of RAB27B and VPS36 dramatically reduced colony formation (-52.2%, p<0.001; -71.1%, p<0.001) and, controversial to reports in other tumor entities, increased the release of extracellular particles (+25.3%, p=0.014; +45.6%, p<0.001). Taken together RAB27A, RAB27B and VPS36 are frequently underexpressed in advanced PCa and are inversely correlated with PCa outcome. There seems to be a close relationship in the expression of RAB27A, RAB27B and VPS36, with RAB27A and RAB27B being dependent on VPS36.

Method and materials:   Manually drawn contours and autosegmented ROIs were created for 167 CT image sets acquired from 19 prostate patients. Autosegmentation was performed utilizing Pinnacle's Smart Probabilistic Image Contouring Engine. For each CT set, 78 Gy/39 fraction 7-beam IMRT treatment plans with 1 cm CTV-to-PTV margins were created for each of the three contour scenarios; PMD using manually delineated (MD) ROIs, PAS using autosegmented ROIs, and PAM using autosegmented organ-at-risks (OAR)s and the manually drawn target. For each plan, 1000 virtual treatment simulations with different systematic errors for each simulation and a different random error for each fraction were performed. The statistical probability of achieving dose-volume metrics (coverage probability (CP)), expectation values for normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP) metrics for all possible cross-evaluation pairs of ROI types and planning scenarios were reported. In evaluation scenarios, the root mean square loss (RMSL) and maximum absolute loss (MAL) of coverage probability of dose-volume objectives, E[TCP], and E[NTCP] were compared with respect to the base plan created and evaluated with manually drawn contours.  Results:   Femoral head dose objectives were satisfied in all situations, as well as the maximum dose objectives for all ROIs. Bladder metrics were within the clinical coverage tolerances except D35Gy for the autosegmented plan evaluated with the manual contours. Dosimetric indices for CTV and rectum could be highly compromised when the definition of the ROIs switched from manually delineated to autosegmented. Seventy-two percent of CT image sets satisfied the worst-case CP thresholds for all dosimetric objectives in all scenarios, the percentage dropped to 50% if biological indices were taken into account. Among evaluation scenarios, (MD,PAM ) bore the highest resemblance to (MD,PMD ) where 99% and 88% of cases met all CP thresholds for bladder and rectum, respectively.  Conclusions:   When including daily setup variations in prostate IMRT, the dose-volume metric CP, and biological indices of ROIs were approximately equivalent for the plans created based on manually drawn targets and autosegmented OARs in 88% of cases. The accuracy of autosegmented prostates and rectums are impediment to attain statistically equivalent plans created based on manually drawn ROIs.""","""['Hamidreza Nourzadeh', 'William T Watkins', 'Mahmoud Ahmed', 'Cheukkai Hui', 'David Schlesinger', 'Jeffrey V Siebers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Coverage-based treatment planning to accommodate delineation uncertainties in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Dosimetric comparison between 2-dimensional radiation therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy in treatment of advanced T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: to treat less or more in the planning organ-at-risk volume of the brainstem and spinal cord.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Impact of random outliers in auto-segmented targets on radiotherapy treatment plans for glioblastoma.', 'Auto-segmentation for total marrow irradiation.', 'Dosimetric comparison of automatically propagated prostate contours with manually drawn contours in MRI-guided radiotherapy: A step towards a contouring free workflow?', 'Dose escalation in the definite target volume.', 'Quantifying the dosimetric impact of organ-at-risk delineation variability in head and neck radiation therapy in the context of patient setup uncertainty.']"""

How soon after radiotherapy one can expect an improvement in QOL is unknown.  Objective:   To investigate QOL at days 10 and 42 after radiotherapy with a bone metastases-specific QOL tool.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this secondary analysis of the NCIC Clinical Trials Group Symptom Control Trial SC.23, a double-blind randomized clinical trial that investigated dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of pain flare after radiotherapy, patients were accrued from 23 Canadian centers from May 30, 2011, to December 11, 2014, and were followed up for 42 days after treatment. Participants referred for radiotherapy for bone metastases were required to have a pain score at the site(s) of treatment of at least 2 (range, 0-10).  Interventions:   Patients were treated with a single 8-Gy radiotherapy dose for 1 or 2 bone metastases.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patients reported their worst pain score and analgesic intake at baseline and days 10 and 42 after treatment. Pain response was assessed with International Bone Metastases Consensus Endpoint Definitions. Self-reported QOL was completed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Bone Metastases Module (QLQ-BM22) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL) at the same time points.  Results:   A total of 298 patients were accrued (median age, 68.8 [range, 32-94] years at day 10 and 68.0 [range, 34-90] years at day 42). A total of 122 patients (40.9%) responded to radiotherapy at day 10 and 116 patients (38.9%) at day 42. At day 10, compared with nonresponders, patients with a pain response had a greater reduction in pain (mean reduction, 17.0 vs 1.8; P = .002) and pain characteristics (mean reduction, 12.8 vs 1.1; P = .002), as well as greater improvements in functional interference (mean increase, 11.6 vs 3.6; P = .01) and psychosocial aspects (mean increase, 1.2 points in responders vs mean decrease of 2.2 points in nonresponders, P = .04). Comparing changes in QOL from baseline to day 42, responders had significantly greater improvements in the physical (mean increase, 6.2 vs -9.0; P < .001), emotional (mean increase, 12.3 vs -5.5; P < .001), and global domains (mean increase, 10.3 vs -4.5; P < .001) of the QLQ-C15-PAL compared with nonresponders.  Conclusions and relevance:   Forty percent of patients experienced pain reduction and better QOL at day 10 after radiotherapy with further improvements in QOL at day 42 in responders.

Methods:   Increasing concentrations of PLEO (0.01-0.1% v/v, 80-800 μg/ml) were administered to a wide variety of cultured cancer cells from breast, cervix, colon, liver, lung, prostate, and thyroid carcinomas. Fibroblasts were also included as healthy control cells. Cell viability was monitored by WST-8 assay up to 72 hours after PLEO administration. The intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the induction of apoptosis, and the enhancement of chemotherapeutic drug cytotoxicity by PLEO were further investigated in the most responsive cancer cell line.  Results:   A dose-dependent reduction of tumor cell viability was observed upon PLEO exposure; while no cytotoxic effect was revealed in healthy fibroblasts. FTC-133 thyroid cancer cells were found to be the most sensitive cells to PLEO treatment; accordingly, an intracellular accumulation of ROS and an activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were evidenced in FTC-133 cells after PLEO administration. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of the antineoplastic drugs cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and etoposide was enhanced in PLEO-exposed FTC-133 cells.

BPH-1 cells, alone or with fibroblasts (c-Jun+/+ or c-Jun-/-), were implanted subcutaneously in male nude mice who were then treated with finasteride. The degrees of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and sizes of the xenografts were determined. BPH-1 cells were grown alone or co-cultured with mouse fibroblasts in the presence of finasteride and the level of IGF-1 secreted into the medium by the fibroblasts was determined. The proliferation-associated signaling pathway in BPH-1 cells was also evaluated. Fibroblasts and c-Jun promoted xenograft growth, stimulated Ki-67 expression, and inhibited BPH-1 apoptosis. Finasteride did not induce the shrinkage of xenografts in the combined-grafted groups despite repressing Ki-67 expression and inducing cell apoptosis. The addition of c-Jun-/- fibroblasts did not promote xenograft growth. In the absence of c-Jun and fibroblasts, finasteride did not alter xenograft growth, Ki-67 expression, or cell apoptosis. The in vitro results demonstrated that when BPH-1 cells were grown in monoculture, treatment with finasteride did not induce cell death and stimulated the expression of pro-proliferative signaling molecules, while in the presence of fibroblasts containing c-Jun, finasteride treatment repressed epithelial cell proliferation, the level of IGF-1 in the medium, and the activation of downstream pro-proliferative signaling pathways.

Methods:   We pooled two prospective cohort studies: NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, with data on 409 796 individuals (633 EA, 415 GCA).

Methods:   We identified patients>65 years of age with early-stage lung cancer diagnosed 1996-2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Prior cancers were characterized by type, stage, and timing with respect to the lung cancer diagnosis. All-cause and lung cancer specific-survival rates were compared between patients with and without prior cancer using Cox regression analyses and propensity scores.  Results:   Among 42,910 patients with early-stage lung cancer, one-fifth (21%) had a prior cancer. The most common prior cancers were prostate (21%), breast (18%), gastrointestinal (17%), and other genitourinary (15%). Most prior cancers were localized, and 61% were diagnosed within 5 years of the lung cancer diagnosis. There was no difference in all-cause survival between patients with and without prior cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; P=0.52). Lung cancer specific survival was improved among patients with prior cancer (HR 0.79; P<0.001).

Methods:   Using a PC-3 cell model, in vitro assays were performed to evaluate the effects of celastrol on proliferation, migration (wound healing assay), tissues invasion (Transwell-Matrigel penetration assay) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). An intra-tibia injection mouse model was used to assess the effect of celastrol on PCa bone metastasis in vivo.  Results:   Pretreatment with celastrol significantly reduced proliferation of PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner and cell migration was much slower than in controls. Significantly fewer cells penetrated the gel-membrane after celastrol administration and their skeletal invasive ability was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, a significant, dose-dependent decrease in VEGF secretion was observed. In the in vivo mouse model, pretreatment with celastrol (8 μmol l-1) inhibited the tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells so that almost no bone invasion occurred as compared with control injections. Histological examinations using hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that tibiae injected with celastrol pretreated PC-3 cells retained their natural bone structure.

However, additional factors which could influence the clinical outcome of the patients through modulating these steroid signalings have also been proposed. Among these, increased expression of serotonin receptor especially that of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor Type 4 (5-HTR4) has been recently proposed to be involved in autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer, but the presence and clinical significance of 5-HTR4 in hormone-naive prostate cancer (HNPC) and its interaction with hormonal signaling pathways have remained virtually unknown.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the status of 5-HTR4 in 112 human HNPC cases (acinar adenocarcinoma) using immunohistochemistry and correlated the findings with clinicopathological features of individual patients and the status of androgen receptor (AR) and ERβ. To further elucidate its underlying mechanisms, androgen-dependent human prostate carcinoma cell line, LNCaP, expressing 5-HTR4, was treated by 5-HTR4 agonist.  Results:   5-HTR4 immunoreactivity was detected in 34% of prostate cancer cases examined (38/112) and was significantly correlated with the status of ERβ but not with that of AR and other clinicopathological factors of the patients. Results of in vitro studies demonstrated that 24 h incubation with 5-HTR4 agonist (10 nM) increased the expression level of ERβ messenger RNA compared to controls. 5-HTR4 agonist (100 nM) significantly inhibited LNCaP carcinoma cell migration (P < 0.05).

Vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide with an endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effect in normal and pathological tissues. AVP receptors are present in human lung, breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and gastrointestinal tumors. While AVP V1 receptors are associated with stimulation of cellular proliferation, AVP V2 receptor (V2r) is related to antiproliferative effects. Desmopressin (dDAVP) is a synthetic analog of AVP that acts as a selective agonist for the V2r, which shows antitumor properties in breast and colorectal cancer models. Recently, we developed a derivative of dDAVP named [V4Q5]dDAVP, which presents higher antitumor effects in a breast cancer model compared to the parental compound. The goal of present work was to explore the antitumor properties of the V2r agonist dDAVP and its novel analog [V4Q5]dDAVP on aggressive human lung (NCI-H82) and prostate cancer (PC-3) cell lines with neuroendocrine (NE) characteristics. We study the presence of specific NE markers (CgA and NSE) and V2r expression in NCI-H82 and PC-3. Both cell lines express high levels of NE markers NSE and CgA but then incubation with dDAVP diminished expression levels of both markers. DDAVP and [V4Q5]dDAVP significantly reduced proliferation, doubling time, and migration in both tumor cell cultures. [V4Q5]dDAVP analog showed a higher cytostatic effect than dDAVP, on cellular proliferation in the NCI-H82 cell line. Silencing of V2r using small interfering RNA significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of [V4Q5]dDAVP on NCI-H82 cell proliferation. We, preliminarily, explored the in vivo effect of dDAVP and [V4Q5]dDAVP on NCI-H82 small cell lung cancer xenografts. Treated tumors (0.3 μg kg-1, thrice a week) grew slower in comparison to vehicle-treated animals.

Mechanistically, we find that the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and IPO11 cargo, UBE2E1, is a limiting factor for PTEN degradation. Using in vitro and in vivo gene-targeting methods, we show that Ipo11 loss results in degradation of Pten, lung adenocarcinoma, and neoplasia in mouse prostate with aberrantly high levels of Ube2e1 in the cytoplasm. These findings explain the correlation between loss of IPO11 and PTEN protein in human lung tumors.

The availability of simple, efficient and reproducible radiolabeling procedures is essential for developing new SPECT radiopharmaceuticals for clinical translation. The aim of this research was to prepare 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Lys(Nal)-Urea-Glu (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA) obtained from lyophilized kit formulations and evaluate the in vitro and in vivo radiopharmaceutical binding to prostate cancer cells over-expressing PSMA, as well as the 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA normal biodistribution in humans and the preliminary uptake in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods: 99mTc labeling was performed by adding sodium pertechnetate solution and a 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to a lyophilized formulation containing HYNIC-iPSMA, EDDA, tricine, mannitol and stannous chloride. The radiochemical purity was evaluated by reversed-phase HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Stability studies in human serum were performed by size-exclusion HPLC. In vitro cell uptake was tested using prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) with blocked and non-blocked receptors. Biodistribution and tumor uptake were determined in LNCaP tumor-bearing nude mice with blocked and non-blocked receptors, and images were obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT. Whole-body images from three healthy men and two patients with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer (one of them with a previous 68Ga-PSMA-617scan) were acquired at 1h and 3h after 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA administration with radiochemical purities of >98%.  Results:   In vitro and in vivo studies showed high radiopharmaceutical stability in human serum, specific recognition for PSMA, high tumor uptake (10.22±2.96% ID/g at 1h) with rapid blood clearance and mainly kidney elimination.

The expression levels of the main marker molecules of these processes were measured by RT-PCR, Western blotting and zymography assays. GHRH increased both cell proliferation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) levels in LNCaP cells and in PC3 cells; however, such a rise was faster in the PC3 cells that represent the most aggressive stage of prostate cancer.

In addition, we assessed cell cycle, cell migration and VEGF secretion in PC3 cells. GHRH augmented the number of cells in G2/M-phase but diminished that corresponding to G1-phase. Cell-cycle specific markers were evaluated since GHRH effects may be related to their differential expression; we observed a decrease of p53, p21, and Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Furthermore, GHRH increased the expression of CD44, c-myc and cyclin D1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, and VEGF secretion.

The antitumor effects of immunocasp-3 were assessed in nude mice xenograft models containing PSMA-overexpressing LNCaP cells.  Results:   This study shows that the immunocasp-3 proteins selectively recognized and induced apoptotic death in PSMA-overexpressing LNCaP cells in vitro, where apoptotic cells were present in 15.3% of the cells transfected with the immunocasp-3 expression vector at 48 h after the transfection, in contrast to 5.5% in the control cells. Moreover, LNCaP cells were significantly killed under the condition of the co-culture of the immunocasp-3-secreting Jurkat cells and more than 50% of the LNCaP cells died when the two cell lines were co-cultured within 5 days. In addition, The expression of immunocasp-3 also significantly suppressed tumor growth and greatly prolonged the animal survival rate in vivo.  Conclusion:   A novel fusion gene, immunocasp-3, may represent a viable approach to treating PSMA-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Ping Meng', 'Qing-Chuan Dong', 'Guang-Guo Tan', 'Wei-Hong Wen', 'He Wang', 'Geng Zhang', 'Yan-Zhu Wang', 'Yu-Ming Jing', 'Chen Wang', 'Wei-Jun Qin', 'Jian-Lin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['PSMA specific single chain antibody-mediated targeted knockdown of Notch1 inhibits human prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.', 'Specific tumoricidal activity of a secreted proapoptotic protein consisting of HER2 antibody and constitutively active caspase-3.', 'Anti-tumor effects and lack of side effects in mice of an immunotoxin directed against human and mouse prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Updated application of prostate-specific membrane antigen to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Enhanced cytotoxicity of a Pseudomonas Exotoxin A based immunotoxin against prostate cancer by addition of the endosomal escape enhancer SO1861.', 'Targeted Toxins for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Engineered Fragments of the PSMA-Specific 5D3 Antibody and Their Functional Characterization.', 'Inclusion of a Furin Cleavage Site Enhances Antitumor Efficacy against Colorectal Cancer Cells of Ribotoxin α-Sarcin- or RNase T1-Based Immunotoxins.', 'Apoptosis and apoptotic body: disease message and therapeutic target potentials.']"""

However, the actual application for most existed PEC bioanalytical systems is still a challenge because the perfect solutions for sensing surface design, high-throughput detection, and portability are lacked. To successfully overcome these limitations and realize accurate, continuous screening and assessing on prognostic indicator of early stage cancer on the spot, an innovative and portable semiautomated support power-free photoelectrochemical (SP-PEC) immunosensing platform consisted with a miniature semiautomatic injection system and digital multimeter (DMM) readout is designed (prostate specific antigen, PSA, was used as the proof-of-concept analyte). Decahedral BiVO4 that decorated with Au nanocrystal on {010} facets (Au-BiVO4) by photodeposition is used as the photoanode materials to produce photocurrent signal under irradiation of micro laser light (5.0 w, λ ≥ 380 nm). The monoclonal anti-PSA capture antibody (mAb1)-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanobeads (mAb1-MN) and glucose oxidase (GOx)/monoclonal detection antibody (mAb2)-conjugated gold nanoparticle (GOx-AuNP-mAb2) are employed as immunosensing probe and signal probe, respectively. The H2O2 as an excellent holes scavenger that in suit generated from GOx oxidization glucose substrate significantly amplifies the photocurrent. The variation of instantaneous current value that registered as the signal of the immunoassay increases linearly with the logarithm of target PSA concentration increasing in a wide range from 10 pg mL-1 to 100 ng mL-1 with a low detection limit (LOD) of 4.0 pg mL-1. The SP-PEC immunosensing platform not only simplifies the assay process, but also improves detecting efficiency. The semiautomatic and portable SP-PEC analysis device allows analysis on spot and high-throughput continuous detection. Additional, we also gain deep insight into the relations between the specific shape as well as Au nanocrystal decoration and PEC activity and speculate the possible enhancement mechanisms of Au-BiVO4. Therefore, the present work not only develops a flexible SP-PEC biosensor platform for rapid and continuous detection, but also provides a possible route for designing high performance photoelectric materials.""","""['Jian Shu', 'Zhenli Qiu', 'Zhenzhen Lin', 'Guoneng Cai', 'Huanghao Yang', 'Dianping Tang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['A surface plasmon resonance enhanced photoelectrochemical immunoassay based on perovskite metal oxide@gold nanoparticle heterostructures.', 'A novel immunosensing platform for highly sensitive prostate specific antigen detection based on dual-quenching of photocurrent from CdSe sensitized TiO2 electrode by gold nanoparticles decorated polydopamine nanospheres.', 'Bio-bar-code-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen using rolling circle amplification and enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation.', 'Immunosensing procedures for carcinoembryonic antigen using graphene and nanocomposites.', 'Morphology-dependent electrochemical behavior of 18-facet Cu7S4 nanocrystals based electrochemical sensing platform for hydrogen peroxide and prostate specific antigen.', 'Smartphone-Based Photoelectrochemical Immunoassay with Co9S8@ZnIn2S4 for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Biomarker.', 'Selective and sensitive visible-light-prompt photoelectrochemical sensor of paracetamol based on Bi2WO6 modified with Bi and copper sulfide.', 'A colorimetric aptasensor for the antibiotics oxytetracycline and kanamycin based on the use of magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles.']"""

In this study, flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) was utilized to separate urinary exosomes by size, demonstrating a significant difference in exosome sizes between healthy controls and patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Exosome fractions of different sizes were collected for microscopic analysis during an FlFFF run and evaluated with exosome marker proteins using Western blot analysis. The results indicated that exosomes of different sizes originated from different types of cells. Collected exosome fractions were further examined using nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nUPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for lipidomic analysis. A total of 162 lipids (from 286 identified) were quantified using a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method. The overall amount of lipids increased by 1.5- to 2-fold in patients with PCa and degree of increase was more significant in the smaller fractions (diameter <150 nm) than in the larger ones (diameter >150 nm) some classes of lipids. In addition, neutral lipids like diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) decreased in all exosomes without size dependency. Moreover, a dramatic increase in 22:6/22:6-phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was observed and significant decrease in (16:0,16:0)- and (16:1, 18:1)-DAG species (nearly 5-fold) and high abundant TAG species (>2.5-fold) was observed in patients with PCa.

The algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy, and reproducibility under different initialization settings. Further it is investigated how a more robust estimation of tracer kinetics affects cancer diagnosis. The derived tracer kinetics from the Bayesian algorithm were validated against traditional NR algorithms (i.e. Levenberg-Marquardt, simplex) in terms of accuracy on a digital DCE phantom and in terms of goodness-of-fit (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) on ROI-based concentration time courses from two different patient cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 76 men, 20 of whom had significant peripheral zone prostate cancer (any cancer-core-length (CCL) with Gleason>3+3 or any-grade with CCL>=4mm) following transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy. The second cohort consisted of 9 healthy volunteers and 24 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnostic ability of the derived tracer kinetics was assessed with receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC AUC) analysis. The Bayesian algorithm accurately recovered the ground-truth tracer kinetics for the digital DCE phantom consistently improving the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) across the 50 different initializations compared to NR. For optimized initialization, Bayesian did not improve significantly the fitting accuracy on both patient cohorts, and it only significantly improved the ve ROC AUC on the HN population from ROC AUC=0.56 for the simplex to ROC AUC=0.76. For both cohorts, the values and the diagnostic ability of tracer kinetic parameters estimated with the Bayesian algorithm weren't affected by their initialization. To conclude, the Bayesian algorithm led to a more accurate and reproducible quantification of tracer kinetic parameters in DCE-MRI, improving their ROC-AUC and decreasing their dependence on initialization settings.""","""['Nikolaos Dikaios', 'David Atkinson', 'Chiara Tudisca', 'Pierpaolo Purpura', 'Martin Forster', 'Hashim Ahmed', 'Timothy Beale', 'Mark Emberton', 'Shonit Punwani']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Zone-specific logistic regression models improve classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MRI.', 'Robust estimation of hemo-dynamic parameters in traditional DCE-MRI models.', 'Direct parametric reconstruction from undersampled (k, t)-space data in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers in head and neck cancer: potential to guide treatment?

Methods and materials:   After the implantation of stranded seeds, using real-time intraoperative planning, a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-scan was obtained and contoured. The positions of seeds were determined on a C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-scan. The CBCT-scan was registered to the TRUS-scan using fiducial gold markers. If dose coverage on the combined image-dataset was inadequate, an intraoperative adaptation was performed by placing remedial seeds. CBCT-based intraoperative dosimetry was analyzed for the prostate (D90, V100, and V150) and the urethra (D30). The effects of the adaptive dosimetry procedure for Day 30 were separately assessed.  Results:   We analyzed 1266 patients. In 17.4% of the procedures, an adaptation was performed. Without the dose contribution of the adaptation Day 30 V100 would be < 95% for half of this group. On Day 0, the increase due to the adaptation was 11.8 ± 7.2% (1SD) for D90 and 9.0 ± 6.4% for V100. On Day 30, we observed an increase in D90 of 12.3 ± 6.0% and in V100 of 4.2 ± 4.3%. For the total group, a D90 of 119.6 ± 9.1% and V100 of 97.7 ± 2.5% was achieved. Most remedial seeds were placed anteriorly near the base of the prostate.

The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.""","""['Jianneng Li', 'Mohammad Alyamani', 'Ao Zhang', 'Kai-Hsiung Chang', 'Michael Berk', 'Zhenfei Li', 'Ziqi Zhu', 'Marianne Petro', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Jorge A Garcia', 'Kevin Courtney', 'Eric A Klein', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Elife""","""['Prostate cancer: Targeting metabolism.', 'Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase blockade reverses prostate cancer drug resistance in xenograft models by glucocorticoid inactivation.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor confers resistance to antiandrogens by bypassing androgen receptor blockade.', 'Enzalutamide response in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines reveals a role for glucocorticoid receptor in enzalutamide resistant disease.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid regulation of cancer development and progression.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A prospective study for comparison of two biopsy positions which were perform in a different working day was conducted for 208 men (lithotomy position=86, LLD=122). The decision on the position was made solely based on the patient's preference for the biopsy day, and all procedures were performed according to the identical protocol (12-core biopsy with intrarectal lidocaine gel), probe, and needle. The maximal degree of pain during the entire process was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), immediately after biopsy. After propensity matching, a total of 152 patients were finally selected (lithotomy group=76, LLD=76), then peri-biopsy parameters were compared.  Results:   Between groups, no differences were observed across all variables including age, obesity, prostate volume, serum PSA, international prostate symptom score, and cancer detection rate, except mean (±standard deviation) VAS score (3.89±2.01 vs. 4.58±2.22, p=0.049). VAS score showed significant association solely with patient's position (Pearson's coefficient=-0.165, p=0.042). In multiple linear regression models regarding the effect of clinical variables on VAS score, patient position was a single independent predictor favoring lithotomy position to decrease perceived pain (B=-0.928, p=0.024).

Long standing beliefs of androgen suppression conferring a protective effect against prostate cancer development have been challenged by the literature citing adenocarcinoma development in the prostate of rodent models following combined estrogen and testosterone treatment.  Materials and methods:   We herein present a MtFT patient who presented with high grade PCa following 20 years of exogenous estrogen therapy.

This has prompted us and others to search for improved biomarkers for CaP, to facilitate early detection and disease stratification. In this regard, autoantibodies (AAbs) against tumor antigens could serve as potential candidates for diagnosis and prognosis of CaP. Towards this, our goals were: i) To investigate whether AAbs against ERG oncoprotein (overexpressed in 25-50% of Caucasian American and African American CaP) are present in the sera of CaP patients; ii) To evaluate an AAb panel to enhance CaP detection. The results using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that anti-ERG AAbs are present in a significantly higher proportion in the sera of CaP patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, a panel of AAbs against ERG, AMACR and human endogenous retrovirus-K Gag successfully differentiated CaP patient sera from healthy controls (AUC = 0.791).

This study investigates intraoperative factors that potentially contribute to stranded source placement inaccuracy in prostate brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Intraoperative video images of the brachytherapist's hand motions and needle insertions during the implant procedure were acquired for analysis. Using video analysis software, maximum and average needle insertion velocities were determined. The number of needle insertion attempts and the use of the brachytherapist's other hand to manipulate the needle direction were also recorded. Sources misplacements were analyzed using an ultrasound-based method described elsewhere.  Results:   Fifteen patients agreed to undergo this study; 1619 125I seeds were inserted using 357 needles; 1197 seeds were confidently identified using ultrasound images and included in the analysis. The mean overall misplacement was 0.49 cm (0-2 cm, 95% CI = 0.47-0.51); 614 seeds were delivered with a single pass and 583 seeds with >1 passes (range 2-6). The mean maximum needle velocity was 12.34 cm s-1 (range 4-28 cm s-1) and mean average velocity was 4.76 cm s-1 (range 0.4-17.4 cm s-1); 747 seeds were delivered with manipulation of the needle. The generalized linear model test was used to analyze factors contributing to seed misplacement, and it was found that a maximum speed <12 cm s-1 was associated with a decrease in seed misplacement by 0.049 cm vs. a maximum speed >12 cm s-1, p = 0.0121). Other evaluated factors were found to have no statistically significant correlation with seed misplacement: average speed (p = 0.4947), manual manipulation of needle (p = 0.9264), and number of needle passes (p = 0.8907).  Conclusions:   This study identified that needles inserted with lower maximum velocity were associated with less seed misplacement.

Material and methods:   Patients undergoing RARP from 2008 to 2014 for a prostate cancer-related diagnosis were queried using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. The mFI was developed using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index as a model. The mFI was compared with other associative indices such as the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Rates of CDIV complications and 30-day mortality were analyzed based on mFI score using SAS version 9.22.  Results:   A total of 23,104 patients undergoing RARP were queried.

The hypothesis was that people with higher perceived neighborhood social cohesion would display increased use of preventive healthcare services.  Methods:   Participants (N=7,168) were drawn from the 2006 wave of the Health and Retirement Study-a prospective and nationally representative panel study of American adults aged >50 years-and tracked for one wave (2 years). Analyses were conducted in 2016.  Results:   After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and baseline health, each SD increase in neighborhood social cohesion was associated with a higher likelihood that people would obtain influenza vaccinations (OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.04, 1.15) or cholesterol tests (OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.02, 1.19). Further, women were more likely to receive mammograms/x-rays (OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.01, 1.19) or Pap tests (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.00, 1.17). However, men were not more likely to receive prostate exams (OR=1.06, 95% CI=0.96, 1.17).

Understanding of biological mechanisms mediated in response to chrysin in cancerous cells may provide novel insight into chemotherapeutic approaches with reduced side effects in cancers. In the present study, we investigated functional roles of chrysin in progression of prostate cancer cells using DU145 and PC-3 cell lines. The results showed that chrysin induced apoptosis of cells evidenced by DNA fragmentation and increasing the population of both DU145 and PC-3 cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, chrysin reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the prostate cancer cell lines compared to untreated prostate cancer cells. Moreover, chrysin induced loss of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), while increasing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner. Also, it induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) proteins including PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in DU145 and PC-3 cells. The chrysin-mediated intracellular signaling pathways suppressed phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the abundance of AKT, P70S6K, S6, and P90RSK proteins, but stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and activation of ERK1/2 and P38 proteins in the prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these results indicate that chrysin initiates cell death through induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and ER stress, and regulation of signaling pathways responsible for proliferation of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Soomin Ryu', 'Whasun Lim', 'Fuller W Bazer', 'Gwonhwa Song']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Chrysin leads to cell death in endometriosis by regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cytosolic calcium level.', 'Chrysophanol selectively represses breast cancer cell growth by inducing reactive oxygen species production and endoplasmic reticulum stress via AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathways.', 'Silibinin stimluates apoptosis by inducing generation of ROS and ER stress in human choriocarcinoma cells.', 'Molecular signal networks and regulating mechanisms of the unfolded protein response.', 'Bidirectional regulation of NF-κB by reactive oxygen species: a role of unfolded protein response.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Antitumor Effects of Microencapsulated Gratiola officinalis Extract on Breast Carcinoma and Human Cervical Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Anti-cancer Activity of Chrysin in Cancer Therapy: a Systematic Review.', 'LC-TOF-MS/MS and GC-MS based phytochemical profiling and evaluation of wound healing activity of Oroxylum Indicum (L.)

However, the clinical significance of ASPM in prostate cancer (PCa) has not yet been understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of ASPM with tumor progression and prognosis in PCa patients.  Methods:   The expression of ASPM at protein level in human PCa and non-cancerous prostate tissue was detected by immunohistochemical analysis, which was further validated by using microarray-based dataset (NCBI GEO: GSE21032 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset) at mRNA level. Subsequently, the association of ASPM expression with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PCa was then statistically analyzed.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry and dataset analyses revealed that ASPM expression was significantly increased in the PCa tissues with high Gleason score. Additionally, as showed by two datasets, ASPM expression was significantly high expressed in the PCa tissues when compared with the non-cancerous tissues, especially in advanced PCa pathological stage. The upregulation of ASPM mRNA expression in the PCa tissues significantly correlated with the presence of tumor metastasis, shorter overall survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure. Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the upregulation of ASPM was a potential predictor of poor biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival.

HEXIM1 protein level has been found to be downregulated by estrogens. Recently, HEXIM1 has been found to inhibit androgen receptor transcriptional activity as well. Researchers have used Hexamethylene bis-acetamide (HMBA) for decades to stimulate HEXIM1 expression, which also inhibit estrogen stimulated breast cancer cell gene activation and androgen stimulated prostate cancer gene activation. However, the direct molecular targets of HMBA that modulate the induction of HEXIM1 expression in mammalian cells have not been identified. Based on HMBA and its more potent analog 4a1, we designed molecular probes to pull down the binding proteins of these compounds. Via proteomic approach and biological assays, we demonstrate that HMBA and 4a1 are actually heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) binders.

Furthermore, both NRIP and DDB2 shared the same AR binding domain; they were competitors for the AR, but not for DDB1 binding, in the AR-DDB2-DDB1-CUL4A complex. Conclusively, NRIP stabilizes the AR protein by displacing DDB2 from the AR-DDB2 complex.

Itraconazole, a commonly used systemic antifungal drug, has been tested for its anti-tumor effects on basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Whether itraconazole has any specific anti-tumor effect on melanoma remains unknown. However, the goal of this study is to investigate the effect of itraconazole on melanoma and to reveal some details of its underlying mechanism. In the in vivo xenograft mouse model, we find that itraconazole can inhibit melanoma growth and extend the survival of melanoma xenograft mice, compared to non-itraconazole-treated mice. Also, itraconazole can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, as demonstrated by Ki-67 staining in itraconazole-treated tumor tissues. In in vitro, we show that itraconazole inhibits the proliferation and colony formation of both SK-MEL-28 and A375 human melanoma cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that itraconazole significantly down-regulates Gli-1, Gli-2, Wnt3A, β-catenin and cyclin D1, while it up-regulates Gli-3 and Axin-1, indicating potent inhibitory effects of itraconazole on Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways. Furthermore, itraconazole significantly suppresses the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway - indicated by the down-regulated phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and AKT - but has no effect on the phosphorylation of MEK or ERK. Our data suggest that itraconazole inhibits melanoma growth through an interacting regulatory network that includes Hh, Wnt, and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways.

The stress oncoprotein lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGF/p75), also known as DFS70 autoantigen, promotes cellular survival against environmental stressors, including oxidative stress, radiation, and cytotoxic drugs. Furthermore, LEDGF/p75 overexpression in PCa and other cancers has been associated with features of tumor aggressiveness, including resistance to cell death and chemotherapy. We report here that the endogenous levels of LEDGF/p75 are upregulated in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cells selected for resistance to the taxane drug docetaxel (DTX). These cells also showed resistance to the taxanes cabazitaxel (CBZ) and paclitaxel (PTX), but not to the classical inducer of apoptosis TRAIL. Silencing LEDGF/p75 effectively sensitized taxane-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells to DTX and CBZ, as evidenced by a significant decrease in their clonogenic potential. While TRAIL induced apoptotic blebbing, caspase-3 processing, and apoptotic LEDGF/p75 cleavage, which leads to its inactivation, in both taxane-resistant and -sensitive PC3 and DU145 cells, treatment with DTX and CBZ failed to robustly induce these signature apoptotic events. These observations suggested that taxanes induce both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in mCRPC cells, and that maintaining the structural integrity of LEDGF/p75 is critical for its role in promoting taxane-resistance.

Results:   PlncRNA-1 and TGF-β1 expression levels were significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues than in normal prostate tissues (P < 0.05) and were significantly positively correlated. TGF-β1, N-cadherin and Cyclin-D1 were downregulated and E-Cadherin was upregulated in LNCAP cells after silencing of PlncRNA-1, as determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. TGF-β1, N-cadherin and Cyclin-D1 were upregulated and E-cadherin was downregulated in C4-2 cells, as determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. Overexpression of PlncRNA-1 in C4-2 cells was observed when TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761 was added. Western blot analysis showed that compared with their expression when TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761 was not added, N-Cadherin and CyclinD1 expression decreased and E-Cadherin expression increased. Transwell results showed that the invasive ability of C4-2 cells was enhanced after overexpression of PlncRNA-1, and the invasion ability was decreased after addition of TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761. The cell cycle was blocked by overexpression of PlncRNA-1 in C4-2 and by the addition of TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761, as determined by flow cytometry. In vitro experiments showed that PlncRNA-1 can regulate the growth of prostate cancer cells and EMT through the TGF-β1 pathway. In vivo experiments also confirmed the above results. Tumor growth was significantly blocked by overexpressing PlncRNA-1 in C4-2 cells and by the TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761 in animal experiments.  Materials and methods:   The expression levels of PlncRNA-1 and TGF-β1 were analyzed in 19 prostate cancer tissue samples and in adjacent normal tissue samples, 4 Pca cell lines, including LNCaP, C4-2,DU145, and PC3, and 1 normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. LNCAP cells were divided into the LNCAP control group and the LNCAP-PlncRNA-1-siRNA group. Cells from the prostate cancer cell line C4-2 were divided into the C4-2 control group and the C4-2-PlncRNA-1 experimental group. Changes in TGF-β1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin were detected by qPCR and Western Blot assay after silencing and overexpression of PlncRNA-1. The cell cycle, cell invasion, and levels of Cyclin-D1, E-Cadherin, and N-Cadherin were observed after adding TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761 in the C4-2-PlncRNA-1 group. The effects of TGF-β1 inhibitor LY2109761 on the tumorigenicity of C4-2 cells after overexpression of PlncRNA-1 was investigated in vivo.

Simulation results demonstrate that interstitial fluid pressure and interstitial fluid loss vary non-linearly with tumour size. Transvascular drug exchange, driven by the concentration gradient of unbound drug between blood and interstitial fluid, is more efficient in small tumours, owing to the low spatial-mean interstitial fluid pressure and dense microvasculature.

Due to low power for single-variant testing, aggregative methods are commonly used to combine observed rare variation within a single gene. Causal variation may also aggregate across multiple genes within relevant biomolecular pathways. Kernel-machine regression and adaptive testing methods for aggregative rare-variant association testing have been demonstrated to be powerful approaches for pathway-level analysis, although these methods tend to be computationally intensive at high-variant dimensionality and require access to complete data. An additional analytical issue in scans of large pathway definition sets is multiple testing correction. Gene set definitions may exhibit substantial genic overlap, and the impact of the resultant correlation in test statistics on Type I error rate control for large agnostic gene set scans has not been fully explored. Herein, we first outline a statistical strategy for aggregative rare-variant analysis using component gene-level linear kernel score test summary statistics as well as derive simple estimators of the effective number of tests for family-wise error rate control.

Several studies have previously reported that chronic exposure to CLD leads to hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, raises early child development and pregnancy complications, and increases the risk of liver and prostate cancer. In situ chemical reduction (ISCR) has been identified as a possible way for the remediation of soils contaminated by CLD. In the present study, the objectives were (i) to evaluate the genotoxicity and the mutagenicity of two CLD metabolites formed by ISCR, CLD-5a-hydro, or CLD-5-hydro (5a- or 5- according to CAS nomenclature; CLD-1Cl) and tri-hydroCLD (CLD-3Cl), and (ii) to explore the angiogenic properties of these molecules. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were investigated using the Ames's technique on Salmonella typhimurium and the in vitro micronucleus micromethod with TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells. The proangiogenic properties were evaluated on the in vitro capillary network formation of human primary endothelial cells. Like CLD, the dechlorinated derivatives of CLD studied were devoid of genotoxic and mutagenic activity. In the assay targeting angiogenic properties, significantly lower microvessel lengths formed by endothelial cells were observed for the CLD-3Cl-treated cells compared to the CLD-treated cells for two of the three tested concentrations. These results suggest that dechlorinated CLD derivatives are devoid of mutagenicity and genotoxicity and have lower proangiogenic properties than CLD.""","""['Samuel Legeay', 'Pierre-André Billat', 'Nicolas Clere', 'Fabrice Nesslany', 'Sébastien Bristeau', 'Sébastien Faure', 'Christophe Mouvet']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Environ Sci Pollut Res Int""","""['Microbial Transformation of Chlordecone and Two Transformation Products Formed During in situ Chemical Reduction.', 'In vivo comparison of the proangiogenic properties of chlordecone and three of its dechlorinated derivatives formed by in situ chemical reduction.', 'Comparative fate of an organochlorine, chlordecone, and a related compound, chlordecone-5b-hydro, in soils and plants.', 'Mutagens in surface waters: a review.', 'Mutagens in contaminated soil: a review.', 'Functionalized gold nanoparticles for sensing of pesticides: A review.', 'Microbial Transformation of Chlordecone and Two Transformation Products Formed During in situ Chemical Reduction.', 'Evidence for extensive anaerobic dechlorination and transformation of the pesticide chlordecone (C10Cl10O) by indigenous microbes in microcosms from Guadeloupe soil.', 'Environmental and human health issues related to pesticides: from usage and environmental fate to impact.']"""

The objectives of this study were to determine who made the final decision to obtain prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening and identify factors associated with the screening decision made by both patients and their health care providers.  Methods:   Using the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from Delaware, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, we calculated weighted percentages of SDM. Associations between the SDM and sociodemographic, lifestyle, access to care, and PSA testing-related factors were assessed using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   There were 2,248 men aged 40 years or older who ever had a PSA-based screening in these three states. Only 36% of them made their prostate cancer screening decision jointly with their health care provider. Multivariate analyses showed that men who were married/living together or had a college degree and above were more likely to report having SDM than men who were never married or had less than high school education (P = 0.02 and 0.002). Moreover, men whose most recent PSA test occurred within the past year were more likely to report SDM than men who had the test done more than 2 years ago (P = 0.02).  Conclusions:   The majority of screening decisions were made by the patient or health care provider alone in these three states, not jointly, as recommended. Our study points to the need to promote SDM among patients and their health care providers before PSA testing.""","""['Jun Li', 'Ingrid J Hall', 'Guixiang Zhao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Impact of health literacy on shared decision making for prostate-specific antigen screening in the United States.', 'Pre-screening Discussions and Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing for Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Examination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in military and civilian men: analysis of the 2018 behavioral risk factor surveillance system.', 'Shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening and treatment: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Digital rectal examination and its associated factors in the early detection of prostate cancer: a cross-sectional population-based study.', 'The Influence of Decision Aids on Prostate Cancer Screening Preferences: A Randomized Survey Study.', 'Prostate cancer surveillance by occupation and industry: the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC).', 'Making the grade: The newest US Preventive Services Task Force prostate cancer screening recommendation.']"""

Mechanistically, we found that UCA1, one of the most important lncRNAs in malignancies of the urinary system, may be a potential mediator contributing to the tumor suppressor function of ART. First, the UCA1 level was reduced significantly after being exposed to ART. In addition, UCA1 was up-regulated in prostate cancer tissues compared to hyperplastic prostatic tissues, and a higher UCA1 level predicted poor prognosis in PCa patients. Furthermore, reintroduction of UCA1 into PCa cells reversed the effect of ART on apoptosis and metastatic ability.

Methods: One hundred eighteen patients with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 6.4 ng/mL (range, 2.2-158.4 ng/mL; interquartile range, 4.2-10.2 ng/mL) were finally eligible for this retrospective analysis. Seventy-seven and 41 patients had been treated by external-beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, respectively. Of the 118 patients, 45 were receiving androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) within at least 6 mo before the PET/CT. The detection rates were stratified by PSA. The influence of primary Gleason score and ADT was assessed. Relationships between SUV and clinical as well as pathologic features in patients with positive findings were analyzed using univariate and multivariable linear regression models. Results: One hundred seven of 118 patients (90.7%) showed pathologic findings indicative for tumor recurrence in 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT. The detection rates were 81.8% (36/44), 95.3% (41/43), and 96.8% (30/31) for PSA of 2 to <5, 5 to <10, and ≥10 ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.0377). 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT indicated local recurrence in 68 of 107 patients (63.5%), distant lesions in 64 of 107 patients (59.8%), and local recurrence as well as distant lesions in 25 of 107 patients (23.4%). The detection rate was significantly higher in patients with ADT (97.7%) versus without ADT (86.3%, P = 0.0381), but independent from primary Gleason score ≥ 8 (92.0%) versus ≤ 7 (90.2%, P = 0.6346). SUVmax and SUVmean were significantly associated with PSA and ADT (P = 0.018 and 0.004 for SUVmax, respectively; P = 0.025 and 0.007 for SUVmean, respectively). Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT demonstrates high detection rates in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy. The detection rate was positively associated to increasing PSA as well as concomitant ADT. 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT enables discrimination of local versus metastatic disease and thus might have a crucial impact on further clinical management.

It has been established that androgens induce cell-cycle progression, in part, through upregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression and subsequent activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). Thus, the efficacy of the newly described CDK4/6 inhibitors (G1T28 and G1T38), docetaxel and enzalutamide, was evaluated as single agents in clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo models of hormone-sensitive and treatment-resistant prostate cancer. CDK4/6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) was as effective as docetaxel in animal models of treatment-resistant CRPC but exhibited significantly less toxicity. The in vivo effects were durable and importantly were observed in prostate cancer cells expressing wild-type AR, AR mutants, and those that have lost AR expression. CDK4/6i was also effective in prostate tumor models expressing the AR-V7 variant or the AR F876L mutation, both of which are associated with treatment resistance. Furthermore, CDK4/6i was effective in prostate cancer models where AR expression was lost. It is concluded that CDK4/6 inhibitors are a viable alternative to taxanes as therapeutic interventions in endocrine therapy-refractory CRPC.Implications: The preclinical efficacy of CDK4/6 monotherapy observed here suggests the need for near-term clinical studies of these agents in advanced prostate cancer.

Here, we report prognostic relevance of EVI1 overexpression in triple-negative breast carcinoma but not in the HER2-positive breast carcinoma subset. In human breast cancer cells, EVI1 silencing reduced proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and tumorigenicity, effects rescued by estrogen supplementation in ER+ breast carcinoma cells. Estrogen addition restored ERK phosphorylation in EVI1-silenced cells, suggesting that EVI1 and estradiol signaling merge in MAPK activation. Conversely, EVI1 silencing had no effect on constitutive ERK activity in HER2+ breast carcinoma cells. Microarray analyses revealed G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) signaling as a prominent EVI1 effector mechanism in breast carcinoma. Among others, the GPR54-ligand KISS1 was identified as a direct transcriptional target of EVI1, which together with other EVI1-dependent cell motility factors such as RHOJ regulated breast carcinoma cell migration.

The proportions of men with minimally important differences (MIDs) in each domain were tested using repeated measures logistic models with prespecified thresholds.  Results:   The 3-year incidence of grade ≥1 (9.2% vs 2.0%; P=.028) and grade ≥2 (5.7% vs 0%; P=.012) rectal toxicity favored the spacer arm. Grade ≥1 urinary incontinence was also lower in the spacer arm (15% vs 4%; P=.046), with no difference in grade ≥2 urinary toxicity (7% vs 7%; P=0.7). From 6 months onward, bowel QOL consistently favored the spacer group (P=.002), with the difference at 3 years (5.8 points; P<.05) meeting the threshold for a MID. The control group had a 3.9-point greater decline in urinary QOL compared with the spacer group at 3 years (P<.05), but the difference did not meet the MID threshold. At 3 years, more men in the control group than in the spacer group had experienced a MID decline in bowel QOL (41% vs 14%; P=.002) and urinary QOL (30% vs 17%; P=.04). Furthermore, the control group were also more likely to have experienced large declines (twice the MID) in bowel QOL (21% vs 5%; P=.02) and urinary QOL (23% vs 8%; P=.02).  Conclusions:   The benefit of a hydrogel spacer in reducing the rectal dose, toxicity, and QOL declines after image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer was maintained or increased with a longer follow-up period, providing stronger evidence for the benefit of hydrogel spacer use in prostate radiation therapy.""","""['Daniel A Hamstra', 'Neil Mariados', 'John Sylvester', 'Dhiren Shah', 'Lawrence Karsh', 'Richard Hudes', 'David Beyer', 'Steven Kurtzman', 'Jeffrey Bogart', 'R Alex Hsi', 'Michael Kos', 'Rodney Ellis', 'Mark Logsdon', 'Shawn Zimberg', 'Kevin Forsythe', 'Hong Zhang', 'Edward Soffen', 'Patrick Francke', 'Constantine Mantz', 'Peter Rossi', 'Theodore DeWeese', 'Stephanie Daignault-Newton', 'Benjamin W Fischer-Valuck', 'Anupama Chundury', 'Hiram Gay', 'Walter Bosch', 'Jeff Michalski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'Long-Term Patient-Reported Outcomes From a Phase 3 Randomized Prospective Trial of Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Sexual quality of life following prostate intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a rectal/prostate spacer: Secondary analysis of a phase 3 trial.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'Same-day versus delayed simulation imaging after placement of a perirectal hydrogel spacer for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance guided SBRT reirradiation in locally recurrent prostate cancer: a multicentric retrospective analysis.', 'Quality Metric to Assess Adequacy of Hydrogel Rectal Spacer Placement for Prostate Radiation Therapy and Association of Metric Score With Rectal Toxicity Outcomes.', 'Treatment planning comparison of high-dose-rate brachytherapy vs. robotic and conventional stereotactic body radiotherapy for ultrahypofractionated treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Hyaluronic acid spacers for optimizing rectal dose in hypofractionated radiotherapy of the prostate.']"""

Recent studies show that metformin also targets Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a developmental pathway re-activated in several tumor types, including prostate cancer (PCa). Furthermore, we and others have shown that Hh signaling is an important target for radiosensitization. Here, we evaluated the combination of metformin and the Hh inhibitor GANT61 (GLI-ANTagonist 61) with or without ionizing radiation in three PCa cell lines (PC3, DU145, 22Rv1). The effect on proliferation, radiosensitivity, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species production, DNA repair, gene and protein expression was investigated. Furthermore, this treatment combination was also assessed in vivo. Metformin was shown to interact with Hh signaling by inhibiting the effector protein glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) in PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of metformin and GANT61 significantly inhibited PCa cell growth in vitro and enhanced the radiation response of 22Rv1 cells compared to either single agent. Nevertheless, neither the growth inhibitory effect nor the radiosensitization effect of the combination treatment observed in vitro was seen in vivo. Although the interaction between metformin and Hh signaling seems to be promising from a therapeutic point of view in vitro, more research is needed when implementing this combination strategy in vivo.""","""['Annelies Gonnissen', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Chad M McKee', 'Ruth J Muschel', 'Karin Haustermans']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['The hedgehog inhibitor GANT61 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation both in vitro and in vivo.', 'Anti-cell growth and anti-cancer stem cell activities of the non-canonical hedgehog inhibitor GANT61 in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Widespread Expression of Hedgehog Pathway Components in a Large Panel of Human Tumor Cells and Inhibition of Tumor Growth by GANT61: Implications for Cancer Therapy.', 'Concomitant targeting of Hedgehog signaling and MCL-1 synergistically induces cell death in Hedgehog-driven cancer cells.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'Metformin Intervention-A Panacea for Cancer Treatment?', 'Integrated or Independent Actions of Metformin in Target Tissues Underlying Its Current Use and New Possible Applications in the Endocrine and Metabolic Disorder Area.', 'Combined metformin-salicylate treatment provides improved anti-tumor activity and enhanced radiotherapy response in prostate cancer; drug synergy at clinically relevant doses.', 'Fatty Acids Metabolism: The Bridge Between Ferroptosis and Ionizing Radiation.']"""

The impact of baseline NLR and change after eight weeks of treatment on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier-estimates and Cox-regression. 79 men with baseline NLR <5 and 17 with NLR >5 were analyzed. In baseline analysis of PFS NLR >5 was associated with non-significantly shorter median PFS (five versus 10 months) (HR: 1.6 (95%CI:0.9-2.8); p = 0.11). After multivariate adjustment (MVA), ECOG > 0-1, baseline LDH>upper limit of normal (UNL) and presence of visceral metastases were independent prognosticators. For OS, NLR >5 was associated with shorter survival (seven versus 19 months) (HR: 2.3 (95%CI:1.3-4.0); p < 0.01). In MVA, ECOG > 0-1 and baseline LDH > UNL remained independent prognosticators. After 8 weeks of Abiraterone NLR-change to <5 prognosticated worse PFS (five versus 12 months) (HR: 4.1 (95%CI:1.1-15.8); p = 0.04). MVA showed a trend towards worse PFS for NLR-change to <5 (p = 0.11). NLR-change to <5 led to non-significant shorter median OS (seven versus 16 months) (HR: 2.3 (95%CI:0.7-7.1); p = 0.15).

Clinical studies demonstrate higher expression of NF-κB/p65/RelA, NF-κB/p50/RelB, and cRel as well as downregulation of the p53 network in primary prostate cancer specimens and in metastatic tumors. Betulinic acid (BA), is a triterpenoid that has been reported to be an effective inducer of apoptosis through modification of several signaling pathways. Our objective was to investigate the pathways involved in BA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. We employed the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells harboring wild-type p53, and androgen-refractory DU145 cells possessing mutated p53 with high constitutive NF-κB activity. Inhibition of cell survival by BA at 10 and 20 µM concentrations occurred as a result of alteration in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in both cell lines that led to an increased cytochrome C release, caspase activation and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to apoptosis. BA treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 through increase in phosphorylation at Ser15 in LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells, and induction of cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Waf1 in both cell types. Furthermore, treatment of both prostate cancer cells with BA decreased the phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK)α and I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) inhibiting the nuclear location of NF-κB/p65 causing cytosolic accumulation and resulting in its decreased nuclear binding. We demonstrate that BA may induce apoptosis by stabilizing p53 and downregulating NF-κB pathway in human prostate cancer cells, irrespective of the androgen association, and therefore can potentially be developed as a molecule of interest in cancer chemoprevention.""","""['Eswar Shankar', 'Ailin Zhang', 'Daniel Franco', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Betulinic acid suppresses constitutive and TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by betulinic acid-rich fraction from Dillenia suffruticosa root in MCF-7 cells involved p53/p21 and mitochondrial signalling pathway.', 'NF-kappaB activation enhances cell death by antimitotic drugs in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Multiple molecular targets in breast cancer therapy by betulinic acid.', 'Betulinic acid, a natural compound with potent anticancer effects.', 'Novel triphenylphosphonium amphiphilic conjugates of glycerolipid type: synthesis, cytotoxic and antibacterial activity, and targeted cancer cell delivery.', 'Evaluation of Apoptosis, Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Progression by Inactivation of the NEAT1 Long Noncoding RNA in a Renal Carcinoma Cell Line Using CRISPR/Cas9.', 'SESN2 Knockdown Increases Betulinic Acid-Induced Radiosensitivity of Hypoxic Breast Cancer Cells.', 'The Chemo-Sensitizing Effect of Doxorubicin of Apple Extract-Enriched Triterpenic Complex on Human Colon Adenocarcinoma and Human Glioblastoma Cell Lines.', 'Pharmaco-Toxicological Assessment of the Combined Cytotoxic Effects of Digoxin and Betulinic Acid in Melanoma Cells.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Patient-reported information and medical records were prospectively collected as part of the North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effectiveness & Survivorship Study, a population-based cohort of 881 patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer enrolled in the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013. The presence or absence of 20 medical conditions was compared based on patient report vs abstraction of medical records.  Main outcomes and measures:   Agreement between patient reports and medical records for each condition was assessed using the κ statistic. Subgroup analyses examined differences in κ statistics based on age, race, marital status, educational level, and income. Logistic regression models for each condition examined factors associated with higher agreement.  Results:   A total of 881 patients participated in the study (median age, 65 years; age range, 41-80 years; 633 white [71.9%]). In 16 of 20 conditions, there was agreement between patient reports and medical records for more than 90% of patients; agreement was lowest for hyperlipidemia (68%; κ = 0.36) and arthritis (66%; κ = 0.14).

Adherence was highest at baseline and declined over time (visit 1, 100%; visit 2, 96%; visit 3, 95%; visit 4, 91%; and visit 5, 85%). Reasons for missing PROs included institutional errors in 27 of 48 (56.3%) of the cases (eg, staff forgetting to bring computers to patients at visits), patients feeling ""too ill"" in 8 (16.7%), patient refusal in 8 (16.7%), and internet connectivity problems in 5 (10.4%). Patient-investigator CTCAE agreement was moderate or worse for most symptoms (most κ < 0.05), with investigators reporting fewer AEs than patients across symptoms. Most patients believed that the system was easy to use (234 [93.2%]) and useful (230 [93.1%]), and investigators thought that the patient-reported AEs were useful (133 [94.3%]) and accurate (119 [83.2%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Participants in multicenter cancer trials are willing and able to report their own symptomatic AEs at most clinic visits and report more AEs than investigators.

Patients and methods:   Development of the model was based on a prospective cohort including 393 men who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before biopsy. External validity of the model was then examined retrospectively in 198 men from a separate institution whom underwent mpMRI followed by biopsy for abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or digital rectal examination (DRE). A model was developed with age, PSA level, DRE, prostate volume, previous biopsy, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score, as predictors for significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 with >5% grade 4, ≥20% cores positive or ≥7 mm of cancer in any core). Probability was studied via logistic regression. Discriminatory performance was quantified by concordance statistics and internally validated with bootstrap resampling.  Results:   In all, 393 men had complete data and 149 (37.9%) had significant prostate cancer. While the variable model had good accuracy in predicting significant prostate cancer, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, the advanced model (incorporating mpMRI) had a significantly higher AUC of 0.88 (P < 0.001). The model was well calibrated in internal and external validation. Decision analysis showed that use of the advanced model in practice would improve biopsy outcome predictions. Clinical application of the model would reduce 28% of biopsies, whilst missing 2.6% significant prostate cancer.

In Norway, the required waiting period has been 1 year.  Methods:   We compared patient and graft survival of recipients with pretransplant cancer to the outcomes of matched recipients without such cancer (comparators) using Cox regression.  Results:   From 1963 to 2010, 377 (6.4%) of 5867 recipients had a pretransplant cancer. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 256 recipients died, 35 (13.7%) from recurrent cancer and 27 (10.5%) from de novo cancer. Uncensored and death-censored graft loss occurred in 263 and 46 recipients, respectively. All-cause mortality was similar as in comparators (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.20]; P = 0.40), death-censored graft loss was lower (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.84; P = 0.002), and uncensored graft loss was similar (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.12; P = 0.87).

Even if a sufficient number of pathological training samples are collected, statistical shape modeling cannot always capture shape features of pathological samples as they may be suppressed by shape features of a considerably larger number of healthy samples. At the same time, landmarking can be efficient in analyzing pathological structures but often lacks robustness. In this paper, we combine the advantages of landmark detection and deformable models into a novel supervised multi-energy segmentation framework that can efficiently segment structures with pathological shape. The framework adopts the theory of Laplacian shape editing, that was introduced in the field of computer graphics, so that the limitations of statistical shape modeling are avoided. The performance of the proposed framework was validated by segmenting fractured lumbar vertebrae from 3-D computed tomography images, atrophic corpora callosa from 2-D magnetic resonance (MR) cross-sections and cancerous prostates from 3D MR images, resulting respectively in a Dice coefficient of 84.7 ± 5.0%, 85.3 ± 4.8% and 78.3 ± 5.1%, and boundary distance of 1.14 ± 0.49mm, 1.42 ± 0.45mm and 2.27 ± 0.52mm.

Methods:   Using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, men age 40 or older with prostate cancer on continuous ADT for at least 6 months or who underwent bilateral orchiectomy (n = 38,931) were matched 1:1 with men with prostate cancer who had never received ADT. Treated and untreated groups were range-matched on age at index date and year of diagnosis, and propensity-matched on comorbidities, medications, cardiovascular risk factors, and socio-economic variables. A competing risk analysis was conducted where the primary outcome was time to a new diagnosis of parkinsonism.  Results:   The cohort was followed for a mean of 5.76 years. Based on the results from the multivariable cause-specific hazard regression model, the adjusted relative rate of experiencing parkinsonism among ADT users compared to non-users was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.83, p < 0.0001). The adjusted relative rate of experiencing the competing event of death among ADT users compared to non-users was 1.33 (95% CI 1.30-1.36, p < 0.0001).

We demonstrate that, in the context of prostate cancer, LO harbor sustained AKT1 kinase activity, nominating them as active signaling platforms. Active AKT1 was detected in circulating EV from the plasma of metastatic prostate cancer patients and was LO specific. LO internalization induced reprogramming of human normal prostate fibroblasts as reflected by high levels of α-SMA, IL6, and MMP9. In turn, LO-reprogrammed normal prostate fibroblasts stimulated endothelial tube formation in vitro and promoted tumor growth in mice. Activation of stromal MYC was critical for this reprogramming and for the sustained cellular responses elicited by LO, both in vitro and in vivo in an AKT1-dependent manner. Inhibition of LO internalization prevented activation of MYC and impaired the tumor-supporting properties of fibroblasts. Overall, our data show that prostate cancer-derived LO powerfully promote establishment of a tumor-supportive environment by inducing a novel reprogramming of the stroma. This mechanism offers potential alternative options for patient treatment.

However, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and symptom severity in people with advanced cancer is unknown. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a community-based walking intervention to enhance QoL in people with recurrent/metastatic cancer.  Design:   We used a mixed-methods design comprising a 2-centre RCT and nested qualitative interviews.  Participants:   Patients with advanced breast, prostate, gynaecological or haematological cancers randomised 1:1 between intervention and usual care.  Intervention:   The intervention comprised Macmillan's 'Move More' information, a short motivational interview with a recommendation to walk for at least 30 min on alternate days and attend a volunteer-led group walk weekly.  Outcomes:   We assessed feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and RCT by evaluating study processes (rates of recruitment, consent, retention, adherence and adverse events), and using end-of-study questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing QoL, activity, fatigue, mood and self-efficacy were completed at baseline and 6, 12 and 24 weeks.  Results:   We recruited 42 (38%) eligible participants. Recruitment was lower than anticipated (goal n=60), the most commonly reported reason being unable to commit to walking groups (n=19). Randomisation procedures worked well with groups evenly matched for age, sex and activity. By week 24, there was a 45% attrition rate. Most PROMs while acceptable were not sensitive to change and did not capture key benefits.  Conclusions:   The intervention was acceptable, well tolerated and the study design was judged acceptable and feasible. Results are encouraging and demonstrate that exercise was popular and conveyed benefit to participants. Consequently, an effectiveness RCT is warranted, with some modifications to the intervention to include greater tailoring and more appropriate PROMs selected.

Methods:   574 men underwent definitive prostate EBRT to 70-78 Gy±androgen deprivation therapy between 2000 and 2009. The median follow-up from EBRT was 44 months. Patients were evaluated at baseline (pre-EBRT) and at intervals post-treatment using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) instrument.  Results:   Patients with mild IPSS at baseline (total 0-7) reported median total scores of 3, 4 and 3 at baseline, 6 and 48 months respectively post-EBRT. For patients with moderate IPSS at baseline (total 8-19), median total IPSS was 12 at baseline and 9 at both 6 and 48 months. For the severe IPSS group at baseline (total 20-35), the median total IPSS was 24, 12 and 14 at baseline, 6 and 48 months post-EBRT. The cumulative risk of persistent IPSS increase (greater than 5 points above baseline) at 48 months was 16%, 10% and 6% for patients with mild, moderate and severe baseline IPSS respectively. 94%, 54% and 11% of patients with mild, moderate and severe baseline IPSS reported good uQoL at baseline respectively, with these proportions increasing to 95%, 83% and 69% at 48 months.  Conclusion:   Urinary symptoms and uQoL as measured by the IPSS instrument remained stable or improved for the majority of men after definitive EBRT with or without ADT for prostate cancer. This was especially notable for the group of men with worse baseline symptoms or uQoL, with risk of persistent worsening of urinary symptoms decreasing with higher baseline IPSS category. Understanding the expected pattern of urinary symptoms and related uQoL in the months and years following EBRT taking into account baseline urinary function is highly valuable for counselling men as part of the therapeutic decision-making process.""","""['S Chin', 'A J Hayden', 'V Gebski', 'S Cross', 'S L Turner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Predictive factors for urinary toxicity after iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy with or without supplemental external beam radiotherapy.', 'External beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: urinary outcomes for men with high International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS).', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: analysis of short- and medium-term toxicity and quality of life.', 'A preliminary analysis of health-related quality of life in the first year after permanent source interstitial brachytherapy (PIB) for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Symptoms predicting health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with localized radiation therapy.']"""

Current diagnostic methods, including prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening, are unable to differentiate high-risk tumors from low-risk tumors, resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A peptide targeted contrast agent, ZD2-Gd(HP-DO3A), specific to an oncoprotein in tumor microenvironment, EDB-FN, was synthesized for noninvasive detection and characterization of aggressive prostate cancer. EDB-FN, one of the subtypes of oncofetal fibronectin, is involved in tumor epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is implicated in drug resistance and metastasis. The EDB-FN mRNA level in the metastatic PC3 cells was at least three times higher than that in non-metastatic LNCaP cells. In tumors, EDB-FN protein was highly expressed in PC3 tumor xenografts, but not in LNCaP tumors, as revealed by Western blot analysis. ZD2-Gd(HP-DO3A) produced over two times higher contrast-to-noise ratio in the PC3 tumors than in the LNCaP tumors in contrast-enhanced MRI during 30 min after injection. ZD2-Gd(HP-DO3A) possessed high chelate stability against transmetalation and minimal tissue accumulation. Our results demonstrate that molecular MRI of EDB-FN with ZD2-Gd(HP-DO3A) can potentially be used for noninvasive detection and risk stratification of human prostate cancer. Incorporation of this targeted contrast agent in the existing clinical contrast enhanced MRI procedures has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer.""","""['Zheng Han', 'Yajuan Li', 'Sarah Roelle', 'Zhuxian Zhou', 'Yuchi Liu', 'Rob Sabatelle', 'Aidan DeSanto', 'Xin Yu', 'Hui Zhu', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Zheng-Rong Lu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Magnetic resonance molecular imaging of metastatic breast cancer by targeting extradomain-B fibronectin in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Optimization of ZD2 Peptide Targeted Gd(HP-DO3A) for Detection and Risk-Stratification of Prostate Cancer with MRI.', 'Targeted Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging of Cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate: technical aspects and role in clinical management.', 'Clinical and imaging tools in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, a review.', 'RNA-Seq Analysis of Extradomain A and Extradomain B Fibronectin as Extracellular Matrix Markers for Cancer.', 'PET Imaging of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using ZD2-(68Ga-NOTA).', 'Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties, Pharmacokinetics, Biodistribution, Toxicity, and Contrast-Enhanced Cancer MRI of a Cancer-Targeting Contrast Agent, MT218.', 'Nano-Theranostics for the Sensing, Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancers.', 'Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging of Extradomain B Fibronectin Improves Imaging of Pancreatic Cancer Tumor Xenografts.']"""

A growing number of men experience these negative effects over a longer time because of the increased incidence of and prolonged survival in prostate cancer, and the ageing of the population. Only a few studies have investigated the adverse effects of different prostate cancer treatments using large population-based samples.  Methods:   We conducted a nationwide survey (n=1239) to collect detailed information regarding the negative effects (i.e., the occurrence, perceived level and perceived bother since the beginning of the treatment) of prostate cancer treatments: radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, hormone therapy and surveillance. Furthermore, we measured patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment and their psychological well-being (i.e., psychological symptoms and satisfaction with life) 5 years after diagnosis. The negative effects between the treatments were compared, and the determinants of satisfaction and psychological well-being were investigated.  Results:   The negative effects of all types of active prostate cancer treatments were common and persistent (33-48% reported symptoms at 5 years) and showed the known differences between the treatments. Prostatectomy and the radiotherapies caused urinary leakage; radiotherapy also caused symptoms of urinary irritation; and external radiation also caused bowel dysfunction. Most symptoms were considered highly bothersome. Most respondents (81-93%) reported that their treatment negatively affected their sex lives; 70-92% reported sexual dysfunction; and 20-58% reported that their sex lives with their spouses had ended. Urinary symptoms were especially associated with poorer psychological outcomes. The perception of symptom level and bother had a greater effect on patient satisfaction and well-being than the symptoms per se.  Conclusion:   Multiple and persistent negative effects follow active prostate cancer treatment, and these effects predict long-term patient satisfaction and psychological well-being. The harms and benefits associated with prostate cancer treatments should be considered when selecting whether and how to actively treat prostate cancer.""","""['Ulla-Sisko Lehto', 'Heli Tenhola', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Arpo Aromaa']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Long-term Psychological and Quality-of-life Effects of Active Surveillance and Watchful Waiting After Diagnosis of Low-risk Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Long-term quality-of-life outcomes after radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting: the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 randomised trial.', 'Quality of life and satisfaction with information after radical prostatectomy, radical external beam radiotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy: a long-term follow-up study.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Urinary continence recovery after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in relation to surgeon experience.', 'A Web-Based Cancer Self-Management Program (I-Can Manage) Targeting Treatment Toxicities and Health Behaviors: Human-Centered Co-design Approach and Cognitive Think-Aloud Usability Testing.', 'Excitation of a Single Compound by Light and Ultrasound Enhanced the Long-Term Cure of Mice Bearing Prostate Tumors.', 'Initial observations on sexual dysfunction as a symptom of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.', 'Living with prostate cancer: a mixed-method evaluation of group therapy intervention to alleviate psychological distress in a Canadian setting.']"""

The existing literature, which focuses on the elderly in fee-for-service settings, points to financial incentives as a driver of overuse and may not identify factors relevant to policy solutions within integrated health care systems, where physicians are salaried.  Methods:   Imaging rates were analyzed among men with incident prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 within the Colorado and Northwest regions of Kaiser Permanente. The sample was stratified according to indication for imaging, ie, high risk for whom imaging was necessary versus low risk for whom imaging was discouraged. Logistic regression was used to model the association between imaging receipt and clinical/demographic patient characteristics by risk strata.  Results:   Of the men with low-risk prostate cancer, 35% received nonindicated imaging at diagnosis, whereas 42% of men with high-risk prostate cancer did not receive indicated imaging. Compared with men diagnosed in 2004, those diagnosed in subsequent years were less likely to receive imaging across both risk groups. Men with high-risk cancer diagnosed at ≥ 65 years of age and those with clinical stage ≥ T2 were more likely to receive indicated imaging. Men with comorbidities were more likely to receive imaging across both risk groups. Men with low-risk prostate cancer who had higher median household incomes were less likely to receive nonindicated imaging.  Conclusion:   Nonindicated imaging for diagnostic staging of patients with low-risk prostate cancer was common, but has decreased over the past decade. These findings suggest that factors other than financial incentives may be driving overuse of imaging.""","""['Ramzi G Salloum', ""Maureen O'Keeffe-Rosetti"", 'Debra P Ritzwoller', 'Mark C Hornbrook', 'Jennifer Elston Lafata', 'Matthew E Nielsen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Determinants of the overuse of imaging in low-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Use of posttreatment imaging and biomarkers in survivors of early-stage breast cancer: Inappropriate surveillance or necessary care?', 'A clinician-centred programme for behaviour change in the optimal use of staging investigations for newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'The population level prevalence and correlates of appropriate and inappropriate imaging to stage incident prostate cancer in the medicare population.', 'Measuring integrated care.', 'Impact of choosing wisely on imaging in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Determinants of the overuse of imaging in low-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review.']"""

Methods:   Twenty patients with prostate cancer underwent Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT before prostatectomy. The PET protocol consisted of early dynamic pelvic imaging, followed by static scans at 60 and 180 minutes postinjection (p.i.). SUVs, time-activity curves, quantitative analysis based on a 2-tissue compartment model, Patlak analysis, histopathology, and Gleason grading were compared between prostate cancer and benign prostate gland.  Results:   Primary tumors were identified on both early dynamic and delayed imaging in 95% of patients. Tracer uptake was significantly higher in prostate cancer compared with benign prostate tissue at any time point (P ≤ 0.0003) and increased over time. Consequently, the tumor-to-nontumor ratio within the prostate gland improved over time (2.8 at 10 minutes vs 17.1 at 180 minutes p.i.). Tracer uptake at both 60 and 180 minutes p.i. was significantly higher in patients with higher Gleason scores (P < 0.01). The influx rate (Ki) was higher in prostate cancer than in reference prostate gland (0.055 [r = 0.998] vs 0.017 [r = 0.996]).  Conclusions:   Primary prostate cancer is readily identified on early dynamic and static delayed Ga-PSMA ligand PET images.

Ovarian tumour xenografts grown in non-obese diabetic/severe-combined-immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were treated with carboplatin or paclitaxel, or combination carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy regimens. After 4 weeks of treatment, tumours were extracted and underwent DW-MRI, mechanical testing, immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses. The distribution of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) exhibited an upward shift as a result of each treatment regimen. The 99-th percentile of the ADC distribution (""maximum ADC"") exhibited a strong correlation with the tumour size (r2 = 0.90) and with the inverse of the elastic modulus (r2 = 0.96). Single-agent paclitaxel (n = 5) and combination carboplatin/paclitaxel (n = 2) treatment regimens were more effective in inducing changes in regions of higher cell density than single-agent carboplatin (n = 3) or the no-treatment control (n = 5). The maximum ADC was a good indicator of treatment-induced cell death and changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Comparative analysis of the tumours' ADC distribution, mechanical properties and ECM constituents provides insights into the molecular and cellular response of the ovarian tumour xenografts to chemotherapy. Increased sample sizes are recommended for future studies.

Hence, this study aimed to quantify the effects of SSEs on health-care resource utilization (HRU), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and pain in men with CRPC metastasized to bone.  Methods:   This cohort study included men with CRPC and bone metastasis treated at a tertiary center during December 1996-July 2015. SSEs, including pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression and bone surgery, as well as HRU were identified retrospectively through medical records and clinical database. A subset of surviving patients completed Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaires. The incremental effect of SSEs on HRU was evaluated using multivariable generalized linear regression. Questionnaire scores were compared using effect sizes (ES); ES⩾0.33 indicated meaningful differences between SSE and non-SSE cohorts. Lower scores suggest lower HRQoL and pain.  Results:   Of the 832 patients, 207 developed ⩾1 SSE (mean 1.5±0.8) during follow-up (median 2.1 years). Radiation to bone was the most common SSE (84.1%). SSE cohort had significantly higher emergency room (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.48; P=0.006), outpatient (IRR=1.17; P=0.005) and inpatient (IRR=1.74; P<0.001) visits.

However, alternative oncogenic pathways that bypass AR signaling have emerged as an important mechanism promoting resistance to ADT. It is known that AR activation can prevent the interaction between β-catenin and T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) family, inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to determine the role of transcription factor 7 (TCF7), a transcription factor best known as a Wnt effector that forms a complex with β-catenin, in the development of advanced prostate cancer. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms by which TCF7 is induced when AR signaling is inactivated.  Methods:   A novel AR signaling pathway that induces microRNA-1 (miR-1) to suppress metastatic prostate cancer was recently demonstrated (AR-miR-1 signaling axis), and its regulation of Wnt signaling was explored in the current study. Clinical data sets were analyzed for potential targets of AR-miR-1 signaling in the TCF/LEF family, and tissue samples were utilized to validate the relationship. The molecular mechanism and biological functions were demonstrated in prostate cancer cell lines and a mouse xenograft model.  Results:   We demonstrated a molecular mechanism of AR signaling suppressing TCF7 partly through miR-1-mediated downregulation. TCF7 exhibited oncogenic properties and compromised the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-1. Our results also showed that overexpression of TCF7 or disruption of miR-1 function promoted androgen-independent proliferation.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that the AR-miR-1 axis negatively regulates the novel oncogenic factor, TCF7. Dysregulation of TCF7 promoted a survival advantage and resistance to androgen deprivation, suggesting its therapeutic potential for castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['M K Siu', 'W-Y Chen', 'H-Y Tsai', 'H-Y Chen', 'J J Yin', 'C-L Chen', 'Y-C Tsai', 'Y-N Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Comprehensive proteomic profiling identifies the androgen receptor axis and other signaling pathways as targets of microRNAs suppressed in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Loss of Androgen-Regulated MicroRNA 1 Activates SRC and Promotes Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Androgen-induced miR-135a acts as a tumor suppressor through downregulating RBAK and MMP11, and mediates resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', ""Sex-specific transcriptional rewiring in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients."", 'TCF7/SNAI2/miR-4306 feedback loop promotes hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'TCF7L1 regulates cytokine response and neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of Anti-Tumor Effects of an MLK1 Inhibitor in Prostate and Pancreatic Cancers.']"""

BCRs were managed using salvage radiation therapy (SRT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or active surveillance (AS). BCR-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Factors predicting earlier or later BCR and BCR after SRT were assessed using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively.  Results:   The probabilities of developing BCR within 5 years and 10 years were 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-13.9) and 18.4% (95% CI 16.2-20.6), respectively. On multivariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen doubling time, positive surgical margins and pathological Gleason score significantly differentiated earlier from later BCR. Overall, 74.5, 12.7 and 12.7% of men developing BCR underwent SRT, ADT or AS, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of men in the earlier BCR group underwent SRT (80.8 vs 59%) and ADT (14.6 vs 8.2%), and a significantly greater proportion of men in the later BCR group underwent AS (32.8 vs 4.6%; P<0.001). The response to SRT was independent of time to BCR. On multivariate analysis, clinical stage and pathological stage significantly predicted failure of SRT.  Conclusions:   Approximately one third of BCRs occurred between 5 and 10 years after RP.

Results:   Of the 62 patients, 19 (30.6%) did not have clinical progression during follow-up, two (3.2%) had local recurrence, and 32 (51.6%) had haematogenous and nine (14.5%) combined pelvic and distant metastasis. Forty patients (64.5%) died, 34 (54.8%) from PCa and six (9.7%) from other causes. The median (range) survival time of the 19 patients who were metastasis-free at last follow-up was 86 (1-314) months, 8/19 patients had a follow-up of >5 years, and five patients survived metastasis-free for >15 years. Patients without seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) had the best outcomes, with an estimated 10-year PCa-specific survival of 75% compared with 24% for patients with SVI.  Conclusion:   For cT4 PCa RC can be an appropriate treatment for local control and part of a multimodality-treatment approach. Although recurrences are probable, these do not necessarily translate into cancer-specific death. Men without SVI had a 75% 10-year PCa-specific survival.

Methods:   Semi-structured in-depth interviews with ten HCPs (Consultant Urological Surgeons, Uro-Oncology Clinical Nurse Specialists and Allied Health Professionals: see Table 1) and sixteen men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer and seven of their partners. Data from interviews were thematically analysed using the Framework Approach.  Results:   The men and their partners provided differing accounts to the HCPs and sometimes to each other concerning the provision of advice on diet and physical activity. Some men were unable to recall receiving such advice from HCPs. Factors impacting upon advice-giving included the perceived lack of an evidence base to support dietary and physical activity advice and the credibility of advice providers. The timing of advice provision was a contentious issue as some HCPs believed that patients might not be willing to receive dietary and physical activity advice at the time of diagnosis, whilst others viewed this an opportune time to provide behaviour change information. Patients concurred with the latter opinion.  Conclusions:   Men and their partners would value nutritional and physical activity advice from their HCP, after a localised prostate cancer diagnosis. Men would prefer to receive this advice at an early stage in their cancer journey and may implement behaviour change if the received advice is clear and evidence-based.

The assay was linear over the ranges of 1-1000ng/mL for abiraterone and bicalutamide and 100-30,000ng/mL for N-desmethyl enzalutamide and enzalutamide and proved to be accurate (92.8-107.7%) and precise (largest was 15.3% CV at LLOQ for bicalutamide), and fulfilled FDA criteria for bioanalytical method validation. We demonstrated the suitability of this assay in plasma from patients who were administered enzalutamide 160mg, abiraterone 1000mg and bicalutamide 50mg once a day as monotherapy or in combination.

Objective:   We investigated the androgenic activity of various herbal medicines in human prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells.  Materials and methods:   Herbal extracts of Trichosanthes kirilowii (TK), Asarum sieboldii (AS), Sanguisorba officinalis (SO), and Xanthium strumarium (XS) were selected to have androgenic effects based on a preliminary in vitro screening system.  Results:   TK, AS, SO, and XS enhanced the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells without having cytotoxic effects. All tested herbal extracts increased androgen receptor (AR)-induced transcriptional activity in the absence or presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In an AR-binding assay, TK, but not AS, SO, or XS, produced a significant inhibition of AR binding activity, indicating it has androgenic activity. Additionally, TK treatment positively regulated mRNA expression of the AR-related molecular targets prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein 2 (KLK2) compared with untreated control.  Conclusion:   Taken together, TK-enhanced AR-mediated transcriptional activity might be an attractive candidate drug for treating androgen-related diseases.

Its deficiency is associated with gigantism and organismal lethality upon inflammatory challenge. However, mechanistic understanding of SOCS2 function is dismal due to our unawareness of its protein substrates. We performed a mass spectrometry based proteomic profiling upon SOCS2 depletion and yield quantitative data for ~4200 proteins. Through this screen we identify a novel target of SOCS2, the serine-threonine kinase NDR1. Over-expression of SOCS2 accelerates turnover, while its knockdown stabilizes, endogenous NDR1 protein. SOCS2 interacts with NDR1 and promotes its degradation through K48-linked ubiquitination. Functionally, over-expression of SOCS2 antagonizes NDR1-induced TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activity. Conversely, depletion of NDR1 rescues the effect of SOCS2-deficiency on TNFα-induced NF-κB transactivation. Using a SOCS2-/- mice model of colitis we show that SOCS2-deficiency is pro-inflammatory and negatively correlates with NDR1 and nuclear p65 levels. Lastly, we provide evidence to suggest that NDR1 acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an identified E3 ligase for NDR1. These results might explain how SOCS2-deficiency leads to hyper-activation of NF-κB and downstream pathological implications and posits that SOCS2 induced degradation of NDR1 may act as a switch in restricting TNFα-NF-κB pathway.""","""['Indranil Paul', 'Tanveer S Batth', 'Diego Iglesias-Gato', 'Amna Al-Araimi', 'Ibrahim Al-Haddabi', 'Amira Alkharusi', 'Gunnar Norstedt', 'Jesper V Olsen', 'Fahad Zadjali', 'Amilcar Flores-Morales']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['NDR1/STK38 potentiates NF-κB activation by its kinase activity.', 'TRIM13 regulates ubiquitination and turnover of NEMO to suppress TNF induced NF-κB activation.', 'NDR1 protein kinase promotes IL-17- and TNF-α-mediated inflammation by competitively binding TRAF3.', 'Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-kappaB activity.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'The Role of Mammalian STK38 in DNA Damage Response and Targeting for Radio-Sensitization.', 'USP15 Represses Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression by Regulation of Pathways of Cell Proliferation and Cell Migration: A System Biology Analysis.', 'USP2 Inhibits Lung Cancer Pathogenesis by Reducing ARID2 Protein Degradation via Ubiquitination.', '3D chromatin structure in chondrocytes identifies putative osteoarthritis risk genes.', 'USP15 in Cancer and Other Diseases: From Diverse Functionsto Therapeutic Targets.']"""

Since 223Ra is predominantly (95.3%) an alpha emitter with a 11.42days long half-life, the radiopharmaceutical, its remnants, the patient, and waste material can be managed and disposed with low radiation protection requirements. 227Ac is a long-lived (T1/2=21.77years) beta emitter that demands strong radiation protection measures. In particular waste disposal has to follow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and European Commission (EC) regulations. Since 227Ac is involved in the production of 223Ra, an impurity analysis of each batch is required after production. Due to time restrictions, the manufacturer's detection limit (<0.001%) exceeds the one required to assure that 227Ac concentrations are below direct disposal levels. To improve the detection limit, long-term accurate spectroscopy is required. Alpha and gamma spectroscopy measurements were carried out at the Complutense University Nuclear Physics Laboratory. After twelve months follow up of a sample, 227Ac concentration was found to be smaller than 10-9. This allows for direct waste disposal and no additional radiation protection restrictions than those required for 223Ra. The presence of contamination by other radioisotopes was also ruled out by this experiment.

Conclusions:   Despite the relatively poor prognosis of patients with high risk prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy results in favorable 5 and 8-year metastatic progression-free survival, prostate cancer specific mortality-free survival and overall survival rates. Relative to high risk cases, their very high risk counterparts have significantly worse pathological and oncologic outcomes, and more frequently require additional therapies.

Overall complication rates were 25.1% for RPP, 36.4% for RRP, 16.1% for LRP, and 9.4% for RARP (P < .001), respectively. After RPP, wound dehiscence (10.3%) was the most common complication. However, approximately 75% of complications were minor.  Conclusion:   RPP showed acceptable oncologic outcomes compared with other surgical approaches.

We aimed to develop and validate a model to identify high-risk prostate cancer (with a Gleason score of at least 7) with better test characteristics than that provided by PSA screening alone.  Methods:   The Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study is a prospective, population-based, paired, screen-positive, diagnostic study of men without prostate cancer aged 50 to 69 years randomly invited by date of birth from the Swedish Population Register kept by the Swedish Tax Agency. Men with prostate cancer at enrolment were excluded from the study. The predefined STHLM3 model (a combination of plasma protein biomarkers [PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, hK2, MSMB, MIC1], genetic polymorphisms [232 SNPs], and clinical variables [age, family, history, previous prostate biopsy, prostate exam]), and PSA concentration were both tested in all participants enrolled. The primary aim was to increase the specificity compared with PSA without decreasing the sensitivity to diagnose high-risk prostate cancer. The primary outcomes were number of detected high-risk cancers (sensitivity) and the number of performed prostate biopsies (specificity). The STHLM3 training cohort was used to train the STHLM3 model, which was prospectively tested in the STHLM3 validation cohort. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between biomarkers and clinical variables and prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7. This study is registered with ISCRTN.com, number ISRCTN84445406.  Findings:   The STHLM3 model performed significantly better than PSA alone for detection of cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (P<0.0001), the area under the curve was 0·56 (95% CI: 0·55-0·60) with PSA alone and 0·74 (95% CI: 0·72-0·75) with the STHLM3 model. All variables used in the STHLM3 model were significantly associated with prostate cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (P<0·05) in a multiple logistic regression model. At the same level of sensitivity as the PSA test using a cutoff of≥3ng/ml to diagnose high-risk prostate cancer, use of the STHLM3 model could reduce the number of biopsies by 32% (95% CI: 24-39) and could avoid 44% (35-54) of benign biopsies.  Interpretation:   The STHLM3 model could reduce unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to diagnose prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7, and could be a step towards personalised risk-based prostate cancer diagnostic programmes.

Methods:   Forty-three patients were randomized 1:1 to receive up to 10 cycles of docetaxel alone, 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or in combination with DCvac. Monocytes were harvested following a leukapheresis procedure, matured ex vivo and subsequently transfected with messenger RNA encoding multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAAs).

Senescence is terminal growth arrest in response to cell stress that is characterized by increased lysosomal-β-galactosidase (GLB1) the origin of senescence associated-β-gal activity (SA-β-gal). In the current study senescence is examined in vivo after ADT use in a neoadjuvant trial.  Methods and materials:   Tissue microarrays were generated from prostate cancer specimens (n = 126) from a multicenter neoadjuvant ADT trial. Arrays were subjected to multiplexed immunofluorescent staining for GLB1, Ki67, cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) and E-cadherin. Automated quantitative imaging was performed using Vectra™ and expression correlated with clinicopathologic features.  Results:   Tissue was analyzed from 59 patients treated with neoadjuvant ADT and 67 receiving no therapy preoperatively. Median follow-up was 85.3 mo and median ADT treatment was 5 mo. In PC treated with neoadjuvant ADT, GLB1 expression increased in intermediate Gleason score (GS 6-7; p = 0.001), but not high grade (GS 8-10) cancer. Significantly higher levels of GLB1 were seen in tissues undergoing neoadjuvant ADT longer than 5 months compared to untreated tissues (p = 0.002). In contrast, apoptosis significantly increased earlier (1-4 mo) after ADT treatment (p<0.5).  Conclusions:   Increased GLB1 after neoadjuvant ADT occurs primarily among more clinically favorable intermediate grade cancers and enrichment of the phenotype occurs in a temporally prolonged fashion. Senescence may explain the persistence of PCa cells after ADT. Given concerns for the detrimental longer term presence of senescent cells, targeting these cells for removal may improve outcomes.""","""['Michael L Blute Jr', 'Nathan Damaschke', 'Jennifer Wagner', 'Bing Yang', 'Martin Gleave', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Fangfang Shi', 'E Jason Abel', 'Tracy M Downs', 'Wei Huang', 'David F Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Overexpression of the novel senescence marker β-galactosidase (GLB1) in prostate cancer predicts reduced PSA recurrence.', 'Biological effect of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy assessed on specimens from radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Short term neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy does not affect prostate specific membrane antigen expression in prostate tissues.', 'Long-term outcomes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy combined with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy under an early salvage policy for patients with T3-T4N0M0 prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating neoadjuvant therapy effectiveness on systemic disease: use of a prostatic-specific membrane reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.', 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Cellular senescence in cancer: clinical detection and prognostic implications.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Senescence-Associated β-Galactosidase Detection in Pathology.', 'Patterns of indolence in prostate cancer (Review).']"""

We hypothesized that machine/statistical learning methods using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) would identify groups of patients of differing complication risk, and furthermore could be used to identify key biological sources of variability. We developed a novel learning algorithm, called pre-conditioned random forest regression (PRFR), to construct polygenic risk models using hundreds of SNPs, thereby capturing genomic features that confer small differential risk. Predictive models were trained and validated on a cohort of 368 prostate cancer patients for two post-radiotherapy clinical endpoints: late rectal bleeding and erectile dysfunction. The proposed method results in better predictive performance compared with existing computational methods. Gene ontology enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis are used to identify key biological processes and proteins that were plausible based on other published studies. In conclusion, we confirm that novel machine learning methods can produce large predictive models (hundreds of SNPs), yielding clinically useful risk stratification models, as well as identifying important underlying biological processes in the radiation damage and tissue repair process.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of PDGFR-β and its ligands (PDGF-B and PDGF-D) in a multicenter prostatectomy cohort of 535 Norwegian patients. Using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, the expression of ligands PDGF-B and PDGF-D and their corresponding receptor, PDGFR-β, was assessed in neoplastic tissue and tumor-associated stroma. PDGFR-β was expressed in benign and tumor associated stroma, but not in epithelium. High stromal expression of PDGFR-β was independently associated with clinical relapse (HR = 2.17, p = 0.010) and biochemical failure (HR = 1.58, p = 0.002). This large study highlights the prognostic importance of PDGFR-β expression, implicating its involvement in prostate cancer progression even in early stage disease.

Using a passive robotic manipulator, a lightweight and force sensitive wheeled probe is driven across the surface of tissue samples to collect continuous measurements of wheel-tissue dynamics. A color-coded map is then generated to visualize the stiffness distribution within the internal tissue structure. Having developed the RMI device in-house, we aim to compare the accuracy of this technique to commonly used methods of localizing prostate cancer in current practice: digital rectal exam (DRE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. Final histology is the gold standard used for comparison. A total of 126 sites from 21 robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens were examined. Analysis was performed for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive value across all patient risk profiles (defined by PSA, Gleason score and pathological score). Of all techniques, pre-operative biopsy had the highest sensitivity (76.2%) and accuracy (64.3%) in the localization of tumor in the final specimen. However, RMI had a higher sensitivity (44.4%) and accuracy (57.9%) than both DRE (38.1% and 52.4%, respectively) and MRI (33.3% and 57.9%, respectively). These findings suggest a role for RMI towards MIS, where haptic feedback is lacking.

We hypothesized that the use of vessel-sparing radiotherapy, analogous to the functional anatomy approach of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), would improve erectile function preservation while maintaining tumor control for men with localized prostate cancer.  Objective:   To determine erectile function rates after vessel-sparing radiotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in a phase 2 single-arm trial (NCT02958787) at a single academic center.  Intervention:   Patients received vessel-sparing radiotherapy utilizing a planning MRI and MRI-angiogram to delineate and avoid the erectile vasculature.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Both physician- and patient-reported inventories were used to capture erectile function at baseline and at 2 and 5 yr after treatment. Validated model-based comparisons were performed to compare vessel-sparing results to nerve-sparing RP and conventional radiotherapy.  Results and limitations:   From 2001 to 2009, 135 men underwent vessel-sparing radiotherapy. After a planned interim analysis, the trial was stopped after meeting the primary endpoint. The median follow-up was 8.7 yr, with a ≥94% response rate to all inventories at each time point. At 5 yr, 88% of patients were sexually active with or without the use of sexual aids. The 2-yr erectile function rates were significantly improved with vessel-sparing radiotherapy (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 71-85%) compared to modeled rates for convention radiotherapy (42%, 95% CI 38-45%; p<0.001) or nerve-sparing prostatectomy (24%, 95% CI 22-27%; p<0.001). At 2 yr after treatment, 87% of baseline-potent men retained erections suitable for intercourse. The 5- and 10-yr rates of biochemical relapse-free survival were 99.3% and 89.9%, and at 5 yr the biochemical failures were limited to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk group. The single-arm design is a limitation.  Conclusions:   Vessel-sparing radiotherapy appears to more effectively preserve erectile function when compared to historical series and model-predicted outcomes following nerve-sparing RP or conventional radiotherapy, with maintenance of tumor control. This approach warrants independent validation.  Patient summary:   In this interim analysis we looked at using a novel approach to spare critical erectile structures to preserve erectile function after prostate cancer radiotherapy. We found that almost 90% of patients at 5 yr after treatment remained sexually active, significantly higher than previous studies with surgery or radiotherapy.""","""['Daniel E Spratt', 'Jae Y Lee', 'Robert T Dess', 'Vrinda Narayana', 'Cheryl Evans', 'Adam Liss', 'Raymond Winfield', 'Matthew J Schipper', 'Theodore S Lawrence', 'Patrick W McLaughlin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Randomized phase II trial evaluation of erectile function after attempted unilateral cavernous nerve-sparing retropubic radical prostatectomy with versus without unilateral sural nerve grafting for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Erectile function after stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Vessel-sparing radiation and functional anatomy-based preservation for erectile function after prostate radiotherapy.', 'Survival and Complications Following Surgery and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Collaborative Review.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer radiotherapy and incidental testicular irradiation: Impact on gonadal function.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided vs Computed Tomography-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: The MIRAGE Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Daily online contouring and re-planning versus translation-only correction in neurovascular-sparing magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.']"""

This leads to a description from which risk-specific marginal hazard rates and survival functions are fully accessible, 'decontaminated' of the effects of informative censoring, and which includes Cox, random effects and latent class models as special cases.

This study was performed to assess associations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E2), with incident prostate, lung and colorectal cancer in community-dwelling older men. Plasma T, DHT and E2 were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry between 2001 and 2004 in 3690 men. Cancer outcomes until 20 June 2013 were ascertained using data linkage. Analyses were performed using proportional hazards competing-risks models, and adjustments were made for potential confounding factors including smoking status. Results are expressed as subhazard ratios (SHR). There were 348, 107 and 137 cases of prostate, lung and colorectal cancers respectively during a median of 9.1-year follow-up. Mean T was comparable in current and non-smokers, whilst mean DHT was lower in ex- and current smokers compared to non-smokers. After adjusting for confounders including smoking, higher T or DHT was associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer (SHR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.60; p = 0.012 per 1 SD increase in T and SHR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54; p = 0.004 for DHT). Sex hormones were not associated with prostate or colorectal cancer. In older men, higher T or DHT predict increased incidence of lung cancer over the next decade.

Existing guidelines recommend against LND at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) in low-risk men, yet this is still a common practice.  Materials and methods:   The 2013 National Cancer Database includes 1,208,180 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2013. Of these, 50,245 met D'Amico low-risk criteria, had complete clinicopathologic data, and underwent RP. Mixed effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify hospital and treatment characteristics independently associated with LND, extended LND, and the detection of lymph node metastasis.  Results:   A total of 20,556 men (40.9%) underwent LND and 4360 (8.7%) had extended LND. Lymph node metastasis was present in 76 cases (0.37%). On multivariable analysis, robotic vs open RP had odds ratio (OR) = 0.16 (0.14-0.17), P < .0001, for LND, and surgery at an academic center had OR = 1.76 (1.33-2.33), P < .0001, for LND. Men on Medicaid were less likely than the privately insured to undergo LND, and the highest earners were most likely to undergo LND. In multivariable analysis, race was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, with black men having the highest rates (P < .0001).  Conclusion:   LND is performed in nearly half of low-risk men, more commonly during open surgery at academic centers, yet metastasis is discovered less than 1% of the time. Guidelines suggest that percentage core involvement should be considered, but if the overall risk of metastasis is low, LND should not be performed.""","""['Heather J Chalfin', 'Zhaoyong Feng', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Alan W Partin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'The Effect of Lymph Node Dissection in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of Survival and Early Postoperative Outcomes.', 'Racial disparities in lymph node dissection at radical prostatectomy: A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database analysis.', 'Head-to-head comparison of lymph node density and number of positive lymph nodes in stratifying the outcome of patients with lymph node-positive prostate cancer submitted to radical prostatectomy and extended lymph node dissection.', ""Effect of Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection on Oncologic Outcomes in Patients with D'Amico Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-Institutional Study."", 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Utilization of Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

However, the protein expression level and the function of HoxD10 in prostate cancer remain unknown. Using tissue microarray, we demonstrate that the protein expression of HoxD10 is commonly decreased in prostate cancer tissues (n = 92) compared to adjacent benign prostate tissues (n = 77). Functionally, knockdown of HoxD10 resulted in significant promotion of prostate cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, knockdown of HoxD10 strikingly stimulated prostate tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. We also found a significant association between decreased immunohistochemical staining of HoxD10 expression and higher Gleason score (P = 0.031) and advanced clinical pathological stage (P = 0.011). An analysis of the Taylor database revealed that decreased HoxD10 expression predicted worse biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival of PCa patients (P = 0.005) and the multivariate analyses further supported that HoxD10 might be an independent predictor for BCR-free survival (P = 0.027). Collectively, our data suggest that the loss of HoxD10 function is common and may thus result in a progressive phenotype in PCa.

It has been reported that SHARPIN is highly expressed in several human tumors including ovarian cancer and liver cancer. We found that SHARPIN is also highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines of DU145, LNCAP, and PC-3. Suppression of SHARPIN caused an inhibition of NF-κB signal and decreases in tumorigenesis of cultured cells in NOD/SCID mouse model. Overexpression of SHARPIN in prostate cancer cells promoted cell growth and reduced apoptosis through NF-kB/ERK/Akt pathway and apoptosis-associated proteins.  Methods:   We analyzed the expression of SHARPIN in prostate cancer tissues from 95 patients and its relationship with other clinical characteristics associated with PCA malignancies and patient survivals, and examined the impacts of SHARPIN suppression with siRNA on proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and expression levels of MMP-9 of prostate cancer cells and metastasis to lung by these cells in nude mice.  Results:   High levels of SHARPIN were associated with high malignancies of PCA and predicted shorter survivals of PCA patients.

However, little is known about the roles of LCP1 in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). This present study sought to clarify the clinical relevance of LCP1 in OSCCs and investigate possible clinical applications for treating OSCCs by regulating LCP1 expression. We found up-regulation of LCP1in OSCCs compared with normal counterparts using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (P < 0.05). We used shRNA models for LCP1 (shLCP1) and enoxacin (ENX), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic drug, as a regulator of LCP1 expression. In addition to the LCP1 knockdown experiments in which shLCP1 cells showed several depressed functions, including cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and migratory activities, ENX-treated cells also had attenuated functions. Consistent with our hypothesis from our in vitro data, LCP1-positive OSCC samples were correlated closely with the primary tumoral size and regional lymph node metastasis. These results suggested that LCP1 is a useful biomarker for determining progression of OSCCs and that ENX might be a new therapeutic agent for treating OSCCs by controlling LCP1 expression.""","""['Nao Koide', 'Atsushi Kasamatsu', 'Yosuke Endo-Sakamoto', 'Sho Ishida', 'Toshihiro Shimizu', 'Yasushi Kimura', 'Isao Miyamoto', 'Shusaku Yoshimura', 'Masashi Shiiba', 'Hideki Tanzawa', 'Katsuhiro Uzawa']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Adenosine A2b receptor promotes progression of human oral cancer.', 'Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase1 overexpression promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma progression via enhanced biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor.', 'FBLIM1 enhances oral cancer malignancy via modulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway.', 'ALY as a potential contributor to metastasis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Dermatopontin: a potential predictor for metastasis of human oral cancer.', 'Extracellular Vesicle-Based Drug Delivery Systems for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'Inhibition of the Glycolysis Prevents the Cerebral Infarction Progression Through Decreasing the Lactylation Levels of LCP1.', 'Transcriptome Profiling Analysis Identifies LCP1 as a Contributor for Chidamide Resistance in Gastric Cancer.', 'New Proteins Contributing to Immune Cell Infiltration and Pannus Formation of Synovial Membrane from Arthritis Diseases.', 'Aberrant GIMAP2 expression affects oral squamous cell carcinoma progression by promoting cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis.']"""

Elevated CaMKK2 activity is strongly associated with prostate and hepatic cancers, whereas reduced CaMKK2 activity has been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disease in humans. Here we report the functional effects of nine rare-variant point mutations that were detected in large-scale human genetic studies and cancer tissues, all of which occur close to two regulatory phosphorylation sites and the catalytic site on human CaMKK2. Four mutations (G87R, R139W, R142W and E268K) cause a marked decrease in Ca2+-independent autonomous activity, however S137L and P138S mutants displayed increased autonomous and Ca2+-CaM stimulated activities. Furthermore, the G87R mutant is defective in Thr85-autophosphorylation dependent autonomous activity, whereas the A329T mutation rendered CaMKK2 virtually insensitive to Ca2+-CaM stimulation. The G87R and R139W mutants behave as dominant-negative inhibitors of CaMKK2 signaling in cells as they block phosphorylation of the downstream substrate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in response to ionomycin.

Two-hundred and five patients with pT3N0M0 who underwent robot-assisted RP without ART were analyzed. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses were used to identify predictors of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical progression (CP). The estimated 5-year BCR-free survival (BCRFS) and CP-free survival (CPFS) were 52.8% and 85.6%, respectively.

Based on these factors, a risk stratification tool was developed. Patients with no risk factors (PSA <10 ng ml-1 , pGS 6, and absent LVI) showed excellent BCRFS and CPFS at 5 years (91.9% and 100.0%, respectively), but those with two or more risk factors (PSA ≥10 ng ml-1 , pGS ≥8, or present LVI) had poor BCRFS and CPFS (12.1% and 54.6%, respectively). In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic stage pT3b (HR: 5.393; P = 0.025) was the only predictor of CP.

A prospective randomized multicenter international study""","""Introduction:   Osteoporosis is a complication of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate carcinoma. The best defense against osteoporosis in prostate cancer is to identify patients with a high risk for fracture during the first clinical visit, select an effective anti-osteoporosis agent, and advise the patient to change his lifestyle and diet to prevent further bone loss. New agents include denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the RANK ligand (RANKL). RANKL promotes the formation, activity, and survival of osteoclasts and, thus, supports the breakdown of bone.  Purpose:   This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind prospective study on use of denosumab versus alendronate in the therapy of secondary osteoporosis related to ADT in prostate cancer patients in three European countries (Italy, France, Switzerland).  Patients and methods:   In this 24-month observation study we enrolled 234 patients with diagnosis of osteoporosis underwent ADT for prostate cancer. All patients aged ≥55 years and had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) T-score <-1.0 (hip or spine, measured within last 2 years) and ≥ 1 fragility fracture. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months or alendronate (70 mg weekly) for 2 years. All patient received supplemental vitamin D (600 IU per day) and supplemental calcium to maintain a calcium intake of 1200 mg per day. Effectiveness of therapy in both groups (denosumab group and alendronate group) was assessed by changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs), Bone Mineral Density (BMD), fracture incidence, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for back pain, and Short Form-8 (SF-8TM) health survey score for health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Percent changes from baseline in BTMs and BMD were assessed using the paired t test; a P-value 0.05). Mean changes in BMD at final follow-up differed significantly between two groups. BMD changes at the lumbar spine at 24 months were 5.6% with denosumab vs -1.1% with alendronate (P<0.001). New vertebral fractures developed in fewer patients in the denosumab group than in the alendronate group during the 24-month period, although this difference was not significant (P=0.10). Back pain significantly (P<0.001) improved from baseline at all time points during the study in both study groups. SF-8 health survey scores significantly improved following treatment with both drugs. Incidence of adverse drug reactions were similar in both groups.  Conclusion:   In our study denosumab and alendronate showed similar clinical efficacy in the therapy of ADT-related osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma; both drugs provided significant improvements in back pain and general health conditions. Denosumab showed significant increase of BTMs and BMD than alendronate with lower rate of new vertebral fractures.""","""['Carlo Doria', 'Paolo Tranquilli Leali', 'Federico Solla', 'Gianluca Maestretti', 'Massimo Balsano', 'Robero Mario Scarpa']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Clin Cases Miner Bone Metab""","""['Treatment of osteoporosis secondary to hypogonadism in prostate cancer patients: a prospective randomized multicenter international study with denosumab vs. alendronate.', 'Effects of denosumab on bone mineral density and bone turnover in postmenopausal women transitioning from alendronate therapy.', 'A phase 3, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of oral weekly alendronate for the prevention of androgen deprivation bone loss in nonmetastatic prostate cancer: the Cancer and Osteoporosis Research with Alendronate and Leuprolide (CORAL) study.', 'Denosumab for bone health in prostate and breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy?

Methods and results:   As a pilot study, whole sections of 51 cases of liver metastatic carcinoma with different origins-colorectum (n = 32), breast (n = 3), oesophagogastric tract (n = 4), lung (n = 3), pancreas (n = 8), and prostate (n = 1)-were immunostained with CDX1, CDX2, and A33. A33 showed higher sensitivity as a CRC immunomarker, greater interobserver reproducibility for assessment of expression and less background cross-reactivity than CDX1. Therefore, only A33 was compared with CDX2 for a tissue microarray (TMA)-based study of primary adenocarcinomas with different origins: CRC (n = 55), liver deposits of metastatic CRC (n = 60), breast (n = 101), lung (n = 40), oesophagogastric tract (n = 134), ovary (n = 67), pancreas (n = 77), and prostate (n = 56).

When the whole section and TMA cases of non-colorectal carcinomas were combined, A33 had a specificity of 85.4% as a marker of CRC and CDX2 had a specificity of 64.3%. The higher specificity of A33 than of CDX2 as a CRC immunomarker was particularly seen among pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas.

In addition, the identified potential protein markers were further validated in CaP-RR cell lines and subcutaneous (s.c) animal xenografts by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively and protein aldolase A (ALDOA) was selected for a radiosensitivity study. We found the depletion of ALDOA combined with radiotherapy effectively reduced colony formation, induced more apoptosis and increased radiosensitivity in CaP-RR cells. Our findings indicate that CaP radioresistance is caused by multifactorial traits and downregulation of ALDOA increases radiosensitivity in CaP-RR cells, suggesting that controlling these identified proteins or signaling pathways in combination with radiotherapy may hold promise to overcome CaP radioresistance.""","""['Lei Chang', 'Jie Ni', 'Julia Beretov', 'Valerie C Wasinger', 'Jingli Hao', 'Joseph Bucci', 'David Malouf', 'David Gillatt', 'Peter H Graham', 'Yong Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Proteomic identification of the lactate dehydrogenase A in a radioresistant prostate cancer xenograft mouse model for improving radiotherapy.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Intracellular signaling pathways regulating radioresistance of human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the treatment of prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'An overview of glioblastoma multiforme and temozolomide resistance: can LC-MS-based proteomics reveal the fundamental mechanism of temozolomide resistance?', 'Insights into the regulation of energy metabolism during the seed-to-seedling transition in marine angiosperm Zostera marina L.: Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Advances in mass spectrometry imaging for spatial cancer metabolomics.', 'Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism and autophagy in granulosa cells of women with endometriosis.']"""

AR variants can be generated by genomic alterations and alternative splicing, and their expression is androgen-regulated. There has been a suggestion that AR variants bearing premature termination codons and coding for truncated proteins should be regulated by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mRNA surveillance pathway, suggesting that either the NMD pathway is dysfunctional in variant-expressing cell lines or that variants are somehow able to evade degradation by NMD.  Methods:   We first used siRNA knockdown of the NMD regulator, UPF1, in an NMD reporter assay to determine if this surveillance pathway is functioning normally in AR variant-expressing cell lines. We then used UPF1 knockdown to determine if expression of the AR variants ARV3 and ARV7 is affected by inhibition of NMD. Next, we analyzed androgen regulation of UPF1 and used transcript expression analysis to determine if there is any association between UPF1 expression, resistance, and ARV3 or ARV7 expression.  Results:   We found that the NMD pathway functions normally in the AR variant-expressing cell line 22Rv1 and that inhibition of NMD does not increase expression of ARV3 or ARV7. Furthermore, we found that expression of UPF1 is not androgen-regulated. We also found that UFP1 expression levels do not differentiate castration-sensitive from resistant cell line and that UPF1 expression does not correlate with expression of ARV3 or ARV7 in cells in which these variants are highly expressed.  Conclusion:   This study eliminates a possible mechanism of regulation of certain AR variants. Future research into the regulation of AR variants should focus on other mechanisms to better understand the origin of these variants and to possibly inhibit their expression for the resensitization of resistant cancers.

Few studies have investigated personal and contextual factors associated with the extent of preparedness for re-entry or how they are related to cancer-related symptom management.  Purpose:   Data from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivor Transition Study examined (1) characteristics of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors (n = 1188) within the first year of completing treatment who are most and least prepared for re-entry; and (2) how preparedness level and other characteristics are related to cancer-related symptom management.  Methods:   Stanton and colleagues' [1] conceptual model of survivorship guided the selection of interpersonal/environmental, individual, and disease/treatment-related characteristics as potential contributors to levels of preparedness and cancer-related symptom management using regression tree and multivariate linear regression analyses.  Results:   Survivors, on average, felt moderately prepared for the transition to post-treatment care. Lowest levels of preparedness were found among survivors with relatively high depressive symptoms, low perceived quality of oncology-provided survivorship care, and limited discussion about potential side effects with a health professional. Poorer symptom management was associated with younger age, having more comorbid conditions, and lower preparedness, social support, and spirituality.  Conclusion:   Survivors who feel unprepared for the transition to post-treatment care report poorer cancer-related symptom management. Identification of factors associated with low perceived preparedness and poor cancer-related symptom management will assist in risk stratification and development of tailored interventions to meet the needs of cancer survivors during re-entry.""","""['Corinne R Leach', 'Alyssa N Troeschel', 'Dawn Wiatrek', 'Annette L Stanton', 'Michael Diefenbach', 'Kevin D Stein', 'Katherine Sharpe', 'Kenneth Portier']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Behav Med""","""['A longitudinal study of four unique trajectories of psychological distress in cancer survivors after completing potentially curative treatment.', 'Empowering survivors after colorectal and lung cancer treatment: Pilot study of a Self-Management Survivorship Care Planning intervention.', 'Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', 'The role of psychosocial resources for long-term breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors: prevalence and associations with health-related quality of life.', 'Understanding acceptability of and engagement with Web-based interventions aiming to improve quality of life in cancer survivors: A synthesis of current research.', 'Factors associated with health-related quality of life in a cohort of cancer survivors in New Jersey.', 'Self-efficacy in managing post-treatment care among oral and oropharyngeal cancer survivors.', ""Cancer Survivors' Disability Experiences and Identities: A Qualitative Exploration to Advance Cancer Equity."", 'Getting back on track: a group psychoeducational intervention for patients and families living with head and neck cancer.', 'Predictors of Outpatient Pulmonary Rehabilitation Uptake, Adherence, Completion, and Treatment Response Among Male U.S. Veterans With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.']"""

RNF6 increased breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and reduced cell sensitivity to doxorubicin. Further studies showed that RNF6 was closely associated with increased expression of estrogen receptor, a critical factor in the development of breast cancers. RNF6 was found to induce ERα expression and increased its stability. In doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells, RNF6 was found to be elevated in association with increased ERα and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, but not pro-apoptotic Bim-1. In consistence with this finding, overexpression of ERα led to increased Bcl-xL but had no effects on Bim-1.

The burden of cancer mortality within Hispanic groups has not been well quantified.Methods: Cancer mortality rates for 2008-2012 in Florida were computed on the basis of race, ethnicity, and birthplace, specifically focusing on major Hispanic groups-Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, South Americans, and Dominicans. Age-adjusted mortality rate ratios derived from negative binomial regression were used to compare Hispanics, aggregated and by group, to nonHispanic whites (NHW).Results: A total of 205,369 cancer deaths from 2008-2012 were analyzed, of which 22,042 occurred in Hispanics. Overall cancer mortality rates were lower for Hispanics, 159 and 100 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively, compared with 204 and 145 per 100,000 in NHWs, largely driven by relatively low rates of lung and breast cancers among Hispanics. However, Hispanics had a higher risk of death from stomach and liver cancers, both infection-related. Of all Hispanic groups, Mexicans had the lowest mortality, whereas Cubans had the highest, with significantly higher mortality for colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers.Conclusions: Compared with other Hispanic groups, Cubans and Puerto Ricans had significantly higher rates. For these longer-established populations in the United States, increases in diet and obesity-related cancers are evident. Some groups show excesses that clearly fall out of the common Hispanic patterns, with implications for public health: Cubans for colorectal cancer, Puerto Ricans for liver cancer, and Dominicans for prostate cancer.Impact: Cancer mortality outcomes in Hispanics vary between ethnic groups.

This study aimed to elucidate the relevant molecular mechanism, focusing on NF-κB transcription factor. We examined the activity of NF-κB after PKC inhibition, and the expression of Twist1 and AR after inhibition of NF-κB in human prostate cancer cells. We also investigated the status of PKC/NF-κB after inhibition of AR signaling in cells resistant to hormonal therapy. As a result, inhibition of PKC signaling using knockdown and small-molecule inhibition of PKC suppressed RelA activity, while blocking NF-κB suppressed Twist1 and AR expression. Conversely, inhibition of AR signaling by androgen depletion and the novel antiandrogen enzalutamide induced PKC and RelA activation, resulting in Twist1/AR induction at the transcript level. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB signaling prevented enzalutamide-induced Twist1 and AR induction. Finally, NF-κB was activated in both castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells. In conclusion, NF-κB signaling was responsible for Twist1 upregulation by PKC in response to AR inhibition, resulting in aberrant activation of AR.

Results:   A total of 105 patients treated between September 2010 and November 2013 were reviewed. Median follow-up was 41 months, with 97% of patients followed for more than 26 months. Median ADT duration was 18 months. Acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity was seen in 18 (17%) and 19 (17%) patients, respectively, with only 1 and 3 patients experiencing either a GI or GU acute grade 3 toxicity. The worst grade 2 or higher late GI and GU toxicity were seen in 7 (7%) and 8 (8%) patients, respectively. There was no grade 4 or 5 toxicity. At the last follow-up, the rate of grade 2 GI and GU toxicity was 5% and 3%, respectively, with no residual grade ≥3 toxicity. The 48-month actuarial progression free survival is 82%.  Conclusions:   ADT with moderate HypoRT delivered with IMRT and an integrated simultaneous boost to the prostate (60 Gy) and pelvic nodes (44 Gy) in 20 fractions is feasible and well tolerated. This approach shortens treatment duration and is convenient for patients and the health system, and its results support a randomized trial.""","""['Sergio Faria', 'Russel Ruo', 'Fabio Cury', 'Marie Duclos', 'Luis Souhami']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Long-Term Results of Moderate Hypofractionation to Prostate and Pelvic Nodes Plus Androgen Suppression in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypofractionated radiation therapy (66 Gy in 22 fractions at 3 Gy per fraction) for favorable-risk prostate cancer: long-term outcomes.', 'Acute toxicity in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with androgen suppression and hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis along with Therapeutic Implications.', 'Genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity among patients with localized prostate cancer treated with conventional versus moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Toxicity and risk factors after combined high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy in men ≥75\xa0years with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This multi-institutional retrospective analysis comprised 3424 patients with localized prostate cancer at 16 Asian hospitals. One-thirds (27.7%) of patients received only neoadjuvant ADT, whereas almost half (49.5%) of patients received both neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT. Mean duration of neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT were 8.6 months and 27.9 months, respectively. Biochemical failure was defined by Phoenix ASTRO consensus. Biochemical control rate, clinical disease-free survival (cDFS), cause-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were calculated.  Results:   Median followup was 66 months. Ten-year biochemical control, cDFS, cause-specific survival, and OS rate were 81.4%, 81.0%, 97.2%, and 85.6%, respectively. Receiving both neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT was detected as a favorable factor for biochemical control, cDFS, and OS, but pelvic irradiation was detected as an adverse factor for cause-specific survival, and OS. Ten-year cumulative rates of late Grade ≥2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 26.8% and 4.1%, respectively; receiving both neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT was detected as a favorable factor for preventing both toxicities.  Conclusions:   HDR combined with external beam radiotherapy was an effective and safe treatment for localized prostate cancer. Combination of long-term ADT was suggested to be necessary, even for HDR brachytherapy, and was useful in suppressing late toxicities.

Investigations of leukocyte telomere length as a prognostic factor in prostate cancer are, however, lacking. In this study, leukocyte telomere length was investigated both as a risk marker, comparing control subjects and patient risk groups (based on serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, tumor differentiation, and tumor stage), and as a prognostic marker for metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival. Relative telomere length was measured by a well-established quantitative polymerase chain reaction method in 415 consecutively sampled individuals. Statistical evaluation included 162 control subjects without cancer development during follow-up and 110 untreated patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer at the time of blood draw. Leukocyte telomere length did not differ significantly between control subjects and patients, or between patient risk groups. Interestingly, however, and in line with our previous results in breast and kidney cancer patients, relative telomere length at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor. Patients with long leukocyte telomeres (⩾median) had a significantly worse prostate cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival compared to patients with short telomere length. In contrast, for patients who died of other causes than prostate cancer, long relative telomere length was not coupled to shorter survival time.

A longitudinal survey of female partners of men newly diagnosed with local-stage prostate cancer was conducted in three different geographic regions. Partners and associated patients were surveyed at baseline (after patient diagnosis but prior to receiving therapy) and at 12 months following diagnosis. Information sources included provider, literature, friends or family members, Internet websites, books, traditional media, and support groups. Utility of an information source was defined as whether the partner would recommend it to caregivers of other patients with local-stage prostate cancer. Our study cohort included 179 partner-patient pairs. At diagnosis, partners consulted an average of 4.6 information sources. Non-Hispanic white partners were more likely than others to use friends and family as an information source (OR = 2.44, 95% CI (1.04, 5.56)).

Materials and methods:   With data from all first-time prostate biopsies performed between January 2012 and March 2015 across the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC), we developed a multinomial logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of finding high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥7), low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤6), or no cancer on prostate biopsy. The performance of the MUSIC model was evaluated in out-of-sample data using 10-fold cross-validation. Discrimination and calibration statistics were used to compare the performance of the MUSIC model to that of the PCPT risk calculator in the MUSIC cohort.  Results:   Of the 11,809 biopsies included, 4289 (36.3%) revealed high-grade cancer; 2027 (17.2%) revealed low-grade cancer; and the remaining 5493 (46.5%) were negative. In the MUSIC model, prostate-specific antigen level, rectal examination findings, age, race, and family history of prostate cancer were significant predictors of finding high-grade cancer on biopsy. The 2 models, based on similar predictors, had comparable discrimination (multiclass area under the curve = 0.63 for the MUSIC model and 0.62 for the PCPT calculator). Calibration analyses demonstrated that the MUSIC model more accurately predicted observed outcomes, whereas the PCPT risk calculator substantively overestimated the likelihood of finding no cancer while underestimating the risk of high-grade cancer in this population.

Twenty-seven, Twenty-four, and one PC were respectively low, intermediate and high risk according to d'Amico classification. Forty-three patients were treated by radical prostatectomy (RP): 28 retropubic, 15 laparoscopic and 3 by a perineal approach. Eighteen patients had a lymph node dissection. Four patients were treated with external radiotherapy and 2 by brachytherapy. Eight patients underwent radiotherapy after surgery. The median time between PC treatment and RT was 35.7 months.

The aim of this study was to examine SIPA1 expression and its functional mechanisms in OSCC. SIPA1 mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The expressions of SIPA1 were up-regulated significantly in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SIPA1 expression was correlated with regional lymph node metastasis. We next assessed the cellular functions associated with tumoral metastasis using SIPA1 knockdown (shSIPA1) cells and analyzed the downstream molecules of SIPA1, i.e., bromodomain containing protein 4(BRD4), integrin beta1 (ITGB1), and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). The shSIPA1 cells showed decreased invasiveness and migratory activities, however cellular adhesion ability was maintained at a high level. In addition, ITGB1 expression was greater in shSIPA1 cells, whereas MMP7 expression was lower than in control cells. This research is the first to establish that SIPA1 promotes cancer metastasis by regulating the ITGB1 and MMP7.

Material and methods:   From December 2012 to February 2016, 125 patients, previously having undergone radical prostatectomy, received adjuvant (64 patients) or salvage (61 patients) radiotherapy (RT) inside an institutional protocol of moderate hypofractionation schedule using the VMAT technique (Varian RapidArc, Palo Alto, CA). Eligible patients were < 85 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate without distant metastases, and pathologic stage pT2-4 N0-1, with at least 1 of the following risk factors: capsular perforation, positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion, and/or postoperative prostate-specific antigen > 0.2 ng/mL. Patients were stratified into low (1%), intermediate (9%), and high-risk (90%) groups. The median age was 68 years. The median doses were 66 Gy (range, 65.5-71.4 Gy) to the prostatic bed and 52.5 Gy (range, 50.4-54 Gy) to the pelvic lymph nodes, in 28 or 30 fractions. The acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.  Results:   All 125 patients completed the planned treatment, with good tolerance. After RT, the median follow-up was 18 months. Acute toxicities were recorded for the GU (G0, 45/125 [36%]; G1, 63/125 [50.4%]; G2, 16/125 [12.8%]; G3, 1/125 [0.8%]) and the GI (G0, 42/125 [33.6%]; G1, 72/125 [57.6%]; G2, 11/125 [8.8%]; no G3). Analyzing data according to RT intent, a higher rate of GU toxicity ≥ 2 was found in the adjuvant setting (17.1%) with respect to the salvage group (9.8%); P = .01 with the Fisher exact text. Furthermore, at statistical analysis, no difference was found between the type of surgery (robotic, laparoscopic, or open) and incidence of urinary incontinence (P = .8). The actuarial Kaplan-Meier rates for biochemical disease-free survival were 94% and 77% for adjuvant and salvage RT, at 36 months.  Conclusions:   Moderate hypofractionated postoperative RT with VMAT was feasible and safe with acceptable acute GU and GI toxicities.

The chronic disease benign prostatic hyperplasia belongs to the same ilk, except that the infection process is much more subtle and complex. The enzyme Phospholipase D (PLD) which is attached to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has now been almost completely proven to be the basic cause of BPH. The evidence for this process is now extremely strong and compelling. PLD obtained from the organism Streptomyces chromofuscus has been used in past research because of its PLD content. It is commercially available. In vitro, on a culture of prostatic smooth muscle, PLD stimulated the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which acted on and caused substantial growth of that muscle in accordance with the quantity of PLD/ LPA generated. It has been asserted that repeated colonization by E. coli of the transitional zone of the prostate gland and the release of PLD following repeated destruction of these colonized bacteria, is the basic cause of BPH. The evidence for colonizing and re-colonizing infection is now overwhelming. PLD is a simple lipid consisting of a phosphate, glycerol and a fatty acid. After absorption into the prostatic stroma (which consists of connective tissue and of smooth muscle), it stimulates the production of LPA which, in turn, apart from directly stimulating prostatic smooth muscle, also acts on the connective tissue in the prostate and induces a complex mixture of growth regulatory proteins, which include members of the fibroblast, insulin-like and growth transforming factor families and implicates autocrine hormones acting on the stroma and paracrine hormones acting on epithelium. Also involved, are a variety of interleukins and other inflammatory cell cytokines, secreted by the stroma, which may further promote autocrine/paracrine proliferation of BPH cells. Cadherins involved in cell adhesion and possibly chalone which exerts negative effects, must also be considered. Overall, the degree of BPH that any older male develops is governed largely by: Apart from providing the existing huge evidence for infection in BPH, this manuscript explains the production, release and absorption of PLD into the prostate gland where it is converted to LPA. This is a growth factor and acts within the prostate both on smooth muscle (research proof given) and on prostatic connective tissue, resulting in BPH. This manuscript indicates the vital research, including the requisite materials, which would readily provide irrefutable and final etiological proof of all of the hormones involved. It explains how, to a large extent, the use of a vaccine which is now being developed, would likely allow the ultimate prevention of this ubiquitous disease.""","""['W G Roper']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['Proliferative disorders of the aging human prostate: involvement of protein hormones and their receptors.', 'Androgens and estrogens: their interaction with stroma and epithelium of human benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal prostate.', 'Clinical and experimental studies of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Role of stroma in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Increased expression of CYR61, an extracellular matrix signaling protein, in human benign prostatic hyperplasia and its regulation by lysophosphatidic acid.', 'Panax ginseng C.A. meyer alleviates benign prostatic hyperplasia while preventing finasteride-induced side effects.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'Analysis of risk factors for post-bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced prostatitis in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'Oral exposure of sulpiride promotes the proliferation of Brown-Norway rat prostates.']"""

Emerging evidence suggests that Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor) is a unique chaperone or scaffolding protein that contributes to cellular protein homeostasis. We reported previously that some Sigma1-selective small molecules can be used to pharmacologically modulate protein homeostasis pathways. We hypothesized that these Sigma1-mediated responses could be exploited to suppress AR protein levels and activity. Here we demonstrate that treatment with a small-molecule Sigma1 inhibitor prevented 5α- dihydrotestosterone-mediated nuclear translocation of AR and induced proteasomal degradation of AR and ARV, suppressing the transcriptional activity and protein levels of both full-length and splice-variant AR. Consistent with these data, RNAi knockdown of Sigma1 resulted in decreased AR levels and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Sigma1 physically associated with ARV7 and ARv567es as well as full-length AR. Treatment of mice xenografted with ARV-driven CRPC tumors with a drug-like small-molecule Sigma1 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor growth associated with elimination of AR and ARV7 in responsive tumors. Together, our data show that Sigma1 modulators can be used to suppress AR/ARV-driven prostate cancer cells via regulation of pharmacologically responsive Sigma1-AR/ARV interactions, both in vitro and in vivoCancer Res; 77(9); 2439-52. ©2017 AACR.""","""['Jeffrey D Thomas', 'Charles G Longen', 'Halley M Oyer', 'Nan Chen', 'Christina M Maher', 'Joseph M Salvino', 'Blase Kania', 'Kelsey N Anderson', 'William F Ostrander', 'Karen E Knudsen', 'Felix J Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Targeting the Hsp40/Hsp70 Chaperone Axis as a Novel Strategy to Treat Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An Emerging Role for Sigma Receptor 1 in Personalized Treatment of Breast Cancer.', 'Targeting Both Autophagy and Immunotherapy in Breast Cancer Treatment.', 'Sigma-1 Receptor in Retina: Neuroprotective Effects and Potential Mechanisms.', 'Revisiting the sigma-1 receptor as a biological target to treat affective and cognitive disorders.', ""Sigmar1's Molecular, Cellular, and Biological Functions in Regulating Cellular Pathophysiology.""]"""

Materials and methods:   Overall 289 prospectively enrolled men underwent magnetic resonance imaging followed by repeat systematic and targeted biopsies of any suspicious lesions at baseline. A total of 194 patients with low suspicion magnetic resonance imaging or benign target biopsies were suitable for this study. Those who were negative for prostate cancer at baseline were followed for at least 3 years. We calculated the negative predictive values of magnetic resonance imaging in ruling out any prostate cancer and significant prostate cancer, defined as any core with Gleason score greater than 6, or more than 2 positive cores/cancerous core 50% or greater.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 38 of 194 (20%) patients during the median study period of 47 months (IQR 43-52). The overall negative predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging in ruling out any and significant prostate cancer was 80% (156 of 194) and 95% (184 of 194), respectively. No patient with low suspicion magnetic resonance imaging had intermediate/high grade cancer (Gleason score greater than 6). The majority of patients with no cancer during followup (132 of 156, 85%) had a decreasing prostate specific antigen and could be monitored in primary care.

In prostate cancer (PCa), elevated expression of miR-30d that targets SOCS1 mRNA is associated with increased risk of disease recurrence. SOCS1 can mediate its tumor suppressor functions by diverse mechanisms such as inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, promoting the tumor suppressor functions of p53, attenuating MET receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and blocking the oncogenic potential of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1 (p21). Here, we studied the expression of SOCS1 and the downstream targets of its putative tumor suppressor functions (p53, MET and p21) in human PCa specimens to evaluate their significance as markers of disease prognosis.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed of 78 archived prostatectomy specimens that were grouped according to the recommendations of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) based on the Gleason patterns. SOCS1, p53, MET and p21 protein expression were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining alongside the common prostate cancer-related markers Ki67, prostein and androgen receptor. Statistical correlations between the staining intensities of these markers and ISUP grade groups, local invasion or lymph node metastasis were evaluated.  Results:   SOCS1 showed diffuse staining in the prostatic epithelium. SOCS1 staining intensity correlated inversely with the ISUP grade groups (ρ = -0.4687, p <0.0001) and Ki67 (ρ = -0.2444, p = 0.031), and positively with prostein (ρ = 0.3511, p = 0.0016). Changes in SOCS1 levels did not significantly associate with those of p53, MET or p21. However, p21 positively correlated with androgen receptor expression (ρ = -0.1388, p = 0.0003).

The chromosomal location of the TSPYL5 gene is 8Q22.1, and its exact role in prostate cancer etiology remains unclear. Further TSPYL5 gene and protein expression in prostate carcinoma cells and diseased tissues including its susceptibility for epigenetic silencing is unknown. Also, not known is the variation in TSPYL5 protein expression with regards to progression of prostatic carcinoma and its possible role in drug sensitivity.  Methods:   TSPYL5, DNMT-1 and DNMT-B gene expression in DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells and prostate tumor tissues was analyzed by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR. Demethylation experiments were done by treating DU145 and LNCaP cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in vitro. Methylation analysis of TSPYL5 gene was performed by methylation specific PCR and pyrosequencing. TSPYL5 protein expression in benign and diseased prostate tumor tissues was performed by immunohistochemistry and in the cells by Western blotting.  Results:   TSPYL5 was differentially expressed in non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), androgen independent (DU145), dependent (LNCaP) prostate carcinoma cells and tissues. Methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing analysis identified an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and expression leading to the silencing of TSPYL5 gene. Treatment of prostate carcinoma cells in which TSPYL5 was absent or low (DU145 and LNCaP) with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine upregulated its expression in these cells. Immunohistochemical studies clearly identified TSPYL5 protein in benign tissue and in tumors with Gleason score (GS) of 6 and 7. TSPYL5 protein levels were very low in tumors of GS ≥ 8. TSPYL5 overexpression in LNCaP cells increased the cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs such as docetaxel and paclitaxel, as measured by the cellular viability. Furthermore, the cells also exhibited reduced CDKN1A expression with only marginal reduction in pAKT.  Conclusions:   Decrease in TSPYL5 protein in advanced tumors might possibly function as an indicator of prostate tumor progression. Its absence due to methylation-induced silencing can lead to reduced drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma.""","""['Senthil R Kumar', 'Jeffrey N Bryan', 'Magda Esebua', 'James Amos-Landgraf', 'Tanner J May']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Activation of silenced tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer cells by a novel energy restriction-mimetic agent.', 'Adiponectin as a potential tumor suppressor inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition but frequently silenced in prostate cancer by promoter methylation.', ""Activation of p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits cell proliferation, induces pro-apoptotic genes and mitogen-activated protein kinases in human prostate cancer cells."", 'DNA demethylation and invasive cancer: implications for therapeutics.', 'The p53 protein plays a central role in the mechanism of action of epigentic drugs that alter the methylation of cytosine residues in DNA.', 'Olive Oil Improves While Trans Fatty Acids Further Aggravate the Hypomethylation of LINE-1 Retrotransposon DNA in an Environmental Carcinogen Model.', 'Targeting therapy-resistant lung cancer stem cells via disruption of the AKT/TSPYL5/PTEN positive-feedback loop.', 'Genome-wide methylation sequencing identifies progression-related epigenetic drivers in myelodysplastic syndromes.', 'TSPYL5 activates endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion in colorectal cancer.', 'Transplantation of Marginal Organs: Immunological Aspects and Therapeutic Perspectives in Kidney Transplantation.']"""

One key challenge for the clinical applications of RNAi is the safe and effective delivery of RNAi agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) to a particular nonliver diseased tissue (e.g., tumor) and cell type with sufficient cytosolic transport. In this work, we proposed a multifunctional envelope-type nanoparticle (NP) platform for prostate cancer (PCa)-specific in vivo siRNA delivery. A library of oligoarginine-functionalized and sharp pH-responsive polymers was synthesized and used for self-assembly with siRNA into NPs with the features of long blood circulation and pH-triggered oligoarginine-mediated endosomal membrane penetration. By further modification with ACUPA, a small molecular ligand specifically recognizing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor, this envelope-type nanoplatform with multifunctional properties can efficiently target PSMA-expressing PCa cells and silence target gene expression. Systemic delivery of the siRNA NPs can efficiently silence the expression of prohibitin 1 (PHB1), which is upregulated in PCa and other cancers, and significantly inhibit PCa tumor growth.

The exact role of the inflammatory Th17-IL-17 pathway in prostate cancer remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the importance of Th17 cells and IL-17 in a Pten-null prostate cancer mouse model.  Methods:   The Pten-null mice were treated by Th17 inhibitor SR1001 or anti-mouse IL-17 monoclonal antibody from 6 weeks of age up to 12 weeks of age. For SR1001 treatment, the mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a day with vehicle or SR1001, which was dissolved in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution. All mice were euthanized for necropsy at 12 weeks of age. For IL-17 antibody treatment, the mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) once every two weeks with control IgG or rat anti-mouse IL-17 monoclonal antibody, which was dissolved in PBS. The injection time points were at 6, 8, and 10 weeks old. All mice were analyzed for the prostate phenotypes at 12 weeks of age.  Results:   We found that either SR1001 or anti-IL-17 antibody treatment decreased the formation of micro-invasive prostate cancer in Pten-null mice. The SR1001 or anti-IL-17 antibody treated mouse prostates had reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced angiogenesis, as well as reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. By assessing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, we found that SR1001 or anti-IL-17 antibody treated prostate tissues had weaker EMT phenotype compared to the control treated prostates.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrated that Th17-IL-17 pathway plays a key role in prostate cancer progression in Pten-null mice. Targeting Th17-IL-17 pathway could prevent micro-invasive prostate cancer formation in mice.

Although treatment with enzalutamide, a second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, prolongs survival in prostate cancer patients, responses can be limited by intrinsic resistance or acquired resistance. A potential mechanism of resistance to androgen axis inhibition is evasion of apoptosis. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer and function to block apoptosis and promote survival signaling. Novel, small-molecule IAP antagonists, such as AEG40995, are emerging as a strategy to induce apoptosis and increase therapeutic response in cancer.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2 were treated with enzalutamide with or without addition of IAP antagonist AEG40995 and proliferation and survival were determined by MTS and clonogenic assay. Western blot was used to evaluate IAP protein expression changes and PARP-1 cleavage was assessed as indication of apoptosis. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze apoptosis in treated cells. Caspase activity was determined by luminescence assay. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunometric ELISA was used to assess TNF-α (transcript and protein levels, respectively) in response to treatment.  Results:   In this study, we demonstrate that IAP antagonist AEG40995 exhibits minimal effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation or survival, but rapidly degrades cIAP1 protein. Combination treatment with enzalutamide demonstrates that AEG40995 increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and clonogenic survival in cell line models of prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that apoptosis in response to enzalutamide and IAP antagonist requires activation of caspase-8, suggesting extrinsic/death receptor apoptosis signaling. Assessment of TNF-α in response to combination treatment with enzalutamide and AEG40995 reveals increased mRNA expression and autocrine protein secretion. Blocking TNF-α signaling abrogates the apoptotic response demonstrating that TNF-α plays a critical role in executing cell death in response to this drug combination.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that IAP antagonists can increase sensitivity and amplify the caspase-mediated apoptotic response to enzalutamide through TNF-α signaling mechanisms. Combination with an IAP antagonist increases enzalutamide sensitivity, lowers the apoptotic threshold and may combat drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.

An attractive strategy is label-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) due to its capability of providing structural fingerprinting of analytes that are close to or on nanomaterial surfaces. However, current label-free SERS approaches for DNA/RNA biomarker detection are limited to short and synthetic nucleic acid targets and have not been fully realized in clinical samples due to two possible reasons: (i) low target copies in limited patient samples and (ii) poor capability in identifying specific biomarkers from complex samples. To resolve these limitations and enable label-free SERS for clinical applications, we herein present a novel strategy based on multiplex reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) to enrich multiple RNA biomarkers, followed by label-free SERS with multivariate statistical analysis to directly detect, identify and distinguish between these long amplicons (∼200 bp). As a proof-of-concept clinical demonstration, we employed this strategy for non-invasive subtyping of prostate cancer (PCa).

Adoptive immunotherapy with Vγ2Vδ2 T cells has been used to treat cancer patients with partial and complete remissions. Most clinical trials and preclinical studies have used continuous zoledronate exposure to expand Vγ2Vδ2 cells where zoledronate is slowly diluted over the course of the culture. Zoledronate inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) in monocytes causing isopentenyl pyrophosphate to accumulate that then stimulates Vγ2Vδ2 cells. Because zoledronate inhibition of FDPS is also toxic for T cells, we hypothesized that a short period of exposure would reduce T cell toxicity but still be sufficient for monocytes uptake. Additionally, IL-15 increases the anti-tumor activity of murine αβ T cells in mice but its effect on the in vivo anti-tumor activity of human Vγ2Vδ2 cells has not been assessed.  Methods:   Human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells were expanded by pulse or continuous zoledronate stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 cells were tested for their expression of effector molecules and killing of tumor cells as well as their in vivo control of human prostate cancer tumors in immunodeficient NSG mice.  Results:   Pulse zoledronate stimulation with either IL-2 or IL-15 resulted in more uniform expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 cells with higher purity and cell numbers as compared with continuous exposure. The Vγ2Vδ2 cells had higher levels of CD107a and perforin and increased tumor cytotoxicity. Adoptive immunotherapy with Vγ2Vδ2 cells derived by pulse stimulation controlled human PC-3 prostate cancer tumors in NSG mice significantly better than those derived by continuous stimulation, halting tumor growth. Although pulse zoledronate stimulation with IL-15 preserved early memory subsets, adoptive immunotherapy with IL-15-derived Vγ2Vδ2 cells equally inhibited PC-3 tumor growth as those derived with IL-2.  Conclusions:   Pulse zoledronate stimulation maximizes the purity, quantity, and quality of expanded Vγ2Vδ2 cells for adoptive immunotherapy but there is no advantage to using IL-15 over IL-2 in our humanized mouse model. Pulse zoledronate stimulation is a simple modification to existing protocols that will enhance the effectiveness of adoptively transferred Vγ2Vδ2 cells by increasing their numbers and anti-tumor activity.""","""['Mohanad H Nada', 'Hong Wang', 'Grefachew Workalemahu', 'Yoshimasa Tanaka', 'Craig T Morita']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['PD-1 checkpoint blockade enhances adoptive immunotherapy by human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells against human prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and Immunomodulatory Activity of Fluorine-Containing Bisphosphonates.', 'Expansion of human γδ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy using a bisphosphonate prodrug.', 'Nonpeptide antigens, presentation mechanisms, and immunological memory of human Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells: discriminating friend from foe through the recognition of prenyl pyrophosphate antigens.', 'γδ cell-based immunotherapy for cancer.', 'An optimized cultivation method for future in vivo application of γδ T cells.', 'Nanomedicine for Combination Urologic Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Releasing the restraints of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Increased PD-1+Foxp3+ γδ T cells associate with poor overall survival for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Large Scale Ex Vivo Expansion of γδ T cells Using Artificial Antigen-presenting Cells.']"""

Medicare claims data were examined for initiation of cancer-directed treatment. Overall, AI/ANs experienced longer median times to starting treatment than NHWs (45 and 39 days, p &lt; .001) and lower rates of treatment initiation (HR[95%CI]: 0.86[0.79-0.93]). Differences were largest for prostate (HR: 0.80[0.71-0.89]) and smallest for breast cancer (HR: 0.96[0.83-1.11]). American Indians / Alaska Natives also had elevated odds of greater than 10 weeks between diagnosis and treatment compared with NHWs (OR[95% CI]: 1.37[1.16-1.63]), especially for prostate cancer (OR: 1.41[1.14-1.76]). Adjustment for comorbidity and socio-demographic factors attenuated associations except for prostate cancer. In this insured population, we observed evidence that AI/ANs start cancer therapy later than NHWs.

The objective of this study was to determine if screen-detected gallstones or cholecystectomy are associated with occurrence of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal cancers.  Methods:   We performed a cohort study of 3 randomly selected groups from the general population of Copenhagen. Participants (N = 5928) were examined from 1982 through 1992 and underwent abdominal ultrasound examination to detect gallstone disease, but were not informed of their gallstone status. Participants were followed for the occurrence of cancers through national registers until December 2014. We performed multivariable Cox regression analyses to identify factors associated with development of cancer.  Results:   Gallstone disease was identified in 10% of participants (591 of 5928); of these, 6.8% had gallstones and 3.2% had cholecystectomy at baseline. The population was followed for a median of 24.7 years (interquartile range, 18.9-32.4 years) with 1% lost. Pooled gastrointestinal cancers were associated with gallstone disease (11.2% of patients with gallstone disease vs 6.64% without; hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.01). Right-side colon cancer was also associated with gallstone disease (2.57% of patients with gallstone disease vs 0.96% without; hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.78). Pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, pooled colorectal, left-side colon, sigmoid colon, and rectal cancers were not associated with gallstone disease. Breast cancer had a weak association with gallstone disease depending on other factors (10.6% of patients with gallstone disease vs 7.41% without; hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.11). Pooled nongastrointestinal and prostate cancers were not associated with gallstone disease.  Conclusions:   Screen-detected gallstone disease in the general population is associated with pooled gastrointestinal and right-side colon cancers. These associations are not due to detection bias or cholecystectomy.
